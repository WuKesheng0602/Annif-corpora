ABSTRACT

Assessing the Performance of a UV/H2O2 Process for Removing TOC from Petroleum Refinery Wastewater and the Respirometric Effects of Adding UV/H2O2 Treated Wastewater to Activated Sludge from the Refinery WWTP Biological Treatment Process

Mark Knight, P.Eng. Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University 2014

The treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater was studied using a bench scale ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) process. The highest treatment performance of the bench scale UV/H2O2 process to reduce the total organic carbon (TOC) from the petroleum refinery wastewater took place at a reaction time of 45 min and a pH of 5.0. A three factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis verified that the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio did not have a significant effect on the bench scale UV/H2O2 process treatment performance. The effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process was studied using respirometry. Overall, the UV/H2O2 treated refinery wastewater inhibited the refinery activated sludge microorganisms. This occurred when the raw refinery wastewater was treated with a UV/H2O2 process for 45 min, with an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C, an initial H2O2 concentration of 202 mg H2O2/L and a pH of either 5 or 7. Keywords: Petroleum refinery wastewater treatment, UV/H2O2 process, wastewater treatment performance, inhibition of activated sludge, respirometry

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

Petroleum refineries use large quantities of water for cooling processes, desalting processes and stripping steam (Al Zarooni and Elshorbagy, 2006; Llop et al. 2009) which in turn generate large volumes of wastewater (Rebhun and Galil, 1988). Refinery wastewater can contain a variety of biodegradable, inhibitory and toxic organic and inorganic pollutants (Coe, 1952; Ruggles, 1959; Mahendrakaenrd and Viraraghavant, 1996; Juang et al. 1997; Al Zarooni and Elshorbagy, 2006; Wagner and Nicell, 2001; Galil and Wolf, 2001; Shokrollahzadeh et al, 2008; Llop et al. 2009) so a refinery's liquid effluent is regulated to meet a specific quality standard before it can be discharged to the environment. The main effluent regulation for refineries in Ontario is Ontario Regulation 537/93 the Municipal Industrial Strategy for Abatement (MISA) Effluent Monitoring and Effluent Limits for the Petroleum Sector. The two main goals of Ontario's MISA regulations were to create a comprehensive pollution control program to reduce all municipal and industrial waste loadings and to virtually eliminate the discharge of toxic contaminants to Ontario's waterways (Ontario, 1988). MISA is a command-and-control policy where a permit is issued by the provincial government to each industrial facility that discharges effluent to a body of surface water (MacDonald and Lintner, 2010). MISA is also a technology based standard (TBS) since each permit is based on pollution control technologies for a specific industry (Dupuy, 1997).

A typical petroleum refinery wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) uses a series of physical, chemical and biological treatment technologies to remove contaminants from the wastewater. Biological treatment by an activated sludge process is commonly used to treat petroleum refinery wastewater since it is generally the most economical method for reducing both wastewater toxicity and dissolved organic constituents (Qin et al. 2007). However,

petroleum refinery wastewater often contains a high concentration of compounds that could be toxic or inhibit the microorganisms in the biological treatment unit (Juang et al. 1997). A sudden load of high strength, non-biodegradable or toxic wastewater can lead to a WWTP discharging effluent that exceeds regulatory limits or even results in the failure of the biological treatment unit. This would require long periods of time to re-establish a reliable activated sludge which can impact the throughput of upstream refinery production units (Tyagi et al. 1992; Chavan and Mukherji, 2008). Therefore, additional advanced treatment technology may be required to

degrade these types of compounds. One promising area of research is the set of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). AOPs are a type of advanced wastewater technology that are effective at treating wastewater that contains non-biodegradable, inhibitory, or toxic compounds (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). The main advantage of AOPs is that the organic compounds in the wastewater can be completely converted to water and carbon dioxide without generating a residual solid waste by-product (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). An important disadvantage of AOPs is that the capital and operating costs are usually much higher when compared to conventional biological treatment processes (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). While the literature does show that AOPs are effective at treating industrial wastewater, there are very few examples of treating actual petroleum refinery wastewater, none of this
2

literature is from Canada, and none of this literature assesses the effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process (Niegowski, 1956; Juang et al. 1997; Adeyinka and RimRukeh, 1999; Huang et al. 1999; Andereozzi et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2001; Wagner and Nicell, 2001; Stepnowski et al. 2002; Mohammadzadeh et al. 2004; Chidambara and Quen, 2005; Saien and Nejati, 2007; Ting et al. 2007). There are two objectives to this work in order to evaluate if a UV/H2O2 process could be used as a pre-treatment process for a biological treatment unit at a refinery WWTP. The first objective is to assess the performance of a UV/H2O2 process to treat actual petroleum refinery wastewater. This will be accomplished by treating actual petroleum refinery wastewater with a bench scale UV/H2O2 process. The performance of the UV/H2O2 process will be assessed as its ability to remove soluble organic compounds measured as total organic carbon (TOC). The other objective is to assess the effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process. The effects of adding the UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater will be assessed as the amount of oxygen consumed by the activated sludge microorganisms using respirometry.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 PETROLEUM REFINERY WATER USE AND WASTEWATER GENERATION Petroleum refineries use large quantities of water for cooling processes, desalting processes and stripping steam (Al Zarooni and Elshorbagy, 2006; Llop et al. 2009) which in turn generate large volumes of wastewater (Rebhun and Galil, 1988). Since the volume and

composition of wastewater depends on the refinery size and process configuration (Al Zarooni and Elshorbagy, 2006), sources of refinery wastewater can be classified as either clean water, oily water, or process water (McKinney, 1967). Details of each source are outlined in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1: Petroleum Refinery Wastewater Types and Sources (Adapted from Coe, 1952; Ruggles, 1959; McKinney, 1967; Mahendrakaenrd and Viraraghavant, 1996; Galil and Wolf, 2001; Wagner and Nicell, 2001; Al Zarooni and Elshorbagy, 2006; Chavan and Mukherji, 2008; Shokrollahzadeh et al. 2008; WEF 2008; Llop et al. 2009).

Soluble and Non-soluble Biodegradable, Recalcitrant and Toxic Organic and Inorganic Compounds

Refinery wastewater can contain a variety of biodegradable, inhibitory and toxic organic and inorganic pollutants including alkanes (C10-C21), aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene, styrene, benzaldehyde, phenol and phthalates) polyaromatic hydrocarbons (cyclopentane and cyclohexane naphthenes), nitrogen compounds (ammonia, amines), sulfur compounds (sulphides and mercaptans), greases, calcium chlorides, magnesium chlorides, carboxylic acids, carbonates, cyanides, chromium, lead, arsenic, nickel, zinc, phosphates, esters, ethers, ketones, and aldehydes (Coe, 1952; Ruggles, 1959; Mahendrakaenrd and Viraraghavant, 1996; Juang et al. 1997; Al Zarooni et al. 2006; Wagner et al. 2001; Galil and Wolf, 2001; Shokrollahzadeh et al. 2008; Llop et al. 2009). Due to the large variety of compounds within petroleum refinery wastewater, the organic fraction is typically estimated using bulk parameter such as the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), or total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. BOD is an estimate of the amount of oxygen required to oxidize biodegradable organic materials by a heterogeneous microbial population (Ford et al. 1971). During a BOD test, three distinct biological reactions can occur as outlined in Table 2.2. Tracking the shape of the measured BOD curve also gives insight to how the microbial population is responding to the specific wastewater being tested. Figure 2.1 shows the characteristic BOD curves while Table 2.3 describes each curve. Typically, the BOD is measured after 5 days of incubation and reported as the BOD5 (Eckenfelder, 2000). In industrial wastewater, other compounds that can be

oxidized may also need to be accounted for in the BOD test including sulfides, sulfites and oxidizable nitrogen (Eckenfelder, 2000). COD measures the amount of oxygen it takes to oxidize organic and inorganic substances using potassium dichromate in a sulphuric acid solution (Ford et al. 1971).

Oxidation The following equation outlines the general chemical reaction: COHNS + O2 + bacteria  CO2 + H2O + NH3 + other end products + energy (2.1) A portion of the organic waste compounds are converted into new cell tissue using part of the energy released during the oxidation step. Synthesis The following equation outlines the general chemical reaction: COHNS + O2 + bacteria + energy  C5H7NO2 (2.2) The bacteria consume their own cell tissue to obtain energy for cell maintenance when there are no more available organic waste compounds. Endogenous Respiration The following equation outlines the general chemical reaction: C5H7NO2 + 5O2  5CO2 + NH3 + H2O (2.3)

Table 2.3: Overview of Characteristic BOD Curves (Eckenfelder, 2000) Curve Description BOD curve using activated sludge which is fully acclimatized to the wastewater. A Oxidation and Synthesis are the dominant biological reactions occurring. BOD curve using activated sludge which is slowly acclimatized to the wastewater. B Oxidation and Synthesis are the dominant biological reactions after acclimatization phase is complete. BOD curve using activated sludge which is not acclimatized to the wastewater. C Endogenous Respiration is the dominant biological reaction occurring. BOD curve using wastewater which is inhibitory or toxic to the activated sludge. D No significant biological reactions are occurring.

It should be noted that the COD is usually higher than the BOD when testing refinery wastewater since organic compounds that are oxidized by dichromate may be a mixture of readily biodegradable, slowly biodegradable or recalcitrant compounds (Ford et al. 1971; Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). Inorganic substances such as sulfides, sulfites, thiosulfates, nitrites, and ferrous iron are also oxidized by dichromate (Eckenfelder, 2000).

TOC measures the amount of carbon in a water sample by measuring the carbon dioxide generated from combustion of the water sample (Ford et al. 1971). It should be noted that biodegradable, slowly biodegradable or even recalcitrant compounds cannot be distinguished with the TOC test (Orhon et al. 1999). The TOC test also does not indicate the oxidation state of the compounds in the sample so the result cannot be used as a direct balance between substrate utilized, biomass generated and oxygen consumed (Orhon et al. 1999). Correlations between BOD, COD and TOC are often developed due to the differences in the testing methods and the results generated (Eckenfelder, 2000). A correlation between COD and TOC is outlined in Appendix A. The relationship between the BOD, COD and TOC tests is shown in Figure 2.2. A review of refinery wastewater characterization throughout literature is summarized in Table 2.4 and the complete information is outlined in Appendix B.

Due to the various compounds in refinery wastewater, the effluent must meet a specific quality standard before it can be discharged to the environment as regulated by both the Canadian federal and provincial governments.

2.2 CURRENT CANADIAN REGULATIONS FOR REFINERY LIQUID EFFLUENTS The Canadian federal and provincial governments are enabled by the Canadian Fisheries Act to have the authority to regulate effluent water pollution from petroleum refineries. These regulations are outlined in Table 2.5.

These regulations also include the government recommended wastewater treatment technology for Canadian petroleum refineries. Table 2.6. The specific technologies are outlined in

Table 2.6 shows that petroleum refinery wastewater is often treated by a series of physical, chemical and biological treatment technologies. A typical petroleum refinery WWTP flow diagram is shown in Figure 2.3.

The two main goals of Ontario's Municipal Industrial Strategy for Abatement (MISA) regulations was to create a comprehensive pollution control program to reduce all municipal and industrial waste loadings, and to virtually eliminate the discharge of toxic contaminants to Ontario's waterways (Ontario, 1988). MISA is a command-and-control policy where a permit is issued by the provincial government to each industrial facility that discharges liquid effluent to a body of surface water (MacDonald and Lintner, 2010). MISA is also a technology-based standard (TBS) since each permit is based on pollution control technologies for a specific industry (Dupuy, 1997). It should be noted that all six of Ontario's refineries upgraded their WWTP's to the recommended pollution control technology in order to comply with the MISA regulations (MacDonald and Lintner, 2010). Therefore, all six of Ontario's refineries should be consistently meeting their respective effluent limits. Figure 2.4 shows the average monthly effluent TOC mass loadings from 2008 through 2011 for all six of Ontario's petroleum refinery's (Ontario, 2013). The raw data is outlined in Appendix C. The average monthly effluent TOC mass loadings for all six of Ontario's petroleum refineries have always been below the regulated limits of 167 kg/day for IOL Nanticoke, 859 kg/day for IOL Sarnia, 256 kg/day for Nova Corunna, 214 kg/day for Shell Sarnia, 220 kg/day for Suncor Mississauga and 214 kg/day for Suncor Sarnia (Ontario, 1993; Ontario, 2013). When a regulation is in the process of being amended, it must also clearly align with other current regulations as well as emerging regulations. In the case of a TBS like the MISA regulations, one such regulation that needs to be considered is Ontario Regulation 455/09 the Toxics Reduction Act (TRA).

12

Figure 2.4: Ontario Petroleum Refineries Average Effluent TOC Mass Loading from 2008 through 2011

13

The main purpose of the TRA is to prevent pollution and protect human health and the environment by reducing the use and creation of toxic substances (Ontario, 2009a). The TRA regulation lists 47 compounds with multiple sub-compounds that need to be considered when reviewing a TBS like the MISA regulations (Ontario 2009b). Future regulations must also now consider the use and creation of toxic substances when using new technology.

2.3 BIOLOGICAL WASTEWATER TECHNOLOGY FOR A REFINERY WWTP Biological treatment by an activated sludge process is an established practice used to treat refinery wastewater since it is usually the most economical method for reducing both wastewater toxicity and dissolved organic constituents (Qin et al. 2007). Activated sludge processes are classified as either suspended growth or supported growth systems and can operate under aerobic or anaerobic conditions (Tyagi et al. 1992, Rebhun and Galil, 1988). A review of biological treatment technology for petroleum refinery wastewater throughout literature is summarized in Table 2.7 and the complete information is outlined in Appendix D.

Table 2.7: Biological Technology for Petroleum Refinery Wastewater Treatment
PARAMETER Hydraulic Retention Time (hr) Temperature (°C) pH BOD (mg/L) COD (mg/L) Phenol (mg/L) TSS (mg/L) Ammonia (mg/L) Oil & Grease (mg/L) RANGE 0.3 ­ 240.0 15 ­ 40 2.5 ­10.4 69 ­ 3,160 220 ­ 142,000 9 ­ 100 5 ­ 900 4.7 ­ 24.0 2 ­ 90

Refinery wastewater often contains a high concentration of compounds that could be toxic to or inhibit the microorganisms in the biological treatment unit (Juang et al, 1997). A
14

sudden load of high strength, non-biodegradable or toxic wastewater can lead to a WWTP discharging effluent that exceeds regulatory limits or even result in the failure of the biological treatment unit. This would require long periods of time to re-establish a reliable activated sludge which can impact the throughput of upstream refinery production units (Tyagi et al. 1992; Chavan and Mukherji, 2008). Therefore, additional advanced treatment technology may be required to degrade these types of compounds. One promising area of research is advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).

2.4 ADVANCED OXIDATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY FOR A REFINERY WWTP Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a type of advanced technology which are effective at treating wastewaters that contains non-biodegradable, inhibitory, or toxic compounds (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). The main advantage of AOPs is that the organic compounds in the wastewater could be completely converted to water and carbon dioxide without generating a residual solid waste by-product (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). An important disadvantage of AOPs is that the capital and operating costs are usually much higher when compared to conventional biological treatment processes (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). Therefore, AOPs are typically used as either a pre-treatment to enhance the biodegradability of the wastewater before the biological treatment process or as a post-treatment after the biological treatment process to remove any remaining compounds that were not degraded (Juang et al. 1997; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). Some examples of AOPs include UV, UV/H2O2, UV/O3, UV/H2O2/O3, and UV/TiO2 (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). A review of AOP treatment technology for petroleum refinery wastewater throughout the literature is summarized in Table 2.8 and the complete information is outlined in Appendix E.

Table 2.8: Overview of Chemical Wastewater Treatment Technology for Petroleum Refinery Wastewater
PARAMETER Time (hr) Temperature (°C) pH COD (mg/L) TOC (mg/L) Phenol (mg/L) RANGE 0.25 ­ 12.00 20 ­ 50 2.1 ­11.0 96 ­5,500 133 ­1,200 38 ­ 80

AOPs use an oxidant (H2O2, O3, etc.) and energy or a catalyst to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH) which are able to oxidize almost all organic pollutants (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may generate hydroxyl radicals in the presence of UV light with the wavelength of less than 254 nm based on Equation 2.4 (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004): H2O2 + hv  2(OH)

(2.4)

These hydroxyl radicals are able to degrade pollutants by addition to double bonds, abstraction of a hydrogen atom, or transferring an electron to a compound according to Equations 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004):


Addition Hydrogen Abstraction Electron Transfer

OH + X2C=CX2  X2C(OH)-CX2
 

(2.5) (2.6) (2.7)

OH + RH  H2O + R

OH + RX  -OH + XR+

The products of degrading organic molecules could be intermediate molecules or final stage compounds such as HCO3-, Cl-, NO3-, CO2, or H2O (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). AOPs are able to completely degrade organic compounds in water without transferring them to another

medium or generating a secondary waste that requires additional disposal (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). Hydroxyl radicals non-selectively oxidize organic compounds so AOPs are effective at treating recalcitrant, inhibitory and toxic compounds (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). degradation types are outlined in Table 2.9. The

The molecular structure of the parent compound changes in a way which increases the toxicity of the compound or decreases the biodegradability of the compound. The organic compound is completely degraded into the final products of carbon dioxide and water.

Improper Complete Mineralization

One of the issues with AOPs is that the hydroxyl radical can be consumed by reacting with inorganic constituents in wastewater including bicarbonates, carbonates, phosphates, reduced cations such as iron and excessive amounts of hydrogen peroxide (Hernandez et al. 2002; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). These "scavenging reactions" can significantly reduce the efficiency of an AOP to oxidize the target constituents and are outlined in Equations 2.8 through 2.11 (Andreozzi et al. 1999; Hernandez et al. 2002).

(2.8) (2.9) (2.10) (2.11)

Wastewater with high alkalinity must have the pH adjusted before treatment with an AOP to minimize these scavenging reactions (Juang et al. 1997; Andreozzi et al. 1999). Juang et al.

17

(1997) found that when the pH of the petrochemical wastewater was kept at 8.5, there was a large H2O2 consumption with very little COD or TOC removal. When the pH was adjusted down to 3, the carbonate and bicarbonate molecules formed carbonic acid which is not a hydroxide radical scavenger and the COD and TOC removal significantly increased to 69.9% and 55.5% respectively. It was also found that a high concentration of hydrogen ions at a low pH also scavenges hydroxyl radicals as indicated by decreasing treatment performance at lower pH's (Juang et al. 1997). Andreozzi et al. (1999) also mentioned that a pH between 3 and 5 typically results in the highest efficiency of constituent destruction. Water can be resistant to pH changes due to buffering related to the dissolved inorganic carbon species of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions (Chapra, 2008). Carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid which the dissociates into its ionic form as shown in equation 2.12 with an equilibrium constant shown in equation 2.13 (Chapra, 2008): (2.12)

(2.13)

The bicarbonate ion the dissociates to a carbonate ion as shown in equation 2.14 with an equilibrium constant shown in equation 2.15 (Chapra, 2008): (2.14)

(2.15)

The fraction of the three inorganic carbon species can be calculated according to equations 2.16, 2.17, and 2.18 (Chapra, 2008):

Assuming the initial temperature of the water was 20°C, the equilibrium constants would be (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003):

The calculated fractionation of the three inorganic carbon species is outlined in Table 2.10. The data in Table 2.10 is displayed in Figure 2.5.

There are a number of examples in the literature showing that AOPs are effective at treating industrial wastewater. Niegowski (1956) used ozone to treat refinery wastewater

containing phenols. Farooq and Misbahuddin (1991b) treated wastewater through a combination of activated carbon adsorption and ozonation. Juang et al. (1997) used a laboratory scale UV/H2O2 system to treat petrochemical wastewater as pre-treatment or post-treatment for a refinery WWTP biological treatment unit. Adeyinka and Rim-Rukeh (1999) treated effluent from a petrochemical plant in bench scale tests with alum and hydrogen peroxide. Huang et al. (1999) treated the effluent from a refinery WWTP biological treatment unit using various chemical oxidants including O3, O3/H2O2, sodium hypochlorite, and Fenton's reagent. Andereozzi et al. (2000) used combinations of AOPs (O3/UV, O3/H2O2) to treat mineral oil contaminated wastewater at ambient conditions as well as developing a kinetic model for both O3/UV and O3/H2O2 systems.

Lin et al. (2001) treated petrochemical wastewater in a laboratory scale test that combined preozonation and a lifted moving-bed biological activated carbon process. Wagner and Nicell (2001) treated refinery wastewater containing phenols using horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. Stepnowski et al. (2002) treated refinery wastewater with UV/H2O2 as a pretreatment to the refinery WWTP biological treatment unit and found that additional UV irradiation only slightly increased the degradation process. Mohammadzadeh et al. (2004)

treated phenol-rich olefin plant wastewater using O3 in a bench scale semi-batch system and a pilot scale unit. Chidambara and Quen (2005) optimized a UV/H2O2 process that was integrated with a biological treatment unit using Taguchi's orthogonal design and found that a single dose of H2O2 was more effective than several smaller doses, the circulation rate was insignificant and the molar ratio between H2O2 used per TOC degradation was 1:1 for pre-treatment and 4:1 for post-treatment. Saien and Nejati (2007) treated refinery wastewater containing aliphatic and aromatic compounds using a circulating photocatalytic reactor with TiO2 catalyst. Ting et al. (2007) treated the effluent from a refinery WWTP biological treatment unit with a batch scale and pilot scale electro-Fenton process. Sun et al. (2008) used microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation at low temperature and pressure to treat refinery wastewater. While the literature does show that AOPs are effective at treating industrial wastewater, there are very few examples of treating actual petroleum refinery wastewater, none of this literature is from Canada, and none of this literature uses respirometry to assess the effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process (Niegowski, 1956; Juang et al. 1997; Adeyinka and Rim-Rukeh 1999; Huang et al. 1999; Andereozzi et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2001; Wagner and

(1997) and Stepnowski et al. (2002) since both of these works also used a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater. However, this research is still significantly different from these other studies. Juang et al. (1997) and Stepanowskil et al. (2002) used actual wastewater from a petroleum refinery in Taiwan and Poland respectively, whereas this research used wastewater from a petroleum refinery in Canada. Stepnowski et al. (2002) also examined the degradation of specific compounds where as this research examined the degradation of all soluble organic carbon species as measured by the total organic carbon (TOC). This research is also significantly different since respirometry was used to assess the effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process.

CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS

3.1 MATERIALS 3.1.1 Petroleum Refinery Wastewater and Activated Sludge Samples Wastewater and activated sludge samples were collected from the Suncor Mississauga refinery WWTP. The Suncor Mississauga refinery has a combined sewer system where all of the clean water, oily water and process wastewater sources all combine into a single influent wastewater stream for the WWTP. The combined influent wastewater first passes through an American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity separator in order to remove free oil and solid particles. The wastewater then is pumped to an equalization tank to minimize fluctuations in wastewater temperature and contaminant concentrations. The wastewater then passes through dissolved air flotation (DAF) units to remove emulsified oil and solid particles. The wastewater is then treated in the activated sludge biological treatment units. Batch wastewater samples were collected from a sample point between the DAF units and the biological treatment units. Operations staff at the Suncor Mississauga refinery WWTP collect samples from this location twice a day to monitor the water quality entering the biological treatment units. Operations staff at the Suncor Mississauga refinery WWTP do not collect composite samples since the upstream equalization tank minimizes any wastewater temperature

24

or contaminant concentration fluctuations. The batch samples collected accurately reflect the water quality entering the biological treatment units throughout the 12 hours between samples. Table 3.1 outlines the typical contaminant concentrations for the influent wastewater to the biological treatment units. Activated sludge samples were collected from the Suncor Mississauga refinery WWTP biological treatment unit since the microorganisms would already be acclimatized to the influent wastewater.

3.1.2 Chemicals A 30% w/w solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with a density of 1,110 g/L was used as the chemical oxidant in the UV/ H2O2 process. A 1N solution of sulphuric acid and a 50% solution of sodium hydroxide were used to adjust the pH in the UV/H2O2 process. Distilled Toronto municipal city water was used in the respirometric experiments.

3.2 EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY SETUP The refinery wastewater was placed in a bench scale cylindrical glass reactor vessel that was 5.0 inches tall and had a diameter of 2.5 inches as shown in Figure 3.1. The reactor was
25

placed on a VWR Stir Plate Model 365 with a magnetic stir bar to ensure that the water and chemicals were well mixed. The UV light was generated using a Philips PL-S9W/TUV UV-C 9 WATT lamp. The reactor was also covered in aluminum foil to ensure the UV energy is contained inside the reactor.

Figure 3.1: Laboratory Set-up of UV/H2O2 Process

3.3 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES 3.3.1 Experimental Procedure 250 mL of raw petroleum refinery wastewater was first added to a bench scale reactor. The stir plate was then turned on. The pH of the petroleum refinery wastewater was measured using a Thermo Orion Model 230A+ pH meter. This instrument has a pH resolution of 0.01 and a pH accuracy of ±0.02. The pH meter was calibrated using a pH 4.01, 7.00 and 10.00 buffer

26

solution at a room temperature of approximately 20°C. Sulphuric acid was then added to adjust the pH from the initial 7.5 down to a minimum of 4.0. H2O2 was then added as the chemical oxidant where the concentration varied from an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7-8.6 mol H2O2/mol C. The UV lamp was then placed on top of the reactor submerging the UV bulb directly into the reactor contents. The treatment time varied from 10 to 45 min to assess the effect of reaction time on the TOC removal. The temperature of the wastewater was not controlled during the experiments. This is due to the fact that the treatment kinetics were not evaluated as part of this study. The wastewater treatment began at the ambient temperature of the lab which was approximately 20°C. Throughout the treatment, the temperature of the wastewater would have increased due to the heat generated from the UV bulb. It can be assumed that the degradation rate of the contaminants would increase as the temperature increases (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). The final temperature was not recorded since this study focused on the final TOC concentration achieved from treatment using a UV/H2O2 process, not the treatment kinetics of the process. As shown in Appendix E, Juang et. al. (1997) controlled the temperature of the reaction at 30°C and Stepnowski et. al. (2002) did not even mention the process temperature. After the specified reaction time, the UV lamp was turned off, the mixer was turned off and the treated wastewater was sampled for total organic carbon (TOC) testing. Sodium hydroxide was added to UV/H2O2 treated water to adjust the pH back up to 7.0 for specific respirometry tests. The TOC concentration of the sample was measured using a

Teledyne Tekmar Apollo 9000 Combustion TOC/TN Analyzer equipped with an automated sampler. The TOC was tested in triplicate for each sample.

27

3.3.2 Experimental Design There were two phases to the bench scale experiments. The first phase was an initial screening of how the reaction time, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio, and the system pH affected the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater using a UV/H2O2 process. The second phase used the results of the first phase to further improve the UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater. A 23 factorial design with a center point run was used in the first phase or the screening phase of the experiments. A 23 factorial design means that all three parameters are tested at their lower and upper values. The three parameters are the reaction time, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio, and the system pH as indicated in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2: 23 Factorial Design Input Data for the Initial Experimental Testing of a UV/H2O2 Process to Treat Petroleum Refinery Wastewater Parameter Reaction Time (min) Initial H2O2 / TOC Molar Ratio (mol H2O2/mol C) pH Lower Value 10 2.9 4.0 Middle Value 20 5.8 6.0 Upper Value 30 8.6 7.5

The center point run took place at the middle values where the reaction time was 20 min, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio was 5.8, and the system pH was 6.0. 23 or eight distinct tests were completed since three parameters are being tested at the lower and upper values. An additional test at the center point was completed which equals a total of nine tests for the first phase of experiments. The experimental parameters which resulted in the highest TOC removal were used as the basis for the second phase of testing.

28

The second phase of testing used a 33 factorial design where the basis used was the highest performance result from the first phase of testing. A 33 factorial design means that all three parameters will be tested at their lower, middle and upper values. The three parameters are once again the reaction time, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio, and the system pH as indicated in Table 3.3. 33 or 27 distinct tests will be completed since three parameters are being tested at the lower, middle and upper values.

Each experiment was replicated three separate times in order to determine the average and standard deviation of the wastewater TOC. The methods to calculate the average and standard deviation are outlined in Appendix F and G.

3.3.3. Respirometry Testing The effects of adding raw and UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process were tested using a Bioscience BI-2000 Electrolytic Respirometer. Half of the 1 L respirometer reactors were seeded with activated sludge resulting in an initial mixed liquor volatile suspended solids concentration of 1,000 mg VSS/L. The other half of the respirometer reactors did not contain any activated sludge since they acted as an abiotic control. The abiotic reactors were
29

used to assess the background oxygen consumption. The respirometer reactors, either seeded or not seeded, were then filled with either municipal tap water, untreated refinery wastewater or refinery wastewater treated by a UV/H2O2 process. The pH of the UV/H2O2 treated wastewater was either left at 5.0 or it was increased back to 7.0 to assess if there were any pH impacts to the activated sludge microorganisms in the reactor. In summary, eight different experimental

combinations were tested using the respirometers as shown in Table 3.4.

It should be also noted that each experiment was replicated three separate times in order to determine the average and standard deviation of the wastewater TOC as outlined in Appendix F and G.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 INITIAL EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF A UV/H2O2 PROCESS TO TREAT PETROLEUM REFINERY WASTEWATER The first phase of experiments was an initial screening of how the reaction time, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio and the system pH affected the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater using a UV/H2O2 process. A 23 factorial design with a center point run at a reaction time of 20 min, an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 5.8 mol H2O2/mol C, and a pH of 6.0 was used as outlined in Table 3.2. Figure 4.1 shows the TOC removal results from the experimental testing outlined in Table 3.2. As stated previously in Section 3.3.2, a total of nine tests were completed. Four of the tests took place at a pH of 4.0 where the lower and upper reaction times and initial H2O2/TOC molar ratios were tested. Four of the tests took place at an initial pH of 7.5 where the lower and upper reaction times and initial H2O2/TOC molar ratios were tested. The final test took place at the center point at the middle values where the reaction time was 20 min, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio was 5.8, and the system pH was 6.0. This is why Figure 4.1 has four bars at a pH of 4.0, four bars at a pH of 7.5 and only one bar at a pH of 6.0. It should also be noted that the average initial TOC was 42.0 mg C/L for all experiments. The initial H2O2 concentration for the experiments were 345, 690 and 1,023 mg H2O2/L for an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.9, 5.8, and 8.6 mol H2O2/mol C respectively.

A detailed outline of each experimental run is in Appendix H. The measured TOC concentration data output from the TOC analyzer is presented in Appendix I. Figure 4.1 shows that a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater is significantly more effective at reducing the TOC when the pH is lowered and the reaction time is increased. This confirms the work previously completed by Juang et al. (1997) and Stepnowski et al. (2002) as discussed in Section 2.4. When the pH was kept at the initial value of 7.5, the resulting TOC reduction was less than 20% when the reaction time was either 10 or 30 min or when the H2O2/TOC molar ratio was 2.9 or 8.6 mol H2O2/mol C. When the pH was reduced to 4.0, the TOC reduction significantly increased to approximately 30% and 55% when the reaction time was 10 and 30 min, respectively. A three factor ANOVA analysis was also completed to identify which parameters and parameter interactions had a significant effect in the initial experimental results. Table 4.1 summarizes the results of a three factor ANOVA analysis while Figure 4.2 and 4.3 display the main effects and interaction effects plots respectively. The center point result was not included to maintain a balanced ANOVA analysis.

35

The three factor ANOVA analysis confirms that a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater was significantly more effective at reducing the TOC when the pH is lowered and the reaction time is increased. Adjusting the pH was significant since the F-ratio of 540.801 was higher than the critical F-ratio of 8.531 at F0.01,1,16. Adjusting the reaction time was also

significant since the F-ratio of 123.454 was higher than the critical F-ratio of 8.531 at F0.01,1,16. Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 both show that the treatment performance increases when the pH is lowered and the reaction time is increased. The interaction between the pH and the reaction time is also significant since the F-ratio of 23.368 was higher than the critical F-ratio of 8.531 at F0.01,1,16. Adjusting the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio was not significant since the F-ratio of 1.620 was lower than the critical F-ratio of 8.531 at F0.01,1,16. Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 both show that the treatment performance does not significantly change when the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio is adjusted. All of the other interactions between the reaction time, initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio and pH were also not significant since the F-ratio's were lower than the corresponding critical F-ratio's. Lowering the pH consumed alkalinity in the wastewater which minimizes hydroxyl radical scavenging reactions as previously described in Section 2.4. Minimizing hydroxyl

radical scavenging reactions results in a higher UV/H2O2 process treatment performance. Table 2.1 shows that one of the main sources of water to a refinery WWTP is clean water sources including cooling water, boiler blow down, and storm water. All three of these sources contain some form of alkalinity. The refinery, where the wastewater and activated sludge were collected from, measures the alkalinity of the influent wastewater to the biological treatment units on a daily basis using Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater Method #2320B (American, 1999) in order to monitor nitrification in the biological treatment units.

36

When the wastewater samples were collected from the refinery WWTP, the refinery measured the alkalinity as 142 mg/L measured as CaCO3. This measurement is similar to the results found by McKinney R.E. (1967) who found that the average alkalinity in a number of refinery WWTP's was 180 mg/L measured as CaCO3. As previously described in Section 2.4, carbonate and bicarbonate ions scavenge hydroxyl radicals and decrease the performance of a UV/H2O2 process while carbonic acid does not scavenge hydroxyl radicals (Juang et al. 1997). As Table 2.10 shows, theoretically 92.9% of the inorganic carbon ions are hydroxyl radical scavengers which explain the very low treatment performance at the initial wastewater with the pH of 7.5. When the pH was reduced from 7.5 to 6.0, the theoretically concentration of hydroxyl radical scavengers was reduced by approximately a factor of 3.2 from 92.9% to 29.4% and resulted in a higher treatment performance. When the pH was further reduced to 4.0, the theoretically concentration of hydroxyl radical scavengers was reduced by approximately a factor of 221.3 from 92.9% to 0.4% and resulted in an even higher treatment performance. There may be also other compounds present in the refinery wastewater which could scavenge hydroxyl radicals and decrease the performance of a UV/H2O2 process including chlorides and various weak acids. It is recommended to further investigate the composition of refinery wastewater to identify other compounds that would scavenge hydroxyl radicals and affect the performance of a UV/H2O2 process. Overall, a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater is significantly more effective at reducing the TOC in the wastewater when the pH is decreased from 7.5 to 4.0 and the reaction time is increased from 10 to 30 min. This result confirms the work previously

37

completed by Juang et al. (1997) and Stepnowski et al. (2002) as discussed in Section 2.4. Decreasing the pH consumes alkalinity in the wastewater which minimizes hydroxyl radical scavenging reactions and results in a higher UV/H2O2 process treatment performance. Increasing the reaction time allows for more time for the reaction to take place which also results in a higher UV/H2O2 process treatment performance (Scott and Ollis, 1995). As mentioned previously in section 3.3.2, the basis for the second phase of experimental testing used the best performance result from the initial experimental testing. Lowering the pH to 4.0 and increasing the reaction time to 30 min significantly increased the TOC reduction as indicated from the three factor ANOVA analysis. Therefore, the best treatment performance took place at a reaction time of 30 minutes and a pH of 4.0. There was no significant difference in TOC reduction if the experiment took place at an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of either 2.9 or 8.6 mol H2O2/mol C as indicated from the three factor ANOVA analysis. The lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.9 mol H2O2/mol C was chosen as the best performance since a lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio means less H2O2 was being used in the treatment process. Using less H2O2 in the treatment process would reduce the cost of the UV/H2O2 process. Therefore, the best performance for the initial experimental testing was chosen at a reaction time of 30 min, an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.9 mol H2O2/mol C, and a pH of 4.0.

4.2 ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL TESTING TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF A UV/H2O2 PROCESS TO TREAT PETROLEUM REFINERY WASTEWATER A second phase of experiments was performed to improve the performance of a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater. As mentioned previously, the basis for the second phase of experimental testing used the best performance result from the initial
38

experimental testing where the reaction time was 30 min, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio was 2.9 mol H2O2/mol C, and the pH was 4.0. A reaction time of 30 min would be the basis so the lower and higher values were set at ±50% of the base value which means the experimental reaction times would be 15, 30, and 45 min. An initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.8 mol H2O2/mol C would be the basis so the lower and higher values were set at ±40% of the base value which means the experimental initial H2O2/TOC molar ratios would be 1.7, 2.8, and 3.9 mol H2O2/mol C. A ±40% was selected based on the ability to accurately measure and add the required amount H2O2 to meet the required initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio. The minimum pH was established at 4.0 since that was the lowest calibrated value on the pH meter. The middle and higher values were set at one standard unit higher at a pH of 5.0 and 6.0 respectively. A 33 factorial design was used in the second phase of experiments as outlined in Table 3.3. Figure 4.4 shows the TOC removal results from the experimental testing outlined in Table 3.3. It should also be noted that the average initial TOC was 42.7 mg C/L for all experiments. The initial H2O2 concentration for the experiments were 202, 333 and 464 mg H2O2/L for an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7, 2.8, and 3.9 mol H2O2/mol C respectively. A detailed outline of each experimental run is in Appendix J. The measured TOC concentration data output from the TOC analyzer is presented in Appendix K. Figure 4.4 shows that the average TOC removal was 51, 68 and 74% at a reaction time of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. The treatment at a wastewater pH of 5.0 was also on average 6% higher compared to treatment at a wastewater pH of 4.0 or 6.0 for the same reaction time and initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio. This observation aligns with the literature since it has been found that the highest treatment performance of an AOP typically occurs at a pH between 3.0 and 5.0 (Andreozzi et al. 1999).

A three factor ANOVA analysis was also completed to identify which parameters and parameter interactions had a significant effect in the additional experimental results. Table 4.2 summarizes the results of a three factor ANOVA analysis while Figure 4.4 and 4.5 display the main effects and interaction effects plots.

The three factor ANOVA analysis confirmed again that a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater was significantly more effective at reducing the TOC when the pH is lowered and the reaction time was increased. Adjusting the reaction time was significant since the F-ratio of 74.944 was higher than the critical F-ratio of 5.021 at F0.01,2,54. Adjusting the pH was also significant since the F-ratio of 6.525 was higher than the critical F-ratio of 5.021 at F0.01,2,54. Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 both show that the treatment performance increases when the reaction time is increased. Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 also both show that the treatment

performance increases when the pH is reduced from 6.0 to 5.0, but then the treatment performance decreases when the pH is further reduced from 5.0 to 4.0. Once again, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio was not significant since the F-ratio of 0.606 was lower than the critical F-ratio of 5.021 at F0.01,2,54. Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5 both show that the treatment performance does not significantly change when the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio is adjusted.

All of the other interactions between the reaction time, initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio and pH were also not significant since the F-ratio's were lower than the corresponding critical F-ratio's. Therefore, the best treatment performance took place at a reaction time of 45 minutes and a pH of 5.0. There was no significant difference in TOC reduction if the experiment took place at an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of either 1.7, 2.8 or 3.9 mol H2O2/mol C as indicated from the three factor ANOVA analysis. The lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C was chosen as the best performance since a lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio would result in less H2O2 being used. Using less H2O2 in the process would reduce the cost of the UV/H2O2 process. Therefore, the best performance was chosen at a reaction time of 45 min, an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C, and a pH of 5.0. These parameters will be used in assessing the effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process. As previously described in Section 2.4, carbonate and bicarbonate ions scavenge hydroxyl radicals and decrease the performance of a UV/H2O2 process while carbonic acid does not scavenge hydroxyl radicals (Juang et al. 1997). As Table 2.10 shows, theoretically 29.42% of the inorganic carbon ions are hydroxyl radical scavengers at a pH of 6.0. When the pH was reduced to 5.0, the theoretically concentration of hydroxyl radical scavengers was reduced by approximately a factor of 7.4 from 29.4% to 4.0%. When the pH was further reduced to 4.0, the theoretically concentration of hydroxyl radical scavengers was reduced by approximately a factor of 70.1 from 29.4% to 0.4%. As previously mentioned, there may also be other compounds present in the refinery wastewater which could scavenge hydroxyl radicals and decrease the performance of a UV/H2O2 process including chlorides and various weak acids. It is recommended to further investigate the
44

composition of refinery wastewater to identify other compounds that would scavenge hydroxyl radicals and affect the performance of a UV/H2O2 process. The TOC removal performance may start to decrease below a pH of 5 since a high concentration of hydrogen ions consumes hydrogen peroxide without generating hydroxyl radicals (Juang et al. 1997). Decreasing the wastewater pH from 5.0 to 4.0 increases the concentration of hydrogen ions in the wastewater. Therefore, lowering the pH from 5.0 to 4.0 may increase the concentration of hydrogen ions which consumes hydrogen peroxide beyond any benefit gained from further decreasing the concentration of bicarbonate ions which scavenges hydroxyl radicals (Juang et al. 1997). It is recommended to further examine why the treatment performance of a UV/H2O2 process may start to decrease as the pH continues to decrease by measuring the initial and final concentrations of TOC, pH, alkalinity and residual H2O2. Once again, increasing the reaction time also allows for more time for the reaction to take place which also results in a higher UV/H2O2 process treatment performance (Scott and Ollis, 1995).

4.3 ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF ADDING UV/H2O2 TREATED PETROLEUM REFINERY WASTEWATER TO REFINERY WWTP ACTIVATED SLUDGE The other objective of this work was to assess the effects of adding UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater to activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP biological treatment process. The effects of UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater will be assessed as the amount of oxygen consumed by the activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP using respirometry. The petroleum refinery wastewater was treated using the

45

best treatment performance parameters of 45 min reaction time, an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C and a pH of 5.0. Figure 4.7 outlines the measured oxygen demand results from the respirometry experiments. Table 4.3 summarizes the respirometry experimental results. Figure 4.8 displays the results from Table 4.3. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 show that the untreated refinery wastewater was very biodegradable by the activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP. The average initial TOC of the untreated refinery wastewater was 42.4 mg C/L. As outlined in Appendix A, an initial TOC of 42.4 mg C/L would have an estimated COD of 112.9 mg O2/L using a COD/TOC ratio of 2.67 mg O2/ mg C. This estimated COD is similar to the measured oxygen demand of 117.0±11.8 mg O2/L. These experiments were the biotic control since activated sludge was added to the respirometry reactors. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the untreated refinery wastewater without activated sludge added had a measured oxygen demand of 29.8±4.2 mg O2/L. These

experiments were the abiotic control since activated sludge was not added to the respirometry reactors. Therefore, this oxygen demand would most likely correspond to the presence of reducing compounds in the wastewater such as sulphides and also the leak rate of the respirometry equipment. The refinery, where the wastewater and activated sludge were collected from, measures the sulphide concentration of the influent wastewater on a daily basis using the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater Method #4500S (American, 1999). The sulphide concentration of the influent wastewater was 9.6 mg S/L on the day the samples were collected which corresponds to an estimated COD of 19.2 mg O2/L as calculated in Appendix L.

Therefore, the remaining 9.6 mg O2/L of the background oxygen demand would be made up of oxygen leaking into the respirometry equipment through joint connections and any other reducing compounds that may be present in the wastewater. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the calculated BOD5 for the untreated refinery wastewater was 87.2 mg O2/L. The BOD5 was calculated by subtracting the background oxygen demand of 29.8 mg O2/L from the measured oxygen demand of 117.0 mg O2/L. The

BOD5/COD ratio was also 77.2% which indicates a majority of the organics in the wastewater are easily degraded by the activated sludge microorganisms. The estimated COD of 112.9 mg O2/L also resulted in an initial food to microorganism (F/M) ratio of approximately 0.113 kg COD/kg VSS, as calculated in Appendix M. This F/M ratio aligns with respirometry tests found throughout literature (Orhon et al. 1999; Strotmann et al. 1999) and a typical biological treatment system (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). Figure 4.7 also shows that an A type BOD curve was produced as displayed in Figure 2.1. Overall, the untreated refinery wastewater was very biodegradable by the activated sludge from the refinery WWTP. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 show that the refinery WWTP activated sludge microorganisms were also viable and active. The average initial TOC of the municipal tap water was 2.1 mg C/L which resulted in an estimated COD of 5.5 mg O2/L as calculated in Appendix A. This estimated COD was much lower than the measured oxygen demand of 55.8±7.5 mg O2/L. These experiments were the biotic control since activated sludge was added to the respirometry reactors. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the municipal tap water without activated sludge added had a measured oxygen demand of 9.4±2.3 mg O2/L. These experiments were the abiotic control since activated sludge was not added to the respirometry reactors. Therefore, this oxygen

50

demand would most likely correspond to the leak rate of the respirometry equipment. This leak rate was very similar to the previously calculated 9.6 mg O2/L for the background oxygen demand which was made up of equipment leaks and any other reducing compounds that may be present in the wastewater. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the calculated BOD5 for the municipal tap water was 46.4 mg O2/L. The BOD5 was calculated by subtracting the background oxygen demand of 9.4 mg O2/L from the measured oxygen demand of 55.8 mg O2/L. The estimated COD of 5.5 mg O2/L also resulted in an initial F/M ratio of approximately 0.006 kg COD/kg VSS, as calculated in Appendix M which would result in a higher rate of endogenous respiration (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). Figure 4.7 also shows that a C type BOD curve was produced as displayed in Figure 2.1. Table 2.2 shows that endogenous respiration requires more oxygen relative to typical oxidation and synthesis biological reactions which explains why the measured oxygen demand was much higher compared to the estimated COD. Overall, the refinery WWTP activated sludge microorganisms were viable and active due to endogenous respiration. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 show that the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process inhibited the refinery WWTP activated sludge microorganisms. The average initial TOC of the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process was 9.9 mg C/L which indicates that there were still organic compounds left in the treated wastewater so complete mineralization of the organics did not occur. The average initial TOC also results in an estimated COD of 26.4 mg O2/L as calculated in Appendix A. This estimated COD was similar to the measured oxygen demand of 29.9±5.0 mg O2/L. These experiments were the biotic control since activated sludge was added to the respirometry reactors.

51

Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process without activated sludge added had a measured oxygen demand of 20.6±4.8 mg O2/L. These experiments were the abiotic control since activated sludge was not added to the respirometry reactors. Therefore, this oxygen demand would most likely correspond to the presence of reducing compounds in the wastewater and also the leak rate of the respirometry equipment. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the calculated BOD5 for the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process was 9.3 mg O2/L. The BOD5 was calculated by subtracting the background oxygen demand of 20.6 mg O2/L from the measured oxygen demand of 29.9 mg O2/L. The BOD5/COD ratio was also 35.2% which indicates a majority of the organics in the wastewater were not degradable by the activated sludge microorganisms. This BOD5 was also much lower compared to the BOD5 for the activated sludge treating either untreated petroleum refinery wastewater or municipal tap water. The estimated COD of 26.4 mg O2/L also resulted in an initial F/M ratio of approximately 0.026 kg COD/kg VSS, as calculated in Appendix M. This F/M ratio was below typical biological treatment guidelines and should have resulted in a higher rate of endogenous respiration (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). A B type BOD curve was expected where the residual organic compounds were degraded through oxidation and synthesis biological reactions after which endogenous respiration would take place and result in an increased oxygen consumption. However, endogenous respiration did not occur since Figure 4.7 shows that a D type BOD curve was produced which indicates that the wastewater was inhibitory or toxic to the activated sludge microorganisms. The UV/H2O2 treated refinery wastewater had a pH of 5.0 which was below the optimum pH for bacteria growth typically between 6.5 and 7.5 (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003).

52

Therefore, another set of respirometry experiments were completed where the pH of the UV/H2O2 treated refinery wastewater was increased to 7.0 before being added to the respirometer reactor to assess if the pH of the wastewater was affecting the activated sludge microorganisms. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 show that the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process and then had the pH increased to 7.0 before being added to the respirometer reactors also inhibited the refinery WWTP activated sludge microorganisms. The average initial TOC of the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process and then had the pH increased to 7.0 before being added to the respirometer reactors was 9.9 mg C/L which indicates that there were still organic compounds left in the treated wastewater so complete mineralization of the organics did not occur. The average initial TOC also results in an estimated COD of 26.4 mg O2/L as calculated in Appendix A. This estimated COD was similar to the measured oxygen demand of 33.1±6.7 mg O2/L. These experiments were the biotic control since activated sludge was added to the respirometry reactors. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process and then had the pH increased to 7.0 before being added to the respirometer reactors without activated sludge had a measured oxygen demand of 24.3±6.6 mg O2/L. These experiments were the abiotic control since activated sludge was not added to the respirometry reactors. Therefore, this oxygen demand would most likely correspond to the presence of reducing compounds in the wastewater and also the leak rate of the respirometry equipment. Figure 4.8 and Table 4.3 also show that the calculated BOD5 for the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process and then had the pH increased to 7.0 before being added to the respirometer reactors was 8.8 mg O2/L. The BOD5 was calculated by subtracting

53

the background oxygen demand of 24.3 mg O2/L from the measured oxygen demand of 33.1 mg O2/L. This shows that the BOD5 did not improve when the pH was adjusted from 5.0 to 7.0. The BOD5/COD ratio was also 33.3% which indicates a majority of the organics in the wastewater were not degradable by the activated sludge microorganisms. This BOD5 was also much lower compared to the BOD5 for the activated sludge treating either untreated petroleum refinery wastewater or municipal tap water. The estimated COD of 26.4 mg O2/L also resulted in an initial F/M ratio of approximately 0.026 kg COD/kg VSS, as calculated in Appendix M. This F/M ratio was below typical biological treatment guidelines and should have resulted in a higher rate of endogenous respiration (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). A B type BOD curve was expected where the residual organic compounds were degraded through oxidation and synthesis biological reactions after which endogenous respiration would take place and result in an increased oxygen consumption. However, endogenous respiration did not occurr since Figure 4.7 shows that a D type BOD curve was produced which indicates that the wastewater was inhibitory or toxic to the activated sludge microorganisms. The UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater had a pH of 7.0 which is within the optimum pH for bacteria growth (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). Therefore, the pH of the wastewater did not have an effect on the activated sludge microorganisms since the BOD5 did not improve when the pH was adjusted from 5.0 to 7.0. This once again shows that untreated refinery wastewater was very biodegradable and the refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process was inhibitory to the activated sludge from the refinery WWTP. The treated wastewater was inhibitory due to either improper degradation of the wastewater organics where the new intermediate compound structures increased the toxicity of the wastewater, the activated sludge microorganisms were not

54

acclimatized to the new intermediate compounds or the residual H2O2 concentration was toxic to the activated sludge microorganisms. The UV/H2O2 treated wastewater was not biodegradable since it most likely inhibited the activated sludge microorganisms. One reason for a low oxygen uptake by the activated sludge was improper degradation of the organics where the structure of the compounds changed in a way that increases the toxicity of the wastewater (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). This study did not include analyzing the molecular structure of the wastewater constituents. Therefore, it is recommended to further investigate the molecular structure of the initial, intermediate and final wastewater constituents during biological, UV/H2O2 and combined process treatments. The activated sludge microorganisms may not have been acclimatized to the new intermediate compounds in the UV/H2O2 treated wastewater. Combining a UV/H2O2 and

biological treatment process may require re-acclimatization since the activated sludge may not have the specific microorganisms present in the microbial community or enzymes required to degrade the new intermediate compounds (Scott and Ollis, 1995). It is recommended to further evaluate combining chemical and biological treatment process to assess if the overall treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater can be improved High concentrations of H2O2 can also adversely affect the activated sludge microorganisms. As stated previously, the initial H2O2 concentration was between 202 and 1,023 mg H2O2/L. This initial H2O2 concentration range was much lower than what was found in literature since a similar study treating refinery wastewater with a UV/H2O2 process used an initial H2O2 concentration of 1,000 mg/L for pre biological treatment and 5,000 mg/L for post biological treatment (Juang et al. 1997). Typically, an initial concentration of approximately 100 mg H2O2/L adversely affects the activated sludge microorganisms due to a high residual
55

concentration of H2O2 (Scott and Ollis, 1995).

It has been shown that a residual H2O2

concentration of 3 ­ 7 mg H2O2/L did not affect activated sludge microorganisms (Laera et al. 2012). This study did not include measuring the residual concentration of H2O2 in the UV/H2O2 treated wastewater. Therefore, it is recommended to further investigate how residual H2O2 affects the activity of the activated sludge microorganisms. It should also be highlighted that there is always risk of equipment failing or not working properly during normal operation. In this case, since the wastewater was required to be acidified down to 5.0 which was below the optimum pH range of 6.5 and 7.5 for biological treatment, it is assumed that the pH would have to be adjusted back up to the optimum biological treatment operating range (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003). In the event that the caustic addition fails, the acidic water would pose a risk to the biological treatment unit as previously described. Overall, a UV/H2O2 process was currently not suitable as a pre-treatment for the biological treatment unit since the UV/H2O2 treated refinery wastewater inhibited the refinery activated sludge microorganisms. This occurred when the raw refinery wastewater was treated with a UV/H2O2 process for 45 min, with an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.8 mol H2O2/mol C, an initial H2O2 concentration of 202 mg H2O2/L and a pH of either 5 or 7. Using a UV/H2O2 process as a post-treatment after the biological treatment unit at a refinery WWTP was not examined. The refinery where the wastewater and activated sludge was collected from did not have an issue meeting the regulated effluent TOC limit so it was deemed unnecessary to test this scenario.

56

Figure 4.9 shows that the average WWTP effluent TOC concentration from the Suncor Mississauga Refinery between January 2004 and December 2011 has not exceeded the regulated effluent TOC concentration limit (Ontario, 2013). The average effluent TOC concentration between January 2004 and December 2011 was 3.7 mg C/L which was approximately 32% of the regulated effluent concentration of 11.6 mg C/L (Ontario, 2011). The raw data and the calculated regulated effluent concentration limit are outlined in Appendix N. It should also be noted, that the highest treatment performance of a UV/H2O2 process to treat refinery wastewater resulted in a final TOC concentration of 9.9 mg C/L as shown in Table 4.3 which was approximately 85% of the regulated effluent concentration of 11.6 mg C/L (Ontario, 2011). Therefore, a bench scale UV/H2O2 process was not able to even achieve a treatment efficiency comparable to the current refinery WWTP biological treatment process. A UV/H2O2 process must be used with caution at a petroleum refinery WWTP since it contradicts the purpose of the current MISA regulation. There is always a risk of equipment failing or not working properly. The UV/H2O2 process required the wastewater to be acidified down to 5.0 which is below the regulated effluent pH range 6.0 to 9.5 as required by Ontario Regulation 537/93 the MISA Effluent Monitoring and Effluent Limits for the Petroleum Sector (Ontario, 1993). The effluent pH would have to be adjusted back up to a regulated effluent limit of 6.0 to 9.5 before being discharged out to the environment to maintain regulatory compliance. In the event that the caustic addition fails, the acidic water would violate the regulated MISA effluent quality and produce a toxic effluent which goes against the purpose of the MISA regulation and result in financial penalties from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment due to regulatory non-compliance.

It should also be noted that installing a new UV/H2O2 process at a petroleum refinery WWTP would be in contravention of the current Ontario Regulation 455/09 or Toxic Reduction Act (TRA) regulation. The pH of the wastewater was required to be decreased for a UV/H2O2 process to actually remove organic compounds. In a full scale application, a UV/H2O2 process would require the addition of an acid such a sulphuric acid or even hydrochloric acid. However, both sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid are listed in the TRA. Instead of reducing the use of these toxic substances, using a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater requires more use of a toxic substance which does not comply with O. Reg 455/09.

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1 CONCLUSIONS The first phase of experiments was an initial screening of how the reaction time, the initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio and the system pH affected the treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater using a UV/H2O2 process. Lowering the pH to 4.0 and increasing the reaction time to 30 min significantly increased the TOC reduction as indicated from the three factor ANOVA analysis. There was no significant difference in TOC reduction if the experiment took place at an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of either 2.9 or 8.6 mol H2O2/mol C as indicated from the three factor ANOVA analysis. The lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.9 mol H2O2/mol C was chosen as the best performance since a lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio means less H2O2 was being used in the treatment process. Therefore, the best performance for the initial experimental testing was chosen at a reaction time of 30 min, an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 2.9 mol H2O2/mol C, and a pH of 4.0. The second phase of experiments was performed to improve the performance of a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater. A three factor ANOVA analysis confirmed again that a UV/H2O2 process to treat petroleum refinery wastewater was significantly more effective at reducing the TOC when the reaction time was increased. The three factor ANOVA analysis also indicated that the treatment performance increases when the pH is reduced from 6.0 to 5.0, but then the treatment performance decreases when the pH is further
60

reduced from 5.0 to 4.0. Therefore, the best treatment performance took place at a reaction time of 45 minutes and a pH of 5.0. There was no significant difference in TOC reduction if the experiment took place at an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of either 1.7, 2.8 or 3.9 mol H2O2/mol C as indicated from the three factor ANOVA analysis. The lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C was chosen as the best performance since a lower initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio would result in less H2O2 being used. Using less H2O2 in the process would reduce the cost of the UV/H2O2 process. Therefore, the best performance was chosen at a reaction time of 45 min, an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C, and a pH of 5.0. Decreasing the pH consumed alkalinity in the wastewater which minimized hydroxyl radical scavenging reactions and resulted in a higher UV/H2O2 process treatment performance. Increasing the reaction time allowed for more time for the reaction to take place and also resulted in a higher UV/H2O2 process treatment performance. Overall, these results confirm and support the work previously completed by Juang et al. (1997) and Stepnowski et al. (2002). A UV/H2O2 process was found not to be suitable as a pre-treatment process for the refinery biological treatment unit since the UV/H2O2 treated refinery wastewater inhibited the refinery activated sludge microorganisms. This occurred when the raw refinery wastewater was treated with a UV/H2O2 process at the best treatment parameters of 45 min, with an initial H2O2/TOC molar ratio of 1.7 mol H2O2/mol C, an initial H2O2 concentration of 202 mg H2O2/L and a pH of either 5 or 7. The effects of untreated petroleum refinery wastewater were tested using respirometry and was found to be very biodegradable by the activated sludge from the petroleum refinery WWTP since the BOD5 was 87.2 mg O2/L and the measured oxygen demand displayed a characteristic A type BOD curve due to active microorganisms. Municipal tap water was then seeded with activated sludge from the petroleum refinery WWTP and respirometry was

used to show that active microorganisms were present since the BOD5 was 46.4 mg O2/L and the measured oxygen demand displayed a characteristic C type BOD curve due to endogenous respiration. The petroleum refinery wastewater which was treated with a UV/H2O2 process was inhibitory to the activated sludge microorganisms from the refinery WWTP since the BOD5 measured was only 9.3 and 8.8 mg O2/L at a pH of 5.0 or 7.0 respectively. The oxygen demand also displayed a characteristic D type BOD curve due to microbial inhibition. Therefore, the UV/H2O2 treated petroleum refinery wastewater had a inhibitory effect on the refinery WWTP activated sludge microorganisms. The treated wastewater was inhibitory due to either improper degradation of the wastewater organics where the new intermediate compound structures increased the toxicity of the wastewater, the activated sludge microorganisms were not acclimatized to the new intermediate compounds or the residual H2O2 concentration was toxic to the activated sludge microorganisms. Finally, a UV/H2O2 process is currently not suitable for full scale application in a petroleum refinery WWTP due to the incompatibility with current environmental regulations. The UV/H2O2 process required the pH of the wastewater to be decreased to 5.0 which was well below the optimum pH range of 6.5 and 7.5 for activated sludge microorganisms. This poses a risk to the biological treatment unit which can result in discharging effluent that exceeds regulatory limits and result in financial penalties from the Ontario MOE due to regulatory noncompliance. Decreasing the pH to 5.0 was also below the regulated effluent pH range 6.0 to 9.5 as required by Ontario Regulation 537/93 the MISA Effluent Monitoring and Effluent Limits for the Petroleum Sector. Equipment failure could result in violating the regulated MISA effluent quality and result in financial penalties from the Ontario MOE due to regulatory non-compliance. It should also be noted that using a UV/H2O2 process would also be in contravention with
62

Ontario Regulation 455/09, the Toxic Reduction Act. Instead of reducing the use of toxic substances such as sulphuric acid, using a UV/H2O2 process to treat refinery wastewater requires more use of toxic substances and in turn does not comply with O. Reg 455/09.

5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS The following are a list of recommendations from this work:  There may be also other compounds present in the refinery wastewater which could scavenge hydroxyl radicals and decrease the performance of a UV/H2O2 process including chlorides and various weak acids. It is recommended to investigate the

composition of refinery wastewater to identify other compounds that would scavenge hydroxyl radicals and affect the performance of a UV/H2O2 process. Identifying the specific compounds in refinery wastewater was not within the scope of this work. Compounds can be identified using analytical tools such as gas chromatography­mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  There appeared to be a maximum treatment performance at a pH of 5. The literature does state that the treatment performance maximum for a UV/H2O2 process is typically between a pH of 3 and 5. However, the references to those specific works were not accessible since Ryerson does not have a license for the required journal or text book. It is recommended to further examine why the treatment performance of a UV/H2O2 process may start to decrease as the pH continues to decrease. This can be accomplished by measuring the initial and final concentrations of TOC, pH, alkalinity and residual

63

H2O2 to track how they change at various pH values. These additional measurements were not within the scope of this work.  One reason for a low oxygen uptake by the activated sludge would be improper degradation of the organics where the structure of the compounds changed in a way that increases the toxicity of the wastewater. Analyzing the molecular structure of the

wastewater constituents was not within the scope of this work. It is recommended to investigate the molecular structure of the initial, intermediate and final wastewater constituents during biological, UV/H2O2 and combined process treatments. Compounds can be identified using analytical tools such as gas chromatography­mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  Combining a UV/H2O2 and biological treatment process may require re-acclimatization of the activated sludge since the activated sludge may not have the specific microorganisms present in the microbial community or enzymes required to degrade the new intermediate compounds. It is recommended to evaluate combining chemical and biological treatment processes to assess if the overall treatment of petroleum refinery wastewater can be improved. This can be done by settling up a lab scale AOP reactor connected to a lab scale biological treatment unit and running continuous experiments. This type of additional experimentation was not within the scope of this work.  High concentrations of H2O2 can also adversely affect the activated sludge microorganisms. Measuring the residual concentration of H2O2 in the UV/H2O2 treated wastewater was not within the scope of this work. It is recommended to investigate how residual hydrogen peroxide affects the activity of the activated sludge microorganisms.

64

This can be done by dosing activated sludge with wastewater containing measured residual concentrations of H2O2 and measuring the oxygen uptake through respirometry.  There is potential to develop a model of a combined UV/H2O2 and biological treatment process. The model should include 4 different function including treatment performance, regulated effluent limits, operating cost and toxicity. These four functions can then be solved simultaneously to identify how a combined UV/H2O2 and biological treatment system can be operated in order to maximize treatment performance, stay within regulated effluent limits, minimize operating costs and minimize toxicity. Developing a model was not within the scope of this work since it requires a lot of additional research into combined treatment performance, combined operating costs, and toxicity limits.

APPENDICIES
APPENDIX A: COD/TOC CORRELATION CALCULATIONS The following equation outlines how the organic material is converted to carbon dioxide (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003):

(A.1) Where (A.2)

Developing a correlation between COD and TOC is important since the COD can be estimated by measuring the TOC of a wastewater and multiplying the result by a developed correlation (Eckenfelder, 2000). This correlation is essentially a carbon-oxygen balance (Eckenfelder, 2000). For example, a simple organic compound such as glucose would have a COD/TOC ratio of 2.67 mg COD/mg TOC. The calculation is as follows: (A.3) (A.4)

Where, molar mass of molecular oxygen (O2) = 32 g / mol O2 molar mass of carbon = 12 g / mol C

The COD/TOC ratio will change based on the characteristics of the wastewater especially if it contains aromatic and nitrogen-containing compounds (Eckenfelder, 2000). However, an
66

initial COD/TOC ratio estimate of 2.67 mg COD/mg TOC is typically used for industrial wastewater until a plant specific COD/TOC ratio can be developed (Eckenfelder, 2000). Eckenfelder (2000), also found that the typical COD/TOC ratio for a petrochemical refinery was 2.70 mg COD/mg TOC which is close to the recommended initial estimate COD/TOC ratio of 2.67 mg COD/mg TOC.

APPENDIX L: OXIDATION OF SULPHIDE COMPOUNDS Refinery hydrocarbon feedstocks contain varying amounts of sulphur. Refinery processes, specifically hydroprocessing units, convert the sulphur atoms into sulphide (S2-) ions. Sulphides must be removed from the process streams in order to prevent excessive corrosion and plugging of refinery equipment as well as to meet regulated product quality specifications such as ultra-low sulphur diesel. Hydroprocessing reactor effluent streams are washed with water to dilute and dissolve the sulphide ions from the hydrocarbon phase into the water phase. This sour water is then separated from the hydrocarbon stream and is sent to the WWTP for further treatment.

80

Sulphide (S2-) ions are a very strong base and will completely react with water according to equation L.1 (Oxtoby et al. 2002). (L.1) The dissociation constant (Kb) for the reaction L.1 is on the order of 105 (Oxtoby et al. 2002). This means that essentially there are no S2- sulphide ions present in an aqueous solution (Oxtoby et al. 2002). At a neutral and basic pH, only HS- sulphide ions will be present in an aqueous solution (Oxtoby et al. 2002). As the pH of the aqueous solution starts to decrease, the concentration of OH- species will also decrease (Oxtoby et al. 2002). The addition of H3O+ will decrease the concentration of HS- sulphide ions of the aqueous solution since the equilibrium would shift to the right in reaction L.2 (Oxtoby et al. 2002). (L.2) The oxidation of sulphide (HS-) by oxygen (O2) in an aqueous solution takes place according to reactions L.3, L.4 and L.5 (Avrahami and Golding, 1968).

(L.3)

Rate Limiting Step: Sulphide (HS-) oxidized to Sulphite (SO32-) Rapid Step: Sulphite (SO32-) oxidized to Sulphate (SO43-) Overall Reaction: Sulphide (HS-) oxidized to Sulphate (SO43-)

(L.4) (L.5)

The calculation to estimate the chemical oxygen demand (COD) associated with oxidizing sulphides follows equation L.6.

81

(L.6) Where, Estimated Chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration Sulphide concentration Oxygen Molar Mass Sulphide Molar Mass

Therefore, equation L.6 can be simplified as equation L.7.

(L.7) Avrahami and Golding (1968), did not determine the rate of the reaction for reactions L.3, L.4 or L.5. The following table outlines various reaction rates throughout literature. Table L.1: Literature Review of Oxidation of Sulphide Reaction Rates
