ABSTRACT
The Extremist Islmnist Presence in Canadian Webspace: An Etnpirical Study Master of Arts. 2006 Neil Thmnson. Comtnunication and Culture, Ryerson University and York University

This paper outlines the results of a two 1nonth study in which a series of extremist Islmnist websitcs - registered, hosted or given dataccntre services by Canadian internet companies- were empirically observed. The results of this project are inserted into a frmnework which explores the tnisuse and wrongful application of the "terrorisf signifier to substatc or nonstate activities, discerns between the purported use of the internet by extremist Islamist organizations for destructive means and the real use of the internet by such groups, and suggests a number of conclusions based on prior administrative responses to the extretnist Islmnist use of the internet. The full results of this project can he viewed at http://www.stonnloader.com/metnbers/nordicfury.

I would like to thank my supervisor Greg Ehner, for the excellent feedback he was able to provide through our tnany, Friday afternoon group presentations. This went a long way toward helping tne with the basis for this project. My secondary readers Atnin Alhassan and Patricia Mazepa also provided extensive and tnuch needed feedback on this project as well. Olatokunbo Olaleye and Chris Cachia were instrutnental in helping me get through this, even when I was close to abandoning the project entirely. And my tnother, tnost of all, kept me afloat throughout this entire ordeal, despite all of tny tnoaning and complaining.

I. INTRODUCTION
The arrival of the ·infonnation age· has witnessed a significant restructuring of control over the n1anagen1ent of transnational information flows. Spurred on by the phenomenal proliferation ofNICT.s at the close of the twentieth century and given wind by our progression into a global, networked economy in which some believe the primary resource will be information (Toffler, 1970, Nasbitt, 1982, Negroponte, 1995), a considerable redistribution of authority has seen non-traditional stakeholders - namely substate and non-state actors - rising to challenge the dmninance previously enjoyed over the information environn1ent by state and corporate actors (Leistyna, 2005). This
1

challenge has resulted in the tipping of the ''political balance away from the state and toward activists .. (Perry & Sindayen, 2001 ), and has led some to posit the infonnation enviromnent as a pri1nary site of struggle wherein state and non state actors will battle ulti1nately - for control over the right to 1nanage public perception of international events (Zanini, in Jones, 2004). Foren1ost among transpirations i1npelling this struggle has been the establishment of the inten1et. Developed in 1969 as the ARPANET - a U.S. Depart1nent of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) initiative - and fonnally opened to civilian and c01n1nercial interests in 1985, the internet first cmne into wide-scale use by the general public after the invention of the World Wide Web by Ti1n Berners-Lee in 1990 (Galloway, 2004, Naughton, 2002). '"In less than ten
years,~'

the internet became

"indispensable to In any people in their daily lives'' (Hoffman et al, 2004, p. 3 7) and is now viewed by some as a precondition for the functionality of affairs in the Western world.
1

With a 2006 estimate putting the total number of world internet users at 694

New Information and Communication Technologies

million- or 14 percent of the world· s population (Australian, 2006, p.32) cmnpared to 38 million at the end of 1994 ( dns.net I 998), the assertion that "the adoption rate of the Internet has exceeded that of earlier mass communication technologies by several rnagnitudcs .. (Hannemyr.
~003)

finds little dispute. as docs the inference that the global

explosion in internet usage has allotted sections of the vvorlcf s population greater leverage over local and international political processes. Since its inception, the internet has provided a "global voice to radically excluded groups .. (Dartnell, 2006, introduction) resulting in the dissemination of ''infonnation and culture that exists beyond the rneans of control of the dominant order'' (Kahn and Kellner in Leistyna, 2005, p. 218). Instrumental in the development of new forms of resistance, the internet has become a means to ernpowennent for a plethora of organizations existing beneath or outside of the state, allowing subversive groups to challenge elite definitions of reality by gaining a greater control over their own rnessage (Van de Dank et al, 2004 ). In many ways. the internet can be thought of as essential to the pursuit of counterhegernonic, infonnation-related initiatives. Whereas the Mexican Zapatista rnovement of Southen1 Mexico and the Falun Gong organization in (and outside of) China have both made use of the inten1et to provide an information front to their respective struggles (Van de Dank et al, 2004), the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAW A) maintains an online presence to tight for human rights and social justice on the Central Asian continent. Environmental groups - such as Greenpeace - have generated websites seeking to bring public attention to issues such as toxic waste and genetically modified organisms, while activist groups such as those responsible for organizing the Seattle protests of 1999 have proven the internet to be a forum through which

2

comtnunication, counter-infonnation and organization are made possible (Van de Donk et al, 2004 ).
It is clear that the internet has becon1e a significant vehicle for the facilitation of

afTinnative sub state and non-state activities. In its ability to provide publics and counter publics with a method for subverting official information channels, it has allowed dissenting groups to conduct ·· ... discussion. interconnections and struggles on a global

level in ways that challenge and often bypass both the nation-state and its creations" (Cleaver, 1997, n.p.) and has generated postulations that the internet may the first emancipatory, public sphere capable of giving rise to global, revolutionary activity (Van de Donk et al, 2004). At the same time as facilitating the pursuit of positive activities by sub state and non-state actors - however - the internet also provides a voice for factions seeking different aims. The idea that "The activists one finds on the net are not all necessarily democratic in character. .. '' (Van de Donk et al, 2004, foreword) underscores the reality that, just as the internet has become a platform for groups com1nitted to emancipatory, or forward-looking ideals, it has also becmne a social space for those opposed to progressive initiatives. As opposing assemblages "" ... characteristically see different possibilities in the usage of a given technology .... , (Burnett and Marshall, 2003, p.127), the e1nployment of the internet for '"'" ... both progressive and reactionary causes by an abundance of groups'' (Kahn and Kellner in Leistyna, 2005, p. 218) is not surprising. With the websites of ncoNazi groups, right-wing militias, religious fundamentalists and an assortment of other antagonistic groups found on the internet (Yagil, 2002), notions of the '"information

3

superhighway· as a space reserved for constructive activism arc problematized - as opposed to a forUJn solely populated hy left-leaning and populist ideals. the inten1et can instead be seen as multiplicitous, an environment marked hy a host of noble - as well as condemnable - challenges to the official control of global infon11ation flows (Kahn and Kellner in Leistyna, 2005) At present, perhaps the most significant of groups using the inten1et for aims not considered
'progressive~

are those that can be classified under the rubric of ·extremist

Islmnism'. Regarded '"by knowledgeable observers to have the largest presence on the weh .. (Swartz, 2005, p.03b) mnong subversive groups, the extre1nist Islmnist internet population, in tenns of websites " ... has rocketed to 4,350 from a dozen in 199T. (Swartz, 2005, 03b ). According to Gabriel Weimann, professor of communications at the

University of Haifa in Israel, the extremist Islamist presence on the internet now 1nakes up about 70 percent of the almost 4, 700 extremist sites in operation worldwide (Weimann, 2006). Revelatory of the degree to which extre1nist lslmnist groups are

'" ... increasingly using the internet and websites to prmnote their causes" (Kahn and Kellner in Leistyna, 2005, p. 225), Weimann's postulation indicates a significantly higher rate of IT adoption among extremist Islmnist organizations than other radicalist groups, and promotes an understanding of the fact that extremist Islamist organizations have successfully tnoved to cyberspace where they now have a platform from which to extend their reach transnationally.

II. INTENT OF PAPER

What this paper intends to do is to elucidate the findings of a two-month research project in which a series of extremist Islmnist websites - hosted, housed or registered by Canadian internet cmnpanies - were observed. The overall project - one intended to create a background understanding of the presence of extremist Islmnist sites in Canadian webspace - will be fit into a framework intended to explore the extre1nist Islamist use of Canadian registrars, service providers or datacentres and the motives of Canadian state actors- the Federal Government, Canadian intelligence, law enforce1nent- in countering the use of Canadian web space by extremist Islamist groups. The choice to examine the extremist Islmnist use of the world wide web as opposed to - for example - the use of the internet by white, ethnonationalist extre1nist groups or ecological extremist groups stems from a desire to docUJnent a contemporary and ill-understood phenomenon. Extremist Islmnism, the current phase in what Walter Laquer defines as "The Age of Terrorism''
2 ,

is a widely discussed topic about which

many 1nisconceptions exist, just as the extremist Islamist use of the inten1et is an emerging area of investigation prone to erroneous beliefs. A study of how extre1nist Islamist groups are e1nploying the services of Canadian ISP's is not only warranted because of its potential to grant insight into a current trend, but even n1ore so because of its ability to provide - for academics, researchers and students - an exploration of how cyberspace is becoming a forum for collectivity and dissent, just as it evolves into an arena of surveillance and policing.

2

The 'Age of Terrorism' signifies the different phases throughout the 19 1h century to the present - in which specific extremist groups have been sensationalized by govemments and the media for the purpose of galvanizing public condemnation and indignancy (Laquer, 1977).

5

This initiative will begin with a short explanation of the tcnninology to be used in this report as well as the rationale behind the use of the chosen terminology. Following this section, this paper will then delve into the question of "what is tenoris1n .. _ explaining who defines tenoris1n, what the term is used for and finally, why the ten11 1nust be abandoned in light of its overbroad and problematic nature. An exploration of the

extremist Islmnist use of the web - both fictional and factual - will then be undertaken. This will provide a contrast between the portrayal, by state and corporate actors, of "cyber-tenoris1n' as the dominant agenda behind the extre1nist Islmnist use of cyberspace, versus smne of the ways in which extremist Islamist groups actually use the inten1et. Finally, the project itself will be detailed in terms of its intent, 1nethods, results and implications. The paper will end with an investigation into the final results of the project, and the extremist Islmnist use of Canadian web space and the ad1ninistrative response to it will be placed into context. At the conclusion of this paper, I hope to provide - for the reader - not only an awareness of which extremist Islamist websites are being hosted by Canadian internet cmnpanies and why. As this report adjourns, I also intended to infer that new laws and policies toward existing technologies in Canada - while supposedly being implemented, in part, to track extre1nist Islamist activities on the web- are actually being used for other purposes, most significantly, the attempt to place a stranglehold over the online environment. The extremist Islamist employment of Canadian internet companies and the resultant attack on internet freedoms by the Canadian security establishment - it will be concluded - can be viewed in the context of an asymmetric struggle for control over

6

the internet itself~ the outemne of which tnay define the very future of the Canadian online world.

III. TERMINOLOGY TO APPEAR IN THIS REPORT

Prior to any exploration of a topic as contentious as inten1ational extreinist activity, one· s choice of terminology must be based on cautious deliberation and selective interpretation. The following section - intended to detail tenns to be used in this report, will elucidate the definitions of specific tenns. As well, explanations will be provided as to the choice of particular idioms. This list is not to be considered all inclusive- the likelihood is present that certain tenns, while self-evident to many readers, will not appear as such to others. As well, certain tenns will be left out for the reason that their explanation will be considered unnecessary. In this report, the term extremist lslamist will be used to indicate those groups who hold Islam as a political system as well as a religion, who seek to remodel state governance based on a strict interpretation of Sharia law, and whose advocacy for direct, n1ilitant action against perceived "anti-Islamic' forces puts them at odds with the hegemonic powers of the Western world as well as the mainstream of their own faith. The first part of this tenn, the word 'extremisf, will be employed - in the context of this report - to describe subversive, Islamist groups which espouse extremist viewpoints and which may or n1ay not endorse specific acts of violence. The word

·Islmnisf will be used with the understanding that Islmnism is a " ... political ideology rooted in interpretations of Islmn'' (Nassar, 2004, p. 87) and does not represent the mode of thinking of the majority of the world's Muslims.
It is hoped that the use of the

"extremist Islamist' marker- in this report -- will draw a separation between the Islamic

8

faith and Islan1ist Inilitancy, with the result that the reader will be able to discern between a religion of Inillions and the actions of a few. The tenn Canadian webspace will be einployed m this report to connote any Canadian service provider, datacenter or registrar providing- knowingly or unknowingly - services to extremist Islamist groups. In the context of this paper, a necessary

separation will be drawn between registrars. sen·ice providers and datacentres, noting that each of these tenns indicates a different type of service being rendered to a specific client. The tenn Canadian Internet Companies will similarly be used in this report to describe those ISP's (internet service providers) in Canada allotting expertise or services to extremist Islatnist groups. In this paper, the tenn Registrar will be used to indicate an internet company providing a registration service - that Is, registering the domain name (such as www.khilafah.net) - of a client for a fee. The term Sen;ice Pro1·ider will connote any internet company hosting a client's website on their servers. The tenn Datacentre will be etnployed to describe a company housing a large amount of data on multiple servers, including - but not limited to - websites and online software progratns. The tenn Cyber-terrorism appears in this paper solely on the basis of describing how online ·terrorism' has been traditionally conceived of. ·cyber-terrorism', which

indicates the malicious use of the world-wide web to disrupt or attack essential services or critical infrastructure (Yagil, 2002), will be used to provide a backdrop for a discussion

9

I ·

II

on the true usc of the web by cxtre1nist Islamist groups, and will be used only to note incorrect conceptions of online extrcn1is1n. Finally, in this report, the tenn Terrorism or any of its variants will only appear in single quotation marks. This is partially because - as will be detailed later- terrorisrn is a problematic, floating signifier, a term too overbroad and general to be of any real use in the elucidation of extremist thought and action. The term "terrorisf will only be used in the context of citing the quotations of other authors, and will not appear in this report as a significant marker in 1ny descriptive lexicon.
It is hoped that ·- with these tenns having been extrapolated frmn the outset - the

reader of this report will be able to better navigate through this paper with a 1ninin1al level of confusion. It is also hoped that the potentially contentious nature of this project will be mitigated through an understanding that the terms chosen herein are meant to be sensitive to the beliefs of academics, social activists, and 1nost of all, Muslims worldwide. It is 1ny expectation that highly loaded and disputed tenns can be kept to a minimum, or at the very least, put into context, so that an objective and unbiased look at both the extre1nist Islamist use of Canadian webspace as well as the administrative response to it can be undertaken.

IV. WHAT CONSTITUTES AN 4 EXTREl\1IST ISLAMIST WEBSITE'?

The question of what constitutes an "extren1ist Islamist website· is one that needs to be addressed- at this point - not solely on the basis of the perception that such sites are a recent addition to the internet landscape (Wei1nann, 2006), but also because of the fact that no concrete attempts have been made, to 1ny knowledge, to elucidate the definition of an · extrcn1ist Islamist website· to date. As the study of Islamist activity vis-a-vis the

internet is itself a new field of enquiry, the lack of an attempt to define what constitutes and extre1nist Islamist website- in literary circles - is not unexpected. With this notion in mind, I will offer the following, working definition. For the purpose of this essay, an extremist Islamist website will be defined as a comrr1unication 1nodule through which extremist Islatnist groups can broadcast, network, recruit and plan, and which allows such groups to create an idealized, virtual space for 1ne1nbers and supporters. The designation of a website as extremist Islmnist will be

based on the following criteria: · Its affiliation with a group federally designated as "extremist' under Canadian law · Its intent being that of a propaganda - as opposed to a news - conduit · Its content being decidedly slanted in favour of the extre1nist Islatnist perspective The idea of classifying certain sites into the category of "extremist Islamist' is proble1natic, partially because categorization is largely contingent on one making a value judgement about what constitutes an ·extremist Islatnist website·. Even more

problematically, the grouping of a series of websites under the "extremist Islamist' label could be viewed as beneficial to state and corporate actors wishing to recreate a power structure over the internet similar to that which exists in real life. In this sense, the idea of providing a concrete definition of an "extremist Islamist website' is complicated,

11

although for the purpose of this paper it is the tenn 1nust be provisionally defined in order to avoid confusion, and in hopes of providing future researchers with a platfonn on which to eventually reach smne kind of a consensus as to the fundamentals which constitute the tenn.

V. WHAT IS 'TERRORISl\1' A. Definitional Struggles

The term "terrorisin · has long been considered ·· ... an extremely ditlicult concept to define .. (Mullins, 1997. p.11 ). Owing to capricious treatJnents of the descriptor, a

precise explication of what constitutes the "terrorism' signifier has never been solidified. There is no universally agreed-upon definition of the term (Weimann and Wynn, 1994). According to N acos (2006 ), the definition of terroris1n has been applied (by goven11nents, security forces, acade1nics and researchers) so inconsistently that its precise delineationeven among govermnental departJnents - varies to the point of incongruity. Terroris1n it can be stated - is a floating signifier of the highest severity, its tneaning dependent upon '" ... who you are and why you are bothering to define iC (Tmnan, 2003, p. 11 ), its use rooted in selective interpretations of what constitutes ·a terrorist acf.
B. History

The tenn "'TerrorisC first appears in the English lexicon at the end of the eighteenth century in revolutionary France (Weinberg, 2005). The architects of the

execution of Louis XVI and the subsequent Jacobin "reign of terror' ( 1793-1794) are described by the English author Edtnund Burke as 'thousands of those hell hounds called terrorisf, unleashed upon the people of France (Laquer, 1977). At the end of the

nineteenth century, the tenn 'terrorism· is widely used again, this time by European and American heads of state in describing the actions of revolutionary anarchists purportedly linked to a vast, worldwide, anti-state conspiracy (Tuman, 2003). In Russia, the

N arodnaya Volya (1878-1881) revolutionary group - credited with the assassination of

Tsar Alexander II - earns the 'terrorisf label (Thackrah, 1987). And in the twentieth

13

century. groups with aims ranging fron1 the struggle for working class rights to socialist revolutionaries to right-wing paramilitaries are all grouped - at one ti1ne or other- under the rubric of ·terrorism·.

C.

Usc and l\1isusc of the term

~Terrorism'

At present - there are postulations that the signifier of 'terrorism· can be applied to almost any political, religious or ideologically 1notivated undertaking (Conway, 2002). The notion that the term ·· ... has been used in so many different senses as to becmne ahnost 1neaningless, covering ahnost any, and not necessarily political, act of violence ... ·· (Laquer, 1977, p.ll) underscores recognition - by 1nany academics-- that the 'terrorist" label is a blanket ten11 used to generalize the activities of a vast number of substate and non state actors, and not a specific 1narker useful in elucidating the actions of any specific group. "Terrorisn1. is viewed - mnong prmninent authors, scholars and academics - as a value-laden generalization, its 1neaningful use negated by its inherent abuse at the hands of those in positions of authority. Paradoxically, those who 1nost frequently abuse the term "terrorism' are those who are 1nost likely to provide definitions for it (Laquer, 1977). Government officials, who are "" ... in more advantageous position than other political actors to confer the 'f word on groups or withhold it. .. ,. (N acos, 2006, p. 19), create working definitions of terrorism as 1nuch for their own inten1al communications as to provide a platform on which to confer disadvantage onto societally undesirable elements. Consider some of the following definitions of "terrorism', provided by the Canadian legal and security establishments: The Canadian cri1ninal code defines terrorism as an action that is:

14

'"·taken for political. religious or ideological purposes and inti1nidates the public concerning its security. or compels a goven11nent to do something, by intentionally killing. seriously banning or endangering a person, causing substantial property dan1age that is likely to seriously hann people or by seriously interfering with or disrupting an essential service, facility or system. ( canada.justice.gc.ca, 200 I) Under this definition of ·terrorism·. the act of ·terror· is c01nmitted - on ideological, political or religious grounds - to intitnidate the public or to force the hand of the govermnent by causing serious han11 to persons or property. This definition - although assumedly intended to cri1ninalize acts of violence and destruction - retnains vague enough in its wording so as to apply to lawful acts such as strikes and labour protests. CSIS, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service, tneanwhile, defines 'terroristn' as:

"'activities within or relating to Canada directed toward or in support of the threat or use of acts of serious violence against persons or property for the purpose of achieving a political, religious or ideological objective within Canada or a foreign state·· ( esis.gc.ca, 1985)

This definition moves beyond intitnidation and violence to include those who support the threat of violence, against both persons or property. This definition also recognizes the transnational nature of "terror· as it defines, as an act of '"terrorism', any international undertaking of opportunistic violence against Canadian interests. Under this definition of '"terrorism', actions not in favour of Canada within a foreign state- including the support of those who speak out against Canadian interests - could conceivably be considered an act of terrorism. Again, the vague wording of this definition broadens its scope to cover a wider range of people than those whom one would normally consider ·terrorists'.

15

.. ---------l

It is clear that the "terrorism· signifier allows governments to label certain sub

state or non state actors "subversives·. in the process demonizing undesirable groups and publics. More i1nportantly - however- is the notion that the lack of a universal definition for the term "terroris1n · allc)\VS states to apply the "terrorist" label while refuting charges that the activities they themselves engage in are "terrorist" in nature
(Hartlnan~

2002).

Just as states define 'terroris1n · to distinguish between illegiti1nate violence and dissent practiced by those who oppose the state fron1 their own "legitimate·· form of violence (Olivero, 1998), states also refuse to accede to internationally agreed-upon consensuses on what defines "terror· in order to abrogate accountability for the con11nission of what could be termed ·acts of state terroris1n · (Conway, 2002). In their paradoxical use of the terrorism signifier, states take a contradictory stance regarding 'terrorisf activity, and in doing so, lead to accusations that the real goal - in defining "terrorisin · - is not really to fight
'terror~,

but to create a convenient label with which to offload responsibility for the

majority of the world's violent activities on to a subordinate group (Hartlnan, 2002). The tenn 'terrorism· -as a value laden concept without any real acade1nic meritis thus at best a general label used to encompass a wide range of political, religious or ideologically motivated activities and at worst a net ensnaring a variety of subversive as well as lawful, civil groups in its grasp. In its vague and overbroad nature, "terrorism· is little more than " ... a se1nantic technique employed by government spokespersons to change the subject, a slick way of transforming the victims of injustice into its perpetrators"' (Weinberg, 2005, p. 1). In this sense, the transposition of the 'terrorist"

label is less about separating lawful groups from unlawful groups, and more about ostracizing certain, sub state actors frmn the state itself.

16

Conclusions
It is partially because of the ambiguities associated with the term ·terrorisin · that

the application of this title to specific political, religious or ideologically 1notivated actions should be done cautiously in acadetnia. Absent a clearly delineated, inten1ational consensus of what defines "terrorism·, the risk re1nains that the ·terrorist" label could be applied to indigenous guerrilla operations, 1novements for national liberation, foreign actions against despotic govem1nents or even legal strikes at home (Conway, 2002). The independent use of the term 'terroristn · - in any serious acade1nic study - should be based on a working definition informed by an exmnination of a n1ultitude of existing definitions, and should be achieved through a precise and clear wording intended to create a minimal level of uncertainty as to who the intended target of the particular definition is. Furthermore, when applying the ·terrorist" label in any serious examination of sub state or non-state activity, one must be 1nade aware that 1nany scholars ulti1nately view "terroristn' ·· ... as a political label rather than a meaningful research concept"' (Nassar, 2004, p.17) and that the term operates in domain which exists outside of the realm of legitimate academic study. Because 'terrorism' is a descriptor which so frequently works to the advantage of state actors - a signifier commonly employed to castigate certain sub state and non state groups for violent activities while exonerating the state frmn blame for similar deeds- its applicability to rational, academic discourse is questionable at best and it should therefore be used only in the context of the work of others. Taking into account pointed criticisms of the terrorism marker, traditional struggles in defining the term, its ambiguities and its abuse at the hands of authorities, it

17

should be clearly understood why this report refuses to use the term 'tenoristn on its own to connote any form of sub state or non state militant activity. Subjective and loaded, the 'tenoris1n · marker is not only contentious, but hazardous - when used itnproperly, the term can lead to dmnaging criticism frmn well established experts in the ·tcrrorisJn · field 3 , and - in my opinion - can ultimately discredit any acaden1ic study hoping to 1nake a serious exmnination of the extremist Islamist phenmnenon.

One must be selective when considering experts in the 'terrorism' or 'terrorology' field. This field has been criticized on the basis that- although it has been marked by the work of informed and noted scholars such as Walter Laqueur- it has also seen works by administratively inclined authors such as Benjamin Netanyahu.

VI. CYBERTERRORISM- FACT AND FANTASY A. Introduction

Defined by Denning (2000) as ""the convergence of terrorism and cyberspace .. (n.p.), the tenn ·cyberterroristn · represents the idea that extremist groups will leverage computer and information systems in order to provide a substantial attack on data networks, critical infrastructure and essential services (0-Day. 2004). Born out

uncertainties brought on by the networking of transportation syste1ns, public utilities, hmnes, businesses and educational institutions (Etnbar-Seddon, 2002), the

·cyberterrorisf concept presupposes the existence of groups or individuals whose proficiency with computer technologies will be coupled with a violent, political agenda to create a cyber nightmare (Lezner and Vardi, 2004) for Western institutions and citizens. In its suppositions of a world imperilled by vulnerable infrastructure, unchecked information systems and technologically adept insurgents, the idea of· cyberterroris1n · is both a potent propagandist vision as well a symbol of traditional, Western suspicions of the power afforded to subversive groups- especially extremist Islmnist organizations -by new technologies (Ehrlich and Dworzecka, 1998).
B. History

Coined in the 1980s by Barry Collin, senior research fellow at the Institute for Security and Intelligence in California (Conway, 2002), the "cyberterroristn' 1noniker first enters the public consciousness via depictions in popular culture. Formed in the
4

wake of early "hacking' incidents- the discovery of "phone phreaking· in the 1960's , the

just as the notion of

· cyberterroristn · is fennented in the imagination of the public. In the 1982 tihn 'Tron ·, a powerful super cmnputer remarks '"Do you have any idea how many outside systems rve gone into? I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week.'' (Disney, 1982). The entry of the 'cyberterrorism' concept into mainstremn thought soon follows. In 1991, contemporaneous to writer Winn Schwartu describing the prospect of an ·"electronic pearl harbour'' arising from the malicious use of infonnation technology (Schwartu, 1991 ), a report produced by the National Research Council entitled

Computers at Risk states, '"The modem thief can steal more with a cmnputer than a gun.
Tomorrow's terrorist may be able to do more damage with a keyboard than a bmnb.'' (National Research Council, 1991, p. 7). 'Cyberterrorism', allegedly tnade possible

through the linking of computer systems to the world-wide-web, suddenly etnerges as a threat on the agendas of national governments, security agencies, federal think tanks and computer experts (Conway, 2002). With journalists labelling the perceived risk frmn

malicious hackers a 'Cyber-war' (Hoffman, 1999, p.C1) or "Existential Terrorism· (Becher, n.d. ), and the alleged campaign to attack targets in and through cyberspace

being called a ·cyber Jihad· (Bunt, 2003), the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and InteJnational studies raises the spectre that ·cyberterrorism · could be exceptionally devastating for the Western world, stating - in a 1998 report - that the threat fr01n cyberterrorism represents no less than ""a Digital Waterloo .. (Centre for Strategic and Inten1ational Studies, 1998).

C.

Government and Media Depictions of Cyberterrorism
At present, "cyberterrorisin · is portrayed - by national governments - as '"the

darkest downside of the infonnation revolution'" (Arquilla, Ronfeldt and Zanini, 2000, po 179). Where state actors infer that "' ... the number of actors with the ability to utilize c01nputers for illegal, hannful and possibly devastating purposes is on the rise'' (fbi.gov, 2004, n.p.), and it is declared inevitable that malicious sub state and non state actorsnmnely extremist Islamist groups - will employ the internet as an offensive weapon (Zanini in Jones, 2004) the idea is surreptitiously pushed that networked attacks on Western infrastructure, services and information systems are i1n1ninent. The claim that
""It is only a matter of time before there is a convergence between those with hostile intent

and techno-savvy ..... (gwu.edu, 2000) underscores a mode thinking which suggests the necessity of preparing for a "· ... true cyber attack on information systems by terrorists" (Vatis in Kirkland, 2002, n.p.). Inferences that new modes of assault will be opened up to sub state and non state actors simultaneous with the advent of new technologies

( csis.gc.ca/enJpublications/perspectives/200 Ill. asp, 2002) are essential to lawmakers and national security agencies. Employing such inferences, state actors posit the potential of damaging 'cyber-attacks', instil - in public thought - the idea that subversive groups

gravitating toward new technologies will utilize such technologies solely for disruptive, destructive or deadly tneans, and facilitate the eventual n1ovetnent toward a greater an1ount of adtninistrative control over the online environment. Following the lead of national goven11nents, tnajor tncdia outlets also advance notions that attacks on tnajor facets of the industrialized world via the internet are an inherent possibility. Driven by a concentrated sphere of corporate ownership closely

aligned with elite interests (Hennan and Chmnsky, 1988), tnany media outlets reflect goven1mental views on the idea of ·cyberterroristn ·, inferring to mass audiences that ""disruptive cmnputer attacks that could result in injuries or deaths are no longer a tnatter of conjecture·' (Wallace, 2001, p.3A). The idea that ·"The unitnaginable is looking ever more plausible"' (Lezner and Vardi, 2004, p. 70) is indicative of the way in which clements of the media view the 'lomning threaf of '"cyberterrorism ~. Cyber attacks are broadcast by the tnedia as an inescapable reality, a phenomenon guaranteed to '"strike at the heart of any Western economy.. (Ellsmore, 2002). State and corporate actors heavily etnphasize the possibility of "cyberterrorist' attacks, in the process parlaying a vision of an information technology future dominated by increasing assaults on critical infrastructure, essential services and the internet itself. Seeking to shape public perception of the threat level represented by "cyberterrorism', state and corporate actors suggest that it is necessary to expect - given the history of the malicious use of information technology
7 -

that sub state and non state actors will make

use of information technology in the future to inflict dmnage, financial ruin and significant casualties on sections of the industrialized world (Weimann, 2006).
Vegh (2002) has suggested that computer hacking- which has a relatively benign but fairly lengthy history- has been historically viewed as inseparable, in many government and security circles (such as the American NSA) from cyberterrorism.

D.

Reality of Cyberterrorism Threat
In their strong etnphasis of the 'cybertenorisf threat state and corporate actors

not only create cunents of disinfonnation which blur the distinction between ·cybertenorisin · and other forms of networked activity -~ such as ·hacktivisin .x (Vegh, 2002), but also problc1natize the public· s understanding of the extent to which ·cyberterrorisin · actually affects daily life (Lia, 2005). With the reality present that a 1najor act of ·cyberterrorism' has yet to happen (Conway, 2002), and the claim that cybertenorist incidents currently hover at zero per annum (Poulsen, 2001 ), postulations of cybertenoris1n as an endangennent to the functionality of Western life begin to appear questionable and unconvincing. Smne have infened that the alleged threat posed by "cyberterrorism' may be significantly less than what state and corporate discourse on the matter would suggest. While Lia (2005) posits the unlikelihood of substate and nonstate actors attacking infrastructural targets through cyberspace, Jones (2005) forwards the idea that ··Mounting an attack against computers systetns is beyond the skills of tenorists"' (p.5). Journalist Lee Gomes sees · cyberterroris1n · as "'More marketing ploy than a real threat'" (200 1, p. B 1). And Dorothy Denning, professor in the Depart1nent of Defense Analysis at the
9

Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, intimates that "Not only does cyberterrorism not rank alongside che1nical, biological, or nuclear weapons, but it is not anywhere near as serious as other potential physical threats like car bombs or suicide bombers." (in Green, 2002, p.9).
8

Hacktivism can be thought of as the confluence of 'hacking' and activism or 'hacking' for political means. See http://thehacktivist.com/hacktivism.php. 9 A 2001 study found that 75 percent oflnternet users worldwide believed 'cyberterrorists' would soon '' ... inflict massive casualties on innocent lives by attacking corporate and governmental computer networks'" (Poulsen, 2001, n.p.).

23

I

·------1

Countering dmninant assertions about · cybe1ienoris1n · by the 1najority of state and corporate actors, 1nany view the phenon1enon as an ""unlikely threat"" (Lewis in Clarke, 2004, p.l48) to the physical world. Richard Clarke, fonner Cyber-security

advisory to U.S. President George Bush, ad1nits, in 2002 ...... we have not seen the traditional tenorist groups using cyberspace for 1nalicious, offensive activity'" (Mogull, 2002), indicating a growing wariness of the concepfs usage even mnong smne administrative interests. As opposed to an i1n1ninent threat to Western infrastructure, services and citizens, ·cybertenoristn' would be better thought of as an ""alannist vision ... useful in order to mobilize public opinion and political wilr· ( Lia, 2005, p. 17 4 ). An as-of-yet unrealized tear propagated by federal goven11nents and the tnedia, the spectre of ··cybertenorism" instils apperceptions of imminent "cyberattacks · in the 1ninds of global publics (Poulsen, 200 I) and leads to the conception of scenarios in which infrastructural dmnage, internet failures and wide scale loss of life all figure prmninently. This has the effect of leading

to suneptitious calls for a higher level of online policing and - as will be detailed lateraids in "'preparing the ground for an attetnpt a at bureaucratic empire-building via internet regulation'' (Conway in Clarke, 2004. p. 181 ). State and corporate actors in their exploitation of the "cyberterrorism'

phenomenon - not only infer that new technologies can only be used for disruptive or destructive means by militant sub state groups, but mask an understanding of the true use that extremist groups make of the internet every day (Weimann, 2006 ). As the following section will demonstrate, far from utilizing infonnation technologies for disruptive or destructive means, extremist Islamist groups are making use of the internet in innovative

24

I

and self-beneficial ways, in the process creating an environment which eschews the idea of "'cybcrterrorism .. and leads us to believe that an active. IT infrastructure is much more beneficial to extretnist Islamist groups than a one destroyed by incessant ·cybcr-attacks·.

25

VII. The Extremist Islamist use of the Internet A. Introduction

An understanding of the degree to which extren1ist Islatnist organizations have becmne '"technologically sophisticated·· (Walters, 2005, p.ll) presently penneates discourse on the subject of 'technology and extretnisin· (Clarke, 2004). Fanned partially as a reaction to the perception - by state and corporate actors - of extremist Islamist groups as ..... backward looking ... anti-science and anti-technology"· (Tre1nayne, 2006, p.l ), this new recognition of extretnist Islamist technological proficiency sees journalists, acade1nics and adtninistrative interests coming to accept that extren1ist Islamist groups have become '"'"adept at ustng 1nodern technology for their own ends··

(http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2004/issue3/english/military.html). The understanding of extremist Islmnist groups as amicable to new technologies posits the ability of these collectives to adapt to new innovations such as cell phones, laptop computers and digital video cmneras (Clarke, 2004) and recognizes "'a decidedly
unpri1nitive~~

(Booth and

Dunne, 2002, p. 298) use of technologies by such groups. Popular perceptions of Osama Bin Laden carrying around a satellite phone with which to facilitate intra-organization communications are significant - the penetration of this media-reinforced itnage into the public imagination demonstrates a growing recognition of the link between extremist Islamist organizations and advanced technologies. As journalists, academics and administrative interests build an understanding of the significance of new innovations to extremist Islamist groups, a parallel understanding of how the internet has become a technology of paramount importance to such organizations is fanned. Said to be initially seen - by extremist Islamist groups such as

26

Hamas and Hizballah - as offering a '"level playing field" with the West (Nacos, 2006, p.228). the internet is employed by such organizations prior the awareness of the international cmnn1unity (Gunaratna 2003, p.1 03). Moving '"from physical space to

cyberspace·· (Coli and GlasseL 2005, AO I), extretnist Islamist organizations tnigrate to the net in significant nun1bers - by 2000, virtually all extremist Islamist groups have '"established their presence on the internet"" (Weimann, 2004, p.2). organizations begin to leverage the Extremist Islamist

internet '"for perception management and

propaganda·· (Zanini in Jones, 2004, p.l67), and in the process prove the internet to be a tool through which previously unrealized goals - namely the transnational extension of their reach- can be met (Wei1nann, 2006).

B.

Decentralization
At present, the internet is seen as attractive to extretnist Islamist groups primarily

due to its decentralized nature (Galloway, 2004). A network made up of interconnected con1puter networks, lacking a central adtninistration and based on the omni-directional as opposed to vertical - tnovement of data (Preston, 2004), the internet allows extre1nist Islmnist groups to share information in methods which bypasses state and corporate control (Arquilla, Ronfeldt and Zanini, 2000). As many extre1nist Islamist organizations have adopted the "leaderless resistance· principle in which small cells lacking a central command conduct operations independent of each other (Weimann, 2006), the internet provides a unifying structure which permits cells of such organizations to communicate, network and organize while remaining fluid and independent (Arquilla, Ronfeldt and Zanini, 2000). Preparations for the September 11th hijackings, in which a senes of independent agents ""used the internet and used it weir' (Dick 1n Conway, 2002) to

27

I '

com1nunicate, organize and plan for a series of large-scale attacks, are indicative of the extent to which the internet allows decentralized organizations to function in a networked 1nanner. The internet has changed extren1ist Islamist networks ··frmn those of strong, central control to ones with no clear centre of contror· (Jones, 2004, p. 141 ).
It has

allowed for the decentralization of extren1ist lslamist operations, and in the process has led such groups to becmne 1nore fluid and independent. The "'"network of networks .. has been beneficial in other ways to such groups, however. In order to better grasp the ways in which extremist Islan1ist organizations profit frmn the internet, the following exploration will exmnine some of the 1nost significant areas of extretnist Islamist internet usage.

C.

Con1munication and Organization
Extremist Islamist organizations - first and fore1nost - 1nake use of the inten1et

··as a tool for intra-group com1nunications .. (Lewis in Clarke, 2004, p.148). Operating independently of one another, often over long distances and across remote terrain (Gunaratna, 2002), extremist lslmnist groups use the internet to share '"'"cmnplex information ... over a geographically dispersed area·· (Anderson in Clarke, 2004, p.l58) and to provide a high level of intra-organizational contact. Utilizing the internet,

Extre1nist Islan1ist organizations benefit from an increased ability to quickly disseminate large amounts of data and are able to 1naintain quantitatively improved communications within their organizational structures (Weimann, 2006). The purported, internet-based communications between Iraqi insurgent Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and the 'Al-Qaeda' network prior to his 2006 death demonstrate the degree to which the internet has

28

I
t

facilitated '""more dialogue between me1nbers .. (Zanini and Edwards in Arquilla and Ronfeldt, 200 I, p. 36) of extremist Islamist organizations. These com1nunications are said to have helped in the delivery of communiques and orders to Zarqawi, ultimately leading to a solidification of the · Al-Qacda in Iraq· leadership structure (Brisard, 2005). Extre1nist Islamist organizations also utilize the inten1et to communicate to potential supporters. Understanding the i1nportance - to operational success - of

tnobilizing bases of popular suppmi (Tun1an, 2003 ), extremist Islmnist groups reach out to followers and agreeable publics through the use of websites, chat rooms and online databases. In addition to authorizing websites which tnerchandise t-shirts, f1ags, badges, videos and audio-cassettes to interested parties (Weimann, 2006), extremist Islamist groups leverage the internet to provide sympathetic audiences with text and imagery designed to affect their sensibilities (Lia, 2005, p. 175). Extremist Islamist groups

com1nunicate current activities, struggles and successes to allies through the internet and draw supporters into their daily operations in the process (Yagil, 2002). The extremist Islmnist use of the internet for the purpose of communicating with international, 'enemy publics· is also worth noting (Weimann, 2004). As the internet

provides extremist Islamist groups with a way to reach mass audiences (Nacos, 2006) coupled with ""direct control over the content of their message'' (Zanini in Jones, 2004, p.

168), such groups can broadcast potentially uncensored text, images and video to
international viewers. According to Wei1nann (2006 ), it is often unclear whether or not extremist Islmnist cmnmunications via the web are destined for hostile populations, although many extremist Islamist websites do feature English language sections of their sites as well as easily accessible - often graphic - footage and imagery intended to reach

29

an enetny audience. In May of 2004

~

for exan1ple - an extren1ist Islmnist website hosted

a video featuring the beheading of American contractor Nicholas Berg. Accmnpanying this video, a headline read, "Sheik Abu Musab Zarqawi slaughters an American infidel with his hands and promises Bush n1ore·· (Filkins et aL 2004), a n1essage clearly intended to reach
~-

and to

intimidate~

a foreign populace.

D.

Recruitment and Indoctrination
Bruce HofT1nan (2004) has indicated that the longevity of 1nilitant organizations is

based partially on their ""ability to recruit, to 1nobilize and to animate both actual and would-be fighters, supporters and sytnpathizers·· (p. 8). Factual if we consider the cases of Palestine's 'PFLP" 10 and Peru's "Shining Path" 11 , Hoffi11an"s line ofthought appears to be shared by many extremist Islamist organizations. Where traditional methods of recruitlnent are probletnatized through physical distance and external disruption (Gunaratna, 2002), extre1nist Islmnist groups turn to the internet to draw the attention of willing individuals toward their organizations (Yagil, 2002). Over the internet, extremist Islamist organizations facilitate a virtual environment for the indoctrination of 1nembers into their groups (Yagil, 2002), ··recruit and 1nobilize supporters to play a more active role in (their) activities or causes"" (Reynalds, 2006) and ultimately ""bridge the gap from the isolated potential 1nujahed to the global jihad'' (Sageman, 2004, p.l63 ). Extremist Islamist organizations provide access to ""thousands

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) is a Marxist-Leninist, anti-Israeli militant organization formed in 196 7. It gained notoriety in the 1960's and 1970's for several high profile aircraft hijackings but is now an organization largely secondary to other militant groups such as Hamas due to declining membership.

of books, articles, con11nuniques and fatwas·· (Lia, 2005, p. 175) for the benefit of potential recruits. They also facilitate large. online databases catering to interested

supporters. The introduction to an · al Qaeda · training n1anual - published on the internet in 2004 - states the following: "Because many of Islam's young people do not yet know how to bear anns, not to tnention use thetn, and because the agents of the Cross are hobbling the Muslitns and preventing them from planning for the sake of Allah - your brothers the Mujahideen in the Arabian Peninsula have decided to publish this (online) booklet to serve the Mujahid brother in his place of isolation ... " (worldnetdaily.com, 2004, n.p. ). Some have suggested that - in addition to ""seeking convetis ustng the full panoply of web site technologies .. (Weitnann, 2006, p. 11 R), extrernist Islatnist organizations may also use clandestine means to recruit potential 1ne1nbers. Such

organizations could - for example - "note which type of propaganda receive the most browser hits'" and resultantly ""tailor a n1essage for a particular audience'· (Zanini in
1ones, 2004, p. 168). These suggestions don ·t appear to carry much weight, but are worth

considering due to the influx of data 1nining and other web surveillance technologies easily available over the internet. Ultimately, statements which posit the internet as the "ideal recruiting tool· for extremist Islamist organizations (Ariza, 2006) are predicated on the perception of the internet as open, disorganized and "chaotic·. Because the inten1et is viewed as a largely unregulated forum in which activists can anonymously converse, share information and collaborate (Van de Donk et al, 2004), authors, researchers and journalists postulate the ease with which extremist Islamist organizations utilize cyberspace to extend their reach to potential members, to bring new individuals into their organizational structures and to

31

I

foster an enviromnent in which recruiting for their causes can proceed ··unabated·· (Ariza. 2006).

E.

Virtual Community Building
In his 2000 book, "Virtually Islmnic", author Gary Bunt wonders to what extent

the virtual cmnmunities

12

of the internet- specifically those communities populated by

citizens of the Islatnic faith- have become transcendent formns blurring the realities of actual, physical life. Viewing cyberspace as an abstract, illusory world with the potential of itnplanting artificial perceptions in participants, he questions whether or not the inten1et has developed into an "electronic space casting Islam in an idealized light"" (p.l) and attempts to gauge the ramifications of such a possibility. Interesting if we consider that extremist Islamist groups are said to be creating ''virtual sanctuaries'' (O'Brien in Jones, 2004. p. 141) for their activities on the world-wide web, Bunf s queries shift our attention to the part that the internet is potentially playing in giving rise to an idealized space for extremist Islamist activities. Smne postulate that chat rooms, bulletin boards and other interactive formns of the internet may be fertile ground for the development of virtual cmnrnunities '"just, egalitarian, full of opportunity, unified in an Islam purged of national peculiarities and devoid of corruption, exploitation and persecution" (Sageman, 2004, p. 161 ). Absent the physical bonds and face to face contact characteristic of real life experience, virtual communities may provide extremist Islamist groups with a social space in which to create idealized and slanted interpretations of the Islamic faith, may allot such groups a platform on which to "glorify the heroes and martyrs of the movement's cause" (Nacos, 2006, p.

Virtual communities are communities in which participants communicate and interact primarily through the use ofiT, and in which face-to-face communications are infrequent and rare. (Rheingold, 1993).

230) and could potentially give such bTfOups a tnodule with which to push participants
toward the attainment of unrealistic and unattainable goals. The notion of an · extretnist Islamist virtual public sphere' has- in my opinion not been properly addressed in literary works dealing with the topic of extremist Islamist activity on the internet. A further exploration of this facet of extremist Islmnist inten1et usage is probably warranted in the future, not only because of its absence in the literature, but even more so due to the fact that it tnay be the creation of idealized virtual communities- by extretnist Islmnist groups- which allows the facilitation of other aspects of extretnist Islan1ist internet usage.

F.

Conclusions
Ultimately, extretnist Islamist groups - having become technologically proficient

in the use of NICT. s - employ these technologies for various purposes. While extre1nist Islmnist groups facilitate communication and organization through the data-transfer capabilities of the internet, they also utilize the World Wide Web, chat groups and online databases to reach potential supporters and recruits. Employing the internet to fonn

egalitarian and corruption-free 'virtual communities', extremist Islmnist groups build idealized versions of real-life societies, and exhort members and followers to achieve unrealistic and largely unattainable goals in the life-world. And making use of the

internet's distributed structure, extremist Islmnist groups remain in close contact and ""accomplish everything they need to do together without ever being co-present in the same location'" (Baba in Hyland et al, 2005, p. 120). The internet - in its complex and multi-faceted nature - has allowed extremist Islamist groups to remain functional in a world where they face significant challenges to

33

their daily operations. It has given such groups a way to overcmne physical obstacles, to
13 build and grow. and to expand into areas of the world - such Great Britain -

where a

strong, Islmnist presence was previously not evident.

Utilizing the inten1et, extre1nist

Islmnist groups have been able to create a visible, online presence for themselves around the world, and 1nore importantly, have raised the profile of the "extre1nist Islmnist e1nployn1ent of the inten1ef to the point where it has becmne a legitimate - and significant- area of study.

Britain is home to the Finsbury Park Mosque in which controversial (and now jailed) imam Abu Hamza al-Masri preached regularly (bbc.co.uk. 2006) Muslim Cleric Omar Bakri Muhammad- who until 2005 resided in Britain- is quoted as stating "the life of an unbeliever has no value. It has no sanctity." (theage.com.au, 2004).

VIII. THE PROJECT A. Intent of project

At the outset n1y project was intended to identify a series of extretnist Islamist websites operating in Canadian webspace, to plot the location of these websites (based on the geographical position of the registrars, service providers or datacenters hosting them) on an interactive tnap, and to track the disappearance, reappearance or change in physical location of any of these sites over a period of two months. During the two month period of observation, the intention was also tnade to take note of the layout of the chosen websites sites and to track significant changes in content and format, although this idea was later dropped due to the difficulty of interpreting site contents and due to the fact that initial scans of the websites in my project revealed such sites as having little relevancein tenns of content- to the Canadian state. The reasoning behind this project was twofold. Firstly, it was considered

itnperative to demonstrate - to students, academics and researchers - the presence of extretnist Islmnist websites within Canadian webspace. Noting claims that Canada has becotne potential target" for extremist Islmnist activity

(csis.gc.ca/en/newsroom/backgrounders, 2002) and that extremist Islamist groups have begun to set up operations on Canadian soil (Bell, 2004), there was a perceived need to provide a visual representation of any extremist Islamist websites being serviced by Canadian internet cmnpanies. The alleged, plot - by a group of ""like-minded Islamists" (Van Rijn, 2006, n.p.)- to attack various Canadian targets in June of2006 was claimed to have been internet-facilitated, and thus the timing was correct for a project which would

35

I

explore the atms of extretnist Islmnist groups being serviced by Canadian inten1et cmnpamcs. Secondly, there was a desire to present interested parties- scholars, students and academics - with an easy way to conceive of the scope of extretnist Islamist websites operating under Canadian internet companies. With prelitninary research indicating that no attempt had yet been tnade to geographically chart extre1nist Islan1ist websites active in Canadian webspace, and noting that a visual representation of active, extremist Islmnist websites would be 1nore effective than - for example - a si1nple written description of the placetnent of these sites, it was decided to choose a format which would privilege the visual over the written.
It was hoped that the format chosen for this initiative - the idea of presenting

extremist Islamist websites (active in Canadian web space) in a visual, geographically placed fashion - would provoke a high level of inquisition and discussion. As the topic of extre1nist Islmnist activity within Canada is currently highly debated, and as the recognition is emerging that extre1nist Islamist groups are making use of the internet for various purposes on a global scale, it was felt that this project could possibly ignite a debate over the reasons behind why extremist Islmnist websites are or might not be operating in Canadian web space. The aim of this project was not to be contentious perse, but as it was believed that a certain level of debate would lead to possible elucidations regarding the existence of extre1nist Islamist websites in Canadian webspace, it was felt that the format chosen for the project was correct. Ultimately, the real reason behind the development of this project was not to investigate the aims of, methods utilized by and benefits incurred by extremist Islamist

36

groups using the internet - this had already been done in depth, notably by W ein1ann (2006), Nacos (2004), Last (2005) and others. The real value in this project was to

present metnbers of the public- natnely students and ordinary citizens- with a first look at the extension, to Canadian webspace, of the extremist Islatnist phen01nenon, a phen01nenon which has spread onto the internet in recent years, making its presence felt on a global scale.

B.

Method of Pre-Preparation
Prior to the commence1nent of this projecf s observation phase, a senes of

extretnist Islatnist websites operating in Canadian webspace had to be identified. The idea was undertaken to make use of the 'tracking terroristn.com ·, "Internet Haganah'

and 'siteinstitute.org · websites, three sites with major databases pertaining to extre1nist lslamist websites. Using the ·'Who Is'' search engine, located at www.whois.org, dozens of sites listed in the databases of these sites were scanned for ownership. The result was the discovery that 32 extre1nist, Islamist websites were registered, hosted or given datacentre space by Canadian internet companies. After this initial phase was done, I could successful 1nove onto the next phase, the actual plotting of the sites on an interactive map.

C.

Plotting of sites and use of Google Earth
After the initial period of pre-preparation which identified a series of extremist

Islamist websites being serviced by Canadian internet companies, the choice was made to plot the found sites on Google Earth, an interactive mapping program said to be able to provide "high-resolution satellite i1nagery of 20 percent of the Earth's surface'' (Claburn, 2006, p. 18). Google Earth was chosen on the basis of it being dynamic, user-friendly

37

and flexible. As well, Google Earth represented an evolving platform - it was felt that, if this project was to continue past the end of the allotted two 1nonth observation period, it could potentially benefit from future technical additions to the Google Earth progrmn. Using Googlc earth would otTer the potential of sharing this project with a global audience, and would provide a way to allow users a direct view of extre1nist Isla1nist website activity within Canadian Inten1et companies. The plotting process began by looking up the geographic addresses of the Canadian internet cmnpanies providing services to the found sites. This was done easily by cxmnining the company websites themselves.

Appendix A lists the names and

addresses of Canadian inten1et cmnpanies found to be providing services to extre1nist Islamist websites. After this, the physical addresses of these companies were noted, and - using several online tnaps- matches were made between the companies and their actual

The dynamic map in Google Earth was referenced with these

1natches. 'Placetnarks' indicating the physical location of respective Canadian internet co1npanies hosting extretnist Islmnist websites were then plotted in Google Earth.

Relevant infonnation was included with each placemark, such as the name of the website, its group affiliation (for exmnple, Hmnas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, etc), and the datacenter, service provider and hosting company servicing it. Where applicable, an in1age from the site itself was also linked to provide the viewer with a quick siteidentifier. Google Earth was beneficial in these regards because it provided a dynmnic way of having a text box
appear~

when clicking on placemarks - which would allow the

viewer to sec all infonnation about the chosen websites.

Overall, Google Earth was deemed the right program to use for this project. While its public display capabilities provided potential viewers with an easy visualization of the scope of extre1nist Islamist websites operating in Canadian webspace, its server capabilities 15 and ease of tnanipulation were of great benefit to my aims, and showed promise for the possibility of this project being easily transferred to a more in-depth researcher in the future.

The observation phase of 1ny project formally co1n1nenced after the plotting of the 32 extremist lslamist wcbsites- found during the pre-preparation stage of this initiativeon the Google Emih Map. I had expected, prior to the beginning of the project, to find many more sites operating in Canadian webspacc, but the realization that 32 cxtre1nist Islmnist wcbsites were being serviced by Canadian intcn1ct companies was significant in and of itself Sites affiliated with Islmnist groups AI Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Hamas,

Hizballah and Hizb ut-Tahrir were all found and plotted- Appendix B lists these groups and their respective backgrounds. By week two of this project, I began to sec the first evidence of site Inoveinent, as several observed sites went ot11ine. While two sites in tny study becan1e inactive in this week, a third was replaced with an error message possibly indicating that the site administrator had been locked out. Two other sites now re-directed to another site as well. Appendix 0 lists the results of week 2 of my study. Week three of the project saw one additional site disappear, bringing the total of sites having disappeared since the start of the observation period to four. However,

another site also appeared in week three - this site was discovered through an additional cxmnination of the databases at the Internet Haganah website. This meant that the total nmnber of active sites- in my study- re1nained at 29. At this point, I began to wonder chiefly why Tucows Ltd. of Toronto was providing registration services to so 1nany sites, as by the third week, 15 sites were active under the services ofTucows. Appendix E lists the results of week three of 1ny study. Week four saw the disappearance of a site that had appeared only a week earlier, but also saw the reappearance of two other sites which had previously disappeared. This

40

-I

brought the total number of sites active in my study back up to 30. I began to question postulations
~

by experts such as Weitnann (2004)

~

about the rapid fluctuation of

extremist Islamist websites. If such sites were frequently moving from server to server to avoid being shut down, or continually going on and ot1line for various reasons (Weimann, 2004 ). tny expectation at this point was that I should have already witnessed this phenon1enon. Instead. I was witnessing a series of sites which appeared to remain static. Appendix F lists the results of week four of tny study. Week six of 1ny study followed a disappointing week five in which nothing of significance had happened. In week six, I again noticed the movement of sites, as two tnore extretnist Islamist websites becmne inactive. In this week, an interesting tum of events saw two sites change direction- the ikhwan.net and al-Inultaqa.net sites no longer re-directed to www.hassanalbana.org- instead, al-multaqa.net and hassanalbana.org now re-direct to ikhwan.net. This was probably due to site ownership - my postulation here was that several different dmnain nmnes had likely been registered by the smne group so that, in the event of one site being shut down, information could quickly be moved to another site. Appendix H lists the results of week six of my study. Week seven of 1ny study saw another new site come online. This site was again found through searches of new sites listed in the Internet Haganah database. This meant that there were 29 sites in total still active in tny study. Appendix I lists the results for week seven of 1ny study. At week eight - the final week of my study - two 1nore sites becmne inactive. This meant that- at the end of my observation period, while there were seven sites which were not operational, 27 total sites remained active. I had expected - at the outset of my

41

I

project - to see a much larger fluctuation of sites. As welL I had anticipated the rapid movernent of sites between different servers - what occurred was well below my expectations. Nonetheless, I saw this as significant - these results alone were to infonn smne of the conclusions of my project. Appendix J lists the results for week 8 of my study.

E.

l\1akeup of Observed Sites
During the initial planning stages of this project, the question arose as to how to

accurately connect alleged extrernist Islmnist websites with their purportedly associated groups.
16

Challenging and thought provoking, this question becmne one requiring a

critical level of attention. With the integrity of this project largely dependent upon the precise designation of a series of websites as ·extremist Islamisf and with the knowledge present of a possible rnargin of error concerning the proper identification of found sites
17 ,

a method of determining the association between uncovered websites and related extremist Islamist groups was deemed i1nperative.
It was decided that the best way to cetnent the relationship between found sites

and their suspected authors would be - firstly - through a research process revealing identifiers (emblems, color schetnes, statements) common to the groups in this study. The signs, symbols and aesthetic preferences of organizations such as Hizballah and Hamas would be noted, their various stances on issues and important statements taken into account. This would be followed by a thorough examination of the sites in this study to see if the imagery, colors and tenninology used on such sites bore any relation to the
16

Relying solely on outside sources to positively identify active, extremist Islamist websites was deemed inappropriate for this study- to cement the relationship between suspected websites and their alleged authors, a more in depth level of investigation was necessary. 17 One of the primary questions initially asked- by observers of this project- concerned the possible misidentification of ordinary. Arabic-language websites as Islamist in orientation.

42

I

conventions utilized by their allegedly associated organizations.

Finally, site contents

would be recorded based on a standard set of criteria, and comparisons would be made by cross referencing positively-identified extre1nist Islmnist websites against sites affiliated with sin1ilar groups. Following this method, it was believed that not only would a greater level of assurance regarding proper website identification be
achieved~

but that as well,

coininon threads unifying the different websites of singular groups would be seen. The following section details the last part of the process described above, with special emphasis on common imagery, color sche1ne and tenninology threads running through si1nilarly affiliated sites. E.l Imagery At the adjournment of the website content investigation phase of this project, it was firstly concluded that the sites observed in this study could be positively 1natched to their allegedly affiliated groups through identifying imagery. Possessing splash banners bearing group logos, pi-ctures and diagrams intended for identifiable audiences and photographs appearing as almost endemic to specific interpretations of Islamist extre1nism, many of the sites surveyed in the context of this initiative pictorially reflected the authorship of particular, extre1nist Islamist organizations. One of the primary types of observed imagery aiding in the proper designation of found sites during this initiative came in the form of group crests or emblems. Displaying logos identical - or similar to- official logos used by groups such as Al-Aqsa and Hizballah, the majority of the websites investigated during this project provided clear, outward signifiers of group orientation and ownership. The majority of Hizb utTahrir websites, for example, displayed the characteristic black flag with white lettering

43

sytnbolic of that group, while most sites allegedly affiliated with Han1as were tnarked with a variation on that
group~s

ot1icial insignia.

Logos. crests and emblems were

generally etnbedded in colourful and itnage-rich banners located at the top of the intro page of n1ost websites in this study; this cmnbination was likely intended to instil - in target audiences- an immediate understanding of site at1iliation and authenticity. Revealing photographs also acted as markers tying numerous sites in this study to their suspected owners. Featuring images strongly reflecting the operational n1andates of allegedly affiliated groups, the majority of websites exmnined in this initiative provided clear, pictorial evidence linking them to specific, extretnist Islamist beliefs. operations and actions. Supposed sites of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs· Brigades, containing photographic combinations of important personalities 18 , known martyr~ and Palestinian militants brandishing rocket propelled grenades, were complimented in this study by the apparent web pages of Hizb ut-Tahrir, whose sites provided images of group-related tneetings, protests and demonstrations. Websites linked with Hmnas - a group whose pritnary

operations are directed towards the funding of educational institutions, health centres and similarly-related charity projects - were unsurprisingly adorned with itnages of schools, hospitals and community centres under construction. And a host of independent sites in this study featured images of armaments, Islamist militants, anti-Israeli etnblems and other related elements, all of which acted as indicators of such sites being tied to the operations of known, extremist Islamist groups.

E.2

Color Scheme
Another interesting conclusion made at the adjournment of the website content

investigation phase of this project was that the majority of sites investigated in this study
18

Of these personalities, Y asser Arafat figured prominently. Al Aqsa is a known aHiliate of Hamas.

44

could be connected to their allegedly affiliated groups through cmnmonly-occurring color schemes. As it had been observed - through prior research - that most groups included in this study used specific color combinations as a hallmark of their public identities
19 ,

it

followed that such colors would be evident and recurring among many of the websitcs of such groups. Websites indicated - by outside organizations such as Internet Haganah - to be connected with extretnist Islamist groups were generally constructed in colors resetnbling those found in group logos, pictorials or communication-related materials. Suspected

Hizb ut-Tahrir websites, for example, often appeared in the black and white of that group· s official insignia, while the majority of Ham as websites were tnade up of the Green, red, white and black typifying both the official logo - and the association with the Palestinian state - of that group. In many cases, it appeared that color acted both as a signifier seizing the attention of target audiences as well as a visual device tying certain websites to a specific struggle- it was expected that the latter supposition would be given 1nore weight by the eventual discovery and examination of a much larger amount of sites affiliated with groups seen in this study.

E.3

Written Materials
One of the most significant findings of the website exmnination phase of this

initiative concerned the identification of written materials -

articles, pamphlets,
Google~ s

statements - largely specific to certain extremist Islamist organizations. Using

free translation utility, as well as the Multi-Translate utility developed by S ystran\f:, basic translations of the written contents of many observed sites were made- these translations were to reveal identifying terminology linking found sites to their supposedly affiliated
19

groups.

While it was assmned that tnuch of the writing and tenninology found on

specific sites would be present on the websites of various, disassociated extremist Islamist groups, smne tenninology was group-specific enough to tnerit attention. Atnong sites alleged to belong to the AI Aqsa Martyr·s brigade, atiicles concerning the itnportance of martyrdom were complitnented by calls for tnilitant activities. One loosely translated phrase on a suspected Al Aqsa site indicated that ·" 100 Martyrs are ready to attack the depth of the Zionists", while another, sitnilarly affiliated site adorned photographs of deceased AI Aqsa members with glorifying descriptions of their individual sacrifices, many of which appeared related to suicide attacks. Sites

clain1ed to be affiliated with Hamas contained textual references to initiatives undertaken in relation to schools and other charities - one site claimed to work on behalf of all Palestinians, ""Especially the families of martyrs and prisoners, orphans and students of science and needy families."' And along with writing concerning the dissolution of the Khilafah and articles proclaiming the need for the establishment of a worldwide caliphate, numerous Hizb ut-Tahrir related sites contained phrases calling for attacks on the West (an article found on one site states "'We ask God Almighty to make the massive destruction.,) attacks on Israel and other, related militant activities. Ultitnately, the translation of written materials was an important key to drawing an association between found sites and their suspected authors. Through the conversion to English of written documents, familiar terms, phrases and idimns could be identified and linked to modus operandi of specific groups, and allegations of site ownership could be further bolstered. Contributing much to the verification of site identity, the

translations methods used herein, however basic, proved invaluable - It was expected that

46

the inclusion in future endeavours of better translation Inethods along with the possible expansion of this project to include a greater number of observed websites would in tun1 produce tnore textual proof of site ownership.

E.4

Conclusions
A thorough inspection of many sites involved m this study revealed cmnmon

identifiers which - when cross referenced against the signs and symbols of extretnist Islamist groups investigated in this initiative - helped to bolster links between observed virtual spaces and their alleged possessors. UEdertaking a research process combining a knowledge of the traits of extretnist Islamist groups with an empirical analysis of websites purported to belong to such organizations, it was found that - at the same titne as laying the foundation for a method of verifying extremist Islamist website authenticity - co1n1non t!1reads between similarly affiliated sites were being uncovered. Very tnuch for the infusion of an understanding of site affiliation into potential audiences, cmnmon identifiers may help to draw in interested individuals, while common threads may serve to provide a unified front for organizations with many, geographically dispersed factions. This may ultimately lead to visions - in sympathetic audiences - of stronger, larger, globally organized and cohesive extremist Islamist organizations. Future research endeavours - including possible audience impact surveys -will no doubt detennine the impact that extremist Islamist groups are having on potential audiences - it is possible that extremist Islamist organizations may, through the makeup of their various sites, be very much geared toward seizing the attention and the sympathies of mnicable publics.

Conclusions about observation phase of Project
At the adjoun11nent of the observation phase of this project, I was disappointed at

what I viewed as a lack of high-yield results 20 . Against tny predictions ~ informed by writers such as Weimann (2006) and Last (2005) - that observed websites would appear and disappear or change registrars, servers or datacentres on a weekly basis to avoid being shut down, most sites in this study changed very little in terms of their ISP location. The fact that 27 sites out of an initial total of 32 were still active at the end of tny study detnonstrated a failure to anticipate the immobility of extremist Islamist websites operating in Canadian webspace and indicated that certain other measures might have been taken prior to the study, such as the possible extension of this project to include the majority of North American webspace, as well as the inclusion of a wider number of groups in the projecf s observation phase. A lack of dratnatic results in this study did not

preclude the

possibility that some important postulations could be made regarding the behaviour of the observed, extretnist Islamist websites. The following conclusions, drawn from an

examination of prior, extremist Islamist activity on the internet and exten1al responses to this activity, were conceived out of a necessity of clarifying a phenomenon which retnains

other sites which would themselves disappear.

It was anticipated that, as Canadian

security and policing agencies would not allow barred extremist Islamist groups to 1nake usc of Canadian wcbspace, a rapid closure of sites would be seen. The fact that this result did not occur and that very few observed websites went offline during the observation phase of 1ny project is thus significant. This could - firstly - be attributed to the alleged difficulties associated with online regulation and control. The internet - viewed by smne as extre1nely difficult to regulate due to its decentralized nature (M.J ., 1996), is often concurrently cited as being a medium which '"does not allow for effective censorship against terrorism .. (Lia, 2005, p.195). The clai1n that "terrorist activity online is hard to track down" (Lal, 2003, n.p.) underscores suppositions of a cyberspace beyond the realm of significant administrative control- this mode of thinking places subversive groups at the centre of sphere considered conducive to the anonymous activities of a range of substate and non-state actors. Taking the alleged difficulties associated with inten1et regulation into

consideration, it is possible that - in the context of this study - the mnbiguous nature of the internet proved conducive to the observed, extretnist Islamist websites staying online. Many of the web sites observed in this study may have avoided being shut down out of an inability, or an unwillingness - on the part of Canadian law enforcement - to regulate them. As it is thought by many to be '"'"difficult for hacktivists and governments alike to banish from the Net content they deem offensive.. (Conway, 2002, n.p.), Canadian lawmakers, such as CSIS and the RCMP, may have considered - assuming their knowledge of the existence of the sites of observed in this study- the majority of online, extremist Islamist forums operational in Canadian webspace 'not worth shutting down'.

49

I

The fact that so few sites went ot1line during the observation phase of n1y project n1ight also suggest that policing and security agencies in Canada prefer to keep tnost extremist Islamist websites online, as opposed to taking thetn down. Despite broad new powers allowing Canadian security and law enforcement agencies control over content housed by Canadian internet companies 22 , organizations like CSIS and the RCMP may have wished tnany of the observed websites to retnain active and tnay thus have limited the retnoval of these websites from the databanks of Canadian ISPs. According to Lewis (in Clarke, 2004), state actors ··might gain more from penetrating hostile cmnputer networks and unobtrusively observing them while they continue to operate'' than they would get from disrupting them (p, 197). Leaving the majority of extremist Islamist

websites online, Canadian security and policing agencies could potentially have been observing the activities of site visitors - as was said to have been done prior to the June 2006 arrest of an alleged n.p.)

and could have used such sites to identify facets of extremist Islatnist

appear to operate for the benefit of Islan1ist groups and sy1npathizers while - in actuality -being run to track visitors and to fulfil various, propagandist aims (i.e., the releasing of incendiary videos of speeches by prmninent Islmnist figures at opportune ti1nes) on behalf of ad1ninistrative interests. At least one site in this study is rmnoured - among internet forums and chat groups-- to be a front for CIA activities. According to Shane (2003), "'Jihad Unspun, an English-language site that appears to promote terror, may be a CIA creation, designed to find out who visits or orders videos glorifying bin Laden .. (n.p.). The Jihad Unspun site, run out of a Vancouver-based inten1et service provider, appears as a contrast to most other, cxtre1nist Islamist websites in this study - en1ploying a n1ixture of bold colors, attractive design motifs and stark images, the site appears as oddly professional, its juxtaposition of i1nmediately recognizable figures and an ·Islamist friendly" layout highly suspect. This site, mnong others, merits further investigation, as does the ·dummy site· theory, as it might well be possible that a large number of seemingly ·extremist Islamisf wcbsites are actually being run by domestic intelligence agencies.

F.2

Site Movement
There were also smne interesting results - in this study - regarding websites

which did go offline.

While smne sites in this study appeared to go down for

1naintenance -such as the fateh.orglnews/index website in week five of the observation period - other sites simply disappeared. Several observed websites reappeared, most And one site - aqsavoice.net -

notably the khilafat.org and albadil.edaama.org sites.

disappeared, only to be replaced by a page advertising such things as '"'"intimate anonymous sex", '"'"porn movies online'" and '"'"sexy muscle wmnen'·.

51

I

It was suspected - at this point - that the domain nmne of the latter site may have

been seized by a secondary party and the contents of the site replaced, as was done in the case of the alncda.com site, an alleged ·AI
Qaeda~

website seized by American hacker

Jon Messner in 2002 (Di Justo, 2002). Taking into account the prevalence of 'inten1et vigilantes·, groups of ·hackers· who specifically target perceived, extremist Islamist websites (Conway, 2002), the possibility was considered that this website had been 'hacked· and potentially brought under the control of another owner. After one week, at which point the advertising page which had replaced the previous contents of the aqsavoice.net site disappeared, the DNS address of this site was run through the
'whois~

service, located at www.whois.org . It was discovered that the

site was no longer registered by Tucows Ltd. - its previous registrar. Furthermore, it was observed that the status of this site was now 'locked'. As a
'locked~

status indicates that

a site has been secured against seizure by outside parties, this gave further wind to the suspicion that this site had been taken over by a hostile party, and had eventually been regained by its previous owner.

F.3

Clustering of Similarly-Affiliated Sites According to Service Provider
One interesting aspect of this study was the finding that - under certain Canadian

ISP's - there was a prevalence of multiple sites affiliated with single, Islamist groups. For example, at the conclusion of the observation phase of this project, five sites associated with the Islmnist group Hizballah were still active under Edmonton-based Tera-byte.com, while Peer 1 Network in Montreal was hosting several sites affiliated with the group Hizb-ut-Tahrir.

52

The prevalence of sin1ilarly-affiliated sites under singular, Canadian ISP's could be due to Canadian ISP hosting policies, but could also be attributed the range of services offered to potential clients.

their services may well be attractive to extremist,

Islmnist groups wishing to employ a user-friendly, easy accessible internet hosting company.

F.4

Prevalence of Sites under Tucows
One final project finding involves the provision of services to numerous websites

~

in this study - by Tucows Ltd. of Toronto. In the final week of this study, Tucows

appeared to be providing registration services to 13 observed sites, and was acting as a service provider for one additional site, making it the largest provider of services to extretnist Islamist groups observed in my study. The fact that Tucows provided services to a large number of extremist Islamist websites in this study could be partially explained by the size and business practices of the company itself. Tucows, which claitns to be the '"'"largest ICANN accredited

wholesale dmnain registrar in the world" (tucows.ca, 2006), currently manages more than four rr1illion domain names (thehostingnews.com, n.d.) on a global basis. As most of Tucows business is done through '"domain nmne resellers' (tucows.ca, 2006), meaning the

53

I

company sells the 1najority of their domain names indirectly through second party agents located throoughout the world, it is possible that the organization does not realize the extent to which extretnist Islamist groups have begun to etnploy its services. Domain names could - under Tucows operational structure - be registered on behalf of the organization, but absent the organization, s explicit pennission. F.S Final Thoughts The results of this project - although not substantial - did allow for some itnportant assumptions to be made. Where there was a certain degree of website

tnovement, and certain sites were brought ot1line, changed or replaced, outside interference could have potentially been present. Sites that went ot11ine and then returned could potentially have found new 'homes' in cyberspace, as Nacos (2006) indicates that sites sent offline '"usually find alternative servers" (p. 232). And Canadian internet

cmnpanies registering, hosting or providing datacentre services to sites might not have been aware of their involvetnent with extremist Islamist web content, due to various business practices and operational structures. In the future, it would behove additional researchers to take the limited results of this project into account and to extend a similar project to a wider geographical base, as opposed to simply focusing on one content or territory. This would allow a much tnore substantial view on the internet-related activities of extremist Islmnist groups, and more importantly, would help to give a more global picture of how extremist Islamist groups are operating within the confines of the internet and who is helping to shape, control and restrict their level of operation.

Responses to the Extren1ist Islamist use of the Internet

Frequently itnplicit - in literature dealing with the extremist Islmnist usc of the internet - is the inference that a lack of external scrutiny has allowed online activities by extretnist Islmnist groups to proceed with relative i1npunity. Proposing initiatives

designed to curb the augtnentation of extretnist Islamist activities in cyberspace, authors such as Weimann (2006) and Nacos (2006) quickly posit that - in the absence of ostensible pressures - extremist Islamist groups have developed a "virtually unchecked ability to use the lnten1et to plan, prmnote. and propagate" (Abbey, 2004, p. 24) and that a high degree of technical mastery over the e1nployment of the world-wide web by such groups has ensued as a result (Wei1nann, 2006 ). sometime run rings around us in The notion that ··Jslmnic extremists 2005, A31) underscores a feeling,

cyberspace·~ (Kristof~

held by many authors examining the 1nove1nent to the internet by Islamist groups, that the proficiency with which extremist lslamist organizations have tnade use of the internet stems from an historical lack of political will regarding the surveillance and curtailment of extremist Islan1ist cyber-activities. Online, cxtre1nist Islmnist activity is - in the eyes of many - at least a partial product of cmnplacency at official levels - writing about the growth of lslamist activity on the inten1et, one expert indicates that "a steady, stealthy indoctrination aimed at creating a whole new generation of jihadists'' by extremist Islamist groups remains ""scandalously ... unopposed .. (Ulph in Morgan, 2006, p.l ). Suppositions of an internet posing few restraints to extremist Islamist groups not only highlight an inability of many authors, policy 1nakers and national governments to comprehend the existence of obstacles to the extremist Islamist use of the internet, but as well belie an understanding of the presence of state and non state actors who monitor,

challenge and subvert the online actions of extre1nist Islmnist groups on a daily basis. As challenges do exist to the extremist lslamist use of the intcn1et. and as these challenges can be considered 1nultifarious and varied, it is in1portant to understand the ways in which substate and non-state individuals and groups, security and law enforce1nent agencies and state goven1ments and administrative powers respond to the extre1nist Islamist use of the inten1et. While ·hackers· and ·cyber vigilantes· scour the world-wide web, frequently and unexpectedly attacking the hmne pages and databases of groups such as Ham as and Hizballah, lone wolf "hacktivists · target well known, extremist Islmnist websites, defacing and frequently rendering them inoperable for long periods of ti1ne. Privately-funded research institutes and non-govem1nental organizations such as the SITE institute examine the emergence of the Islmnist ideology on the web frmn afar, drafting initiatives designed to constrain online, extre1nist Islmnis1n frmn numerous angles. And lawmakers, security organizations and ele1nents of federal govem1nents

surreptitiously monitor, track and, occasionally, - take action upon extre1nist Islmnist websites, chat rooms and all other internet technologies e1nployed by such groups. All of these responses can be considered in the context of an almost inevitable response to the perceived explosion of perceivably uncontrollable phenomenon, one which evokes feelings of apprehension, a sense of urgency, and more often than not the need for action in a 1nultiplicity of substate, non-state and state actors.

X. Conclusions Far from being an isolated occurrence, the extre1nist Islmnist presence on the inten1et has become a significant phenomenon, one which has spread to a 1nultitude of international registrars, service providers and dataccntcrs and which is now being witnessed on a global scale. Having moved into cyberspace in large numbers, extre1nist Islamist groups - such as Hizballah and Hmnas - now e1nploy various internet-based innovations for their purposes, including e-1nail, chat romns and online bulletin boards and presently utilize the internet to 1nake possible a range of aims, such as cmnmunication, recruitment, organization and community building. While the decentralized nature of the internet has allowed for dispersed, extre1nist Islamist organizations to remain in close contact while retaining a large degree of autonomy, the dynamic and seemingly unregulated online environment has pennitted such groups to broadcast potentially uncensored tnessages to a global audience. The

speed and efficiency of internet-driven transmissions has allowed extremist Islamist groups to rapidly convey substantial amounts of data between organizations and to potential members, and the ability to quickly publish data online has permitted these groups to easily make available text, images, audio and video at critical times. Extre1nist Islmnist groups have come to rely on the internet for the fulfilment of a broad range of activities and aims, ultimately leading to assertions - by some - that such organizations have become strongly dependent upon communicative medium (Last, 2005). At the same time as understanding the potential which the internet has given extremist Islamist groups to more effectively conduct their operations - however - we this powerful and indispensable -

57

1nust also be aware of a '"superhighway.. of surveillance and internet policing which has developed largely as a response to the extre1nist Islmnist use of the internet (Wade in Clarke, 2004, p.l24). Fonned partially out of a perception - by law enforcement and security agencies - that the internet provides extremist organizations. specifically extre1nist Islmnist groups, with a potentially unchecked, global voice {Tuman, 2003 ), a new regime of internet regulation has seen the creation of laws and technologies designed to assist in the interception, surveillance and control of online content. This is leading to a fundmnental challenge to the existing structure of the internet, and is laying the foundation for a shift into ""a period where the secondary goal will be access and the primary goal wi II be security'' (Light in Klotz, 2004, p.lll ). This severity of this new regime of internet regulation and control should not be understated. While the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercri1ne24 places

'"obligations on upon ISP's that, in effect, convert service providers into integral cogs in the apparatus of online law ·enforcement" (Huey and Rosenberg, 2004, p.l ), Bill C-74, Canada's Lawful Access Act, forces Canadian internet companies to disclose all available personal information of "'any subscriber to any of the service provider·s telecommunications services" {parl.gc.ca, 2005) upon request by law enforcement. Antiterroris1n Bill C-36, in its "web of unprecedented investigative powers, broad offences and harsh punish1nent (Daniels, Macklem and Roach, 2001, p. 152) 1nakes it a crime 25 to house the websites of banned, extremist Islamist groups, even unknowingly. And a host of other internet control and surveillance technologies - from intelligent filters to datamining tools - combine to create an environment in which online freedoms and privacies

58

are being increasingly challenged, and in which the ·spectre· of online, extremist Islmnist activity pales in cmnparison to methods used to challenge this activity. Perhaps the tnost pressing part of the spread of online surveillance is that an apperception of how new policies, laws and technologies are being applied to the inten1et is lacking mnong the Canadian populace. A need to understand the ways in which new policies and new technologies ··facilitate the erosion of privacy in unprecedented ways"" (Austin in Daniels, Macklem & Roach, 2001, p.263) appears to be a low priority mnong Canadians - a recent poll
~

in which Canadians indicated the need for ""tough new

security n1easures'" indicates that citizens of Canada have yet to grasp the extent to which security-related technologies and the policies behind them have penetrated Canadian webspace (Clark, 2005, n.p.). Ultimately, we tnust understand that
~

as extretnist Islamist groups increasingly

gain a foothold on the internet, their presence will be 1net by new online surveillance and control tneasures. Security and policing agencies, wishing to both counter and 1nonitor extremist Islamist activity within Canada, will make ready use of new policies, laws and technologies to delimit the ability of these actors to function within the online environment. This will no doubt lead to a significant struggle, one which will see

extremist Islamist groups continually finding new and innovative ways to bypass official methods of infonnation tnanagement, and one which will see further increases in the development and use of online surveillance and policing policies, methods and technologies by Canadian security and law enforcement.

It will be the victor of this

the one set of actors most able to leverage the internet for their own purposes -

who will ultimately be in the best position to shape the future of the online world.

Appendix B- Extremist Islamist Groups with Websites in this Study
Al-Aqsa 1\lartvrs' Brigade The ai-Aqsa Martyrs· Brigades is a militant. Palestinian group tied to Yasser Arafat's Fateh organisation. Formed at the outset of the second Palestinian Intifada (also known as the ai-Aqsa Intifada). this group made up of an unknown number of small cells- aims to drive Israeli settlers from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem. and to establish a Palestinian state. This is an organization which- at the same time as ofTicially rejecting most of the aims of Islamist groups- utilizes Islam as a pretext for their struggle against the Israeli state. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs· Brigade has conducted shootings and suicide operations against civilian and military targets in Israel and Palestine as \veil as attacks against Israeli settlements on the West Bank. The 26 group is currently designated as a foreign 'terrorist" group under Canadian law.

Hamas is a militant. Islamist. Palestinian group formed at the beginning of the first Palestinian Intifada in 19R7. This group currently forms the democratically elected Government of Palestine. Hamas- whose 1988 charter calls for Israel's detruction and replacement with an Islamic Palestinian. state- has been responsible for attacks against Israeli civilian and military targets since 1990. Hamas has been one of the main groups involved in the planning and carrying out of a wave of suicide bombings which have struck Israel since the commencement of the second Palestinian Intifada in 2000. The group is 27 currently designated as a foreign 'terrorist' group under Canadian law. Hizballah Hizballah is a militant. Islamist. Lebanese group closely linked to Iran. Formed in 1982 as a response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Hizballah · s main objective is the elimination of Israel and the liberation of Jerusalem. This group seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in Lebanon, and is active in the current political process in Lebanon. Hizballah has been credited with numerous militant attacks on targets in Lebanon. Israel and throughout the world. This group is responsible for the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut in 19R3 as well as attacks on Israeli targets in Argentina and Brazil. The group is currently designated as a foreign 'terrorisf group under Canadian law. 2x Hizb-ut-Tahrir Hizb-ut-Tahrir is an Islamist. political group operational in several countries (including Australia, Bangladesh, and Great Britain). This group advocates the establishment of a global Caliphate (a state ruled by a strict interpretation oflslamic Law) and supports the declaration of Jihad against the state of Israel. Hizb-ut-Tahrir has condoned suicide bombings against Israeli civilian targets. It is currently banned in many countries around the world, but is currently not designated as a foreign 'terrorist" group under 29 Canadian law.

for the last week. I have been doing continuous searches for extremist. Islamist websites operating under Canadian ISP's using the Googlc. Excite and Yahoo search engines- noting that these arc some of the most popular and well known engines and available and would probably yield the best results. This hasn ·t really proved fruitful. .. I turned to websitcs Internet Haganah (www.haeanah.us). siteinstitute.org and trackingterrorism.com. sites which track extremist. Islamist websites. to provide some insight into which sites are being operated by which extremist. Islamist groups,. I have fc..1Lmd 32 active sites. I have plotted all of my sites on my interactive map and have commenced the process of documenting the movement of these websites in Google earth. Already, my results are as follows: 32 sites in total active 1 mirror site

I am somewhat surprised at this point to see that there are not more extremist Islamist websites active in Canadian webspace. noting all the American talk over Canada being a "hotbed oflslamic extremism". That said. I've read somewhere that the majority of the world's "terrorist'' websites are hosted in the United States anyways. so this seems a bit of hypocrisy on the part of the United States. Interesting to see how many of these sites are being hosted by Tucows of Toronto ... I'll have to take a look to see why this is. The one mirror site I've found, hosted by Tucows (jamaat-islamia.org) points back to Islamicawakening.com, another site hosted by the same company. Tucows is certainly popular with extremist Islamist groups. So. the Al Aqsa Martyrs brigade, Hamas, Hizballah and Hizb ut-Tahrir and possibly a few other groups all operate pages in Canadian webspace.

Appendix D
After the first \\'eck of monitoring the extremist Islamist websites I have set out to examine. I have now gathered the first evidence that such sites tend to appear, disappear and change location weekly, However. out of 32 sites which were active in week one. 29 of these sites arc still active. suggesting the 'coming and going· of these sites is not as pronounced as I had initially thought. Tucows is still hosting the majority of the extremist Islamist wcbsites in Canadian webspace. with 13 sites still active. The reason this might be is because of the combination of two facts: a) Tucmvs is one of the world's bigger registrars b) They do most of their business through international resellers I intend to cal1 Tucmvs this week and ask them what their policy is regarding content. This might shed more light on the prevalence of extremist Islamist sites registered by them. My week two results are as follows: 29 sites in total active 3 sites de-activated I mirror site 2 re-directs

Two sites have become inactive at this point- fateh.org and aqsavoice.net. A third, khilafat.org. gives a strange error message. "Access denied for user: 'admin 1korg@:erbium.webserverdns.com"- suggesting that - for whatever reason this site has been shut down and the administrator locked out. Someone might have gotten hold of this site. taken it down and locked the owners out. .. Not sure yet. Apparently there are hackers who specialize in shutting down these types of websites. Jamaat-islamia.org remains a mirror site for \vww.islamicmvakening.com. Also, two sites- ikhwan.net and al-multaqa.net- now seem to re-direct to www.hassanalbana.org, a site hosted by . Both of these sites appear to fall into the 'other sites' category, as does ww\v.hassanalbana.org.

At this point, fateh.org, aqsavoice.net and khilafat.org remain inactive. At khilafat.org, the error message from the previous week has disappeared and the site is simply non-existent now. As well, one other site has gone offline- albadil.cdaama.org, a hizb ut-tahrir site- has disappeared. This brings to four the number of sites rendered inactive since the start of this project. not a significant amount by any means. ikhwan.net and al-multaqa.net continue to re-direct to www.hassanalbana.org while jamaat-islamia.org remains a mirror site for www.islamiccnvakenin!!.com. Perhaps the most significant aspect of this week's findings- however- is the appearance of alfirdaws.org (found through another series of searches) registered under Tucows of Toronto and falling under the label of'other sites'. This brings the total of sites in my study back up to 29. The fact that so many sites affiliated with extremist Islamist groups banned in Canada remain active raises questions as to whether or not ISPs like Tucows are aware of the existence of such sites on their servers. It also means that everything seems pretty static as far as these sites go- in other words. the majority of these sites are apparently not facing any sizable threats to their continued operation.

Appendix F
This week. I have begun to see that a lot of my prior assumptions expectations that sites would go up and down at random, major changes in format_ the disappearance and re-appearance of different sites are not really proving prophetic. This week saw the disappearance of a site. but the re-appearance of several others. The majority of sites in my study have remained with their respective registrars. servers and dataccntres so fac and have not really gone anywhere. I suspect that many Canadian ISP's don't really have an interest in shutting these sites do\vn ... Either that. or they're just handling too much of a load at one time and are not mvare that they are providing services to extremist. Islamist websites. One wonders too about law enforcement here ... If Canadian security organizations are aware of the existence of these sites. which they probably are. why are these sites not going down?

In week four, aqsavoice.net and fateh.org remain inactive. Joining these sites on the inactive list is alfirdaws.org. which appeared only last week. ikhwan.net and al-multaqa.net still re-direct to www.hassanalbana.org- jamaat-islamia.org remains a mirror site for www.islamicawakening.com. The most significant aspect of week four is that khilafat.org and albadil.edaama.org have once again become active-- both of these are sites hosted in Toronto and afTiliated with Hizb ut-tahrir. This brings the total number of sites active- out of a total of 32 that I had initially been watching- back up to 30. I will continue to do searches throughout the coming weeks- I have a feeling that there are more extremist Islamist websites being hosted in Canadian webspace, and that there are a firm set of reasons behind the fact that they don't really seem to change position as often as one would assume.

Fateh.org, aqsavoice.net and alfirdaws.org remain inactive- noteworthy here- however- is a temporary splash page appearing in place ofF ateh.org, indicating that "Our server is down for maintenance process, we will come back soon ..... and on the bottom of the page, "If your website have website at our server it will come soon. don't worry." Obviously, someone is still in control of this domain name and intends to bring fateh.org back up at some point. The Hizballah site nasrollah.net is now also inactive. The only other thing worth noting this week is the replacement of what was once the Hamas site aqsavoice.net with a general advertisement page for a range of adult elements, including "'Free Girls Naked". "'Sex Photo Personal Ads'' and "Real Sex in Russia''. I'm not sure who is responsible for putting up these ad pages in place of former extremist Islamist websites, but I have witnessed this before in visiting a few addresses of former extremist sites- hosted in the United States- which had been replaced with similar advertisement pages.

Appendix H
In week six. I have again noticed movement and activity. A few interesting things have happened this \\'eek which I have not yet seen. A few sites which were previously re-directing to a certain site have again changed direction and are now pointing to a difTerent site. As well, a few sites have again been deactivated. though surprisingly not at the Tucows server. As l"\·e said before. though. it really doesn "t seeEl like a significant amount of sites are changing position at all. My results for week 6 are as follows: 28 sites in total active 3 Sites inactive 2 sites de-activated 1 mirror site I site re-directing 1 site no longer re-directing

However, ikhwan.net and al-multaqa.net no longer re-direct to www.hassanalbana.om- instead. al-multaqa.net and hassanalbana.org re-direct to ikhwan.net. This is an interesting turns of events, one that I can't really explain.

Appendix I
I am nearing the end of my two month study (only one week left) and am not feeling like my study has yielded the results I expected. The results which I have seen a few sites up and down here and there have been less than dramatic. I did not expect the rapid fluctuation of sites up and down on a daily basis, although neither did I expect that the majority of sites which rve been monitoring would stay up so long. My results for week seven are as follows: 29 sites in total active 5 sites inactive 1 new site active 1 site no longer hosted by Canadian company (still registered by Canadian company)

In week 7, al-nour.net, nasrollah.net, fateh.org, aqsavoice.net and alfirdaws.org remain inactive. Fateh.org still has the same splash page representing it as seen in week five- it appears that 'maintenance' is taking longer than expected on the site. Other than this, one new site has come into being- this is a Hizballah site. almadiscouts.org.

Appendix J
This the final week of my study. To put it lightly. I have seen a few but no dramatic- changes in the two month observation period I have undertaken. I suspect there was a lot more going on in this study than I know about hopefully the literature will help to solve some of the ambiguities l"ve seen in this project. My results for week eight are as follows: 27 sites in total active 5 sites inactive 2 site(s) deactivated

In this final week. it appears that 27 total sites are still active out of an original total of 32 sites. This is not really what I had envisioned the end result of my project being when I had first started. I had expected- at the outset of my project- to see large fluctuations- I had assumed in the first place that I would find more sites to begin with. The last \veek in this observation period is thus only really notable for the amount of sites that still active. Perhaps as a combination of the fact that running an extremist website is not illegal per-se in Canada, and the fact that most Canadian service providers seem to have a high tolerance for extremist websites such as the ones I"ve observed in my study, nothing there was no significant decrease in the amount of sites I observed in my study. At the end of this week, al-nour.net, nasrollah.net, fateh.org, aqsavoice.net and alfirdaws.org remain inactive. Alrassoul.org and Jamaat-islamia.org are also inactive as of this week. I feel at this point that- despite the unspectacular results of my research, something can be said about the fact that so many sites belonging to groups banned in Canada continue to operate. It may- in fact-- have to do with the security situation in Canada. Perhaps it is more beneficial to leave these sites online then to take them down- not solely for the fact that potential site visitors can be monitored (by law enforcement) by doing so. but even more so that- if Canadian law enforcement and intelligence agencies leave such sites up - they may in fact be fomenting a relationship in which Canadian service providers work at the behest of Canada· slaw enforcement community. This theory definitely merits more investigation. All in all. a worthwhile study despite the unspectacular results.
