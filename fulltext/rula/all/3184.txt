Abstract
SEISMIC RESPONSF nF RF.TNFORCED CONCRETE ELEVATED WATER TOWERS

ty

Modem composite elevated storage tanks were developed in late 1970's in response to increasing demand for a reliable, economical and low-maintenance water storage system in Canada and the US. The popularity of composite elevated water towers rose tremendously in the last 30 years, as the new type of construction offered many advantages over traditional elevated water storage tanks. Despite the increasing rate of construction, the performance of this type of structure under ground motions is not fully understood. During the recent earthquake of Bhuj 2001, many shaft staging elevated water towers experienced severe damages, signifying the lack of considerable ductility, redundancy and energy dissipation in the system.

This thesis investigates the current approach to the design of shaft staging elevated towers, and also summarizes a comprehensive literature review of structural theories, latest research and studies. The response of a selected concrete shaft staging elevated tower, designed according to the currant practice and subjected to gradually increasing lateral load was investigated through a non-linear static finite element analysis. Additionally, the seismic performance of the structure during four different ground motions with various peak ground accelerations was studied through several time-history non-linear finite element analyses. The results of static and dynamic finite element analyses were used to evaluate and establish the response modification factor used for design of these types of structures.

INTRODUCTION

Elevated water tanks are part of water distribution system in many urban and rural areas in many countries including Canada and US. They play an important role in providing a steady water flow in peak demand hours of the day without applying excessive pressure on water distribution network. Use of elevated water tanks also eliminates the need for heavy pumping facilities that are often costly to construct and operate.

Water which is collected from dams, underground basins, rivers and lakes (Lake Ontario in Toronto) is pumped into water treatment facilities where water is filtered and cleaned throughout an intricate process in order to decrease the physical, chemical and biological impurities (City of Toronto 2008). Potable water is then stored in large underground storage tanks from where it is pumped into elevated water towers for distribution as shown in Figure 1.1.

The capacity of the tank and pumping facility is selected in such a way that during hours of peak water demand, the tank can reasonably maintain the required water pressure without increasing pumping capacity. During low demand hours, the elevated tank can be efficiently replenished by energy efficient pumping mechanism. However water tanks are sometimes disconnected from the system since direct pumping can satisfy the demand.

Elevated water tanks are also very beneficial for satisfying fire requirements and minimizing the damage. They also remain operational for several hours during power outage or pump failure. Being one of vital infra-structures in a post disaster area, elevated water towers must be designed and constructed with special attention in order for structure to remain fully functional even after a major natural disaster, where immediate access to clean and drinkable water is extremely crucial for survivors of a major disaster.

Elevated water towers are commonly designed and constructed in two conventional structural systems: framed structure and concrete shaft structure. Both structural steel and concrete framing systems are commonly used in towers with frame supporting structures as shown in Figure 1.2

Frame supporting structure benefits from high redundancy factor, owmg to many structural components, where failure of one member does not lead to collapse of entire structure and the load is redistributed between still functioning members. Framed structures also can be design and constructed to exhibit moderate to high ductility, redundancy, energy dissipation and damping capabilities which are important aspect of reducing seismic strength demand. However, construction and maintenance of this type of structures are often costly which enforces authorities and designers to consider concrete pedestal shaft as an alternative structural system. Concrete pedestal tanks can be either made entirely from reinforced concrete, or steel tank and concrete support as shown in Figure 1.3.

Composite pedestal towers which are investigated in this study, are usually constructed in three common types: Dome floor, slab floor and suspended steel floor (ACI 371 -08) as shown in Figure 1.4

Figure 1.4- Three common construction types of composite elevated tanks: a) Dome-floor tank, b) Slabfloor tank, c) Suspended-steel-floor

Among three types of composite construction, the dome-floor system is preferred to the others, since the horizontal component of the axial thrust of the dome is canceled out by the one from steel tank, resulting in a smoother load tr.ansfer. However, there are several advantages and disadvantages in each type of construction as specified by Meier (2002), which play an important role in selection of construction type.

Despite the increasing use of concrete shaft as supporting structures, little efforts have been done to better identify their true response to seismic loads. As a result of its unique geometry, redundancy is dramatically reduced since alternative load path barley exits, in case failure is initiated in one region of structure. Lack of a substantial energy dissipation mechanism in structure further increases the seismic demand. However, the sloshing effects of stored water may contribute to energy dissipation if carefully designed. Additionally, concrete shaft structure does not undergo large inelastic deformation, despite general assumption for building structure which offsets the seismic reduction factor (R) for calculating seismic demand.

LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1

General

This Chapter of thesis summarizes a comprehensive literature review of existing codes, guidelines, previous studies, structural theories and computer software. Although most recognized building codes such as ACI 318-08, ASCE-7 2005, NBCC 2005, IBC 2006, EuroCode-8 1998, etc. offer valuable recommendations for loading and design of this type of structures, the guideline presented by ACI Committee 371 thoroughly covers most of the design aspects of concrete/composite elevated water tower structures. Even though the theory behind most of the loading and design consideration is adopted from building structures, some characteristics are unique to elevated water towers and are hardly observed in other structures.

Surprisingly, limited number of literature is available that investigates the nonlinear seismic behavior of concrete shaft staging. Several attempts have been made in recent years to explain and model the liquid-structure interaction in elevated towers using different liquid sloshing models over the past few decades by Shepherd (1972), Haroun and Ellaithy (1985), Ibrahim and Soundarajan (1983) and Liavog and Dogangu (2006). The influence of base-isolation in seismic response of water towers was also studied by Shenton and Hampton (1999). However, the seismic behavior of pure reinforced concrete shafts, excluding the liquid sloshing, was never thoroughly investigated.

Similar to conventional structures, the elastic response of structure is adjusted by seismic reduction factor (R), in order to incorporate redundancy, over-strength, energy dissipation, and the most importantly, ductility which plays the most important role in reducing seismic loads. Unlike building structures which can undergo relatively large non-linear deformation, available ductility is limited in concrete shaft staging elevated water towers.

Axial load Capacity

Axial load capacity of shaft wall which ultimately translates to flexural capacity of shaft, is influenced by strength of wall constituents (concrete and reinforcements), wall geometry and load eccentricities. The effects of these factors in vertical load capacity are investigated in the following sections.

2.2.1

Buckling

Concrete shaft staging for composite water towers is designed and constructed in variety of geometry, in order to maintain the two main design requirements of water distribution network: pressure and water capacity. The diameter of the shaft is then determined in proportionate to tank diameter to control the axial thrust in conical segment of steel tank. However, other parameters may alter the geometry if required. Theoretically, the shaft geometry may change between very short and large diameter to slender and tall. In very large diameter staging, buckling shape may be modeled as the buckling of elastic straight plates (Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger 1959) as follows,

Eq.2.2

Where E is the modulus of elasticity of concrete, vis Poisson's ratio of concrete, hw is wall thickness and bw is width of unit length of the wall. In the above equation, k is the buckling coefficient which is calculated based on boundary conditions. Reducing the shaft diameter, the shaft wall tends to buckle in diamond shape pattern, similar to buckling mode of thin cylindrical shapes as shown in Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1 - Buckling of a cylindrical shell

Using classical elastic bucking theory of thin wall cylindrical elements, critical bucking stress is calculated as follows,

Eq.2.2

Above equation is further simplified in ACI 371-98 as,

Eq. 2.3

Where, Cc is equal to 0.59 for Poisson ' s ratio of 0.20. y is a reduction factor equal to 116.6 and it accounts for residual stresses and geometric imperfections along the length of element. hw is the wall thickness excluding architectural rustification and dw is the mean diameter of the shaft. In above equation E is modulus of elasticity of the wall. In the 2008 edition of ACI-371, the parameter yCc is replaced with C which is calculated based on experiments on thin metal cylindrical members as follows, C= 0.6[1.0-0.9(1.0-e-

e)]

Eq.2.4

where,

Eq.2.5

And e is the load eccentricity. Critical buckling stress can be expressed as a function of specific compressive strength. Thus, the slenderness coefficient f3wis calculated as,

Eq.2.6

Above equation is further simplified in ACI 371-08 by taking into account the long term modulus of elasticity due to creep. Also a compressive strength of 4.0 ksi is considered in calculation. Therefore, ACI 371-08 suggests using· following equation for limiting slenderness,

~ w=

80-:::; 1

h

Eq.2.7

As the height of the shaft increases, the possibility of overall column buckling also increases. Thus, the critical axial load capacity can be calculated as,

Eq.2.8

2.2.2

Accidental Eccentricities

An additional reduction factor (Cw=0.55) is recommended in ACI 371-98 for calculating vertical load capacity of cylindrical wall members to account for accidental eccentricity in loading of wall element originated from geometrical changes and imperfections and other disturbances. A 45% reduction in compressive force is deemed to be adequate for a 10

compressive force that lies within Kern region of cross section (Mofid et al. 2000 and 2001) as shown in Figure 2.2.

However, in many cases such as an eccentrically loaded ring beam, radial rotation of flexible raft foundation, eccentrically loaded annular ring foundation and differential settlement of concentrically loaded annular ring foundation, the actual accidental eccentricity in wall element may exceed the above value and must be calculated.

In a cross section with no openings, the overall shear center of the cross section is located in the center of the cylinder, which aligns with the direction of the applied force. As a result, shear force is divided equally between two sides as shown in Figure 2.7a. In presence of openings, the overall shear center of the section is shifted from the center toward the un-interrupted wall; resulting a considerable eccentricity between line of action and center of shear resistance as shown in Figure 2.7b.

Figure 2.8- Variation of shear coefficient (ac) over the ratio of height to width of shear wall

The shear cracks are generally tensile cracks in nature, since they appear in the member where the principal tensile stress exceeds the modulus of rupture of concrete. Thus, upon increasing the height of the wall, bending moment and consequently tensile stresses increase in the member near the fixed support. Using this principal, coefficient ac is calculated as follows ,

2.5Mu ac= 6 - - -·- Vudw

Eq. 2.19

However, this equation does not incorporate the positive effects of compression forces in shear strength. Therefore, the results of this equation are expected to be considerably conservative when predicting shear strength of concrete. This explains the minimal shear cracks and damages to the concrete shaft staging of affected water tower (Bhuj 2005 earthquake). To avoid the brittle shear failure in walls, ACI 371-08 limits the maximum shear strength of the wall section to 8 f fAcv in un-disrupted section and to 10ffAcv 17

in sections with openings. These limitations suggest that in case of additional required strength, the geometry of the concrete cross section must be increased rather than adding horizontal reinforcement.

2.4

Second Order Analysis

In structures with large gravity loads such as elevated water towers, the development of a considerable second-order moment is highly credible. However, due to thin wall construction of this type of structures, they do not demonstrate high lateral displacement capability and the structural failure may commence prior to initiation of secondary moment. Analytical researches suggested that structures with stability index (Q) of more than 25% suffer from structural instability. The
st~bility

index (Q) is the ratio of

secondary moments to first-order moment as suggested by ACI 318-08 as follows,

Creep

Creep is a form of permanent deformation of concrete under long term compressive forces, which is believed to be due to re-arrangement and moving of hydration products in the concrete. Sustaining high level of compressive forces, the supporting structure of elevated tanks are highly susceptible to creep deformation, which may result in development of excessive stress in reinforcement and yielding of reinforcement bars under service load conditions.

Under constant long term loading, deformation in compression members increases over time. Upon unloading the member, concrete will not return to its initial length whereas little or no residual deformation is observed in steel. In other word, the stresses in concrete portion of RIC member decreases over time, while stress in steel is significantly increasing and may lead to yielding of steel member. Although presence of high compressive stress m reinforcement may not be of much concern, reduction in compressive stress m concrete explains abundance of early flexural crack in the circumference of the shaft wall.

2.6

Seismic Response of Elevated Water Towers

Behavior of elevated water towers subjected to ground motion can be evaluated considering a Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) system or as so called Single Lumped Mass Approximation as recommended by ACI 371-08, as long as the weight of water comprises 80% or more of total dead load of structure. In order to understand the behavior of this type of structures, the general dynamic equations of motion are studied (Clough and Penzien 2003, Chopra 1995 and Chen and Liew 2003) and briefly presented in Appendix B of this study.

Figure 2.9- a) Idealized single degree offreedom system and its basic dynamic components, b) Influence of ground excitation on the system, c) Equilibrium of dynamic forces in the system.

A SDOF system can be represented by three parameters: m (mass), k (stiffness) and c (damping coefficient) as show in Figure 2.9a. Dynamic load, which is applied in the form of ground movement, initiates deformation in the structure shown in Figure2.9b. Based on dynamic equilibrium of forces, the dynamic equation of motion is expressed as follows, m xt (t) +c x(t)+ k x(t) =0
Eq. 2.22 2

where, x(t), x(t) and X1 (t) are relative mass displacement, velocity and total mass acceleration, respectively. In above equation the inertial force generated by mass is a function of total acceleration, whereas velocity and damping forces are related to relative motion. The total acceleration comprises ground acceleration and relative acceleration as follows,
Eq. 2.23

20

Where, xg(t) and x(t) are

ground

acceleration

and

relative

mass

accelerations.

Substituting in above equation, the equilibrium of dynamic forces can be re-written as, mx(t)+cx(t)+kx(t)= -mxg(t)
Eq. 2.24

Using Duhamel integral, the relative displacement function of an under critically damped oscillating mass subjected to arbitrary acceleration applied to support can be calculated as follows ,

Eq. 2.25

where,

OJ

and

OJv

are undamped and damped angular frequency of vibrations,

respectively. P(r) is time dependent dynamic load and (is dampmg ratio. As suggested by numerical calculations, a subtle difference exists between damping
(~
OJ

and

OJv

for low ratios of

< 10%). Therefore, undamped angular frequency may be used in calculation.

Since the amount of generated force in the oscillator's spring mechanism is ultimately controlled by maximum mass displacement ifs_max

= k Xmax).

therefore the maximum

absolute value of response (or spectral relative displacement) can be calculated by maximizing displacement function as follows,

Eq.2.26

However, it is sometimes more convenient to calculate and use the maximum velocity and acceleration for a seismic excitation. In addition, presenting three parameters gives a better understanding of seismic nature. Having in mind the sinusoidal characteristics of free vibration function of a SDOF system (Gaberson 2007), a false maximum velocity as so called pseudo-velocity spectral response can be defined as follows,
Eq. 2.27

21

Similarly, pseudo-acceleration spectral response is expressed as,

Eq. 2.28

Numerical calculations suggest that above equations are true for damping ratios less than 20% which is the case in most structures. Since, a simple linear relationship can be established between response parameters, they can also be illustrated simultaneously in a response spectrum graph shown in Figure 2.10a. As suggested by Newmark and Hall (1982), response spectrum curve can be normalized for peak ground acceleration of l.OOg considering the scalar relation between response spectrum curve and maximum response acceleration, velocity and displacement shown in Figure 2.10b.

Considering historical and geological data, a design response spectrum is constructed for every region for rock-site conditions, which often includes a conservative damping coefficient. The response spectral curve is then amplified for different soil properties, for seismic acceleration increases as soil gets softer. This behavior can be explained by the basic theory of elastic layer suggested by Finn and Wightman (2003) and adopted in NBCC 2005 as follows,
A=---K+~

Eq. 2.29

where

Ps is the critical damping ratio and K is the impedance ratio. As appears in above

equation, upon decreasing the impedance ratio (stiffness), the seismic wave which is assumed to be propagating from rock layer is also amplified as shown in Figure 2.11a. However, as earthquake intensity increases, the hysteretic damping of soil also increases and shear capacity decreases. Therefore for very high ground accelerations the soil losses the capacity to transfer seismic wave (ldriss 1990) as shown in Figure 2.11 b.

Although different building codes prescribe a slightly different procedure for constructing the response spectra curve, they all share the fundamental concept as described before. In the model suggested by ASCE 7-05, and also adopted by ACI 371-08 and IBC 05, using the spectral response acceleration values (Ss and S1) for structures with period of vibration of 0.2s and l .Os, and considering specified regional long period of vibration
(h) the design response acceleration spectra is determined after applying soil

amplification factors F., and Fa. The mapped spectral response parameters (SDs and SDJ) are available for site class B, which represents rock-site condition. Calculated response is then amplified or reduced based on local soil condition as shown in Table 2.1 .

In structures with very low period of vibration (high frequency), the structural response acceleration of oscillating mass is almost equal to ground acceleration due to very large structural stiffness. Structures with fundamental periog of vibrations between Ts and To , the structural response will be largest according seismic specification of ASCE 7-05.

more accurate estimation of seismic

Once the design spectrum is established, the design spectral acceleration that corresponds to the period of vibration of structure can be determined. In a SDOF system approach, the fundamental period of vibration of structure is used to calculate the elastic response. Where, the period of vibration is calculated based on on-cracked cross-section which exhibits linear elastic behavior as suggested ASCE 7-05. A similar approach is used in ACI 371-08, NBCC 05 and EuroCode 1998 since elastic period of vibration can be easily calculated using established techniques in mechanics of material. Subsequently, the seismic response coefficient which determines the base shear for elevated water tower can be calculated from the following equation as suggested by ASCE 7-05 and adopted by ACI 371-08.

S n 1 I S DS I) C s = max [ min ( T R , R , 0.044 S DS I

Eq. 2.30

In above equation, I is the importance factor, T is the fundamental period of vibration. Sos and S01 are the parameters of design acceleration response spectra for short period and l.Os period structures, respectively. Also, R is the seismic reduction factor for elevated water towers which is explained in next section.

2.7

Seismic Reduction/Modification Factor (R)

As customary in the building codes of many developed countries, seismic forces are calculated for structures at their elastic state, which is then adjusted for non-elastic response by applying a reduction factor. Seismic reduction factor (R) as so called in north American building Code or structural behavior factor (q) in Eurocode-8 or structural performance coefficient (C) in Chinese Code, symbolizes many structural characteristic such as ductility, energy absorption, redundancy, etc. However, the main feature in this parameter is ductility which is obtained from large non-linear deformation of structure. Since seismic load are normally categorized as rare loads, it is economical to use every bit of strength available in the structure. Hence, the influence of all structural strength is
25

taken in to consideration in a study done by Mitchell el at. (2005) which is later adopted in NBCC-06. In this study, the effects of different structural characteristics are recognized through two major components as follows,
Eq. 2.31

Where, Rd is ductility related modification factor and Ro is modification factor arising from over strength of structure, which is defined as:

R o = R size R <1> R yield R sh R mech

Eq. 2.32

In above equation Rsize incorporates the effects of larger section geometry m commercially available members. Rrp reverses the reduction in strength arising from material reduction factor and is equal to 1/cp. Ryield acc.ounts for conservatively labeled yield strength in materials. Rsh is the strain-hardening factor that may develop over large deformations. Rmech accounts for extra strength in the system prior to development of a collapse mechanism. As indicated by Mitchell et al (2005), the last parameter may only be considered in structures that are redundant and yielding in its component occurs one after another.

Applying the ductility related seismic reduction factors (Rd) to the structure is expected to reduce the spectral elastic base shear (Ve) to the yielding strength level (Vy) as shown in Figure 2.13a. However, a considerable amount of reserved strength still exists in the system, which would be overlooked if structure was designed for calculated yield strength (Vy). Therefore, using a proper secondary reduction factor (Rd) the design base shear is further reduced, allowing for structure to achieve the ultimate structural strength during a major earthquake. A portion of seismic force reduction is also attributed to structural damping (R;;) as specified by Applied Technology Council (A TC-19 95), since structures usually do not poses a significant natural damping
properties(~::;

5%), and its

effect is usually integrated in calculation of seismic acceleration response spectra.

The ductility related modification factor (Rd) is the most important component of seismic force modification factor (R), which is in direct relationship with inelastic deformation of structure In an elastoplastic idealization of structural response as shown in Figure 2.13b, considering the peak elastic response (j0 ) and its corresponding elastic displacement (u 0 ), along with the yield strength (/y) and displacement (uy), the yield reduction factor (Ry) can be defined as follows,

Eq. 2.33

Although, there is limited stiffness available in the system beyond yield strength, the elastoplastic system will momentarily accommodate the seismic load through exhibiting a large inelastic deformation (um) until the direction of loading is reversed. The ratio of maximum deformation (um) to yield displacement (uy) is called ductility demand and is defined as follows,

Eq. 2.34

27

Investigating the variation of ductility demand for four category of elastoplastic systems subjected to El Centro Earthquake by Chopra (1995) as shown in Figure 2.14, the systems with high stiffness; demand an extensive amount of ductility since they are acceleration sensitive structures. As stiffness reduces, the ductility demand also decreases and stabilizes for long period systems. However, it should be noted that high or low level of ductility demand does not necessarily means large or small displacements, as it is merely the ratio of maximum displacement (um) to yield displacement (uy).

Since limited amount of ductility is available in a system the ductility demand must remain bellow the ductility capacity during an episode of ground excitation. Thus, many experimental and numerical studies have been done in the past to establish a relationship between ductility related modification factor (Rf.l) and elastic period of vibration of structure (Te) with fixed value of ductility demand {Jld).

28

The previous studies by Newmark and Hall (1982), Nassar and Krawinkler (1991) and Miranda and Bertero (1994) yield similar results for variation of ductility factor (R11 ) for different fundamental period of vibrations as shown in Figure 2.15.

Numerical studies by Tong et al (2005) using 374 earthquake records on elastoplastic systems (Figure 2.16a) also

supports the linear relationship between ductility demand (Jid) and ductility factor (Rp) as shown in Figure 2.16b. Although the elastoplastic model offers simplicity to numerical calculation, it does not accurately predict the behavior of concrete structures. Saidi et al (1981) suggested that the modified-Clough model which incorporates stiffness degrading in RJC structures is in a better agreement with experimental results. The hysteretic hardening-softening model used in Borzi and Elnashai (1999) studies also yields similar results in predicting reduction factor.

In a recent study, Tong et al (2005) points out that a significant jump is expected in the calculated spectrum for R-factor using modified-Clough model as shown in Figure 2.17a, which is most of the time eliminated in direct averaging process used by pervious researchers. The rise in the suggested spectrum as shown in Figure 2.17b, appears where the period of vibration (1) is in the vicinity of characteristic period of ground motion (T8 ) in different soil conditions. This is believed to be due to the resonance of large displacement characteristics of structure with seismic wave, which leads to a significant . increase in efficiency of seismic reduction. 30

Seismic reduction factor (R) for RIC elevated towers is specified ~s 2.0 in ASCE 7-05 for conventional detailing and 3.0 for special detailing where ample circumferential ties are provided. It should be noted that the recommended value in legal documents may be under influence of country's economical and political status since in most cases, seismic reduction factor controls a significant portion of construction cost.

Performance of RIC shaft staging elevated water tanks in recent earthquakes

Elevated water tank is a conventional potable-water storage system in many rural areas of India. Following the Bhuj earthquakes in January 26, 2001., several water towers experienced minor to severe damages and in some cases damages led to total collapse of structure. The epicenter of that earthquake was determined to be at 65 krn North-East of city of Bhuj in Gujarat province with a relatively large magnitude (Mw) of 7.6 as shown in Figure 2.18a. Although, the seismic waveform was not recorded through special seismographic instruments, the seismic data was generated and analyzed using the data registered through other geological accelerometers by Iyengar and Kanth (2002). The analysis suggests a maximum Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) value of 0.34g EastWest, 0.38g North-East directions and 0.38g vertically in Bhuj area as shown in Figure 2.18b. 31

In an extensive field survey by Rai in 2001 and 2002, as many as 26 elevated water towers were visited and a comprehensive damage assessment report was prepared. Among 26 visited structures, 19 water towers with the capacity range of 80 to 2000 m3 were built with reinforced concrete shaft staging structural system as listed in Table 2.2. In almost all of standing structures, flexural cracks are observed near the base. Although the development of circumferential cracks is not necessarily an indication of flaw, it promotes the probability of flexural vulnerability.

Rai (2001) re-evaluates the strength of selected shaft staging's and compares the results with code recommended design loads. In his analysis, Rai used SDOF model as it is acceptable by applicable design codes. Cracking moment (Mer) was estimated using the following simplified equation,

33

-y P M cr ft=-;__-+ - 21trt 2 1t r t

Eq. 2.36

In above equation, y is load factor which is taken as 0.9 since the effects of gravity loads
(P) is in favor of cracking moment, and r is the mean radius of the wall and t is wall

thickness. The tensile strength of concrete (J,) is calculated as follows,

fr=0.1~fck

Eq. 2.37

Where, f ck is the characteristic strength of concrete as per Indian Standard (IS). Rai (2001) concludes that the ultimate flexural strength of shaft calculated based on Pinfol (1989) is not significantly larger that the cracking moment. Hence, the cracking moment is a fair estimation of ultimate flexural strength for comparison as presented in Table 2.3

The shear strength of the structure was calculated in accordance with ACI 371-98 considering wall openings and torsional effects. Based on dynamic properties of the water tower, the seismic demand was calculated according to International Building Code IBC 2000 and Indian Standard IS : 1893 (1984, 1998 and 2002) as shown in Figure 2.20. As analysis reveals, while all investigated water towers were well above seismic demand based on IS : 1893 (1984 ), none of them meet the strength requirement of IBC 2000, which explains excessive crack pattern observed on shaft circumference.

Rai (2001) concludes that IS: 1893 (1984) over-estimated the ductility of shaft staging and allowed for higher reduction factor. If the supporting structure of elevated water towers had been deigned precisely up to the Code recommended level of seismic demand, far greater damage and destructions would have been seen in aftermath of Bhuj earthquake. In the latest version of Indian code the R-factor is reduced to 2.0 following IBC 2000.

Earthquake Loads

Using seismic ground motion and long period transition maps available from ASCE 72005, mapped spectral response acceleration parameters (Ss and S 1) were selected for an active region in San Francisco area in United States as l.Og and 0'.57g respectively. Once regional seismic parameters were selected, elastic seismic acceleration spectrum was determined for rock-site condition following the procedure prescribed in ASCE 7-05 and ACI 371-08 as described in Appendix C. Elastic response spectra was then adjusted to incorporate the importance factor of (I) of 1.5 and seismic reduction fact (R) of 2.0, as recommended for concrete shaft staging as follows, S D 1 I S DS I ~ Cs =max [ min ( T R , R ,0.044S DS ~ = 0.22

Once seismic shear coefficient ( Cs) was calculated, the design base shear was determined as follows.

Calculated design base shear (V101a 1) is then used to determine lateral load, shear and overturning moment at each level of shaft as shown in Table 3.1.

Design for Earthquake Loads

After axial and lateral loads were determined, the vertical and horizontal reinforcements were designed accordingly as described in Appendix Q. The theory of short columns was used to calculate the stress distribution in the cross section based on MacGregor (1997) and Nawy (2005). In order to simplify manual calculations, the longitudinal reinforcements which are usually placed in two wall-layers (i.e. inner and outer layers) were replaced with an equivalent steel ring, maintaining the same longitudinal reinforcement ratio as shown in Figure 3.2.

Since the ratio of shaft length to the diameter is fairly large (Lw I hw

= 4.66), in manual

calculation it was assumed that the strain variation in the cross section remained linear in the region 0.5dw above the base, and the cross-section did not exhibit distortion and warping. Thus, assuming a linear strain variation in the cross section, the stress in concrete and reinforcement can be calculated anywhere in the cross section as shown in Figure 3.2b, based the non-linear stress-strain relationship in concrete and reinforcements as described in the next Chapter.

Assuming that maximum flexural strength will be achieved when the extreme concrete fiber in compression reaches the ultimate compressive strain (t:cu) of 0.003, the amount of axial force created in the section can be easily calculated by integration over area of cross-section for corresponding depth of neutral axis (c) as follows,

Eq.3.3

Similarly, bending moment can be expressed as,

Eq. 3.4

In above equations, parameter c is the depth of neutral axis which varies between oo and
Cmin

as axial load eccentricities changes from 0 to oo respectively. Also, rw is the mean

radius of wall, and hs is the equivalent thickness of reinforcement ring. The shear strength of cross section is calculated according to the procedure prescribed in ACI 371R-08 where nominal shear strength (V11 ) is, Vn

= (a c Jf/ c + P s_horizf)

A cv

Thus, ultimate shear strength is then calculated as follows, V r = min( <P v V n· V u_maJ = 5.74 MN

Eq.3.8

At final stage of design, the calculated axial and flexural strengths are used to construct the axial/lateral strength interaction diagram near the base of the structures as shown in Figure 3.3. The shear strength and axial buckling strength of the shaft is also shown on the interaction diagram along with factored axial and lateral design loads.

The ratio of vertical reinforcements (ps_verr) and horizontal reinforcements (ps_hoiz) are determined as 1.61% and 0.29%, respectively. The required ratio of reinforcement satisfies the ACI 371-08 minimum vertical and horizontal reinforcement ratio requirements of 0.5% and 0.25% respectively for the design l.Os period acceleration response (SDJ) greater than 0.20g.

FINITE ELEMENT MODEL

The finite element model (FEM) of the structure was prepared in ANSYS® environment, which was available through computer laboratory of department of mechanical engineering, Ryerson University. The techniques used for FE modeling in ANSYS® environment and computer programming language were adopted from Lawrence (2005), Nakasone et al (2006) and the online tutorial available form department of mechanical engineering of University of Alberta (2001). Pervious studies on non-linear RIC FE models by Barbosa et al (1998), Xiao (2000) and Zho et al (2000) in ANSYS environment were also considered as a reference for selection of proper elements and equation solvers.

Concrete

Concrete material was modeled using the implicit Soild65 element as shown in Figure 4.1, where cracking and crushing is simulated by modifying element stiffens matrix.

Concrete in Tension

The behavior of concrete material in tension prior to cracking is modeled as linear elastic and the stiffness matrix is considered isotropic. Thus, the stress-strain relationship ( [a]= [Dl[cr]) for an un-cracked concrete element in FEM is specified as follows,

Upon increasing tensile stresses in concrete specimen, when the tensile stress reaches the tensile strength of concrete, cracks develop normal to direction of stress. In an unreinforced concrete specimen, concrete exhibits no tensile strength beyond its cracking. Even though the material property is the same in reinforced and un-reinforced concrete, the tensile reinforcement bonded with concrete utilizes the tensile strength of remaining un-cracked length of the specimen, causing an increase in the overall tensile strength of the reinforces concrete element. The synergy between reinforcement and concrete which is called stress relaxation can be calculated based on Stevens et al. ( 1987) knowing ratio and diameter of reinforcement as shown in Figure 4.2a. A numerical technique 1s employed in Solid 65 for handling the stress relaxation phenomenon as illustrated m Figure 4.2b. In this method an initial value is specified for relaxation parameter (Tc) by the user. As the analysis progress, the value of Tc is gradually reduced from initial value. Once tensile strain reaches six times the cracking strain (6cck), the relaxation parameter is set to zero as shown in Figure 4.2b.

The development of tensile cracks in the element is simulated by applying tensile stress relaxation coefficient (R 1) , shear transfer coefficient for open cracks (/3 1 = 0.1) and close cracks (/Jc = 0.9) . Using these parameters cracking in one, two or three directions can be modeled in concrete element simultaneously. The stiffness matrix for the concrete after opening of cracks in one direction which is expected to appear in horizontal plane of front and back walls (i.e. portion of shaft wall perpendicular to direction of seismic acceleration) is adjusted as follows,

Concrete Behavior in Compression

In this study, the stress-strain response of concrete element in compression is adopted form the relationship suggested by Carrsquillo, Nilson and Slate (1981) for unconfined concrete. The modulus of elasticity of concrete (Ec) at elastic stage is calculated as follows,

45

Ec = 3320~ F c + 6900

Eq.4.6

The modulus of elasticity (Ec) is used to calculate the compressive stress in elastic region of response, where the compressive strain is equal to 0.0002 or less. The compressive stress beyond 0.0002 is calculated as follows,

In this model, un-loading and re-loading stiffness are equal to initial modulus of elasticity of concrete (Ec) . However, the experimental results suggest that reloading · stiffness is somewhat softer. Upon entering the nonlinear phase, a non-recoverable plasticity is generated. In higher compressive strain reign, the material exhibits strain-softening qualities, which is not easily achieved in ANSYS and requires using proper equation solver and relaxing few of convergence criterions

4.2

Reinforcement

Longitudinal and shear reinforcements are modeled using available Link8 element, which is a 3-dimensional truss element with tension and compression capabilities. The Bi-linear Isotropic (BISO) hardening material model is selected to model the elastic-plastic stressstrain behavior of longitudinal and horizontal reinforcements as shown in Figure 4.4.

Elevated Tank

Once the material properties of concrete and reinforcement are determined, the geometry of the structure is introduced to the finite element model as shown in Figure 4.5. In the developed model, a total of 240 size 35M longitudinal reinforcement are placed at inner and outer surface of the wall at 392 mm spacing
(ps_iong.

= 1.61%). Similarly, the 15M

circumferential (horizontal) shear reinforcements are placed at inner and outer layers of the wall at 410 mm spacing along the length of shaft (ps_horiz.

= 0.29%).

Additionally, in order to facilitate any future changes in geometry, mesh size and material properties, the entire finite element model was programmed as a compatible parametric text file. Although a single mass element was used to model the entire impulsive mass of water, the geometry and material properties of steel tank and fluid (water) are also devised in the finite element input text file for future development

GENERALIZED SINGLE DEGREE OF FREEDOM SYSTEM

Theory

Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) approximation of a given structure is possible when a dominating mode of vibration can be identified and extracted from the system, and the movement of each component of the structure can be defined based on a generalized coordinate system (Z(t)). Using this concept, a lump mass approximation of vibrating system can be used to establish a mathematical model of elevated water tank. A similar concept is also used in equivalent lateral force procedure in ACI 371-98 and in modified version ACI 371-08. Following the generalized SDOF concept, the flexural response of first mode of vibration of elevated water tower can be quantified as per Figure 5.1 .

Figure 5.1 - Response of first mode of vibration of elevated water tower

In Figurer 5.1, m and m(x) are the concentrated mass of water and distributed mass of the concrete shaft respectively. v8(t), vt(x,t) and v(x,t) are lateral ground movement, total and
jj(x,t) and relative lateral displacement along the length of the structure respectively. P e

P(t) are the lateral forces of earthquake on the structural masses (m(x) and m) initiated

50

from ground acceleration (v 8 (t)). Using virtual energy method (c5WE = c5W1), the generalized dynamic equilibrium can be written as follows,
d2

d

= p* efr(t)

Eq.S.l

where m*, c* and k* are generalized mass, damping and stiffness respectively; and k*c is the geometric stiffness which is initiated from gravity loads and has negative effect on overall structural stiffness. It should be noted that the effect of gravity in increasing fundamental period of vibration is usually neglected in code-prescribed equations. In above equation, P*eff(t) is the effective lateral earthquake force and is the product of ground acceleration and structural mass. The described dynamic parameters are calculated as follows,

Shape function

As shown in Figure 5.1 relative displacement of shaft along the length (v(x,t)) is defined based on relative displacement of center of gravity of water (Z( t )) and the shape function
(lf!(x)). Any mathematical function chosen to represent the shape function (1/f(X)), must

satisfy two general criteria. Firstly, any selected shape function must satisfy the boundary conditions of displacement shape of the structure, which are zero lateral displacement and zero rotation at the base (lf/(0) =lfl '(O) = 0). In addition, since the bending moment at the top of the structures is evidently zero, the curvature at the top also must be zero (1/f " (L)=
'" ~I
,,,
II
~I

I., I

0). Secondly, the true shape of vibrating structure applies the least external constrains on the structure and consumes the least energy. Thus, it yields the lowest angular frequency of vibration (w) or the highest period of vibration (T).

!! ,,

While the validity of boundary conditions can be verified without difficulty, the energy property of a shape function is calculated in many steps and the results from other shape functions must also be considered in order to reach a conclusion. In the first attempt, the initial buckling shape of a cantilevered column calculated based on Rayleigh's method of buckling analysis, is selected as follows,

Eq.5.9

Once the boundary conditions are confirmed, the accuracy of the shape function is then verified through application of Rayleigh's principal of energy conservation method. In this method, a distributed lateral load proportional to shape functions is applied to the structure which simulates the maximum velocity state in free vibration. The corresponding displacement function and shape function is calculated. Based on energy 52

conservation theory, the kinematic energy due to initial distributed load must equate the potential energy of the calculated shape function. Following the Rayleigh's method, an angular frequency can be calculated for each assumed shape function. By testing different shape function, the one that produces the lowest angular frequency, yields the best approximation for shape function. In order to optimize the initial assumptions for shape function, the described process is applied to the elevated water tower at empty and full conditions. Additionally, a free vibration FEA is performed using developed FEM of elevated water tower in full tank conditions, and the displacement function of the fundamental mode of vibration is extracted from the output. The results form theoretical and FE analyses are illustrated in Figure 5.2a and 5.2b.

Considering Figure 5.2a and 5.2b, the theoretical responses of the structure to a distributed load proportionate to initial shape function (If/I) a.t empty and full tank conditions, suggests a larger displacement near the base of structure, which is an indication of shear displacement. The shape functions are adjusted and re-applied several times as a lateral load to structure at the empty and full conditions. Subsequently, the following optimized shape functions were determined to yield the lowest frequency of vibration at empty and full tank condition respectively,

and,

FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS

Static Non-Linear Finite Element Push-Over Analysis

In this Chapter, a FE push-over analysis is performed to verify the assumption of linear strain distribution which were made earlier in the manual design process. Additionally, the maximum available ductility and structural responses to lateral load are also determined through push-over analysis.

In order to resemble actual loading sequence, the axial gravity load is applied to the structure first. After application of gravity loading, lateral load is applied in several load steps. Since the compressive strength of concrete is reduced after reaching the peak compressive strength (strain softening), special attention should be paid in choosing a proper equation solver to avoid numerical instability and convergence predicaments. There are three built-in numerical solvers available in ANSYS® for static analysis as shown in Figure 6.1. Although there are certain advantages and disadvantage in using each method, the modified Newton-Rophson method is concluded to be a suitable solver since the initial slope is used in the analysis. This is less likely to encounter numerical instability due to stiffness softening.

In order to verify the theoretically developed axial-lateral strength interaction diagram, a total of eight static push-over analyses are performed using the FEM. In each case, a different axial gravity load is applied to the structure, and then the ultimate lateral strength is calculated by gradually increasing the concentrated lateral force at the centroid of impulsive water pressure. All of the obtained results are illustrated in theoretical strength interaction diagram for comparison as shown in Figure 6.2.

Figure 6.2 - Ultimate structural strength determined through FEA (o), illustrated in theoretical axial-lateral strength interaction diagram.

56

The FE results appear to be in a good agreement with theoretical strength, calculated at

0.5dw above the base of the structure with linear strain distribution and un-confined
concrete material properties.

Furthermore, the general pattern observed in FEA results follows the curvature of theoretical axial-flexural strength interaction diagram suggesting a flexural mode of failure and rejecting the possibility of shear failure. This is despite the fact that calculated ultimate lateral strength in shear is considerably smaller than the one in flexure. As pointed out before, the beneficial effects of axial load in shear strength is disregarded in ACI 371-08 recommendation for shear strength calculations. This explains the absence of shear of failure in this particular structure.

In the next step, two more non-linear push-over FEA are performed on the structure under actual gravity loads. In the first loading case, a concentrated lateral load is applied in much finer load steps to the centroid of impulsive pressure on the tank wall. In the second loading case, the lateral load is applied to the structure as a lateral constant inertial acceleration .. In each analysis, the lateral load is gradually increased while the structure reaches near-collapse conditions. The results of FEA are used to investigate the development of shear force at the base of the structure for every lateral displacement at centroid of water mass as illustrated in Figure 6.3

As shown in Figure 6.3, the response of structure to lateral loads appears to be linear elastic within the first 50 mm of lateral displacement at the top, where the tensile stresses in all of the longitudinal reinforcements are below the yield stress limit ([y). As lateral load continues to increase, the first yield of reinforcement is observed when 2.9 MN and 3.3 MN base shear is developed at base and lateral displacement exceeds 53 mm and 58 mm in lateral concentrated and acceleration loading cases respectively. Using the obtained FEA results, structural stiffness (Ke) at elastic stage is calculated as 50.0 MN/m and 62.3 MN/m in each loading cases of lateral concentrated and constant acceleration respectively. These values are close to the elastic structural stiffness (Kc) of 58.1 MN .m calculated according simplified method of ACI 371-98. 57

For the two cases of lateral concentrated and lateral constant acceleration loadings, an ultimate base shear of 5.7MN and 6.8MN is recorded respectively at base of structure which is accompanied with 236.6 MN.m and 274.7 MN.m bending moment. The maximum lateral displacement of centroid of the tank is determined to be 347 mm and 361mm in lateral concentrated and acceleration loading cases respectively.

As shown in Figure 6.3, the structure is capable of demonstrating a considerable amount of lateral displacement prior to failure, which is near the maximum lateral drift limit (L1max
= O.Olhs) as recommended by ASCE 7-05 for post-disaster structures. However, large

lateral displacement does not necessarily imply large ductility as discussed in Chapter 7.

One of the assumptions in the design process was that the horizontal cross section of shaft will not experience warping at elevation of 0.5dw above the ground. In order to verify this assumption, the nodal vertical displacement in non-linear static push-over analysis was extracted from results. Then, using statistical regression method, a 61h degree polynomial curve was fitted to vertical displacement variation in each plane as shown in Figure 6.4.

As expected, structure exhibits non-linear variation of vertical displacement or warping adjacent to foundation where it is rigidly connected. The identified disturbed region extends as much as 2.47 m or 0.33dw. The neutral axis has been identified to be located at

Similarly, a distinguished non-linearity has been identified in the region near the base extending as high as 2.471 m. Although an intense and highly non-linear behavior appears in the tensile region near the base, it gradually fades away as ascending along the length of the shaft. Thus, the assumption for linear strain variation becomes practically valid at height of 0.5dw.

Non-Linear Time-History (Transient) Finite Element Analysis

In the next stage of this study, the FEM of elevated water tank was subjected to seismic ground motions. During the transient analysis, the vertical gravitational acceleration (g) was kept constant similar to static push-over analysis and it was applied prior to start of transient loading during the first 5 seconds of analysis in order to set the initial conditions.

While two general approaches of Direct Integration (or Time-History) and Mode Superposition methods exist for dynamic analysis, the nonlinear behavior of structure is better handled in Direct Integration method where loads can be applied through an array of lateral accelerations registered in an episode of ground excitation and response of structure are calculated at small time steps (Llt) through equilibrium of forces. Several techniques have been developed over time, such as centr<U difference, average acceleration, Newmark method, etc, which employ either implicit or explicit approach for solving equation of motion.

The approach adopted in ANSYS is generally an implicit method. However, explicit nonlinear software (LS-DYNA) is integrated into in later versions of this program. In general, implicit analysis requires special attention, as solution is found through several iterations which may sometimes lead to numerical instability and convergence issues. In addition matrix inversion which is a part of calculation may halt the analysis progress upon encountering singularities. Also, non-linearities are not very well handled in implicit method. On the other hand explicit methods have none of these obstructions but they may require extremely small time stepping for accurate analysis.

In this study the modified-Newmark solver is used for analysis which is in fact an implicit technique. Among other implicit techniques, Newmark method
o~

modified-

Newmark method is believed to be the most accurate which is adopted by many researchers.

6.2.1

Selection of Seismic Ground Motions

While many historic seismic acceleration records are available through online sources, a total of 4 recent earthquakes are selected from database of United States Federal Emergency Management Agency's training software (NONLIN® v6.0), based on their energy content and characteristic period of vibration (T8 ) as shown in Figure 6.6. The seismic records were selected in such a way that a large portion of the seismic energy is delivered within the frequency ranges that includes the period of vibration of the structure in linear and non-linear phases. Although any other seismic motion could have been used for dynamic analysis regardless of its energy distribution, selecting an earthquake that targets the fundamental mode of vibration of structure would reduce the influence of secondary modes of vibrations. The energy content of selected ground motions were evaluated through Fourier amplitude spectrum as shown in Figure 6. 7.

Since the magnitude of seismic Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) varies between 0.15g and 0.636g in the selected earthquakes, the seismic accelerations are normalized for use in FEA in order to eliminate the intensity of each earthquake. During the normalization process, the ground acceleration data are divided by the peak ground acceleration of the earthquake. The acceleration data are then magnified until a single PGA is found for each record that produces the same elastic spectral response as the design spectral accelerations (Figure 6.8). Using the calculated PGA as an indicator of earthquake intensity, a total 50 PGA's are selected for FEA. The seismic acceleration data used in FEA are available only in 0.02s time intervals in the database of FEMA.

However, when necessary for convergences and stability of Newmark-Hall iterative solver in time-history analysis, time intervals are reduced to O.Ols and 0.005s, and intermediary data are generated by averaging available records. Additionally, the less active interval of seismic excitation was discarded; in order to minimize the amount of time elapsed in computer analysis.

Results of Time-History Analysis

After performing over 50 time-history non-linear finite element analyses and gathering over 600 GB of data, 29 conclusive results were obtained which were later used to extract necessary information. In each set of analysis, the maximum non-linear lateral displacement of structure and its corresponding base-shear was determined. Some of the key structural responses at maximum displacement were quantified as illustrated in Table 6.1 along with results of linear time-history analysis.

As results of FEA suggest, the structure exhibits a linear elastic response when it was subjected to a low magnitude earthquake, despite the development of tensile cracks. As earthquake intensity increases, the tensile crack region expands and covers over 50% of structure's height (Figure 6.9a and b). However, the horizontal tensile cracks in the actual structure may be visible only near the base. A secondary set of horizontal and diagonal cracks were also observed on the walls parallel to the seismic excitation as shown in Figure 6.9c. The secondary cracks which are attributed to the shear stresses are distributed near the centerline and extend as far as 50% of shaft height.

The first signs of tensile yielding of vertical reinforcements were observed at region below 0.5dw with low magnitude of seismic accelerations. As structure was subjected to stronger ground motions, the percentage of yielded longitudinal reinforcements also increased, ultimately reaching to 45% of total reinforcing at time of failure. Compressive stress in concrete also increased correspondingly as earthquake PGA was amplified.

Maximum shear stresses were observed near 0.5dw of the base of structure. The average shear stress in concrete was calculated approximately as 1.2MPa which is within the tolerance recommended by ACI 318-08 as 1.0MPa and 1.5MPa. The parabolic shear stress distribution was observed only in upper region of the shaft where the structure is still un-cracked as shown in Figure 6.10. The idealized uniform shear stress distribution suggested by ACI 318-08 was also observed in central region of the shaft. However the shear stress in concrete at critical lower section is highly non-linear and is controlled by 66

characteristic of concrete smeared crack model. A significant concentration of shear stresses was observed near the center line of the shaft at the base which is believed to be initiated from fixed support conditions.

The hysteretic lateral displacements at the centroid of impulsive mass of water during the maximum seismic excitations are shown in Figure 6.12, along with corresponding applied seismic acceleration. Comparing the lateral acceleration with the corresponding displacement response, the peak lateral displacement appears when the frequency of seismic acceleration is within the frequency range of inelastic structure.

The hysteretic base-shear variations of the structures for corresponding seismic waves are also illustrated in Figure 6.13. The development of maximum base shear in the structure appears at same time as maximum displacement at the top. This is believed to be due to flexural response of the structure to the seismic excitations.

The hysteretic displacements at centroid of tank and base-shear data are then combined to generate the structural response of FE model as sho,wn in Figure 6.14. The base shear lateral displacement plot of seismic response suggests that a nominal amount of ductility exists in the system.

Figure 6.16- Maximum linear and non-linear structural responses shown in static push-over graph

As shown in Figure 6.16, the maximum non-linear seismic responses are slightly greater than the response due to concentrated lateral load. But these values are less than those subjected to lateral constant inertial acceleration indicating the non-linear distribution of inertial forces along the shaft structure during seismic excitation. The relationship between linear and non-linear structural responses is discussed in the next Chapter of this thesis.

CALCULATION OF RESPONSE MODIFICATION FACTOR

Static Push-Over Analysis Approach

Following the procedure prescribed by Applied Technology Council (ATC-19 1995) the seismic modification factor (R) can be estimated based on the non-liner static push-over response of structure to lateral load. In this study, the non-liner static push-over response of structure to a constant lateral inertial acceleration was used to develop an elastic perfectly plastic model based on energy method by equating area A 1 and A2 as shown in Figure 7 .1. Thus, the yield displacement (uy) and yield base shear (Vy) are determined as 184 mm and 6.8 MN respectively based on the elasto-plastic model.

Lateral Displacement, U (mm)
Figure 7.1 - Elasto plastic approximation of non-linear responses of structure

As discussed in pervious Chapters, the structure is capable of demonstrating a substantial amount of lateral displacement and reaching the maximum lateral drift limit prior to failure. However, this does not ensure that the structure possess a large ductility (J.tc). The ductility ratio (J1.c) is calculated as the ratio of maximum displacement (um) to yield displacement (uy) as follows,

Jl

=-u y = = 1.96 c 184
76

urn

361

Eq. 7.1

Once the maximum available ductility (Jic) in the system is determined, the ductility related seismic reduction factor (RJ.J can be calculated using one of available relationships. In this study, the Miranda and Bertero (1994) relationship is used to calculate RJJ as follows, R J.l = ---;- + 1 = 2.24

J..L-1

Eq. 7.2

where the coefficient C/J for rock site condition is calculated as,
__I_ e- 1.5 (ln(T)-0.6) 2

<1>=1+

1

=

O. 773

Eq. 7.3

lOT- J.l T

2T

In above equation the value of fundamental period of vibration (I) and ductility ratio (jl) are taken as 1.27s and 1.96 rnrnlmm respectively. The overst:ength related seismic modification factor (Rs) is the other component of R and it is calculated as the ratio of maximum available strength of structure (Vm) to design base shear (Vd) as follows,

R

Vm 6.8MN --- 1.21 s- V d - 5.6MN

Eq.7.4

In above equation, the design base shear (Vd) is the factored strength of structure obtained from theoretical calculation. Subsequently, seismic reduction factor (R) can be calculated as the product of ductility, over-strength and redundancy related reduction factors as follows,
R = R J.l R s R R = 2.24 X 1.21 X 1.00 = 2.7
Eq. 7.5

Where, the redundancy related reduction factor (RR) is taken as 1.0 since no reliable redundancy is available in the system. It should be noted that the relationship used to calculate the ductility related modification factor (RJJ) does net incorporate the specific characteristic of earthquakes for rock site conditions. However, the characteristic period of earthquake is considered for soft soil conditions. 77

In order to investigate the influence vertical reinforcement ratio (ps_horiz) in variation of seismic reduction factor (R), the structure was designed for two lower MCE acceleration response spectra (S1) of 0.43g and 0.35g (Appendix E). The required amount of vertical reinforcement (ps_horiz) was determined as 0.75% and 0.50% in each case respectively. Following the static push-over approach the seismic reduction factor (R) was calculated as 3.43 and 3.65 in each case respectively.

7.2

Non-linear Time-History Analysis Approach

As an alternate method, a better estimation of actual seismic reduction factor (R) can be achieved through time-history non-linear analysis as suggested by ATC-19 (1995). Using available data, seismic force reduction/modification factor (R) was calculated for each time-history analysis as the ratio of maximum linear elastic base-shear (Ve) to maximum inelastic base-shear (V;e) as follows ,

Eq. 7.6

Additionally, the corresponding value of maximum ductility demand (p.d) in each case was calculate as the ratio of maximum inelastic displacement (u;e) to yield displacement
(uyieLd) as follows,

u ie lld=-u yield

Eq. 7.7

The variation of seismic reduction factor (R) for different ductility demands (p.d) are then illustrated in Figure 7.2 for each set of seismic
excitatio~ s.

Using a statistical regression

technique, 2"d and 3rd degree polynomial curves are fitted to each set of data. As analytical data suggests, R-factor increases upon increasing earthquake intensity which is expressed in the form of ductility demand. This increase is anticipated since in equation

78

7.6, the elastic response of structure (Ve) increases linearly while inelastic response (Vie) remains approximately constant. This behavior is also in agreement with experimental results presented in ATC-19 (1995). The statistical fitted curve also implies that the growth of seismic reduction factor eventually stabilizes and converges to a distinct value in each case as earthquake intensity reaches its maximum sustainable amplitude.

Additionally, the converged values of R-factors are different in each earthquake (1.6, 2.2, 2.5 & 3.5) which signifies the influence of earthquake characteristic on response of structure. This feature is distinguished in NBCC-05 by limiting the seismic accelerations used in time-history analysis to those which produce the similar elastic response curve as specified in the Code.

79

The influence of characteristic period of earthquake or pre-dominant period of ground motion (Tg) in ductility related reduction factor (R11 ) is also identified by many researcher and its effects is particularly studied in detail by Tong et al (2007). However, these studies are generally performed on mathematically developed elastic perfectly-plastic models for a wide range of fundamental period of vibrations (1) and the influence of different earthquakes on one model is eliminated during averaging process.

In order to investigate the influence of each seismic record on structural response, the variation of R-factor for different characteristic periods (Tg) are plotted in Figure 7.3. After further investigations, no explicit relationship has been indentified between two parameters. This is because the characteristic period merely represents the period of vibration of a 5% damped SDOF system which receives the maximum input energy, and no additional information is provided to unfold the characteristic of the entire response spectra.

However, a rational relationship can be established between R-factor and the ratio of dynamic responses of linear elastic model and equivalent elastic linear/bi-linear/tri-linear systems
(Vetastic

I

V equiv. elastic).

The structural stiffness of equivalent linear/bi-linear/tri-

linear elastic SDOF systems are approximations of dynamic hysteretic response of 80

structure to setsrmc excitations as shown in Figure 7.4a. Using the equivalent elastic models, the response to the seismic excitation is calculated using Newmark-Hall step-bystep method (Clough and Penzien 2003, Chopra 1995) and the results are shown in Figure 7 .4b, 7 .4c and 7 .4d.

Although the results from equivalent models are in general agreement with response modification factor (R), they fail to offer a simple definitive prediction of seismic reduction factor. Additionally, calculating an equivalent structural stiffness requires painstaking statistical analysis by averaging force-displacement time-history plot which yields inconsistence values for each seismic record.

In a different approach as suggested in this study, the inelastic period of vibration of structure (Tie) with maximum displacement reaching 0.01 h can be easily extracted from lateral displacement histogram as shown in Figure 6.11. Alternatively, it can be obtained from a large displacement finite element analysis. Unlike linear/bi-linear/tri-linear stiffness models, the inelastic period of vibration (Tie) is nearly consistent in all four seismic records and it is determined to be 35% larger than elastic period of vibration (Te) as follows,

Tie= 1.336 T e = 1.336 x 1.28 s = 1.71 s Since the fundamental period of vibration of structure was identified to vary between Te and Tie. the displacement response spectra of four seismic records have been calculated for duration of 1.1 s
~

T

~

1. 8 s. In order to eliminate the influence of earthquake

intensity, the spectra are normalized based on maximum spectral responses calculated for this range. As shown in Figure 7.5, for seismic records a, b and d the dynamic displacement response increases with increase in period of vibration. This pattern corresponds to FEM results where non-linear maximum displacements are greater than linear responses. On the other hand in Figure 7 .Sc, dynamic displacement response diminishes despite the increase in period of vibration. A similar pattern is also observed in non-linear responses in the third seismic record as shown in Figure 7.5c.

Similarly, the normalized spectral acceleration responses are plotted for the specified period as shown in Figure 7.6. Although as a general trend, the acceleration response spectra declines as period of vibrations increases in the specified range, it does not follow a smooth line and in fact it might experience local fluctuations which might influence the final results.

Figure 7.7- Variation of seismic reduction factor (R) vs. ratio of spectral responses of elastic and inelastic period of vibrations

Thus considering Figure 7.7, the R-factor can be approximated as follows, Sa(T e)
Eq. 7.8

Sa(T ie) In above equation, Sa(Te) and Sa(Tie) are (normal) spectral acceleration responses of elastic and inelastic systems respectively. Coefficient o. is calculated as 1.30 and it is believed to be attributed to available reserved strength in the system. As suggested in equation 7.8, the variation of seismic reduction factor is independent of earthquake intensity and is closely related to frequency content of seismic wave. Thus, using the spectral acceleration response curve of ASCE 7-05 which is developed based on a large number of past earthquake patterns, an average value R-factor can be calculated as follows,

R=a.

for the structures with period of vibration greater than short period of vibration limit (Ts) but less than the transition long period of vibrations (h). In above equation, SDJ is design acceleration spectra for 1.00s period structures. The above equation can be further simplified as,

Eq. 7.10

Substituting the numerical values m above equation, seismic reduction factor (R) calculated as, 1.77 s = 1.30x - = 1.80 1.28 s

IS

R

Thus, considering the coefficients of elastic acceleration response curve and following the suggested method , the seismic reduction factor (R) is calculated as 1.8, which is 10% smaller than the ASCE 7-0S's recommended value of 2.0 and it is about 33% and 25% smaller than the value of 2.7 and 2.4 obtained from static and time-history analysis respectively. It should be noted that since the purpose of reduction factor is to make use of all reserved strength available in the structure, the FEM was prepared without applying strength reduction factor (cp) to the material properties.

Similarly, using the prescribed method of National Building Code of Canada (NBCC), design spectral acceleration values can be calculated as, S(T)
=

Fv Sa (1.0 s)

Eq. 7.11

and, S(T)

= Fv Sa (2.0 s)

Eq. 7.12

86

ForT= l.Os and 2.0s, and intermediate values can be calculated using linear interpolation as follows, T- 1.0 s 2.0 s - 1.0 s

S(T)=Fv ( Sa(2.0s)-Sa(l.Os) )

+FvSa(l.Os)

Eq. 7.13

After substituting the above equation in equation 7.6, the simplified equation for R-factor can be expressed as follows,

Eq. 7.14

Where,

S a(2.s0)- 2S aCLO s)
~=------

s a(2.0 s)- S aCl.O s)

Eq. 7.15

As NBCC' s (2005) provided seismic data suggests, the curvature of spectral acceleration response curve varies locally. Thus, the outcome of equation 7.14 will be also influenced by local seismic data. Substituting the prescribed local spectral response data in equation 7.14, R-factors were calculated for different regions of Canada and the results are plotted in Figure 7 .8.

Figure 7.8- Variation of seismic reduction factor, R, calculated based on NBCC's regional mapped spectral acceleration response parameters; Sa(2.0s) and S0 (1.0s).

It has been identified that the value of seismic reduction factor in the studied structure is expected to reduce from 2.5 to 1.6 when moving from the low risk region in the east to higher risk region in West of Canada. In the high risk region the slope of normalized spectral response curvature is smaller than the one in low risk region despite the fact that the seismic spectral response coefficients are larger.

CONCLUSIONS, SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE WORK

8.1

Summary

Being one of the vital infra-structures in many rural and urban areas around the world, elevated water tanks are capable of storing a substantial amount of potable water and potential energy. Besides providing a steady flow of water in peak demand hours of the day, they offer a huge economical advantage over many years of operation by eliminating the need for costly pumping facility. Most importantly, the existences of elevated water tanks become a vital commodity for the survivors of a natural disaster.

Among two conventionally used framing systems for supporting elevated tanks; concrete shaft and structural framing, many design aspects of the latter have previously been identified and improved over many years of extensive research in building industry. However, limited literature exists that explores specific characteristic of concrete shaft supported elevated water tanks and their seismic response in particular. Although the tubular geometry of the shaft offers simplicity and cost efficiency to the construction, it sacrifices the structural performance such as redundancy, toughness, over-strength, energy dissipation, and the most importantly ductility.
I' :I .I

In this study, various design aspects of concrete shaft staging suggested by current codes, guidelines and researches were investigated, in addition to a comprehensive study in advanced dynamics of structure, earthquake engineering and advanced finite element analysis. This study also includes the influence of shaft geometry in the failure modes of buckling and formation of accidental eccentricities, which determines the axial strength of the shaft. The actual and idealized distribution of shear stresses within the cross section in the presentence of wall openings was also studied.

!I

As part of literature review, the dynamic equilibrium of the forces in the single degree of freedom system was briefly explained using the principals of dynamics of structures. Following the fundamentals of elastic response of structure to stochastic loading, the 89

pseudo-spectral response to seismic waveforms and corresponding soil amplification factors were briefly described, the characteristic of code based responses spectra and the prescribed procedure for calculating seismic base shear were also described. Finally, seismic reduction factor which is one of the main features in seismic response calculation is further studied by investigating its notable components such as ductility and overstrength factor in available literatures. The performance of concrete shaft staging elevated water tanks in recent earthquake in India, Bhuj 2001, was also described.

In this thesis the response of a concrete shaft staging elevated water tank, whose geometry was determined from an actual dimensions of an elevated water tank was investigated. However, the wall thickness and ratio of reinforcement was modified to satisfy high seismic demand of the selected location. Following the prescribed method of ACI 371-08 and ASCE 7-05, the lateral seismic demand of the structure was determined using the recommended value of seismic reduction factor (R=2.0). Assuming a linear strain variation in the cross-section, the wall thickness and ratio of vertical and circumferential reinforcements was designed for axial, flexural and shear forces accordingly.

A finite element model of the structure was prepared using available elements in ANSYS. In the FE model, concrete was modeled using solid65 element which is specially designed to model concrete behavior such as cracking, crushing and tensile stress relaxation through modifying stiffness matrix. Additionally, unconfined stress-strain curve was assigned to non-linear concrete material. The reinforcement bars were modeled using available linkS element, which is a 3-dimensional truss element with tension and compression capabilities. A bilinear elasto-plastic stress-strain relationship was used to model the material properties of the reinforcement.

A FE free-vibration analysis was performed to determine the fundamental period of vibration of structure along with displacement function of the shaft. A generalized single degree of freedom model was developed using principals of dynamics of structure for first mode of vibration, where the displacement function for the model was initially

90

defined based on an assumed shape function and displacement of center of impulsive mass of water.

Two static push-over analyses were performed on the model where lateral forces were applied to the structure once in the form of concentrated lateral load to the center of mass and the second time as a lateral acceleration to the entire structure. The results from static push-over analysis were then implemented into the axialllateral force interaction diagram in order to verify the initial design assumption, compare FEM and theoretical calculations. Additionally, the nodal vertical displacement in non-linear static push-over analysis was extracted from results. Then, using statistical regression method, a polynomial curve was fitted to vertical displacement data in each horizontal crosssection. Knowing the variation of nodal displacement throughout the section, total vertical strains between the nodes were determined for the lower section of the shaft.

In the next stage of this study, four seismic records were selected in such a way that the majority of their energy content, as determined through Fourier amplitude spectrum, is delivered throughout the frequency ranges that includes elastic period of vibration and anticipated period of cracked structure. The seismic acceleration records were normalized based on their peak ground accelerations (PGA). Then, a PGA was found for each record that produced the same spectral responses for elastic period of vibration. Using the calculated PGA as an indicator of earthquake intensity, a total 50 PGA' s were selected forFEA.

I. ,,
I,

I

The processed seismic records were then applied to the FEM in the form of lateral inertial acceleration. After performing over 50 non-linear time-history (transient) analyses, 29 conclusive results were obtained. Maximum elastic and inelastic base-shear and maximum displacement at the centroid of the tank in the each set of results were determined, and the structural response and development of stresses, strains and cracks were investigated.

91

I

The seismic reduction factor for the studied structure was calculated first using the nonlinear static pushover analysis approach, and then based on the results of time-history PEA. In an attempt to develop a simplified mathematical model for calculating R-factor, three elastic models were developed with linear, bi-liner and tri-linear approximation of structural stiffens.

Furthermore, a relationship has been established between R factor and spectral responses of elastic and inelastic structure. Using suggested equation, the estimated value of Rfactor was calculated based on the spectral acceleration response data of ACSE 7-05 and NBCC 2005 for different regions of Canada.

8.2

Conclusions

Based on studies performed as described in this thesis, the following conclusions are drawn.

1)

The fundamental period of vibration of un-cracked structure calculated using linear

elastic free-vibration PEA was determined to be 1.12s which is about 12% smaller than 1.27s period calculated based on simplified lumped mass approximation method prescribed by ACI 371-08.

2)

The elastic displacement shape of shaft structure is influenced by the shear

deformation mode shape. This is determined through Rayleigh's principal energy conservation method for optimization of lateral displacement shape function in a generalized single degree of freedom approximation of the structure. An improved equation for approximation of the lateral displacement shape function of shaft structure in empty and full conditions were also suggested which can be used in development of a mathematical elastic models of structure in future.

92

3)

The axial load- bending moment interaction diagram calculated at 0.5dw above the

ground using the suggested mathematical equations for non-linear distribution of stress in the cross section has been verified to be in a good agreement with calculated interaction diagram using static non-linear push-over FEA. The shear strength of structure was also determined to be considerably larger than the estimated value by ACI 318-08 and ACI 371-08, which signifies the beneficial effects of large axial force on shear strength of structure.

4)

The variation of axial strain in the cross-section at time of failure was identified as

nearly linear at 0.33dw over the base and above. However, a significant non-linearity was observed within the disturbed region below 0.33dw elevation due to influence of fixed based connection. The stress-strain response curve of the concrete near the foundation was also influenced by imposed boundary conditions resulting in. nearly 30% increase in specific compressive stress and softer post peak strain softening behavior.

5)

The results of non-linear time-history FEA reveals that the maximum base-shear

developed during each seismic excitation is slightly greater than the calculated base-shear for corresponding displacement in static push-over analysis with lateral concentrated load. However, the response was smaller than uniform lateral inertial acceleration, emphasizing the non-linear distribution of inertial forces along the shaft structure during seismic excitation. Investigating the non-linear response to seismic acceleration at the time of maximum lateral displacement, many horizontal tensile cracks were observed over 50% of the body of the shaft. Additionally, a number of vertical tensile cracks were developed near 0.22dw over base originating from hoop tensile stresses.
I!

6)

Although the maximum compressive stress was observed at the base of structure,

concrete crushing occurred only at about 0.5dw region of the shaft. Furthermore, more than 40% of longitudinal reinforcements in tension experienced inelastic stresses at time of maximum displacement.

93

7)

A parabolic shear stress distribution was observed only in upper region of the shaft

where the structure is still un-cracked. This was transformed into a more uniform shear stress distribution pattern in mid section of the structure with development of tensile cracks. However, an entirely non-liner shear stress distribution with maximum shear stresses of 1.2MPa was observe at critical lower section in the concrete shaft.

8)

Using the energy method for elasto-plastic approximation of structural behavior,

the available capacity of ductility was calculated merely as 1.96, as a low ductility was expected for this type of structures. Similarly, following the prescribed static analysis approach of ATC-19, the seismic reduction/modification factor was calculated approximately as 2.7, which is about 35% larger than the ASCE's prescribed value of2.0. Alternatively, the average value of R-factor was calculated as 2.4 through non-linear time-history finite element analysis, which is still about 17% greater than the codeprescribed value. However, the average reduction factor was calculated using only the results of selected four seismic records

.

9)

Investigating the relationship between seismic record and the calculated reduction

factor, no explicit relationship has been found between the dominant period of vibration of each earthquake (T8 ) and the generated reduction factor. Additionally, the elastic linear/bi-linear/tri-linear approximations of structural behavior did not yield an accurate simplified mathematical model for calculation of maximum dynamic response. However, a close linear relationship was observed between R-factor and the ratio of spectral acceleration responses of elastic and inelastic large displacement period of vibrations. As the suggested relationship implies, the structural performance and amount of seismic force reduction in particular is influenced by the specific characteristic of seismic excitations. Seismic reduction capacity comprised many other factors which may not be affected by characteristic of seismic wave.

94

10)

Following the suggested relationship, the value of reduction factor can be estimated

for any given seismic excitation. While performing a large number of non-linear timehistory FEA was not possible in this study, the ASCE' s standardized seismic response spectra was used instead to generate a better approximation of R factor. Hence, the reduction factor was calculated as 1.8 which is 10% less than ASCE' s recommended value of 2.0.

11)

The R-factor was determined to vary from 1.6 to 2.5 for different regions of Canada

using available local spectral parameters. The highest amount of reduction is suggested for less active regions, since the slope of response acceleration spectra between l .Os and 2.0s normalized at l.Os, is larger than the one in active regions.

:! :it

/ The effects of different support conditions including un-anchored foundation, baseisolation, and soil-structure interaction can be further investigated/

I

The influence of wall openings and intermediate floors on structural strength and behavior can be further investigated and current design approaches can be verified with analytical results/

sloshing of stored water during earthquake can also be investigategl 95

~!though the concrete shaft staging elevated water towers in general do not exhibit a
large amount of ductility as well as redundancy and energy dissipations, they posses a simple geometry which can be defined through limited number of parameters. Thus, it is suggested that seismic reduction factor calculation procedure for elevated water towers to be further developed in order to incorporate the design parameters. This can be used in practice for calculating the actual modification factor, instead of using a single value for
