MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS: AN ERROR CORRECTION AND STATE SPACE APPROACH

ABSTRACT
This paper provides a sectoral examination of the impact of trade policies and custom valuation procedures on estimating time varying import content of Japanese transplant automobiles. Using monthly data from 1985 to 1992, we introduce an error correction model (ECM) and a state space VAR model to purify trade data of measurement errors induced by unobserveable prices and customs valuation procedures. Data show that US import of Japanese auto parts are elastic to the fleet of active Japanese automobiles in the U.S., inelastic to transplant production and that disequilibrium adjustments relative to transplant production are corrected in one period. Further, changes in imports are responsive to the cyclical behavior of Big 3 production and the debt burden of automobile consumers. Moreover, we find that productivity trends in the automotive industry are not a significant determinant of imported parts. The model predicts that Japanese manufacturers will shift more production to the US in response to yen appreciation against the dollar. We show that whereas import content decreased following the Fair Trade in Parts Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, it increased shortly thereafter and predictions are that it will continue to increase. Therefore the empirical evidence suggests that direct trade policies designed to reduce import content and increase domestic sourcing of auto parts are not effective in the long run.

1. INTRODUCTION In 1990 the U.S.-Japan Bilateral Automotive Trade Deficit accounted for 65% of the total U.S.Japan trade deficit and automotive parts comprised approximately 27% of that figure. Thus, the deficit in US-Japan Bilateral Automotive Parts Trade is one of the most urgent contemporary issues facing the economy. This follows from its significance in the overall decline of Big Three market share and massive unemployment due to record financial losses and subsequent plant closings1. As a result, current trade policy is aimed at reducing the automotive trade deficit by reducing the import content of Japanese transplants via increased sourcing of US made autoparts, increasing the amount of auto parts exported to Japan or both2. To facilitate that process, the U.S. Automotive Parts Advisory Committee (APAC) was created by the Fair Trade in Parts Act of 1988, as part of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, for the purpose of advising the Secretary of Commerce on any and all issues related to increasing sales of US made auto parts to Japan. Moreover, the APAC charter is filed with the Senate Committee on Finance; Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; House Committee on Energy and Commerce and House Committee on Ways and Means. Clearly, the automotive parts trade is a major sectoral issue on the agenda of US-Japan Bilateral Trade3. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of current trade policies in mitigating the flow of parts and provide some prognostication based on U.S. customs valuation data. Many researchers of the US automobile industry investigated the welfare effects of quotas and voluntary export restraints (VER) induced by Japanese automobile exporters (see DeMelo and Tarr(1990, 1991), Morke and Tarr (1984), Dinopolous and Krienin (1988), Feenstra (1988)). Adams, Gagnes and Huang (1991) and Adams (1993) posited the positive welfare effects of

Motor Vehicle Parts Act of 1993 (S 1132) to introduce sanctions under section 301 of U.S. trade law against countries that limit access of US autoparts to their markets. Similarly, Senator Max S. Baucus (D-Mont) introduced Bill S 269 to renew provisions in Section 301 ( which was part of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act) to impose sanctions against countries that did not engage in certain trade liberalization practices.

employed a calibration model to compare the difference between an import tariff on Japanese cars and a production subsidy on US made cars and found that production subsidies or domestic antitrust policies were more effective in increasing US real income, versus an import tariff. Another line of inquiry pursued in the literature investigates pricing to market and yen/dollar pass through effects on the automobile manufacturing sector either directly or indirectly (see Krugman (1987), Clarida (1992b), Marston (1990)). Further, in the strategic management and industrial organization literature emphasis is placed on auto parts suppliers relationship with automobile manufacturers in the context of vertical integration or otherwise (Asanamuma (1985a, 1985b), Cusumano and Takeishi (1992), Richardson (1993)). Recently Cooper and Haltiwanger (1993) examined the impact of retooling/machine replacement in the automotive industry on fluctuations in employment and productivity`. This paper fills a void in the literature by analyzing the effectiveness of trade policy on USJapan Bilateral Auto Parts Trade. It focuses on the estimation and implication of time varying (dollar) value of imported Japanese parts4 content in US built transplants (automobiles produced in the US by Japanese subsidiaries). The analysis spans the period before and after implementation of the Fair Trade in Parts Act of 1988 and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. If

trade policy is effective, then one would expect a significant decrease in import content over time otherwise trade policy may be ineffective - at least in the short run. Modelling US-Japan auto parts trade is not without controversy. For instance, the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers of America (JAMA) posit that most of the parts deficit are due to after market sales and Big Three utilization of Japanese parts in domestic production. However, this assertion conflicts with results from studies conducted by the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation5 (OSAT) which show that transplant production is the major source of this deficit. Further, some domestic suppliers are pushing for government sanctions and legal action against Japanese parts imports. They allege that parts dumping and countervailance activities by Japanese manufacturers are injurious to the US auto parts industry and account for a large portion of the Figure 2: Residual Classification Error of Auto Parts Imported from Japan

trade deficit. If these allegations prevail or otherwise permeate domestic political beliefs, then under proposed legislation, they may induce retaliatory action by the US authorities thereby triggering a trade war. To better gauge the magnitude of US imports of autoparts the US Department of Commerce instituted a harmonized tariff schedule on January 1, 1989, to classify imports and assign them accordingly. This created a shock in the time series data and effectively induced a pre and post

harmonized tariff code regime. Most importantly, the new process revealed the pervasiveness of measurement error in the "old" data. Figure 1 shows the time series plot of US imports of Japanese made auto parts before and after the imposition of a harmonized tariff code. Figure 2 depicts the time series plot of the corresponding residual classification error induced by customs valuation arising from from the Tariff schedule of the United States (TSUS) existing in the preharmonization period and the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) in effect on January 1, 1989. Measurement error is most evident in the pre-harmonization (i.e. before January 1, 1989) period. Some analysts have responded to the measurement error problem by discarding pre 1989 data in favor of post-1989 data. However, this procedure 'throws the baby with the bath water' because it jettisons valid information on US-Japan trade during the pre-1989 period. Moreover, it effectively forces analysts to work with smaller samples (in the post harmonization period) from which policy recommendations are made. The relative inefficiency of small sample bias could adversely affect assessments of the bilateral trade. This study measures the impact of policy by providing (1) forecasts and robust estimates of time varying imported Japanese parts content in US transplant automobiles, and (2) estimates of the parameters of long run and short run changes in the auto parts trade. In order to attain these goals we present a simple intertemporal model of US-Japan Auto Parts Trade in Section II. The microfoundations of the model provides guidance and motivation in the choice of variables and or instruments used in the empirical analyses that follow. In Section III we present an example of spurrious regression utilizing levels of trade data and identify more stable results from a comparatively parsimonious model. Next we estimate the long run and short run trade offs in the auto parts trade via an error correction model (ECM). In Section IV we introduce a state space vector autoregressive (VAR) model to provide forecasts of key trade variables in order to augment the sample and provide estimates of the impact of policy on time varying import content. The augmented data set was broken into deciles and a series of rolling regressions were used provided to obtain time varying estimates of import content. Section V is the summary and conclusion.

II. A THEORY OF THE AUTO PARTS TRADE In this section we provide some theoretical motivation for the choice of variables used in the empirical models. Issues affecting the demand for automotive parts are explored. In the manufacturing sector we assume that firms follow the neoclassical paradigm of profit maximization. In the consumer sector we utilize a representative agent approach to automobile consumption. Demand for Automotive Parts We posit a two sector model with an automobile manufacturing and automobile purchasing sector in order to investigate the impact of US demand for Japanese transplants on the auto parts trade. In this partial equilibrium setup we assume that the manufacturing sector utilizes labor and auto parts to make automobiles for given amounts of capital. Furthermore, we assume that autoworkers are also the consumers that comprise the auto purchasing sector. A modified two good rational expectations model is employed to analyze consumption of transplant automobiles. In the purchasing sector, automobile consumers seek to maximize their utility from automobile purchases subject to budgetary constraints. The model sheds some light on factors that help to determine the demand for Japanese auto parts. The Model In the manufacturing sector we assume that firms are myopic (see Blanchard and Melino (1986) for a more intricate model with forward looking agents) and maximize profits subject to cost constraints. Suppose that automobile manufacturers only use labor Lt and auto parts Ht to manufacture automobiles. Further, assume that capital Kt is fixed in the short run, Wt is wages, Yt is units of automobiles produced and Pt h is the price of automobile parts. Firm's Problem

Let Ct  Ctd  Ctm , be the total amount of non-transplant automobiles purchased by US consumers where Ctd is Big 3 production and Ctm is imports; Ft is the amount of transplant automobiles produced; Ptc an index of automobile prices in US dollars; Pt f the price of a transplant; At the assets of automobile buyers;

 the subjective discount rate which we assume to

be the real interest rate without loss of generality; rt is the prevailing market interest rate. In order to identify the derived demand for automotive parts we modify and extend Clarida's (1992) model. Assume that automobile consumers have preferences over sequences of transplant and nontransplant automobiles, and maximize the present value of their utility stream from automobile consumption for some continuous, strictly concave and differentiable utility function U ( Ct , Ft ) , as follows: Automobile Consumer's Problem

[2]

In this model we assume that constraints are binding, there are no bequests and consumers are uncertain about future returns on assets. We assume that markets clear so that supply equals demand at all times6. This model can be easily extended to incorporate labor supply equations in the spirit of Lucas-Rapping (1969) in order to determine the impact of wages on the production process. However, the connotations of that process are outside the scope of this study. Closed Form Solution Assume a Cobb-Douglass production function7 with productivity shocks zt such that

zt  t   t ,

 t ~ iid ( 0,2 ) and  t is a non-stationary component.

6 This assumption is reasonable assuming that automobile manufacturers engage in Just-In-Time production techniques. 7This parametrization is motivated by Hansen and Wright (1992).

Solution of the automobile consumer's problem leads to the following equations derived from first order conditions (see Appendix):

Here  t is the marginal utility of wealth and

where t rt 1t t 1   is the Fisher interest rate relation, t rt 1 is expected nominal interest rate next period and t  t 1 is expected inflation. From [6] and [7] we get the familiar relation that the marginal rate of substitution between transplants and other automobiles is equal to the ratio of prices. Here we let Ptc be the numeraire in US dollars so that from [7]

Demand Equation The implicit function theorem and the relation for Et [ ln  t 1 ] in [9] suggests a general rational expectations solution as follows:

[11]

From market clearing conditions in [5], Ft  Yt  Ctd . This suggest that transplant production is negatively correlated with Big 3 production. In order to reflect price changes in parts due to exchange rate effects, substitute Pt H Et for Pt H in [11], where E t is yen/dollar exchange rate. Thus, after substitution we get, for some function h,
Et [ Ht 1 ] t Ht 1  h( tAt 1 , At ,Wt , Ft ,t  t 1 , Ht , Pt H Et d ,Ct ) Pt f

[12]

A discretized differential of [12] on the domain of h(.) reduces to the following:

Ht 1  Ht  hA At 1  hW Wt  h t 1  hF Ft  hC d Ctd  hq qt  t
and

 t Ht 1  hA t At 1  hW Wt  h t t 1  hF Ft  hC d Ctd  hq qt  t
where q 

[13]

Pt H E t , h( . ) is the partial derivative of h with respect to the given element of its domain, Pt f

 ( . ) is the discretized incremental change (i.e. difference operator 1-L), and t is an error term.

Thus, changes in transplant demand depends on changes in consumer wealth, earnings, expected inflation, auto parts, expected Big 3 production, and the relative price of imported auto parts. The following vector of trade variables was selected as instruments for the domain of h(.):
Z t  bt at ct ft ptJ mt
T

where bt is seasonally adjusted Big 3 production, at is automobile installment credit which serves as an instrument for consumer wealth and earnings, ct is seasonally adjusted capacity utilization in auto manufacturing industry, f t is the transplant production that induces the derived demand for imported aut parts, ptJ is the yen-dollar exchange rate used as an instrument for relative price and

8

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

mt is the amount of auto parts imports. Inflation variables (e.g. consumer price indexes) were
omitted since they are embedded in the yen/dollar exchange rate. From an econometric stand point the specification in [13] suggests that the "error term" encompasses the steady state/long run values of the variables. So that [13] suggests the implementation of an econometric model which captures long run and shortrun dynamics - such as the ECM used later in this paper. Further, [13] can be expanded to include productivity and business cycle effects through the appropriate parametrization of t and the inclusion of lagged regressors. For instance, if t is nonstationary then a time trend(s) would pick up producitivity increases imbedded in  t from the production function. Luckett (1986) provides a review of other explanatory variables such as patterns of growth in automobile credit and other financial variables that can be included in the time t information set to serve as instrumental variables. Moreover, if we impose structure on the utility function (i.e. Houtakker's addilog utility), we can derive explicit closed form solutions for the demand equations. For empirical purposes we assume that agents in this model have perfect foresight and we employ a simple specification for [13] via an ECM and a parsimonious VAR to provide a dynamic system of equations. III. EMPIRICAL RESULTS III. 1. Data Sample data were obtained from a variety of sources and consists of monthly observations from 1985:1-1992:12, with 1985:1-1988:12 representing the pre harmonized tariff schedule regime or the pre Free Trade in Parts Act (1988) regime. The value of imports were obtained from unpublished International Trade Commission sources. Data on Big 3 production, transplant production and the active stock of Japanese automobiles (after market sales) were obtained from the OSAT-UMTRI Economic Database. All other data were obtained from Citibase Economic Database. The aftermarket sales series is an unweighted spline of yearly data. Big 3 production and transplant production is the total car and truck production for Ford, Chrysler and GM and Honda, Toyota and Nissan automobile assembly plants in the U.S. All data used in the analyses are in

9

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

levels - except the ECM analysis conducted in log levels. All production data in the forecast models were seasonally adjusted by the US Bureau of the Census X-11 procedure developed by Shiskin, et al (1967)8. Measurement Error On January 1, 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce implemented a new tariff code schedule which expanded the number of parts categories used in prior periods. This procedure was designed to make measurement of US trade data comparable and consistent with a more widely used international coding system. Moreover, customs officials were no longer allowed to include transportation and insurance costs in the value of imports. Further, the International Trade Commission defines an automotive part as a discrete product used in the assembly of components or automobiles. Thus, raw materials and other goods used in automobile manufacturing are not included in total parts import but are classified elsewhere. Therefore imports may be overstated when transportation and insurance costs are used, understated due to misclassification and expanded due to inclusion of more parts categories. The net effect of these processes on the data was the imposition of a pre tariff regime in the pre January 1, 1989 period and a post tariff regime thereafter. Further, yen/dollar volatility was relatively high in the 1985:1-1988:12 period relative to the 1989:1-1992:12 period (see Figure 5-6 in Appendix). Therefore some of this volatility may have spilled over in the valuation of trade. When the aforementioned procedures are juxtaposed against other events in the economy (i.e. increase/decrease in automobile demand) we get a nonstationary time series in the pre tariff period and a relatively stationary series in the post tariff period. The econometric approach employed later in this paper circumvent the difficulties presented by these strong regime shifts by implementing an error correction model and a Markovian or state space forecast model. III.2 Spurrious Regressions and Pseudo-Demand Equation
8 Some authors have criticized use of this procedure because of its inflexibility (see Pierce (1978), Hausman and Watson

(1985)). Dagum (1975) proposed the X-11 ARIMA procedure to maintain the integrity of the most recent observations whenever the series is updated. Fortunately, the US Bureau of the Census X-11 approach worked well on the production data so these pitfalls were avoided.

10

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

Since quantity data and a relative price index for imported auto parts were not available a pseudo demand equation is used for estimating the import content of transplant automobiles9:

mt  0  1bt  2at  3ct  4 f t  5 ptJ1  ut

[14]

where bt is units of Big 3 production of cars and trucks, at is the level of automobile installment credit, ct is capacity utilization in auto manufacturing industry, f t is the amount of cars and trucks made by japanese transplants, ptJ is the yen-dollar exchange rate and mt is the dollar value of auto parts imports and ut is an error term. Here we use a "sources and uses" approach to specify the pseudo demand equation in [14]. The yen/dollar exchange rate is an instrument for relative price. Similarly, automobile installment credit is a proxy for the wealth and earnings of consumers. For example, consumers decision to purchase a new automobile is based in part on their evaluation of future wealth and earnings. The results from estimating this model are shown in Table 1. Even though this model is a very plausible one, with variables derived from the theory in Section II, results are spurrious10 so parameter estimates are not stable. For example, the intercept term is negative and the regressors bt , ct and f t are stochastic. Thus, if we hold capacity utilization, transplant production and automobile installment credit constant, then imports will be

9 Under "normal conditions" an inverse demand function would have price as the dependent variable and quantities as

regressors. However, lack of an appropriate price index and the unavailability of quantity data precluded the estimation of a true demand function. See Diewert and Morrison (1988) for alternate specifications.

negative. This is clearly not the case. Thus, if an industry analyst employs this model to contend that the import content of Japanese transplant is on average $4,039 (see coeffficient of transplant production) then that number would be spurrious.

Results in Table 2 provide further evidence of the spurrious nature of the results in Table 1. Here we see that even when price variables (price indexes) are added to the pseudo-demand equation, the R2 value does not change but the coeficient of the yen/dollar exchange rate changes sign, the estimate for import content decreases and the incongruent negative intercept term is still present. A more plausible and robust estimate of import content is shown in Table 3. Here the intercept term changes from negative to positive and the estimate of import part content is $3,345. The macroeconomic variables in Table 1 representing capcity utilization and level of automobile installment credit are proxies for new automobile production activity and new automobile Table 3: Stable Pseudo-Demand Model III for estimating imported parts content: MODEL: USPARTIMP t  0  1 AFTERMKT t  2 BIG3 PROD t  3TRANSPROD t  4YENt  1   t

demand, respectively. However, there is some overlap between these variables and Big 3 and transplant production. In Table 3, these variables are substituted by the stock of active Japanese automobiles (i.e., used Japanese automobiles) in order to provide a more comprehensive picture for the use of imported parts. The results obtained from this procedure are shown in Table 3 and are more consistent with what theory tell us. The coefficients for the yen-dollar exchange rate changes dramatically. One explanation for this is volatility clustering in the yen over the sample period). In Section IV we employ a time varying specification with an interaction term to estimate the impact of policy and tariff code changes in 1989 on the auto parts trade. Figure 3.

In this set up, one can estimate the impact of different exchange rate scenarios on imports by infusing prior beliefs in any or all of the "signals" (i.e., yen/dollar exchange rate) in Table 3. For instance, prior beliefs about the state of the economy at a future period with respect to production or incorporation of "expert" forecasts of the yen/dollar rate are possible scenarios. This is particularly important when exchange rate series are involved since the recalcitrance of these series make them difficult to forecast11. Figure 3 depicts the volatility clustering phenomena in the yen dollar series from 1957:1 to 1992:6. This suggests that declining (increasing) yen dollar rates are followed by decreasing (increasing) rates. Thus, one is forced to depend on an exchange rate scenario in order to forecast imports since forecasting the yen-dollar relationship will be heavily biased by the most recent rates.

III.3 Error Correction Models (ECM) In this section we show how use of an error correction model (ECM) circumvents the measurement error in trade data by focusing on the growth rate of imports. If the measurement error is consistent or systematic (in this case due to ommission), then the rate of growth of imports should be similar in pre and post tariff code regimes. Any increase in growth from one month to the next should be temporal and corrected by a disequilibrium adjustment in subsequent period(s). The short run dynamics of parts imports are depicted in Figure 3 below. Figure 3. Distribution of Volatility and Monthly growth Rate of US Auto Parts Imports from Japan

PRE-HARMONIZED TARIFF PERIOD

POST-HARMONIZED TARIFF PERIOD

The following heuristic example is designed to highlight the properties of the error correction model. Suppose that economic theory suggests the long run relationship: Yt  K0 X t , where K0 is a constant, then ln Yt  ln K0   ln X t . An econometric representation of this relationship can be specified as yt  0  1xt  ut . A typical short run distributed lag parametrization could be written as
yt  0  1xt  2 xt 1   1 yt 1   t .

The steady state solution for the economic model requires that yt  y * and xt  x * for all t. After substitution of these values in the distributed lag model and equating coefficients with the short-run econometric model we obtain relationships between the -coefficients and  ( <1 ) such that
yt  0  1xt  (1   1 )( yt 1  xt 1 )   t

Here  is the long run elasticity and yt and  xt are the short run disequilibrium components. The dynamic adjustment or disequilibrium term is represented by  (1   1 )( yt 1   xt 1 ) . Under this formulation, if y overshoots its equilibrium relationship with x, then the error is corrected in the next period so that y reverts to its equilibrium (see Alogoskoufis and Smith (1991), Davidson, et al (1978), Hendry and Mizon (1978), Hendry, et al (1984), Engle and Granger (1987)). Significance tests of the coefficient of this term reveals whether or not there are significant deviations away from what we would expect from economic theory12. Policy effects such as the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 198913, the Fair Trade in Parts Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act
of 1988 are represented by an indicator variable. For example, the indicator variable is used to capture

pre and post policy "noise". Let Dit be the i-th policy in effect at time t, then we write [14] as14

yt 0   i Dit 1xt (1   1 )( yt 1 xt 1 ) zt 1   t
i 1

N

[15]

where Dit 

1 if i - th policy in effect at time t 0 otherwise

A version of this model was implemented (results are shown later) to test whether the implementation of a new harmonized tariff schedule15 and the Fair Trade in Parts Act of the Omnibus
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 was able to capture any significant short run changes in the

growth of imports and long run business-cycle effects ( zt ). The heuristic model outlined in [15] is robust to instrumental variable (IV) specification tests (i.e. Hausman's Test) for omitted variables. Given the paucity of time series observations available to the study, due to the short time horizon over which the harmonized trade deficit is measured, a restricted ECM may be more useful here. For instance, it may be necessary to restrict the long run

12See Kiviet (1985, 1986) and Engle and Granger (1987) for more details on testing with lagged dependent variables. 13 See Chicago Fed Letter, No 4, December, 1992. Also, the International Trade Commission implemented a harmonized tariff schedule

effective January 1, 1989 which significantly reduced the volatility in import measurements.
14 See Harvey (1990), pp 293 or Davidson, et al (1978) for further motivation of this parametrization scheme. 15 Via this process , the International Trade Commission, effectively imposes a finer grid on trade measurement so that articles which were

heretofore classified under broader categories (i.e. lower digit codes) were scrutinized and placed in the appropriate category via higher digit codes.

15

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

elasticity parameter(s) to values obtained from prior empirical studies. This stems from the fact that even though Engle and Granger (1987) provides a relatively simple two stage procedure for estimating the ECM, Stock (1987) shows that the bias in the estimators can be substantial in small samples. Thus, restricting the long run elasticities reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and improves the accuracy of the estimation procedure. This procedure was not implemented in this study. Estimation and Implementation In this set up the model for short run changes in imports ( mt ) is given by: mt  0  1t  2 Dt  3 ( m  f )t 1  4 bt + 5f t  6bt 1  7 f t 1  8nt 1  9 st 1 + 9 p j t 1  10at 1   t

where t is a time trend that proxies productivity growth, Dt is a dummy variable for the Fair Trade in Parts Act of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, ( m  f )t 1 is the temporal disequilibrium, bt is change in Big3 production, f t change in transplant production, lagged terms are the long run cyclical efffects on imports for Big3 production, transplant production, stock of active Japanese automobiles, yen-dolar relationship and the level of autommobile installment credit, respectively.

17

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

Parameter estimates in Table 4 show that the imposition of the harmonized tariff code has no impact on the measurement of short run changes in imports. Similarly, the short run changes are independent of a time trend and the intercept at a .10 significnce level. Thus, increases in productivity growth does not have a statistically significant impact on short run changes in imports. However, the model indicates that short run changes in US auto parts imports from Japan are quite elastic to long run after market Japanese fleet in the U.S. and temporal disequilibrium adjustments in transplant production. Not surprisingly, the long run cyclical effects of consumer auto installment credit affects the level of auto parts imports. This is a proxy of demand for transplant automobiles. Interestingly, short term changes in imports are inelastic to transplant production in the long run but very elastic to short run production adjustments. III.4 Effeciency Considerations It should be noted that methodological considerations for efficiency are restricted by the necessity for parsimonious data transformation due to the sensitive nature of the study and the relatively small sample size. For instance, the sample data span a period of 8 years thus allowing 96 monthly observations over the pre and post harmonized tariff schedule period.Thus, relationships between variables cannot be altered by transformations which may otherwise provide efficient estimates and distort the interpretation of the model. Thus, the significance of some of the regression estimates may be questionable in the presence of autocorrelation in the error terms. This suggests utilization of robust procedures for heteroskedasticity correction and removal of autocorrelation. Fortunately, White (1980) and White and Domowitz (1982) provide procedures for consistent estimators of the covariance matrix in the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation, respectively16. Recently Keener, Kmenta and Weber (1991) provided a simple proof of these result. Most importantly, they provided an alternative estimator with improved small sample properties. However, these procedures were not implemented in this study.

16 It should be noted that White (1984) also provides a taxonomy of robust procedures applicable to large sample estimtors.

IV. FORECASTS One of the major concerns of US policy makers in the auto industry is the value of imported Japanese parts content of vehicles manufactured in the US (i.e. Japanese transplant and Big 3 production). In order to investigate whether this coefficient will change in the future (given current economic conditions in the industry), we augment the sample with a 24 month forecast, thus extenting the sample over ten years of data. Next we use the stable explanatory model developed in section III to obtain estimates of time varying import content of Japanese transplants. State Space and Markovian Model Univariate Case. A State Space/Markovian approach is used to develop the forecast model because of its efficacy in models with state dependent characteristics and measurement error. Consider the univariate case for imports ( mt ) at time t. Let mt  m* t  vt be the measurement
17 ( v ) are not. equation, where mt is observable but true imports ( m* t t ) and measurement error

Suppose that true imports is AR(2) so that we have the following Markovian process

In this set up, v t and ut are white noise measurement error and idiosyncratic error, respectively. After rearranging we get

where bt is seasonally adjusted Big 3 production, at is automobile installment credit, ct is seasonally adjusted capacity utilization in auto manufacturing industry, f t is transplant production,

ptJ is the yen-dollar exchange rate and mt is the amount of auto parts imports. In this set up, we
assume that each element of the trade vector has measurement error so that parameter estimates are generated similar to the processes outlined earlier for the univariate case. Assume that the

unobservable mean adjusted and difference stationary trade vector follows a multivariate Markovian (i.e. VAR(p)) process given by:

Zt  1Zt 1 ...  pZt  p   t
where

18 Technically, we can restrict the coefficients of the input matrix G so that assumptions about the error terms or

innovations are incorporated in the model. In this case, we proceed as if there was no measurement error in m t. However, if there is, then the coefficients of the input matrix would be estimated accordingly.

Since all the variables in the trade vector have significant lag 1 partial autocorrelation, a VAR(1) specification for the Markovian process is assumed without loss of generality since each element of the vector was differenced accordingly to obtain stationartity. In order to identify the state vector, the multivariate time series Yt is over fitted and the AIC criterion is applied to the smallest cannonical correlate between elements of the predictor space and the sample space. In the next step, only significant lagged variables are added to the state vector. The likelihood function for this process is given by:

A( L ) . So that we write

 ( L)Y  A(1)1 u Yt 1  A(1)1 A t t
So that a necessary condition for the system to be stationary is that A( 1 )1 exists. The invertibility condition for stationarity of the autoregressive element of the VAR is given by

A( L )  ( 1.502L )( 1.317L )( 1.679L )  0

22

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

where  i is the i-th eigenvalue of A. Thus, when L  1 the invertibility condition for the long run matrix is satisfied. In order to determine the innovations for each equation in the system we write the ARMA representation of the model as: A( L ) Yt 1  Adj A( L )  t  ( 1.502L )( 1. 317L )( 1.679L )Yt 1  Adj A( L )  t where Adj[.] is the adjoint matrix generating the innovations in the trade vector. In this set up

A( L ) is a scalar so that each row can be used seperately to make forecasts (see Aoki and
Havanner (1991)) as shown in [19] to [24]. In this six equation system US imports of Japanese auto parts is endogenous. Equation [19] shows that seasonally adjusted capacity utilization, automobile consumer debt burden and the yen/dollar exchange rate are significant indicators of Big 3 production. Equation [21] and [22] indicate that capacity utilization and the yen/dollar exchange rate are significant indicators of the level of transplant production and imports respectively. Further reduction of this sub-system gives the following result:

mt 1  0.015 f t 1  0.481ptJ

[25]

Intuitively, [25] states that tha dollar value of imports in a given month is a function of the amount of transplants produced in that month and the yen/dollar relationship in the prior month. Results from a simple transfer function model show that the direction of causality goes from imports to transplant production (i.e., f t  mt ) with significant lags at 2 and 6 months. The causality result is not surprising if one considers that auto parts are input factors of production. So that parts must be procured (i.e. imported) before production takes place. Results from this procedure are displayed in Table 6. A spectral analysis of imports, transplant production and the yen/dollar analysis (see power spectrum plots in Figure 13-15 in Appendix) indicate that imports and transplant production are synchronous at 2 and 4 month (i.e. approximately quarterly) cycles. However, the yen/dollar exchange rate is synchronous only at 2 month cycles. The AR(1) representation in [20] captures the fact that capacity utilization in the industry is determined by a quarterly meeting of plant managers. Hence, it is fairly exogenous to the model.

23

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

Similarly, the yen/dollar relationship follows an AR(1) representation which is independent of other industry variables. It should be noted that the yen/dollar exchange rate features prominently in all the equations except [20]. So that it is a significant predictor and key policy target that proxies for a relative price in the model. Time series plots of the actual and forecast values for elements of the trade vector are shown in the Appendix. Table 5 indicates that the value of the import content of Japanese transplants will increase from approximately $6Billion in 1992 to $7Billion in 1993 and $8Billion in 1994 even though the value of import content per transplant remains in the $3,400 to $3,800 range. This suggests that Japanese manufacturers will shift more production to the US as the yen continues to appreciate against the dollar. Thus, even though current trade policy may be ineffective in decreasing the import content per transplant, yen appreciation would lead to shifts in production to the US and ultimately more sourcing to US parts suppliers.

Model tends to over forecast transplant production and fits well in-sample for imports. The negative value for import content in 1985 is an artifact of the small sample of 12 observations for 1985 in which imports were relatively flat while transplant production increased (see time series plots in Appendix).

Time Varying Estimates of Import Content One of the goals of current trade policy is to reduce the import content of US made vehicles by substituting domestic content - assuming that US made parts are substitutes for imports. To estimate the impact of these policies we specify the following model:

USPARTIMP t  0  1 AFTERMKT t  2 BIG3 PROD t  3t TRANSPROD t  4YENt 1   t
where the time varying parameter is 3t  

[26]

 3

1985  t < 1989 t  1989

 3  

and  3 is the pre policy and tariff code parts content parameter, 3   is the parameter that includes policy effects,  , that reflect the difference in import content between the two regimes. After substitution we get: USPARTIMP t  0  1 AFTERMKT t  2 BIG3 PRODt  3TRANSPROD t   ( Dt * TRANSPROD)  4YENt 1   t

[27]

where Dt is a dummy variable (0 in pre tariff and policy regime, 1 otherwise). The interaction term in [27] captures the joint effect of tariff code changes, trade policy and transplant production on imports. The sample was augmented by two year (24 months) forecast and divided into 10 intervals (i.e. 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, ..., 120 months for the period 1985:11994:12). Time varying estimates for import content were derived from regressions for each period as shown in Table 7. The negative value in 1985 is an artifact of the small sample Table 7 : Time Varying Imported Japanese Part Content of US transplant

size (i.e. 12 observations) and the fact that transplant production increased at a more rapid rate than imports which were relatively flat in that year (see time series plots in Appendix). The results show that imported Japanese parts content in US transplants declined by approximately $334.00 (i.e between 1988 and 1989) after the Free Trade in Parts Act and the harmonized tariff schedule in 1989. It declined by $848.00 (i.e. between 1988 and 1990) or by $514.00 one year after the schedule was in place. The prognosis for the next few years is that import content will increase from $3,533.00 per transplant in 1992 to $3,920.00 in 1993and $4,059.00 in 1994. A time series plot of the time varying import content is depicted in Figure 4. It shows that the value of imported parts content decreased significantly (see Table 7) in 1991 in response to the FIGURE 4 : Distribution of Imported Japanese Parts Content 1985-1994

tariff and policy initiatives of the authorities but increased thereafter. So that even though a lot of attention has been given to the issue of import content, indications are that current trade policies were effective in the short run but ineffective in inducing a substantial decrease in import content in the long run. This, despite the fact that more production will be shifted to the US. IV. CONCLUSION This paper presented a simple intertemporal rational expectations model which was used to select a vector of variables encompassing elements of international finance and sectoral trade policies in U.S.-Japan Bilateral Auto Parts trade. Econometric specifications were selected to

27

MODELLING AND FORECASTING IMPORTED JAPANESE PARTS CONTENT OF US TRANSPLANTS

capture many of the salient characteristics of modelling and forecasting bilateral US-Japan auto parts trade (within the frameowrk of trade and tariff policies) in the presence of measurement error and switching regimes. Additional approaches that focus on inferential analysis in the presence of measurement error were ommitted due to time and space (see Guilkey and Schmidt (1973) and Doran and Griffiths (1983)). Nonetheless, the techniques implememnted in the paper are robust enough to include inference. This study demonstrated that measurement error and swithching regimes in import data could lead to spurrious regressions if an appropriate subset of trade variables are not properly chosen. We show how to select a stable and parsiminous model which was later modified to provide consistent estimates of the import content of Japanese transplants. A VAR(1)/Markovian model derived from a State Space approach was used to generate forecast of the trade variables used in the stable-parsimonious model. These values were then used to augment the sample in order to provide ex-ante estimates of time varying value of import content over a two year horizon. Our results predict that Japanese manufacturers would shift more production of automobiles to the US in response to yen appreciation. Therefore, even though trade policies were shown to be impotent in affecting a substantial decrease of import content in the long run, the increase in transplant production may lead to an increase in the volume of auto parts sourcing to domestic suppliers. In that scenario, domestic policy fo increased domestic sourcing attains its goals indirectly. Further research on factors determining Japanese import of non-transplant US made auto parts, the import content of Big 3 after market fleet and an analysis of the domestic parts content of US made automobiles, is needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the auto parts trade. The work by Backus, Kehoe and Kehoe (1991, 1992) provides a basis for these analyses.

RESULTS FROM PROCEDURES The relatively high yen-dollar volatility over the pre-harmonization period contributed to the volatility in the value of imports. Thus discarding pre-harmonization data throws away valid information.

The volatility plot for imports suggests that tariff code harmonization reduced the volatility by approximately 50%. However, yen-dollar exchange also plays an important part.
