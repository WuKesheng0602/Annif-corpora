Introduction      Setting  the  Stage  for  Social  Inclusion:  International  Students  in  Canada         International  postsecondary  students  in  Canada  are  a  diverse  population.  Coming   from  152  countries  and  speaking  over  100  languages  (CIC,  2013a),  the  landscape  of   Canada's  universities  are  becoming  as  multicultural  as  its  major  cities.  The  growing   diversity  on  campuses  coast-to-coast  is  a  product  of  Canada's  immigration   framework,  within  which  the  International  Student  Program  has  become  an  integral   piece.  In  January  2014,  the  federal  government  in  collaboration  with  the   Department  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Trade  and  Development  Canada  (DFATD),   announced  that  Canada's  Economic  Action  Plan  and  the  new  Global  Markets  Action   Plan,  would  refocus  Canada's  International  Education  Strategy  to  substantially   increase  the  number  of  international  students;  a  target  set  to  reach  450,000  by  2022   (Govt.  Canada,  2014a).  The  new  quota  represents  another  economically  driven   immigration  scheme  to  bolster  the  Canadian  economy  via  foreign  labour,  offering   skilled  economic  migrants  pathways  to  permanent  residency  in  a  two-step   immigration  process  (see  Section  I)  (Gates-Gasse,  2010).        A  neo-liberal  agenda  (see  below)  comprised  of  dual  processes  of  state  and  

economic  reorganization,  has  influenced  the  Canadian  immigration  system  since  the   1990s  (Arat-Koc,  1999;  Bauder,  2008).  Neo-liberalism  has  significantly  changed  the   characteristics  of  prospective  immigrants  to  Canada  due  to  immigration  programs   that  favour  individuals  who  bring  with  them  language,  financial,  and  labour  market

capital.    The  2002  Immigration  and  Refugee  Protection  Act  (IRPA)  officially  shifted   the  once  humanitarian  and  family  reunification  focused  system,  to  an  economically   oriented  framework,  ensuring  that  future  immigrants  to  Canada  would  be   financially  self-sufficient.  Immigrants  whose  long-term  role  in  the  Canadian   economy  was  uncertain  would  be  admitted  with  temporary  status  (Kelley  &   Trebilcock,  2010).    At  an  elementary  level,  neoliberalism  describes  a  change  in   relationships  between  society  and  the  state.  It  is  a  policy  movement  that  shifts  away   from  post-war  conceptions  of  the  state  as  guarantor  of  societal  well-being,  toward  a   market-oriented  system,  where  individual  self-reliance  replaces  state  provisions   ensuring  human  welfare  (Arat-Koc,  1999).  In  relation  to  migrants,  neo-liberalism   "reflect[s]  increased  expectations  from  immigrants  and  a  lesser  commitment  from   the  Canadian  welfare  state  for  the  rights  and  welfare  of  immigrants"  (Arat-Koc,   1999,  p.  32).  In  the  years  following  the  IRPA,  neo-liberalism  has  continued  to  guide   reforms,  transforming  the  demographics  of  Canada's  potential  immigrants,  the   conditions  under  which  they  would  enter,  and  the  support  available  to  settle  in   Canada.       Alongside  the  neo-liberal  ideology  guiding  Canada's  immigration  system,  a   new  phase  of  globalization  has  emerged.  Information  and  communication   technologies  have  transformed  industrial  societies  into  knowledge  societies,   reorganizing  economies  globally,  and  placing  increased  importance  on  highly  skilled   professions  requiring  advanced  training  or  post-secondary  education  (PSE)  (Guruz,   2011).  In  newly  industrialized  countries  democratization,  privatization  rather  than   central  planning,  research  and  development,  and  decreased  regulation  for  economic   2  

activity  have  set  the  stage  for  a  two  fold  process  resulting  in  almost  150  million   knowledge  seekers  in  the  global  international  education  market  (Guruz,  2011).   Thus,  as  the  economies  of  East  Asia  and  South  America  began  to  quickly   industrialize  and  participate  in  the  global  knowledge  economy,  post-industrial   states,  including  Canada,  internationalized  their  higher  education  systems,   recruiting  large  numbers  of  international  students.  Responding  to  growing   populations  of  international  students  and  new  competitors  in  the  global  knowledge   economy,  neo-liberal,  post-industrialized  countries  began  their  "race  for  talent"   (Shachar,  2006,  p.  110).  Seeking  to  retain  international  students  with  locally   acquired  education  to  drive  national  innovation,  remain  internationally  competitive,   and  supplement  declining  populations,  Canada  and  other  suppliers  of  international   higher  education  reconfigured  immigration  policies  to  retain  educational  sojourners   as  skilled  immigrants.   Despite  immigration  reforms  to  promote  the  mobility  of  international   students  to  Canada,  the  country  holds  a  much  smaller  share  of  the  global  total  of   mobile  students  compared  to  countries  with  similarly  aligned  international   education  strategies.  In  2012  the  United  States,  United  Kingdom,  and  Australia,  and   all  attracted  at  least  100  percent  more  international  students  than  Canada,  ranking   Canada  in  eighth  place  in  terms  of  share  of  the  global  international  student  market   (Simon,  2014).  The  response  to  the  comparative  under-use  of  Canada's  higher   education  system  by  international  students  unfolded  as  an  enhanced  International   Education  Strategy.  A  key  objective  of  the  strategy  is  to  increase  international   student  populations  in  Canada  by  100  percent  in  less  than  a  decade.  According  to   3  

the  Strategy,  Canada's  enlarged  global  share  of  international  students  will  create   new  jobs  for  Canadians  and  bolster  the  national  economy  through  increased   international  student  expenditures  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a).  The  population's   expenditures  on  accommodation,  tuition,  and  transportation  in  the  Canadian   economy  presently  amount  to  approximately  $7.7  billion  annually  (Roslyn  Kunin  &   Associates  Inc.,  2012).  This  figure  is  estimated  to  reach  over  $16  billion  by  2022;   growth  of  these  expenditures  alone  mark  significant  gains  for  the  Canadian   economy  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a).   While  the  substantial  increase  of  international  students  in  Canada  has   definite  benefits  for  the  Canadian  economy,  the  policy  framework  leaves   unaddressed  important  consequences  of  rapidly  growing  international  student   populations.  Have  the  conditions  of  the  International  Education  Strategy,  the   International  Student  Program,  and  the  international  student-specific  pathways  to   permanent  residency  taken  into  consideration  the  current  challenges  of  Canada's   economic  immigrants,  who  like  international  students  are  linguistically  and   culturally  diverse?  Are  postsecondary  institutions  equipped,  in  terms  of  finance,   capacity  and  will,  to  meet  the  needs  of  100  percent  more  international  students?   These  are  significant  questions,  the  answers  to  which  will  ultimately  impact  the   success  of  the  objectives  of  Canada's  policies  and  programs  regarding  international   students.     While  federal  policy  changes  have  increased  the  volume  of  CIC's   International  Student  Program  as  a  strategy  to  supplement  declining  populations   and  to  strengthen  the  economy  through  locally  educated,  skilled  labour,  few   4  

provisions  have  been  made  to  address  the  conditions  of  exclusion  the  policy  has   created  for  international  student  populations.  The  following  sections  seek  to   provide  an  analytical  overview  of  the  policies  and  practices  regarding  international   students  in  Canada,  as  a  means  to  open  the  dialogue  on  a  new  policy-aligned   programming  agenda  for  international  students,  at  the  heart  of  which  are  inclusion   and  equity.  Section  I  presents  the  relevant  policies  and  governmental  strategies   relating  to  international  students  and  offers  a  framework  to  build  an  argument  for   the  social  inclusion  of  international  students  in  Canada.  Section  II,  provides  an   explanation  of  the  methodological  approach  taken  in  the  literature  review,  analysis   and  recommendations  sections  of  this  paper.  Using  a  social  inclusion  perspective,   methodology  establishes  the  criteria  for  assessment  as  well  as  the  context  for   recommendations.  Section  III  will  present  current,  relevant  literature  on   international  students'  needs,  barriers,  and  available  services,  seeking  to   understand  the  most  important  areas  of  support  for  international  students,  and  how   such  needs  are  being  addressed  at  present.  Section  IV  will  analyze  the  policy  and   literature  findings,  supplemented  by  information  obtained  from  university  websites   on  international  student  programming.  An  exploration  of  needs  and  programming   possibilities  will  be  carried  out,  guided  by  federal  policy  objectives  and  the  creation   of  conditions  for  social  inclusion.  Section  V  will  offer  recommendations  to  facilitate   the  social  inclusion  of  international  students  in  both  policy  and  practice.  It  will   identify  the  necessary  components  of  a  pathway  model  for  international  service   provision,  which  is  dependent  upon  a  set  of  recommendations  for  governments,   universities,  and  the  private  sector.     5  

Section  I      The  Political  Terrain:  Policies  and  Programs  Facilitating  the  Rise  of   International  Students  in  Canada  
  

Canada's  International  Education  Strategy        Early  in  2014,  the  Canadian  federal  government,  in  collaboration  with  the   Department  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Trade  and  Development  Canada  (DFATD),   announced  that  international  education  would  become  a  priority  sector  under  the   Global  Markets  Action  Plan  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a).  The  resulting  International   Strategy  describes  four  key  initiatives  (see  below)  to  capitalize  on  the  increasing   global  demand  for  international  education.     First,  the  Strategy  seeks  to  enhance  Canada's  competitive  standing  in   international  education  by  prioritizing  goal  setting  and  benchmarking  national   targets.  Carried  out  by  an  advisory  panel  comprised  of  key  actors  in  post-secondary   institutions  in  Canada,  reporting  to  the  Ministers  of  Finance  and  Trade,  coordinated   efforts  to  attract  more  international  students  in  a  regulated  and  growth-oriented   fashion  take  precedence  under  the  Strategy.  This  further  aligns  international   education  with  national  economic  growth  through  the  creation  of  new  jobs,   increased  international  student  spending,  and  relieved  demographic  and  labour   market  pressures,  thereby  facilitating  economic  growth  nation-wide  (Govt.  Canada,   2014a).  The  Strategy's  second  initiative  targets  developing  and  emerging  markets  as   consumers  of  Canadian  education,  with  plans  to  improve  the  branding  of  national   higher  education  to  resonate  with  target  markets,  specifically:  Brazil,  China,  India,

The  ability  of  international  students  to  gain  employment  during  study  in   Canada  has  also  changed  considerably  since  the  introduction  of  the  IRPA.  Only  with   the  2006  introduction  of  the  Off-Campus  Work  Permit  Program  (OCWPP)  were   international  students  studying  at  designated  institutions  legally  able  to  work  off- campus,  up  to  20  hours  per  week  (CIC,  2010).  Such  employment  related  changes  to   the  International  Student  Program  marked  a  critical  policy  shift,  positioning   international  students  as  economic  immigrants.     Pathways  to  permanency.  By  September  2008  CIC  had  implemented  a  new   pathway  to  permanent  residency,  the  Canadian  Experience  Class  (CEC);  the  criteria   for  which  specifically  targeted  international  graduates  as  applicants.  International   graduates  with  professional,  managerial,  and  skilled  work  experience  in  Canada,   typically  gained  via  the  PGWPP,  and  a  Canadian  postsecondary  education,  became   eligible  to  apply  for  permanent  residency  in  Canada  under  the  new  Canadian   Experience  Class  (CIC,  2010).     The  Provincial  Nominee  Programs  (PNP)  represent  another  change  in  the   policy  landscape  affecting  international  students,  and  at  the  time  of  implementation,   marked  a  shift  in  the  once  solely  federal  jurisdiction  of  immigration  policy,   complimenting  Federal-Provincial/Territorial  Agreements.  Since  the  mid-1990s  the   PNP  has  offered  skilled  immigrants  the  opportunity  to  apply  for  nomination  for   permanent  residency  by  a  specific  province  or  territory  (PT),  based  on  regional   economic  needs,  as  defined  by  PTs  themselves  (CIC,  2013).  Over  the  past  decade,   due  to  the  alignment  of  selection  criteria  with  immigrant  skills  and  regional  labour   needs,  these  programs  have  received  increased  attention  by  federal  and  provincial   11  

governments  as  well  as  from  immigrants.  Applicants  first  request  nomination  by  a   specific  province  or  territory,  and  then  apply  to  CIC  to  become  a  permanent  resident   (CIC,  2013b).   Recent  changes  to  the  International  Student  Program.  As  Table  1   exemplifies,  the  International  Student  Program  has  experienced  significant  changes   since  the  implementation  of  the  IRPA.  The  changes  described  have  facilitated   international  students'  transition  to  the  Canadian  workforce,  and  later  to  permanent   residency.  In  2014,  in  the  spirit  of  continued  liberalization  of  economic   opportunities  for  international  students,  CIC  announced  that  students  holding  a   study  permit  would  no  longer  be  required  to  apply  separately  for  a  work  permit.  As   of  June  2014,  part-time,  off  campus  work  privileges  are  included  in  the  conditions  of   study  permits.  New  rules  to  address  potential  misuse  or  abuse  of  the  International   Student  Program  were  also  implemented  in  the  June  2014  changes  and  include   requirements  for  individuals  holding  study  permits  to  actively  pursue  education   while  in  Canada.  Additionally,  a  more  rigorous  system  of  standards  for  educational   institutions  to  become  legally  designated  to  accept  international  students  holding   study  permits  was  established  (Govt.  Canada,  2014b).     The  totality  of  changes  to  the  International  Student  Program  and  the   associated  criteria  changes  for  permanent  residency  pathways  have  positioned   international  students  as  one  of  the  most  economically  important  immigrant   populations  to  federal  and  provincial  governments.  The  intended  outcomes,  as   expressed  in  Canada's  International  Education  Strategy  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a),  are   to  continue  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  international  students.  Based  on   12  

international  graduates'  education,  language  skills,  and  work  experience  in  Canada,   it  is  expected  the  group  will  smoothly  transition  into  productive  labour  for  the   Canadian  economy.     Canadian  Federalism  and  Post-Secondary  Education        Discussions  of  the  Canadian  policy  climate  in  the  context  of  education  cannot  be   understood  without  addressing  the  structural  nuances  of  federalism  in  Canada.   Bakvis  and  Skogstad's  (2008)  work  provides  a  foundation  for  the  understanding  of   federalism,  in  the  Canadian  context:     The  foremost  principle  of  federalism  is  that  each  order  of   government  is  autonomous  within  its  sphere  of  authority;  its   jurisdictional  powers  may  be  altered  only  in  conformity  with   constitutional  provisions,  never  through  unilateral  action  by   the  other  government.  [...]  The  second  principle  of  federalism   [...]  [is]  to  provide  a  balance  between  unity  and  diversity  (p.   4-5).        The  authors  further  explain  that  performance  related  issues  of  federalism,   for  example  the  capacity  to  produce  results  through  negotiation  or  information   exchange,  are  a  result  of  the  relationship  between  the  central  government  and  the   constituent  units.  That  is,  whether  the  central  government  is  subordinate  to  the   constituents,  or  vice  versa  (Bakvis  &  Skogstad,  2008).  Unlike  most  federations,   Canada  offers  its  provinces  and  territories  little  formal,  structured  representation   at  the  federal  level,  which  ideally  would  take  the  form  of  a  second  chamber  of   Parliament.  Aside  from  the  Senate,  provincial  and  territorial  underrepresentation   at  the  federal  level  has  created  a  certain  level  of  regionalism  or  weak  intrastate   federalism  that  segregates  the  interests  of  Canada's  provinces  from  wider

national  concentrations.  Weak  intrastate  relationships  are  highly  problematic  in   the  context  of  international  education,  details  of  which  will  be  described  below.     Education  in  Canada  is  exclusively  a  provincial  jurisdiction  (Guruz,  2011),   and  consequently  the  provinces  have  direct  control  of  all  education  sectors  and   educational  levels,  developing  legislation,  and  regulating  and  coordinating   primary  through  post-secondary  education  (Shanahan  &  Jones,  2007).  As  noted   weak  intrastate  federalism  has  resulted  in  the  absence  of  a  federal  coordinating   body  for  education  (Guruz,  2011).  In  relation  to  post-secondary  education,  the   constitutional  division  of  powers  and  regionalism  is  problematic,  as  core  federal   policy  arenas  intersect  with  higher  education  (Shanahan  &  Jones,  2007).  These   include  national  security,  external  affairs,  economic  development,  and  Indian   affairs.  While  provincial  governments  provide  operating  support  to  the  post- secondary  institutions  in  their  jurisdictions,  federal-provincial  transfers   represent  important  financial  support  to  institutions  of  higher  education   (Shanahan  &  Jones,  2007),  despite  provincial  autonomy  in  educational   administration  and  governance.  Federal  funding  takes  the  form  of  tax  point   transfers,  cash  transfers,  or  equalization  payments,  representing  an  important,   albeit  decreasing  source  of  funding  directed  toward  post-secondary  institutions   (OECD,  2004).     Since  1997  the  federal  government  has  re-envisioned  post-secondary   institutions  as  core  contributors  to  national  innovation,  and  has  attempted  to   transform  the  parameters  of  funding  at  higher  education  institutions  (OECD,   2004).  Financial  transformations  have  manifested  through  increased  funding  of   14  

research  and  development,  beginning  with  the  1997  Canada  Foundation  for   Innovation  at  $3.15  billion,  and  spanning  through  to  the  2000  creation  of  Canada   Research  Chairs,  at  $900  million  (OECD,  2004).  The  2014  announcement  of  an   enhanced  federally  operated  international  education  strategy  marks  further   progression  toward  a  blended  jurisdictional  model  of  higher  education.     Despite  these  gains,  core  funding  for  post-secondary  institutions  by  the   federal  government  remains  on  the  downturn,  with  federal  support  amounting  to   57  percent  of  overall  funding  of  PSE,  down  from  more  than  90  percent  in  the   1970s  (Canadian  Federation  of  Students,  2013).  Further  problematizing  the   ineffective  federal-provincial  post-secondary  funding  model  is  the  federal   positioning  of  higher  education  as  an  economic  immigration  tool;  a  point  of   criticism  by  PSE  administrators,  who  note  the  shift  as  ethically  problematic   (Gates-Gasse,  2012).  The  continued  reduction  of  federal  funding  for  PSE  has   downloaded  financial  responsibility  of  operating  higher  education  institutions   onto  students  through  user  fees,  resulting  in  disproportionate  increases  in  tuition   (Canadian  Federation  of  Students,  2013).  As  federal  policy  facilitates  the  entry  of   diverse  student  populations  with  unique  service  needs  onto  provincially   governed  post-secondary  campuses,  core  financial  support  for  provinces'  PSE   needs  must  be  augmented  to  meet  the  long-term  federal  vision  of  international   students  as  economic  migrants.  At  present  many  provinces  and  universities  view   the  lack  of  PSE  funding,  and  the  continued  and  rising  flows  of  international   students  into  Canadian  universities  as  an  unfair  deal.  The  role  of  Canadian   federalism  in  the  social  inclusion  of  international  students  on  provincial  and   15  

university  levels  will  be  analyzed  in  later  sections,  and  will  provide  a  platform  for   practical  and  policy  recommendations  involving  key  actors  in  Canadian   international  education.

Section  II      Methodology         A  social  inclusion  lens  guides  the  research  and  analysis  carried  out  in  this  paper.   This  approach  requires  comprehensive  analysis  of  issues  and/or  barriers,  and  thus   draws  on  an  exclusion  perspective.  The  social  inclusion  lens  takes  the  barriers   experienced  by  the  victims  of  exclusion  and  considers  the  policies  and  institutional   processes  that  create  conditions  of  exclusion.  It  then  assesses  institutions,  policies,   and  practices  that  perpetuate  exclusion  and  recommends  solutions  that  include  all   actors  involved,  including  the  victims  themselves.  As  such,  the  social  inclusion  lens   is  applied  throughout  the  following  sections  to  acknowledge  barriers  faced  by   international  students,  assess  current  policies,  actors,  and  support  mechanisms  that   either  perpetuate  exclusion  or  facilitate  inclusion,  and  thus  consider  innovative   responses  to  dismantle  barriers  and  achieve  equitable  outcomes.  To  that  end,  it  is   essential  to  engage  policies,  programs,  and  experiences  as  interrelated  phenomena.   Additionally,  through  the  social  inclusion  lens,  policy  is  seen  as  a  driving  factor   behind  social  exclusion  and  therefore  the  methodology  of  this  analysis  considers   achieving  policy  success  a  criterion  of  social  inclusion,  and  policy  failure  a  criterion   of  social  exclusion.     The  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Canada  (CIC)  website  and  several  CIC   Evaluation  Reports  were  assessed  to  understand  the  International  Student  Program   and  the  affiliated  permanent  residency  pathways,  as  a  means  to  contextualize  recent   policy  changes  and  university  programming  agendas.  Results  were  obtained  using   17  

keyword  searches  (e.g.  "international  student",  "International  Student  Program",   "foreign  student")  on  the  CIC  website;  the  most  useful  data  was  gathered  using  the   2010  CIC  Program  Evaluation  on  the  International  Student  Program.     As  a  basis  for  exploration  into  the  social  inclusion  of  international  students  at   Canadian  universities,  a  literature  review  was  undertaken  to  provide  critical  insight   from  a  scholarly  perspective,  to  identify  gaps  in  research,  and  establish  common   understandings  of  international  students.  To  support  these  findings  several  working   papers  and  informational  reports  were  used.  The  websites  of  four  publically  funded   universities  in  Canada  were  then  reviewed,  gathering  information  regarding  specific   programs  and  services  offered  to  international  students.  Information  obtained  using   keyword  search  criteria,  including  "international  student",  "language",  "academic",   "culture",  "employment"  and  "finances"  were  applied  to  explore  key  domains  of   social  inclusion  present  on  Canadian  campuses.  Due  to  the  scope  of  this  project,  only   four  institutions  were  surveyed.  The  choice  of  institutions  assessed  were  based  on   the  author's  assumption  that  due  to  regionalism  in  Canada,  programming  initiatives   in  different  geographic  areas  of  the  country  would  reflect  the  nuances  of  the  political   climate,  and  highlight  a  patchwork  approach  to  international  student  services  due  to   weak  intrastate  federalism.  The  comprehensive  findings  of  the  university- international  student  service  scan  can  be  found  in  Appendix  A  and  in  short-form  in   Table  2.  The  succeeding  exploratory  analysis  will  use  a  social  inclusion  perspective   to  evaluate  the  quality  and  quantity  of  targeted  programming,  and  further,  will   unpack  federal  policy  to  explore  the  ways  in  which  current  policies  set  the   conditions  for  inclusion  or  exclusion.     18  

Social  Inclusion      The  social  inclusion  perspective  has  immense  value  in  application  to  the  affairs  of   international  students  in  Canada.  As  temporary  migrants,  international  students  are   excluded  from  services  and  rights  granted  to  those  with  formal,  permanent  status,   or  citizenship.  To  this  end,  the  social  inclusion  perspective  puts  forth  the  notion  of   democratic  citizenship,  whereby  members  of  society  possess  rights  based  on  their   membership  to  the  community  rather  than  formal  citizenship  (Saloojee,  2003).  As   Saloojee  (2003)  explains:   Social  inclusion  is  about  social  cohesion  plus,  it  is  about   citizenship  plus,  it  is  about  the  removal  of  barriers  plus,  it  is   anti-essentialist  plus,  it  is  about  rights  and  responsibilities   plus,  it  is  about  accommodation  of  differences  plus,  it  is   about  democracy  plus,  it  is  about  a  new  way  of  thinking   about  the  problems  of  injustice,  inequalities  and  exclusion   (p.  14).        Earlier  work  by  Benick  and  Saloojee  (1996)  applies  inclusivity  to  education   and  suggests  that  an  inclusive  learning  environment  is  "about  respecting  students   and  valuing  them  as  partners"  (p.  2).  This  notion  of  partnership  is  crucial  in   understanding  the  social  inclusion  perspective  and  in  differentiating  it  from   frameworks  of  exclusion.  As  a  guide  for  the  assessment  of  the  policies  and  practices   related  to  the  rise  of  international  students  in  Canada,  social  inclusion  provides  a   platform  to  assess  not  just  policies,  programs,  or  outcomes,  but  widens  the   viewpoint  to  include  individuals  and  communities  who  influence  and  are  influenced   by  the  aforementioned.  This  includes  international  students,  community   organizations,  university  staff  and  faculty,  policy  makers,  the  private  sector,  and   society  as  a  whole.  Questioning  if  and  how  international  students  are  being  treated   19  

as  partners  in  their  ascribed  hybrid  role  as  students  and  potential  economic   contributors  the  social  inclusion  lens  unpacks  the  intentions  of  federal  policy   relating  to  international  students.  Further,  it  suggests  assessment  of  the  quantity   and  quality  of  university-level  support,  and  provides  a  starting  point  for  a  dialogue   that  encourages  the  alignment  of  federal  policy  with  attainable,  equitable  outcomes   through  the  engagement  of  all  invested  actors.        The  relationship  between  social  inequality  and  opportunities  for  success   strongly  influences  social  participation,  deciding  the  extent  to  which  individuals  are   able  to  access  education  and  training,  amongst  other  factors  (Walton,  2000).  As  an   extension  and  response  to  social  exclusion,  the  social  inclusion  perspective  finds   similar  connections.  While  acknowledging  the  importance  of  removing  barriers   excluding  certain  populations  from  equitable  educational  and  essential  supports  for   social  and  economic  success,  the  perspective  also  looks  at  policies  and  practices  of   institutions  not  only  as  culprits  of  exclusion  but  also  as  sites  of  progress,  capable  of   deconstructing  societal  obstacles  and  leveling  the  terrain  toward  inclusion   (Saloojee,  2003).  This  analysis  takes  the  social  inclusion  perspective  to  a  new  level,   looking  within  higher  education  institutions  and  exploring  the  extent  to  which  those   already  accepted  into  the  formal  institutional  structure  are  granted  tools  and   opportunities  for  success  during  and  after  their  education  experiences.  Given  the   current  policy  agenda  in  Canada,  this  exploration  is  an  important  one.              20  

  

Section  III      Literature  Review  Investigating  Policies,  Programs  &  Perceptions      The  Social  Inclusion  Lens        International  students  attending  Canadian  post-secondary  institutions  are   increasingly  diverse.  Almost  twenty  years  ago  Benick  and  Saloojee  (1996)   commented  that:  "learners  attending  Ontario  colleges  and  universities  are,  on   virtually  any  demographic  variable  (race,  gender,  ethnicity,  social  class,  religion,   language,  age,  disability),  more  diverse  than  any  time  in  the  past"  (p.  1).  Today,  this   holds  true  for  all  regions  in  Canada.  Though  the  social  inclusion  lens  has  yet  to  be   applied  to  international  student  populations  in  scholarly  work,  its  principles  are   critical  in  considering  educational  equity  for  international  student  populations.   Saloojee  (2003),  citing  Walker  and  Walker,  explains  that  social  exclusion  "refers  to   the  dynamic  process  of  being  shut  out,  fully  or  partially,  from  any  of  the  social,   economic,  political  or  cultural  systems  which  determine  the  social  integration  of  a   person  in  a  society"  (p.  2).  Given  international  students'  temporary  migration  status,   and  combined  with  the  federal  expectation  that  such  populations  will  easily   integrate  into  the  Canadian  economy,  it  is  important  to  look  at  barriers  as  well  as   opportunities.  The  pairing  of  exclusion  and  inclusion,  through  application  of  the   social  inclusion  perspective,  suggests  not  merely  the  causes  for  a  potential  policy   failure,  but  the  actors,  actions,  and  resources  necessary  to  provide  the  conditions  for   policy  success,  considering  approaches  that  facilitate  equity,  and  strive  for  equality   (Ogbuagu  &  Ogbuagu,  2013).  Inclusion  therefore  means  more  than  consideration  or  

21  

token  change  (Bishop,  2005).  It  represents  an  action-oriented  approach  that   engages  all  stakeholders,  including  international  students,  and  strives  to  combine   policy  with  practice  through  evaluation  and  a  unified  values  framework  that   eliminates  discrimination  and  celebrates  difference  (Saloojee,  2003;  Bishop,  2005).     The  findings  of  this  literature  review  frame  the  following  exploratory   analysis,  in  that  it  applies  a  social  inclusion  lens  to  a  group  whose  long-term   struggles  have  not  yet  been  experienced.  While  international  students  have  become   a  distinct  unit  of  analysis  in  scholarly  literature,  many  authors  acknowledge   international  student  challenges  in  isolation  from  each  other.  Each  issue  described   provides  a  deeper  understanding  of  language,  culture  or  employment  in  the   international  student  experience.  However,  these  issues  do  not  exist  separately   from  one  another:  language  proficiency  issues  impact  confidence,  which  deters   students  from  creating  social  capital  with  Canadian  students;  later  this  will  impact   the  networks  students  have  to  gain  career  employment,  and  in  turn,  influence  their   final  decision  to  stay  in  Canada  to  pursue  permanent  residency  or  to  return  home   with  their  degrees.  Thus,  the  information  gathered  serves  as  a  platform  to  engage   dialogue  on  creating  a  comprehensive  international  student  social  inclusion  agenda   that  fuses  policy  goals  with  university  support  programs.        The  Literature        Literature  analyzing  international  students  has  increased  over  the  past  15  years.  It   is  interdisciplinary  and  seeks  to  understand  the  challenges  and  opportunities  posed   by  increasing  the  numbers  of  international  students  for  governments,   22  

postsecondary  institutions,  practitioners,  and  for  the  students  themselves.  Between   2006  and  2008  repositioning  of  international  students  in  the  Canadian  immigration   system  sparked  a  new  wave  of  literature  focusing  on  the  migration  intentions  of   international  students  and  the  implications  of  international  students  as  economic   migrants  and  permanent  residents  (Gates-Gasse,  2010;  Roach,  2011;  Gates-Gasse,   2012;  Kelly,  2012).  This  second  wave  of  literature  published  after  2006   contextualizes  more  senior  studies  of  international  students'  language  proficiencies,   acculturation,  economic  well-being,  and  pursuits  of  permanent  status,  and   highlights  the  protracted  struggles  of  international  students  left  unresolved  by   policy  makers  and  practitioners.  Alongside  the  literature  on  international  student   barriers  have  emerged  important  works  on  globalization,  neo-liberalism,  and  their   impacts  on  higher  education  (Shachar,  2006;  Zheng,  2010;  Guruz,  2011).  Assessing   international  student  needs  for  successful  integration  and  social  inclusion,  the   following  literature  review  will  provide  perspective  on  current  programming  at   post-secondary  institutions  targeted  at  international  populations,  as  well  as  situate   the  Canadian  approach  to  international  higher  education  in  a  global  context.     Major  gaps  were  noted  in  the  literature  on  the  analysis  of  types  of  programs   available  to  international  students.  A  survey  of  4  major,  publicly  funded  Canadian   post-secondary  institution  websites  found  that  a  wider  range  of  programs  exist  than   those  described  in  the  literature,  and  can  be  found  in  Section  III,  Table  2.  The   exception  to  this  somewhat  narrow  view  of  international  student  needs  and   programming  available  was  Gates-Gasse's  (2012)  review,  which  sought  to  assess   international  student  support  comprehensively  and  in  light  of  federal  policy   23  

intentions.  The  content  of  university  websites  was  not  included  in  this  literature   review  due  to  the  search  parameters  of  peer-reviewed  journals,  theses  and   dissertations,  published  scholarly  books  and  working  papers  from  established   organizations  in  the  international  education  and  immigration  fields.  The  rationale   for  this  exclusion  was  to  evaluate  the  academic  perspectives  that  are  established  or   emerging  in  the  disciplines  related  to  immigration  and  settlement,  and  to  guide   further  scholarly  work  in  this  capacity.     International  Students  and  Canadian  Higher  Education        The  global  context.  The  number  of  international  students  globally  is   increasing,  and  is  expected  to  reach  7.2  million  by  2025  (OECD,  2004).  Within  this   growing  global  sector  of  international  education,  Canada  has  made  incremental  yet   cumulatively  significant  policy  changes  in  attempts  to  become  an  influential  actor  in   the  sector.  Canada  is  making  progress  but  it  still  lags  behind  competitor  countries   such  as  the  United  Kingdom,  United  States,  and  Australia  (Guruz,  2011).  In  recent   years  explicit  policy  changes  by  Canada's  federal  governments  have  repositioned   international  students  to  occupy  economic  roles,  thereby  transforming  the  national   approach  to  cross-border  higher  education  to  "the  skilled  migration  approach"   (OECD,  2004,  p.  12).  Today,  international  students  not  only  play  a  central  role  in   universities  on  a  temporary  basis  -  valued  for  cultural,  political,  and  academic   reasons,  representing  the  former  "mutual  understanding  approach"  (OECD,  2004,  p.   13)  but  are  also  conceptualized  as  a  new  source  of  permanent,  skilled  human  capital   to  contribute  to  the  national  economy  (OECD,  2004;  Arthur  &  Flynn,  2011).  While

Canada  has  been,  in  some  capacity,  demographically  reliant  on  immigration  for   much  of  its  history,  only  recently  has  the  country  deliberately  pursued  the   recruitment  and  retention  of  international  students  from  an  immigration   perspective  (Guruz,  2011).     Over  the  past  two  decades,  socioeconomic  developments  have  created   optimal  conditions  for  a  global  agenda  of  higher  education.  Guruz  (2011)  sees  these   conditions  as  consisting  of  demand  increases,  demographic  shifts,  and  the  rise  of   non-traditional  source  countries  of  immigrants;  the  impacts  of  globalization  on   technology  and  markets;  and,  increased  international  competition.  Neo-liberalism,   applied  here  as  models  of  "policy  and  social  regulation  that  emphasize[s]  the  ideals   of  enterprise,  skills,  autonomy,  and  flexibility"  (Walsh,  2008,  p.  796),  has  played  an   important  role  in  and  has  reinforced  these  shifts.     The  role  of  neo-liberalism.  As  the  federal  government's  conceptualization   of  international  students  has  evolved  and  neo-liberal  ideology  has  permeated   Canadian  federal  policy  creation,  dramatic  changes  have  taken  place  in  relation  to   international  students'  status  and  privileges  while  in  Canada;  all  of  which  promote   interaction  with  the  labour  market  and  attribute  an  assumed  level  of  autonomy  to   such  individuals  (Guruz,  2011;  Gates  Gasse,  2012).  As  the  state's  role  transformed   from  provider  of  resources  to  manager  of  the  economy,  the  responsibility  for   ensuring  societal  well-being  was  transferred  onto  individuals  (Arat-Koc,  1999).   While  federal  policy  regimes  have  been  reorganized  to  favour  economic  self- sufficiency,  few  tangible  opportunities  have  been  provided  to  encourage  or  facilitate   such  behaviours.  Growing  performance  expectations,  especially  of  immigrants,  and   25  

drastically  reduced  social  supports  have  positioned  the  Canadian  state  as  distinctly   neo-liberal  (Arat-Koc,  1999).   Policy  Changes  Impacting  International  Students          Early  changes.  As  outlined  in  Section  I,  Table  1,  many  changes  have  occurred   since  the  mid-1990s  when  Provincial  Nominee  Programs  (PNP)  were  created  as  a   means  to  entice  international  graduates  to  gain  employment  and  settle  in  areas   other  than  Montreal,  Toronto,  and  Vancouver;  regions  which  historically  and   presently  attract  the  majority  of  immigrants  (Alboim,  2011).  Due  to  the  time   international  students  spend  at  postsecondary  institutions  as  temporary  migrants,  it   was  assumed  by  governments  that  the  networks  created  during  this  time  would   facilitate  labour  market  integration  on  a  permanent  basis.    This  resulted  in  a  two- step  immigration  system,  culminating  in  the  2008  addition  of  a  second  pathway  to   permanent  status  for  international  students,  the  Canadian  Experience  Class  (CEC)   (Gates-Gasse,  2010).        Employment.  Similar  changes  have  taken  place  in  respect  to  work  

entitlements  for  international  students  during  their  study  period.  In  the  years   leading  up  to  the  introduction  of  the  CEC,  CIC  developed  the  Post-Graduation  Work   Permit  Program  as  well  as  the  Off-Campus  Work  Permit  Program  to  allow   international  graduates  to  transition  easily  into  the  Canadian  economy  (Fama,   2011).  While  these  changes  have  received  generally  positive  responses,  criticism   centers  on  the  unequal  investment  to  benefit  ratios  between  international  students   and  Canadian  governments.  The  argument  is  based  on  the  economic  and  societal

contributions  of  international  students  and  the  lack  of  policy  changes  regarding   their  ability  to  access  government  funded  settlement  services  (Alboim.  2011;  Fama,   2011;  Lowe,  2011;  Gates-Gasse,  2012).   Targeting  international  students  as  immigrants.  To  date,  the  policy   changes  that  have  occurred  have  been  driven  by  increased  regulation  of  the   Canadian  immigration  system,  often  creating  confusing  and  seemingly  unfair   conditions  for  international  students  to  transition  into  the  labour  market,  and   potentially,  to  permanency  (see  Section  I,  Table  1).  In  the  spirit  of  international   education's  "race  for  talent"  (Shachar,  2006,  p.  105),  the  PNP  and  CEC  are  designed   to  focus  on  actual  employability  rather  than  prospective  employability  (Baglay,   2012).  Structurally,  PNPs  have  created  uncertainty  for  users  of  the  Canadian   immigration  system,  as  each  province  sets  its  own  selection  criteria  and  entry   streams,  resulting  in  a  multitude  of  pathways  and  programs  for  two-step   immigration,  and  thereby  creating  an  unequal  system  for  international  students   based  on  the  province  in  which  they  study.       To  date,  several  provinces  have  created  PNP  international  student  streams,   which  often  have  more  flexible  selection  criteria  than  the  CEC  (Baglay,  2012).   Conversely,  the  CEC  has  sparked  controversy  amongst  international  students  and   policy  commentators,  following  the  November  2013  announcement  that  as  of  May   2014  a  cap  of  8000  was  to  be  placed  upon  new  CEC  applications,  as  well  as  a  sub-cap   of  200  on  each  National  Occupation  Classification  (NOC)  B  applications  (GOVision,   2014).  Based  on  the  Canadian  government's  expression  of  need  for  skilled  human   capital  and  the  development  of  programs  to  permanently  attract  international   27  

students,  the  removal  of  6  eligible  occupations  from  the  CEC  is  problematic   (GOVision,  2014).     Changes  to  the  CEC.  While  it  is  too  early  to  fully  understand  the  impacts  of   these  changes  on  the  International  Education  Strategy's  goals  and  outcomes,  the   removal  of  several  administrative  and  food  service  occupations  from  the  CEC,   popular  entryways  to  Canada's  competitive  labour  market,  may  work  against  the   Strategy's  intentions.  With  the  closure  of  several  entry  level  NOCs,  many   international  students  already  in  Canada  who  have  not  yet  applied  to  the  CEC,  may   choose  to  return  to  their  home  countries  or  continue  their  migration  journey  in  a   third  country,  due  to  the  inaccessibility  to  entry  level  jobs  in  the  Canadian  labour   market  (GOVision,  2014).     Further,  the  changes  mark  a  lack  of  transparency  in  Canada's  brand  of   international  education,  Imagine  Education  au/in  Canada,  which  highlights  the   country's  straightforward  study-work-permanence  transition  (CBIE,  2013).  This   points  to  the  mismatch  between  neo-liberal  market  logic  and  the  conditions  under   which  individuals  will  choose  to  permanently  migrate  away  from  their  country  of   origin  (Sweetman  &  Warman,  2010).  While  Sweetman  and  Warman  (2010)  wrote  at   a  time  prior  to  the  CEC  changes,  their  comment  still  resonates:  "no  CEC-stream   immigrants  have  been  in  the  Canadian  labour  market  long  enough  to  enable  an   evaluation"  (p.  61).  Thus,  it  may  be  noted  that  there  is  an  element  of   shortsightedness  in  the  CEC  reforms.     International  students  as  ideal  immigrants.  The  CEC  caps  lead  to  an   important  theme  within  the  literature:  international  students  as  the  "ideal"   28  

immigrant.  This  ideal  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  time  international   students  spend  in  Canada  prior  to  permanent  immigration  prepares  them  culturally,   linguistically,  and  socially  for  Canadian  life.  Often  this  group  is  referred  to  as   "designer  immigrants"  (Gates-Gasse,  2012,  p.  272),  a  term  that  pairs  their   acculturation  with  the  assumption  that  their  Canadian  credentials  will  allow  them  to   integrate  easily  into  the  labour  market  (Peykov,  2004;  Gates-Gasse,  2010;  Gates- Gasse,  2012).  The  construction  of  an  ideal  or  preferred  immigrant  is  distinctly  neo- liberal,  in  that  the  ideality  is  self-sufficiency.  Self-sufficiency  has  been  an  important   piece  of  the  immigration  discourse  throughout  Canada's  colonial  history  and  it   continues  to  influence  policy  creation,  and  ultimately,  immigrant  selection  (Kelley  &   Trebilcock,  2010).  The  rising  costs  of  international  education  in  Canada  ultimately   reduces  participation  to  those  individuals  who  are  not  only  academically  capable  of   success  in  Canada,  but  bring  with  them  financial  capital  to  supplement  the  economy   and  ensure  economic  independence  (Zheng,  2010).     Settlement  Services  vs.  Student  Services      The  criticism  regarding  the  exclusion  of  international  students  from  accessing   settlement  services  created  for  immigrant  integration  is  less  about  language   programs  and  housing  services,  and  more  about  labour  market  readiness  programs   (Lowe,  2011;  Kelly,  2012).  Arguing  that  immigrant  groups  who  do  not  have  access   to  settlement  services  experience  difficulty  integrating  in  the  labour  market,  Lowe   (2011)  highlights  the  necessity  to  expand  the  federal  settlement  service  funding   model  to  encourage  international  students  to  stay  in  Canada  post-graduation  and  

29  

likewise,  to  fulfill  federal  policy.  This  echoes  Alboim's  (2011)  caution  that  if  Canada   continues  its  quest  to  retain  international  students  as  permanent  residents,  a  clear   settlement  service  plan  must  be  developed.  As  Anisef,  Sweet  and  Adamuti-Trache   (2010)  note,  if  the  federal  government  continues  to  relax  entry  conditions  for   linguistically  and  culturally  diverse  immigrants,  Canada  has  a  responsibility  to   provide  improved  settlement  services.      The  exclusion  of  international  students  from  accessing  federally  funded  

immigrant  settlement  services  is  especially  salient  due  to  the  propensity  of  this  form   of  funding  in  immigrant  settlement  service  networks,  with  federal  funds  accounting   for  80  percent  of  all  settlement  funding  in  Ontario  (Lowe,  2011).  Because  of  this   service  gap  universities  have  taken  on  the  role  of  immigrant  recruiters  and   settlement  service  providers,  as  well  as  educators  (Lowe,  2011;  Wade  &  Belkhodja,   2011;  Gates-Gasse,  2012).  Immigrant  settlement  service  providers  have  expressed   interest  in  partnering  with  post-secondary  institutions  to  deliver  international   student  support,  however  CIC  funding  regulations  have  prevented  such   partnerships  (Chira,  2009).  Additionally,  previous  devolution  of  services  for   permanent  immigrants  from  the  public  sector  to  the  settlement  sector  has   overburdened  the  industry  and  has  financially  prohibited  settlement  service   providers  from  widening  their  scope  of  cliental  without  federal  support  (Evans  &   Shields,  2000;  Siemiatycki  &  Triadfilopoulos,  2010).  This  creates  ethical  issues  for   postsecondary  institutions,  who  as  educators  accept  international  students  to  their   campuses  on  a  temporary  basis,  to  receive  a  Canadian  education.  However,  with  the   repositioning  of  international  student  populations  as  potential  contributors  in  the   30  

Canadian  economy,  there  has  been  a  push  to  include  labour  market  programming  in   the  international  student  service  agenda  (Gates-Gasse,  2012).        These  conflicting  agendas  of  governments  and  universities  have  resulted  in  a  

fragmented  approach  to  servicing  international  student  needs,  an  outcome  that  if       continued  would  undermine  the  quality  of  education  this  population  receives.    Post- secondary  institutions  have  been  required  to  develop  creative  and  cost-effective   approaches  to  serve  international  students.  Moving  forward,  there  is  an  urgent  need   for  common  standards  and  clear  definition  of  expectations  and  responsibilities  of   governments  and  universities  (Alboim,  2011).  As  it  stands,  both  governments  and   universities  feel  the  other  is  positioned  to  gain  the  most  from  the  presence  of   international  students,  leaving  the  discussion  at  a  standstill  (Gates-Gasse,  2012).      International  Student  Demographics  and  Diversity      Diversification  and  equality.  Canada's  emergence  as  an  actor  in   international  education  was  closely  followed  by  a  transformation  in  international   student  demographics  on  Canadian  campuses,  foreshadowing  the  2014   International  Education  Strategy's  focus  on  developing  and  emerging  markets.   Between  2000  and  2004  Chinese  international  students  attending  Canadian  post- secondary  institutions  increased  by  390  percent,  thereby  becoming  the  most   represented  country  in  this  population  group  (Guruz,  2011).  Similarly,  the  number   of  international  students  from  India  rose  exponentially  within  this  period;  in  2000   only  860  Indian  students  were  enrolled  in  Canadian  universities  ­  by  2011  Indian  

31  

international  students  surpassed  the  number  of  Korean,  Hong  Kong  Chinese,   Japanese  and  British  students  at  Canadian  universities  (Guruz,  2011).  Meanwhile,   students  from  Asia  have  steadily  risen  to  account  for  the  largest  share  of   international  students;  Canada's  top  three  source  countries  for  international   students  are  China,  India  and  Korea,  which  together  account  for  49  percent  of  all   international  students  in  Canada  (CBIE,  2012).  Conversely,  students  from  Africa   have  steadily  declined  since  1992  dropping  from  17%  of  total  international  students   in  Canada,  to  12%  in  2008  (CIC,  2013a).  These  trends  illustrate  how  Canada's   growing  presence  in  the  global  knowledge  economy  has  led  to  demographic   diversification  at  universities  Canada-wide.  However,  such  transformations  have   not  occurred  with  educational  equity  as  a  premier  consideration,  and  as  a  result   have  excluded  academically  competitive  students  from  postsecondary  study  in   Canada  (Zheng,  2010).     Just  as  neoliberal  globalization  failed  to  make  free-trade  real  and  equalize   global  wealth  through  technology  and  flexibility,  international  higher  education  has   created  a  greater  divergence  between  the  have's  and  have  not's,  often  establishing   hierarchies  of  nation-states.  Those  countries  that  rapidly  industrialized  and   produced  a  middle  class  capable  of  participating  in  education  abroad  are  thus   positioned  at  the  top  of  such  a  hierarchy  (Zheng,  2010).  The  rapid  industrialization- middle  class  phenomenon  is  represented  by  countries  such  as  China,  India,  and   Korea,  not  surprisingly  overrepresented  in  international  student  populations  at   Canadian  PSEs.  Likewise,  those  nation  states  that  have  not  been  able  to  `catch  up'   industrially  are  in  turn  underrepresented  in  international  student  populations  in   32

constraints  acting  as  barriers  to  accessing  the  Canadian  postsecondary  system,   substantial  diversity  amongst  international  student  populations  exists.  This   diversity  is  a  matter  not  well  understood  by  university  student  administrators.   Keynon  et  al  (2012)  study  at  the  University  of  British  Columbia  found  that   international  student  populations  are  not  homogenous,  despite  the  umbrella  term   `international  student'.  While  all  students,  domestic  or  international,  experience   processes  of  acculturation  and  integration  upon  beginning  postsecondary  studies,   these  matters  are  distinct  and  require  targeted  support.  Clearly  illustrating  this   diversity,  Keynon  et  al  (2012)  present  the  contrast  of  acculturation  barriers   between  American  and  Indian  international  students.  Their  commentary  notes  the   need  to  customize  outreach  and  programming  agendas  to  recognize  group-specific   challenges,  often  misunderstood  by  the  administrative  amalgamation  of   international  student  bodies.     Because  Canadian  post-secondary  institutions  do  not  collect  data  on  the  race,   ethnicity,  or  religion  of  students  there  is  a  dearth  of  knowledge  on  how  the  diversity   of  students  interacts  with  success  achieved.  Therefore,  Canadian  universities  and   colleges  have  relied  on  student  activist  movements  to  instigate  program   development  that  supports  diverse  backgrounds.  Instances  of  this  type  of  program- origin  are  exemplified  well  in  the  Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual  Transgender  Queer  (LGBTQ)   movement  at  the  University  of  Toronto  or  the  Black  student  movement  at  Dalhousie   33  

University,  both  of  which  pushed  university  administration  to  include  the  unique   service  and  pedagogical  needs  of  their  respective  populations  into  the  policies  and   practices  on  campus  (McGrath,  2010).  Student-led  rights  campaigns,  most  powerful   during  the  1960s  and  1970s,  have  set  the  stage  for  diversity  movements  on   university  campuses  today;  however,  success  of  this  type  of  program  initiation  relies   on  the  security  felt  by  students  to  openly  display  their  difference.  This  is   problematic  when  factors  such  as  culture  and  sexual  orientation,  or  health,  or   success  intersect;  for  many  international  students  cultural  perceptions  of  such   matters  differ  greatly  from  Canada  (McGrath,  2010;  Mirwaldt,  2010).  McGrath   (2010)  calls  for  "a  shift  from  student  organization-based  activism  to  institutional- based  advocacy  "  (p.  160),  with  the  onus  on  the  university  community  as  a  whole  to   ensure  diversity  and  inclusion  practices  are  in  place.     International  Student  Support:     Language,  Academic,  and  Cultural  Barriers      Universities  have  sought  to  develop  specialized  programming  to  respond  to  the   barriers  preventing  full  and  equitable  inclusion  of  international  students,  in   academic,  language  and  cultural  domains.  This  service  responsibility  rests  almost   entirely  on  educational  institutions  due  to  international  students'  temporary  status,   and  their  ineligibility  to  access  traditional  immigrant  settlement  services  that  work   to  alleviate  the  hardships  of  settling  in  a  new  country  (Roach,  2011).  As  Albiom   (2011)  notes,  this  is  problematic  because  of  the  lack  of  legislated  standards  for   educational  institutions  to  provide  international  student  services,  resulting  in   differences  in  the  quality  support  offered  by  universities,  and  in  turn,  the  quality  of   34  

education  received.     Several  authors  have  identified  approaches  to  international  student   programs,  and  analyzed  their  outcomes,  either  comprehensively  (Snow-Andrade,   2006;  Kamara  &  Gambold,  2011;  Gates-Gasse,  2012)  or  in  terms  of  the  needs   programs  seek  to  address  (Arthur  &  Achenbach,  2002;  Cheng  et  al,  2004;  Popadiuk   &  Arthur,  2004;  Guo  &  Chase,  2011;  Liu,  2011;  Ranta  &  Meckleborg,  2012).  These   scholarly  assessments  have  found  that  despite  the  prevalence  of  international   student  specific  programming  at  many  universities,  significant  barriers  have  yet  to   be  dismantled.  These  include  English  language  proficiency  (Liu,  2011;  Gates-Gasse,   2012;  Ranta  &  Meckleborg,  2013),  cultural  adjustment  (Myles  &  Cheng,  2003;  Snow- Andrade,  2006),  and  academic  acculturation  (Cheng  &  Fox,  2008;  Guo  &  Chase,   2011).     Language.   Proficiency.  English  proficiency  test  scores  have  become  an  important  focus   for  admissions  committees  in  many  Western  universities,  a  reaction  to  claims  that   NNES  international  students  are  reducing  the  quality  and  value  of  higher  education   (Benzie,  2010).  In  fact,  such  claims  played  a  part  in  the  reconfiguration  of  the   Australian  International  Student  Program  (Hawthorne,  2011).  Higher  English   proficiency  levels  have  been  found  to  have  positive  effects  on  international  students   perceptions  of  security  and  well-being  (Sawir  et  al,  2012),  their  ability  to  form   bonds  with  students  other  than  co-nationals  or  fellow  international  students   (Hendrickson  et  al,  2011),  and  their  academic  success  (Daller  &  Phelan,  2013).

Interestingly,  while  most  NNES  international  students  struggle  with  language  skills,   their  GPAs  are  often  comparable  to  domestic,  native  speakers  (Berman  &  Cheng,   2001),  pointing  to  the  impacts  proficiency  has  beyond  the  classroom.     Naturalistic  language  acquisition.  Learning  the  national  language  in  a   student's  country  of  study  emerges  in  the  literature  as  a  pull  factor  for  many   international  students'  migration  journey  (Liu,  2011;  Ranta  &  Meckleborg,  2103).   Ranta  and  Meckleborg  (2013)  based  a  longitudinal  study  of  Chinese  international   students  exposure  to  English  and  change  in  proficiency  levels.  The  study  was  based   on  the  belief  held  by  many  researchers  and  educators,  as  well  as  international   students  themselves,  that  everyday  exposure  to  language  and  contact  with  native   speakers  leads  to  proficiency.  The  authors  claim  this  to  be  untrue.  Alternatively,   they  found  that  post-secondary  NNES  international  students  continued  reliance  on   co-ethnic  social  networks,  first  language  media  and  entertainment,  and  faculty   relationships  with  co-ethnics,  often  results  in  little  progression  in  English   proficiency  levels  (Ranta  &  Meckelborg,  2013).  In  a  similar  vein,  Liu  (2011)  writing   as  a  former  international  student  notes  that  upon  arrival  in  Canada,  from  her  native   China,  she  felt  her  English  proficiency  levels  were  not  adequate  for  full  participation   in  Canadian  academic  or  social  life.  She  highlights  the  variance  between  English   Proficiency  scores  required  to  gain  admission,  and  actual  proficiency  required  for   inclusion.     English  for  academic  purposes.  Degree  credit,  academic  language  courses   are  suggested  as  a  practical  option  to  address  the  busy  schedules  and  the  language   barriers  faced  by  international  students.  Cheng  et  al  (2004)  find  targeted  academic   36  

language  support  to  be  a  worthwhile  solution  and  suggest  programs  that  focus  on   presentation  strategies,  lessons  on  colloquialisms,  and  note-taking  practice  in   English;  all  transferable  skills  to  course  work,  integration,  and  employment.  While   the  authors  make  important  points  about  the  necessity  of  language  learning  tailored   to  NNES  reliance  on  translation  for  academic  work,  practicality  is  not  integrated  into   their  recommendations.  How  post-secondary  institutions  would  implement   mandatory  language  courses  after  students  have  been  admitted,  based  partially  on   proficiency  scores,  would  likely  present  feasibility  issues  and  thus,  such  an   implementation  may  be  viewed  as  discriminatory  and  neglectful  of  individual   capabilities.     Culture.      Intercultural  communication.  Creating  meaningful  cultural  exchanges  on  

university  campuses  has  been  experienced  as  a  challenging  aspect  of  increasing   student  diversity  (McGrath,  2010).  Guo  and  Chase  (2011)  highlight  the  successes  of   the  University  of  British  Columbia's  Centre  for  Intercultural  Communications,   created  to  provide  a  site  for  cross-cultural  learning  and  sharing  for  all  members  of   the  university  community.  The  outcomes  of  the  Centre  have  pointed  to  the  value  of   investing  in  a  common  multicultural  space,  allowing  the  university  to  fully  maximize   the  diverse  teaching  and  research  experiences  of  its  student  body.  Further,  it  is  the   site  of  cultural  education  for  newcomer  and  international  students  on  Canadian   pedagogies,  and  academic  and  social  language,  and  provides  advising  for  staff  and   faculty  on  challenges  and  successful  strategies  for  teaching  and  collaborating  with

international  student  populations  (Guo  &  Chase,  2011).  UBC's  approach  highlights   an  important  finding  that  echoes  earlier  work  of  Guo  and  Jamal  (2007):  the   intercultural  education  model  is  as  much  about  improving  the  mainstream   understanding  of  diversity  as  it  is  about  developing  culturally  aware  and  well- adjusted  international  students.  Furthermore,  promotion  of  intercultural  spaces,  as   opposed  to  international  student-specific  spaces,  supports  the  notions  of  an   evolving,  diverse  collective  identity,  essential  to  multiculturalism  and  harmonious   cultural  plurality  (Dib,  2006).     Culture  and  academic  life.  Cultural  barriers  to  academic  integration  can   overshadow  individual  capacity  to  succeed.  International  students  have  expressed   frustration  with  the  lack  of  global  content  in  course  curricula,  professors'   misinterpretation  of  language  problems,  difficulty  understanding  the  Western   professor-student  dynamic,  and  the  relatively  small  number  of  institutions  which   provide  support  specifically  for  international  students'  academic  acculturation   (Myles  &  Cheng,  2003;  Guo  &  Chase,  2011).  Supporting  this  is  the  AUCC's  (2007)   finding,  that  while  most  universities  offer  non-academic  student  support  services,   less  than  half  provide  targeted  programming  to  facilitate  academic  success  for   international  students.  Culture  and  academic  success  can  also  converge  with   different  perspectives  and  different  cultural  expectations  of  education.  Moores  and   Popadiuk  (2011)  recount  an  interview  with  a  Chinese  international  student,  who   explained  that  Western  education  focuses  less  on  students  becoming  "very  useful   people"  (p.  297)  and  more  on  individual  fulfillment  of  the  person.  This  finding   points  to  the  importance  of  a  two-way  cultural  adaptation,  including  the  educational   38  

expectations  of  international  students  in  support  programming.     Peer  mentoring.  Partnering  students  for  peer  support  is  a  valued  component   of  many  student  life  programs  at  Canadian  universities.  Pairing  domestic  students   or  more  senior,  experienced  international  students  with  newly  arrived  international   students  is  an  option  for  promoting  inclusion  and  cultural  exchange  (Leask  &   Carroll,  2011),  and  provides  the  opportunity  for  international  students  to  use   formal,  institutionally  organized  programs  to  create  informal  peer  networks  (Dunn   &  Oliver,  2011).  Likewise,  the  AUCC  (2011)  has  noted  the  success  of  peer  mentor   programs  in  assisting  in  the  transition  into  university  for  Aboriginal  students.  The   AUCC  findings  suggest  the  overarching  benefits  of  peer-oriented  support.   Mendelsohn  (2002)  found  that  the  pairing  of  NNES  students  and  native  English   speakers  in  Lecture  Buddy  programs  offset  challenges  of  studying  in  English,   contributed  to  academic  skill  development,  and  provided  international  students   with  opportunities  to  connect  with  their  domestic  counterparts,  who  were  able  to   act  as  informants  on  Canadian  academic  life.      International  Student  Support:     Finances,  Employment  and  the  Labour  Market      Finance.  Perhaps  one  of  the  greatest  barriers  faced  by  international  students   is  the  social  construction  of  the  group  as  `designer  immigrants'  (Lowe,  2011;  Gates- Gasse,  2012).  This  notion  refers  not  just  to  the  assumption  that  international   students  are  ideal  economic  immigrants,  in  that  they  enter  the  labour  market  with   skills,  networks  and  language  skills  that  ensure  success  (Lowe,  2011;  Gates-Gasse,   39  

2012),  but  also  to  the  perceived  economic  wealth  of  the  population  as  a  whole.  Both   scholarly  literature  (Cheng  &  Fox,  2008;  Zheng,  2010)  and  applied  reports  (CBIE,   2009)  point  to  the  different  lived  experiences  of  international  students  in  Canada.     The  Canadian  Bureau  for  International  Education  (2009)  has  found  that   there  are  significant  financial  demands  faced  by  international  students  in  Canada,   with  almost  half  of  international  university  students  expressing  financial  stress.   Scholarly  sources  find  similar  economic  strains  noting  that  the  economic  statuses  of   international  students  must  be  understood  as  diverse,  with  growing  numbers  of   students  from  middle  class  families  migrating  for  international  education  ­  a  finding   that  contradicts  the  notion  that  all  international  students  come  from  wealthy   families  (Waters,  2006;  Zheng,  2010).  Students  surveyed  explained  the  need  to   rapidly  complete  their  program  of  study  to  reduce  living  costs  or  working  long   hours  to  make  ends  meet  (Myles  &  Cheng,  2008).  Building  on  experiences  of   economic  barriers,  the  CBIE  (2009)  study  participants'  most  common   recommendation  for  government  and  postsecondary  institutions  was  to  reduce   international  student  tuition  fees  and  provide  the  group  with  increased   opportunities  for  scholarships  and  bursaries.  Myles  and  Cheng  (2008)  and  Simon   (2014)  argue  that  international  students  are  not  being  afforded  equal  opportunity   to  gain  a  high-quality,  well-supported  education.  The  effects  of  a  costly  yet   unsatisfactory  post-secondary  education  gained  at  Canadian  institutes  directly  and   negatively  impact  the  role  international  graduates  are  able  to  assume  in  the   Canadian  economy  after  graduation  (Myles  &  Cheng,  2008;  Simon,  2014).     The  explicitly  expressed  financial  stresses  of  international  students   40  

demonstrate  that  finances  are  a  barrier  to  the  populations'  success  in  Canada,   supporting  the  CBIE  (2009)  survey  results  and  the  AUCC  (2011)  findings  that   decreased  student  funding  may  negatively  impact  enrolment.  Further,  the  CBIE   (2009)  found  that  the  relatively  few  scholarships  and  bursaries  available  for   international  students  at  Canadian  institutions  is  a  substantial  push  factor  away   from  study  in  Canada.  However,  a  push  away  from  Canada  merely  means  a  loss  of   the  global  share  of  international  higher  education  for  the  country.  International   students  view  the  US  as  a  more  attractive  study  choice  as  it  offers  more  scholarships   despite  higher  tuition  fees  (CBIE,  2009).  Generally,  the  literature  focuses  on  factors   other  than  economic  support,  perhaps  indicating  the  commonly  held  belief  that   international  students  are  in  fact  designer  immigrants.     Employment.  Two  forms  of  employment  are  currently  available  to   international  students  in  Canada:  on-campus  and  off-campus.  Off-campus   employment  was  cited  in  the  literature  as  an  important  means  through  which   international  students  could  earn  money  and  improve  their  English  (Liu,  2011),   create  bridging  social  capital  (Knutson,  2011),  and  feel  a  sense  of  belonging  to  the   wider  community  (Knutson,  2011).  Nevertheless,  language  and  culture  are  critical   factors  in  the  job  search  process.  The  ability  to  connect  language  learning,  academic   study,  and  career  planning  is  perhaps  the  most  important  advantage  of  international   student  employment,  aside  from  increased  income.     Research  and  teaching  assistantships.  Specific  to  international  graduate   students  is  the  option  of  gaining  on-campus  employment  as  a  research  or  teaching   assistant.  University  funded  employment  is  an  important  part  of  international   41

must  also  be  considered  and  included  in  programming  and  service  agendas.     Social  capital.  Bridging  and  bonding  social  capital  for  traditional  immigrant   populations  are  commonly  discussed  as  foundational  building  blocks  of  integration   and  inclusion  (Aizlewood  &  Pendakur,  2005;  Putnam,  2006).  It  is  argued  that   successful  integration  requires  both  forms  of  social  capital.  First,  bonding  social   capital,  which  describes  access  to  social  resources  within  immigrants'  ethno-cultural   or  linguistic  communities.  Second,  successful  immigrant  integration  requires   opportunities  to  access  and  interact  with  the  resources  and  members  of  other   communities,  referred  to  as  bridging  social  capital.  Thus,  well-developed  social   capital  has  benefits  of  dual  support,  originating  from  within  their  communities  and   through  access  to  other  communities.  Bridging  social  capital  has  benefits  which   include  opportunities  to  gain  better-suited  employment,  further  language  learning   to  high  proficiency  levels,  and  creating  diverse  social  networks  (Aizlewood  &   Pendakur,  2005;  Pendakur  &  Mata,  2012).  While  the  social  capital  theory  has  not   been  directly  applied  to  the  integration  of  international  students  and  graduates  in   Canada,  the  application  of  the  concept  to  the  population  has  similar  benefits  to   social  capital  building  for  traditional  immigrant  populations.          Labour  market  preparation.  Despite  the  growing  numbers  of  international  

students  in  Canada  (Guruz,  2011)  and  federal  policy  intentions  to  integrate  the   population  into  the  labour  market  (Lowe,  2011),  few  authors  were  able  to  discuss   the  merits  of  post-graduation  employment  readiness  programs  or  strategies  at   universities,  geared  specifically  toward  international  students.  This  is  likely  due  to   the  lack  of  such  initiatives,  representing  possible  strategic  resistance  by  university   43  

programmers  in  light  of  the  ethical  dilemma  of  retaining  international  student  after   graduation.  Authors  who  included  Memorial  University  of  Newfoundland  (MUN)  in   their  analyses  (Knutson,  2011;  Gates-Gasse,  2012)  discussed  the  value  of  the   Professional  Skills  Development  Program  for  International  Students,  offered   collaboratively  by  the  province  and  the  university  as  a  means  to  increase  employer   awareness  of  this  potential  labour  pool  and  facilitate  career  employment  for   international  students.  This  progressive  programming  agenda  by  MUN  is  a  product   of  the  province's  2008  Multiculturalism  Policy,  and  the  creation  of  grants  and   subsidies  for  newcomer  support  initiatives  (Knutson,  2011).     Student  perceptions  of  the  Canadian  labour  market.  The  CBIE  (2007)   survey  on  international  students  and  employment  in  Canada  has  found  that  the   population  perceives  there  are  significant  barriers  to  labour  market  entry.  The   barriers  include  discrimination  in  hiring  practices  and  inconsistent  policies  that   make  staying  in  Canada  difficult.  Of  the  sample  surveyed,  two-thirds  noted  they   would  return  to  their  home  country  or  seek  employment  in  another  country,  post- graduation.  The  other  third  who  planned  on  remaining  in  Canada  would  likely   encounter  difficulties  in  transitioning  from  study  to  work,  connecting  with  the   misconceptions  of  employers  surveyed  who  believed  they  were  unable  to  hire   international  graduates  (CBIE,  2007).     Scholarly  Recommendations  for  Support        As  different  groups  require  different  supports  for  success  (Keynon  et  al,  2012),  a   more  structured,  adaptable  university-wide  system  has  been  suggested  to  create  an

effective  and  inclusive  learning  community  (Kamara  &  Gambold,  2011).  A  three- phase  program  has  been  recommended  to  streamline  the  international  student   experience  through  a  set  of  centralized  services  and  supports.  The  program  consists   of  a  period  of  transition  and  sociocultural  adaptation;  a  period  of  promotion  of  tools   for  international  students  to  self-resolve  anticipated  or  real  integration  challenges;   and,  a  partnership  oriented  phase,  seeking  to  continually  progress  linguistic  and   cultural  inclusivity  in  classrooms  by  encouraging  staff,  faculty  and  students  to   collaborate  (Kamara  &  Gambold,  2011).     Similarly,  though  more  broadly,  Snow  Andrade  (2006)  finds  that  providing   international  student  support  is  about  building  networks  of  services  that  can  be   individualized  depending  upon  student  need.  International  students  face  barriers   and  achieve  success  in  areas  that  cannot  be  measured  by  quantitative   measurements,  such  as  GPA  and  retention,  and  thus  universities  must  engage  with   international  student  populations  to  gain  first  hand  knowledge  of  their  needs  and   wants.  Snow  Andrade  (2006)  suggests  that  current  support  centres  and  faculty   receive  training  on  best  practices  for  integrating  international  students  into   academic  and  social  life  on  campus,  to  ensure  collaborative  success  for  universities   and  students  (Snow-Andrade,  2006).  Liu  (2011)  also  makes  suggestions  for  a  new   agenda  of  international  student  support,  wherein  all  campus  services  and   organizations  can  collaborate,  each  playing  important  roles  in  the  acculturation  of   international  students  on  Canadian  campuses.                 45  

         Section  IV      Analysis      The  Landscape:  Past  and  Present        Assessing  the  social  inclusion  of  international  students  in  Canada  involves  first,  a   discussion  of  the  political  landscape  guiding  the  formation  and  implementation  of   policy  influencing  higher  education  and  two-step  immigration.  "Embedded   liberalism"  (Banting,  2006,  p.  417),  characterized  by  a  simultaneous  liberalization  of   the  economy  and  expansion  of  social  security,  has  been  ideologically  overshadowed,   and  finally  replaced  by  a  paradigm  insistent  upon  providing  opportunities  to  gain   knowledge  and  self-sufficiency  rather  than  tangible  support  to  ensure  societal  well- being  (Banting,  2006).  While  this  approach  represents  a  well-orchestrated  social   investment  strategy,  it  has  de  facto  removed  the  state  from  responsibility  to  provide   and  protect,  and  has  shifted  this  responsibility  to  the  individual.  This  new  policy   agenda  has  transformed  federal,  and  to  some  extent  provincial,  ideology  and  thus   has  influenced  immigration  policy,  reconstructing  the  national  migration  strategy   through  a  series  of  incremental  changes,  resulting  in  a  massive  system  overhaul   (Banting,  2006;  Bauder,  2008).  The  outcome  has  resulted  in  a  far-reaching  neo- liberal  immigration  framework,  which  like  social  policy  strategies,  seeks  to   economize  well-being  and  prioritize  self-sufficiency  over  equity.  While  immigration   in  Canada  has  long  been  a  "structural  necessity"  (Bauder,  2008,  p.  132),  the   46  

economic  utility  of  potential  immigrants  has  been  highlighted  by  a  neo-liberal  policy   agenda.  It  represents  a  "race  for  talent"  (Shachar,  2006,  p.  105)  as  well  as  the   introduction  of  temporary  immigrants  as  a  solution  to  the  burdensome  federal   responsibility  of  past  immigrant  cohorts  who  struggled  to  succeed  economically.     In  1973  Canada's  Temporary  Foreign  Worker  Program  (TFWP)  was  created   to  address  labour  shortages  in  highly  skilled  professions,  and  remained  a  "last- resort"  solution  for  employers  fill  job  vacancies  through  foreign-born  labour,  until   the  1990s  (Nakache  &  Kinoshita,  2010).  Alongside  the  entrenchment  of  a  neo-liberal   policy  agenda,  the  TFWP  program  expanded  to  include  live-in  caregivers,   agricultural  workers,  and  by  2002  included  lower  skill  level  jobs  (Foster,  2012).  In   the  spirit  of  liberalization,  flexibility,  and  self-sufficiency,  international  students,  a   once  strictly  temporary  population,  were  re-envisioned  as  a  source  of  potential   labour.  Representing  a  pool  of  acculturated,  economically  capable,  and  linguistically   advanced  would-be  migrants,  the  federal  government  began  to  reconfigure  policies   pertaining  to  international  students  shortly  after  the  2002  introduction  of  the   Immigration  and  Refugee  Protection  Act  (IRPA),  Canada's  reformed  immigration   framework.  Significant  modifications  included  the  conditions  under  which   international  students  could  transfer  between  institutions,  apply  in  country  and   online  for  study  permits  and  renewals,  and  legally  obtain  employment  in  Canada   both  during  and  following  postsecondary  graduation.  Such  changes  represented   steps  toward  the  2008  creation  of  the  Canadian  Experience  Class  (CEC),  a  pathway   to  permanent  residency  tailored  to  fit  the  demographics  and  experiences  of   international  students  (CIC,  2010).     47  

Under  the  CEC,  international  students  and  economic  migrants  use  their   skilled  work  experience  in  Canada,  Canadian  acquired  postsecondary  education  and   advanced  English  language  skills  to  apply  for  permanent  residency  (CIC,  2014).   Representing  a  two-step  immigration  process,  international  students  initially  enter   Canada  as  temporary  immigrants,  gaining  the  necessary  skills  and  education  for   economic  migration  independently.  Next,  they  obtain  status  as  economic   immigrants  and  via  liberalized  permanent  residency  programs  including  the  CEC  or   PNP,  and  apply  to  stay  in  Canada  permanently.  These  pathways  to  permanency   highlight  the  federal  reconceptualization  of  international  students'  presence  in   Canada  and  represent  the  culmination  of  past  employment  liberalizations  for  the   population.  Further,  the  pathways  solidify  the  process  of  two-step  migration  as  a   permanent  feature  of  the  federal  policy  landscape  (Gates-Gasse,  2010).     Due  to  the  prominence  of  self-sufficiency  under  the  neo-liberal  agenda,   international  students,  as  temporary  migrants,  are  ineligible  to  access  most   immigrant  settlement  services  (Chira,  2009).  Serving  as  quasi-sponsors,  universities   hold  absolute  responsibility  to  prepare  international  students  for  not  only  academic   success,  but  also  for  success  in  Canada,  long-term.  This  has  created  several  key   challenges  and  responsibilities  for  universities.  In  terms  of  challenges,  universities   are  faced  with  financial  burdens  of  the  day-to-day  operations  of  Canada's   International  Education  Strategy.  With  already  limited  resources  for  student   services,  funds  are  required  to  be  divided  further  to  accommodate  changing  campus   demographies  and  diversifying  student  needs  (Kamara  &  Gambold,  2011).  Student   services  are  funded  through  decreasing  federal  transfers  by  their  respective   48  

provincial  governments  (Bakvis  &  Skogstad,  2008;  Guruz,  2011)  and  increasingly   through  student  tuition  and  fees.  Because  of  the  user-fee  model  universities  have   been  pushed  to  adopt,  governments  are  criticized  for  exploiting  the  education   system  for  wider  economic  gains,  and  with  university  administration  citing  the   dynamic  of  international  students  as  future  economic  migrants  as  ethically   problematic  (Gates-Gasse,  2012).       While  this  reframing  of  international  students  has  only  recently  gained   momentum  in  Canada,  it  is  a  product  of  globalization  that  has  prioritized   internationalized  higher  education  and  promoted  domestic  responses  capitalizing   on  the  international  mobility  of  students  (OECD,  2004;  Guruz,  2011).  The  global   agenda  for  higher  education  has  resulted  in  a  large-scale  push  of  knowledge  seeking   students  from  newly  industrialized  countries  without  developed  post-secondary   sectors,  toward  post-industrialized  societies  with  well-developed  higher  education   systems  (Guruz,  2011).  Though  the  intention  of  initial  migration  may  be  circular,  the   Western  race  for  talent  has  resulted  in  the  retention  of  mobile  students  to  benefit   declining  populations  and  strengthen  the  economies  of  the  host  state  (Guruz,  2011).   As  with  most  effects  of  globalization,  international  student  flows  are  a  multi- dimensional  phenomenon.  International  students  have  agency,  intentions,  and   aspirations.  Many  international  students  in  Canada  report  that  international   education  is  a  means  to  achieving  a  better  life  in  a  new  country  (Arthur  &  Flynn,   2011);  conversely  large  portions  of  such  students  have  intentions  to  migrate  to  a   third  country  or  back  home  after  graduation,  due  to  perceptions  of  better   employment  prospects  elsewhere  (CBIE,  2007).  With  multiple  actors  and  strikingly   49  

different  perceptions  of  success,  international  student  policies  must  be  analyzed  and   discussed  in  light  of  each  stakeholder,  and  within  a  wide-reaching  framework  of   social  inclusion.     International  Students  and  Inclusion        To  create  successful  policy  outcomes,  the  conditions  for  individual  success  must   first  be  set.  For  many  international  students  at  Canadian  universities,  there  are   barriers  preventing  full  contribution  to  Canadian  society.  The  barriers  that   reproduce  and  reinforce  social  exclusion  are  dependent  upon  the  structural  design   of  policies  and  institutions,  as  well  the  characteristics  of  individuals  granted  entry   into  institutions,  via  polices  and  institutional  governance  practices.  At  universities  in   Canada,  variation  of  international  student  needs,  for  example,  ethnicity,  language,   race  or  religion,  is  not  a  primary  programming  consideration.  The  result  is  often   homogenizing  programs  that  further  complicate  integration  rather  than  serving  to   support.  This  is  perpetuated  by  the  continued  use  of  the  umbrella  term   `international  students'  when  developing  programming,  thus  overlooking  the  group- specific  international  students  needs,  challenges  and  potential  contributions.   Keynon  et  al  (2012)  found  that  the  normalized  understanding  of  "international   students"  as  non-native  English  speakers  from  newly  industrialized  countries,   excluded  Anglo  international  student  populations  from  engaging  with  international   student  services,  due  to  the  lack  of  relevance  to  their  group-specific  settlement   challenges.         50  

Program  Assessment        An  environmental  scan  was  carried  out  to  investigate  the  services  offered  by   universities  across  Canada,  and  how  they  seek  to  include  international  students  in   programming  agendas  and  recognize  the  group's  unique  challenges.  The  scan   assessed  four  universities  representing  the  four  major  regions  of  Canada:  the   University  of  British  Columbia  (UBC)  in  Vancouver,  BC,  representing  Western   Canada;  the  University  of  Calgary,  in  Alberta,  representing  the  Prairies;  Ryerson   University  in  Toronto,  representing  central  Canada;  and  Memorial  University  of   Newfoundland  (MUN)  in  St.  John's,  representing  the  Atlantic  provinces.  The   universities  were  chosen  to  highlight  regional  variations  in  international  student   programming  approaches  nation-wide,  and  to  reinforce  the  impacts  of  federalism   on  international  higher  education.  Using  the  search  function  on  university  websites,   searches  were  carried  out  by  applying  keywords  representing  core  support  domains   identified  in  the  scholarly  literature:  language,  culture,  academics,  finance,   employment  and  career.  The  keywords  were  paired  with  the  specifying  or  filtering   term  "international  student".  The  findings,  detailed  in  Table  2,  confirmed  Alboim's   (2011)  observation  that  international  student  services  have  been  downloaded  onto   educational  institutions  and  in  the  process  have  become  uneven  in  quality  and   consistency.  Depending  on  the  institution  an  international  student  chooses  to   attend,  the  quality  of  education  and  support  varies  substantially,  thus  resulting  in   vast  differences  in  educational  and  labour  market  outcomes.           51

Language  support.  Common  to  all  institutions  were  well-developed  English  

language  support  programs.  Ranging  from  traditional  English  support  centres,  to   conversation  partners  and  English  for  Academic  Purposes  courses,  each  university   appears  to  have  identified  two  important  factors.  First,  that  the  composition  of   international  student  populations  is  changing:  no  longer  are  international  students   migrating  from  a  small  network  of  Anglophone  countries,  as  in  past  years  when  the   United  States  and  United  Kingdom  were  leading  source  countries  (Statistics  Canada,   2011).  On  campuses  across  Canada,  growing  populations  of  Indian,  Chinese,  Korean,   and  many  other  nationalities  can  be  found,  with  each  group  representing  a  distinct   ethno-cultural  identity,  along  with  very  different  English  language  abilities.  Second,   the  acknowledgement  of  linguistic  diversity  and  subsequent  programming  marks  an   important  understanding  in  the  expectations  of  international  students.  For  many   years  an  assumption  was  held  in  second  language  acquisition  circles  that  because   non-native  English  speaking  international  students  were  studying  and  often   working  in  an  English  language  dominant  country,  they  would  naturally  acquire   advanced  English  proficiencies  (Ranta  &  Meckleborg,  2013).  Moving  away  from  this   perception  of  language  acquisition  is  a  significant  step  for  universities,  having   created  extensive  networks  of  language  support  for  their  NNES  populations,  with   increasingly  limited  financial  resources.     Cultural  support.  While  language  components  of  the  inclusion  of   international  students  were  identified,  the  scan  found  less  than  satisfactory   programming  efforts  to  address  student's  acculturation  processes.  Excluding   student-run  cultural  associations,  other  efforts  to  promote  two-way  cultural   53  

awareness  were  limited.  Only  UBC,  with  its  Centre  for  Intercultural   Communications,  and  MUNs  Culture-to-Community  program  identified  culture  as  a   potential  barrier  to  inclusion  for  international  student  populations.  UBC's  Centre  for   Intercultural  Communications  was  developed  in  response  to  increasing  diversity  on   the  university's  campus  and  the  need  for  an  inclusive  site  of  two-way  cultural   exchange  (Guo  &  Chase,  2011).   Differing  from  International  Student  Offices,  which  all  the  universities  in  the   scan  had  established,  the  Centre  for  Intercultural  Communications  aims  to  maximize   the  different  life  and  learning  experiences  of  faulty,  staff,  and  students  by  engaging   all  stakeholders  in  meaningful  cross-cultural  exchanges.  Intending  to  foster  a   collective  university  identity  that  promotes  cultural  plurality,  the  Centre  focuses  not   only  on  supporting  international  students  in  their  adjustment  to  Canadian  culture,   but  includes  training  for  staff  and  faulty  on  strategies  for  internationalizing   curricula  and  collaborating  with  international  students  (Guo  &  Chase,  2011).  The   Culture-to-Community  program  at  MUN  has  similar,  but  less  ambitious  intentions,   aiming  promote  cross-cultural  understanding.  Due  to  the  program's  target  Canadian   audience,  K-12  students,  meaningful  results  will  take  some  time  to  have  effect.        Based  on  the  information  available  on  university  websites,  it  is  difficult  to  

know  whether  course  curricula  are  being  adapted  to  engage  international  students,   as  all  university  websites  claim  to  have  internationally  focused  or  multicultural   campuses.  The  literature  exposes  a  less  promising  side  in  respect  to  integrating   culture  into  subject  course  work,  with  international  students  often  explaining  they   feel  responsible  for  adding  the  cultural  dimension  courses  through  class   54  

discussions,  either  as  a  student  or  a  teaching  assistant  (Myles  &  Cheng,  2003;  Guo  &   Chase,  2011).  Such  student  perspectives  clash  with  the  International  Education   Strategy,  which  aims  to  internationalize  curricula  both  at  home  and  abroad  (Govt.   Canada,  2014a).     The  relative  lack  of  cultural  inclusivity  and  intercultural  awareness   programming  at  universities  located  geographically  between  British  Columbia  and   Newfoundland  and  Labrador  is  alarming.  While  Ryerson  University  and  the   University  of  Calgary  each  have  agendas  to  promote  cross-cultural  interaction  via   peer  mentoring  programs,  the  onus  is  placed  on  the  student  body  to  prioritize   intercultural  sharing  and  engage  with  programs  and  international  students.  Just  as   government  has  downloaded  immigrant  settlement  service  responsibility  onto   provinces,  municipalities  and  institutions  (Evans  &  Shields,  2000),  universities  have   downloaded  cultural  integration,  and  to  some  extent  social  inclusion  practices,  onto   its  students.        Academic  support.  Language  and  culture  intersect  in  the  academic  lives  of  

international  students.  English  for  Academic  Purposes  (EAP),  thus,  could  be  used  as   a  tool  for  inclusion  for  NNES  international  students,  who  are  increasingly   representative  of  international  student  bodies.  Acknowledging  the  differing   pedagogies,  language  skills,  and  social  behaviours  required  for  success  in  higher   education  in  Canada,  EAP  could  provide  international  students  with  applied   language  skills  that  integrate  and  advance  them  into  academic  life.  Simultaneously,   programming  must  acknowledge  the  different  and  valuable  knowledge  that   international  students  bring  with  them  to  Canada.  With  well-established  English   55  

language  support  systems  in  place  at  all  four  universities  in  the  international   student-programming  scan,  each  included  some  form  of  EAP  agenda  (see  Table  2;   see  Appendix).  However,  the  quality  of  these  attempts  to  fuse  language,  culture  and   academics  may  not  be  enough  to  engage  international  students  to  participate.     According  to  the  Canadian  Bureau  for  International  Education's  2009  survey,   only  12  percent  of  international  students  at  Canadian  universities  utilize  learning   support  services.  The  underuse  of  EAP  and  academic  supports  available  to   international  students  points  to  the  necessity  of  programs  to  work  in  tandem  with   outreach,  and  to  include  students  in  the  development  of  EAP  programs.  Due  to  the   promotional  nature  of  university  websites  the  actual  effectiveness  of  EAP  and   general  language  support  programs  at  the  universities  scanned  is  unknown.   However,  based  on  the  literature  it  appears  that  students  are  not  engaged  by  the   content  or  delivery  style  of  such  services.  Liu  (2011)  explains  that  the  importance  of   the  role  of  targeted  language  support  should  focus  not  solely  on  ameliorating   proficiency  struggles,  but  also  on  cultural  adaptation  and  the  creation  of  social   capital.     As  per  the  findings  of  several  studies  (Berman  &  Cheng,  2001;  Cheng  et  al,   2004;  Cheng  &  Fox,  2008),  there  is  a  distinct  need  for  well-designed  EAP,  as  NNES   international  students  continue  to  cite  presentation  skills,  class  participation,  and   critical  writing  as  the  most  significant  barriers  in  their  academic  acculturation.  For   many  international  students  these  academic  skills  were  not  included  in  their  prior   learning  environments.  From  the  social  inclusion  perspective,  EAP  works  to   dismantle  the  barriers  of  culturally  infused  academic  language,  and  seeks  to   56  

overcome  the  challenge  though  collaborative  program  design.  However,  if  carried   out  via  an  inclusionary  programming  agenda,  EAP  initiatives  must  be  voluntary   despite  a  suggestion  in  the  literature  that  all  NNES  international  students  be   automatically  enrolled  (Cheng  et  al,  2004).        Labour  market  readiness.  Federal  policy  aligning  international  students  

with  the  labour  market  makes  salient  the  aforementioned  strategies  for  language,   culture  and  academic  support.  Without  language  skills  and  cultural  competency  of   Canadian  life,  international  students  are  at  a  great  disadvantage  in  an  already   competitive  job  market.  However,  as  experienced  by  Canada's  economic   immigrants,  there  is  much  to  be  learned  about  labour  market  entry,  beyond   qualifications.  For  international  students,  the  process  of  job  preparedness  begins   during  the  study  period,  and  thus  requires  special  programming  by  universities.   However,  only  MUN  with  its  job  readiness  program,  and  Ryerson's  career   mentorship  included  employment  oriented  programming  (see  Table  2).  At  the   federal  level,  post-graduation  employment  barriers  have  been  partially   acknowledged  through  policies  facilitating  early  contact  with  the  Canadian  labour   market,  specifically  the  Off-Campus  Work  Permit  Program  (OCWPP),  and  more   recently  through  the  inclusion  of  part-time  work  privileges  in  study  permits  (Govt.   Canada,  2014b).  It  is  important,  in  this  context,  to  question  if  liberalizing   employment  rights,  through  federal  programs  such  as  the  OCWPP  and  the  PGWPP,   promotes  equitable  participation  in  the  labour  market  for  international  students.   That  is,  does  entry  to  the  labour  market  mean  equality  in  employment  outcomes?   The  social  inclusion  perspective  suggests  that  it  is  not  only  federal  programs  that   57  

cause  international  students  to  struggle  in  their  labour  market  entry,  but  rather  the   conditions  the  programs  create  through  undefined  objectives.  Thus,  dismantling  the   barriers  of  access  to  employment  through  labour  liberalizing  policies  should  be   complimented  with  programs  that  work  in  unison  with  subject  study  to  inform   international  students  on  the  Canadian  job  market  and  provide  opportunities  to   build  bridging  social  capital.     Career  development.  Alongside  labour  market  readiness  programs   universities  should  create  intuitive  career  programming  agendas.  Given  budgetary   constraints,  a  result  of  governmental  austerity,  and  paired  with  a  political  climate  of   neo-liberalism,  this  type  of  programming  should  be  promoted  rather  than  impeded.   Both  social  inclusion  and  policy  success  require  international  students  to  have   access  to  the  tools  necessary  to  thrive  in  society.  For  international  students,  matters   of  language  and  culture  can  manifest  as  barriers  to  societal  success.  International   student-specific  career  development  support  was  limited  to  International  Student   Advising  present  at  all  universities  (see  Table  2).  Descriptions  of  the  type  of  support   offered  by  these  advisors  often  noted  career  services  (see  Appendix),  however,  it   may  be  assumed  that  international  students  would  be  referred  to  co-operative   education  programs  or  general  career  services.     Because  there  are  no  visible  support  systems  that  allow  international   students  to  receive  training  to  overcome  barriers,  their  education  in  Canada  does   not  translate  into  the  success  that  policy  has  envisioned.  In  an  increasingly   globalized  world,  international  students  possess  vital  skills  that  paired  with  higher   education,  position  them  as  extremely  desirable  employees.  However,  there  is  a   58  

mismatch  between  the  ability  of  international  students  to  positively  contribute   economically  and  the  prevalence  of  labour  market  successes  experienced.  Facing   barriers  such  as  absence  of  knowledge  about  the  job  market,  underdeveloped  local   networks,  and  general  lack  of  job  readiness,  international  students  are  entering  the   labour  market  at  job  levels  much  lower  than  their  qualifications.  This  echoes   experiences  of  economic  immigrants  to  Canada,  who  despite  advanced   qualifications  and  significant  job  experience,  are  underemployed  (Bucklaschuk  &   Wilkinson,  2011).     Finances.  At  the  heart  of  employment,  is  finance.  For  international  students,   financial  concerns  are  a  complex  issue.  While  it  is  true  that  international  students   are  self-funded,  many  report  experiencing  financial  hardships  that  compromise  the   benefits  of  an  international  education.  According  to  the  Canadian  Bureau  for   International  Education's  2009  survey  of  postsecondary  international  students,  40   percent  of  international  students  attending  universities  expressed  that  their   financial  situation  was  a  significant  problem.  The  university  scan  found  limited   funding  opportunities  for  international  students,  with  the  majority  of  such  financial   supports  targeted  at  international  graduate  or  doctorate  students  (see  Table  2).  The   need  for  financial  incentives  to  study  in  Canada  will  continue  to  grow  along  with  the   demand  for  international  education  and  the  propensity  of  international  students   migrating  from  middle  class  families  from  newly  industrialized  countries  (Waters,   2006;  Zheng,  2010).  Despite  federal  commitment  to  funding  scholarships  for   international  students  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a),  steadily  increasing  numbers  of   international  students  at  Canadian  universities  and  relatively  few  funding   59  

opportunities  make  such  efforts  insignificant.     Employer  engagement.  Results  from  CBIE's  (2007)  survey  on  international   graduates  from  Canadian  institutions  paired  with  the  populations'  experiences  with   Canadian  labour  market  entry,  illustrate  conditions  for  what  Castles  (2004)   describes  as  policy  failure.  Castles  (2004)  explains:  "policy  failure  can  be  said  to   occur  when  a  policy  does  not  achieve  its  stated  objectives"  (p.  854).  Considering  the   objectives  of  Canada's  International  Student  Program,  PGWPP,  CEC,  and  the   International  Education  Strategy,  CBIE's  (2007)  findings  that  international   graduates  are  deterred  from  seeking  employment  in  Canada  due  to  unclear  policies   and  fear  of  discrimination  in  the  workforce,  are  troubling.  Two-thirds  of   international  graduates  in  Canada  will  either  return  home  or  seek  employment  in   other  countries  (CBIE,  2007).  More  problematic  is  the  misunderstanding  by   employers  that  they  are  prohibited  from  hiring  international  students  or  graduates,   an  unsettling  reality  for  the  one-third  of  such  students  who  choose  to  remain  in   Canada  after  graduation  (CBIE,  2007).  Because  the  federal  government  has  done   little  in  the  way  of  promoting  its  liberalized  migration  schemes  for  international   students  post  graduation,  for  example  the  PGWPP,  the  private  sector  has  limited   knowledge  about  the  pool  of  skilled,  locally  educated  labour.  This  indicates  that  the   International  Student  Framework  may  in  fact  be  a  "policy  failure"  (Castles,  2004,  p.   854).        The  international  student  service-programming  scan  found  only  one  

incentive  to  promote  employer  awareness  of  international  graduates  entering  the   Canadian  labour  market.  MUN  offers  international  students  approaching  graduation   60  

from  either  undergraduate  or  graduate  programs  a  semester-long  Professional   Skills  Development  Program  that  builds  employability  skills,  informs  students  of   Canadian  work  culture,  and  connects  students  with  the  local  business  community  to   build  networks  (see  Table  2)  (Gates-Gasse,  2012).  This  program  compliments  career   advising/counseling,  building  a  dual  practical-emotional  network  of  support.  The   literature  on  international  student  career  development  points  to  this  type  of  service   as  beneficial  in  the  population's  labour  market  readiness,  and  thus  an  integral  piece   in  the  social  inclusion  agenda.     Social  capital.  Three-quarters  of  the  universities  in  the  programming  scan   offered  international  students  career  advising  or  counseling  (see  Table  2).  UBC  did   not  advertise  the  availability  of  such  services,  having  no  explicitly  labeled  labour   market  preparation  programs.  Ryerson  University  pairs  career  counseling  with  a   career  mentorship  program,  building  on  the  institution's  well-developed  counseling   and  mentorship  framework.  Ryerson's  Career  Mentorship  Program  and  MUN's   Professional  Skills  Development  Program  each  direct  focus  towards  the  creation  of   social  capital  for  international  students,  building  bridges  and  creating  bonds   between  individuals.  However,  based  on  the  above  areas  of  employer  engagement   and  labour  market  readiness,  more  can  be  done  to  connect  international  students   with  resources  to  explore  labour  market  options.  Traditionally  applied  to   permanent  immigrant  groups  living  in  communities  with  only  co-ethnics,  bonding   social  capital  is  understood  as  the  relationships  with  co-ethnics  that  comforts,   reduces  culture  shock  and  provides  close  social  networks  for  personal  and  family   support  (Putnam,  2006;  Pendakur  &  Mata,  2012).  Conversely,  bridging  social  capital   61  

represents  the  more  difficult  to  form  relationships  with  members  not  affiliated  with   an  immigrant's  ethnic  community.  However,  once  established  these  connections   hold  extensive  benefits  to  an  immigrant's  wider  social  integration,  often  resulting  in   jobs  matching  an  immigrants  qualifications,  rather  than  survival  jobs  available   within  the  ethnic  community  (Putnam,  2006;  Pendakur  &  Mata,  2012).     Similarly,  the  social  capital  theory  is  of  great  importance  to  international   student  populations'  labour  market  and  social  inclusion.  While  the  group  arrives  in   Canada  temporarily,  in  order  to  fulfill  policy  goals  of  transitioning  to  economic   immigrants  and  later  to  permanent  residents,  both  forms  of  capital  are  requisites.   By  assuming  that  international  students  are  capable  of  making  ties  to  the  native   Canadian  community  without  tangible  support  to  do  so,  assumes  that  their  age  and   Canadian  education  negates  the  struggles  of  the  immigrant  experience  in  Canada.   This  is  not  only  untrue,  it  also  represents  a  refusal  by  Canadian  governments  to   acknowledge  the  different  forms  of  knowledge  and  types  of  experiences   international  students  bring  with  them,  which  in  itself  is  a  form  of  discrimination   and  exclusion.     In  relation  to  the  job  market  and  social  inclusion  in  general,  social  capital   theory  can  be  applied  to  international  student  populations  in  the  same  way  that  it  is   applied  to  traditional  immigrant  populations.  As  noted  in  previous  sections  on   language  acquisition,  international  students  find  it  significantly  easier  to  form  ties   with  co-ethnics.  The  literature  has  found  that  while  these  bonding  social  ties   provide  a  form  of  emotional  well-being,  such  relationships  hinder  students'  capacity   to  reach  high  English  proficiencies.  Independently,  international  students  make   62  

connections  with  fellow  international  students  through  the  shared  experience  of   language  struggles  and  an  identity  of  otherness  (Myles  &  Cheng,  2003).  In  similar   fashion  to  the  struggles  of  language  learning,  the  underdevelopment  of  international   students'  bridging  social  capital  for  labour  market  integration,  i.e.  relationships  with   Canadian  students  and  employers,  reduces  their  capacity  to  transition  from  student   life  to  employment  that  corresponds  with  qualifications.  Thus,  social  capital  theories   must  be  merged  with  the  principles  of  social  inclusion  in  order  to  achieve   international  student  policy  success.     In  practice,  this  can  be  approached  by  unification  of  the  intended  outcomes   of  international  student  programming.  For  example,  if  the  purpose  of  all   international  student  services  is  to  assist  non-domestic  students  in  achieving   success  during  (and  potentially  after)  their  studies,  then  it  can  be  said  that  social   inclusion  is  the  end  goal.  Thus,  social  inclusion,  as  the  dismantling  of  barriers  and   the  promotion  of  practical  solutions  for  full  and  equitable  participation  in  social  life,   requires  the  incorporation  of  social  capital.  By  laying  the  groundwork  for   international  students  to  build  relationships,  partnerships,  and  meaningful   experiences  using  the  tools  provided  through  student  services,  the  populations'   presence  in  Canada  could  be  mutually  beneficial  for  students,  communities,   universities  and  governments.     Peer  mentoring.  Based  on  findings  from  the  literature,  peer  mentoring   programs  partnering  international  and  domestic  students  have  yield  positive   results.  However,  these  benefits  have  been  limited  to  facilitating  referrals  to  student   services  and  campus  events,  increased  participation,  and  generally  heightening  the   63  

sense  of  belonging  felt  by  international  students  (Leask  &  Carroll,  2011).  The   university  programming  scan  found  that  only  Ryerson's  Tri-Mentoring  program  and   the  University  of  Calgary's  Global  Friendship  program  present  peer  mentoring   explicitly  as  an  integration  and  inclusion  tool.  It  may  be  that  peer  mentoring  is   offered  as  a  departmental  feature  and  due  to  the  wide-reaching  target  population  of   such  programs,  are  not  connected  to  international  students  specifically  on   universities  websites.     While  beneficial  in  terms  of  emotional  well-being,  the  outcomes  of  peer   mentoring  programs  appear  to  be  superficial  in  relation  to  international  students'   long-term  social  inclusion.  Should  university  peer  mentoring  programs  seek  to   create  bridging  social  capital  in  their  programming  agendas,  and  compliment   student  mentoring  with  professional  mentoring,  it  is  likely  that  other  career- oriented  services,  presently  underused  by  international  students,  would  increase  as   well.  By  blending  access  to  informal  networks  through  institutional  avenues  (Dunn   &  Oliver,  2011),  the  design  of  federal  programs  to  utilize  international  students'   Canadian  education  as  an  integration  facilitating  tool  would  be  considerably  more   effective.        Assessed  as  a  unit,  it  appears  that  the  approach  taken  by  universities  to  

support  and  integrate  international  students  into  the  university  community,   Canadian  society,  and  the  Canadian  labour  market  is  insufficient.  No  guiding  mission   statement  to  address  the  unique  service  needs  of  international  students  was  found   in  the  programming  scan.  Likewise,  no  organizational  framework  was  found  to  be  in   place  to  address  the  gaps  in  international  student  services.  Coordination  was  noted   64  

in  the  literature  as  imperative  for  successful  program  outcomes  (Snow  Andrade,   2006;  Albiom,  2011;  Kamara  &  Gambold,  2011;  Lowe,  2011),  and  so  the  fragmented   approach  to  service  provision  at  present  provides  grounds  for  pessimism.  As  noted   above,  the  least  developed  programming  area  as  it  relates  to  the  core  barriers  for   international  students,  was  labour  market  support.  This  may  mark  a  decisive  action   by  universities  to  reduce  their  participation  in  fulfilling  governmental  policy   objectives.  As  MUNs  collaborative  labour  market  programming  highlights,  the   presence  or  absence  of  employment  readiness  programming  may  signify  the  type  of   relationship  postsecondary  institutions  have  with  the  their  respective  provinces.   That  is,  whether  collaborative  initiatives  are  positive  and  welcomed  by  universities,   or  if  postsecondary  institutions  are  unsatisfied  with  provincial  and  federal  post- secondary  interventions  and  would  prefer  to  maintain  a  level  of  autonomy.  This  is   an  important  area  of  research  that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  project,  however,  the   implications  of  these  relationships  will  play  key  roles  in  the  steps  both  government   and  universities  are  willing  to  take  in  the  social  inclusion  of  international  students.

Section  VI        Recommendations      The  Pathway  Approach  to  Service  Provision      The  above  analysis  of  university  programs  servicing  international  students,  points   to  the  need  for  a  new  service  model  for  post-secondary  institutions.  Based  on  the   findings  from  the  university-focused  literature  (see  Section  III)  and  programming   scan  (see  Section  IV)  the  recommendations  below  are  exemplified  using  the   university  as  a  setting.  However,  with  slight  modifications  the  pathway  approach   suggested  can  be  applied  in  all  designated  PSE  institutions  in  Canada.  The  pathway   approach  uses  Kamara  and  Gambold's  (2011)  pilot  study  as  a  basis,  but  adds  to  it   dimensions  of  social  inclusion  and  federal  policy  success.  The  2011  study  offers  the   first  day  of  international  students'  study  period  as  the  starting  point  for   restructured  international  student  support  framework,  consisting  of  three  phases.   The  first  phase  provides  tools  for  transition  into  the  academic  environment  and  the   campus  as  whole,  in  a  "sociocultural  grace  period"  (Kamara  &  Gambold,  2011,  p.  27)   that  includes  information  on  expectations  and  strategies  for  self-assessment.  The   second  phase  uses  the  information  from  self-assessments  and  positions  the   university  and  its  departments  as  the  primary  service  provider  (Kamara  &  Gambold,   2011).  This  second  phase  includes  many  of  Liu's  (2011)  recommendations  that   highlight  the  importance  of  international  students'  taking  control  of  their  success   through  "autonomous  learning"  (Liu,  2011,  p.  78).  However  it  situates  universities   as  key  actors,  creating  opportunities  for  international  students  to  become  confident   66  

and  contributing  members  of  the  community.  The  third  phase  echoes  Guo  and   Chase's  (2011)  evaluation  of  intercultural  communication  departments,  and   provides  university  staff  and  faculty  with  sociocultural  training  to  support   increasingly  diverse  international  student  populations.  Positioning  members  of  the   teaching  and  administrative  community  with  experience  educating  or  working  with   international  students  as  facilitators,  learning  and  information  sharing  sessions  are   provided  to  promote  the  use  of  cultural  competency  models  campus  wide.  All  staff   and  faculty  in  Kamara  and  Gambold's  (2011)  three-phase  model  are  required  to   familiarize  themselves  with  common  struggles  of  international  students,  the   services  available  to  assist  in  overcoming  these  struggles,  and  fair  and  balanced   methods  for  addressing  these  barriers  to  success.  Such  training  acknowledges  that   the  classroom  is  the  primary,  if  not  only,  site  of  exchange  and  interaction  for  many   international  students.   While  valuable  in  its  own  right,  the  three-phase  model  offered  by  Kamara   and  Gambold  (2011)  lacks  the  capacity  to  successfully  fulfill  federal  policy,  while   simultaneously  creating  the  conditions  for  social  inclusion.  The  proposed  pathway   approach  segments  the  international  student  experience  into  several,  non- sequential  pieces  and  allows  administrators  to  monitor  students'  progression  and   designate  responsibility  to  the  best-equipped  departments  (see  Figure  1  below).  A   pathway  approach  recognizes  that  time  spent  at  a  university  or  in  a  country  does   not  necessarily  dictate  the  type  of  problem  encountered  and  in  turn  cannot   intuitively  decide  the  type  of  support  required;  similarly  students'  cultural,   religious,  ethnic  or  linguistic  backgrounds  cannot  be  used  as  a  basis  for  service   67  

referrals.  International  students  may  choose  to  revisit  parts  of  a  pathway  during   their  international  education  experience.     The  combination-style  service  model  put  forth  below  is  substantiated  by  Moores   and  Popadiuk's  (2011)  finding  that  international  students  have  differing   expectations  of  their  international  education  experience,  as  well  as  Alboim's  (2011)   comment  that  not  all  international  students  plan  to  stay  in  Canada  after  graduation.   Providing  extensive  labour  market  services  to  international  students  who  are   strictly  educational  sojourners  is  not  intuitive  programming.  Likewise,  providing   cultural  support  to  international  students  who  have  completed  secondary  studies  in   Canada  may  not  be  required.  Rather,  a  service  approach  that  educates  international   students  early  is  the  basis  of  the  pathway  approach,  providing  agency  through   inclusion  to  make  informed  decisions  on  their  investment  in  international   education.                                                         68

Before  students  arrive  on  campus  universities  establish  their  pathway  model   by  initiating  communication  with  students  on  preparation  for  success  as  an   international  student.  In  light  of  the  volume  of  information  received  regarding   immigration  and  course  selection,  it  is  recommended  that  universities  action  a  peer   mentoring  program  that  begins  virtually.  Using  this  approach,  international   students  are  paired  with  a  current  student  upon  acceptance  to  university,  with   whom  they  have  online  communications  prior  to  departure,  and  meet  on  arrival.   This  provides  a  connection  to  the  university  and  the  Canadian  community   immediately,  and  begins  the  process  of  acculturation  prior  to  commencement  of   studies  or  arriving  in  Canada  (Snow-Andrade,  2006).  At  present  this  structure  is   only  in  place  under  Mitacs  Globalink  program  for  visiting  researchers  (Mitacs,   2012),  but  has  valuable  potential  in  the  successful  integration  and  social  inclusion  of   international  students  in  Canada,  regardless  of  their  level  of  study.     The  first  weeks  at  university  set  the  stage  for  international  students  level  of   engagement  for  the  entirety  of  their  international  education  experience.  Orientation   provides  an  opportunity  for  international  students  to  make  informal  connections   through  institutionalized  avenues,  creating  a  sense  of  belonging  to  campuses,  and   begin  the  process  of  building  bridging  social  capital.  Paired  with  the  campus   information  gained  during  their  online  communications  with  peer  mentors,   orientation  can  instill  in  international  students  the  benefits  of  creating  local   connections  rather  than  merely  introducing  students  to  services.     During  orientation,  the  pathway  approach  includes  both  integrated  social   and  academic  opportunities  with  domestic  students,  as  well  as  targeted  sessions  for   70  

international  students.  This  uses  Kamara  and  Gambold's  (2011)  socio-cultural  grace   period  as  its  foundation,  but  adds  to  the  self-assessment  component  facilitated   interactions  with  campus  services.  For  example,  if  during  self-assessment  a  student   addresses  their  challenges  with  time  management,  they  are  referred  to  the  student   success  strategies  unit  at  the  university  for  a  consultation.  By  providing   international  students  structured  opportunities  to  interact  with  the  services  they   are  recommended,  the  insecurity  of  making  the  first  contact  will  be  alleviated,  and   will  boost  typically  underused  student  services,  as  per  the  evaluative  literature  on   the  subject  (Popaduik  &  Arthur,  2004;  Gates-Gasse,  2012).  This  process  in  the   pathway  approach  requires  very  little  from  universities  in  terms  of  resources.   Instead  it  encourages  students  to  self-advocate  and  actively  participate  in  their   social  inclusion.     With  roots  in  social  inclusion,  the  pathway  approach  focuses  on  the   mechanisms  of  institutions,  such  as  the  university,  to  equip  once  excluded   populations  with  the  tools  for  active  and  equal  participation.  As  this  analysis  has   highlighted  that  the  university  is  positioned  as  an  institution  with  the  capacity  to   instigate  such  change  for  international  students,  through  coordination  with  other   key  stakeholders.  Following  the  orientation  and  self-assessment  periods  of  the   pathway  approach,  university  administration  appoints  international  students  an   advisor.  Based  on  the  current  roles  of  international  student  offices  at  universities,   and  the  demand  they  face  in  serving  large  and  homogenized  populations  (CBIE,   2007),  it  is  recommended  universities  appoint  an  advisor  to  each  student,  at  a  ratio   of  1:30,  to  increase  the  frequency  and  duration  of  contact  in  this  capacity.  Research   71  

shows  that  international  student  populations  typically  do  not  visit  career  counselors   at  universities  (Popaduik  &  Arthur,  2004;  Snow-Andrade,  2006;  Gates-Gasse,  2012).   This  underuse  is  not  caused  by  international  students'  perception  that  they  do  not   require  assistance;  findings  from  the  CBIE  (2007)  survey  note  that  international   students  recognize  that  their  integration  into  Canadian  society  will  be  difficult.   Rather,  the  rationale  for  this  underuse  of  counseling  and  advising  is  based  on  the   assumption  that  such  services  are  for  crises  and  not  support  (Popadiuk  &  Arthur,   2004).     To  overcome  the  culturally  based  suppositions  about  career  counseling,  and   to  promote  interaction  with  career  support  services,  Popadiuk  and  Arthur  (2004)   suggest  applying  the  cultural  formulation  approach  used  in  psychology.  This   approach  encourages  counselors,  and  student  service  providers,  to  unpack   terminology  for  their  diverse  cliental  (terms  such  as  `career'  and  `counseling'),  apply   students'  cultural  orientation  to  their  advice  (collectivist  vs.  individualist),  and   address  immediate  needs  as  well  as  long-term  goals  (Popadiuk  &  Arthur,  2004).  The   international  student  advisor  works  in  conjunction  with  peer  mentors,  meeting  with   students  periodically  to  discuss  progress,  outcomes  of  services  used,  and  methods   to  improve  student  and  social  life.  Consistent  interaction  with  both  a  peer  mentor   and  an  advisor  ensures  that  international  student  needs  are  being  met  on  an   individual  basis;  a  function  a  phase  approach  cannot  accommodate  due  to  its  linear   progression  and  assumption  of  layered  skill  development.  One  of  the  key  benefits  to   a  pathway  approach  is  that  students  requiring  a  new  type  of  support,  regardless  of   their  time  since  arrival,  have  personal  connections  with  campus  contacts  to  facilitate   72  

success.     Acknowledging  the  barriers  to  success  and  offering  interactive  support   mechanisms  to  facilitate  the  shift  from  exclusion  to  inclusion  is  an  important   differentiation  between  the  social  exclusion  framework  and  the  social  inclusion   framework.  This  reiterates  McGrath's  (2010)  view  that  student  activism  and   institutional  advocacy  have  strikingly  different  capacities  to  instigate  change.  The   former  working  to  draw  attention  to  the  victimization  caused  by  exclusion,  and  the   latter  doing  the  same  yet  moving  beyond  recognizing  exclusion,  and  seeking  to   partner  with  exclusion's  victims  to  overcome  barriers  and  institutions  to  dismantle   them.  In  practice  this  segment  of  the  pathway  approach  can  mitigate  a  number  of   unmet  needs.  For  example,  many  NNES  international  students  begin  subject-study   in  English  for  the  first  time  in  Canada  and  are  not  aware  that  they  require  support,   as  they  have  been  successful  in  their  English  language  studies  prior  to  Canadian   university.  This  may  take  some  time  to  identify  as  students  progress  through  their   first  or  even  second  semester;  having  regular  check-ins  assures  that  barriers  begin   to  be  dismantled  upon  identification.  The  advisor  and  peer  mentor  work  jointly  in   referrals,  providing  ongoing  support  to  students  and  recommending  programs  that   may  suit  the  students'  current  academic,  social  or  employment  needs.     International  students  receive  a  significant  amount  of  information  prior  to   arrival  on  campuses  and  during  orientation,  often  in  a  second  language.  It  is   unreasonable  to  expect  that  tools  and  resources  offered  during  their  first  week  on   campus  will  be  easily  remembered  and  applied  later.  For  instance,  an  international   student  approaching  the  end  of  their  second  year  of  a  four-year  program  may  decide   73  

they  would  like  to  stay  in  Canada  after  graduation.  They  may  remember  the   importance  of  CIC's  language  criteria  in  the  process,  but  not  recount  the  critical   value  in  making  labour  market  connections  or  gaining  Canadian  experience  prior  to   the  job  search  process.  Including  support  along  the  international  student  trajectory   from  arrival  in  Canada  to  graduation  promotes  federal  policy  success.  The  type  of   success  that  the  social  inclusion  perspective  aims  for,  using  the  pathway  model,   especially  in  light  of  heightened  involvement  of  the  multi-sectoral  stakeholders,  is   not  the  mere  filling  of  jobs  in  the  Canadian  labour  market  by  international   graduates.  Rather,  it  is  interaction  with  the  labour  market  plus  the  active   participation  of  international  graduates  in  building  meaningful  careers  and  lives  in   Canada.       Though  the  significant  economic  losses  of  underutilization  of  immigrant   skills  are  well  documented­  estimated  at  a  loss  of  between  $4.6  and  $5.9  billion   annually  (Hire  Immigrants  Ottawa,  2013),  little  is  being  done  currently  to  expand   measures  to  correct  losses  through  outreach  by  businesses  to  international   students/graduates.  In  order  for  universities  to  build  systematic,  practical,  and   sustainable  partnerships  with  the  private  sector,  the  provincial  government  must   become  involved.  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  made  great  strides  in  addressing   provincial  labour  market  needs  by  connecting  the  private  sector  with  graduating   international  students,  and  engaging  Memorial  University  of  Newfoundland  (MUN)   to  implement  a  Professional  Skills  Development  Program  on  labour  market   readiness.  Other  provinces  would  likely  experience  similar  successes  to  those  of   Newfoundland  and  Labrador  should  post-secondary-provincial  partnerships  be   74  

formed.     In  a  pathway  approach,  international  students  have  access  to  the  private   sector  over  the  course  of  their  program  of  study.  Thus,  those  students  who  have   adequate  language  and  academic  skills,  achieved  through  on-going  support  and   targeted  programming,  and  who  have  expressed  interest  in  gaining  Canadian   experience,  are  enrolled  in  a  university-employer  collaborative  program,  like  the   Professional  Skills  Development  Program  offered  by  MUN.  This  process  is  facilitated   by  the  advisor  and  offers  students  the  option  to  begin  labour  market  preparation   well  before  they  seek  employment  as  graduates.  Transparency  is  a  key  component   of  the  pathway  model  and  so,  job  search  and  labour  market  demands  must  be   revealed  to  students  before  they  commit  to  remaining  in  Canada,  requiring   coloration  with  government  bodies.  Similarly,  transition-out  programming  will   become  a  necessary  feature  for  international  students  who  must  apply  the  multiple   functions  of  their  university  skills  to  other  domains  of  social  life.     By  fostering  partnerships,  a  pathway  approach  attempts  to  connect  each   member  of  the  university  community  with  knowledge  on  creating  and  maintaining   the  conditions  for  inclusion  not  only  for  international  students,  but  the  community   as  a  whole.  Kamara  and  Gambold  (2011)  suggest  an  insightful  measure  that  works   well  within  a  pathway  model.  They  recommend  the  engagement  of  experienced   international  students  as  knowledge  ambassadors  to  act  as  informants  on  the   challenges  faced  by  international  students,  bridging  this  knowledge  with  various   departments  across  the  university.  Additionally,  they  could  advise  on  the   opportunities  often  missed  by  staff  and  faculty  to  engage  and  support  the   75

commitment  to  diplomacy  of  knowledge  [...]  giving  the  next  generation  of  Canadian   and  international  students  the  tools  they  need  to  contribute  to  global  society  in   meaningful  ways"  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a,  p.  18).  By  ensuring  equity  in  the  practice  of   international  education  federal  policies  such  as  the  PWGPP  and  the  CEC  can  be   realized.  To  that  end,  the  following  recommendations  are  advanced  to  open  a   dialogue  on  the  multidimensional,  multi-sectoral  issue  of  international  students'   ability  to  participate  fully  in  social  life  in  Canada.  The  framework  of   recommendations  is  rooted  in  the  principles  of  social  inclusion,  and  agrees  with  the   perspective  taken  in  two  recently  commissioned  reports  by  the  Canadian  Council  of   Chief  Executives  (Cappon,  2014;  Simon,  2014).  Each  author  calls  for  the  immediate   establishment  of  a  national  administrative  approach  to  post-secondary  education   with  significant  involvement  from  the  private  sector.  As  such,  the  remainder  of  this   section  will  be  broken  down  by  sector  (see  Table  3,  below),  and  will  then   recommend  the  use  of  an  alternative  student  services  model  for  use  at  the  post- secondary  level.     The  Federal  Government      The  social  inclusion  of  international  students  begins  at  the  federal  level,  because  of   the  federal  facilitation  of  international  students  in  Canada  via  policies,  and   promotional  initiatives  of  international  education  through  the  Imagine  Education   au/in  Canada  campaign.  Federal  support  requires  acknowledgement  that  the   policies  and  programs  increasing  the  number  of  international  students  in  Canada,  as   well  as  the  policies  facilitating  international  students  transition  to  economic  class

immigrants,  must  be  paired  with  resources  to  sustain  such  migration.  As  an  ideal   first  step  this  would  take  the  form  of  increased  transfers  from  the  federal  to   provincial  governments.  Increased  transfers  would  augment  tuition  fees  paid  by   international  students  and  would  carry  conditions  that  funds  be  allocated  to   establish  a  well-developed,  centrally  coordinated  network  of  on-campus  services   that  aim  to  promote  social  inclusion  and  the  creation  of  bridging  social  capital.       In  respect  to  the  conditionality  of  additional  funding  to  the  provinces  for  the   creation  and/or  expansion  of  international  student  supports  at  post-secondary   institutions,  CIC  should  consider  expanding  the  2014  designation  system  for   educational  institutions  wishing  to  accept  international  students  (see  Section  II),  to   include  a  programmatic  designation.  This  could  entail  creating  minimum  standards   for  the  types  of  programs  institutions  must  offer,  which  would  be  federally   supported  by  the  increased  funding  via  provincial  transfers  for  international   education  initiatives.   Working  together  with  the  above  pathway  approach,  CIC  should  begin   information  sharing  with  international  students  applying  for  study  permits.  This   could  work  to  increase  awareness  of  employment  options  during  studies  and  after   graduation,  and  responsibilities  to  meet  specific  criteria,  should  students  choose  to   stay  in  Canada  post-graduation.  Such  a  pre-departure  orientation  mirrors  the   Canadian  Orientation  Abroad  programming  offered  to  immigrants  by  CIC  (CIC,   2012),  and  similarly  uses  web-based  and  in  person  sessions  to  educate  international   students  on  their  journey  ahead.  By  providing  international  students  with   immigration  and  settlement  information  early,  federal  policy  intentions  relating  to   78  

international  students  are  much  more  likely  to  be  fulfilled.     Additionally,  the  CIC  settlement-funding  model  should  be  expanded  to   include  international  students  as  eligible  to  use  immigrant  settlement  services.   While  recent  changes  further  limiting  access  to  temporary  foreign  workers,  refugee   claimants  and  naturalized  citizens  point  to  disconcerting  trends  in  the  boundaries  of   services  (Vineberg,  2014)  the  long-term  economic  intentions  for  international   students  should  position  them  within  the  qualifying  boundaries  for  CIC-funded   settlement  services.  The  immigration  experience  in  Canada  is  understood  as  a   continuum  that  requires  ongoing  support,  positioning  the  current  funding  model   between  CIC  and  settlement  service  providers  as  ineffective  (Chira,  2009).

The  inclusion  of  temporary  migrants  such  as  international  students  as   eligible  for  consumption  of  federally  funded  settlement  services  should  take  place   along  with  the  reconceptualization  of  the  project-based  funding  scheme,  moving   toward  a  core  funding  model.  As  settlement  service  providers  annually  await  their   funding  approvals  they  are  forced  to  issue  layoff  notices  to  their  staff  and  seek  high- interest  lines  of  credit  to  cover  expenses.  While  the  majority  of  funds  distributed  to   settlement  service  providers  are  granted  to  deliver  government  programs,  there  are   little  or  no  resources  allocated  to  cover  costs  beyond  program-related  expenses.   Overall  the  conditions  attached  to  federal  immigrant  settlement  service  funding   effectivity  compromises  the  entire  system,  and  thus  requires  massive  overhaul   (Vineberg,  2014).  The  first  change  on  the  part  of  the  federal  government  requires   acknowledging  that  settlement  services  are  a  permanent  feature  of  the  Canadian   social  service  agenda  and  thus  reorganizing  the  way  in  which  funding  is  distributed   (Vineberg,  2014).  Additionally,  as  immigrants  to  Canada  are  increasingly  temporary,   and  policy  and  economic  success  rely  in  part  on  the  contributions  of  non-permanent   immigrants,  it  is  both  ethical  and  logical  to  extend  settlement  services  to  such   populations.     The  immigration  information  employers  have  access  to  via  CIC  websites  has   created  a  climate  of  confusion,  specifically  in  respect  to  hiring  international   graduates,  and  thus  is  a  barrier  for  international  students  to  build  bridging  social   capital  both  during  and  following  studies  at  Canadian  institutions,  and  create   conditions  for  policy  failure.  CIC  websites  should  be  redesigned  to  provide  clear   immigration  parameters  for  employers  interested  in  hiring  international  students.   81  

The  problematic  structure  of  CIC's  web-based  information  system  noted  by  CBIE   (2007;  2009;  2013),  predate  Simon's  (2014)  recommendation  that  the  federal   government,  CIC,  and  Imagine  Education  au/in  Canada  redesign  websites  to   effectively  communicate  information.  This  is  a  much-needed  step  to  catch  up  with   Canada's  international  education  competitors,  namely  Australia.  The  featureless   web-based  information  outlets  are  in  opposition  to  the  International  Education   Strategy's  objective  to  develop  enhanced  marketing  and  branding  that  resonate  with   the  Strategy's  priority  markets,  and  to  promote  the  private  sector  to  increase   engagement  with  education  initiatives  (Govt.  Canada,  2014a).  With  countries  such   as  Vietnam  and  India  as  primary  target  regions,  a  streamlined  information  system   for  both  students  and  prospective  employers  is  crucial  due  to  the  geographic   positioning  of  the  targeted  markets,  and  their  proximity  to  and  attention  from  other,   perhaps  more  efficient,  providers  of  international  education.     The  Provincial  and  Territorial  Governments        At  the  provincial  level  an  inclusion-based  approach  requires  the  acknowledgement   that  post-secondary  education,  while  technically  the  sole  jurisdiction  of  the   provinces,  is  in  fact  a  shared  responsibility  under  Canadian  federalism.  This  shared   responsibility  is  reflected  in  the  mandatory  transfers  from  the  federal  government   to  the  provinces,  to  ensure  that  consumers  of  education  Canada-wide  are  receiving  a   product  of  a  similar  standard.  Further,  the  long-standing  research  and  development   councils  represent  the  entrenched  federal  presence  in  the  operation  and   advancement  of  post-secondary  education.  However,  the  sharing  of  educational  

82  

administration  is  increasingly  important  due  to  the  federal  government's  focus  on   international  education  and  the  creation  of  immigration  policies  that  facilitate  two- step  migration,  with  users  often  transitioning  through  PNPs.  This  is  multiplied   further  by  the  federal  facilitation  of  international  students  in  Canada  without   supplementation  of  PSE  funding.     As  Canada's  education  system  continues  to  internationalize  and  once  local   programmatic  issues  are  blended  with  issues  of  national  security,  trade,  and   population  management,  it  is  a  logical  progression  to  have  adequate  representation   by  both  levels  of  government  in  higher  education  affairs,  beyond  the  current  federal   presence  in  research  and  development.  As  Australia's  education  minister  stated  on   international  education  in  2013,  "its  not  just  about  education  [...]  It  is  about   Australia's  soft  diplomatic  capacity"  (Simon,  2014,  p.  8).  As  a  nation  outperforming   Canada  in  international  education,  it  may  be  useful  to  integrate  positive  functions  of   the  Australian  approach  into  the  Canadian  method  of  international  education.     By  forming  a  new  type  of  federal-provincial  relationship  around   international  post-secondary  education  focusing  not  only  on  research  and   development  but  also  on  administration,  it  can  be  expected  that  funding  for  core   programs  would  increase  and  in  turn  student  programming  agendas  would  have  the   capacity  to  respond  the  needs  of  international  student  populations.  The  health  care   system  and  the  Canada  Health  Transfer  exemplifies  the  benefits  of  this  type  of   federal-provincial  relationship  (Canadian  Federation  of  Students,  2013),  ensuring   that  resource  allocation  by  the  federal  government  to  the  provinces  remains   consistent,  and  that  provincial  governments  are  able  to  fund  permanent  projects.  As   83  

per  the  recommendations  by  Cappon  (2014),  there  is  a  necessity  for  an   intragovernmental  framework  to  oversee  the  both  the  federal  and  provincial   interventions  in  education,  one  that  sets  goals  and  manages  growth  through   collaborative  and  strategic  design.    The  past  provincial  disappointments  of  federal   involvement  in  PSE  could  be  avoided  in  international  education  specific   collaborations  by  ensuring  the  funding  directed  toward  universities  is  able  to  be   utilized  without  matching  requirements  from  other  sources  (Bakvis,  2008).  Funding   matching  was  a  key  area  of  strain  following  the  establishment  of  the  Canadian   Foundation  for  Innovation,  which  supplemented  PSE  operational  costs,  a  barrier   due  to  the  requirement  that  institutions  cover  60  percent  of  costs  from  other   sources.  In  provinces  with  a  weak  industrial  base,  such  as  those  in  Atlantic  Canada,   this  often  meant  funding  from  provincial  governments  not  originally  intended  for   PSE  use  (Bakvis,  2008).        Issues  of  autonomy  are  amongst  the  most  contested  in  recommendations  for  

increased  collaboration  between  the  federal  and  provincial  governments.    A  key   area  of  concern  is  quality  of  education,  which  connects  to  the  social  inclusion   perspective  regarding  international  students  in  Canada.  The  lack  of  common   standards  in  post-secondary  quality  assurance  is  hindering  the  prosperity  of   international  students  (Meekison,  2011),  due  to  the  programmatic  and  tuition   discrepancies  between  provinces,  and  in  turn  has  resulted  in  a  fragmented  system   through  which  international  education  is  provided.  With  each  province  having  an   autonomous  ministry  of  education  regulating  PSE  within  its  jurisdiction,  the   presence  of  national  educational  leadership  bodies  such  as  the  Association  of   84  

Universities  and  Colleges  of  Canada  (AUCC),  the  Council  of  Ministers  of  Education,   Canada  (CMEC),  and  the  Canadian  Bureau  for  International  Education  (CBIE)  have   ambiguous  roles  in  the  coordination  of  PSE  activities  on  internationally.  While  the   ethical  concern  of  autonomy  in  education  raised  by  post-secondary  administrators   is  valid  in  some  respects,  for  example  in  approving  degrees  that  match  regional   needs  (Meekison,  2011),  there  is  much  to  gain  from  amplified  administrative  and   resource  coordination  with  the  federal  government  as  the  numbers  of  international   students  in  Canada  increase.     Federal  immigration  programs  have  been  designed  to  include  international   students  based  on  their  integration  advantage  over  traditional  economic  migrants.   However,  mismatches  between  policy  intent  and  outcome  highlight  the  need  to   apply  employer  responses  to  hiring  international  graduates  in  a  meaningful  and   functional  way,  i.e.  through  employer  engagement  in  international  student  skill   development.  It  is  recommended  that  provincial  governments,  in  collaboration  with   the  federal  government  where  applicable,  reach  out  to  the  private  sector  and   provide  incentives  for  employers  to  assist  in  building  labour  market  readiness   programs  based  on  their  knowledge  of  the  challenges  of  employing  immigrants.   The  Private  Sector        The  development  of  cooperative  relationships  does  not  end  with  strengthening   intragovernmental  relations.  As  recommended  in  actions  for  the  provincial   governments,  the  private  sector  must  be  actively  engaged  in  skill  development   programs  for  international  students.  By  far  the  most  significant  barrier  between

policy  intention  and  outcome,  in  respect  to  integration  of  immigrant  labour  into  the   Canadian  economy,  is  the  mismatch  between  immigration  criteria  and  employer   needs  or  demands.  In  the  2007  CBIE  report  Northern  Lights:  International  Graduates   of  Canadian  Institutions  and  the  National  Workforce,  a  small  sample  of  20  Canadian   employers  participated  in  a  discussion  on  their  perceptions  of  hiring  international   graduates.  While  the  report  fails  to  include  quantitative  data  on  how  many   employers  did  not  have  knowledge  on  employing  international  graduates,  it  was   noted  that  "many"  were  unaware  of  their  ability  to  do  so,  while  "others"  voiced   concerns  regarding  the  ability  of  international  hires  to  travel  for  work.  Employers'   lack  of  immigration  knowledge  cannot  be  noted  as  the  cause  for  international   graduates  inaccessibility  to  meaningful  participation  in  the  labour  market  from  the   CBIE  (2007)  report  alone,  due  to  the  size  of  the  sample.  However  because  of  the   multitude  of  factors  involved  in  successful  policy  outcomes  and  immigrant   integration,  it  is  probable  that  the  employer-knowledge  factor  is  but  one  element  in   a  causal  nexus  of  international  student  policy  success-social  inclusion.  Further   research  on  the  dynamic  between  employers  and  international  students  is   necessary  to  fully  understand  the  impacts  and  effects  of  this  relationship.       Additional  employer  concerns  on  hiring  foreign  labour  were  voiced  in  the   2012  Employer  Consultation  Report  (IEC  BC,  2012).  Amongst  the  most  prevalent   concerns  were:  English  language  proficiency,  both  general  and  occupation  specific;   the  importance  of  Canadian  experience;  and  the  lack  of  a  "one-stop"  information  site   on  hiring  immigrants  (IEC  BC,  2012).  While  by  no  means  a  comprehensive  list  of   employer-related  concerns  to  hiring  international  graduates,  those  identified   86  

address  the  importance  of  employer  engagement  in  federal  policy  relating  to   international  students,  specifically  the  PGWPP,  the  CEC  and  international  student   stream  of  the  PNP.  Additionally,  employers  should  be  encouraged  to  assume  an   active  role  in  university  co-operative  education  programs  and  career  mentoring   programs.  The  outcomes  of  these  initiatives  are  almost  certain  to  be  mutually   beneficial.  Canadian  employers  are  able  to  assess  the  capacity  of  international   students  to  contribute  to  their  respective  sectors  and  thereafter,  make  informed   recommendations  to  the  federal  government  on  economic  immigration  criteria.  At   the  same  time,  international  students  gain  Canadian  experience  ­  a  key  component   of  successful  labour  market  integration  for  immigrants.     The  Post-Secondary  Sector        The  importance  of  coordination  between  stakeholders  is  paramount  in   reconceptualization  of  international  students  in  Canada  under  both  the   International  Education  Strategy  and  a  social  inclusion  agenda.  However,  despite   the  amplified  role  of  state  actors,  the  private  sector,  and  the  third  sector,  i.e.   settlement  service  providers,  post-secondary  institutions  will  remain  the  primary   point  of  contact  for  international  students.  To  date  there  is  no  national   benchmarking  system  in  place  for  international  student  services  and  as  such   support  systems  are  in  disarray  at  campuses  coast-to-coast  (see  Table  2).  This   fragmentation  is  problematic.  International  students  should  not  be  expected  to   choose  between  a  university  with  advanced  English  support  programming  and  a   university  with  well-developed  connections  to  the  private  sector;  the  system  should,  

87  

and  can,  be  streamlined  and  monitored  though  a  federal  designation  system  (see   above  Table  3).  Kamara  and  Gambold's  (2011)  model  that  includes  strategies  they   describe  as  "holistic  and  preemptive"  (p.  25),  offers  insight  into  a  service  provision   scheme  that  fosters  social  inclusion.  Moving  away  from  the  current  reactive   approach  to  international  student  services  requires  the  creation  of  a  framework  that   takes  a  three-phase  approach.  This  approach  resonates  with  the  aforementioned   studies,  providing  awareness  of  the  international  student  experience;  from  which   themes  of  exclusion  and  even  ghettoization  have  emerged  (Cheng  &  Fox,  2008;  Liu,   2011).     Connecting  post-secondary  institutions  with  the  resources  and  stakeholders   to  successfully  host  international  students  requires  what  Bakvis  (2008)  describes  as   entrepreneurial  university  presidents;  leaders  who  have  close  connections  to  the   private  sector,  the  third,  non-profit  sector,  and  provincial  and  federal  governments.   The  importance  of  this  type  of  leadership  at  post-secondary  institutions  is  vital.  By   liaising  with  key  sectors  of  government  and  society,  entrepreneurial  university   presidents  are  able  to  articulate  the  vision  of  their  institution  and  lobby  for  support   to  facilitate  shared  goals  of  international  education.  Thus,  it  is  recommended  that   post-secondary  institutions  include  characteristics  such  as  entrepreneurialism  in   the  hiring  criteria  for  university  leaders.     Resource  Commitments      Guided  by  neo-liberal  ideology,  one  may  question  why  the  federal  government   would  invest  in  international  student  inclusion  at  all.  Past  policy  failures  of  

88  

economic  immigration  are  central  to  the  argument  for  increased  funding  and   program  development  by  the  federal,  and  to  some  extent  provincial  governments.   Critical  examination  of  neo-liberal  policy  changes  to  the  shift  in  prospective   immigrant  characteristics  suggests  that  systemic  issues  in  the  immigration,   settlement  and  integration  processes  for  Canada's  immigrants  have  been  left   unaddressed.  Instead,  policy  changes  imply  past  cohorts  of  immigrants   unsuccessful,  and  encourage  a  new,  `improved'  demographic  of  immigrant  to   Canada  via  the  repositioning  of  the  International  Student  Program  and  the  Canadian   Experience  Class.  Arguments  advocating  further  download  of  services  onto   universities  ignore  such  these  barriers  to  full  participation,  and  instead  note  post- secondary  institutions  as  the  primary  benefactors  of  international  students  due  to   their  immediate  receipt  of  tuition  fees.  However,  as  international  education   becomes  increasingly  important  to  the  Canadian  economy,  the  federal  government   must  look  only  to  its  close  competitors  in  international  higher  education  to  imagine   the  consequences  of  strictly  growth-oriented  policies  regarding  international   students.  Australia  has  restructured  its  immigration  points  system,  based  on  lack  of   foresight  in  respect  to  accepting  increased  numbers  of  international  students  into   its  PSE  system  without  the  necessary  programs  or  services  to  facilitate  integration   or  inclusion.  The  country's  institutions,  guided  by  federal  policies,  have  graduated   international  students  without  refined  language,  social  or  labour  market  skills.   Based  on  such  skill  underdevelopment,  many  of  Australia's  international  graduates   are  unable  to  meaningfully  engage  with  the  labour  market.  This  in  turn  has  resulted   in  a  system  overhaul  to  ensure  immigrant's  skills  match  labour  market  needs,  i.e.   89  

language,  social  capital  or  cultural/transition  support.  The  costs  associated  with   large  modifications  of  the  immigration  system  due  to  poor  planning  are  far  greater   than  the  costs  of  funding  programs  to  facilitate  and  manage  the  inclusion  of   international  students  in  Canada.     At  the  provincial  level,  resource  allocation  can  be  as  large  or  small  as  the   province  is  capable  of  investing  into  engagement  of  the  private  sector  for  the   purpose  of  maximizing  the  value  of  locally  trained  and  workforce  ready  populations.   Policy  recommendations  (see  Table  3)  for  increased  federal  funding  of  international   PSE  have  included  safeguards  for  less  economically  well-to-do  provinces.  This  is   achieved  by  removing  funding  matching  as  a  qualifier  for  higher  education   institutions  to  receive  increased  federal  investment.     As  explained  throughout  the  description  of  the  pathway  approach,  post- secondary  institutions  can  adopt  an  inclusive  programming  agenda  largely  through   engagement  of  existing  employees  and  experienced  international  students.   Additional  support  for  new  programs  should  be  funded  through  increased  federal- provincial  transfers  with  the  condition  that  resources  be  used  to  support  initiatives   of  the  International  Education  Strategy,  as  well  as  through  the  allocation  of  a  portion   of  differential  fees  paid  by  international  students.  Further  investment  by  the   university  is  based  on  cost  of  hiring  advisors  for  international  students;  depending   on  the  ratio  of  students  to  advisors,  this  cost  would  vary.   In  order  for  the  proposed  pathway  approach  to  achieve  success  at  the   university  level,  increased  funds  by  CIC  are  required  to  create  and  administer  a  pre- departure  orientation  for  international  students,  a  valuable  investment  based  on  the   90  

2014  commitment  in  the  International  Education  Strategy  to  strengthening  the   country's  international  education  market.  Strengthening  means  supporting,  and  for   CIC  this  means  resource  allocation,  and  an  active  role  in  orienting  international   students  on  the  opportunities  and  potential  challenges  of  their  migration  journeys.   Funding  for  an  additional  step  in  the  institutional  designation  process  must  also  be   included.  This  is  critical  in  assessing  the  strength  of  support  received  by   international  students  at  post-secondary  institutions.  It  is  this  function  of  the   pathway  approach  that  is  likely  to  receive  the  most  pushback  from  higher  education   institutions;  however,  it  is  a  necessary  step  in  the  comprehensive  inclusion  of   international  students  in  Canada.  The  potential  tension  in  the  implementation  of  a   federal  mechanism  of  evaluation  for  university  support  programs  will  likely  be  due   to  the  current  relationship  between  governments  and  post-secondary  institutions.   While  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  analysis,  this  lack  of  cooperation  is  a  matter  that   requires  immediate  attention,  not  just  in  relation  to  international  student  support,   but  as  a  core  issue  in  the  fragmentation  the  entire  higher  education  sector  in   Canada.       The  Social  Inclusion  Perspective,  Revisited   All  vulnerable  populations  are  acknowledged  in  the  guiding  policies  and  mandates   of  universities  Canada-wide.  However,  1social  inclusion  "...  is  proactive.  It  is  about   anti-discrimination.  It  is  not  about  the  passive  protection  of  rights;  rather  it  is  about   the  active  intervention  to  promote  rights"  (Saloojee,  2003,  p.  15).  Beginning  with  the   university,  the  phased/pathway  approach  should  be  extended  to  include  other   important  actors  in  the  creation  of  successful  outcomes  of  federal  policy  relating  to   91  

the  future  roles  of  international  students  in  the  Canadian  economy.  The  private   sector  must  be  engaged,  informed  and  trained  on  how  to  include  cultural   competency  into  hiring  practices.  As  it  stands,  immigrants  to  Canada  are  not  being   utilized  to  their  full  potential,  resulting  in  disappointing  outcomes  for  immigrants   and  governments  alike.  A  plethora  of  federal  policy  shifts  to  maximize  the  economic   capacities  of  immigrants  to  Canada  can  be  written,  but  social  inclusion  through   creation  of  social  capital  and  systemic  support  mechanisms  are  the  essential   building  blocks  for  generating  positive  experiences  and  successful  policies.        Finally,  the  ethical  dimension  of  encouraging  international  students  to  

migrate  permanently  to  Canada  must  be  considered.  Canadian  federalism  has   resulted  in  a  somewhat  disconnected  relationship  in  fulfilling  the  intentions  of   Canada's  International  Education  Strategy.  Provincial  governments  administer   education,  and  immigration  policy  falls  under  the  federal  government  (Bakvis  &   Skogstad,  2008).  Increasingly,  however,  non-governmental  institutions  have  been   delegated  responsibilities  traditionally  assumed  by  the  various  levels  of   government,  and  so  too  have  the  obligations  to  ensure  successful  policy  outcomes   (Evans  &  Shields,  2000).  In  the  context  of  international  students  in  Canada,   responsibility  for  successful  international  student  related  policy  outcomes  have   been  passed  to  universities  without  their  consent.  The  social  inclusion  perspective   on  the  fulfillment  of  federal  policy  relating  to  international  students,  as  applied  in   this  analysis,  has  sought  to  engage  international  student  populations  as  partners  in   their  educations  and  migration  intentions.  The  ethical  dilemma  of  "brain  drain"   (Gates-Gasse,  2012,  p.  290)  is  at  the  core  of  university-level  underdevelopment  of   92  

international  student  support  services.  This  perspective  views  attempts  to  retain   such  students  as  potential  immigrants  as  problematic  due  to  the  negative  impacts  of   such  retention  on  the  economies  of  sending  countries  (Gribble,  2008).  Thus,  it  sits  in   opposition  to  the  neo-liberal  race  for  talent  that  has  guided  federal  policy.  It  is   critical  to  the  health  of  Canada's  International  Education  Strategy,  that  the  social   inclusion  of  international  students,  and  the  contributions  such  populations  are  able   to  make  in  Canada  and  abroad  that  ideological  conflicts  are  mediated  and  a   compromise  is  reached.  As  per  the  recommendations  offered  above,  mutual  benefits   can  be  experienced  for  all  stakeholders  of  international  education  should  social   inclusion  guide  Canada's  endeavours  in  international  education.     This  organizational  structure  of  education  in  Canada  has  resulted  in  a  lack  of   consensus  on  the  intended  goals  and  outcomes  of  international  students  in  Canada.   The  pathway  approach  described  above  puts  forth  a  framework  by  which   collaborative  international  student  support  services  can  be  established  through   multi-sectoral  cooperation.  Based  on  the  current  conflicts  on  the  rationale  for   international  students  in  Canada,  mediated  discussions  between  the  governments,   universities  and  the  private  sector  must  take  place  to  clearly  outline  the  benefits   each  actor  has  to  gain  is  a  critical  starting  point,  and  in  turn  their  responsibilities   and  expectations.  Programming  to  ensure  advanced  language  skills  to  qualify  for   career  employment  in  Canada  or  permanent  residency  pathways,  as  well  as  career   mentorship  to  build  social  capital  to  succeed  in  Canada's  competitive  labour  market   are  at  present  responsibilities  to  be  assumed  by  university's  student  services.  But   the  extent  to  which  universities  are  solely  responsible  for  creating  the  conditions   93  

necessary  for  successful  policy  outcomes,  or  to  rectify  the  causes  of  exclusion  caused   by  wider  structural  issues  is  highly  debatable.  After  all,  labour  market  struggles,   language  proficiency  issues  and  accessing  opportunities  to  build  bridging  social   capital  are  not  unique  to  international  students;  rather,  they  are  common  immigrant   issues,  Canada-wide  (Lowe,  2011).     The  pathway  approach  is  a  proactive  model  that  has  the  potential  to  engage   all  relevant  stakeholders  in  the  social  inclusion  of  international  students,  as  well  as   in  the  fulfillment  of  federal  policy  intentions  in  respect  to  the  populations'  economic   role.  It  has  the  possibility  to  promote  policy  success  at  all  levels  of  government  and   in  universities.  However,  it  is  by  no  means  the  only  approach.  Any  inclusive   approach  first  requires  the  federal  government  to  examine  its  policies  and  consider   what  responsibilities  are  being  handed  to  other  levels  of  government  or  non-state   actors.  If  the  federal  government  is  unsuccessful  with  its  federal  policies,  then  one  of   two  things  must  happen.  One,  leave  the  policies  as  is  or  modify  the  policy  so  no   other  actors  are  required  to  ensure  success.  The  first  approach  requires  action   through  a  bolstered  network  of  institutions  and  other  levels  of  government  that   provide  the  tools  and  resources  for  policy  success.  This  may  entail  using  a  pathway,   phase,  or  other  multi-sectoral  approach.  The  alternative  involves  modifying  the   policy  so  no  additional  actors  are  required  to  achieve  success.  The  latter  could  mean   that  study  permits  assume  similar  points-system  characteristics,  whereby  students   are  assessed  in  the  same  ways  as  economic  applicants,  while  the  former  makes  use   of  the  capacities  of  stakeholders  to  develop  the  shape  the  skills  of  immigrants  and   promote  their  success.     94  

Section  VII        Conclusion      The  analysis  in  this  paper  has  sought  to  assess  the  quality  and  quantity  of  programs   and  services  for  international  students  at  Canadian  universities.  It  is  based  on  the   current  federal  policies  seeking  to  attract  and  retain  international  students  as   economic  immigrants  in  the  context  of  neo-liberalism  and  the  global  agenda  of   higher  education.  Contending  that  the  extent  to  which  programs  provide   international  students  with  the  tools  necessary  to  integrate  into  academic,  social,   and  professional  life  in  Canada  are  not  merely  concerns  for  post-secondary   institutions,  the  paper  argues  for  a  multi-stakeholder  solution.  The  involvement  of   many  different  actors  with  strikingly  distinct  anticipated  outcomes  requires   collaboration,  cooperation  and  coordination  to  address  the  ways  in  which  federal   policy  objectives  have  created  the  conditions  for  the  international  students'   exclusion  and  to  examine  inclusive  solutions.     With  the  political  spotlight  now  on  international  students  to  successfully   graduate  from  postsecondary  institutions  in  Canada  and  seamlessly  transition  into   the  labour  market  and  permanent  residency,  the  need  for  international  student- specific  programs  and  services  is  greater  than  ever.  While  the  core  challenges   causing  the  failure  of  policies  relating  to  international  students  are  due  in  large  part   to  the  different  jurisdictional  responsibilities  of  international  education  and  the   resulting  intragovernmental  tensions,  there  is  an  immediate  need  for  compromise.   It  is  both  unfair  and  unrealistic  for  universities  to  fund  and  administer  all  services   international  students  require  for  full  societal  participation.  The  pathway  approach   95  

provides  one  possible  course  of  action  available  for  international  student   stakeholders  to  create  an  inclusive,  structured  and  intuitive  service  framework  that   also  incorporates  flexibility  and  individuality.  Due  to  the  long-standing  engagement   and  frequent  interaction  with  international  student  populations,  post-secondary   institutions  have  been  recommended  to  continue  administering  the  majority  of   support  services.     Each  stakeholder  identified  in  this  analysis  has  definite  benefits,  but  in  order   to  reap  them  investment  is  required.  The  real  costs  of  modifying  policies  and   implementing  a  pathway  program  varies,  however  it  is  certain  that  it  will  require   increased  transfers  from  the  federal  government  to  the  provinces  with  the   conditions  that  funds  allocated  to  post-secondary  institutions  are  directly  applied  to   targeted  international  student  support.  The  integration  of  a  program  evaluation   function  to  work  in  tandem  with  CIC's  designated  institution  process  will  ensure   that  there  is  standardization  in  the  international  student  experience  in  Canada.  This   will  work  to  fulfill  the  federal  policy  intentions  of  the  International  Student   Program,  as  well  as  the  PGWPP,  CEC  and  PNP,  all  of  which  require  that  international   students  have  refined  labour  market  and  language  skills.  For  those  students  who  do   not  wish  to  remain  in  Canada  after  graduation,  the  support  received  during  their   studies  in  Canada  will  ensure  they  are  ambassadors  to  Canadian  education  in  their   home  countries,  or  elsewhere,  facilitating  the  ongoing  expansion  of  the  Canadian   brand  of  international  education.       The  disagreement  between  governments  and  universities  regarding  which   actor  is  the  true  benefactor  of  international  students  in  Canada  was  highlighted   96  

throughout  this  analysis  due  to  the  enormous  barrier  the  dispute  has  caused  for  the   development  of  sustainable  and  effective  programs  for  the  social  inclusion  of   international  students.  To  that  end,  social  inclusion  was  used  as  a  measure  for   assessing  the  successes  of  federal  policy,  because  of  the  perspective's  identification   of  the  multidimensional  needs  of  individuals  to  thrive  in  society,  as  well  as  its   action-oriented  institutionally  based  method  of  dismantling  barriers.  Applying  the   social  inclusion  perspective  has  enhanced  the  understanding  of  the  precise  ways  in   which  policy  has  caused  a  chain-reaction  of  exclusion  for  international  students  in   the  various  institutions  the  population  passes  through,  both  as  students  and   economic  immigrants.  The  principles  of  social  inclusion  have  not  yet  been  applied  in   scholarly  writing  to  the  integration  of  temporary  immigrant  populations  such  as   international  students.  Thus,  the  analysis  provided  in  this  paper  offers  not  only   suggestions  for  international  student  populations,  but  to  other  populations  as  well.   Based  on  democratic  citizenship  and  fostering  community  through  collective  action,   the  social  inclusion  perspective  approaches  policy,  practice  and  lived  experiences  as   interconnected  phenomena.  This  paper  has  advanced  the  social  inclusion   perspective  as  a  working  model  to  assess  exclusion  for  non-traditional  societal   groups,  such  as  temporary  migrants,  and  suggest  multi-stakeholder  solutions  ­  an   increasingly  necessary  strategy  in  the  present  political  climate  of  austerity.     To  conclude  this  exploration  of  international  students'  social  inclusion  and   the  success  of  federal  policy  relating  to  the  population,  it  is  important  to  remember   that  there  is  no  one  method  by  which  to  realize  a  policy's  goals.  Rather,  there  are   socially  responsible  ways  that  promote  inclusion  and  participation,  and  there  are   97  

top-down  methods,  which  set  hard  to  reach  targets  without  adequate  support,  and   too  often,  lead  to  disappointing  outcomes.  As  Hawthorne  (2011)  cautions  in  her   comparative  assessment  of  the  Australian  and  Canadian  International  Student   Programs,  "the  lack  of  quality  assurance  could  risk  such  students  being  `treated  as   commodities  in  a  marketplace  that  charges  top  dollar  for  low-grade  education  and   training'"  (Hawthorne,  2011,  p.  55).  While  the  key  to  creating  the  conditions  for   inclusion  and  successful  policy  outcomes  are  not  straightforward,  the  deficiencies  of   the  current  approach  are  readily  evident.  Engaging  all  necessary  stakeholders,   defining  responsibilities,  and  strengthening  funding  are  the  first  steps  toward   achieving  efficient  and  inclusive  polices  and  practices  for  international  students  in   Canada.
