INTRODUCTION
1. Introduction

The debate surrounding the optimal method to heat a house is one that rages on in

hardware stores, product brochures and internet forums alike. The primary question in this debate is: `Should a house remain at constant temperature throughout the day, or should the temperature be modulated to obtain some level of perceived efficiency to the building owner?' Tied in with that question is another area of interest which asks `whether or not a property's heating system should be controlled from a centralized thermostat, or When posed with these, a question became obvious; `Can a model house be built from realistic materials which can deliver the answers?' Additionally, asked myself if some focus of this thesis to find the answers. from multiple thermostats located around the house with zoned-off heating mechanisms?' simplified models could be validated against empirical results to suit those who aren't

experts at thermodynamics? The questions above were burning inside me, so I made it the The home comfort industry seems to think that temperature modulation is the route to will most likely be hard-pressed to find a thermostat that isn't programmable. Take the

The next question arises from today's push to incorporate `smart' technologies into

homes to strive for overall energy efficiency. The technology is now available to isolate rooms from each other (in terms of heat/air distribution) and coupled with room-bycurrents that occur in nature, where hot air masses will always rise to the top of a room thermostats, allows independent monitoring and control of heating demands in vessel, leaving colder masses at the bottom (see Figure 1). It is for this reason that, in Zoned heating systems are theoretically able to mitigate these temperature gradients by applying heat only where it is necessary as determined by the commanded heat setting in a particular zone [2]. general, the basements in dwellings will be noticeably cooler than the upper floors. rooms. The most trivial use for this type of scheme arises from the natural convention

BACKGROUND TO PROBLEM

2. Home Heating Systems

The principles behind this thesis will be much more understandable with a general houses.

overview of how heating systems are typically configured and installed in today's modern The vast majority of North American houses utilize a central heating system which can vary in terms of its prime heating source and delivery medium. A large number of systems rely the heated air through metal ducting to heat rooms in a house. Other systems utilize an electric-resistive source to generate the heat, and it is similarly distributed with a blower on a natural gas burner heating an air-to-air heat exchanger, with a blower which circulates throughout a house. Conversely, the same two systems mentioned above can also utilize water or glycol as the heat transfer medium utilizing smaller pipes routed throughout a house.

All of these systems have the ability to be controlled from a centralized thermostat, or from multiple thermostats mounted throughout a house to heat only the rooms which require a temperature adjustment. Systems which allow independent control of temperature in retrofitted into existing dwellings. different rooms around the house are known as zoned systems. Systems of this nature are

popping up more and more with the `smart home' movement and, in some cases, are being Regardless of the heat exchange medium (air, water etc.), zoning is achieved by redirecting or cutting-off the flow of the medium based on readings from zone-by-zone thermostats. The theory behind this system is that only the rooms which require adjustment will be passive system where all rooms are tended to at once, determined by the readings of a

single thermostat. In this case, dampers are manually adjusted by occupants and leave little room for customization.

Figure 2 - Diagram of a Standard Passive Forced-Air System (adapted from [3])

Figure 3, on the other hand, shows the setup of a 2-zone system which has actively-

controlled dampers via thermostats in each zone. As a side note, the reader must know that zoned systems typically require bypass valves, or variable-speed fan blowers to discharge or cut back on air flow to compensate for the potential decrease in apparent pipe volume. System manufacturers provide the necessary hardware and guides to accomplish this.

While a zoned system may make more sense on face value because of the potential for

energy savings, it does have the disadvantage of being more difficult to retrofit into an

existing house due to the need to install control systems in each room as well as dedicated multiple rooms off of one duct run in order to save on material cost (this can reduce the and the ongoing energy required to power the control system. Having said this, it may make economic sense to install such a system into new home installations and a quick conclusion on this cost will be made later on in the study. customizability of a system). On top of this is the added cost of control system hardware

Homes and building are typically insulated during their construction to decrease the amount of heat loss a building might experience. Before an interior wall is closed in, interior voids are filled with an insulating material from floor-to-ceiling. There are three main types of insulation used in today's homes: fibreglass (pink), mineral-based (Roxul) and closed-cell spray-in foam. In specialized applications, expanded polystyrene (EPS) maybe be used [5]. Insulations are rated based on their R-value, resistance to heat and fire

as well as acoustic damping capabilities. Principal importance to a typical home owner is defined as: the R-value, which states how well a type of insulation will keep heat in. R-value can be

In order to go through with the study, an experimental apparatus was designed and built to create a miniature heating ecosystem. In its simplest form, the constructed building was based on one-storey of a 6.096m x 12.192m house. The dimensions of this house were residence in order to keep a realistic floor plan and volumetric area to heat. The dimensions of the model home were set to 0.9144m x 1.8288m.

The heating scheme designed for the model house is an electric-resistive, forced-air system with heating modules in each room. Each of these heating modules is comprised of a highpower 25 resistor running at 24V and a small 12V fan blowing directly on top of it to disperse the heat and simulate the air flow in a normal house's forced air system (see Figure 10). These are, in turn, mounted on top of an aluminum mounting plate and

to its relative ease of construction and control, low cost and high degree of reliability as piping hardware. Furthermore, using resistors of a known value greatly simplifies the trivial. compared to a centralized forced-air system which would require exotic controls and calculation of energy inputted into the system since the formulas for power/energy are

Figure 10 - Components of the Heating Modules Found Throughout the Model House

The thermistors and heating modules were mounted throughout the model house with a certain degree of randomness (see Figure 11) rather than in centralized locations. The hope with a random placement was to develop some discussion points after experimentation.

15

Figure 11 - Plan View of the Model House Showing the Location of Thermistors (T) and Heating Modules (H)

In the case of the larger rooms (1 & 2), it makes sense to scatter the heating modules far away from each other such that the room can be heated in an even manner. The thermistors in those two rooms were mounted on the walls, rather than in the exact centre of the rooms in order to mimic the conventions used for thermostat mounting in today's provide some insight into factors that can affect heating performance (more on this in not interesting as rooms, in practice, are not designed in this manner. Chapter 5). It is reasonable to think that if the room layouts were identical (everything homes. The layouts used in rooms 3 & 4 were selected in such a way that would hopefully centrally mounted) that equal amounts of energy would be required to heat them.

This particular controller has the advantage of being low-cost, offers a large number of digital/analog inputs and outputs and is relatively simple to program because of the temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors which act as the temperature company-supplied LabView drivers. The house is equipped with Semitec 103JT-75 negative

sensors/thermostats in each room (as well as one for outside temperature tracking) as seen in Figure 14. They are placed directly on the surface of the wall such that they are measuring ambient temperature on a per-room basis (inspired from [9]).

As the temperature of the thermistor changes, so does its internal resistance. The change in voltage observed across the thermistor can be interpreted as a temperature change based on manufacturer data and captured for further use. One hang-up associated with thermistors is that their internal semiconducting materials tend to follow a non-linear trend, except within small ranges of temperature; see Figure 16. It is important to select a thermistor which exhibits a loosely linear trend in the range in which the application will operate. Having said that, the thermistor in question exhibited a very shallow parabolic hardware implementation. trend within the desired temperature range and this had to be considered during the

Knowing the anticipated voltage values at fixed temperatures allows parabolic curve fitting to occur. From rudimentary mathematics, we know that a parabola can be expressed in its standard form as:

y = Ax 2 + Bx + C

In this case, voltage (v) can be taken as the input to the equation allowing the following representation:

Temperature = Av 2 + Bv + C

and temperature can be simultaneously solved in order to determine the three unknown coefficients, A, B and C. This now enables the LabJack controller to multiply and add this particular case, A, B and C were found to be -27.027, 189.189 and -296.555

It is important to note that the use of a parabolic relation dictates the need to keep

temperature set-points within a relatively narrow range to avoid approaching the apex of R1. The value used in this study of 2.2k was selected in order to have the voltage values correspond to a useable range of temperature.

To be sure that the temperature, in fact, correlates to the `real' temperature of the dwelling, it is necessary to calibrate the thermistors using known thermal reference points. Discrepancies in actual temperature-to-solved temperature can be caused by resistor tolerances and voltage drops on sensing wires. Calibration due to steady-state errors of this

type mentioned above (ie., DC bias errors) can be corrected by modifying the value of C to provide the accurate offset. This process is performed simply by comparing the values of case, a solution of ice water was used to verify that the thermistors read 00C when

The electrical bill of materials and schematic for the model house can be seen in Table 15 and Figure 31 respectively. The control method is designed with simplicity in mind and utilizes 5V (gate-source) MOSFETS to pull the coils of relays to neutral, thus turning them on. In this case, MOSFETS were preferred because of their low gate current requirement as

The purpose of this diode is to provide a path to neutral during transient switching events. The electrical engineers in the audience will remember that a relay coil looks like an inductor and switching such a device can cause voltage spikes governed by the equation:

some valid reasons for this. First and foremost, the full heating power of the house equates

Conveniently, the author had a 24V (750W) power supply lying around, so it was determined that main heating power would come from this source. Once this selection was made, the first electrical hurdle was then made to add a 12V power supply for the sole purpose of powering the fans. flow rate (and price!!) to match up with the volumetric requirements. The decision was encountered. At the time of construction, it was difficult to source 24V fans with a desirable Once these two constraints were taken care of, 5V relays were selected to turn on the

The resulting issue was grossly inaccurate temperature readings on the

Taking a look at Equation 1, R2 is directly proportional to the network's source voltage, Vin. When relays began to click LabView gauge display. It was, therefore, decided to power the 5V relays from a separate

It was mentioned in Section 3.1 that the model house test-bed was scaled down by a linear scaling factor of 6.6667 from the Author's current place of residence. This scaling factor also corresponds to the model house lacking 44.44 times (6.66672) the amount of surface equivalent as seen in Table 16 and Table 17. The vast majority of heat transfer in this area, as well as 296.30 times (6.66673) the amount of volume. The specific thing to note is

Without this exercise, the air in the room would heat up and cool down much too quickly which is not an accurate representation of real life The procedure for ballasting the rooms is as follows (using values from Table 17) : Calculate the volume of a full-size room:

The total wall surface area is calculated to be 81.49m2 Calculate the volume of a scaled-down room:

Now, it follows that the volume-to-surface ratios are: and

Now, taking the difference between the required volume of air and the volume of air that is already the room can hold yields the excess volume of air required:

vair reqd = 1.55m3 - 0.23m3 = 1.32m3

And from this, we can calculate that the mass of air required:

mair reqd =  air vair reqd mair reqd = 1.619kg

Armed with this mass, we can calculate the amount of thermal mass that this represents using the specific heat of air:

mthermal air = mair reqd c p air mthermal air = 1615.67 J K

Unfortunately, a problem arises from this; the only way to add excess air mass to the house (assuming constant volume rooms) is by forcibly pressurizing it. To accomplish this, a have to be perfectly sealed to avoid leakage of heated air. An arrangement like this is horribly impractical as was, therefore, decided against. Using the specific heat of air and another substance, we can calculate the amount of As was indicated earlier, concrete was selected due to its high density. source of compressed air would have to be connected to the house and the house would

From the above details of the model house construction methodology, it should be obvious that certain limitations exist.

The rationale behind this schedule is that the house should be reasonably comfortable for the building occupants for the duration of their time at home. This assumes, of course, a trial can be seen in Figure 39. Analysis of this data set tells us that 786 "on" points were Clearly, we have found the more efficient solution. family where all of the occupants are away for the majority of the day. The results of this registered, meaning that the furnace was on for a total of 6.55 hours over a 24-hour period.

5.10. Tuning the Model House: How Did We Do?

In Chapter 3, the details of model house construction and ballasting with known thermal model house's heating response time with the hopes of providing more realistic heating figures. From [13], a slight variation of the Fourier heat model can be derived which is form of exponential decay and is as follows:

masses was described. As was discussed, the ballasting was done in order to slow down the particularly useful for scenarios when you have experimental data. This model takes the

Equation 4 - Exponential Decay Formula Used to Calculate Heat Gain/Loss

The ratio of b/a is the decay factor of the house which will govern the rate at which heat is lost. This equation can be manipulated to show that:

t=

 Thigh - Tout  a log   b  Tlow - Tout 

Equation 5 - Expanded Formulation of equation 4 allowing for Initial and Final Conditions

Once I discovered this derivation, I decided that I could gather some data from the model house (and later, a full-sized house) in order to empirically calculate the respective b/a. determine if I had constructed the house in a manner which modeled real life. The model Armed with a data set from the model house and full-sized house, I would then be able to

house was programmed to run a series of temperature ramp-up/cool down sessions as can be seen in Figure 34 which allowed me to gather vital data to show the house's natural response during cool down periods (i.e,, no heat being generated equals no forcing function). I quickly rearranged the above equation to suit my data set:

 Thigh - Tout  -1 b = log  t a  Tlow - Tout 

Equation 6 - Rearranged Representation of Equation 5

After the trial ran, the data was plotted in Figure 34 and I began to grab data points.

Unfortunately, the nature of the LabJack's circuitry created a lot of noise on readings, so I use the midpoint in time as the applicable time marker. The results were inputted into Microsoft Excel for speed and solutions are presented in Table 9.

According to this data, it appears that the model house was built in such a way that yielded a b/a approximately 10 times higher than that of the full-sized house. According to this sized house.

Going back to Equation 5, we can use our calculated b/a values with an arbitrary outdoor temperature to verify how long it would take for the model and full size houses to decay from an initial point-to-a final resting temperature. In both cases, the global parameters were selected as follows: · · · Tlow = 150C Tout = 100C Thigh = 200C

Plugging in these values, it was found that it would take 3.02 hours for the model house to hours for the full-sized house to cool down. These results point to the obvious conclusion house.

Doing this will increase the longer periods of time when unoccupied. ability of your home to store heat, thus allowing you to turn off your heating systems for

To answer this question, the study relied entirely on the tests run on the scale-model house

Although not as dramatic as the full-sized house test comparisons, with a room-by-room heating system as compared to a central heating system, which heats all rooms simultaneously. Even though precautions and plans were put in place during the design/construction energy gains of approximately 10% were observed by configuring the scale-model house

The reader must also realize that the underlying assumption for this whole study has been that the property occupants would be comfortable going on about their normal business with acceptable minimum and maximum temperature settings. Some people may find it comfortable to sleep within the National Sleep Foundation's temperature guidelines for proper sleep [16], while other occupants may prefer higher or lower temperature environments for sleeping or daily activities. For example, a fluctuating temperature scheme may not be acceptable for young infants, elderly people or rental units. In those cases, some temperature extremes may not be possible due to health, safety and legal concerns. For instance, the City of Mississauga, Ontario mandates that rental dwellings must be kept at a minimum of 200C throughout select portions of the year [17]. As is the

case with a lot of energy conservation ideas, the human factor typically dictates the degree of gains to be had. As an aside, if the reader wished to optimize their house's heating costs, the suggestion would be to run a series of tests on their house in order to characterize the temperature preferences of their particular occupants throughout the day. All that is

required is a simple method of logging indoor/outdoor temperature and furnace operation. As long as the initial experimental conditions are identical then different schemes can be set and the results observed.

Regardless of the issues faced above, the ultimate goal of the study was met and that was to be able to draw definite conclusions on the optimal way to heat a house via experimental means.

In Chapter 2, zoned systems for real homes were introduced, but no conclusion was drawn on whether or not it makes economic sense to implement a zoned system in a house. The minimal bill of materials to required implement a 4-zone system is presented in Table 11.

the aid of software packages. From [12], it can be seen that the complexity of heat transfer For instance, the finite difference model for the 2-D case can be represented by a series of

58

Figure 30 - Pictorial of the Finite Difference 2-D Heat Loss Model [12]

The theory behind this representation is that the heat transfer plane can be broken down into finite chunks with a point-source heater in each block. Using this analysis, heat for this model is as follows: transfer in two directions can now be considered and the results have the ability to be much more accurate than the 1-D planar model used in this study. The governing equation

The complexity associated with this model now dictates that solving must occur in a

recursive method, best implemented in Matlab or similar software package for n,m sections of area. This would be applied to a full-sized house model to see, once again, if a reliable heat-transfer model could be produced. Ultimately, software packages from firms such as ANSYS are designed to solve computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The packages can also be

used to generate mesh plots of heat transfer given an environment and material properties.
