This thesis project discusses the preservation of acclaimed twentieth century artist Andy Warhol's Family Album. The album is comprised of Polaroid photographs he took and gathered in the early seventies. A highlight of Andy Warhol's use of instant photography, as it pertains to his life and artistic work, is provided to present a concise basis to researchers. It details the steps undertaken to safely house this valuable object to prolong its life, and the cataloging methodology followed to grant access to the album without submitting it to excessive handling wear. It also offers recommendations on the preservation of dye diffusion material such as Polaroid's Polacolor and SX-70 film types.

Introduction

Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was renowned for his contribution to the pop-art movement. His distinctive style as a printmaker, painter and cinematographer influenced generations of artists. His fascination with glamour and celebrities, as well as his extensive entourage of stars also help to shape the legend. Less known to the public is his photographic work that served as raw material for his artwork.1 In September 2013, George Eastman House director Bruce Barnes received a letter from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (the Foundation) outlining the scope and conditions of a proposed gift to the institution. In honor of its 25th anniversary, the Foundation was disseminating a substantial part of Warhol's photographic legacy by donating it to selected museums. George Eastman House had been selected as one of six establishments to receive a "Family Album" comprised of Polaroid prints made by Warhol in the early 1970s. This gift fits with Barnes' priorities as a director to expand the collection's holding of works from painters for whom photography is/was an integral part of their creative process. Prior to the acquisition of this album, GEH held only four photographs by or of Andy Warhol. Barnes wrote: "Given the deadline on acceptance of the gift, I am requesting that an e-vote by the Photograph Collections Committee to approve acceptance of this gift."2 As such, the Foundation's valuable gift found its place amongst the extensive Department of Photography's collection of photographs. The album GEH acquired includes 447 photographs taken between 1969 and 1974. A majority of the portraits were captured on SX-70 and Polacolor 108 type films, with only a few black and white prints made with type 107 film.

This applied thesis was undertaken in accordance with the terms prescribed by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts as listed in the document accompanying the donation: the work must be stored and displayed according to museum standards, and must be accessible for scholarly purposes. This project's primary goals are to provide access to this valuable album of photographs through cataloguing and to preserve its integrity by providing suitable housing for the object. To achieve an exhaustive understanding of the Andy Warhol Family Album, I carefully examined it, and thoroughly catalogued it in the museum's collection management system: The Museum System (TMS). With the aid of Barbara Galasso, official museum photographer for George Eastman House, every print included in the album was photographed and annotated. To follow, since the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts had already carefully conserved the album, I created a preservative enclosure to protect and assure its conformity with the other valuable albums in the collection.3 These steps will be expended upon in the following chapters. Finally, in fulfillment of the requirements for completion of the Masters of Arts in Photographic Preservation and Collection Management, this paper was drafted to provide concise information on preservation of Polaroid material and to highlight the importance of instant photography in Andy Warhol's art practice

Chapter I: Literature Review 1.1 Photography in Andy Warhol's work

While the book Andy Warhol edited by Annette Michelson includes critical analysis of the artist's body of work, none of the essays comprised within look at his photographic work in depth. Buchloh's essay "Andy Warhol's One-Dimensional Art:1956-1966" (1989) examines the dialectic between high art and mass culture in Warhol's iconic paintings. Although it only focuses on an earlier period of his career, it sheds light on the critical aspects of the paintings that inspired Warhol's commissioned portraits of the 1970s and 1980s. Andy Warhol (1970) with contributions from John Coplans, Jonas Mekas and Calvin Tomkins, gives insight into the life of Warhol from his beginnings to around the time the Family Albums were compiled. None of the three essays speak of his photographic work, but they offer glimpses of who Andy Warhol was at the time. Similarly, Stephen Koch's preface in Andy Warhol: Photographs looks at the iconization that occurs in the artist's work, the replications characteristic to his style, and the dehumanization that happens to the subject of his paintings and photographs. Andy Warhol Photography (1999) is a tremendously rich resource on Warhol's use of photography in his art practice. Heinrich's, Derenthal's and Fremont's essay are particularly interesting in regards to instant photography in his oeuvre. Derenthal's "Andy Warhol, Photographic Tradition and Zeitgeist" establishes the artist's photographic work within the history of photography as fine art, while also recognizing the value of the thousands of photographs in his estate. "Sometimes around 1970, Andy Warhol Bought a Polaroid Big Shot Camera" is an account of the portrait sessions that took place at The Factory. It is directly related

  

3  

to the content of the Family Albums donated to six American museums, including George Eastman House. Christoph Heinrich covers many aspects of Warhol's photography in "Andy Warhol. Art Director ­ Amateur ­ Artist." He explains how photography became a central characteristic of his practice, through sections highlighting aesthetics, machine-like methods, social aspects of photography, and photography as an economic mean to art production.

1.2 On Dye Diffusion Prints:

The Polaroid Corporation published "Storing, Handling and Preserving Polaroid Photographs: A Guide" in 1983. The guide presents recommendations on storage and display of Polaroid material. It also provides information on the restoration of prints and reversible preservation methods that can be used to extend the life of Polaroid prints. "The Preservation of Polaroids" (2012) written by Victoria Ostrzenski for the University of British Columbia is a very good concise reference to anyone wanting information on the preservation of Polaroid prints. Ostrzenski describes the two film types discussed in this thesis project, but does not go into much details. It covers the different deteriorations that can affect the prints, and gives storage and handling guidelines. This source summarizes efficiently the characteristics of Polaroid films and the issues faced by conservators and archivists dealing with them. Sylvie Pernichon's chapter "Dye Diffusion Processes" in Twentieth-Century Color Photographs, Identification and Care (2013) discuses thoroughly the diverse preservation aspects that concern dye diffusion prints. The author explains in a comprehensible voice the general chemistry behind these prints, common deteriorations that can affect them, as well as

  

4  

handling and storage guidelines. This chapter also discusses other types of dye diffusion prints that can be found in collections, but do not concern this thesis project. Twentieth-Century Color Photographs, Identification and Care (2013) is an up-to-date book that covers the scope of this particular photographic material. Henry Wilhelm is an incontestable source when one researches preservation issues regarding photographic color material. "Dark Fading and Yellowish Staining of Color Prints, Transparencies, and Negatives" in The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs (2013 edition) was accessed online to complement Pernichon's book. Wilhelm's writing tends to be more technical, and presents his own scientific findings in graphics and detailed explanations. This chapter focuses more on the stability of newer film types, but still offers insight on the stability of SX-70 film. I looked at older sources to find out more about the first Polacolor film type and found some information in "Monitoring the Fading and Staining of Color Photographic Prints" from the same author. This article was published in 1981 in Journal of the American Institute for Conservation. Only section 9 mentioned the film. Also written in 1981, Martin Idelsen's essay "SX-70: A unique system of dyes" explains how the dye diffusion process functions within SX-70 prints. It describes the chemical compositions and characteristic of the dyes used in early Polacolor 1 and SX-70, as well as their improved subsequent versions. 1.3 On Preservation of Albums Gustavo Lazano's "History and Conservation of Albums and Photographically Illustrated Books" examines the differences between photograph albums and photographically illustrated books. It does not cover the decades following the 1930s because it claims that albums and

  

5  

books created after this time have not yet reached museum collections and archives. Nonetheless, its examination of the challenges experienced by the conservation community when faced to these object reveals that value, function and use are important assessments to research while determining the scope of conservation projects. Environment control, physical storage, treatment and reformatting of photograph albums and scrapbooks are discussed in "Preservation of Scrapbooks and Albums," a Library of Congress publication. It presents guidelines and recommendations that will help to prolong the useful life of the objects if followed. In the same manner, Sherelyn Ogden's paper "Preservation Options for Scrapbook and Album Formats," addresses the inherent problems and causes of deterioration of albums and scrapbooks. It introduces elements to consider, like value, use, condition and cost, when preparing a conservation proposal.

Chapter II. Andy Warhol's Family Album at George Eastman House 2.1 The Acquisition:

From the donation agreement signed in September 2013, to the album's delivery, quite some time passed. Jamie Allen, assistant curator, communicated with the Foundation at the end of October to follow up on the album's estimated shipping date. She was informed that all the gifted albums were being scanned and would not be shipped to their new collections prior to December.4 The Andy Warhol Family Album arrived at George Eastman House in February 2014. The album came protected in a rigid cardboard box. Additionally, it was housed in a black reinforced cardboard suitcase. The suitcase's archival proprieties were questionable. I consulted with Ross Knapper, assistant collection manager, and assistant curator Jessica Johnston in order to determine if I should consider it as an integral part of the object or rather focus solely on the album. Samo Gale, licensing associate at the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, confirmed that the black suitcase was a temporary enclosure to ensure the safe travel of the album from the Foundation to George Eastman House.

2.2 Physical Description:

The Andy Warhol Family Album is a red leatherette post-bound album. It measures 31.9 centimeters high, 33.2 centimeters wide, and is 5.9 centimeters thick. The front cover is detached from the spine due to handling wear, but it is otherwise in acceptable condition.

posts holding the pages together are somewhat loose, but sturdy. Their looseness offers better flexibility to the spine of the album as the pages turn. There are 94 pages accommodating 447 Polaroid prints of various types,5 which will be discussed in a later chapter. They are formatted to house six 4x6 photographs per side; eight of these pages are empty. Also, some slots hold more than one print, even up to four per slot. The sixth slot on page 47 holds two prints of the same subject, the second slot on page 76 holds four prints, on page 86, two Polaroid's are inserted in the second slot, and finally, the last slot on page 94 end the album with three different types of Polaroid prints. A few empty slots can be observed throughout the album.

On page 84, the second slot is empty but a Post-It inscribed " .373 is followed by .386" is glued on top of it. The numbers on this note refer to the numbering system used by The Andy Warhol Foundation. In fact, F311.00373 does precede the note, but F311.00386 does not follow it, nor do the two prints bare consecutive print number or the same manufacturing code6 (both

show a manufacturer's stamp on the back --The Polaroid Corporation), nor is it of the same sitter. I have contacted the Foundation in regards to the Post-It, and it seems that it should not have been there when we received it, that it had served the Foundation while they inventoried the album's content, and should have been discarded at that time. I resolved the issue by finally removing it in good conscience. I have also observed a discrepancy in the sequence of the photographs within the album. The Foundation numbered the prints in ascending order, as they had been assembled in the album. But following F311.00339, the sequence is disrupted by the insertion of prints number F311.00437 to F311.00447. The ascending sequence continues regularly afterwards. Ms. Gale assured me that the numerical sequence was in fact the same order as the album was laid out at the time of Andy Warhol's death. The Holson Company produced the original photograph album Warhol used to organize his Polaroid prints. The company was a leading manufacturer of photograph albums, and marketed its product principally in mass-merchandise chains across the United States. After a 1989 merger, the company was renamed Holson Burnes Group, Inc.7 It is still in operation today.

Chapter III. Methodology

This chapter will cover the steps I took to meet the objectives I had set for this thesis. I divided it further into two sub-sections that will address the preservation and housing portion of the applied project, and the cataloguing portion that was carried out subsequently. Before I undertook the project, since the album had not yet arrived at George Eastman House, I used a detailed list of sitters provided by the Foundation to figure out how many identified subjects needed biographies entered into TMS. There are 105 individuals portrayed in the album. I then proceeded to conduct preliminary research on them in order to compile a comprehensive list of names, date of births and deaths, and occupations.8 Some of these sitters are relatively unknown and their constituent records could only be minimally updated. For some others, research was inconclusive and only their names are known. The following steps were completed after Andy Warhol's Family Album arrived at the museum in February.

3.1 Housing

When the gift from the Foundation arrived, curatorial assistant Will Green and I carefully opened the package and examined the object to make sure no damage was sustained during transportation. I took the album's measurements at that time in order to plan the proper housing. Early in March I set up an appointment with Ross Knapper to look at diverse housing of albums in the collection at George Eastman House. Since Andy Warhol's Family album has a detached cover and a loose sheet of paper about the Holson company, I contemplated making a separate

enclosure for these two parts that would be stored together with the album within a second enclosure.9 Ultimately, I decided to custom make a Mylar sleeve for the Holson paper sheet, and not to isolate the front cover from the album. In order to protect the front cover from slipping out while the album is being taken out of its enclosure, I added a fold-over flap to the protective wrap (photograph). The wrap was constructed out of acid-free 2-ply mat board. I measured the album in its wrap to ensure a snug fit of the four flap enclosure that houses the object. Considering the heaviness of the album, I determined that a linen cord attached to the left hand side and to the right flap would be the best option to tie the enclosure (photograph). These decisions ensured that the album would not be handled awkwardly and that handling damage would be prevented. I adopted Sherelyn Ogden's list of considerations in the development of a treatment proposal for scrapbooks and albums.10 Since the album is highly valuable, culturally and monetarily, I protected it further in a custom made box.11

vault. Even if the costs of making this box surpass those of a pre-made conservation storage, it was an obvious choice because of the album's value.

3.2 Cataloging

This part of the project was split in four. Upon receiving the gift, the Registrar's office assigned it an acquisition number: 2013:0302:0001-0447 and entered the album's title to the lot record. The album is one lot, encompassing 447 items. Before dividing the lot further more into items, I entered the data that occurred most often amongst the photographs, such as original photographer, medium, measurements, and cataloguer information. The second step was spent in the print room with the album, cataloguing inscriptions on the back of each Polaroid prints. It was important to be extra careful while sliding the prints out of their plastic slots as to not scratch their surface. Nitrile gloves were mandatory. During this process, I observed a discrepancy in the numbering sequence established by the Foundation. Each Polaroid print had been assigned a number increasing from F311.00001 to F311.00447. When I reached F311.00339, the sequence broke and the next prints were numbered F311.00437 to F311.00447. The regular order picked up after. I have contacted the Foundation to obtain clarifications on what might have happened. Either this physical arrangement was Warhol's original edits and they had mistakenly numbered them, either the Foundation had replaced them after replacing the original plastic pages.12 At the time I decided to keep the present sequence intact and temporarily assume our own numbering was going to match the Foundations, until I heard back from them. Once I received confirmation from Samo Gale that the discrepancy had

Taina Meller informed me that conservative work had been performed on the album, the replacement of the pages to archival quality polyester pages explicitly.

  

12  

been caused by the scanning specialist the Foundation had hired prior to sending out the albums to their institutions, the physical order of the prints ought to be rectified to reflect its intended order. In order to rectify this issue, the polyester page was repositioned at the end of the album. Barbara Galasso and I took three days to photograph each print and spreads in the album. After I numbered the prints according to George Eastman House requirements, neatly in pencil, from 2013:0302:0001 to 2013:0302:0447, she photographed them one at a time. Meanwhile, I numbered the files on the computer. The photographs were then added to The Museum System in the media parameter corresponding to their own entry. This photographic documentation of the items, and importation into the database, is an important part of this project as it minimizes physical handling of the object and is in agreement to Ogden's proposed preservation solutions.13

Figure 3: Example of a page spread in the album.

The fourth and last part of cataloguing consisted of adding in the rest of the information that had been cumulated in TMS. At this point, I entered titles, title types, dates, and constituents. I referred to George Eastman House TMS style manual to ensure conformity to the existing

records.14 This style manual is under constant revision, but it nonetheless offered a clear guide to cataloguing collection items. In the case of Andy Warhol's Family Album, since The Foundation provided an informative lists of sitters, dates and film types, the subject of the photograph's name was used as an authorized title with the remark "Title provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts." The style manual states: Authorized title is used for those objects where a photographer or photographer's estate has assigned a title to an image, or when paperwork that accompanies the work at time of acquisition notes a specific title. When using authorized title, an explanation of the authorization should be added to the remarks field in the title assistant.15 In this case, the second applies. Some of the names had been misspelled on the document provided by the Foundation. They have been corrected in the title and a note has been added in the remarks section to refer to the spelling used by the Foundation. The album title is displayed second after the authorized title as shown in this example: (screen cap of record). Some of Warhol's sitters are unknown and the Foundation listed them as unidentified men and women. Unidentified men or women is usually not an accepted title in the Department of Photography, but due to the nature of the object, I decided to keep it as an authorized title. A note regarding the content of the photograph was added in the description section of the record to complement the non-descriptive title. I researched the sitter's names within the constituent database on TMS to make sure I was not duplicating pre-existing records. I noticed that twelve individuals already had multiple records. With the help of Jamie Allen I selected the most complete record for each of them and attached it to the items they are associated with in the Family Album. Lastly, I updated the biographical data for the constituents for whom information could be obtained.

Chapter IV. Instant Photography and Andy Warhol

When Polaroid released the Big Shot16 camera in 1971, Andy Warhol found the perfect tool to enable his production of a growing number of commissioned portraits. This simple plastic camera was created expressly for portrait photography. It had a fixed single element lens that came in focus only at a three feet distance. Warhol, as well as other users, would swiftly move back-and-forth to bring the subject into focus. This focusing maneuver was sometimes referred to as the "Big Shot Shuffle."17 The clunky camera allowed for the use of a flashcube positioned on top of the lens. Warhol particularly favored this lighting because it flattened the subject's features,18 much like the photobooth did.19 When the Big Shot was discontinued in 1973, Warhol searched the neighborhood around the Factory to purchase remaining stock of the camera. Upon learning how much Andy Warhol loved that particular camera, Polaroid offered to repair and maintain his Big Shots.20 Vincent Fremont details the unfolding of a typical commissioned portrait session. The women subjects were directed to pose in a way that would exude both sensuality and youth, and men were urged to show charisma and intelligence. The women sitters would undergo dramatic makeup to blur the little imperfections that could undermine the iconic and timeless beauty that Andy Warhol wanted to depict. The limited focal length forced Warhol to shoot head and shoulders portraits of his subjects.

camera were high contrast images that were ideal for reproduction onto silkscreens. According to Fremont, these scheduled shoots would always follow a lunch where the sitter would get acquainted with Andy Warhol and other friends of his, turning the whole affair into an event. From sometimes hundreds of photographs captured during the sitting, Warhol, the model and bystanders, selected a handful.21 The selected portraits served as sketches for the commissioned painting that would follow. These commissioned portraits produced over two decades immortalized everyone who sat for them in a way only Warhol could accomplish: fixing the sitter's fifteen minutes of fame onto canvas, while conferring it a sense of vibrancy and timelessness. While about half of the photographs included in Andy Warhol's Family Album held at George Eastman house are products of these aforementioned sittings, the other half are SX-70 snapshots of the American art scene of the seventies. Warhol turned his lens to the beautiful people that he surrounded himself with. From partygoers to rich gallery owners, everyone was photographed with the same photographic material. Before his acquisition of a Minox 35 EI in 1976,22 the more portable SX-70 Polaroid camera, which was released in 1972, was Andy Warhol's event companion. He could snap pictures speedily, jumping from one person to the next. These snapshots document the life swirling around him at the time and offer a contrasting, if not complementing, perspective on his use of Polaroid photography when juxtaposed to his stylistic portrait sessions.

Chapter V. Polaroid Film Types: Characteristics and Preservation Issues

As is stated in the chapter that discusses the album's physical description, the prints included in the album are of two formats, and the vast majority were photographed on type 108 and SX-70. Only four prints were shot on black and white type 107 film. Nonetheless, these film types can be divided into two distinct categories, namely, integral and peel-apart film. This chapter will outline the principal characteristics of each of these film types, and offer preservation guidelines that should be followed to prolong the life of these fragile materials. Please refer to the literature outlined in this thesis' literature review for detailed conservative procedures and chemical makeup of these materials.

5.1 Peel-apart: Polacolor 1

Commercialized in 1963, Polacolor followed the introduction of instant black and white film on the market. Unlike its predecessor, Polacolor did not require coating to stabilize the image. It was widely successful.23 This type of Polaroid film contained three parts: the negative, the receiving sheet onto which the positive will adhere, and the chemical reagent-holding pod. The negative consisted of many layers of dyes and sensitized silver halide emulsion layers. Once exposed, the film package was pulled through rollers. The pod was ruptured and the reagent reacted with the multiple layers of the negative. The dyes migrated to the image-receiving layer

for about a minute at room temperature. After the sixty seconds, the negative and the final positive image were separated.24

5.2 Integral: SX-70

Introduced in 1972, the SX-70 camera was truly novel. The compatible film manufactured for it shared the same name. The components of this film were encompassed within a single object characterized by its now-famous white borders. The film package was comprised of fifteen layers, nine of which formed the negative part. Similar to the peel-apart film type, a reagent-holding pod was ruptured as it was expelled from the camera, and the alkali reagent would spread and activate all the layers. The chemical reaction that followed enabled the diffusion of dyes towards the image-receiving layer where the positive appeared.25

5.3 Preservation of Polaroid Film Dye diffusion prints are susceptible to light exposure and it is recommended they not be exposed to illumination levels higher than 50 lux, for an annual exposure up to 12,000 luxhours.26 If allowed by The Foundation, a good alternative for George Eastman House would be to exhibit surrogates of the prints when complying with Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts' requirements. Instant prints are stable in dark storage. SX-70 prints will however develop a yellowish stain over a short period of time.27 Henry Wilhelm also states: "The original Polaroid Polacolor film (now referred to as Polacolor 1) introduced in 1963 (...) characteristically exhibit

very good dark-storage stability and do not have the minimum-density stain problems associated with the later Polacolor 2 and Polacolor ER prints."28 Aside from light and dark fading and stain formation, high and low humidity levels are also damaging to dye diffusion prints. It is best to keep them at a constant relative humidity of 30-50%. Freezing is not recommended for these materials; instead, they should be stored at temperatures between 16-21oC.29 Common deteriorations that dye diffusion prints may exhibit are cracking of the imagereceiving layer (in pre-1976 SX-70) and formation of minuscule white pigment aggregations beneath the polyester protective layer of integral prints made in the seventies.30 Fluctuating humidity levels impact integral prints and often results in image layer cracking. Peel-apart and integral films are susceptible to mishandling and careful manipulation of the objects should be prioritized. Storage of these materials should meet archival standards. Any housing material coming in direct contact with the prints should have a pH of 7.0 to 8.5.31 The polyester sleeves in which the Andy Warhol Polaroid's have been rehoused comply to this standard, as does the second enclosure created for this project. The polyester sleeves also aid in reducing possible handling mishaps while allowing viewers to observe the prints.

Conclusion: The Andy Warhol Family Album is a remarkable acquisition for George Eastman House. The album extends the collection to encompass photographic works of twentieth century painters. As such, it leads the way to future acquisitions of this sort, following a mandate for such acquisitions established by the museums director, Bruce Barnes. The completed catalogue records and this thesis offer researchers a helpful starting point for the study of Warhol's revered portraits of the seventies. I observed that some of the portraits included within the album have served as sketches for commissioned paintings that are part of private collections, such as The John and Kimiko Powers Collection. I feel that the study and comparison of all six albums would further understanding of Andy Warhol's method and work process and better situate the role of Polaroid and instant photography in the history of Art. The protective housing and monitored environment in which the album is stored will prolong the life of this invaluable object for generations of scholars and museum visitors.
