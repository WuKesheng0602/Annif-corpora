Abstract
A COMPARISON OF THE NFRC AND CEN THERMAL TRANSMITTANCE CALCULATION METHODS USING DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN NORTH AMERICA'S EIGHT CLIMATE ZONES

Master of Applied Science, 2014 Peta-Gaye M. Ebanks Building Science Ryerson University

Studies have found that the CEN and NFRC methods produce different U-values for the same window. A comparative evaluation of the NFRC and CEN U-value calculation methods was conducted for North American residential high performance window products, as well as several parameters that are most influential in determining the whole window U-value for high performance windows, when utilizing different assumptions and boundary conditions, in North America's eight climate zones. Using 2-D simulation software, THERM and WINDOW, four North American high performance frame types with double, triple and quad glazing combinations, were simulated and calculated according to the NFRC and CEN standard methods. Overall, the trend showed that for the specific window combinations of this study, the higher the performance of the IGU, the lesser the differences in the whole window U-value of both methods. Several strategies were proposed to support the possibility of the harmonization of both calculation methods.

1 Introduction
The figurative and historical significance of windows presents a striking opportunity for architects, engineers, builders, manufacturers and homeowners, to challenge themselves in the design process by considering the potential impact of their design decisions on people. A window's thermal performance, size, orientation, visible light transmittance and solar gain, are factors that all need to be considered in creating a home because they influence people's health, well-being, and energy consumption. The residential building sector has opportunities to minimize its cumulative impact on energy consumption in Canada. In 2009, the residential sector was the third largest consumer of energy in Canada, consuming 17% of the total energy used and producing 15% of total greenhouse gas emission production (Natural Resources Canada, 2012). In the U.S., residential and commercial buildings consume 40% of primary energy consumption; residential buildings comprise 21% of that total (U.S. Department of Energy, 2011). In Canada, space heating comprised the largest portion of residential energy use, consuming 63% (Natural Resources Canada, 2012). In a typical home, 30-50% of the energy used is transmitted through the windows; thus, 30-50% of the energy that is derived from fossil fuels and nuclear power is transmitted through windows and not conserved (Gustavsen, Grynning, Arasteh, Petter Jelle, & Goudey, 2011). Windows thus account for the majority of heat loss within a building (Gustavsen, Arasteh, Petter Jelle, & Curcija, 2008) and affects the energy used for heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation (U.S. Department of Energy, 2011). Window frames account for 20 to 30% of the whole window area yet can be responsible for more than 30% of the rate of heat transfer (Gustavsen, Arasteh, Petter Jelle, & Curcija, 2008). The rate of heat transfer through the frames can be much greater for high performance (low conductance) windows. Considering that Canada is the third largest energy consumer per capita in the world (The World Bank, 2013), followed by the U.S., a reduction in energy consumption through the use of high performance windows would have a significant effect on reducing our cumulative environmental impact, particularly pollutants that exacerbate climate change, for the benefit of present and future generations. The essential part of this research focuses on how the rate of heat transfer, or thermal transmittance, is calculated and measured for windows The way in which the technicalities are dealt with, in the thermal transmittance calculations and measurements, are integral to determining and defining what actually makes a window high-performing. Seeing that these technicalities are dealt with differently internationally, a number of complexities have emerged over the years and continue to be addressed by 1

the International Standard Organization (ISO). Presently, it is difficult to compare different window products between Europe and North America because the overall U- values are calculated differently and not all of the parameters used are the same. The majority of North American window manufacturers use the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) [Ducker Research Company, 2012] calculation method for determining the overall U-value of their window products and Europe manufacturers use the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) [Sack, 2013] method. Throughout the literature, it is evident that there is a significant discrepancy between the NFRC and the CEN methods in determining the overall window U-value as to which is more accurate. As stated by the Passive House Institute U.S. (PHIUS), "there is a longstanding disagreement between the CEN and NFRC methods" (Wright, 2012). In fact, for the same window, studies have found that the CEN and NFRC methods produce different U-values. This has created confusion amongst window manufacturers, builders, building scientists, energy modellers, architects and home owners (Wright, 2012). In terms of the type of energy performance metrics used and how these metrics are calculated, these aspects are integral in giving equal metrics to contribute to adequately informed decision making decisions in the design phase of any building process and to compare window products on the same level of energy performance metrics and methods.

1.1 Research Focus and Objectives
The focus of this study is to conduct a comparative evaluation of the NFRC and CEN U-value calculation methods for North American residential high performance window products and to evaluate the parameters that are most influential in determining the whole window U-value for high performance windows when utilizing different assumptions and boundary conditions in North America's climate zones. The objectives of this research are to: 1. What are the differences between the NFRC and CEN calculation methods for determining the Uvalue for window products? 2. What parameters can be harmonized between the two methods? 2.1. Where there are no differences, what parameters can be omitted? 3. How are these parameters affected by the different boundary conditions in North America's eight climate zones?

1.2 Background
According to CANMET Energy (2010), windows alone were deemed as the largest thermal loss attributed to space heating in a typical new house, representing 27% of annual space heating needs (Parekh, 2010). In the United States, Apte and Arasteh (2006) estimate that windows alone contribute to 29% of the energy used for overall residential space conditioning; more specifically, windows comprise 24% of residential heating energy use (only 3% less than in Canada) and 42% of cooling energy use. A Norwegian study compared the thermal transmittance values (U-values) of windows with those of the wall, roof and floor constructions. This study found that windows typically account for about 30Â­50% of the total transmission heat loss through the building envelope (Gustavsen et al., 2011). Following the laws of thermodynamics and in particular, Fourier's law of conduction, heat follows the path of least resistance and seeing that windows have a higher thermal transmittance than the wall, roof and floor, 0.7-1.0 W/m2K compared to 0.1 and 0.2 W/m2K, heat is readily transmitted through the window (Gustavsen et al., 2011). Taking into account the thermal transmittance of the windows, they can significantly lower the overall thermal transmittance of an elevation. Since windows are the largest source of heat loss within a building, the use of high insulating windows is thus integral to conserving heating and cooling energy. There is thus a great need for the incorporation of higher insulating windows as part of a high performing building envelope in the residential sector. High performance windows are generally defined as windows that resist condensation, provide thermal comfort, and impede the flow of heat between the indoor and outdoor environments more efficiently than the majority of the windows available in the market; such as single-pane or double-pane (3.12 and 2.73 W/m2K), air-filled windows with non-insulated frames (ASHRAE, 2009). In Ontario, the building code requires that residential windows have a maximum U-value of 2 W/ m2K as detailed by the energy efficiency compliance packages (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2006). Energy Star windows in Canada require a maximum value of 1.6, 1.4 and 1.2 W/ m2K in climate zones 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Rogers, 2014). In Denmark, an `energy efficient sealed unit' is defined as a double glazed unit with one low emissivity glass with a U-value of less than 1.8 W/m2K; which is considered to be a high U-value for a Nordic country (Avasoo, 2007). In Sweden, energy efficient windows are rated from 1.5 to 0.9 W/m2K or less (Avasoo, 2007). Currently the highest performing glazing (including translucent aerogel products) have approximate Uvalues of 0.3Â­0.5 W/m2Â·K (Gustavsen et al., 2011). The highest performing window frames currently have approximate U-values of 0.6Â­0.8 W/m2K (Gustavsen et al., 2011). To achieve a U-value of approximately 0.5 W/m2K, there typically needs to be three panes with krypton or xenon gas fill, two or 3

more layers of low-E coating and insulated spacers (Gustavsen et al., 2011). For this research, based on ASHRAE's typical North American residential window U-values, the Efficient Windows Collaborative and PHI's recommended glazing for various climatic regions, the definition of a high performance window for a cold climate contains double panes, argon gas infill, low-E coating(s), insulated spacers and an insulated non-metal frame with a maximum U-value of 1.25 W/m2K (Passivhaus Institut, 2012) (ASHRAE, 2009) (Efficient Windows Collaborative, 2012). For the warmer climatic regions of North America, a high performance window contains at least two panes, argon gas infill, a low-E coating, solar control coatings, insulated spacers and an insulated non-metal frame with a maximum U-value of 1.70 (Passivhaus Institut, 2012; ASHRAE, 2009; Efficient Windows Collaborative, 2012).

Currently, however, in North America, high performance windows are minimally used. Rather, the most common residential window being used is the double-glazed vinyl framed window (Hopwood, 2013). In Canada, 54% of window frames were made of vinyl, 39% wood and wood-clad, 6% aluminum and 1% was made of other materials (Parekh, 2010). In the U.S., vinyl accounts for 67.9% or two thirds of the residential market, wood-framed windows follow comprising approximately 20%; aluminum and other materials such as fiberglass and composites (including insulated PVC) cover the least portion of the market with roughly 5-6% each (Ducker Research Company, 2012). Seeing that the metrics for thermal performance are integral in determining what defines a high performance window, the calculation methods that these metrics are derived from are very significant. Since the U-values of North American and European window products are being calculated differently, there are numerous impacts on the building industry. North American window manufacturers are particularly interested in this debate for they are adversely affected by the difference in stated U-values for window products, depending on the calculation method used, considering that builders of high performance homes tend to choose windows with the lowest U-value (Hanam, 2013). For a typical window, because the NFRC method tends to give a higher U-value, builders tend to choose European windows rather than North American windows (Hanam, 2013). How can products be compared appropriately if the performance values are not calculated in the same way? Energy modellers may be inputting numbers without the understanding of where they come from and not understanding or realizing that the numbers are not necessarily correct or appropriate for a specific climate zone. Generally speaking, NFRC testing methods generally give a specific window an approximation of 10% more heat flow than the value derived from tests according to European standards (Straube J. , 2009) (Rosenbaum & White, 2009). Arestah et al. (2001) found that for a typical vinyl window frame, the 4

frame U-value differs by =/-10% between the interpretations of the NFRC and CEN method. However, according to the literature, the differences between the calculations depend upon various assumptions and boundary conditions and when looking at high performance windows, the results do not align with the generalized assumption of 10% (Hanam, 2013). In addition to the U-value, there is more thermal transmittance, or thermal bridges, that occur at the junctions of materials. Since windows are "held structurally in the building [envelope], windows almost always involve thermal bridges" (Hutcheon & Handegord, 1995). A performance metric that measures potential thermal bridges is the Linear Thermal Bridge Coefficient or -value. The -value is described as the additional linear thermal transmittance, which is the additional heat loss that is transmitted through the junctions between different materials; it is the additional transfer of heat that occurs between and through the different materials that are conjoined in an area.  values are used by European window manufacturers who abide by standards set by the International Standard Organization (ISO) and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). European Passive House window manufacturers use the CEN /ISO linear method (EN 673/ISO 10077) for calculating various detailed thermal values for a window that includes: total solar energy transmittance, -value, U-value of the frame, - value of the spacer, and center-of-glazing U-value. Generally in the building industry in North America, there is a lack of information about the -values of different window types and the ways in which to use this parameter in measuring potential thermal bridging that is already widely used in Europe. Manufacturers are not required to calculate -values; the main energy performance ratings that are voluntarily reported on the NFRC label are U- values and SHGC values (Ducker Research Company, 2012) (NFRC, 2012). -values are voluntarily given only by a few individual window manufacturers that choose to include them in their technical specifications. Maximum  values are not required by any building codes, thus, unless a builder is determined to calculate the potential thermal bridge losses for an individual project, there is otherwise a lack of incentive to do so since this parameter is not required by code. Currently, energy performance testing of windows is not mandatory in all of Canada; it is only required in some provinces such as Ontario, British Columbia, Yukon and Nova Scotia (NRC, 2012) and for windows exported to the United States. The NAFS (North American Fenestration Standard), in conjunction with the Canadian Standards Association's standard A440S1-09, are currently replacing older Canadian standards in order to harmonize the Canadian and American performance standards (NRC, 2012) (Rogers, 2014). These standards specify minimum performance ratings for the U-value, 5

wind load resistance, air tightness and water tightness (Canadian Standards Association, 2009). The Uvalues that are used in the energy performance ratings, specified by these standards, are calculated according to the NFRC U-value calculation method (Canadian Standards Association, 2009). Thus, the Uvalue calculation method is integral to establishing the energy performance ratings for national window standards and for setting energy efficiency targets as outlined, for example, in Ontario's supplementary standard SB-12 (Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, 2006). There is a lack of information in the literature as to the nature of the thermal transmittance of a window, the overall U-value and  value, and changes according to different boundary conditions within the climate zones in North America. According to the IECC and ASHRAE, there are eight climate zones for North America; four of these are in Canada. A comparative evaluation of the differences between the NFRC and CEN methods of calculating the overall U-values and -values and how these values change for high performance windows when applying different assumptions and boundary conditions, were explored in the research using the IECC's eight climate zone specifications. Furthermore, the possible harmonization of both methods will be postulated.

1.3 Research Contribution
By highlighting the parameters and assumptions that affect the overall U-value in the eight climate zones in North America, window design can be tailored to achieve high thermal performance in climate specific areas. Drawing comparisons of the NFRC and CEN U-value calculation methods using different boundary conditions can enhance the current research specific to North America. Evaluating the value can help measure the magnitude of the potential for thermal bridging in various window frames in the eight climate zones. This research is relevant for the North American window manufacturers, building scientists, architects, engineers, energy modellers, and builders of high performance homes.

2 Literature Review
North American contributions to the window industry have been extremely significant, seeing that it was a North American inventor that profoundly changed the window industry with the beginnings of a high performance design. An American patent solicitor and expert, Thomas Stetson patented the first insulating glass unit in 1865 (see Figure 1) (Stetson, 1865). It consisted of two panes of glass tightly joined at their edges, nailed or tacked to the sash; the panes were kept separated by a strip of wood or string (Stetson, 1865). The first spacer was made of wood or string. Putty, made of whiting (finely ground chalk) and oil (linseed), or other material, was placed along the edges in between the panes in order to provide a seal and bind them together (Stetson, 1865). Today, innovation in window design continues to be a very lucrative area for window manufacturers to focus upon as the demand for high performance glazing grows with the demand for high performance buildings.

Figure 1 First Insulated Glazing Unit by Thomas Stetson (Lingnell, 2011)

2.1 Thermal Transmittance Challenges
The U- value or thermal transmittance through the frame and glazing depends upon the configuration and properties of the glazing system materials; i.e. thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, vapour pressure etc. The thermal transmittance is typically lower in the glazing than the frame due to the material and gas properties. In the past, the thermal transmittance of the center-of-glass area (see Figure 2), was used by window manufacturers to describe the energy performance of the whole window product (Canadian Standards Association, 2009). The Ucog area does not take into account for the area where the thermal bridging effects of the interaction of the frame and sash materials and thus gave energy performance values that were overstated in the past when single or double glazing was used (Canadian Standards Association, 2009). These values were thus also misleading for builders that installed these windows who were lead to believe that they were using a certain U- value when in fact the overall U- value was 7

much less after installation when factoring in the different thermal transmittance values of the window components and their effect on the whole window thermal transmittance.

Figure 2 Window Product Diagram (NFRC, 2010)

What compounds the complexity of this situation is that not only do various component details possess different U- values, the calculation methods used to determine whole window product U-values, (Uwindow), in North America and Europe have significant differences. Straube identifies that for a specific window, NFRC testing methods generally give an approximation of 10% more heat flow than the value derived from tests according to European standards (Straube J. , 2009) (Rosenbaum & White, 2009) (Varshneya, Rosaa, & Shapiroa, 2012). However, according to the literature, when specific windows are evaluated, the results do not congrue with the generalized assumption of 10%. In a comparative study of three double-glazed windows, (vinyl, fiberglass and certified PH), Uwindow-NFRC was typically 5-7% higher than Uwindow-CEN (Hanam, 2013). For triple-glazed windows, the differences were smaller (Hanam, 2013). When high and low solar heat gain glazing were compared, there was a 12% different between the NFRC and CEN solar heat gain coefficients for the low solar heat gain glazing and only a 1% difference for the high solar heat gain glazing (Hanam, 2013). This difference was attributed to the different values for the instant solar radiation in both methods (Hanam, 2013). 8

These numerous differences have spurred a long standing debate leaving more questions as to which thermal transmittance calculation is more accurate and what parameters in the boundary conditions are the most influential and how do these parameters affect the overall thermal transmittance of a window.

2.2 The NFRC Thermal Transmittance Calculation Method
The NFRC created a windows ratings system that is currently used by the majority of window manufacturers in Canada and the US. These ratings give performance metrics whereby window products can be compared with each other on the same level with specific metrics. The NFRC product labels primarily give whole product energy performance ratings, specifically the U- value, solar heat gain coefficient, and visible transmittance. Additionally the labels may include air leakage and condensation resistance. The U- value of a window is derived from the material properties of the different component materials that constitute the glazing, the frame and spacer (Section 5.2, NFRC 100). According to section 4.3 of NFRC 100-2010[E0A7] Procedure for Determining Fenestration Product Uvalues, the overall U- value is calculated only according to the area Â­weighted method outlined in ISO 15099 Section 4.1.3; a specific model size is used [see Table 7]. From the initial draft of an ASHRAE standard in the 1990s (by ASHRAE Special Project Committee 142), then further developed by the ISO with contributions from the CEN member nations, thermal transmittance calculation methods were established in the standard ISO 15099 (ASHRAE, 1998) (Blanusa, et al., 2007). "This standard includes both the one-dimensional thermal calculation methodologies used in the WINDOW (LBNL, 1994) and VISION (Wright J. , 1995) programs and in ISO 10077-1 (ISO, 2000) and the two-dimensional frame/spacer heat transfer calculation methodologies used in the FRAME (EEL, 1995) and THERM (LBNL, 1998) programs and in ISO 10077-2 (ISO, 2012) (Blanusa, et al., 2007)." In this method, the frame, divider, edge-of-divider, edge-of-glazing and center-of-glazing U- values are multiplied by their associated areas and summed altogether. This summed value is then divided by the projected fenestration project area to give the total fenestration product U-value, as seen in Equation 1:
    

(1)

Where: Uw-NFRC = Whole Window U- value Apf = Projected Fenestration Product Area Uframe = Frame U- value 9 Uedge = Edge-of-Glazing U- value Aedge = Edge-of-Glazing Area Ude = Edge-of-Divider U- value

Aframe = Frame Area Ud = Divider U- value Ad = Divider Area

Ade = Edge-of-Divider Area Ucog = Center-of-Glazing U- value Ac = Center-of-Glazing Area (ISO, 2003)

The projected area (i.e. surfaces facing the plane), is placed on a plane parallel to the glass and does not comprise the total surface area of the frame and edge-of-glazing (LBNL, 2013) (see Figure 2). The frame, divider, edge-of-divider, edge-of-glazing and center-of-glazing U- values are calculated using a 2-D heat transfer simulation program approved by the NFRC. The Ucog values for the NFRC and CEN methods and the whole window U-values (Uw-NFRC) for the NFRC method (Uw-NFRC), are determined using the WINDOW 6.3 program. The THERM program applies a finite element method to a 2-D energy equation in order to calculate the frame and edge-of-glazing U-values; these values are utilized in WINDOW to determine the overall U-value (LBNL, 2013). THERM and Window (6.3 and 7.2) are part of the NFRC approved software list for conducting heat transfer modelling for fenestration products (NFRC, 2012). The NFRC procedure for determine whole window U-values (NFRC 100-2010) also states that all thermal transmittance calculations are to be based on computer simulations. Simulations in this research utilize THERM and WINDOW 6.3 to determine fenestration U-values since this version is specified for NFRC certification purposes; version 7.2 is primarily for fenestration products with shading devices. 2.2.1 Uframe Calculation in the NFRC Method In calculating Uframe, the rate of heat flow through the frame with the glazing unit inserted is accounted for along the projected length of the frame along the inside edge (see Figure 2). The rate of heat flow, Phi, is largely influenced by the temperature difference between the interior and exterior environments. The definition and calculation of the heat flow through the frame, fr, will be discussed further. The NFRC method and THERM use the following equation to calculate the frame U-value: (2) Where: Uframe-NFRC = frame U-value (W/m2K) frame = Phi of the frame; rate of heat flow through the frame (W/m) lframe = projected length of the frame area on the inside edge (m) Tni = temperature of the interior environment (K) Tne = temperature of the exterior environment (K) (ISO, 2003) 10

Since the frame U-value is determined by the NFRC method with the insulated glazing unit insert, UframeNFRC

not only accounts for the thermal transmittance through the frame, it also accounts for a portion of

the thermal transmittance effects of the glazing and spacer materials and configurations upon the frame. The majority of these thermal transmittance effects are comprised in the Uedge-NFRC variable. 2.2.2 Uedge Calculation in the NFRC method According to the NFRC method, by calculating an area-weighted edge-of-glazing region, (see Equation 3) the edge effects that occur at the junction of the frame, spacer and edge of glass area are taken into account (ISO, 2003). The edge effects describes the additional thermal transmittance that occurs between the glazing, frame, spacer and seals and helps to account for the interactions that occur and how they are influenced by differences in material thermal conductivities and configurations. The edgeof-glazing area is situated 63.5mm (2.5") from the inside frame edge. Uedge-NFRC accounts for the rate of heat flow through the edge-of-glazing area along the projected length of the inside edge of the frame with the glazing unit insert. Similar to Uframe-NFRC, the Uedge-NFRC calculation is largely influenced by the temperature difference between the interior and exterior environments. The NFRC method uses the following equation to calculate the edge-of-glazing U-value:
(3)

Where: Uedge-NFRC = edge-of-glazing U-value (W/m2K) edge = rate of heat flow through the edge-of-glazing area (W/m) ledge = projected length of the frame on the inside edge (m) Tni = temperature of the interior environment (K) Tne = temperature of the exterior environment (K) (ISO, 2003) The length of the edge-of-glazing area of 63.5 mm is used to lessen the difference between the two different thermal transmittance methods (ISO, 2003). The value of 63.5 mm that denotes the edge-ofglazing area was determined using 2-D computer modeling based on only conduction heat transfer effects. However, ASHRAE states that "in reality, because of convective and radiative effects, this area may extend beyond 63.5 mm (Beck et al., 1995; Curcija and Goss, 1994) and depends on the type of insulating glazing unit and its thickness" (ASHRAE, 2009). The variability of the area affected by the edge effects is discussed further in the section "Differences between the NFRC and CEN U-value Calculation Methods". 11

2.2.3 Phi Variable Phi in the Uframe-NFRC and Uedge-NFRC calculations is defined as the "heat flow in the direction of normal of the frame boundary segments for the frame section, and all of the edge boundary segments for the edge" (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, LBNL, 2014). THERM calculates Phi, on the indoor side of the frame boundary (from the end of the adiabatic surface to the sightline) (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2013). Phi-frame and Phi-edge account for the heat transfer effects of the glazing and the spacer "through the indoor surfaces of the frame and edge-of-glass areas (ISO, 2003)". Although Phi is a three dimensional variable, the NFRC method calculates U-values in a 2-D fashion using 2-D software (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2013). Therefore, the 3-D effects are not taken into account. 3-D modeling of the window components only achieves less than 1% of an improvement in accuracy; the amount of time and complexity of this modeling, in the point of view of various experts, does not seem suitable in order to attain this minute improvement (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2013). Some of the nomenclature used by the NFRC method is not the same nomenclature as what is found in ISO 15099 (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, LBNL, 2014). Heat flow, or Phi, is instead labeled as Q, which is considered standard notation for heat flow (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, LBNL, 2014). The governing equation that THERM uses for 2D conductive heat transfer or Q is sourced from the Conrad 5 & Viewer 5 Technical and Programming Documentation (LBNL, 2006) and is noted as follows:
( ) (4)

Where: K11 = conductivity in the x direction k22 = conductivity in the y direction T = temperature on surface (constant temperature on boundary surface) (LBNL, 2006) This calculation assumes that all materials have constant physical properties and that there is a constant temperature on each boundary surface.

12

2.2.4 NFRC Boundary Conditions According to Section 8.2 of ISO 15099, "Unless a specific set of boundary conditions is of interest (e.g., to match test conditions, actual conditions or to satisfy a national standard), the following standard boundary conditions shall be used." In order to adjust the international standard to be more fitting with the US (North American) climate as opposed to the European climate, the NFRC uses different boundary conditions than those outlined in the ISO 15099, for determining the overall U- value. For example, the ISO 15099 uses different exterior temperature, incident solar radiation, wind speed and surface film coefficients (see Table 1 & 2). The NFRC winter boundary conditions are outlined in the following table:
Table 1 Boundary Conditions used for NFRC U- value calculations

Boundary Condition Interior Ambient Temperature Exterior Ambient Temperature Wind Speed Outdoor Mean Radiant Temperature Indoor Mean Radiant Temperature Total flux of incident solar radiation

NFRC Tin Tout V Trm,out Trm,in Is 21Â°C -18Â°C 5.5 m/s Tout Tin 0 W/m2

ISO 15099 20Â°C 0Â°C 4 m/s (EN ISO 6946) Tout Tin 300 W/m2

Thermophysical properties of materials are referenced only from NFRC 101. The indoor and outdoor convective film coefficients are determined according to Section 8.3 in ISO 15099. The outdoor convective heat transfer coefficient is calculated based on the wind speed and then used on the outdoor surface of the glass and frame. Table 2 gives standard values that can be used for the outdoor convective film coefficient. The indoor convective heat transfer coefficient of the indoor surfaces of the glass and edge of glass area is based on the center-of-glazing temperature and the whole window height. The indoor convective film coefficients of the indoor surface of the frame are constants and vary according to the type of frame material; these are listed in Table 2.

2.3 The European (CEN) Thermal Transmittance Calculation Method
According to a convenor of one of the ISO responding CEN working group, European manufacturers currently use the Uwindow calculation as outlined in ISO 10077-1:2006 to determine the thermal transmittance of their window products (Norbert Sack, Convenor CEN TC89/WG7, and Dick van Dijk, August 12, 2013). "The thermal losses caused by the installation of the window in the wall are not taken into account in the U-value of the window." (Norbert Sack, Convenor CEN TC89/WG7, August 12, 2013) It is important to note that Uwindow only refers to the actual window product, the thermal characteristics of the window after installation differs and another calculation can be used to determine the thermal performance of the installed window. The Passive House Institute currently uses the installed window thermal transmittance, or  install for their calculations (Feist, 2006). -install measures "the linear thermal bridge at the junction of the wall and the window frame, and accounts for all additional losses or unexpected gains" (Speier, 2012). Techniques such as over-insulating the window frame on the exterior side can increase the thermal performance of the whole window (Speier, 2012). Although the NFRC and CEN thermal transmittance calculations differ, both procedures abide by the ISO standards.

14

As noted by one of these experts, the reason why there are different methods to calculate the U-value and solar heat gain coefficient is because of the "autonomy of each Technical Committee combined with historic reasons" (van Dijk, 2013). The industry sector is reluctant to certain changes because changing a standard would lead to a change in the product values and thus create conditions that are not always amicable on the point of view of the industry sector (van Dijk, 2013). Extrapolating from this, there is sometimes a large learning curve to learn the new method of calculating a window product value. It takes time and money to transition to the new changes and these changes would further involve retesting and recalculating the multitude of window products of every manufacturer. This is part of the reason why the window industry may be reluctant and why it takes time for changes to occur. Despite this reluctance, if required by codes and standards, manufacturers in effect, step up to the plate and meet the requirements in order to have their products on the market. Sweden, as mentioned earlier, mandated the use of triple-glazed windows as early as 1976 (Wilson, 2009). New methods may change the product values which may raise or lower the performance of individual window products. In the case of window products that receive a lower performance level with the new method, this situation can present itself as a challenge to manufacturers to improve the performance of their products. In this way the quality of window products on the market are raised. As of this writing, as assigned by ISO/TC 163/SC 2, experts are working to further the international standardization by removing the differences in the U-value and solar transmittance CEN and ISO calculation methods as well as removing the differences between the glazing product standards and window standards (Dick van Dijk, Sept 2, 2013). In this way, bridges are being forged between the standards and manufacturers in order to aid in the transition towards the use of amalgamated calculation methods. 2.3.1 CEN Uwindow Calculation Method Since the 1980s, the ISO worked on the development of thermal transmittance calculation methods for windows; the result of this work is the ISO 10077-1:2006 standard. The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) formulated the ISO 10077-2 to address the heat transfer specificities in the frame, particularly along the spacer and edge-of-glazing areas. In the CEN U-value calculation method of a single window, the thermal transmittance of the glazing and frame are calculated separately and the linear thermal transmittance ( value) is added to the summation (see Equation 5). The edge effects are taken into account in the  value (see Equation 8). European window manufacturers refer to the

15

following calculation to determine the whole window U-value, as outlined in ISO 10077-1; the U-value of the frame is calculated according to the procedures outlined in ISO 10077-2.



  



(5)

Where: Uw-CEN = Whole window U-value Ag = Glazing Area Ucog-CEN = Center-of-Glazing U-value Aframe = Frame Area Uframe = Frame U-value lg = length of the glazing area on the inside edge g =  value or linear thermal transmittance due to the combined thermal effects of the glazing, spacer and frame (ISO, 2012) This method is sometimes referred to as the `linear method' because it assumes that "the additional heat transfer due to the existence of the spacer is proportional to the glazing/frame sightline distance that is also proportional to the total glazing spacer length", thus giving a linear basis to the spacer heat transfer effects (Blanusa, et al., 2007).

2.3.2

Uframe calculation in the CEN method

In calculating Uframe-CEN, a calibration panel with a thermal conductivity of 0.035 W/mK replaces the glazing, (see Figure 3) in order to measure the thermal transmittance of the frame without the effect of the glazing (ISO, 2012). The center-of-panel U-value (Up) is located 190 mm from the sightline in order to obtain the U-value of the panel without potential thermal transmittance effects of the frame upon its U-value. The CEN method uses the following equation to calculate the frame U-value. (7) Where: Uframe-CEN = thermal transmittance of the frame (W/m2K) = thermal conductance of the section shown in Figure 2 Up = center of panel U-value (W/m2K) bp = visible width of the panel (larger width) (m) bf = projected width of the frame section (m) (ISO, 2012)

16

This constant approach in using the calibration panel to measure the thermal transmittance of the frame component allows for different frame products to be compared fairly (Richman, 2013). 2.3.3 Thermal Conductance of the Frame with the Calibration Panel ; see Figure 3) is calculated by

The thermal conductance of the frame with the calibration panel (

taking Uframe-CEN and multiplying it by the projected width of the frame section and adding it to the Uvalue of the calibration panel multiplied by its length. The U-value of the calibration panel (U'p) differs from the U-value of the center of the panel (Up), whereby U'p is calculated 190 mm from the sightline and the length of the calibration panel is set at 190 mm by ISO 10077-2. The calculation for the frame's thermal conductance with the calibration panel is as follows: (6) Where: = thermal conductance of the section shown in Figure 2 (W/mK) 2 = frame U-value with the calibration panel inserted (W/m K) = projected width of the frame section (m) = calibration panel U-value (190 mm from sightline) (W/m2K) = length of the calibration panel for 2-D heat transfer effects (fixed at 190 mm by ISO/CEN 10077) (mm) (LBNL, 2009) Since the U-value of the panel (U'p) is obtained along the entire 190 mm panel length (bp), the U'p accounts for a portion of the thermal transmittance effects that the frame materials and configuration has upon the panel's overall U-value.

The thermal conductance of the frame with the glazing unit (

projected width of the frame section and the height of the edge-of-glazing is 190 mm from the sightline. The thermal conductance affected by the interactions of the glazing, spacer and frame are accounted for by this calculation and the 190 mm edge-of-glazing area gives a sufficient length to account for any potential edge effects on the glazing. The thermal conductance calculation of the section shown in Figure 3 is as follows: (8) Where: = thermal conductance of the section shown in Figure 2 (W/mÂ·K) = frame U-value with glazing unit (W/mÂ·K) = projected width of the frame section (m) = edge of glazing U-value (W/mÂ·K) = height of the edge-of-glazing (m) (190 mm from the sightline) (LBNL, 2009)

2.3.5 -Value Calculation Method The  value calculation below describes the additional linear thermal transmittance, or -value ( ), that is derived by subtracting the thermal transmittance of the frame (see Equation 6) and the glazing by itself (Ug), from the two dimensional thermal conductance of the frame with the glazing installed (see Figure 4). In this way, the additional thermal transmittance that occurs from the interactions of the spacer, glazing and frame are taken into account in the  value.

(9)

Where:  = -value (linear thermal transmittance) (W/mÂ·K) = thermal conductance of the section shown in Figure 3 (W/mÂ·K) = frame U-value (with calibration panel) = projected width of the frame section (m) = glazing U-value = visible width of the glazing (m) (ISO, 2012)

In a study of the heat distribution of various components of a variety of residential buildings, the determination and evaluation of the  value showed that the thermal bridging through windows junctions entailed the largest thermal transmittance, 40% of the total specific heat loss of all the junctions (including the roof, walls and floor junctions) (Janssens, Van Londersele, Vandermarcke, Roels, Standaert, & Wouters, 2007). A  value of 0.10 W/mK was determined to be the maximum value for a window in order to prevent significant heat loss through the building envelope (Janssens et al., 2007). In determining the  values and isothermal lines of various window constructions, Ben-Nakhi (2002) found that the magnitude of thermal bridges could be assessed as well as the effectiveness of different window designs used to minimize thermal bridges. In this way design decisions can be compared and evaluated.

2.4 Primary Differences between the NFRC and CEN Uwindow Calculation Methods
The primary differences in the boundary conditions and other parameters between the NFRC and CEN methods for calculating Uwindow and the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient are outlined in Tables 3 and 4. The key boundary conditions highlighted are the interior and exterior temperatures, wind velocities, incident solar flux, and surface film coefficients.

Table 5 shows the way in which the surface resistances are given different values by both methods. The difference in the surface resistance values are significant because the surface resistance can be very influential in the overall insulative properties of a window (Hutcheon & Handegord, 1995). Griffith et al. (1996) found that the surface resistances or surface film coefficients differ according to local conditions.

The NFRC and CEN methods translate 2-D into 3-D thermal transmittance effects differently in their calculations (see Equations 1 and 5). In the NFRC method, the "2-D results for Uframe and Uedge (defined as 63.5 mm of glazing measured from sightline) and 1-D results for Ucog (glazing area excluding edge of glazing) are area-weighted to produce the whole product U-[value] (Curcija C. , Windows and Envelope Materials Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2013)". The CEN method uses the 2-D results for Uframe-CEN and Uedge-CEN; the 1-D results are used for Ucog-CEN and for linear thermal transmittance. The glazing U-value is treated as one dimensional by both methods, however, the CEN method takes into account the whole glazing area that is bordered by the sightline, whereas the NFRC method only takes into account the center-of-glazing area that is adjacent to the edge-of-glazing area (see Figure 2). 2.4.1 Uframe and Edge Effects The NFRC and CEN whole window calculation methods are similar in that they both account for the thermal conductivity of the frame with the IGU; where the CEN method uses UframeIGU-NFRC in the -value calculation (see Equation 9). However, as reiterated in the RDH Building Engineering Ltd. (2014) study, the Uframe values of both methods are not comparable. One of the key differences between the CEN method and the NFRC method is that the CEN method uses a calibration panel, with an extremely low thermal conductivity (i.e. 0.035 W/mK), to determine Uframe-CEN; Uframe-CEN is used in addition to UframeIGUNFRC

to derive the -value (see Equation 9). With the use of a calibration panel, the thermal

transmittance of the frame itself is acquired without the influence of the thermal properties and configurations of the IGU. The use of a calibration panel to determine Uframe-CEN gives a common standard element that can be used to compare frames on the same level (Wright G. , 2012). In addition, the calibration panel allows for the measurement and comparison of the incremental effect of the thermal performance of IGUs when combined with a frame configuration. Whereas in the NFRC method, the Uframe is determined by incorporating the simulated frame with the actual glazing system instead of a calibration panel (Gustavsen, Petter Jelle, Arasteh, & Kohler, 2007). Simulating the actual glazing system in the frame, when determining the thermal transmittance of the frame in the NFRC method, results in a Uframe value that includes a portion of the edge effects that occur from the heat transfer interactions of the actual glazing, spacer and frame materials. In addition, ISO (2003) states that the difference between the Uframe-NFRC and Uframe-CEN is that Uframe-NFRC incorporates "some of the heat transfer caused by the edge seal whereas Uframe-CEN does not". Thus, the edge effects are accounted for in the NFRC method by Uedge-NFRC and Uframe-NFRC and solely by the -value in the CEN method. Uframe-NFRC therefore does not give the thermal transmittance of the frame by itself, whereas 21

the CEN method gives a more accurate Uframe value due to the calibration panel. Seeing that the two methods have different calculations and thus explanations for the thermal transmittance of the frame, in effect, the ISO (2003) suggests that the same calculation be used for window products in order to compare them on the same grounds. The Uedge of both methods differ where Uedge-NFRC uses a length of 63.5 mm and UedgeIGU-CEN uses 190 mm to account for the edge effects. A study conducted by Blanusa et al. (2007) found the two methods differ in the way in which they treat the spacer and its interactive effects on the heat transfer of the frame and edge-of-glazing area. Carpenter and Elmahdy (1994) and Elmahdy (2004) showed that a 63.5mm region gave sufficient results for ten different windows, however, Curcija and Goss (1994)'s study found that 100 mm accounted for the frame and spacer 2-D heat transfer effects on the glazing, in a wood-framed window, more accurately than the 63.5mm region. In addition, Weitzmann et al. (2000) found that the 63.5 mm rule did not sufficiently encompass the two dimensional edge-of-glazing effects between the spacer, frame and glazing for a typical Danish wood-framed window. Rather, this study concluded that and edge-of-glass length of 150 mm was more accurate. ASHRAE (2009) acknowledged that due to the advance in technological innovations in the high performance window industry, the 63.5 mm value may not be sufficient for all windows. Determining the suitability of the 63.5 mm edge-of-glazing area by testing various high performance windows with a thermographic camera and measuring the edge effects of those captured images is acknowledged as an area that requires further research and is presently beyond the scope of this research. In the CEN method, a 190 mm region is used in the example frame and spacer profile calculations to capture the heat transfer effects of the frame and spacer (Blanusa, et al., 2007). Weitzmann et al. (2000) concluded that by using the 150 mm edge-of-glazing length in the NFRC method and by including the corner effect (using 3-D modelling software Heat 3), the three dimensional point heat loss, in the CEN method, the two methods will give identical U-value results. However, simulations in Heat3 are not as detailed as THERM and thus key details in the configuration of the spacer, frame and glazing are neglected and therefore the heat transfer interactions are not accounted for as accurately. 2.4.2 Frame Cavity Methods Heat transfer effects in the frame cavities are accounted for in THERM by applying an effective conductivity (keff) to these areas. Frame cavities are assumed to be a `solid' and are assigned an effective conductivity value that incorporates radiative and convective heat transfer effects in that area. 22

The convective heat transfer coefficient in the keff equation, according to the NFRC and CEN methods, uses the conductivity of air as the primary conductivity of this `solid' region (ISO, 2003; ISO, 2012; LBNL, 2012). The effective conductivity incorporates the geometry, heat flow direction, surface emissivity and temperature of the surrounding surfaces of the cavity region (LBNL, 2013). The NFRC and CEN methods and THERM use the following equation to determine the effective conductivity of frame cavities: (10) Where: keff = effective conductivity hc = convective heat transfer coefficient hr = radiative heat transfer coefficient (hr=0 in the case when detailed radiation procedure is used) d = thickness or width of the air cavity in the direction of heat flow (ASHRAE Standards Project Committee SPC 142, 2000; ISO, 2003; ISO, 2012)

2.4.3

Radiation Models for Frame Cavities

2.4.3.1 NFRC Radiation Models There are two types of radiation models for NFRC frame cavities, simplified and detailed; the simplified radiation model is most commonly used for the NFRC method. 1. Simplified Radiation Model: Based on the ASHRAE SPC 142P method, radiation heat transfer effects are modeled as "an effective conductance based on the temperature and emissivity of the two parallel [surfaces] perpendicular to the heat flow" (LBNL, 1998). The default values frame cavity surface temperatures are 7Â°C and Â­4Â°C and the emissivities of those surfaces are 0.90 (LBNL, 1998). 2. Detailed Radiation Model: Based on the computer program FACET, this model determines radiant heat transfer by incorporating the temperature and emissivity of the surrounding materials of a frame cavity and performs "an element-by-element view-factor calculation" (LBNL, 1998).

23

2.4.3.2 CEN Simplified Radiation Model The CEN method has only one radiation model. The CEN simplified radiation model replaces frame cavities with a relatively equivalent rectangular cavity with walls that have a constant temperature (LBNL, 1998). The radiative heat transfer (hr) is determined in this method using a view factor (F) for this section and a linear Stephan Boltzman law: (11) (12) (13) Where: T = Temperature  = emissivity L = the cavity dimension in the direction parallel to the heat flux H = the cavity dimension in the direction perpendicular to the heat flux (ISO, 2012; LBNL, 1998) The NFRC method uses the following calculation for the detailed radiation model (Roth, 1998):

(14) The radiative heat transfer coefficient hr is calculated according to Roth (1998) which is referred to by the former working group ASHRAE SPC 142. Since these calculations and the CEN calculations are identical, this proves that the CEN simplified and NFRC detailed radiation models are the same. The convective heat transfer coefficient in the CEN simplified radiation model uses a 10K temperature difference in its equation between the two frame cavity surfaces perpendicular to the heat flow; the thermal conductivity value of air at 10Â°C is used (ISO, 2012). The NFRC method uses different default temperatures for the frame cavity surfaces than ISO 15099 (2003): the ISO 15099 uses 0 and 10Â°C and the NFRC uses 7 and -4Â°C which is an 11Â°C temperature difference (LBNL, 1998). Although the difference in delta T between both methods is only 1Â°C, the different default temperatures used by both methods may influence the variations in U-value results.

24

The simplified radiation model used in the CEN method is only slightly different from the NFRC method. The CEN method incorporates the view factors of all the surfaces of a rectangular unventilated frame cavity to determine radiative heat flow, yet, the NFRC method only considers the emissivities of only the two surfaces that are perpendicular to the heat flow (ISO, 2012). The NFRC method only incorporates the temperatures and emissivities of the two walls that are perpendicular to the governing heat flow (LBNL, 1998). Overall, based on the NFRC (ASHRAE 142) and CEN (ISO 10077-2) equations the CEN simplified radiation model is analogous to the NFRC detailed radiation model. 2.4.4 Unventilated and Ventilated Frame Cavity Models

The NFRC method refers to the cavity model as outlined in ISO 15099 and the CEN method refers to the cavity model outlined in ISO 10077-2.

2.4.4.1 NFRC Unventilated Frame Cavities Cavities that are enclosed and those that have an opening to the exterior that is less than or equal to 2 mm, are considered to be unventilated cavities (ISO, 2003). The effective conductivity is calculated based on a rectangle that fully encloses the cavity (the specific correlations used can be found in ASHRAE SPC 142P) (LBNL, 1998). The NFRC method assumes that the heat flow direction flows linearly in a horizontal, up or down direction. The NFRC method determines the direction of heat flow in unventilated cavities according to the following rules:  Horizontal heat flow: the temperature difference between the vertical cavity surfaces is greater than the difference between the horizontal surfaces  Vertical heat flow up: the temperature difference between the horizontal cavity surfaces is greater than the difference between the vertical cavity surfaces and the bottom cavity surface temperature is higher than the top surface temperature  Vertical heat flow down: same as the vertical heat flow up except that the difference between the vertical cavity surfaces and the top cavity surface temperature is higher than the bottom surface temperature (ASHRAE Standards Project Committee SPC 142, 2000; ISO, 2003)

25

NOTE: Although the ASHRAE SPC 142 has been disbanded due to a lack of support and that there was an ISO standard on the same topic, their draft document is referenced by the THERM manual (ASHRAE, 2014; LBNL, 1998). When the heat flow direction is horizontal, the effective conductivity is determined by incorporating the temperature difference and the average emissivity values of only the vertical surfaces that are perpendicular to the heat flow (LBNL, 1998). Thus the frame cavity wall temperatures and emissivities are based upon the temperature and emissivities of the surrounding materials.

2.4.4.2 CEN Unventilated Frame Cavities The unventilated cavities according to the CEN method are defined as air cavities that are enclosed or slightly open to the interior or exterior with a slit that is less than or equal to 2 mm. The effective conductivity of the CEN unventilated cavity model is also based on a rectangle, however, the rectangle has the same aspect ratio as the cavity being analyzed (LBNL, 1998). This cavity model is used with the CEN simplified radiation model. 2.4.4.3 Slightly Ventilated Frame Cavities The NFRC and CEN methods both have the same definition for slightly ventilated cavity spaces where cavities that have an opening to the exterior environment that is greater than 2 mm and less than or equal to 10 mm (ISO, 2003; ISO, 2012; LBNL, 2013). The slightly ventilated cavity models are only applicable to the side of the window that has an opening that faces and ventilates to the exterior environment. 2.4.4.4 Well-Ventilated Frame Cavities The NFRC and CEN methods define a cavity with an opening to the exterior that is greater than 10 mm as a well-ventilated frame cavity and is considered to be fully exposed to the environment. Since a wellventilated frame cavity is fully exposed to the environment, it is assumed that it has a surface film resistance; thus CEN uses a surface film coefficient as stated in ISO 10077-2 for surfaces with increased resistance for these cavity surfaces. 2.4.5 Impacts of these Differences on Whole Window U-values When using different boundary conditions with the same calculation method, Roth (1998) showed that the NFRC boundary conditions give larger U-values than the CEN boundary conditions, primarily due to 26

the overall heat transfer coefficient value being larger. In other studies, Blanusa (2001) and Weitzmann et al. (2000) found that for both boundary conditions, the CEN method gave larger U-values than the NFRC method: Weitzmann et al. (2000) noted that the difference was due to the 2-D effects present in heights above 63.5 mm in the edge method. Furthermore, this study showed that the linear method gave more correct U-values when using 2-D and 3-D models. Generally, the thermal transmittance of glazing is lower than the thermal transmittance of the frame for high performance windows. The frame to glazing area ratio changes with different sizes of windows. Thus, the influence of the different thermal transmittances of the frame and glazing on the overall window U-value increases with differently sized windows (Wright G. , 2012). More specifically, regarding the variation in window sizes, "The difference in Uw-values between the two calculation methods decreases as the total area of the window increases (Blanusa, 2001; Blanusa, et al, 2007). Blanusa (2001) found that the differences ranged from 1.4% for the smaller windows to 0.6% for the larger windows in the study. Despite using the same boundary conditions, Roth (1998) found that the two methods gave different results for the smaller windows in the study: a difference of 3.5% for a thermally broken aluminum framed window, 3% for a PVC framed window and 2.3% for a wood framed window. The agreement between the methods was found to be dependent upon the geometry of the window (Blanusa, et al., 2007). The different equations lead to the difference in the methods because of the way that the corner regions of the window frame and glazing are treated (Blanusa, et al., 2007)". It is also noted by ISO 15099 (2003) that the different whole window calculation methods may yield different U-values because the heat transfer that occurs on the frame and edge are not dealt with in the same way and due to the fact that these methods do not consider the three dimensional effects of heat transfer in these areas. In contrast to Blanusa's findings regarding the larger differences in whole window U-values with larger window areas, the differences between the 3-D effects of both calculation methods are more evident when applied to smaller windows (ISO, 2003). Gustavsen et al. (2008) suggests that the current methods in the ISO 15099 standard are not sufficient to model the heat transfer through low conductance frames, yet it is sufficient for modelling high conductance frames. Rather, more intricate algorithms are needed in order for current modelling programs are to be used for the design and improvement of low-conductance frames. Gustavsen et al. (2008) instead found that low conductance frames could be modeled accurately with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models, in fact, CFD modeling was seen as necessary for analyzing convective heat transfer in vertical frame cavities. However, conducting CFD models and tests were quite time 27

consuming, "approximately 500 times longer than performing a 2D conduction run in THERM" (Gustavsen, Arasteh, Petter Jelle, & Curcija, 2008). Since the CEN method uses a lower temperature difference, European windows tend to have a lower Uvalue calculation result (Young, 2012). In the window industry, some are of the opinion that the CEN method is more relevant for Canada, since the average temperature in Canada is approximately -3Â°C which is closer to CEN's exterior boundary condition (0Â°C) than the NFRC's (-18Â°C) (Gibson, 2012; RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). In addition, in North America, the NFRC boundary conditions are more suited for sizing heating systems, whereas the CEN boundary conditions are more suited for determining the annual heating fuel consumption, (which is based on the average temperature of the year rather than extremes of temperature) (Gibson, 2012; RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). At the time of his report, Curcija (2005) identified some key problematic areas with regards to the differences between the two methods:       Convective heat transfer correlations are inaccurate and outdated The assumption that there is a fixed temperature difference across the window system is incorrect and does not reflect what happens in reality A specified approach to irregular frame cavities, heat flow directions, frame cavity surface emissivities, etc. is lacking The radiation boundary condition is too simplified as it does not account for different emissivities and treats reduced radiation heat transfer in the corner regions as a constant "Simplified treatment of gas mixtures (Curcija C. , 2005)" Lack of g-factor (solar heat gain coefficient) calculations

The RDH Building Engineering Ltd. (2014) study looked at the differences between the CEN and NFRC calculation methods using two North American windows, vinyl and fiberglass-frames, and a vinyl-framed European window; all with argon gas infill and a thin-wall stainless steel, dual seal spacer. The following are some of the significant conclusions from this study:   Ucog-NFRC values were between zero and 23% higher than Ucog-CEN values. Larger gap sizes gave the larger differences (14-23%). Uwindow-NFRC values were found to be 14% lower to 18% higher than the CEN values.

28

  

Uframe values differed where the NFRC U-values were found to be 5% lower to 24% higher than CEN values. SHGC values for the whole window were up to 50% lower than the center-of-glazing SHGC values. NFRC SHGC values for the center-of-glazing were between 1% and 8% lower than CEN SHGC values (RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014)

Uframe is a key component in the whole window U-value and thus discrepancies in how both calculation methods address this parameter has a significant impact on the overall window U-value (RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). The study concluded that the difference in the Uframe values of each method is attributed to the fundamentally different Uframe calculation approaches (RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). Different thermal conductivities for the same materials are used in each method which also helps to account for some of the discrepancies between the Uframe values. Little difference was present between the fiberglass frame U-values of both methods due to the lower thermal conductivity value in the NFRC method than the CEN method which compensated for some of the differences when using the low thermal conductivity of the calibration panel in place of the actual glazing (RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). In addition, the RDH study (2014) concluded that the way in which these two methods approach the edge effects, i.e. -value (CEN) and Uedge-NFRC are vastly differently and are therefore not comparable. Due to the use of a calibration panel, the whole insulated glazing unit, and a different calculation in the simulation, the CEN method approach is not the same as the NFRC calculation and method where only the whole insulated glazing unit is simulated to determine Uedge-NFRC. Foremost, RDH's study suggests that the "NFRC and ISO U-values cannot be compared [because] they are based on different calculation procedures", instead, subscripts of each method for U-values are suggested to be used; i.e. UNFRC and UISO (RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). The climate-specific high performance window simulations conducted in the research may support this finding from the RDH study.

3 Methodology
3.1 Summary
Using 2-D simulation software, THERM and WINDOW, the effects of changing various parameters and boundary conditions upon the thermal transmittance of four high performance windows with various glazing combinations, were simulated and calculated according to the NFRC and CEN standard methods. The four frame cross-section types that were used are: an insulated fiberglass window frame, a thermally broken solid wood frame, a U-PVC frame and a solid wood frame (see Figures 5-8). Ucog was calculated using WINDOW and Uframe and Uedge values were calculated using THERM for both methods. The CEN method incorporates an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the Uwindow and the -value; whereas the NFRC method imports THERM results into WINDOW to configure the Uwindow, Ucog and SHGC results. WINDOW was used to calculate the SHGC for the CEN method and the NFRC method for glazing combinations without the frame. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory documentation that outlines how to model window units according to the NFRC method "THERM 6.3 / WINDOW 6.3 NFRC Simulation Manual", and "Calculating Fenestration Product Performance in WINDOW 6 And THERM 6 according to EN 673 and EN 10077", for the CEN method, were both adhered to for the NFRC and CEN simulations respectively (LBNL, 2009). The use of simulation programs is validated by national and international organizations whereby the "algorithms used by THERM and WINDOW, for the calculation of [the whole window U-value] and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient, are consistent with ASHRAE SPC142, ISO 15099, and the National Fenestration Rating Council (LBNL, 2013)". THERM and WINDOW are on the NFRC's approved software list. For a further discussion on the efficacy of computer simulations vs. lab testing see Section 7. Uwindow, Ucog, Uframe and -values were evaluated by comparing the use of different boundary conditions and assumptions in the NFRC and CEN calculation methods in determining thermal transmittance by using variables in different combinations (see Section 4) from the following simulation matrix:

3.2 Window Type and Size
Operable single casement windows were simulated seeing that casement windows contain sashes, whereby the frame configuration is more intricate, than fixed windows. The NFRC standard size of casement windows is 1.5 m x 0.6 m (see Table 7); these dimensions were used for the NFRC method, even if the standard size differs from the actual window product size. Although the actual window product dimensions are used in the CEN method, the NFRC standard size for casements was used for the CEN simulations for the purpose of comparability of the same product. It is recommended that future studies simulate fixed high performance windows, as well as varying sizes.

3.4 Spacer Materials
The spacers of all of the high performance windows have different materials, configurations and thermal conductivities. Various combinations of the double, triple and quad insulated glazing units were paired with each frame type in the simulations; the Uwindow, Uframe and -values of window units with higher conductive spacers were compared with windows with lower conductive spacers. The three primary simulated spacers used are from different manufacturers and are labeled A, B and C. The simulated spacers used are those of the original product, as detailed by the manufacturer. With a height of 12 mm, Spacer A primarily comprises of an insulating plastic composite material with a stainless steel gas tight barrier foil. With a height of 7.874 mm, Spacer B comprises a stainless steel, dessicant, a primary polyisobutylene (PIB) seal and a silicone secondary seal. With a height of 12 mm, Spacer C comprises silicone foam with a dessicant pre-fill, a polyisobutylene primary seal and a silicone secondary seal. For the high performance windows that incorporate Heat MirrorTM technology, the required thermallybroken metal spacers are used to provide structural support for the thin plastic film/heat mirror.

3.5 Glazing Configurations
The glazing configurations were chosen based on the technical specifications of several high performance North American window manufacturers. For each glazing configuration, Surface #1 refers to the glazing surface that faces the exterior environment and the ID numbers of each glazing type used in the WINDOW software are included. The gas infill in each of the triple and quadruple glazing configurations comprised 90% krypton and 10% air. This is the typical percentage that manufacturer's achieve and is the amount that NFRC simulations require (LBNL, 2013). Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory documentation, which outlines how to model according to the CEN method in THERM, also uses these air and krypton gas percentages (LBNL, 2009). For the NFRC method, the NFRC thermal conductivity values for krypton and air were used and for the CEN method, the CEN thermal conductivity values were used for the simulations. The glass thickness was based on the standard size of 3 mm, however, for specific glazing configurations such as the quadruple glazing, a 4 mm glass thickness was

34

used according to the manufacturer's product. In order to adhere to the manufacturer's drawings, the insulated glazing unit was 34 mm in order to fit each frame; except for the quadruple glass pane window, which is 52 mm. The overall glazing cavity width for the window units were based on the manufacturers' technical specifications for each insulated glazing unit. The following glazing configurations were simulated: 3.5.1 Double IGU The double pane glazing combinations were used as a base case scenario for high performance glazing and were compared to other glazing combinations.

3.6 Gas Infill Mixtures
The CEN method refers to EN 673 and ISO 10292 for the thermal conductivities of all gases; the standard temperature that is used for the thermal conductivity is 10Â°C (see Table 17).

However, in THERM the thermal conductivity of air and krypton at 0Â°C, at standard temperature and conditions (STP), are used instead of at 10Â°C (see Table 18).

The thermal conductivity values used in the THERM gas library for the CEN method are slightly less than what the ISO standards recommend and may contribute to differences in center-of-glazing results. Since EN 673 does not provide the various conductivity, viscosity and specific heat coefficients that THERM requires to determine the thermal conductivity of the gases, the THERM default values for the pure gases were used for all simulations. The krypton/air gas mixtures that are typically used by manufactures are: 1. air (5%) and krypton (95%) 2. air (10%) and krypton (90%) The NFRC method uses the thermal conductivity of krypton at 0Â°C for the -18Â°C boundary condition. In order to verify the thermal conductivity of the two krypton and air gas mixtures at -18Â°C, the gas property calculator from WINDOW was used. The gas property calculator is limited to thermal conductivity values with three decimal places. The thermal conductivities of infill gas mixtures of krypton gas were simulated for nine temperatures ranging from -40 to 40Â°C. Tables 19 and 20 show that the thermal conductivities of the krypton and air gas mixtures are identical at 0Â°C. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the air/krypton gas mixtures that THERM uses are consistent for the NFRC and CEN methods.

38

In comparison to the value at 0Â°C, for the 5%/95% gas mixture, the thermal conductivities slightly decrease by 0.001 W/mK at -30Â°C for both methods and increase at 10 and 20Â°C for the CEN and NFRC methods respectively (see Table 19). For the 10%/90% gas mixture, the thermal conductivities increase by 0.001 W/mK at 30Â°C, decrease by 0.001 W/mK at -10Â°C, and by 0.002 at -40Â°C (see Table 20).

It is acknowledged that further research could involve obtaining the conductivity, viscosity and specific heat coefficients for the gases taken from EN 673 and inputting these values in THERM. The thermal conductivities of the gas mixtures for each change in the temperature boundary condition could be simulated to see how the change in thermal conductivity, according to temperature, affects the thermal transmittance of the glazing (Ug). Although some of the manufacturers use 95% krypton and 5% air (according to EN673) in their simulations, for this research the krypton/air gas percentage mixture of 90/10 was used in the simulations in order to adhere to the NFRC standard.

3.7 Interior Temperature Boundary Conditions
For the eight climate zones, an indoor temperature of 21Â°C for exterior temperatures that are below 30Â°C, were used to concur with the NFRC's and ASHRAE's indoor standard design temperatures. For the exterior temperatures that are 30Â°C and above, an indoor temperature of 24Â°C was used for the Ucog simulations; this coincides with the NFRC summer boundary conditions (see Table 22). Since there is a minute change in U-values when the NFRC and CEN standard interior temperatures were used, the Uwindow, Uframe and -value simulations use the NFRC and CEN standard interior temperature of 21Â°C and 20Â°C in order to normalize the results rather than the summer design interior temperatures for the 30Â°C and 40Â°C exterior temperature simulations.

3.8 Exterior Temperature Boundary Conditions of North America's Climate Zones
The insulated glazing units (IGUs) were simulated in the IECC's eight climate zones of North America (U.S. Dept. of Energy, 2009). Simulating in the 8 climate zones highlighted potential differences and patterns of thermal transmittance observed for the four test windows. The four windows were tested using the average annual, winter and summer design temperatures specific to each zone as the exterior temperature boundary conditions, according to ASHRAE (ASHRAE, 2009). Using the NFRC and CEN calculation methods, the Uwindow, Ucog and Uframe values were derived from the simulations and compared. It will be determined if there are any significant differences between these U-values and the extent of influence that the exterior temperatures in each climate zone have on the Uvalues.

3.9 Winter and Summer Design Conditions
Standard winter boundary conditions were specified for the NFRC method and CEN method (ISO 100771) (see Table 21). Considering that the CEN method does not have specified summer boundary conditions, the summer boundary conditions as outlined by ISO 15099, Section 8.2, were used in the simulations as a baseline case for the CEN method (see Table 22). The NFRC has specified summer boundary conditions as stated in NFRC 200-2010: Procedure for Determining Fenestration Product Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and Visible Transmittance at Normal Incidence (See Table 22). Chen and Wittkopf (2011) use 7.7 W/m2K for the interior convective surface film coefficient for the summer conditions in their simulations. This value

was derived from the NFRC test conditions according to the winter interior temperature of 21Â°C from NFRC 102-2010.

3.10 North America's Climate Zones: Inland and Coastal locations
The 99% dry bulb temperature (i.e. defined as the January 1% in Canada) was used for the winter design temperature (ASHRAE, 2009). For the summer design temperature, the July 1% dry bulb temperature was used (ASHRAE, 2009). The winter frequency of 99.6% and the summer frequency of 0.4% was used for designing for extreme weather conditions which is not suited to this research.

3.11 Climate Specific U-values
In order to obtain an overall measure of the annual energy performance of a window, the average temperature of each climate zone was required. As mentioned earlier, the summer and winter design temperatures are primarily used to size heating and cooling systems, therefore, the summer and winter design temperatures were used to set the range of climate temperature ranges for each climate zone. To highlight the average annual energy performance, the average annual high and low temperatures and the average temperatures of each climate zone (as obtained from Environment Canada) were used to define the average annual climate zone temperature range. The average temperature of each climate zone was not chosen to define each climate zone considering the variability of temperature in each climate zone. In order to accommodate for this variability, a specified range was defined for each climate zone based on the chosen location. For example, for Toronto, the annual average temperature is 9.2Â°C and the average annual high and low temperatures are 5.6 and 12.7Â°C respectively. Based on this, the average annual temperature range for Toronto was defined as being between 5.6 and 12.7Â°C. The annual average temperatures and the annual average high and low temperatures were based on average monthly temperatures over a 30 year period (Environment Canada, 2013) (Environment Canada, 2007).

For the U.S. locations, the average annual high and low temperatures were obtained from normalized data from several public domain sources including the Southeast, High Plains, Midwestern and Western Regional Climate Centers and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC Clim81 1981-2010) (Canty and Associates LLC, 2014). The climate specific annual average Uwindow values and the standard Uwindow-NFRC value that is assigned to the North American continent were compared to see the applicability of the NFRC standard boundary conditions in the eight climate zones.

3.12 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient
The fraction of incident solar radiation that enters the building interior through a window unit is defined as the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) (Efficient Windows Collaborative, 2012). The fraction of solar radiation that a window allows to pass through itself does not change therefore despite the different levels of incident solar radiation in the 8 climate zones, the SHGC remains the same. For example, an SHGC of 0.3 will allow 30% of the solar radiation (i.e. 500 or 700 W/mÂ², see Table 22) to pass through itself no matter the location of the window and the amount of incident solar radiation in that location. The Solar Heat Gain Coefficient of the CEN and NFRC methods are calculated differently and were compared for several glazing combinations. Considering the NFRC standard method requires that the frame characteristics be incorporated into the SHGC calculation; high and low SHGCs for the double and triple IGUs, and the quad IGU with a high SHGC were simulated with each frame type. In addition, without the influence of the frame, the NFRC and CEN SHGC calculation methods were compared for several IGU combinations. 43

3.13 Gap Sizes
Ucog is calculated differently by the NFRC and CEN method; the CEN method is considered more simplified. The Ucog values of the test high performance windows with different gap sizes were simulated according to the exterior temperature boundary conditions of each climate zone for the NFRC and CEN methods, to see the effect of various temperature ranges on different gap sizes. For the double and triple glazing units, the Ucog values were simulated using the NFRC and CEN methods and standard boundary conditions as a base case scenario. The gap size range was between 6-20 mm in increments of 2mm for a single spacer, as drawn from RDH Building Engineering Ltd. (2014) and LBNL studies (Kohler, 2012).

3.14 Location Specific Wind Velocities in North America's Climate Zones
To determine the impact of wind velocity on the Uwindow and Ucog, the wind velocities of coastal cities in each climate zones were simulated. It is important to note that the wind velocity can be changed in WINDOW however, in THERM, the wind velocity is accounted for in the surface film coefficient on the exterior side. In the NFRC method, each frame material is assigned a convective surface heat transfer coefficient that has a constant value and is temperature dependent as outlined by each method (see Section 3.16) (LBNL, 2013). Given that wind velocities are greatest during the winter months and weakest in the summer, the lowest value given for the extreme annual wind velocities, where the wind speed is higher than the stated speed 5% out of all the hours of the year, and the winter design temperatures were used according to ASHRAE's climatic design conditions. The smaller percentage values (1 and 2.5%) were not chosen for they are used for extreme design conditions for "estimating peak loads to account for infiltration" (ASHRAE, 2009). Instead, this research takes a more conservative approach to account for the high 45

variability and unpredictability of the wind speed year round, noting that the results give a measurable extreme case scenario since winter design temperatures were used. The Uwindow values were compared to the inland locations of each climate zone to see the effect of different wind velocities (see Tables 23 and 24). It is important to note that the direction and velocity of the wind are largely influenced by the nature of the geographical surface features and the slope of the land. ASHRAE's wind data (extreme annual design conditions) was taken from locations that have a relatively flat terrain and an open exposure. Thus various conditions that may affect the results include areas that have more convoluted geographical features where the wind speed and direction may be quite different from the wind data that has been taken from airport locations. In these locations, a year-long site specific wind study would need to be conducted to properly assess the local wind conditions (ASHRAE, 2009). This area is beyond the scope of this research.

3.15 Material Thermal Conductivities
Some of the thermal conductivity values of the materials that are referenced to in each calculation method have been assigned different values. This difference may have a significant effect on the Uwindow, Uframe and Ucog. For each calculation method, the values of the materials that have different thermal conductivities for each test window were drawn from the following documents: ISO 10077-2, the NFRC 101-2010 and Procedure for Determining Thermophysical Properties of Materials for Use in NFRC-Approved Software. For a list of the material thermal conductivities used in the simulated frame types, see Table 25. The primary materials that have significant different thermal conductivities are fiberglass and typical softwood; these values were used in the simulations. Each test window was simulated according to:    the NFRC method with NFRC thermal conductivities and compare with the CEN method using ISO thermal conductivities (using standard boundary conditions) the NFRC and CEN method using NFRC thermal conductivities the NFRC and CEN method using CEN thermal conductivities

3.16 Surface Film Coefficients (Boundary Conductances)
The surface film coefficients used in each of the calculation methods were assigned different values (see Table 26). The degree of influence of these different surface film coefficients on the Uwindow and Uframe were evaluated for each of the test high performance windows. The CEN method's surface film coefficients combine the convective and radiation coefficients; whereas the NFRC method does not include the radiation component in the surface film coefficient value as it is included in the radiation model in the simulations. Therefore, when replacing CEN surface film coefficient values with NFRC values, the radiation component is being neglected and thus this is only a theoretical scenario to determine the effect of various surface film coefficient values upon Uwindow and Uframe. Each test window was simulated according to:   the NFRC and CEN method using NFRC surface film coefficients the NFRC and CEN method using CEN surface film coefficients

Note: It was found that switching the surface film coefficients of both methods was not possible in real terms due to the radiation coefficient calculation being temperature dependent according to the EN ISO 6946 (2007) (see Equations 18 & 19). The NFRC radiation coefficient is slightly lower than the CEN radiation coefficient due to the lower exterior temperature used in the NFRC method. Although the convective coefficients are interchangeable, a small difference of 1.5 m/s in the wind speeds of both methods (i.e. NFRC = 5.5 m/s; CEN = 4 m/s) was not considered a significant influence on Uwindow simulations. Representative simulations of the inland and coastal locations, as discussed in Section 3.10, which use the various winter design temperatures and wind velocities specific to each location, gives a more accurate comparison of surface film coefficient values for each method. 47

For this research the surface film coefficients of the NFRC and CEN methods were used for all climate zone simulations. It is acknowledged that the surface film coefficient can significantly change with various wind velocities which can in turn affect a window's overall U-value. Hutcheon and Handegord (1995) give some examples of equivalent total surface film conductances used for different wind velocities (see Table 27).

Hence, further research is required to see how the whole window U-values are affected by surface film coefficients that are determined according to the wind velocities that are climate zone specific. The surface film coefficients were used to account for the heat transfer characteristics that occur at the interior and exterior glazing and frame surfaces. An equivalent conductance or resistance is assigned as the surface film coefficient at these surfaces, and it incorporates the radiative and convective heat transfer coefficients (Straube J. , 2003). Seeing that convective heat transfer is significantly impacted by wind velocity and that it is a substantial factor in determining the exterior surface film coefficient, the exterior surface film coefficient is highly influenced by the velocity and the direction of the wind (LBNL, 2013; Straube J. , 2003). In determining Uframe, THERM considers emissivity, temperature and a constant convective heat transfer coefficient (LBNL, 2013). On the exterior side, the convective heat transfer coefficient is dependent on the wind velocity (LBNL, 2013). Since Uframe can incorporate the different wind velocities of the climate zones with the use of the convective heat transfer coefficient on the exterior side, Uframe can give an indication of the impact of these wind velocities on the frame's thermal transmittance. 3.16.1 NFRC Exterior Convective Film Coefficient Section 8.3.3.3 of ISO 15099 gives a convective heat transfer coefficient calculation for the exterior side for comparing and rating window products:

Where:

(15)

hcv,ex = convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m2K)
Vs = free stream velocity near the fenestration surfaces (m/s) The NFRC method uses this calculation to determine the exterior convective film coefficient: Given: Vs = 5.5 m/s (NFRC standard wind velocity)

hcv,ex = 4 + 4(5.5) = 26 W/m2K (NFRC standard exterior convective film coefficient)

49

In order to account for the effect of the different wind velocities on the exterior convective film coefficient in each climate zone, the exterior convective film coefficient was calculated according to ISO 15099 for the NFRC method (see Table 28).

3.16.2 CEN Exterior Surface Film Coefficient The CEN method uses surface film coefficients according to ISO 6946. The exterior surface film coefficient is determined by the addition of the convective and radiative heat transfer coefficient and inversing that value. The inverse of the surface film resistance (Rs) was used as the surface film coefficient (hcr) in order to equate the metrics of W/m2K used in THERM and the NFRC method. The wind velocities of the eight climate zone locations were inputted into this calculation to determine the exterior surface film coefficients that are specific for each climate zone (see Tables 23 and 24). The calculation is as follows: (16) And:

50

(17) Where:

hcr = surface film coefficient (W/m2K) (no decimal places) Rs = surface film resistance (m2K/W) (rounded to two decimal places)
= convection heat transfer coefficient (W/m2K) = radiative heat transfer coefficient (W/m2K) (German Institute for Standardization, 1999)

(18) (19) Where: = Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10-8 W/m2K)

 = surface emissivity (0.9) hr0 = blackbody radiation heat transfer (rounded to one decimal place)
= average thermodynamic temperature of the surface and its surroundings (K) (German Institute for Standardization, 1999) For the internal surface where the heat flow is horizontal, the convective heat transfer coefficient used was: hc = 2.5 W/m2K. For an external surface, the convective heat transfer coefficient calculation is the same as the ISO 15099/NFRC method: (20) Where: Vs = free stream velocity near the fenestration surfaces (m/s) (German Institute for Standardization, 1999) Using these equations, the standard exterior surface film coefficient used in the CEN method was calculated as follows:

Given: Vs = 4 m/s and the exterior temperature = 0Â°C = 273.15 K Rs = 1 / [4+4(4)] + [0.9(4)(5.67 x 10-8)(273.153)]
51

= 1 / (20) + 0.9(4.6) = 1 / 24.14 = 0.04 m2K/W

hcr = 1 / 0.04 = 25 W/m2K (CEN standard exterior surface film coefficient)
Tables 29 and 30 outline the different variables calculated according to the CEN/ISO 6946 surface film coefficient calculation (see Equations 16-20) for the inland and coastal locations in the eight climate zones. Calculating the surface film coefficient (hcr) according to CEN/ISO 6946 resulted in values with little variation. Due to the limitation of decimal places for the blackbody radiation heat transfer (hro) and surface film resistance (Rs), the variation in the surface film coefficient values at different temperatures are normalized and account for the little variation of values (i.e. 33 and 50 W/m2K) for all climate zones. In order to show the variation of surface film coefficients and how they are impacted by the different wind velocities, the surface resistance (Rs) was rounded to three decimal places and then placed in Equation 17. These new values are given in Tables 29 and 30 under hcr (new method).

It is more evident in the new values how the surface film coefficient values reflect the impact of the variations in wind velocities for each climate zone. These values are similar to the variation seen in ASHRAE's values according to wind velocity in Table 27. Table 28 gives the NFRC exterior surface film coefficients (hcr) specific to the eight climate zones based on the CEN/ISO 6946 surface resistance calculation method. These values were used for the NFRC simulations accounting for the different wind velocities for the eight climate zones. The surface film coefficients used in the CEN method are higher than the NFRC method because they are based on different calculations. The CEN method incorporates the radiative and the convective heat transfer, whereas the NFRC method just includes the convective heat transfer for the surface film

53

coefficient. The NFRC method accounts for radiation in its view-factor based radiation methods as outlined in ISO 15099.

3.17 NFRC and CEN Interior Surface Convective and Surface Film Coefficients
The interior surface film coefficient incorporates the difference between the interior room temperature, the interior surface temperature of the window, and the height of the window (LBNL, 2013). It was assumed that the interior surface was primarily subject to natural convection and that the surface temperature was influenced by the material properties and configuration (LBNL, 2013). For all the simulations, since the interior room conditions were consistent, the interior convective and surface film coefficients were used for each method (see Table 26).

3.18 Frame Cavity Methods
The way in which the two calculation methods treat frame cavities are complex. ISO 15099 (NFRC reference) is similar to ISO 10077-2 in determining what is ventilated and what is not, however, they differ in the way equivalent simplified geometries are given in order to give an equivalent thermal conductivity to the cavities. ISO 15099 is generally more complex than ISO 10077-2 (see Section 2.4.2). The differences of these two calculation methods were analyzed with the high performance windows that have frame cavities. The surface film coefficients and frame cavity methods were simulated using winter boundary conditions for all test simulations seeing that in smaller temperature differentials, there is less opportunity for thermal transmittance by radiation, convection and conduction.

3.19 -Values
Given that the NFRC method does not use a -value, Graham (2012) postulated the following equation to configure an NFRC -value: UEDGE Â­ UCOG) Â· lEDGE (Graham, 2012) (21)

However, this equation does not take into account the additional thermal transmittance that occurs in the frame, seeing that the edge effects in the NFRC method are incorporated for the most part in Uedge, but also slightly in Uframe. Also, the Uedge height value is only 63.5 mm and it's not analogous to the CEN method's minimum glazing height (i.e. 150 mm). Therefore, to determine the thermal bridging potential in each of the eight climate zones, the -value used in the CEN method was calculated.  NFRC and CEN boundary conditions for the CEN method 54



Boundary conditions of North American climate zones in the CEN method

Average temperature ranges for each climate zone were used for the -value simulations to measure potential thermal bridging through the frame junctions; seeing that larger temperature differentials have a greater impact on the conduction in frames.

5 Results and Discussion
The results of this study aid in identifying and explaining the percentage change between both methods, as well as, determining how each method defines and utilizes various parameters; and defining the most influential parameters in the percentage change differences.

5.1 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient Simulations
The Solar Heat Gain Coefficient varies for different frame materials when calculated according to the NFRC method. The NFRC standard method takes into account the frame of the actual window unit with the glazing when calculating the SHGC, whereas, the CEN method only considers the glazing by itself at a 1000 mm height and width. The NFRC method is unique in that the solar radiation absorbed and transmitted through the frame is included in the SHGC calculation. The NFRC method also takes into account the glazing at the height of the actual window unit rather than the default 1000 mm height in WINDOW: for example, for a casement window, a height of 1500 mm and 600 mm width is used in the SHGC calculation. Including the solar radiation transmission through the frame and the actual glazing height results in a large discrepancy between NFRC and CEN SHGC values.

All four frame types were simulated using double and triple IGUs with Spacer C (see Tables 33-36). The NFRC SHGC values were found to be 24- 46% lower than CEN SHGC values due to the inclusion of the frame and the actual IGU product dimensions in the NFRC SHGC method. This is similar to the findings of the RDH Building Engineering Ltd. (2014) study where the NFRC SHGC values were up to 50% lower than CEN values. Seeing that the SHGC measures the solar radiation transmittance between the exterior and interior surfaces, the height and width of the frame is a significant influence on the amount of solar 60

radiation transmitted through the window where the larger the glazing area the more solar radiation transmission occurs and would therefore contribute to a higher SHGCs. Since much less solar radiation is absorbed and transmitted through the frame, those window units with larger frame surface areas result in a lower SHGC value. This observation is demonstrated in the simulation results where the fiberglass frame NFRC SHGC values had the lowest percentage change in comparison to the CEN values because, out of all the frames, the fiberglass frame had the smallest height (from the sightline to the outer edge of the frame) of 73 mm. The small height of the fiberglass also resulted in larger NFRC SHGC values than the other three frames. The U-PVC frame had the lowest NFRC SHGC values of all the frames; they were slightly lower than the solid wood and TBSW SHGC values, because the height differences between them were minimal. In contrast, the U-PVC frame had the largest height at 122 mm, which was only slightly higher than the solid wood and TBSW frames (117 and 114 mm respectively). Thus, the higher the height of the frame, the larger the frame surface area, the lower the percentage change between the NFRC and CEN SHGC values; and the higher the NFRC SHGC value in comparison to other NFRC SHGC values of different frame types. The high SHGC IGUs had slightly larger percentage change differences for all the frame types; this may be attributed to surface area of the glazing with a higher solar transmittance is referenced in the SHGC calculation is much smaller than the CEN SHGC calculation. Glazing that has lower solar transmittance characteristics, (i.e. low SHGC), is less affected by the decreased surface area when using the NFRC SHGC calculation method. The default height and width of 1000mm was used for both simulation methods for nine glazing IGUs with high and low SHGCs: double IGUs with glass panes, triple IGUs with glass panes, triple IGUs with heat mirrors, quad IGUs with heat mirrors, and a quad IGU with a high SHGC and glass panes. The frame was not included in the SHGC results. The results showed that the NFRC SHGC values were 2-8% higher than CEN values (see Table 32). The double IGUs with a high and low SHGC, as well as the Quad IGU with a low SHGC and heat mirrors, had the largest percentage change whereas the Quad IGU with glass panes had the lowest percentage change between the two methods. The observation of larger differences between both methods with high SHGC IGUs is multifaceted. An IGU with a low SHGC decreases the thermal transmittance of the glazing more efficiently than an IGU with a high SHGC. Portions of long wave radiation are reflected by the low-E layers present on low SHGC glazing. Due to this occurrence, combine with increasing interior and temperature differences, less heat is transferred towards the frame. The frame temperature can thus be lower than for a frame with a high SHGC, depending on the thermal efficiency of the frame. The low-E layer adds more material to the 61

glazing allowing more heat transfer through conduction to place. In addition, more thermal transmittance occurs for the double IGUs at increasing temperature differentials due to the larger gap width size. The larger the gap width size, the more temperature plays a role in increasing the effect of heat transfer through convection. There was a minor discrepancy between the NFRC and CEN SHGC values when the glazing, by itself, was analyzed in the Ucog simulations (see Table 32). In using the default height and width of 1000 mm, and by considering the glazing by itself, this approach narrowed the differences between the NFRC and CEN methods in determining the solar transmittance through the glazing. The primary factors that attribute to these differences are the following boundary conditions: the interior and exterior temperatures, wind speed, and solar irradiance. In the NFRC method, when the exterior temperatures for the SHGC boundary conditions are changed, the center-of-glazing SHGC changes. Increasing the wind speed (and thus the surface film coefficient) to 5 m/s decreases the SHGC by 0.002, wind speeds in the summer are generally very low therefore this factor is negligible. Changing the SHGC exterior temperature in the eight climate zones only results in 00.005 decrease where the greatest change in value only occurs for the lowest summer design temperature of 14Â°C in Iqaluit, however, the SHGC only changes by 0-0.01 when rounded to two decimal places. Likewise, in the CEN method there are minimal changes. With an interior temperature of 20Â°C, EN 673 determines the solar transmittance across a temperature difference of 15K and does not outline summer boundary conditions. For the CEN simulations, the summer boundary conditions outlined in ISO 15099 are used for the SHGC calculations (see Table 22). The NFRC SHGC values were 2-8% higher due to the NFRC's larger interior and exterior temperature difference of 8Â°C, and a higher exterior temperature by 2Â°C (see Table 22). Although the NFRC surface film coefficients are higher than the CEN values and increasing those alone decreases the SHGC value, the effect of the higher NFRC exterior temperature, the greater difference between interior and exterior temperatures, and the greater difference between the interior and exterior surface film coefficients, contribute to the higher NFRC center-of-glazing SHGC values. Furthermore, the NFRC method's higher solar irradiance also contributes to larger NFRC center-ofglazing SHGC values in (i.e. 783 vs 500 W/m2). Lowering the solar irradiance value to 500 W/m2 in the NFRC method in effect lowers the SHGC by 0.01. In addition, raising the wind speed to 4 m/s in the NFRC method lowers the SHGC by 0.004 which is significant when combined with other factors that 62

slightly change the SHGC value (i.e. surface film coefficients). Thus, the cumulative effect of the different irradiances, interior and exterior temperatures and surface film coefficients of both methods, account for the higher NFRC center-of-glazing SHGC values.

5.2 Ucog Simulations
5.2.1 Ucog-NFRC and Ucog-CEN Comparison in the 8 Climate Zones

Double, triple and quad IGUs with high and low SHGCs were simulated within the eight climate zones. The larger differences at 30 and 40Â°C in the CEN method are again due to the different summer boundary conditions, particularly the lower surface film coefficients and higher interior temperature (see Table 22) that were used at those temperatures. To normalize the results, the temperatures that lie 20Â°C and below that used the standard boundary conditions is discussed.

The trend in Figures 34 and 35 shows that the higher the IGU's thermal performance, the less differences that occur between both Ucog methods. This supports the possible harmonization of these methods as discussed in Section 5.7. Examining the heat transfer equations for the Ucog value, the interior and exterior temperature differential is integral in formulating the radiative and convective heat transfer coefficients. The heat transfer coefficients measure the thermal conductance of the gas spacing and glazing materials. Temperature values are placed in the majority of calculations that formulate the heat transfer coefficients, as seen, for example, in the radiation conductance equation, and the Grashof number in the Nusselt equations which are part of the gas conductance equation: the radiation and gas conductance equations form the total thermal conductance of the glazing (CEN, 1997). For windows with double IGUs, the mean temperature difference across the gas space is 15K and the mean temperature is 10Â°C (CEN, 1997) (RDH Building Engineering Ltd., 2014). Thus, a degree incremental change can change the Ucog significantly for each standard. The NFRC method according to ISO 15099 is more detailed than the CEN method in several ways. The external and internal facing surface temperature of each glazing layer is calculated using a meshing sequence at finite intervals (ISO, 2003). Temperature values are integral in the radiative component of the thermal transmittance of the glazing in the NFRC method as well (ISO, 2003). The 15K mean temperature difference between bounding glazing surfaces is also true for double IGU windows in the NFRC method when analyzing the isothermal lines in THERM simulations of this study. Therefore, the different thermal conductivities of the gas infill mixtures slightly contribute to the different Ucog results. 64

See Section 3.6 for further discussion of the impact of temperature on the gas thermal conductivities of each method. Foremost, the different surface film coefficient sets (see Section 3.16); the effect of the exterior and interior temperature boundary conditions (see Section 3.9) upon these sets and upon the material and gas properties of the IGU; and the different Ucog calculation methods, altogether significantly contributes to the difference in the Ucog values of both methods. The IGU combinations were simulated across the climate zone exterior temperature range. The trend showed that the higher the difference between interior and exterior temperatures, the higher the Ucog values. The change in exterior temperature in both calculation methods directly influences the thermal conductivity of the gas infill in the IGU. In addition, the thickness of the layers of the low-E coatings also influences the convective and conductive heat transfer effects of the gas infill (see Section 5.1). This demonstrates the influence of the variances of the exterior and interior boundary condition temperature differences upon the Ucog value of both methods. 5.2.2 Ucog-NFRC in Reference to -18Â°C

The Ucog-NFRC in reference to the NFRC standard temperature of -18Â°C were 16% lower to 34% higher in the exterior temperature range of -40 to 40Â°C. Larger differences occurred at 20Â°C. The double IGU with a high SHGC had the least differences compared with the standard value specific to each IGU, followed by the quad IGU. 5.2.3 Ucog-CEN in Reference to 0Â°C

The Ucog-CEN in reference to the CEN standard temperature of 0Â°C were 29% lower to 51% higher in the exterior temperature range of -40 to 40Â°C. Larger differences were seen at larger temperature differences and with the double IGUs. The least differences occurred for the quad IGU. All of the IGUs in Section 5.2.1 with a lower SHGC had higher differences in Ucog values for both methods due to the increased conductive heat transfer through the presence of more low-E coatings (than high SHGC IGUs), as well as the effect of the various temperatures differences (in the exterior temperature range); where the greater the temperature difference, the greater conductive transfer.

Ucog-NFRC values for the double high SHGC IGU are 5% lower to 4% higher than Ucog-CEN values in the 8 climate zones. Ucog-NFRC values for the double low SHGC IGU are 28% lower to 7% higher than Ucog-CEN values in the 8 climate zones (see Tables D-44 & D-45). Ucog-NFRC values for the triple high SHGC IGU are 6% lower to 6% higher than Ucog-CEN values in the 8 climate zones. Ucog-NFRC values for the triple low SHGC IGU are 6% lower to 3% higher than Ucog-CEN values in the 8 climate zones see (Tables D-46 & D-47).

66

Therefore, the trend shows that for higher performing IGUs the differences in Ucog values for both methods are less. The Ucog-NFRC values ranged from 16% lower to 34% higher than the standard NFRC value in the climate zones for different gap widths (see Tables D-44-D-47). Similarly, Ucog-CEN values ranged from 29% lower to 51% higher than the standard CEN value in the climate zones for different gap widths. Therefore, depending on the climate zone location, the annual average Ucog values for both methods can potentially be 16% lower to 34% higher than an NFRC rated window; and 29% lower to 51% higher for a CEN rated window in North America. The results show that the locations within the climate zones with higher extremes in temperature, in reference to the same interior temperature of 21Â°C, thermal transmittance increases with larger gap widths. Seeing that the larger gap widths entail larger volumes of infill gas, there is more potential for heat transfer to occur through convection and radiation with higher temperature extremes. Therefore, depending on the climate zone location, larger gap widths do not always give lower Ucog values. In effect, there is potential for more variance in gap spacing size within design processes using average annual Ucog values for each climate zone (Speier F. , 2014). The double IGUs showed a slightly greater difference between the two SHGCs than the triple IGUs due to the larger gap spacing size and thus greater thermal transmittance through convection. The IGUs with a low SHGC had greater differences due to increased conduction through the presence of more low-E coatings and their effect on the thermal conductivity of the gas infill. There were negligible differences between the Ucog values of the double IGUs for both methods. For the triple IGUs, the largest percentage change between both methods occurs in climate zones 7 and 8 with gap widths from 14-20 mm due to larger gap widths and larger interior and exterior temperature differences result in increased conductive and radiative heat transfer.

5.3 Uframe Simulations
5.3.1 Uframe-NFRC, Uframe-CEN and UframeIGU-CEN Calculation Methods The results showed that the Uframe-NFRC values are 7% lower to 1% higher than the Uframe-CEN values with the IGU for all the frames. The trend showed that greater differences in Uframe-CEN values of both methods occurred for the solid wood and TBSW compared with the U-PVC and fiberglass frames (see Figures 15-18). The greater the length of the sightline to the edge of the frame, and the greater the frame width, the greater the differences in Uframe-CEN values (See Table 39 and Section 5.5 for further 67

discussion). Different thermal conductivities, frame cavity methods, surface film coefficients and calculation methods contribute to the variation in values. The different exterior temperatures of both methods do not impact the Uframe seeing that the results showed that Uframe did not change between the temperatures of -40 to 40Â°C.

Figure 18 Solid Wood Frame: Uframe-NFRC vs Uframe-CEN and UframeIGU-CEN

Although Uframe-CEN and UframeIGU-CEN (from Equation 8) are modeled differently, UframeIGU-CEN is typically higher than Uframe-CEN. UframeIGU-CEN is higher because it is determined using the actual glazing insert which includes the thermal transmittance effects of the glazing and spacer (which typically contain

69

materials with a higher thermal conductivity). That in effect raises the thermal transmittance of the frame. Whereas the Uframe-CEN is typically lower since it uses a calibration panel with a very low thermal conductivity (i.e. 0.035 W/mK). For high performance glazing and spacers, the NFRC and CEN Uframe values with the IGU would be more similar, since there is less heat transfer interactions taking place from the frame towards the spacer and glazing than a lower performing window unit. The primary differences here are in the boundary conditions, such as, the edge effects lengths are 65 and 190 mm for the NFRC and CEN methods respectively and different surface film coefficients. Overall, the Uframe-CEN can give a fair comparison of frames due to the use of a calibration panel, which also allows for various IGU combinations to be compared and the incremental effect of their thermal performance can be measured when combined with the frame. Uframe-CEN thus gives a more in depth picture of the thermal interactions that are responsible for the degree of differences between both methods. 5.3.2 Uframe-CEN with CEN and NFRC Frame Cavity Methods Seeing that the Uframe-CEN method gives the thermal transmittance value of the frame without the influence of the IGU, the Uframe-CEN method was used to simulate the four frame types with different boundary conditions. The effect of using different frame cavity methods, thermal conductivities and surface film coefficients were simulated with triple IGUs with a high SHGC and Spacer C. The results showed that using the CEN frame cavity method gave Uframe-CEN values that were 3% lower to 4% higher than the Uframe-CEN using the NFRC frame cavity method (see Figure 19). For the fiberglass head and sill simulations there was no change in Uframe-CEN values. The TBSW and solid wood frames ranged from 0-3% percentage change between the two methods. The U-PVC frame showed the larger percentage change out of all the frames at 4% higher Uframe-CEN value than when using the NFRC frame cavity method.

Figure 19 CEN Uframe: CEN vs NFRC Frame Cavity Methods (FCM)

Considering that the CEN frame cavity method takes into account the surface temperatures of each side of a rectangular cavity, the thermal conductivity of more surfaces are taken into account. Structural reinforcement, such as galvanized steel, with a 62 W/mK thermal conductivity, compared with U-PVC's lower conductivity of 17 W/mK, can contribute to increased heat flows in the frame cavities when all surfaces are considered. The NFRC frame cavity method only takes into account two facing frame cavity surface temperatures, therefore, higher conductive materials surrounding the frame cavities have a slightly less effect on the frame's thermal transmittance. The TBSW frame had the second highest percentage change and this may be due to the effect of the oxidized aluminum siding placed on the exterior, with a thermal conductivity of 237 W/mK. This high thermal conductivity influences the thermal transmittance in the frame cavity areas next to it, however, the extremely low conductivity of the insulation foam and EPDM efficiently reduce the impact of the aluminum's conductivity upon the entire frame. The fiberglass frame had no percentage change between the two methods for the head and sill due to the low thermal conductivity of fiberglass, U-PVC and weather stripping components, combined with insulation foam which has an extremely low conductivity (see Section 3.15). The placement of the insulation foam and other components with a low thermal conductivity impedes the thermal transmittance across frame cavities from various directions, thus stabilizing frame cavity surface temperatures. The CEN frame cavity method gave a 3% lower Uframe-CEN value than the NFRC frame 71

cavity method for the jamb due to the effect of gravity and the frame cavity configuration within the jamb. The frame cavities are elongated in the downward direction, which is the same direction as the heat flow and gravity. Therefore, since air at a lower temperature in the frame cavities sinks with the gravitational pull, and that the NFRC method only accounts for the two surface temperatures, there is a slightly higher temperature differential between the top and bottom of the jamb. The solid wood frame had 0-1% differences between the two methods since there are a minimal number of frame cavities and their size is extremely small. Overall, when comparing the Uframe-CEN values for all of the frame types with a calibration panel, the TBSW frame had the lowest U-value and in ascending order, the fiberglass, U-PVC and solid wood frames (see Figures 20 & 21). Without the influence of the thermal interactions of the actual IGU, this Uframe-CEN value allows for a fairer comparison between the frame types than when the IGU is included.

5.3.3 Uframe-CEN Comparison with CEN and NFRC Surface Film Coefficients The surface film coefficients, which combine convection and radiation, have a large impact on the UframeCEN.

As stated in Section 3.16, the CEN method includes the radiation and convective components in the

surface film coefficient values, whereas the NFRC method does not include the radiation component, as it is included in the radiation model in the simulations. Therefore, when replacing CEN surface film coefficients with NFRC values, the radiation component is being neglected and thus this is only a theoretical scenario. However, this was an experiment to investigate how different surface film coefficient values impacted the Uframe-CEN values. The different surface film coefficients used in the NFRC and CEN methods had a large impact on the Uframe-CEN values. The Uframe-CEN values were 19-34% higher than the Uframe-CEN values using the NFRC surface film coefficients. The largest impact in descending order was for the solid wood, U-PVC, fiberglass and TBSW frames. The effect of different surface film coefficients upon Uframe-CEN values depends upon the thermal performance of the frame. The results showed that the higher the thermal performance of the frame, the less of an impact that the surface film coefficients had upon Uframe-CEN. The NFRC surface film coefficients had the most impact on the UPVC frame and the least impact on the TBSW frame due to its higher thermal performance. 5.3.4 Uframe-CEN of Four Frame Types with a Calibration Panel To rate the four frame types from the least to the most conductive, Uframe-CEN simulations were conducted. Figure 22 shows that the TBSW frame is the least conductive and in ascending order;

73

fiberglass, U-PVC and solid wood. The solid wood sill simulations were slightly more conductive than the other frames, due to the longer length of the sightline to the edge of the frame.

Uframe-CEN Comparisons with Various Material Thermal Conductivities

Uframe-CEN comparisons were conducted for the fiberglass, TBSW and solid wood frames with a calibration panel for the frames that fit a triple IGU (see Figure 23). These simulations demonstrate the effect of different thermal conductivities of the frame materials on the Uframe-CEN. Using CEN thermal conductivities for softwood for the TBSW frame resulted in 5% higher Uframe-CEN values than values with NFRC thermal conductivities. The solid wood Uframe-CEN values were 10-11% higher than U-frame values using NFRC thermal conductivities. Different thermal conductivities of the frame material result in a 5-11% difference for softwood materials (see Figure 23). The Uframe-CEN values for the fiberglass frame showed that the higher NFRC thermal conductivity for fiberglass gave 9% higher Uframe-CEN values than when the CEN thermal conductivity values was used.

5.4.1 Uwindow-NFRC and Uwindow-CEN Standard Comparison All of the window configurations, listed in Section 3.5, were simulated using Spacer C in the standard CEN and NFRC methods. Results from the SHGC, Ucog and Uframe simulations in Sections 5.1-5.3 were utilized to aid in the explanation of the Uwindow results found in this section. As a result of simulations performed in Sections 5.5 and 5.6.4, Spacer C was the highest performing spacer and was thus chosen for the Uwindow comparisons. It is acknowledged that using Spacers A and B in all of the Uwindow simulations would give different results. This is beyond the scope of this research. The quad IGU was only simulated with the TBSW frame as per the manufacturer's specifications since it is not typically installed in other frame types.

For the TBSW frame, the Uwindow-NFRC value results were 1% lower to 8% higher than Uwindow-CEN values The IGUs with a low SHGC showed the greater differences between the methods (see Figure 24 and Table B42). The Uwindow-NFRC values for the double and triple IGU combinations with the solid wood frame were 1% lower to 3% higher than CEN values (see Figure 25 and Table B-42). The lower Uwindow-NFRC values are attributed to the lower NFRC thermal conductivity (see Section 3.15). The higher Uwindow-NFRC values are attributed to the influence of higher Ucog-NFRC values (see Table 37) and the weighting of the Ucog value in the Uwindow-NFRC calculation method.

Figure 27 U-PVC Frame: NFRC and CEN Uwindow Values (Percentage Change)

The Uwindow-NFRC values range from 1% lower to 6% higher for the triple and quad high performance window combinations. For all of the frame types, the trend shows that Uwindow-NFRC values are primarily larger than Uwindow-CEN values for most of the IGU combinations and the differences between both methods decrease as the thermal performance of the IGU improves. Therefore, the methods can be harmonized for higher performing frames and IGUs. The greater differences seen in the double IGU combinations suggest that the differences in Ucog procedures are accentuated in lower performing window combinations. Since the Ucog is highly variable with the exterior temperatures and are increasingly variable with larger temperature differences between the interior and exterior environments, the longer the length of the sightline to the edge of the frame, the lesser the differences that occur between the NFRC and CEN Uwindow values. The solid wood frame had the highest conductivity, and in descending order: U-PVC, fiberglass and TBSW (see Section 5.3.4). This occurrence is partially due to the thermal interactions of the higher IGU U-value transferring to the frame. The larger frame surface area and width of the solid wood frame (see Table 39) contributes more conductive heat transfer through the frame. Therefore, the discrepancies in Ucog NFRC and CEN values are reduced by the thermal interactions of the IGU being transferred through the frame. Although the TBSW frame is less conductive than the fiberglass frame, the TBSW frame had lesser differences between both methods due to the longer length from the sightline to the edge of the frame. Again, the transfer of the thermal interactions of the IGU is less effective the longer the length of the high performance frame between the sightline and frame edge. Out of all the frames simulated, the fiberglass frame showed the larger differences where Uwindow-NFRC values were between 5-11% higher than CEN values. From the thermal conductivity comparative results

77

of both methods for fiberglass frames in Section 5.3.4, it would be assumed that the Uwindow-NFRC results would be lower than the CEN values given CEN's lower thermal conductivity for fiberglass (i.e. 0.3 vs 0.4 W/mK). However, since the NFRC values are higher, other boundary conditions are influential here. Specifically, the different exterior temperatures, surface film coefficients, frame cavity and center-ofglazing approaches specific to each method all contribute to the discrepancies in the Uwindow results. The result of changing CEN simulation's exterior temperature to the NFRC value of -18Â°C (see Table B43), was an Uwindow-NFRC value that was 1% higher than the CEN value for the double IGUs and a 2% lower value for the triple IGUs. Therefore, for the double IGUs, the difference in exterior temperatures used in both methods gives a minimal contribution to a higher Uwindow-NFRC value. For the triple IGUs, the difference in exterior temperatures slightly lowers the Uwindow-NFRC value and thus doesn't explain the higher NFRC values. The effect of using different surface film coefficients of both methods does not explain the higher Uwindow-NFRC values. The surface film coefficient comparative results show that for the fiberglass frame, the Uwindow-NFRC values were 4-5% lower than the Uwindow-NFRC values using CEN surface film coefficients. Therefore, the effect of using different surface film coefficients of both methods does not explain the higher Uwindow-NFRC values. See Section 5.4.3 for further discussion. From the frame cavity method comparison results (see Section 5.4.4), the Uwindow-NFRC values of the fiberglass frame combinations were 1% higher than the NFRC values using the CEN frame cavity method. The Uwindow-CEN values were 1% lower than when using the NFRC frame cavity method. Similarly, the Uframe-CEN frame cavity method comparison isolated the effect of the different frame cavity methods on the frame by itself, and the results showed that for a triple IGU with a high SHGC, the Uwindow-NFRC value for the jamb was 3% higher than the Uwindow-CEN value. Thus, there is a slight difference between the frame cavity methods and this difference does contribute slightly to the higher Uwindow-NFRC values. The center-of-glazing approaches of both methods yields results where the Ucog-NFRC values of the IGUs used in this study were found to be 11-22% higher than Ucog-CEN (see Table 37). The larger differences were seen for the IGUs with a low SHGC due to the presence of higher conductive low-E coatings (see Section 5.2.1 for further discussion). Seeing that the glazing constitutes the majority of the window area and, in addition, is a large component of the thermal transmittance calculations, the thermal transmittance of the glazing is integral and highly influential in the final Uwindow value. The higher UcogNFRC values

significantly lowers the Uwindow values and thus explains and largely accounts for the higher 78

Uwindow-NFRC values for the fiberglass frame and IGU combinations. The potential effect of the thermal conductivity differences between both methods will be discussed further.

Although the NFRC Ucog-NFRC values for the double and triple IGUs were considerably higher than the CEN values, the higher performing triple IGUs had less of an impact on the Uwindow value than the double IGUs. Lower performing insulated glazing units influence the thermal transmittance of the frame if the frame is poorly insulated. If the frame is well insulated, it improves Uwindow by impeding the thermal transmittance from the glazing to the frame which could further lower a poorly insulated frame. 5.4.2 Uwindow-NFRC and Uwindow-CEN with Various Material Thermal Conductivities

The Uwindow-NFRC values of the fiberglass frames with the double and triple IGUs were compared using the NFRC and CEN thermal conductivity values of 0.3 and 0.4 W/mK. All simulations used Spacer C. Using the NFRC thermal conductivity resulted in 2-3% lower Uwindow-NFRC values than Uwindow-NFRC values when the CEN thermal conductivity was used. These results show that harmonizing the fiberglass thermal conductivity values, by utilizing the NFRC value (for example) for both methods, will result in 2-3% lower Uwindow-CEN values. This drop in values would accentuate the differences in Uwindow-NFRC and Uwindow-CEN values seen in Figure 28. Although using the same material thermal conductivities would accentuate the differences in Uwindow values of both methods, it is important to use the same thermal conductivities for a material and focus on other influential parameters in order to harmonize the two methods.

For the solid wood frame, Uwindow-NFRC values, with the NFRC thermal conductivity for softwood, were 46% lower than when using the CEN thermal conductivity. The percentage change is higher than for the TBSW frame due to the larger area of solid wood within the frame (See Figure 30).

Overall, using thermal conductivities that are 15-25% higher in each method can potentially give 2-6% lower Uwindow-NFRC values (see Table 38). Harmonizing the thermal conductivity values of both methods results in lower Uwindow-NFRC values; whereby the magnitude of the increase is dependent upon the increase in thermal conductivity and the area of that material within the frame. When identical thermal conductivities are used in both methods, the differences in Uwindow values are analogous for the TBSW and solid wood frames (see Figures 29 & 30). The differences are less for the TBSW frame due to the less volume of solid wood and the use of lower conductive insulation foam, EPDM and frame cavities, which function as a thermal break between the higher conductive solid wood and aluminum siding. The TBSW frame also does not expose the solid wood to the exterior environment and is thus the other materials mentioned serve as a protective thermal barrier. Seeing that there are lesser differences in the higher performing frames, this supports the possibility of harmonizing the material thermal conductivities of both methods.

The largest discrepancy for all the window combinations and frame types was for the double IGUs; particularly the double IGU combinations with a high SHGC due to the effect of the different interior and exterior temperature boundary conditions. The trend showed that there are greater differences in the Uwindow values of both methods for the most conductive frame, i.e. solid wood. For the remaining three frames, the deeper the inset of the IGU (i.e. sightline to the bottom of the IGU), and the longer the length between the sightline to the edge of the frame, as well as the conductivity of the frame components all contribute to the lower differences in Uwindow values between both methods. Overall, the NFRC method's lower surface film coefficient values result in lower Uwindow-CEN values. Larger discrepancies were seen in the CEN simulations due to the omissions of the radiation component in the NFRC surface film coefficient sets as stated in Section 3.16. 5.4.4 Uwindow-NFRC and Uwindow-CEN using NFRC and CEN Frame Cavity Methods The Uwindow-NFRC value using the NFRC frame cavity method is 1% lower to 1% higher than the Uwindow-NFRC values that use the CEN frame cavity method for all of the frames. For the fiberglass frame simulations with double and triple IGUs, the Uwindow-NFRC values when using the NFRC frame cavity method were all 1% higher than the NFRC values using the CEN frame cavity method. There was no change in Uwindow-NFRC values using both frame cavity methods for the TBSW and solid wood frames. The U-PVC Uwindow-NFRC values using the NFRC frame cavity method were 1% lower than values using the CEN frame cavity method (see Figure 37). There are thus negligible differences between both frame cavity methods when using the NFRC method. This supports the harmonization of the frame cavity procedures of both the NFRC and CEN methods.

The Uwindow-CEN value using the CEN frame cavity method is 1% lower to 3% higher than the Uwindow-CEN values that use the NFRC frame cavity method for all the frames. All of the TBSW frame combinations and the double IGU solid wood simulations showed no difference in Uwindow values. The triple IGU solid wood frame Uwindow-CEN values were 1% higher than CEN values using the NFRC frame cavity method. The Uwindow-CEN values for the fiberglass frame combinations were 1% lower than the Uwindow-CEN values using the NFRC frame cavity method. The Uwindow-CEN values of the U-PVC frame combinations were 2-3% higher than the values using the NFRC frame cavity method; the triple IGU combination showed the higher results (see Figure 38). The U-PVC frame had the larger differences since it has the most frame cavities out of all the frames. Since the NFRC frame cavity method only considers two surfaces in the direction of the heat flow, there is a slightly larger difference between the frame cavity surface temperatures which result in a higher Uwindow-CEN value (see Section 3.18). Overall, the two frame cavity methods produce negligible differences in Uwindow for all frame types and thus amalgamating this parameter supports the harmonization of these methods.

Spacer C had the lowest -values and Spacer A had the largest -values across the temperature range of -40 to 40Â°C for all window combinations. There were no significant changes of the -values between -40 to 15Â°C. As stated before, the largest -values were at 30 and 40Â°C due to the CEN summer boundary conditions used for those two temperatures.

Figure 59 -Values of TBSW Frame with Triple IGUs (Percentage Change)

For all frame and glazing combinations, the -values fell in the range of 0.02-0.045 W/mK. The IGUs with a low SHGC had slightly higher -values than the IGUs with a high SHGC. The double IGUs showed a slightly greater difference between the two SHGCs than the triple IGUs due to the larger gap spacing size and thus greater thermal transmittance through convection. The IGUs with a low SHGC had a larger -value than the low SHGC IGUs (below 15Â°C) due to increased conduction through the low-E coatings on the low SHGC IGUs (see Section 5.2.1). At 30Â°C, the -values of the high SHGC IGUs are larger than the low SHGC IGUs due to the higher exterior temperature and thus higher difference in interior and exterior temperatures. In comparing the different frame types, the U-PVC frame had the lowest -values across the exterior temperature range, and in ascending order; the fiberglass, solid wood and TBSW. The TBSW frame with

94

the quad IGU had the lowest -values out of all of the window combinations. There is negligible difference between the high and low SHGC IGUs. Out of all of the frame types, the U-PVC had the lowest -values (see Figure 55). The discrepancies in -values, primarily the double IGUs, occurred at the exterior temperatures of 30 and 40Â°C due to the lower surface film coefficients used in the summer design conditions of the CEN method and the effect of the lower surface film coefficients in producing higher Ucog values. The larger gap size in the double IGU also contributed to the higher Ucog values and thus the trend of higher thermal transmittance. The effects of the increased thermal transmittance of the glazing upon the spacer and frame materials is reflected and measured in the larger -values found at 30 and 40Â°C. The -value highlights the intricate thermal interactions between the glazing, spacer and frame materials and thus gives more detailed information as to the thermal efficiency of various glazing, spacer and frame type combinations. In addition, the thermal interactions highlighted by the -value aids in the explanation of how these interactions are affected by individual window components and the differences of the NFRC and CEN method in determining the overall and individual component thermal transmittance. The triple and quad IGU combinations with all of the frame types showed the least variation in U-values across the exterior temperature range as well as between the high and low SHGC IGUs (see Section 5.6.1). Thus, the higher thermally performing IGUs and frames had zero to little variation in linear thermal transmittance across the temperature range. The U-PVC frame simulations had the lowest -values across the exterior temperature range. This is expected seeing that the Uwindow-CEN results showed that the U-PVC frame had a higher Uframe value than the other frame types; the higher rate of heat loss through the U-PVC frame (see Section 5.3.4), area results in a lower linear thermal transmittance. The lower -values are plausible considering that the distance from the sightline to the bottom of the IGU is the longest for the U-PVC frame, this demonstrates that the deeper inset position of the IGU in the frame minimizes the linear thermal transmittance. Furthermore, the distance from the sightline to the edge of the interior side of the UPVC frame is longer than the other frames; this in conjunction with air cavities that have a very low conductivity aids in the minimization of the thermal interactions of the glazing and spacer throughout the frame (see Table 39).

95

Although solid wood has a slightly lower conductivity (NFRC 0.11 W/mK, CEN 0.13 W/mK) than U-PVC (0.17 W/mK), the solid wood frame -values were higher than the other frames. There are several reasons that explicate why there is more thermal transmittance in the solid wood frame. The solid wood frame has the longest distance from the sightline to the edge of the frame nearer to the exterior side which subjects more surface area of the frame to external conditions; this in conjunction with the solid wood composition of the frame with minimal air cavities leads to potentially more thermal transmittance through conduction, given the higher conductivity of softwood than air cavities. The IGU for the solid wood frame also has the shortest inset into the frame (sightline to bottom of IGU is 12 mm); this shallow inset subjects more of the IGU to the external environmental which leads to increased thermal interactions occurring through the spacer and frame.

The -value results are in line with the spacer comparative results for the Uwindow value. Simulations that used Spacer C resulted in the lowest -value due to the low thermal conductivity of the constituent materials. Spacer B performed higher than Spacer A due to the smaller height of the spacer which allowed more 90% krypton and 10% air gas infill for the IGU. The greater volume of extremely low thermal conductivity of the gas infill gave the windows with Spacer B a lower -value.

5.6 Uwindow Simulations in the 8 Climate Zones
5.6.1 Uwindow-NFRC and Uwindow-CEN Comparison in the 8 Climate Zones

NFRC and CEN Uwindow values of several IGU and frame types were compared across the temperature range of -40 to 40Â°C for the eight climate zones (see Figures 60-67). The results from the SHGC, Ucog, Uframe, Uwindow and -value simulations in Sections 5.1-5.6 were used to elucidate the results found in the 96

Uwindow values in the eight climate zones in Section 5.6. Spacer C was used in all simulations unless otherwise noted. The annual average temperature ranges of the eight climate zones were highlighted (see Section 3.11). [Note: the 20Â°C is omitted because 20Â°C for NFRC and 15Â°C for CEN since THERM does not calculate the U-value for a 0Â°C temperature difference.]

Figure 67 Triple IGU Solid Wood Frame: Uwindow Values in 8 Climate Zones (Percentage Change)

Overall, the Uwindow-NFRC values were 8% lower to 4% higher than Uwindow-CEN values for all of the exterior temperatures. The trend of percentage changes is higher for frames with a longer length (i.e. sightline to edge of frame); the solid wood frame has higher percentage changes than the TBSW, fiberglass and U-PVC (lowest) frames. As discussed in Section 5.3.2, the length and area of the frame (i.e. sightline to edge of frame) influence the magnitude of the differences between both methods whereby frames with larger lengths have 100

greater exposure exterior environment and are thus more sensitive to exterior temperature changes within the climate zones. The solid wood frame has the largest exterior length and combined with conductive heat transfer through the solid wood and the absence of insulative frame cavities, larger differences in Uwindow values between methods occur. All of the Uwindow values for the exterior temperatures of 30 and 40Â°C were the same for the CEN simulations; whereas the values were different for the NFRC simulations due to the effect of the summer boundary conditions on the different Ucog values. For the fiberglass and U-PVC frames with triple IGUs, the 4% higher CEN than NFRC Uwindow value may be attributed to the temperature differential between the interior and exterior for the CEN method. The largest temperature difference between the interior and exterior temperature (i.e. 20 and 0Â°C) occurs at 10Â°C. Since the Uvalues-CEN measure the thermal transmittance at those temperatures, the fluctuations in Uwindow values are in reference to that temperature and thus differentiate from the NFRC values accordingly. The TBSW frame Uwindow values were the lowest out of all the frames. The larger differences between both methods occur for the TBSW frame with the higher performing IGUs; this is logical as the thermal performance of the frame plays a more extensive role as the efficiency of the IGU's thermal performance increases. The lower Uwindow-NFRC value is also attributed to the lower thermal conductivity value of softwood that is used in the NFRC method. The lower thermal conductivity of the softwood is ameliorated by the foam insulation, which is placed between the aluminum siding and the softwood. Heat transfer from the softwood to the exterior and heat transfer from the exterior environment towards the interior through the highly conductive aluminum is abated by the foam insulation. This explicates the lower thermal transmittance of the TBSW frame. For all of the CEN simulations, the Uwindow and Ucog values (with a high and low SHGC) for 30 and 40Â°C were the same whereas the NFRC had different values for each temperature. The lack of change in the Ucog-CEN at these temperatures accounts for the variations between the U-values of both methods. The reason as to why there is a lack of change at these temperatures is presently unknown at the time of this study; however, some problem areas that may contribute to this finding are identified in Section 11. The largest differences between both methods across the -40 to 40Â°C temperature range were found in the solid wood frame double and triple IGU simulations. The NFRC values were all lower than the CEN values. Considering that the frame is composed of softwood, any change in thermal conductivity values 101

would affect the thermal transmittance of the whole frame. Since the NFRC thermal conductivity of softwood is lower than the CEN value, this lower value accounts for the lower Uwindow-NFRC results. The thickness and width of the frame also accounts for the lower Uwindow-NFRC results since the NFRC calculation method is area-weighted, the larger frame area has a heavier weighting in the final Uwindow result. Foremost, given that the material conductivity does not change with a change in exterior temperature, the change in exterior temperature in both calculation methods directly influences the thermal conductivity of the gas infill in the IGU. In addition, the thickness of the layers of the low-E coatings also influences the convective and conductive heat transfer effects of the gas infill. The heat transfer effects within the IGU are filtered through the spacer and frame materials and frame cavities. Since the Ucog and Uframe are the main components of the U-value calculations, the interior and exterior temperature difference influences the whole Uwindow value and thus explains some of the differences in Uwindow values for both methods. In conjunction with the results in Section 5.6.4, the average annual high and low temperature range for each location is not necessary for high performance windows seeing that there were insignificant differences in Uwindow across each range. Therefore, the average annual temperature would suffice to obtain the climate specific Uwindow value for each location.

5.6.2

Uwindow-NFRC Comparison in Reference to -18Â°C

Uwindow-NFRC values were compared in reference to the standard boundary condition of -18Â°C, in the -40 to 40Â°C exterior temperature range. These values give an indication as to the degree of change in UwindowNFRC

across the aforementioned temperature range.

Table 40 Uwindow-NFRC Comparison in Reference to -18Â°C

Frame Type and IGU

Exterior Temps in reference to -18Â°C

Fiberglass Double 9% lower - 15% higher Triple 7% lower - 14% higher

TBSW Double 5% lower - 14% higher Triple 6% lower - 12% higher Quad 5% lower - 5% higher Solid Wood Double 6% lower - 10% higher Triple 5% lower to 7% higher U-PVC Double 6% lower to 8% higher Triple 4% lower to 6% higher

The trend is that the higher the IGU thermal performance, the less difference in Uwindow values of both methods. The largest difference in Uwindow-NFRC values, in relation to the NFRC exterior temperature boundary condition of -18Â°C, occurs at 20Â°C, then -40Â°C in descending order, due to the influence of the 21Â°C interior temperature boundary condition. The temperature difference is analogous to the difference in Uwindow values as the temperature increases or decreases from -18Â°C. Above 21Â°C, the difference in U-values decreases due to the proximity of the exterior temperature to the summer interior design temperature. These observances take place for all of the frame types and IGU combinations. 5.6.3 Uwindow-CEN Values Comparison in Reference to 0Â°C

Uwindow-CEN values were compared in reference to the standard boundary condition of 0Â°C, in the -40 to 40Â°C exterior temperature range. These values give an indication as to the degree of change in UwindowCEN

across the aforementioned temperature range.

For both methods across the -40 to 40Â°C temperature range, the Uwindow-NFRC values were 2-15% higher than the NFRC standard values; and the Uwindow-CEN values were 15% lower to 2% higher than the CEN standard values. Higher value differences than standard values for both methods occurred for several IGUs with a low SHGC for all frame types; the double IGUs showed the greater differences compared to the triple IGUs (see Section 5.2.1 for further discussion). These results show how the interior and exterior temperature differential affects the Uwindow value, as well as the shift in percentage change in relation to the difference in standard exterior (-18 vs 0Â°C) and interior temperatures (21 vs 20Â°C) for each method. Examining the effect of exterior temperature changes upon the Uwindow value for both methods shows primarily the impact of the thermal transmittance of the glazing and its effect on the thermal transmittance of the whole window. Seeing that the glazing variable is a large component of the Uwindow calculation for both methods; the glazing area magnifies the influence of the glazing upon the Uwindow value (see Section 5.4.3 for further discussion). The difference in Uwindow values is highly significant, especially in cases where the winter design temperatures of each climate zone location are considered: in climate zones 1-5 the winter design temperatures do not reach below -18Â°C and in zones 7 and 8, the winter design temperatures are between -30 and -40Â°C in some locations. Foremost, the greater difference between interior and exterior temperatures leads to larger discrepancies in Uwindow values.

104

Since the average Uwindow values give a better indication as to the thermal transmittance that is actually being achieved in each climate zone, the climate specific Uwindow values (between -10 and 30Â°C) for the high performance windows (i.e. frames with triple and quad IGUs) are approximately 0-14% higher than the standard NFRC value and 7% lower to 2% higher than the CEN standard values. This suggests that a window in Albuquerque, Yellowknife or Toronto, may potentially have a U-value of up to 14% higher than the standard rated Uwindow-NFRC for the majority of the year. A window with a Uwindow-CEN value would have a lower variation in U-values than the Uwindow-NFRC values across the annual average temperatures of the eight climate zones. The lower variation could be interpreted as a more efficient window, however, that is not the case seeing that the only differences between the aforementioned Uwindow values are the calculation methods and the proximity of the climate zone annual average temperatures to the standard exterior temperature; i.e. 0Â°C (CEN) is closer than -18Â°C (NFRC) to the climate zone annual average temperature range between -10 and 30Â°C. In addition, the Ucog standard NFRC values at the exterior temperature of -18Â°C do not reflect the UcogNFRC values

when considering the annual average temperatures of the eight climate zones. As seen in the

results, Ucog-NFRC values are up to 28% higher than the standard value. Given that Ucog-NFRC values are sensitive to exterior temperature changes, there is a need for climate specific ratings for individual glazing products; this information would be beneficial for window design manufacturers. This variation of Uwindow and Ucog values purports the need for an international standardized method, as well as climate specific U-values when calculating a building's annual energy use intensity. 5.6.4 Uwindow-NFRC and Uwindow-CEN Comparison with 3 Spacer Types

Spacers A, B and C were simulated in the double, triple and quad IGUs with a high SHGC for all of the frame types in the NFRC and CEN Uwindow calculation methods (see Figures 68-71, D81-D83). The annual average high and low temperature ranges for the eight climate zones range from -9Â°C in Yellowknife to 29Â°C in Miami. The winter design temperatures, of the eight climate zones, range from -40Â°C in Yellowknife to 11Â°C in Miami. The winter design temperatures of locations in climate zones 1-5 all lie above the winter design temperature of -18Â°C as designated by the NFRC as the standard exterior temperature for North America. The winter design temperatures of locations in climate zones 7-8 range from -30 to -40Â°C and thus lie well below the NFRC winter design temperature. Thus, the winter design temperature is not representative of all the locations within each climate zone. The variations in climate 105

and topographical conditions in different locations within each climate zone are unique and should be considered in design strategies. It is important to note that the locations identified within each climate zone only give an impression of a region in that climate zone and they do not represent every location within the same climate zone; it is recognized that there are variations, slight to moderate between locations within each climate zone. The fiberglass frame with a double IGU where the three spacers were compared had results where the differences between each spacer were minimal across the exterior temperatures of -40 to 40Â°C. Across the annual average high and low temperatures of the eight climate zone locations (i.e. -10 to 30Â°C), the NFRC simulations with: a) Spacer C ranges from 1.51 to 1.59 W/mÂ²K b) Spacer A ranges from 1.53 to 1.6 W/mÂ²K c) Spacer B ranges from 1.52 to 1.59 W/mÂ²K The lowest Uwindow-NFRC values occurred near 20Â°C and the highest Uwindow-NFRC value occurred near -10Â°C due to their proximity to the NFRC standard interior temperature of 21Â°C. Generally, the trend shows that the larger the difference in temperature between the interior and exterior, the higher the resulting Uwindow-NFRC value. The Spacer A simulation at 30Â°C gave a higher Uwindow-NFRC value due to the higher interior temperature used for the summer boundary conditions. For the fiberglass frame with a double IGU and a high SHGC the range of Uwindow-NFRC values are as follows: Spacer C 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Miami, 21-29Â°C Austin, 14-16Â°C Atlanta, 11-22Â°C Albuquerque, 7-20Â°C Indianapolis, 6-17Â°C Toronto, 5-13Â°C Winnipeg, -3-8Â°C Yellowknife, -9-0Â°C 1.51-1.59 1.51-1.52 1.51-1.52 1.51-1.53 1.51-1.53 1.52-1.53 1.52-1.55 1.54-1.58 Spacer A 1.53-1.58 1.53-1.55 1.53-1.55 1.53-1.55 1.53-1.55 1.55 1.55-1.57 1.56-1.6 Spacer B 1.52-1.57 1.52-1.53 1.52-1.53 1.52-1.53 1.52-1.54 1.53-1.54 1.53-1.56 1.55-1.59

As stated in Section 5.6.1, there were no significant differences (0-5%) in Uwindow-NFRC across the annual average high and low temperature ranges for each location. Therefore, the average annual temperature for each location is sufficient to account for the climate specific U-value.

107

The differences in Uwindow values between each spacer are minute. Out of the three spacers, Spacer C gave the lowest Uwindow value and Spacer A gave the highest Uwindow values in these simulations. Spacer C had a slightly higher thermal performance than Spacer A given that their height is identical, 12 mm. In Spacer C, the material adjacent to the gas infill contributed to its higher performance due to its lower thermal conductivity (i.e. 0.2 W/mK) than Spacer A and B (i.e. 0.19 and 4.6 W/mK respectively). Spacer B has a slightly higher thermal performance than Spacer C despite the metal component (4.6 W/mK). This is due to its smaller height of 7.874 mm which allows for a slightly larger volume of the krypton/air gas infill which has an extremely low conductivity; lower than the spacer. The CEN values increase from 0 and 20Â°C because those are the interior and exterior temperature boundary conditions. The NFRC values increase from 21Â°C because that is the interior temperature boundary condition and the exterior temperature boundary condition allows for a greater range and does not influence the incremental change in Uwindow-CEN values at 0Â°C. In comparing the three spacer products, there were no significant differences (up to 5%) between the NFRC and CEN Uwindow values for the fiberglass and U-PVC frame types. The Uwindow-NFRC values were generally slightly lower than CEN values. For the majority of the frame types and IGUs, Spacer C had the lowest conductivity out of all of the spacers and this information was used to justify the use of Spacer C in the simulations that required one spacer type (i.e. Sections 5.2.1-5.2.5). The lower conductivity of Spacer C minimized the influence of the spacer on the frame and IGU components upon Uwindow values; this aided the focused examination of the frame and IGU components. There were only slightly higher Uwindow-NFRC values in the double IGU combination with the fiberglass frame. This slight increase in Uwindow-NFRC value is due to the additional thermal transmittance that occurs with the double IGU in comparison to the triple and quad IGUs. The double IGU has a higher thermal transmittance as the difference in exterior temperature from -18Â°C increases to -40Â°C; thus the larger increase in Uwindow-NFRC occurs at -40Â°C. Overall, this increase is minor compared to the CEN values. The TBSW frames with double, triple and quad IGUs showed relatively lower Uwindow-NFRC values than CEN values; up to 7% higher than CEN values. The higher difference in percentage changes were found at 30Â°C due to the same Ucog-CEN value given and the summer boundary conditions used in the CEN method for 30 and 40Â°C. For the quad IGU simulations the two spacers showed no change in the percentage difference between the CEN and NFRC methods between the -40 and 10Â°C temperature range. The results for 30 and 40Â°C 108

showed a greater difference for simulations with Spacer C. Overall, the Uwindow-NFRC values were lower than the CEN values. Spacer C simulations showed a Uwindow-NFRC value range of .663-.731 and Spacer A showed a range of .685-.749 W/mÂ²K. The results show that the higher the thermal performance of the glazing, the more significant the role of the thermal characteristics of the frame and spacers. In addition, the higher the thermal performance of the spacer also accentuates the thermal performance characteristics of the frame, allowing for the clearer identification of these characteristics. For example, the Uwindow values with Spacer C were the lowest and showed the greatest differences between both methods out of all the spacers for the quad IGU. The lower NFRC thermal conductivity of the softwood, as well as the lower surface film coefficients used for the summer design conditions at 30 and 40Â°C, account for the lower Uwindow-NFRC values. The solid wood Uwindow values with double and triple IGUs had the largest discrepancies between both methods. The Uwindow-NFRC values were up to 13% lower than Uwindow-CEN values. Seeing that the frame is composed of softwood with only minute frame cavities (in size and number), the factor that most likely contributes to the lower Uwindow-NFRC value is the NFRC lower thermal conductivity of softwood. As stated previously, the NFRC's lower thermal conductivity value does give lower Uwindow values, therefore this applies to these simulations. The double IGU results show a larger difference between both methods in the temperatures between 15 and 35Â°C. The surface film coefficients at 30Â°C and above are according to the NFRC and CEN exterior temperature summer design values of 2.75 and 8 W/mÂ²K respectively (the interior surface film coefficients are similar; 2.44 and 2.5 respectively). The CEN value has a higher exterior surface film coefficient which results in higher Uwindow-CEN values which also contributes to the higher Uwindow-CEN values found in the double IGU results. The Spacer A simulations with the solid wood frame showed higher Uwindow values and greater differences between both methods due to its slightly lower thermal performance. Spacer B contains materials that have a higher thermal conductance than Spacer A's materials, however, the height of Spacer B is only 7.874 mm and is set deeper within the frame which allows more space for the krypton/air gas mixture as well as being less subject to the effects of the exterior conditions upon the IGU, by being protected from the frame.

Since extreme annual wind velocities were used in the simulations, they produced surface film coefficients and Uwindow results that represent more extreme conditions (see Section 3.14). The trend showed that the frames with the higher performing IGUs had larger differences between both methods; in addition, there were not any significant differences between the inland and coastal Uwindow values (see Figures 76 & 77). Overall, Uwindow-NFRC values were again primarily lower than Uwindow-CEN values in the 8 climate zones due to the lower NFRC surface film coefficient values. The U-PVC and fiberglass frames had the least differences in Uwindow values between both methods due to their smaller widths (from the sightline to the edge of the frame). A smaller frame width leads to less heat transfer through conduction as influenced by the various exterior temperatures and surface film coefficients of the inland and coastal locations. Again, the different approaches to configuring Ucog; NFRC's higher solar irradiance

114

used for the detailed radiation model on the interior side (ISO, 2003); and the different radiation procedures of both methods, all contribute to higher Uwindow-NFRC values. It is interesting to note that for the inland location of Climate Zone 5, Indianapolis, IN, there was a considerable increase in thermal transmittance compared to Vancouver, BC. Indianapolis has a slightly higher annual average temperature and extreme annual wind velocity than Vancouver. These values account for the higher Uwindow values for Indianapolis. The slight variation between inland and coastal locations in all of the other climate zones is attributed to the higher and lower wind velocities and annual average temperature. For example, an inland and coastal location within the same climate zone will have similar Uwindow values (i.e. Toronto, ON and St. John's, NFLD), if the annual average temperature of the inland location is higher (9.2 vs 4.7Â°C) and the wind velocity is lower than the coastal location (9.1 vs 12.3 m/s). Similarly, an inland location with a lower annual average temperature will have a similar Uwindow value if the wind velocity is higher than the coastal location; they balance each other. However, if both the annual average temperature and wind velocity is higher for one location than the other, the Uwindow values were found to be higher as well.

5.7 Harmonization of the CEN and NFRC Uwindow Calculation Methods
Taking into account the percentage changes of all of the frame types and glazing combinations, the overall weighting of the magnitude of the percentage changes for each frame type was determined. Figure 78 and Table B-43 compare the NFRC and CEN methods using the NFRC exterior temperature of -18Â°C and the CEN exterior temperature of 0Â°C. Out of 34 window simulations, the majority of simulations showed only a 0-4% difference in NFRC and CEN values for the same window. Only 5 outliers were between a 5 and 6% difference in NFRC and CEN Uwindow values for the same window (i.e. triple IGUs solid wood frame in both methods and the quad TBSW in the CEN method). This finding may support a possible amalgamation between the two methods whereby using the same exterior temperature boundary conditions yields analogous results that primarily lie in a percentage error margin of 0-4%. A 4% lower Uwindow-NFRC value translates to a 0.05 W/m2K lower value than the CEN value. A 4% higher Uwindow-CEN value translates to a 0.05 W/m2K higher value than the NFRC value. The results that lie in the higher 5-6% percentage error margin also support the possibility of amalgamating both methods for it translates to 0.06 W/m2K higher Uwindow-CEN values in this study. When comparing the percentage errors found in the RDH Building Engineering Ltd. (2014) study, where Uwindow-NFRC values were found to be 14% lower to 18% higher than CEN values, and this study where Uwindow-NFRC values were 1% lower to 11% higher than CEN values, the proposed amalgamation results (see Sections 5.6.2 & 5.6.3), have a 115

minimal percentage error margin of 0-6%. Two of the outliers were found with the triple IGUs with the solid wood frame; this may be attributed to the larger width of the frame that is exposed to the exterior and thus the change in exterior temperature is more pronounced with these frames.

Figure 78 NFRC and CEN U-window Values with NFRC Exterior Temperature Boundary Condition

In addition, this study's findings in comparing NFRC and CEN Uwindow values for the same window unit, have less of a variation than the generalized notion in the building community that NFRC values were approximately 10% higher or lower than CEN values. Generally, considering the triple and quad high performance window combinations with Spacer C, there is a minimal, 0 to 6% difference between the standard NFRC and CEN methods and boundary conditions. For several triple IGU combinations where the Uwindow-NFRC values are 6% lower than CEN values, this difference translates to a minimal increase in U-window value by 0.067 W/m2K. The impact of this increase upon a building's annual energy intensity use would need further research considering the size and quantity and cardinal direction of the aforementioned triple glazed window units; this is presently outside the scope of this study. However, the lower Uwindow-NFRC values are slightly beneficial for North American window manufacturer as it gives a slightly higher thermal performance value in the NFRC and CEN calculation methods and 116

thus in both North American and European markets. On the other hand, other factors need to be deliberated upon along with thermal performance. Depending on one's location, a North American window with a 0.05 W/m2K lower U-value may be chosen for a building located in North America which results in financial and environmental savings for the builder as shopping locally (within North America) does not incur overseas transportation costs and thus reduces carbon emissions and fossil fuel consumption. Likewise, for a building located in Europe, the same North American window may be competitive within that market when this amalgamation method is used. For example, for a standard NFRC rated window with a 0.96 W/m2K U-value and a CEN rating of 0.91 W/m2K, the CEN value would be favoured when selecting for higher thermal performance and achieving specified metrics for primary energy such as that for the Passive House standard. However, the little gain in thermal performance (in a whole building energy simulation) may not justify the transportation costs of importing the European window product into North America. On the other hand, this window may be competitive in the European market for its thermal performance when using the amalgamation method which gives a Uwindow-NFRC of 0.88 W/m2K. Similarly, overseas transportation costs to Europe need to be considered as well. Using the proposed amalgamation method by synchronizing the exterior temperatures according to the standard exterior temperatures, the North American windows used in this study would have a lower Uwindow value using both the NFRC and CEN calculation methods. In terms of thermal performance, simply using the same exterior temperature boundary conditions in computer simulations could potentially support and enable the effort in creating a fairer method in comparing window products. To evaluate the proposed amalgamation method, a comparison of Uwindow values, according to the NFRC and CEN method, was conducted at an exterior temperature range from -40 to 40Â°C. The NFRC and CEN Uwindow values were compared at nine temperature points in this range for all frame types with double, triple and quad IGUs with a high and low SHGC. Overall, the Uwindow-NFRC values were 8% lower to 4% higher than Uwindow-CEN values for all of the exterior temperatures (see Figures 79 & 80). The majority of NFRC values were lower than CEN values. 88% of the values each had between a 0-5% difference between both methods. However, 12% of the values were between a 6 and 8% percentage change. By using the same thermal conductivities and tweaking the variations between the center-of-glazing simulations, the percentage change margin could be altered. Foremost, further research is needed to test the proposed amalgamation method to measure its suitability for windows that varying levels of thermal performance. 117

Frame Cavity Method For the high performance frames in this study, the difference in the frame cavity methods of both methods is negligible. However, caution needs to be taken for lower performing frames where there is a plethora of cavity regions within the frame. Out of all the frames, the U-PVC frame had the most frame cavities without any insulation materials and the results showed a larger difference of 4% in Uframe values between both methods. The number, size and configuration of the frame cavities impact the frame cavity surface temperatures where the larger the frame cavity and the more thermally conductive the frame materials are, the greater the likelihood of heat transfer to occur through 118

conduction, radiation and convection. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis can specify the impact of heat transferred through increased convection flows within frame cavities; this has been identified by Curcija (2005) and other studies. This study also supports the need for further research into the CFD analysis of high performance frames in order to measure and standardize the impact of CFD of convection flows in frame cavities. Therefore, the difference in frame cavity methods has more of an impact in frames with more frame cavities, and materials that are more thermally conductive seeing that they impact the frame cavity surface temperatures. Radiation Model The radiation models of both methods could potentially be synchronized seeing that the NFRC detailed radiation model and the CEN simplified radiation model are the same. The harmonization of several aspects both methods could be achieved where both methods could use the same radiation model and use the same thermal conductivities for all the materials and gases.

Uframe Method
When comparing aspects of a whole window unit, the CEN method's procedure in determining Uframe is considered to be the most accurate in giving the thermal transmittance of the frame by itself, without the influence of the IGU. Since Uframe-NFRC does not give the thermal transmittance of the frame by itself, the CEN Uframe method would be beneficial as an international standard for determining Uframe in order for different frames to be fairly compared in the international market. Keeping in mind that the different boundary conditions and calculation methods produce different results, the NFRC boundary conditions could be used. Further research and collaboration between NFRC and CEN experts would be needed to determine an NFRC method of determining Uframe with a calibration panel. Foremost, simulation results would need to be compared with physical lab testing to determine the accuracy of this. The NFRC method may potentially adopt the proposed amalgamation method of using the same exterior temperature for the calibration panel where the calibration panel is drawn in THERM and simulated according to the NFRC method; however boundary conditions would need to be altered. Other Harmonizing Strategies and Areas that need Improvement A clearer labeling system of glazing products is needed where the SHGC is specified for an individual glazing product (glazing only) and window product (with the frame) separately. Although each method for determining the SHGC of the glazing by itself are similar to each other, using the same boundary 119

conditions and thermal conductivities would aid in synchronizing SHGC values. Similarly, adopting the same thermal conductivities of gas infill mixtures and the same Ucog procedure would be beneficial for comparing individual glazing products. Due to the trends found in this study, where Ucog values largely influenced the differences in U-values of both methods, the harmonization of the Ucog procedure of both methods needs further research. Likewise, harmonized surface film coefficient sets and summer and winter boundary conditions for an international standard needs further research. The NFRC and CEN methods each have inherent strengths, however, elements of both could be viable in the international market. This study supports the findings identified by RDH Building Science Engineering Ltd. (2014), where the CEN method is found to be more accurate in comparing individual window components. The NFRC method is considered to be more accurate in determining thermal transmittance, SHGC and center-of-glass values of the actual window product at specified product dimensions as identified by the NFRC standard (see Table 7). In consideration of the results of this study, the CEN method is considered to be the preferred method of calculating the whole window U-value (i.e. UW-ITN'L). However, a whole window U-value, for each climate zone in North America and Europe, would be ideal for each window product using the annual average exterior temperatures. A unified material and gas thermal conductivity list is necessary for a fairer comparison of products. The NFRC interior surface film coefficients are considered to be more accurate as they are specified according to the type of frame material; the interior reduced radiation sections may be omitted seeing that using one interior surface film coefficient simplifies the simulation process. Physical lab testing is needed to test the applicability and accuracy of this method. Foremost, physical lab testing of an array of current high performance window products would also help identify which method is more accurate in calculating thermal transmittance. In addition, further testing using computer simulations could be performed to narrow the scope of physical lab testing that would be necessary, thereby reducing costs. Using 3D software may highlight the heat transfer characteristics in a more detailed manner, particularly in the IGU; this is beyond the scope of this study, however, physical lab testing would need to be rigorous (see Section 7).

6 Further Research and Conclusions
6.1 Conclusion
This study has shown the critical importance and intricacies of the calculation methods and procedures used in determining the thermal transmittance of window products. A comparative evaluation of the NFRC and CEN U-value calculation methods was conducted for several North American residential high performance window products. An evaluation of the several parameters that are most influential in determining the whole window U-value for high performance windows in North America's eight climate zones was also performed. Given that certified Passive House windows are among the most high performance windows in the North American market, four frame types with double, triple and quad glazing combinations selected from several certified PHIUS windows, were simulated and calculated according to the NFRC and CEN standard methods. The differences that were found between both calculation methods showed that each window product configuration and material property react distinctively to the assumptions and boundary conditions of each method. The results of this study aid in identifying and explaining the percentage change between both methods, as well as, determining how each method defines and utilizes various parameters. The trend showed that the higher the performance of the IGU, the lesser the differences in Uwindow between the NFRC and CEN methods. The variances are accrued to the effect of the different exterior and interior temperature differences, surface film coefficients, frame cavity methods, Uframe methods, Ucog methods, material thermal conductivities and different Uwindow calculations. Lower performing windows would exhibit larger differences between both methods due to the greater influence of the exterior temperature on the gas infill in the lower insulative IGU. This is due to the heat transfer effects of the IGU transferring to the lower performing frame. The significant weighting of the Ucog in the Uwindow calculation results in a lower Uwindow value. Different calculations, assumptions and boundary conditions highlight the uniqueness of the NFRC and CEN standard thermal transmittance methods and therefore each method should be treated as such. Seeing that the average U-values give a better indication as to the thermal transmittance being achieved in each climate zone, the climate specific Uwindow-NFRC values for the high performance windows (i.e. frames with triple and quad IGUs) were found to be approximately 0-14% higher than the standard NFRC value and 7% lower to 2% higher than the CEN standard values. This study has shown that the overall U-value for each window combination can potentially vary significantly across specific North

121

American cities in the eight climate zones. Although the material conductivity does not change with different exterior temperatures, the change in exterior temperature in both calculation methods directly influences the convective and conductive heat transfer effects upon the gas infill in the IGU. The heat transfer effects within the IGU are filtered through the spacer and frame materials and frame cavities. Since the Ucog and Uframe are the main components of the U-value calculations, the interior and exterior temperature difference influences the whole Uwindow value. Furthermore, the thermal transmittance of the IGU is critical in the thermal performance of a building, considering that the primary insulative barrier to changes in exterior temperature in the IGU is the gas infill. Climate specific Uwindow values can aid energy modellers, designers and builders in configuring a clearer impression of the annual energy use intensity of a building. The average annual temperature is considered suitable to obtain climate specific Uwindow values seeing that there are not any significant differences in Uwindow for the average annual high and low temperature ranges. Considering the differences in the U-values of each method were generally smaller for high performance windows, the varying values of boundary conditions had less influence than on lower performing windows, as seen in previous studies. Altogether, this leads to the harmonization of both methods. Some of the parameters that could be harmonized include the exterior and interior temperatures, surface film coefficients, frame cavity methods, SHGC of the IGU without the frame and the Uframe method. Ideally, a single ISO international window calculation procedure for determining thermal transmittance would allow for an equitable and fair comparison of window products in the international market. In working towards this, using the same exterior temperature, as shown in this study, could aid in harmonizing the NFRC and CEN methods, until an international standardized method is conceived. A harmonized international thermal transmittance calculation method would be highly beneficial for the window and high performance building industry in creating a fair market and more accurate performance metrics for energy models.

6.2 Areas of Further Research
1) Physical lab testing of the proposed amalgamation in the goal of attaining a single harmonized international calculation method for determining a window product's thermal transmittance. 2) Physical lab testing of each method and comparing their accuracy to current high performance window products. The following details need to be considered:

a) Accurate U-values are difficult to achieve seeing that it is challenging to reflect the environmental conditions of actual use in physical laboratories (Klems & Reilly, 1990). Physical lab testing does not allow for a stringent test of the frame calculations, however, frame effects are somewhat detectable, yet do not mar with calculation results; experiments are also not sensitive to edge corrections (Klems & Reilly, 1990). b) In comparison with the European EN ISO 8990 and the American ASTM C1363-05 hot box tests, the Russian GOST 26602.1-99 test is more precise in obtaining "the individual measurements of the thermal characteristics of sample components" (Asdrubali & Baldinelli, 2011). This Russian test combined with the European or American test for comparative purposes would be an ideal approach to testing the thermal characteristics of specific components (Asdrubali & Baldinelli, 2011). c) Further research could involve the measurement of the frame junctions with thermocouples since present measurement methods of the NFRC and CSA do not measure those areas; measuring the frame junctions could in effect give a clearer picture as to the amount of heat transfer that is happening in those specific areas. This may change the overall Uframe value. d) Further research utilizing 3D simulations to measure the thermal transmittance of various high performance windows and comparing those results with physical lab tests could determine the accuracy 3D simulations. e) There is also the need for further research into the CFD analysis of high performance frames in order to measure and standardize the impact of CFD of convection flows in frame cavities. f) Comparing the Uwindow values of differently-sized windows and window types.

3) There were some issues that was found through the breadth of the research that was largely absent from the literature. There is thus a need for research to estimate, reconcile and rectify the historical environmental and social impact of the building industry: namely, education and honouring of First Nation Treaties where respectful relationships and negotiations are needed in regards to accessing natural resources. Environmental and social impacts of other local communities also need to be researched and respected.

Computer Simulations vs Physical Lab Tests
Chen and Wittkopf (2012) showed that in their calorimetric hot box measurements and THERM and WINDOWS simulations, both test measurements were in congruence and both methods were capable of accounting for the thermal effects of specific parts of a window component using summer conditions, specifically the positive effects caused by warm edge spacers (Chen & Wittkopf, 2012). Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that there was an agreement between observed and calculated results which supported the suitability of using computer simulations to measure thermal performance (Arasteh, Beck, Stone, duPont, Mathis, & Koenic, 1994). In addition, Klems and Reilly (1989) and Wright and Sullivan (1988) found that numerical calculations could be based on computer simulations and could "accurately predict the thermal performance of edge-seals" (Wright & H.F., Glazing system U-value measurements using a guarded heater plate apparatus, 1988). The Passive House certification in Europe and the U.S., and other European rating councils such as the British Fenestration Rating Council solely require computer simulation to verify and rate the thermal performance of window products. Canada, the U.S. and Australia are also increasingly relying on computer simulations for verifying thermal performance (Curcija C. , 2005). The NFRC presently uses physical lab tests and computer simulations, however, due to the time consuming process and the high cost of physical lab tests, the NFRC is leaning toward a reliance on computer simulations to rate window products (Curcija C. , 2005). Computer simulations not only cost less than physical lab tests; they allow manufacturers to simulate numerous ideas to thousands of products in an iterative design process, thereby expanding design possibilities (Arasteh, Mathis, & DuPont, The NFRC Window U-Value Rating Procedure, 1992) (Arasteh, Finlayson, Huang, Huizenga, Mitchell, & Rubin, 1998). Computer simulations also help to distinguish differences in products that have similar thermal performance that may not be noticeable or clearly identified in physical lab tests (Arasteh, Mathis, & DuPont, The NFRC Window UValue Rating Procedure, 1992) (Arasteh, Finlayson, Huang, Huizenga, Mitchell, & Rubin, 1998). Lab testing procedures have several difficulties in measuring thermal performance, these include: 1. "Repeatability and accuracy: a lab test can produce a reasonably accurate U-value, however, it will not always produce the same number and may fail to properly distinguish between 2 or more products with performance levels that are very close to each other (i.e. High performance products)" (Arasteh, Mathis, & DuPont, The NFRC Window U-Value Rating Procedure, 1992) (Arasteh, Finlayson, Huang, Huizenga, Mitchell, & Rubin, 1998) 124

2. Waste of Resources: since there are similar products by different manufacturers, it is not efficient to replicate tests when the information already exists (Arasteh, Mathis, & DuPont, The NFRC Window U-Value Rating Procedure, 1992)

In light of these limitations for physical lab tests, it is acknowledged that other physical lab testing methods may give accurate results for identifying specific thermal loss regions, such as those that use thermographic cameras. This is included in the further areas of research and is beyond the scope of this research.

11 Appendix E
Problems with Computer Simulations and Error Possibilities 1. In WINDOW, when "-1 Glz system table cannot be found" pop-up window appears when simulating a whole window U-values, simply copy the file and calculate again. Clicking "New File" results in the error pop-up window again. 2. For the NFRC method, you need to calculate and save the results in the THERM file in order for WINDOW to upload the results for the whole window calculations. 3. THERM does not calculate U-values across a 0Â° temperature differential. Using the CEN method in WINDOW at 20, 30 and 40Â°C gives different Ug values every time "calculate" is pressed. WINDOW gives different center-of-glass U-values for each method sometimes, even when no variables are changed. Clicking calculate in the standard NFRC and CEN method then going back to the simulation sometimes corrects this. 4. Working with new boundary conditions in the NFRC and CEN methods need to be redefined in WINDOW before importing in THERM. For example, for each minute change in temperature and other boundary conditions, the WINDOW file needs to be changed accordingly. Simply changing the boundary conditions in THERM after an IGU is imported does not change the U-value of the IGU according to the new boundary conditions for that THERM session. There needs to be a method to change the U-cog in THERM without having to insert the glazing each time a boundary condition is changed. 5. When doing total window calculations in WINDOW, sometimes an error pop-up states that the U-cog cannot be calculated. Here, the glazing IGU has to be recalculated at the specified boundary conditions and then the total window calculations can be performed. 6. Sometimes when files are opened in THERM, the boundary conditions changed and sometimes the U-values changed. The reason is unknown. For this thesis, the THERM files were calculated, saved and imported into WINDOW in the same session; the U-values of the files from THERM were checked with the imported WINDOW files to ensure they were the same. 7. For the CEN method, when drawing boundary conditions, the THERM file draws them according to the CEN Interior boundary conditions used when importing the IGU. There is not an option for specified interior reduced radiation segments for the CEN interior when importing an IGU. Therefore, the reduced radiation segments need to be redrawn then "calculate" can be pressed; otherwise the original interior boundary conditions will be assigned to the entire interior surface. 8. When importing IGUs from WINDOW, import should not be pressed too quickly; make sure that the pop-up window appears that asks for the library to be reloaded, otherwise the previous IGU is inserted. 9. Some minor errors were found in the original THERM files that were changed for the simulations. For example, a U-surface factor tag in one boundary segment can change the U-value results quite significantly, especially if the wrong U-surface factor tag and surface

film coefficient is assigned in the edge-of-glazing area; even a millimeter can make a difference of 0.05 W/m2K. 10. When using different exterior temperatures in the NFRC method, the temperatures used in both the convection and black body radiation model needs to be the same temperature. If they are not the same temperature, this will alter the U-value results significantly.
