Presented at: The Institute for Industrial Engineers (IIE) Annual Conference and Expo, May 30-June 3, 2009, Miami, FL.
Social Simulations Teach Engineering Students to Gain `Buy-In' for Human Factors Neumann, W.P. and Rosen, R. This presentation describes social skill development of undergraduate industrial engineering students using `social simulations' in which students interact with trained actors in a designed social scenario. We present the example scenario of a young engineer who must gain buy in from industrial personnel to apply human factors (HF) in production system design. This experiential learning activity was designed with the Interpersonal Skills Teaching Centre at Ryerson University, in response to research evidence that training engineers in HF science alone is ineffective if the organisational environment and culture do not `buy-in' to available benefits. The simulation is enacted by 3 actor/simulators in 2 scenes. They represent the plant manager, human resources manager, union representative, maintenance manager, purchasing agent, and production supervisor for a small manufacturing plant. Students take turns being engineers from head office who have been sent to help design a new production system for improved performance and reduced injury using HF principles. Students must address the concerns of each of the plant's stakeholders to gain buy-in for this new approach for production development. This presentation will present and discuss the methodology and evaluation options for this technique for teaching social skills to engineering students.

Teaching Objectives · Engineers need stronger social skills
­ Modern, multi-stakeholder design teams

Rheta Rosen
Interpersonal Skills Teaching Centre, www.ryerson.ca/istc Ryerson University, Toronto

· Ergonomics needs to be applied early in design where costs are lowest and benefits greatest

W.P. Neumann - Human Factors Engineering Lab

Interpersonal Simulations · Professional Actors · Designed Scenario (set roles not scripts) · Students interact with characters in the scenario
­ NOT role-playing (students are engineers)

Interpersonal Simulations... · `Experiential Learning' modality
­ Makes links between theory and practice

· Actors and Facilitator provide feedback on interaction quality (social skills)
W.P. Neumann - Human Factors Engineering Lab

· · · · ·

Enhance communication skills Increasingly g y used Provide graduates with career skills Many disciplines across universities Are both educational and FUN

W.P. Neumann - Human Factors Engineering Lab

Experiential Learning · Experiential learning: "involves the whole person in experiencing by simulation..... that which happens in the real world" (Downs 1992). · Simulation can help make continuous linkages between theory and practice (Kates 1994)

Evidence of Effectiveness
· Experiential learning improves grades for Construction Engineering students who are open to it
· ( Lee, McCullough and Chang, 2008).

· Simulations enlivens the classroom and enhanced the learning experience
· (Lantis, (Lantis 1998)

Ergonomics Agenda
· Work related illness and injury
­ 4% World GDP (WHO) ­ Costs ~= all cancer combined

Research Evidence

(Broberg et al. 1997, 2007)

· Poor Ergonomics associated with
­ ­ ­ ­ Injury j y Quality Performance losses Intangible losses (commitment, moral)

· Engineers lack of knowledge limits application of ergonomics · Training engineers in ergonomics alone is not sufficient
­ New N k knowledge l d d does not t get t used d ­ Managers don't require it

· Ergonomics needed in design ­ no retrofitting
W.P. Neumann - Human Factors Engineering Lab

Solution? Trained engineers need to be able to argue effectively for apply ergonomics into design processes
W.P. Neumann - Human Factors Engineering Lab

Teaching Scenario · Developed based on past professional and research experience
­ Roles and relationships in ergo (Neumann et. al, 1999) ­ Auto parts sector (Canada & Sweden) ­ Electronics sector (Canada & Sweden ­ Discussions with ergonomists world-wide

The Scenario: Gaining Buy in for HF · Opportunity: A company with rocky safety and production record is to build a new product · VP (head office) wants HF included in the approach · Students (Engineers from HO) are to meet with plant personnel, engage them in process which is to include HF in design from the start
W.P. Neumann - Human Factors Engineering Lab

· Developed in cooperation with Ryerson's Interpersonal Skills Teaching Centre

2 Scenes 1 Goal: Get buy-in for ergo in design

Simulation · 2 students led meetings
­ Interact with characters naturally ­ `Time-Out' if uncertain how to proceed
· Actors will `go neutral' · Facilitator can discuss with class and/or Swap in a new pair of students

· Scene 1:
­ Starts with plant manager ­ Adds HR and Engineering managers
· Arrive late, not prepared, not aware

· Scene 2:
­ Starts with Line supervisor and Union Rep ­ Adds Purchasing manager
· Arrives late, does not understand why invited

­ Action proceeds with `Time-In'

· Feedback from 'simulators' at the end

Simulator/Actor Roles · Simulators instructed to:
­ Not understand `ergonomics' ­ Respond to reasonable explanations ­ Respond to appeals to their interest
· · · · Managers want smooth productivity low errors HR & Union want no injuries Supervisor wants no absenteeism Maintenance wants no equipment damage

Discussion · How can young engineers who have not been in the workplace relate to these situations? · Argumentation needs preparation
­ Need ready response to standard blockers

­ Provide feeback on interpersonal skills
· Body and verbal communication

Discussion Conclusions · Social Simulation shows good potential for training new engineers to argue effectively for human factors (ergonomics) · Students report a positive experience experience... · Real benefits may only appear much later in professional life · Evaluation of the approach?
