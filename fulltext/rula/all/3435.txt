ABSTRACT Pincer ligands are monoanionic, tridentate binding molecules that have been used in coordination chemistry as efficient homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts (i.e. as transition metal complexes). The focus of this work lies in the synthesis, characterization and coordination chemistry of a series of novel asymmetric potentially monoanionic NN'N", NN'C and NN'P type pincer ligands with amide functionality derived from the skeleton of 2-(2'-anilinyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline. Modular approach to this synthesis has been developed through an alkyl halide intermediate, in addition to the substrate-dependent alternative pincer syntheses, which are also described. The coordination chemistries of Pd and Ni, as well as the potential application of these pincer complexes in metal mediated catalysis of aldehyde allylation reactions will be explored. Moreover, a number of Pd(II) pincer complexes have been successfully synthesized and structurally characterized and these results are likewise described.

CHAPTER 1 ­ INTRODUCTION 1.1 PINCER LIGANDS AND COMPLEXES Even though coordination compounds have existed for a long time, it was not until the late nineteenth century that Alfred Werner proposed the octahedral structures for Co(III) complexes, and as such pioneered this area of study. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on coordination compounds in 1913 and has since been referred to as the "Father of Coordination Chemistry".1,2 In coordination chemistry, ligand can be defined as an ion or molecule bound to a metal atom through a coordinating bond, forming a coordination complex. This bond is due to an electron pair donation from the ligand to the metal. In contrast, a chelating ligand has two or more points of attachment to the metal centre. Ligands can also be described as mono-, bi-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexadentate, having one through six atoms of attachment, respectively (see Figure 1.1).3

Figure 1.1 Classification of ligands (L = ligand, M = metal atom). Over the years chelating ligands have been of much interest and use for catalytic purposes.4,5 An important class of chelate chemistry is comprised of pincer ligands and their complexes. Ever since the original PCP type pincer ligand was reported by Molton and Shaw in 19766 (Scheme 1.1) ­ pincer complexes have become prominent as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in both organic synthesis and materials

1

science.7-12 But it was not until late 1980s that this class of ligands received the name of the `pincer', a term coined by the pioneer in the field ­ Gerard van Koten. Pincers can be defined as tridentate ligands with one formal anionic coordinating atom and two neutral coordinating atoms binding to a central atom in typically a mer configuration.13,14 Over the years, this definition has been broadened (Scheme 1.1), and the scope of pincer chemistry has been extended to encompass various coordinating atoms (e.g., P, N, S, O).1 To control the property of a metal centre, the pincer ligand framework can be modified with respect to both steric and/or electronic features. This has led to the development of a large number of different types of pincer ligands. The coordination modes of pincer ligands in complexes have been found to be L3, L2X, LX2, and X3 (where L = neutral atom and X = anionic atom)15

Scheme 1.1 The evolution of the pincer definition. Depending on the character of the coordinating atoms on the pincer ligand, each individual M-ligand interaction can either be reinforced or competed against. For example, having -donating or -accepting phosphanyl groups on a PCP pincer can either reinforce or compete against a -donating central aryl moiety ­ this provides a 2

certain level of control over the dipolar nature of the pincer complex.16 The unique qualities of pincer ligands include: their typical high thermal stability, as well as imparting a greater reactivity to transition metal complexes versus those without pincertype ligands.16-18 From the onset of the pincer chemistry, the research focus lied on the ECE type pincer ligands with the central position having an anionic Cipso, (part of the phenyl ring), with two identical ortho substituents (A, Figure 1.2).19 Lately the research into pincer chemistry led to investigations of non-carbon monoanionic framework20 with two ortho moieties having different substituents, as well as having different E donor atoms all together, giving it C1 point group symmetry (B or C, Figure 1.2). The manipulation of a pincer ligand with respect to its structure is an endless endeavour.

Metal complexes formed with oxazoline moieties, combined with phosphorus, nitrogen or oxygen as donor atoms, often showcase interesting electronic properties associated with catalysis.22 For example, it has also been shown that Pd complexes containing oxazoline moiety (D, see Figure 1.4) have demonstrated oxidatively robust systems with respect to applications in cross coupling reactions.23

Coordination of pincer ligand E (Figure 1.4) and its derivatives has been studied with Pt and Pd metals, showcasing successful application in catalysis of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions.24-30 1.1.2 Asymmetric pincer complexes in catalysis Since asymmetric pincer ligand complexes have gained the spotlight in the scientific community, their catalytic activity has been of great interest. Some of the reactions that they were found to catalyze include: ethylene polymerization, hydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, dehydrogenation or oxidation (of alcohols), cyclopropanation, and such 4

cross-coupling reactions such as the Kumada (coupling of an organic halide and Grignard reagent), Suzuki (coupling of an organic halide and boronic acid), Heck (coupling of an organic halide and an alkene) and Stille (coupling of an organo halide and organotin) coupling reactions.31-36 Transition metal pincer complexes have also shown great potential in stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity,19,37 however, chiral complexes have been investigated less because the auxiliary ligands have been responsible for the enantioselectivity in catalysis.7 Pincer complexes also exhibit high thermal stability and interesting properties of robustness, which make them even more desirable for homogeneous catalysis.37 The environmental aspect of any chemical transformation is greatly affected by the amounts and types of reagents used. That is why the use of catalyst is preferred over the use of stoichiometric amounts of reagents.38 One of the most important reactions involved in producing chiral alcohols is the asymmetric reduction of ketones. So far, Ru, Rh, Ir and Os complexes have been synthesized and successfully applied in ketone hydrogenation and transfer

hydrogenation reactions. For Ru catalyzed process, the presence of an -NH2 group is crucial for the catalysis and formation of Ru-H hydride, this relationship can be described as a metal-ligand bifunctional catalysis.32 Based on this find, Baratta et al. have developed new Ru (and Os) complexes with chiral asymmetric NNC pincer ligands that carry an -NH2 functionality. The presence of the  metal-carbon bond in these complexes has been shown to prevent catalyst deactivation and at the same time ensures high stability and productivity. During catalysis the Ru pincer complex is formed in situ, and hence had to be isolated separately to study in detail.39

Figure 1.5 Asymmetric Ru and Os pincer complexes. Preliminary catalytic study of Ru and Os complexes identified complex F and G as the most suitable candidates for further catalytic investigation. Transfer hydrogenation of ketones catalyzed by F and G showed promising results (Scheme 1.2), where ketones have been reduced to their secondary alcohol forms with 80-99% conversion, 92-99% ee and TOF ranging from 1.9 to 26 × 104 h-1 for F and 93-99% conversion, 90-99% enantioselectivity and TOF ranging from 5.1 to 90 × 104 h-1 for G. However, attempts at the reduction of sterically demanding ketones revealed low alcohol conversions of only up to 20%. Overall, both Ru and Os NNC complexes used in transfer hydrogenation of ketones proved to be effective catalysts, with G having the greatest percentage conversion(s) and TOF.39

In 2012, Du et al. reported a Ru catalyst with an unsymmetrical NNC pincer ligand (complex H, Figure 1.6) that successfully catalyzes the transfer hydrogenation and Oppenauer-type dehydrogenative oxidation of alcohols, vide infra (Scheme 1.3).40

The complex was also characterized using X-Ray crystallography and was shown to have a neutral molecular structure with the NNC ligand in nearly a planar tridentate orientation.40 The transfer hydrogenation of ketones was carried out in 2-propanol under a nitrogen atmosphere in the presence of 0.1 mol% of the catalyst, H (see Scheme 1.3). A variety of substituted ketones were transformed, including substituted acetophenones, aliphatic cyclic and acyclic ketones. Overall, the conversion of the ketones was observed to be greater than 98% within 1 min with TOF values of up to 18 × 104 h-1. The ketones with electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryl rings had a higher rate of reaction, whereas ortho substituted ketones had a reduced reaction rate due to the steric considerations. It should be noted that no transfer hydrogenation is observed in the absence of a base.40 The Oppenauer-type oxidation is a widely used method for production of carbonyl compounds without using stoichiometric amounts of oxidants. Similar to the transfer hydrogenation reactions above, the secondary alcohols undergo dehydrogenative oxidation with H (0.5 mol%) with tBuOK (10 mol%) in refluxing acetone (Scheme 1.3). 7

Scheme 1.3 Catalytic transformations using Ru NNC pincer complex, H. The oxidation of alcohols was successfully carried out from 1 min to 3 h, averaging at conversions greater than 97% and with TOF values of up to 1.2 × 104 h-1. This catalytic activity represents one of the best reported to date.40 The coordination of the Ru, Rh, Pd and Au with NNC pincer ligands was reported to work through Lin's method of transmetallation.38 Reacting the NNC pincer ligands with Ag2O in DCM ­ produced a silver(I) intermediate complex. With the addition of each appropriate metal precursor to the reaction solution directly, allowed for the complexes I ­ L to be formed in excellent yields (>90 %). Upon coordination of the ligands, a new chiral centre is introduced in all of the complexes (Figure 1.7), and the coordination of Ru is completely stereospecific.38 Catalytic behaviour of I was tested on a hydrogenation reaction of diethyl citraconate and diethyl 2-benzylidenesuccinate. All the catalysts show high enantioselectivity and activity for the hydrogenation of diethyl 2-benzylidenesuccinate, the enantioselectivity is low with respect to the desired enantiomer, even though activity is high for the diethyl citraconate substrate.38

Figure 1.7 Asymmetric NNC pincer complexes with Ru, Rh, Pd and Au. Prior to the synthesis of NNC Ru complexes (I), Boronat et al. looked at the chemistry of the NNC pincer type ligand of Rh (J), Pd (K) and Au (L).41 Catalytic activity of Rh complexes (J[i-ii]) was tested on hydrogenation of olefins, exhibiting high TOF but very low enantioselectivity for diethyl itaconate hydrogenation. Whereas, hydrogenation of diethyl 2-benzylidene succinate was successfully catalyzed by J[i] with good enantioselectivity of 82% for the S stereoisomer and J[ii] with excellent

enantioselectivity (99%) for the R isomer. However, the reaction rates are much lower.41 Catalytic activity of K[i] and K[ii] was also tested on the hydrogenation of olefins as well. Just like with Rh and Au, the reaction rate is higher for the hydrogenation of both diethyl itaconate and diethyl 2-benzylidene succinate catalyzed by K[i], however the enantioselectivity with respect to the S isomer is again very low. On the other hand, K[ii] shows superior enantioselectivity for the R form with moderate reaction rate(s) for the hydrogenation of diethyl 2-benzylidene succinate.41

When the catalytic activity of L[i] and L[ii] was tested on hydrogenation of olefins, both Au complexes (L[i-ii]) showed great enantioselectivity in hydrogenation of diethyl 2benzylidene succinate with moderate reaction rates. However, the reaction rate(s) observed for diethyl itaconate hydrogenation was much higher for both of the Au catalysts, but the enantioselectivity was very low.41 Previous attempts at the synthesis of anionic isoindoline based NNC Pd complex resulted in a neutral NNC pincer. Broring et al. reported Pd complex coordinated to an anionic NNC pincer ligand (M, Figure 1.8) and its first application in catalysis.42

The X-ray structure suggests an almost perfect square planar geometry around Pd and an unanticipated helical twist of the 2-tolti ligand.42 The catalytic activity of complex M was tested on Heck and Stille cross-coupling reactions; for comparison purposes Pd(OAc)2 was used as a standard (Table 1.1). When M was used in Heck cross-coupling reaction ­ the reactivity of the reaction decreases with X = I > X = Br > X = Cl as expected (with yields of 96%, 33% and 1%, respectively). With an increase in steric hindrance (i.e. changing the substrates from R1 10

= R2 = H to R1 = R2 = Me) the yield of the reaction decreased from 96% to 78%, respectively. The same pattern was observed in the catalysis of Stille cross-coupling reaction. Moreover, steric hindrance effect was well-defined, the change in substrate (R1 = R2 = H to R1 = R2 = Me) yielded products from 40% to 20%.42 Table 1.1 Heck and Stille cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by M Substrate Yield (%) TON

Dehydrogenation reactions are coupling reactions that can produce amides, imines, esters and ketones with elimination of H2. These reactions have been studied extensively, and have been shown to be successfully catalyzed by Ru complexes with NNP or PNP pincer ligands as part of their structure; in some cases in the presence of catalytic amounts of base.43,44 Li and Zeng were able to propose the mechanism for the 11

dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with amines catalyzed by NNP-Ru(II) hydride complex (N, Figure 1.9) through density functional theory (i.e. DFT) calculations.43

Figure 1.9 Ru(II) complex with NNP pincer ligand. Other mechanistic studies showed that addition of base is unnecessary in hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions if an NNP Ru hydrido complex is used. An example of such complex, N, is an excellent catalyst for a vast amount of hydrogenation reactions, the coupling of alcohols and amines and the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas.44

Figure 1.10 Synthesis of PNN Ru complex, O. The NNP Ru pincer complex, O (Figure 1.10) was used in catalytic transfer hydrogenation reactions (Table 1.2) exhibiting product yields of up to 99%. It was later tested on the esterification of primary alcohols (Table 1.3) giving the desired product in as high as 99% yield. As with transfer hydrogenation reactions, esterification of alcohols is catalyzed in the absence of a base.45

The examples detailed above give a strong background portfolio that clearly shows that metal-pincer complexes have great potential as asymmetric catalysts and stoichiometric promoters. 1.2 PREVIOUS WORK Gossage et al. previously reported the synthesis of the formally C1-symmetric amide pincer ligand (P, Figure 1.11) through the in situ chlorination of picolinic acid and its reaction with 4,4-dimethyl-2-(o-anilinyl)-2-oxazoline.46

The study of the coordination chemistry of these ligands with Pd and Ni metals as well as the application of the synthesized pincer complexes in catalysis will be explored. These monoanionic pincer

CHAPTER 2 ­ LIGANDS 2.1 Amino acid route Conversion of compound 1 into the respective pincer ligand was initially proposed to take place through an amide coupling with an appropriate amino acid. The formation of the amide bond could be attained either through the use of peptide coupling agents (i.e. DCC or DMTMM) or through the formation of an acyl chloride (Scheme 2.1).50,51

Scheme 2.1 Synthesis of NNN type pincer ligand using 1 and amino acids. A more accessible route to pincer ligand synthesis was needed due to the prominent Zwitterionic effect of amino acids in aqueous solvents, their reactivity in non-polar organic solvents decreases substantially (equation 1) (i.e. Zwitterion ­ an overall neutrally charged molecule having both positive and negative charges).52,53 Me2NCH2COOH  Me2NH+CH2COO(1)

The magnitude of the tautomeric equilibrium for N,N-dimethylglycine is completely solvent dependent, and in most protic and aprotic polar solvents it exists in the Zwitterion form.52

Scheme 2.2 Synthesis of NNN type pincer ligand from N,N-dimethylglycine. 16

We previously showed that carboxylic group on the N,N-dimethylglycine can be transformed into the acyl chloride form using excess thionyl chloride under the neat conditions (Scheme 2.2).54 After the reaction of an amino acid and the thionyl chloride at 50 °C, the excess thionyl chloride was removed and the resulted yellow solid compound, in situ generated N,N-dimethylglycinoyl chloride, was consequently reacted with compound 1 (primary amine) in the presence of Et3N in DCM, which produced the desired pincer ligand, 3a (Scheme 2.2). The structure of this product was analyzed by IR, 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis to successfully support the

formula.54 From the IR spectrum, the presence of a secondary amide (N-H) and an amide carbonyl (C=O) stretch/bend were observed and support the presence of the amide bond (Table 2.1).

C NMR spectrum, agreeing with

the formulation. From the 1H NMR data, two singlet shifts were observed for the methylene groups (H = 4.05 and 3.16 ppm) and two for the equivalent methyl groups (2.39 and 1.41 ppm) integrating for 2 and 6 protons each, respectively. Four protons were also observed in the aromatic region (in the range from 7.07 to 8.84 ppm) with a distinct proton shift at 12.80 ppm for the proton on the amide (-NH) (see Table 2.3). The synthesis of highly functionalized pincer ligands using this route might be problematic, since the amino acid derivative would have to be exposed to harsh conditions when

17

reacted with thionyl chloride, because thionyl chloride is extremely reactive and corrosive. Hence, a new synthetic strategy was devised. 2.2 MODULAR APPROACH The need for the synthesis of easily accessible asymmetric pincer ligands led to the proposed use of 2-chloroacetyl chloride, as a building block to synthesize compound 2 ­ a pincer precursor. 2-Chloroacetyl chloride is often used in organic chemistry to introduce amide bonds (by reacting through the acyl chloride) into a structure, thus providing a functionalizable end group (i.e. a chloromethyl group).55

Scheme 2.3 Synthesis of compound 2 ­ pincer precursor. Upon the addition of 2-chloroacetyl chloride to 1 in the presence of Et3N, the reaction mixture was stirred in DCM at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. The desired product, 2 (Scheme 2.3), was obtained, upon gravity filtration and solvent evaporation, in 85% as an orange coloured crystalline solid. It was analyzed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 2.1, left), elemental analysis and 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy. Both 1H and

13

C NMR

supported the proposed structure of 2. Two singlet shifts were observed for the methylene groups (4.21 and 4.07 ppm) and one for the two equivalent methyl groups (1.41 ppm) integrating for 2 each and 6 protons, respectively. Four protons were also observed in the aromatic region (in the range from 7.13 to 8.74 ppm) with a distinct

18

proton shift at 13.05 ppm for the amide proton (-NH). Twelve unique carbon environments were observed in the 13C NMR and supported the structure of 2. From the crystallographic study of 2 (Figure 2.1, left), hydrogen bonding was reported for the amide hydrogen between both N and Cl atoms on the oxazoline ring (2.03 Å) and on the chloromethyl group (2.468 Å), respectively (Table 2.2). Since crystal structures represent the molecule in the solid state, a DFT calculation was performed on 2 (Figure 2.1, right) to determine the theoretical behaviour of the compound in the gas phase, and to serve as a training exercise to familiarize oneself with the theoretical calculations using molecular modeling software.

The calculated angles and bond lengths for the three atoms involved in the abovementioned hydrogen bonding hydrogen agreed with the crystal structure values (see Table 2.2). The calculation was done at B3LYP with 6-311++G** basis set, with the

19

geometry of the structure being in agreement with the crystal structure (Table 2.2); it should be mentioned that the structure of 2 was optimized several times starting from different geometrical orientations and hence Figure 2.1 (right) represents one of the likely gas phase configurations. 2.2.1 Synthesis of Pincers 3b-3j As previously stated, compound 2 was theorized to be a useful precursor for a modular synthetic approach, wherein this alkyl halide (2) can be reacted with selected secondary amines in the presence of the base to produce the desired pincer products.55 The reaction between a secondary amine and an alkyl halide can be classified as a nucleophilic substitution reaction (i.e. SN2 reaction).50 Therefore, the compounds 3b-3j were synthesized by reacting 2 with the appropriate secondary amine in the presence of K2CO3 as the base, according to Scheme 2.4. Pincer ligands 3b-3j were thus synthesized in moderate to good yields, ranging from 30% to 74% (see Table 2.3). After the purification (see Section 5.2), the compounds were successfully analyzed by 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy, as well as elemental

analysis to support the proposed structures. Compounds 3b, 3g and 3h were also analyzed by IR spectroscopy, confirming the presence of the amide bond through the presence of the typical C=O stretch and N-H bend absorption frequencies (see Table 2.1). The conversion of 2 into the appropriate pincer ligand product can be easily observed by a distinct proton NMR chemical shift of the amide (13.05 ppm for 2; see Table 2.3) functionality which shifts upfield for compounds 3a-3j (Table 2.3). The shift observed can be explained in terms of the increase in the strength of the hydrogen bonding (or an electronically donating interaction) between the H (on the amide) and N 20

(of the tertiary amine) in 3a-3j due to the lone pair of electrons on the latter N atom; in comparison to the hydrogen bonding between the H (on the amide) and Cl (on the chloromethyl) as found in the crystal structure of 2 (Figure 2.1). Hence, shielding of the ­NH proton is observed in 3a-3j. Chiral derivatives, 6 and 7, were also synthesized and are discussed in Section 2.3.

Functionalization of 3b-3j pincer ligands was achieved by using secondary amines: diethylamine (3b), 2-(2-methylaminoethyl)pyridine (3c), N-methyl-N-adamantylamine (3d), pyrrolidine (3e), 2,2'-dipicolylamine (3f), 1-aza-15-crown-5 (3g), N-allyl-N-

methylamine (3h), N-isopropyl-N-methylamine (3i), diallylamine (3j). Compounds 3c and 3f were designed with an extended pincer motif ­ with the potential for the picolyl functional groups to chelate to a metal centre(s); increasing the coordination number to at least four for 3c and potentially five for 3f. An extended pincer ligand, 3f, can also be efficiently applied in homo- or heterobimetallic coordinating systems. Copper can be

22

one of the potential candidates for a bimetallic study on 3f; Brown et al. recently showed a successful coordination and application of Cu with an N,N-bis(2-picolyl)benzamide ligand in methanolysis reactions, for example.56 2.2.2 Synthesis of 3k Pincer 3k was also synthesized since it contains an extended motif and therefore, having the potential to coordinate to the metal centre through four atoms (three N atoms and an O of the hydroxyl group). The synthesis of 3k followed the same procedure as for the 3b-3j, however prior to that the hydroxyl group on N-methylaminoethanol had to be protected due to its reactivity. Several protection reactions were performed on Nmethylaminoethanol to protect the hydroxyl group (Table 2.4). Table 2.4 Protection of the hydroxyl group on the N-methylaminoethanol.

Unsuccessful trials using acetic anhydride (Ac2O) with catalytic amounts of N,Ndimethylaminopyridine (DMAP),57 or hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) with D,L-aspartic acid as a catalyst58 to protect hydroxyl group on the N-methylaminoethanol resulted in unsuccessful outcomes (Table 2.4). The use of trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) in combination with Et3N in Et2O also did not produce successful results in protecting the hydroxyl group.59 However, it has been recently shown that in the presence of 2 eq. of TMSCl in Et2O and in the absence of the base (Et3N), the N-methyl-2((trimethylsilyl)oxy)ethan-1-eminium chloride (4) was isolated in 81% yield. This material can be successfully used to synthesize an appropriate pincer, 3k (Scheme 2.5).60 23

Scheme 2.5 Synthesis of an extended pincer NNNO, 3k, from N-methylaminoethanol. Compound 4 was isolated and successfully characterized by elemental analysis and 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy. From the 1H NMR spectrum, a resonance integrating for 9

protons appears as a singlet at 0.14 ppm, which suggested the presence of the -SiMe3 group on the O atom. The two chemical shifts at 3.08 and 3.93 ppm appeared as triplets and integrated for 2 protons each. The identity of the product, as a chloride salt, was confirmed by the presence of the broad shift at 9.43 ppm integrating for 2 protons; a chemical shift which is indicative of the ­NH2 group.61 With the in situ formation of 4, compound 3k was synthesized in only 12% after purification by the column chromatography. However, after the isolation of 4 and an optimization study was later performed by Jennifer Huynh60 and, of the reaction shown in Scheme 2.5, yields of up to 88% are achievable (Table 2.3). Compound 3k was successfully characterized by elemental analysis and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. As in pincers 3a-3j an indicative ­NH chemical shift was observed at 12.22 ppm for 3k -- an upfield shift compared to the starting material (13.05 ppm; see Table 2.3). The close proximity of the alcohol group on the N atom to the amide proton could create the shielding effect, explaining the observed phenomena.

24

2.2.3 Synthesis of 3l: a carbene-pincer precursor 1-Benzylimidazole62 was synthesized by reacting imidazole hydrochloride with benzyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 in MeCN. Pure compound was isolated in 42% yield as an off-white coloured waxy solid. 1H NMR analysis of 1-benzylimidazole agreed with the literature.62 The synthesis of NNC type pincer ligand, 3l, from 1-benzylimidazole and 2 in THF:MeCN (15.0:3.0 mL ratio) resulted in successful isolation of the desired product in 57% yield as a yellow wax (Scheme 2.6). The low solubility of 1benzylimidazole in THF was resolved by the addition of a small amount of MeCN. The compound, 3l, was successfully analyzed by elemental analysis, 1H and
13

C NMR

spectroscopy. The resonance observed at 12.96 ppm is representative of the ­NH on the amide (Table 2.3). The proton appeared to be more deshielded in comparison to NNN pincers (3a-3k), which can be due to the absence of the hydrogen bonding or other interactions between the hydrogen on the amide and the imidazole moiety. Alternatively, 2l was synthesized from 2 as described in Scheme 2.6, as the precursor for 3l. However, the yield for the reaction to synthesize 2l (56%) did not introduce any benefits into increasing the overall yield for 3l; hence it was not investigated further.

25

2.2.4 Synthesis of 3m and 3m! oxide
The synthesis of NNP type pincer ligand, 3m!oxide, was accomplished by reacting 2 with equimolar THF solution of potassium diphenylphosphide (KPPh2) under nitrogen atmosphere for 24 h (Scheme 2.7).

Scheme 2.7 Synthesis of NNP pincer ligand, 3m, from potassium diphenylphosphide. The work-up of this reaction involved gravity filtration of the KCl, formed as the by-product. By exposing the sample to air and moisture, 3m is readily converted to 3m! oxide and was isolated in 55% yield (Table 2.3). This transition was monitored by
31

P NMR, where 3m and

3m!oxide displaying chemical shifts at -15.77 ppm and 28.48 ppm, respectively. During the first experimental trial of this reaction, diphenylphosphine oxide (O=PPh2H; Ph = phenyl) and diphenylphosphine (HPPh2) were both observed in the reaction mixture p = 21.54 ppm and -40.39 ppm, respectively (Table 2.5). The literature values were in agreement within experimental error, with these observations.63-64

2.2.5 Synthesis of 3n An NNN pincer derivative from 1 and Boc-L-aspartic acid 4-benzyl ester was synthesized using 1.5 eq. DCC (a peptide coupling agent) in DCM (Scheme 2.8). Upon aqueous work-up the compound was obtained in >99% yield as pale yellow wax. Elemental analysis and 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy supported the compounds'

identity. The interest into the development of this particular pincer is its unique applicability. Deprotecting the Boc and the benzyl groups on 3n, deprotects the amine and carboxylic acid functional groups, which can then be covalently bonded to peptides. Combining this pincer ligand with peptides could yield interesting sensor-type molecules. 27

! Scheme 2.8 Synthesis of 3n from 1. 2.3 CHIRAL DERIVATIVES A chiral derivative of 2 was synthesized and isolated in 86% yield following the same procedure: from 2-chloroacetyl chloride and 5 (synthesized as per 149) in DCM (see Scheme 2.9). Peachy-coloured crystalline compound was analyzed by elemental analysis, x-ray crystallography and 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy. Based on the

orientation of the molecule (Figure 2.3), just as in the solid state of compound 2, it appeared that hydrogen bonding was observed for the amide hydrogen between both, the N on the oxazoline and the Cl on the chloromethyl group. From the crystal structure it was also determined that 6 exists as a single R, S stereoisomer.

Scheme 2.9 Synthesis of the chiral derivatives, 6 and NNN type pincer ligand, 7. The reaction of 6 with diethylamine in the presence of K2CO3 in MeCN yielded crude 7 in 55% yield, which was analyzed by 1H NMR. Even after recrystallization, small 28

amounts of starting material (6) were still observed; this suggests a slow decomposition of the product. A singlet observed at 12.54 ppm was indicative of the proton on the amide (Table 2.3) and the ­CH2 and ­CH3 of the ethyl group on the amine were observed in the spectrum at 1.14 ppm and 2.75 ppm as triplet and quartet respectively, having matching J values of 7.2 Hz. These observations concluded that the product present in majority was indeed the desired chiral NNN pincer ligand. Any attempt at functionalizing 6 with 1-benzylimidazole (as for 3l) or KPPh2 (as for 3m) to yield chiral NNC or NNP type pincer ended with unsuccessful results.

CHAPTER 3 ­ COMPLEXES 3.1 PALLADIUM COMPLEXES 3.1.1 NNN type pincer complexes Complexation of NNN type pincer with Pd metal was accomplished using previously reported method of coordination as described by Decken et al. This uses a methanolic solution of Li2PdCl4, as Pd source, at RT (Scheme 3.1).41

Scheme 3.1 Synthesis of Pd-NNN pincer complexes, 9a-e and 9g-k. 30

A solution of Li2PdCl4 was prepared from stoichiometric amounts of LiCl and PdCl2 refluxed in MeOH;41 upon the dissolution of the starting materials the reaction was complete and the Pd precursor solution is ready to use. When Li2PdCl4 was added to a yellow coloured solution of an NNN pincer ligand (i.e. 9a-e or 9g-k) in MeOH, the reaction solution turned bright orange in colour almost instantaneously. All resulting PdNNN complexes, aside from 9c, were purified by redissolving the compound in DCM and filtering the mixture (an orange solution with fine pale coloured precipitates) through a thick layer of Celite. In contrast, 9c was purified using preparative TLC (100% acetone as eluent). All compounds were isolated as either waxy solids or powders, bright yellow to orange in colour, and isolated in yields ranging from 42% to 98%.

Figure 3.1 Crystal structures of 9a (left) and 9h (right) solved by Laura R. Fernández. Suitable crystals for the complexes 9a and 9h were grown to be analyzed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 3.1, left and right respectively). Both of the complexes showed a distorted square planar orientation of the ligated atoms around the metal centre. The Pd atom has a coordination number of 4 in both cases and an assigned oxidation state of +2. The NNN pincer ligands indeed proved to behave as monoanionic ligands, being 31

deprotonated at the amide position during the reaction, as shown previously for Pd complex with ligand P.41 Aside from the X-ray crystallography analysis, all Pd-NNN complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and via
1

H and

13

C NMR

spectroscopy. Proton chemical shifts for methyl and methylene functional groups moved downfield due to the electron withdrawing effect of the metal centre, upon complexation.66 The chemical shifts of the aromatic protons were not considerably affected by complexation. From
13

C NMR, all of the structures for Pd complexes, 9a-e

and 9g-k, support a stoichiometry of Pd:NNN:Cl = 1:1:1. Note that one H has been lost from the free NNN ligand in all cases (Scheme 3.1). 3.1.2 NNC type pincer complex Over the last decade N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have shown promising results in catalysis and specifically in cross-coupling reactions. Hence, NHC-containing ligands have been studied extensively for the design and use of carbene containing catalysts.6769

The NHC ligand is considered a strong -donor and weak -acceptor, which in turn

improves the catalytic activity due to the increase in electron density on the metal centre.70

Scheme 3.2 Synthesis of Pd-NNC pincer complex, 9l.

32

A Pd-NNC complex was synthesized through Lin's method of transmetallation using silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) as the transmetallating agent.69 Ligand 3l was stirred with Ag2O in DCM for 2 h and then the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite. Bis(acetonitrile)palladium(II) dichloride (PdCl2(MeCN)2) was added to the pale yellow filtrate, and the reaction solution turned bright yellow/orange within a few minutes, suggesting complexation (Scheme 3.2). Even though not isolated in this case due to its low stability, the syntheses of silver(I), gold(I) and copper(I) carbene intermediates have been previously reported.71-72 The protocols used here directly parallel those studies.6972

Figure 3.2 The comparison of the 1H NMR spectra for 3l and 9l. The investigation into the coordination of complex 9l using 1H NMR spectroscopy suggets that coordination of Pd to the carbene precursor did take place. This evidence 33

includes the observed chemical shifts for the amide proton (­NHC=O) at 12.96 ppm and the imidazole proton (­NR2CHNR'2­) at 10.71 ppm that are present for the carbene precursor (circled, Figure 3.2). Both of these resonances are absent for the isolated complex. The second order effect was also observed for all three methylene groups, which appeared as singlets at 4.08 ppm, 5.50 ppm and 5.54 ppm on the ligand molecule, 3l. This suggests that those protons reside in different environments and are magnetically inequivalent (Figure 3.2). 3.1.3 NNP type pincer complex Asymmetric pincer ligands containing soft donor atom, such as phosphorus, have also been of much interest with respect to catalysis applications for a wide variety of chemical transformations.73 A Pd-NNP pincer complex was therefore prepared in two steps. Due to the facile oxidation of 3m to 3m! oxide, NNP pincer ligand 3m was synthesized and used in situ following the procedure outlined in Section 2.2.1. The THF solution with 3m was cannula transferred to a MeCN solution of PdCl2(MeCN)2 and the resulting mixture stirred for 24 h (Scheme 3.3) at RT. After this time, the solution was gravity filtered and the solvent was then removed in vacuo. The crude sample of 9m was retrieved in 96% yield, and appeared dark orange in colour.

Scheme 3.3 Synthesis of Pd-NNP pincer complex, 9m 34

However, preparative TLC was used to further purify the compound for complete characterization (elemental analysis and 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy). From the
31

P NMR spectrum, single resonance was observed with a chemical shift of

50.45 ppm, in contrast to the free ligand that was observed at -15.77 ppm, suggesting only one phosphorus environment present.

Figure 3.3 Select 1H chemical shifts for 3m! oxide and 9m, depicting splitting effect. From the 1H NMR spectrum, a second order effect for the methylene groups (-CH2-) can be observed for 9m, where in comparison to 3m! oxide they were observed as singlet and a doublet (coupled to 31P{1H}, J = 15.6 Hz) (see Figure 3.3).

3.2 ATTEMPTS AT THE SYNTHESIS OF NICKEL COMPLEXES 3.2.1 NNN type pincer complexes Both academic and industrial research has witnessed an immense progress in the use of nickel complexes as catalysts in polymerization and cross-coupling type reactions.7475

For this reason, the investigation into employing NNN, NNC and NNP type pincer

ligands, presented in this work, was performed in coordination chemistry with Ni. Gao and co-workers reported Ni-NNN pincer-like complexation using NiCl2!6H2O in ethanol (with or without the base) or NiCl2(DME) and lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) as the base in THF.74 However, following these reaction conditions with 3e pincer ligand did not yield any desired product. In fact, upon reaction work-up, which consisted of gravity filtration and Et2O wash, the resulted yellow waxy compound was found to be the free ligand (entries 1-4, Table 3.1). Peters and coworkers reported coordination of their monoanionic NNN type pincers with Ni through NiCl2(DME) precursor in the presence of Et3N in THF.75 Entry 5 (Table 3.1) depicts the unsuccessful trial with 3e pincer ligand.

The theorized molecular geometry of the diamagnetic Ni-NNN pincer complex was square planar, the colour of which had to be red. However, the reaction solutions for all of the trials (Table 3.1) did not change the colour in the course of the reaction and remained green. 3.2.2 NNC type pincer complex The synthetic route for Ni-NNC pincer complex was employed from the synthesis of 9l, through Lin's method of transmetallation using silver(I) oxide (Ag2O) as the transmetallating agent.69 Ligand 3l was stirred with Ag2O in DCM for 2 h and then the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite. Bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II) dichloride (NiCl2(PPh3)2) was added to the pale yellow filtrate, and the reaction solution turned dark green instantaneously (Scheme 3.4).

Scheme 3.4 Synthesis of Ni-NNC type pincer complex from 3l ligand. 3.2.3 NNP type pincer complex A trial reaction, investigating the synthesis of Ni-NNP complex from 3m and NiCl2DME precursor in the presence of n-BuLi (to deprotonate the amide hydrogen), was followed from the reaction conditions reported by Liu and co-workers (Scheme 3.4).76 First, 3m was treated with n-BuLi and then this solution was added to the suspension of

37

NiCl2DME in THF. The colour of the reaction solution was pale green, and after solvent evaporation, blue waxy compound resulted in having minimal solubility in CDCl3 or benzene-d6. Unfortunately, as previously shown with NNN and NNC type ligands, the complexation and characterization with NNP ligand was also unsuccessful. In contrast to Pd ­ Ni chemistry appeared to be more air/water sensitive and if the paramagnetic complexes are formed ­ the characterization by x-ray crystallography is required.

CHAPTER 4 ­ CATALYSIS 4.1 ALLYLATION OF ALDEHYDES Allylic substitution reactions catalyzed by palladium complexes have become an important set of transformations in modern organic chemistry.77-81 The first series of reports on allylation of aldehydes and imines catalyzed by bis(allyl)palladium species was published by Yamamoto and coworkers in 1996, where the allyltributyltin was the source of the allyl group.82 However, there are two inherent drawbacks with using bis(allyl) complexes. First, the difficulty in controlling the regioselectivity when the two allylic group have different substituents (Scheme 4.1). And secondly, allyl-allyl coupling can occur before the reaction with a desired electrophile.

Scheme 4.1 Bis(allyl)palladium in catalysis.78 Szabó and co-workers theorized using palladium pincer complexes for the allylation of electrophiles, and the monodentate anionic ligand would undergo transmetallation. The pincer ligand to metal bond (that is trans to the Pd-allyl bond) would enhance the nucleophilicity of the allyl fragment.83 So far, the application of the carbon electrophiles in these types of reactions remains unexplored.84

39

Palladium pincer complexes have been considered to be attractive complexes in catalytic applications. Some of the features supporting that argument include: 1) their stability, even during a catalytic transformation the pincer ligand remains tightly bound to the metal centre for the entire duration of the reaction; 2) due to the strong coordination of the pincer, there is only one coordination site, trans to the anionic atom, providing restriction with respect to catalytic sites on palladium; 3) Oxidation state of palladium in pincer complexes is +2 under ambient conditions, upon reduction of the metal atom ­ ligand dissociates from the metal. Hence, the oxidation state of +4 is attainable but only under elevated temperatures (over 120 ºC).78,85

! Scheme 4.2 Allylation of para-substituted benzaldehydes catalyzed by 9b. A preliminary study into the allylation reaction was studied with three para-substituted benzaldehydes (10a-c) and allyltributyltin (as the allyl group source) catalyzed by previously described Pd-NNN pincer complex, 9b. To each of the aldehydes, a solution of 9b in THF was added following the addition of 1.2 equiv. of allyltributyltin. The reaction solution was stirred in air at 60 ºC. After 24 h the reaction solution still appeared yellow in colour (suggesting no catalyst decomposition) and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. The resulting yellow waxy compounds were characterized using
1

H NMR spectroscopy to determine the % conversion (see Table 4.1 and Figure A62). 40

Both benzaldehyde and p-nitrobenzaldehyde showed high conversion to the desired product (entries 1 and 5, Table 4.1) with the aldehyde peak not present. pMethoxybenzaldehyde was converted in 76% (entry 3, Table 4.1). However, even though an unreacted aldehyde was observed in the spectrum, there was no unreacted allyltributyltin compound present. This could be due to an error in the amounts of the reagents added when the reaction was set-up. Table 4.1 Pd-NNN pincer complex-catalyzed allylation of select aldehydes. Entry R Yield (%)a 1 NO2 99 2b NO2 0 3 OCH3 76 4b OCH3 0 5 H 99 6b H 0 a 1 not isolated yields (determined from H NMR); b no catalyst used; As stated previously, the reaction studied in Scheme 4.2 has been of a preliminary interest. So far in literature, only Pd pincer complexes with symmetric PCP type ligands have shown progress in these types of catalytic transformations.86 Herein we demonstrated asymmetric Pd-NNN type pincer complex as a successful catalyst. Table 4.2 outlines the chemical shifts for the allylation of aldehydes reaction. It should be noted that no acidic work-up or product isolation took place.

! Scheme 4.3 A proposed mechanism for the allylation of aldehydes. DFT calculations,86 show that the mechanism of this catalytic process involves transmetallation step to happen first on a relatively electron poor palladium centre. The electrophilic attack happens at the -position of the allyl group in the second step. This is driven by electronic (not steric) factors. And as the final step, product dissociation and catalyst regeneration happens. Importantly, no change in oxidation state of palladium takes place during the three steps of the catalytic process (Scheme 4.3). 42

CHAPTER 5 ­ EXPERIMENTAL 5.1 GENERAL All reactions were carried out under ambient atmosphere conditions unless otherwise stated. All chemicals were purchased commercially. All of the reagents were used without further purification. Solvents used for reactions were supplied by an mBraun Solvent Purification System (SPS) or in commercial bottles (Aldrich), none of which were further purified. Compounds 1 and 5 were synthesized according to literature49. NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 400 using CDCl3 (chloroformd1) at 400 MHz (1H), 162 MHz (31P) and 100 MHz (13C) at RT. In all spectra, chemical shifts were adjusted to the solvent peak (7.26 ppm for CHCl3 for 1H and 77.16 ppm for CDCl3 for
13

C). Melting points were determined using Fisher Scientific melting point

apparatus with the maximum temperature of 300 °C. The values provided for melting point are uncorrected. IR spectra were obtained on Perkin Elmer Spectrum One using KBr disks for solid compounds and NaCl disks for liquid/oil compounds. SiliCycle Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) plates (thickness: 250 µm) were used for TLC characterization; visualization was obtained under UV light irridiation. Some of the products (as specified) were purified by dry-column flash chromatography (DCFC). The general procedure included the sample being adsorbed onto silica (~3 g) followed by rotary evaporation. Then, a 100 mL sintered glass funnel was packed with clean silica (~12 g) and then topped with the compound-adsorbed silica sample. Fractions were collected individually by applying vacuum. Each fraction consisted of total 25 mL of the solvent mixture, starting from 25 mL of hexanes and increasing the polarity by adding 1 mL of EtOAc with each consecutive fraction (e.g. fraction #2: 24 mL of hexanes and 1 43

mL of EtOAc). Theoretical calculations were performed on Spartan'10 at B3LYP: 6311++G** level of theory. 5.2 LIGANDS 2-Chloro-N-(2-(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)phenyl)acetamide (2)

Molecular weight: 266.72 g mol-1 The solution of 1 (1.70 g, 8.90 mmol) and triethylamine (1.86 mL, 13.3 mmol) in DCM (25 mL) was placed into an ice bath and stirred for 15 min. 2-Chloroacetyl chloride (0.78 mL, 9.8 mmol) was then added dropwise over the period of 5 min to the stirring solution. Upon the completion of addition, the contents of the reaction vessel were stirred for 2 h at RT. Over that period of time, the colour of the solution changed from yellow to orange and finally to deep red; a pale pink precipitate was also noted. After 2 h, the dark red solution was gravity filtered and the filtrate was left to evaporate overnight (fumehood). Dark brown crystals formed and were then washed with Et2O (20 mL), resulting in an orange solution and a black-coloured precipitate. The mixture was gravity filtered. Following solvent removal the product was isolated as orange crystalline solid (2.02 g, 85% yield; pure): Mp 97-99 °C; Rf = 0.62 (hexanes-EtOAc, 4:1). IR (KBr): 2953, 1675, 1639, 1609, 1589, 1535, 1450, 1355, 1303, 1057, 1046, 959, 776, 690 cm-1.

CHAPTER 6 ­ CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK A modular approach towards synthesis of novel asymmetric achiral and chiral pincer ligands of NNN, NNC and NNP types was developed. Fifteen novel pincer ligands have been synthesized following the method developed; showcasing the ease and the accessibility towards the presence of different functional groups. The investigation towards the complexation of these pincer ligands was performed with Pd and Ni metal centres. However, only Pd complexes were successfully synthesized from 42-98% yield and characterized by elemental analysis, and NMR spectroscopy. A catalytic study was performed using 9b (5 mol%) in allylation of benzaldehyde, p-nitrobenzaldehyde, and pmethoxybenzaldehyde. The preliminary results showed successful conversion of up to 99%. As part of the future work, both chiral and achiral pincer complexes can be screened for catalytic activity with the above described (allylation of aldehydes) and other types of reactions. Chiral derivatives of these ligands are of immense interest due to their ability to catalyze reactions with stereospecific products.
