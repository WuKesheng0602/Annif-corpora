Introduction"

Producing" food" directly" in" cities" is" one" of" many" civil" society" responses" to" the" increasing" concerns" surrounding" environmental" sustainability," food" security," Carbon"emissions,"loss"of"arable"land"and"the"proliferation"of"the"industrialized"food" production" system." While" a" barrier" to" urban" food" production" is" access" to" suitable" growing"space,"a"multitude"of"diverse"food"production"activities"offer"options"in"the" most"concentrated"areas"of"population."An"emerging"innovation"that"addresses"this" need" for" space" in" cities" is" rooftop" urban" agriculture" (RUA)." RUA" is" the" practice" of" growing" food" on" the" otherwise" unproductive" space" on" buildings," and" as" such," merges" the" practices" of" urban" agriculture" and" green" roofs." As" one" of" the" many" incarnations" of" urban" agriculture," RUA" initiatives" are" appearing" in" urban" areas" across"the"globe,"such"as"London,"Paris,"Singapore,"New"York,"as"well"as"Vancouver" and"Toronto."RUA"has"started"to"pique"the"interest"of"civil"society"groups"up"to"the" level" of" municipal" policy" makers," being" an" emerging" practice" with" significant" potential"social,"environmental"and"economic"benefits." RUA" is" increasing" in" popularity" and" is" positioned" to" gain" further" recognition" and" adoption" in" the" coming" decades," as" global" environmental" concerns," population" increase," and" issues" surrounding" food" production" deepen." This" presents" rooftop" agriculture" as" an" exciting" innovation" at" the" very" early" stages" of" its" development," offering"a"chance"to"research"an"emerging"practice"that"has"potential"to"be"part"of"a" creative"and"sustainable"urban"food"system"in"the"not"too"distant"future."" While" conducting" preliminary" research" on" the" topic" of" rooftop" agriculture," it" was" found" that" only" a" small" number" of" studies" have" made" mention" of" the" practice" in" Toronto" (Kaill^Vinish," 2009;" Corey," 2013;" Mandel," 2013)." Only" one" report" focuses" " 1" "

specifically"on"RUA"best"practices"(Cascone,"2014)."This"lack"of"research"is"likely"due" to"the"very"recent"emergence"of"this"activity"in"the"city,"making"it"difficult"to"get"a" clear" picture" of" the" extent" of" its" development." Despite" there" being" several" RUA" projects"already"established"in"the"city,"even"informal"inquiries"with"members"of"the" urban" agriculture" and" green" roofs" communities" revealed" only" vague" awareness" of" them." Unlike" these" two" established" groups," RUA" was" found" to" lack" a" defined" organization"or"network"to"unite"its"projects,"as"well"as"a"place"in"municipal"policy."" This" lack" of" information" presented" a" unique" opportunity" to" research" RUA" establishment"in"Toronto,"as"a"snapshot"in"the"development"of"a"new"form"of"urban" agriculture," and" its" community" of" practitioners." This" highlighted" the" need" for" an" essential" first" step" of" exploring" the" RUA" network" through" a" social" network" assessment." This" approach" provides" an" opportunity" to" better" understand" who" is" practicing"RUA,"and"how"or"if"these"actors"are"connecting"with"one"another"to"share" their" experience" and" knowledge" of" this" innovation." Simply" put," are" new" projects" "reinventing" the" wheel"" rather" than" participating" in" a" community" and" benefiting" from"the"expertise"of"others?" " Several"concepts"are"explored"in"this"research"to"better"frame"the"emergence"of"RUA" in" Toronto," including:" green" roofs" and" urban" agriculture," rooftop" agriculture," alternative" food" networks" and" civic" food" networks," and" social" networks." These" subjects"are"presented"beginning"at"a"broad,"conceptual"level,"narrowing"to"the"city^ level"to"illustrate"their"relevance"to"Toronto's"unique"RUA"experience,"and"finally"to" the"network"level,"made"up"of"local"RUA"actors."The"strength"of"cohesion"within"this" network" is" analyzed," with" consideration" to" the" implications" that" this" has" on" its" development,"and"the"level"of"engagement"it"has"with"municipal"decision"makers." " " 2" "

This"research"examines"urban"agriculture"and"green"roofs"as"the"points"of"origin"for" RUA"in"Toronto"as"well"as"the"policy"mechanisms"in"place"to"support"them,"as"RUA" itself"has"no"direct"policy"backing."This"forms"the"basis"of"a"discussion"on"potential" entry" points" for" RUA" in" Toronto's" policy" objectives," as" the" municipal" government" has"the"opportunity"to"be"a"key"network"actor"in"support"of"RUA."Furthermore,"this" research"situates"RUA"within"the"literature"of"food"network"theory,"specifically"the" concept" of" the" civic" food" network" (CFN)" put" forward" by" Renting" et# al." (2012)," through"examining"the"local"RUA"community"and"the"values"driving"the"emergence" of" this" innovation." Finally," recommendations" are" provided" suggesting" how" those" practicing"RUA"in"Toronto"can"seek"to"strengthen"this"emerging"CFN." In"short,"this"research"seeks"to"accomplish"the"following"objectives:" 1."To"determine"who"are"involved"as"network"actors"(individuals,"organizations," interest" groups," municipal" decision" makers," and" others)" in" Toronto's" RUA" community;"" 2." "To" identify" to" what" extent" practitioners" are" connected" for" the" purpose" of" sharing"knowledge"(using"three"project"case"studies);"" 3." "To" position" RUA" within" the" literature" of" food" network" theory" by" identifying" this"emerging"community"as"a"civic"food"network;"" 4."To"provide"recommendations"to"those"within"the"network"in"order"to"promote" and" improve" greater" connectivity" and" cohesion" for" the" benefit" of" this" emerging" movement."

Elements"of"a"New"Network"

RUA"finds"its"origins"in"the"practices"of"urban"agriculture"and"green"roofs."This"work" outlines" a" background" to" these" practices," including" benefits" that" they" offer" (social," environmental" and" economic)," as" well" as" the" values" that" their" advocates" feel" that" they" represent." As" one" of" many" practices" under" the" umbrella" of" urban" agriculture," RUA"reflects"the"motivations"and"values"of"those"who"practice"it."The"concept"of"the" alternative" food" network" (AFN)" and" the" more" recent" theoretical" framework" of" the" civic" food" network" (CFN)," are" explored" to" provide" context" for" RUA's" development." This" offers" an" academic" classification" to" define" RUA" as" a" unique" group" within" the" greater" food" system." The" specific" network" structure," including" the" actors," their" connections," and" their" roles," draws" on" social" network" analysis" (SNA)" as" a" tool" to" analyze"these"interactions"and"draw"meanings"from"them."All"of"these"concepts"are" explored"in"the"following"section"in"order"to"provide"the"context"for"Toronto's"RUA" community,"as"well"as"the"background"knowledge"and"tools"for"its"analysis."" 2.1 Urban"Agriculture"

A"great"deal"of"scholarship"has"emerged"addressing"the"unsustainable"ways"that"our" food"is"being"produced,"and"how"large^scale"industrial"agriculture"is"contributing"to" environmental" degradation" and" climate" change" (Weis," 2007;" Millstone" &" Lang," 2008;" Roberts," 2008;" Steel," 2009)." Many" authors" and" researchers" express" concern" over" how" food" production" levels" will" meet" the" needs" of" the" growing" global" population"in"the"coming"decades"(Hodgson,"Campbell,"&"Bailkey,"2011;"Elton,"2013;" Gaus,"2013)." " Prime"North"American"agricultural"land"is"being"lost"to"development"at"thirty^seven" acres"(14.97"hectares)"per"hour"(de"la"Salle"&"Holland,"2010),"yet"this"runs"counter" " 4" "

to"production"needs."According"to"the"FAO""food"production"will"have"to"increase"by" 70%"by"2050"to"feed"a"population"headed"toward"9.1"billion"people""(Ladner,"2011)." Typically," large" agri^business" companies" that" grow" food" at" an" industrial" scale" use" intensive"chemical"inputs"and"cause"degradation"to"non^renewable"resources"such" as"soil"and"water"(Weis,"2007)."Fears"arise"due"to"the"unknown"long^term"impacts"of" genetically" modified" organisms" (GMOs)," the" industrial" production" from" large" agricultural" transnational" corporations" (TNCs)" (Weis," 2007)," and" the" threats" to" biodiversity" from" gene" patenting" of" germplasm" (Shiva," 2000)," among" many" other" issues." The" "meatification"" of" diets" (Weis," 2007)," referring" to" the" increased" consumption"of"animal"protein"in"the"Western"diet,"a"trend"which"is"now"spreading" to"Asia"and"India,"presents"sustainability"issues"over"how"to"feed"over"seven"billion" hungry" carnivores" (Ladner," 2011)." These" are" among" some" of" the" most" pressing" concerns" resulting" from" the" 20th" century's" industrial" food" production" legacy." As" Roberts" (2008)" explains," these" are" connected" parts" of" a" food" system" rather" than" independent" issues." Many" authors" and" researchers" argue" that" to" address" these" environmentally"destructive"side"effects"of"the"current"system,"a"shift"is"needed.""We" have" collectively" become" aware" that" the" food" system" we" take" for" granted" has..." problems" so" big" that" we" might" have" to" reinvent" the" food" system" altogether" if" we" want"the"world's"population"to"stay"fed"and"healthy"for"another"century""(de"la"Salle" &"Holland,"2010)."" " The" concept" of" "food" miles"" (Millstone" &" Lang," 2008)" focuses" on" the" carbon" emissions"from"long"distance"transport"of"food,"and"is"a"key"argument"for"why"food" should" be" produced" closer" to" the" urban" consumer." Weis" calls" for" the" break" with" industrial"farming"and"instead"advocates""[a]gricultural"efficiency"and"the"ecological" rationality" of" small" farming"" as" a" long" term" strategy" for" sustaining" a" growing" population."Friedmann"(2006)"identifies"local"supply"chains"and"close"proximity"to" " 5" "

urban" consumers" as" being" crucial" to" sustainability." A" less" technical," but" no" less" concerning" byproduct" of" the" industrialized" food" system" is" the" disconnection" that" consumers"have"from"how"and"where"their"food"is"produced."The"result"is"that"many" urbanites" do" not" know" how" food" is" grown," or" how" to" do" it" themselves," and" many" long"for"a"way"to"reconnect"and"re^familiarize"themselves"with"food"(Ladner,"2011;" Cockrall^King,"2012)."These"authors"may"focus"on"parts"of"the"food"system,"such"as" production" shipping" or" consumption," as" they" relate" to" the" environment," but" ultimately" come" to" the" same" conclusion:" to" bring" more" production" into" the" urban" realm"in"order"to"combat"existing"issues." ! Urban"food"production"is"being"presented"as"a"response"to"crisis."Simply"put,"urban" agriculture"is"a"term"to"describe"a"range"of"farming"or"growing"activities"that"result" in" food" being" produced" within" urban" and" peri^urban" areas," and" includes" "the" growing," processing" and" distribution" of" food" and" food^related" products" (GrowTO," 2012)." It" "entails" the" production" of" food" for" personal" consumption," education," donation,"or"sale"and"includes"associated"physical"and"organizational"infrastructure," policies," and" programs" within" urban," suburban," and" rural" built" environments"" (Hodgson," Campbell," &" Bailkey," 2011)." This" identifies" the" social," spatial," political," economic,"and"network"dimensions"of"this"wide^reaching"activity.""" " Urban"agriculture"is"now"being"viewed"by"many"as"an"essential"part"of"a"reformed" system" of" sustainable" production" to" combat" climate" change," environmental" degradation," food" insecurity" (Cockrall^King," 2012)," and" economic" inequality" (Roberts," 2008;" Gorgolewski," Komisar" &" Nasr," 2011)." Research" shows" that" "nearly" 90%" of" Canada's" population" growth" is" concentrated" in" large" metropolitan" areas"" (MacRae" et#al.,"2010),"yet"Toronto,"being"the"largest"of"Canada's"cities,"is"estimated" to"have"only"a"three"day"supply"of"perishable"foods"should"a"disaster"occur"(Lue"&" " 6" "

Koc," 1999;" MacRae" et# al." 2010)." Environmental" and" economic" factors" also" mingle" with"the"ethical,"resulting"in"many"urban"dwellers"seeking"more"control"over"what" they"eat"and"how"they"impact"the"planet."A"simple"desire"for"closer"connections"to" food" has" brought" a" variety" of" agricultural" activities" into" the" urban" realm," making" "grow"your"own""initiatives"trendy"as"an"urban"activity"(Veen,"Derkzen,"&"Wiskerke," 2012)."" " The" most" common" and" established" forms" of" urban" agriculture" by" far" are" small" community" based" efforts," such" as" community" gardens" (Figure" 1)," allotments" for" subsistence" (Figure" 2)," and" the" conversion" of" front" and" back" yards" into" small" plot" intensive" (SPIN)" gardens" (Figure" 3)" (de" la" Salle" &" Holland," 2010)." The" need" to" produce"food"in"cities"will"likely"become"more"appealing"in"the"coming"decades"as" urban" population" density" increases," resulting" in" innovations" in" the" ways" in" which" urban" agriculture" is" practiced," as" well" as" where" it" takes" place." RUA" presents" just" such" an" innovation," using" technology" to" grow" food" on" city" roof" space." Rooftop" agriculture" as" an" emerging" form" of" urban" agriculture" is" appearing" in" a" number" of" forms," including" intensive" rooftop" agriculture" (Figure" 4)," rooftop" greenhouses" (Figure"5),"container"gardening"(Figure"6),"and"combinations"of"the"above."

In" an" effort" to" move" away" from" conventional" vertical" structures" of" food" provisioning," new" horizontal" models" have" emerged" as" "a" part" of" a" wider" social" movement" countering" the" various" unsustainabilites" evoked" by" prevailing" food" regimes"" (Roep" &" Wiskerke," 2012)." Rather" than" food" being" grown" at" industrial" scales" by" corporate" organizations," horizontal" networks" seek" to" "link" small^scale" producers" in" subregional" learning" and" innovation" networks" that" can" foster" endogenous"growth""(Watts,"Ilbery,"&"Maye,"2005)."General"examples"of"horizontal" food" models" include" community" supported" agriculture" (CSA)" basket" schemes," farmers'" markets," food" cooperatives," as" well" as" community" gardens" (Parkins" &" Craig," 2009;" Veen," Derkzen," &" Wiskerke," 2012)." While" not" income" generating," community" gardens" allow" for" individual" gardeners" to" reduce" reliance" on" conventional" vertical" food" structures." Commercial" producers" in" horizontal" models" would" be" Gotham" Greens," the" Brooklyn" Grange" and" Navy" Yard," and" Lufa" farms." These" projects" produce" and" sell" food" in" their" direct" local" areas," typically" through" CSA" basket" schemes" or" at" local" farmers'" markets," rather" than" through" affiliations" with"large"market"retailers,"and"with"minimal"transportation."" Koc" et# al." (1999)" point" out" that" industrial" structures" often" ignore" the" potential" of" smaller^scale," local" production" chains." These" segmentations" of" the" larger" food" market"into"smaller,"more"horizontal"network"components"(Watts,"Ilbery,"&"Maye," 2005)" have," since" the" 1990s," become" known" as" alternative" food" networks" (AFN)," alternative"agro^food"networks"(AAFNs)"(Goodman,"2004),"Short"Agro^Food"Supply" Chains" (SAFSCs)" (Volpentesta," Ammirato," &" Della" Galla," 2013)," and" localized" agri^ food" systems" (Renting," Schermer," &" Rossi," 2012)." AFNs" can" be" defined" as" creating" food" provisioning" networks" that" are" alternative" to" conventional" options," either" spatially" through" shorter" supply" chains," socially" through" increased" community" connection." AFNs" can" also" include" alternative" production" methods" (Jarosz," 2008;" " 24" "

Veen," Derkzen," &" Wiskerke," 2012)," such" as" organics," and" fair" trade" foods." As" alternatives" to" the" conventional" food" system," these" options" may" offer" a" more" sustainable" journey" from" seed" to" table."

Non^commercial" RUA" activities" may" be" classified" along" with" other" forms" of" urban" agriculture" as" one" of" many" incarnations" of" an" AFN" due" to" being" an" agricultural" practice" outside" of" the" greater" food" system." However," due" to" the" nature" of" RUA" being" largely" civil" society^based," non^profit," and" values" driven," this" community" appears,"for"reasons"discussed"in"further"detail"below,"to"reflect"the"recent"updated" food" network" concept" of" the" civic" food" network" (CFN)." The" concepts" of" AFNs" and" CFNs" address" the" values," motivations" and" characteristics" of" particular" food" initiatives"as"elements"that"make"up"a"local"food"system."" Since" the" study" of" AFNs" began" in" the" 1990s," certain" shortcomings" have" been" associated" with" this" approach" to" analysis" of" food" networks." Renting" et# al." (2012)" note" that" a" lack" of" normative" content" makes" the" concept" of" an" AFN" vague," being" simply" alternative" to" conventional" food" chains," or" at" least" "minimizing" their" involvement" with" conventional" food" chains"" (Jarosz," 2008)." The" very" concept" of" what" constitutes" alternativeness" is" vague" and" often" changing;" for" example," once" viewed"as"alternative,"organic"or"fair"trade"produce"have"become"more"mainstream" and" are" therefore" debated" as" to" their" perceived" alternative" status" (Renting," Schermer,"&"Rossi,"2012)."Also,"while"AFNs"seek"to"present"an"alternative"option"to" the"greater"food"system,"they"typically"function"on"a"similar"business"model,"being" for^profit,"albeit"often"on"a"smaller"scale"(Jarosz,"2008)." "Jarosz" (2008)" notes" that" AFNs" can" be" limiting" and" exclusionary," and" may" not" necessarily"present"more"progressive"views"of"race,"gender,"class,"or"equity"in"their" production,"over"their"industrial"counterparts."Renting"et#al."(2012)"echo"this,"noting" that"the"framework"for"AFNs"often"fail"to"recognize""relevant"underlying"dynamics"," specifically,"the"significant"role"of"citizen"participation"and""governance"mechanisms" rooted"in"civil"society"."Psarikidou"and"Szerszynski"(2012)"observe"that"research"on" the" social" ties" within" food" initiatives" is" often" neglected."

Based"on"the"shortcomings"of"AFNs,"an"evolution"of"the"concept"has"been"proposed" by" Renting" et# al." (2012)" in" order" to" target" the" unique" circumstances" surrounding" localized,"and"smaller^scale"short"food"supply"chains,"called"the"Civic"Food"Network" (CFN)."While"CFNs"inevitably"share"many"common"links"to"its"predecessor,"such"as" the"shifting"societal"values"that"drive"the"desire"for"new"food"options,"the"concept"of" the" CFN" was" developed" to" take" account" of" the" civil^society" activities" driving" a" specific"food"network."! Renting," Schermer" and" Rossi" (2012)" present" the" following" key" points" as" defining" aspects"of"the"CFN"as"a"new"approach"to"analyzing"food"networks:" 1. "Often" cities" are" the" starting" point" for" food^system" innovations" associated" with"CFNs;" 2.

The" defining" elements" of" a" CFN" reflect" many" aspects" of" community^based" urban" agriculture" initiatives," including" the" values" and" connections" driving" RUA" (see" section" 4.8)."

3.1.1 Urban"Agriculture"in"Toronto" The"City"of"Toronto"has"been"active"in"its"urban"agriculture"efforts"since"establishing" Canada's" first" food" policy" council" in" 1991" through" the" Board" of" Health" (now," Toronto" Public" Health)" as" a" response" to" a" civic" call" for" urban" agriculture" engagement."Most"recently,"the"TFPC"along"with"Toronto"Urban"Growers"(TUG)"and" the"City"of"Toronto"has"led"the"implementation"of"the"Toronto"Agricultural"Program," based"on"the"objectives"and"recommendations"outlined"in"the"2012"Grow"TO"Urban" Agriculture" Action" Plan" for" Toronto." Numerous" local" food" groups" exist" in" the" city" (FoodShare,"Carrot"Common,"Cultivate"T.O,"Second"Harvest,"Not"Far"From"the"Tree," the"Toronto"Community"Gardener's"Network,"Toronto"Urban"Growers"(TUG)."All"of" these" organizations" show" that" there" exists" in" Toronto" a" strong" interest" in" urban" agriculture" and" food," and" that" these" proponents" offer" a" large" base" of" social" capital" driving" its" development." Despite" this," the" development" of" rooftop" agriculture" lags" behind" other" forms" of" urban" agriculture" initiatives" (Section" 2.1)" in" the" amount" of" attention" it" receives," particularly" in" municipal" policy." Currently" RUA" is" mentioned" only" as" a" small" part" the" Grow" TO" report" (GrowTO," 2012)," although" some" research" presents"RUA"as"a"part"of"a"diversified"urban"food"production"solution"for"the"city."

3.1.2 Green"Roofs"in"Toronto" In"2009,"the"city"of"Toronto"became"the"first"municipality"in"North"America"to"adopt" a" Green" Roof" bylaw" (City" of" Toronto," Municipal" Code" Chapter" 492," Green" Roofs," 2009)."

The" City's" experience"with"implementing"this"bylaw,"and"the"connections"that"green"roofs"have" to" RUA" make" Toronto" an" interesting" case" study," as" this" may" show" an" openness" to" RUA"as"an"expression"of"green"roofs,"and"a"policy"approach"to"parallel.""

Doshi" et# al." (2005)"found"that"cost"savings"due"to"improved"storm"water"management,"energy" and"UHI"reduction"were"the"most"significant"areas"of"potential"cost"savings,"making" these"the"guiding"motivations"for"the"content"of"the"green"roof"bylaw's"development." To"encourage"the"application"of"green"roofs,"the"city"developed"the"LiveGreen"Eco^ Roof" Incentive" Program," which" provides" financial" incentives" for" installing" green" " 36" "

roofs"on"structures"that"meet"certain"criteria"(Livegreen"Toronto"EcoRoof"Incentive" Program,"n.d)." " The"Green"Roofs"bylaw"has"led"to"significant"growth"in"the"number"of"green"roofs"in" the" city." This" increase" has" been" documented" through" an" annual" "Green" Roofs" Industry" Survey"" conducted" by" Green" Roofs" for" Healthy" Cities" since" 2004." These" surveys"document"the"total"amount"of"green"roof"coverage"(in"square"feet)"installed" by"its"industry"members"annually"in"major"metropolitan"areas"in"Canada"(Figure"10)" and" North" America," as" well" as" the" types" of" green" roofs" being" installed." It" is" clear" from" this" figure" that" Toronto" is" the" Canadian" leader" in" green" roof" installation," but" these" numbers" are" primarily" due" to" the" presence" of" extensive" green" roofs," which" predominate"the"installations"in"Canadian"cities,"including"Toronto"(Green"Roofs"for" Healthy"Cities,"2013)."

The" bylaw" framework," however," contains"interpretive"wording"that"would"appear"to"exclude"food"production"on"an" intensive" green" roof" as" being" considered" as" a" green" roof" under" the" terms" of" the" bylaw."The"bylaw"requires"that""[t]he"plant"selection"and"design"shall"be"such"that" within"three"years"of"the"planting"date"the"selected"plants"shall"cover"no"less"than" 80%" of" the" vegetated" roof"" (City" of" Toronto," Municipal" Code" Chapter" 492," Green" Roofs,"2009)."Unfortunately,"it"would"seem"that"it"would"not"be"possible"for"rooftop" food" production" operations" to" meet" this" requirement," due" to" the" need" for" most" crops"to"be"sown,"picked"and"replanted"yearly."Based"on"this,"there"is"concern"that" RUA" systems" will" not" have" the" stormwater" retention" benefits" that" a" typical" extensive" green" roof" systems" would" have" in" its" place" (Jane" Welsh," personal" correspondence," 2014)."

" Questions" relating" to" city" policies"and"any"areas"of"possible"municipal"involvement"in"RUA"were"also"asked"in" a" way" which" made" them" specific" to" the" projects" which" the" practitioners" were" involved"with."As"with"the"Key"Informants,"Practitioners"were"asked"is"they"had"any" further"questions"or"comments"as"a"final"question"to"allow"them"to"expand"on"their" project" experience" beyond" what" was" asked" in" the" interview." The" selection" of" participants"for"the"Practitioner"interviews"is"discussed"in"Section"3.1.6."" 3.1.5 Participant"Selection"and"Recruitment:"Group"1:"'Key"Informants'" Due"to"the"nature"of"rooftop"agriculture"in"Toronto"as"an"emerging"practice,"the"pool" of" individuals" to" draw" upon" for" both" Key" Informants" and" Practitioners" was" quite" small."

followed"a"selection"process"based"primarily"on"a""hierarchy"of"credibility""(Van"Den" Hoonaard,"2012)."Individuals"identified"as"prospective"participants"were"those"who" had" close" connections" to" RUA" (for" example," as" researchers," food" advocates," public" servants," policy" makers)," as" well" as" practical" experience" (an" essential" point" for" practitioner"selection,"as"is"discussed"below)."Early"conversations"with"researchers" and"advisors"at"Ryerson"and"the"Toronto"Food"Policy"Council/Toronto"Public"Health" provided" guidance" for" this" portion" of" the" research," through" recommending" particular"key"players"who"are"involved"in"RUA"in"some"capacity."" " Considering" the" main" goal" from" this" interview" group" was" to" determine" who" is" involved" in" the" RUA" network," having" a" variety" of" participants" with" different" professional"backgrounds"and"links"to"the"industry"was"determined"to"be"necessary." To" accomplish" this," the" Key" Informants" group" was" made" up" of" a" range" of" professions," each" with" some" connection" to" rooftop" agriculture" in" the" city," such" as" municipal" employees" involved" with" policies" and" programs" relating" to" RUA" (specifically" urban" agriculture" or" green" roofs)," city" planners," members" of" the" Toronto" Food" Policy" Council," researchers," experts" working" in" the" green" roof" industry,"as"well"as"not^for^profit"advocacy"and"education"groups." In" addition" to" the" above" selection" methods," initial" recruitment" of" Key" Informants" was" also" based" partially" on" a" snowball" approach," which" allowed" for" network" connections"to"be"followed,"revealing"connections"and"channels"of"influence"within" the" RUA" community" by" way" of" the" interview" participants." Through" recommendations" and" referrals" from" advisors," listing" names" of" individuals" that" surfaced" often" in" local" reports" and" studies" of" green" roofs," and" also" in" informal" discussions"with"participants"in"the"urban"agriculture"and"green"roofs"communities," a" larger" pool" of" local" experts" was" generated." Based" on" the" relevance" of" their" experience" and" level" of" involvement" with" RUA," some" of" these" recommended" " 43" "

individuals" were" contacted" and" asked" for" their" participation." Conversely," some" individuals" were" not" contacted" because" their" involvement" in" the" RUA" community" was" determined" to" not" be" somewhat" peripheral" or" vague," or" because" their" career" path"had"changed"in"recent"years,"thus"reducing"their"connection"to"RUA"in"Toronto."" Part"of"the"structure"of"the"interview"questions"for"both"groups"involved"asking"for" additional"names"of"individuals"or"organizations"that"they"had"been"in"contact"with" or"aware"of"in"the"RUA"network."On"a"number"of"occasions,"interview"participants" recommended"the"names"of"other"people"to"interview,"and"in"some"cases"facilitated" introductions" to" prospective" participants" who" they" knew" to" be" involved" in" the" network." This" method" allowed" the" number" of" interviews" to" increase," and" to" gain" greater"insight"into"existing"connections,"as"well"as"to"improve"the"accuracy"of"the" network" analysis." This" was" particularly" helpful" in" order" to" increase" the" number" of" interviews" when" several" initial" selections" failed" to" respond" or" declined" to" participate." Requesting"interviews"was"often"done"in"person,"if"the"prospective"participant"was" present" at" a" commonly" attended" meeting," for" example," and" this" was" followed" up" with" an" email" containing" more" information" on" the" research" project," ethics," and" possible"meeting"times."Some"requests"were"made"by"email,"such"as"in"the"case"of"an" e^introduction" from" another" participant," or" when" sending" a" request" to" an" already" known"contact."In"this"case"of"a"referral"without"an"introduction"from"the"interview" participant," the" prospective" participant" was" informed" that" they" were" being" contacted" by" recommendation" of" a" mutual" acquaintance" for" their" expertise" in" the" area" of" research."

4.2.1 Barriers" In" order" to" understand" challenges" being" faced" in" RUA," during" the" interviews," Key" Informants" were" asked" to" discuss" what" barriers" they" felt" existed" which" were" hindering"RUA"in"Toronto."These"are"represented"in"Table"6,"as"they"emerged"from" the" Key" Informant" interviews." The" most" common" barriers" identified" by" the" Key" Informant" group" were" funding" and" cost" of" establishment," structural" and" technical" issues," interpersonal" network" issues," and" the" lack" of" supportive" municipal" policy" structures"for"RUA."" " Nearly" all" participants" acknowledged" the" high" cost" of" establishing" a" rooftop" agriculture"project"as"being"a"barrier."These"costs,"as"referenced"by"the"participants," may"include"preliminary"structural"assessments"and"the"possible"reinforcing"of"the" roof" to" make" it" sufficiently" load" bearing," the" purchase" of" growing" and" landscaping" materials," transportation" of" materials" onto" the" rooftop," safety" installations" and" railings," irrigation" infrastructure," and" liability" insurance."Since" the" RUA" projects" in" Toronto"are"non^commercial,"financial"returns"from"produce"sales"are"not"a"reliable" or" significant" source" of" income" to" maintain" projects." Access" to" rooftops" and" safety" concerns"were"also"mentioned"as"potential"issues,"particularly"on"buildings"owned" by"a"company"or"third"party"not"involved"with"the"rooftop"project."Financing"a"costly" project" brings" forth" the" question" of" access" to" funding" sources." The" Key" Informant" participants" were" unclear" overall" about" possible" sources" of" funding," with" the" exception"of"those"who"were"City"of"Toronto"employees.""" ! The" most" significant" issue" that" participants" felt" to" be" holding" back" RUA" in" the" city" was"the"lack"of"interest"or"support"on"the"part"of"the"municipal"government."Notable" barriers" include" the" lack" of" specific" policies," programs," funding" mechanisms," and" information" targeting" RUA" as" a" practice." Where" a" relevant" and" potentially" overlapping"policy"exists,"that"being"the"Green"Roof"Bylaw,"it"excludes"RUA,"and"the" " 61" "

city" has" no" plans" to" alter" the" policy" to" make" it" more" inclusive" of" rooftop" food" production."The"Grow"TO"Urban"Agriculture"Action"Plan"and"the"resulting"Toronto" Agricultural" Program" only" includes" RUA" as" a" very" small" part" of" its" scope," with" no" specific"action"plan"for"RUA"on"its"own." " The" Key" Informants" mostly" identified" Toronto's" current" policy" environment" as" being" restrictive" to" rooftop" agriculture." While" there" are" seemingly" logical" opportunities"for"RUA"to"fit"within"the"policy"frameworks,"the"most"obvious"option," being" the" green" roofs" bylaw," does" not" make" reference" to" RUA" or" ways" to" produce" food" on" rooftops." Notably," there" is" quite" a" lot" of" confusion" surrounding" what" the" bylaw"allows"and"what"it"restricts,"in"terms"of"food"production."The"main"restriction" being" the" Green" Roof" Construction" Standard" requirement" to" have" 80%" of" the" available"roof"surface"having"full"plant^coverage"within"three"years"of"establishment" (City" of" Toronto," Green" Roof" Construction" Standard," 2009)." While" the" Green" Roofs" bylaw"is"viewed"as"a"significant"restriction"to"RUA,"many"participants"identified"the" city's" relationship" to" urban" agriculture" as" a" main" hindrance." While" some" find" the" interest"that"the"City"has"in"urban"agriculture"to"be"promising,"most"key"informants" agreed"that"it"was"not"a"significant"priority"for"the"city."" " Several"participants"identified"a"lack"of"knowledge"as"an"issue"that"is"hindering"RUA" development" in" Toronto." This" may" be" a" lack" of" knowledge" of" the" practice" of" RUA" itself"(including"training,"liability"and"insurance),"or"a"lack"of"knowledge"of"available" resources" in" order" to" establish" rooftop" projects." As" an" example," the" language" surrounding" agriculture" and" food" is" completely" absent" from" websites" and" documentation" relating" to" the" Green" Roofs" bylaw" and" the" LiveGreen" EcoRoof" Incentive" program." This" lack" of" information" was" identified" as" a" barrier" for" practitioners," as" it" is" unclear" to" many" whether" food" production" on" rooftops" as" a" " 62" "

practice" is" allowed." This" lack" of" information" was" felt" to" have" the" potential" to" discourage" practitioners," and" sends" a" negative" message" about" the" City's" level" of" support"for"RUA." 4.2.2 Opportunities" Many"groups,"projects,"and"individuals"are"recognizing"the"potential"of"rooftops"as" spaces" for" urban" agriculture," creating" a" broader" range" of" practitioners" and" project" models." Looking" ahead" to" the" future" of" rooftop" agriculture" as" an" urban" food" production"practice,"Key"Informants"offered"many"suggestions"for"the"development" of" RUA" in" Toronto." These" included" next" steps" and" considerations" that" a" new" RUA" network" may" benefit" from," including" organization," communication," and" a" place" for" RUA"in"municipal"policy." " Key"Informants"were"asked"to"share"their"views"on"whether"Toronto's"RUA"efforts" were"perceived"to"be"a"cohesive"network,"and"it"was"unanimously"stated"by"all"key" informants" that" this" was" not" the" case." When" asked" about" whether" RUA" would" benefit" from" having" its" own" formalized" network," answers" varied," although" interestingly," participants" with" common" professional" or" volunteer" experience" shared" similar" views." Academics" who" have" had" experience" working" with" food" groups," including" the" TFPC," reasoned" against" yet" another" stand^alone" advocacy" group."The"rationale"for"this"being"that"with"every"new"group"trying"to"establish"its" own" unique" identity," social" capital" gets" stretched" thin," reducing" the" efficacy" of" the" initiative."Academic"participants"offered"that"one"solution"is"to"have"the"RUA"effort" housed" under" an" already" existing" organization," while" those" working" with" not^for^ profit"food"groups"commonly"suggested"a"stand^alone"RUA"group."The"main"options" brought" forward" as" possible" umbrella" organizations" were" the" Toronto" Urban" Growers"(TUG),"Green"Roofs"for"Healthy"Cities,"and"FoodShare."These"organizations" appear"to"have"some"crossover"interest,"or"even"experience"in"RUA."TUG"was"felt"to" " 63" "

be"a"logical"option"due"to"its"role"as"an"existing"umbrella"organization"with"an"urban" agriculture" focus." However," concerns" were" raised" over" its" broad" mandate" (being" therefore"not"completely"focused"on"RUA),"and"a"perceived"lack"of"cohesion"within" the" organization." Considering" the" perception" that" GRHC" has" a" key" role" and" an" interest"in"RUA,"several"of"the"participants"suggested"that"a"RUA"network"could"be" integrated" into" GRHC." Unfortunately," due" to" Steven" Peck's" admission" that" RUA" is" unlikely"to"become"part"of"the"organization's"mandate"in"the"near"future,"this"seems" improbable."Foodshare"was"also"suggested,"as"its"experience"with"the"SchoolGrown" Rooftop"may"provide"FoodShare"with"particular"insights"about"RUA"establishment."" " The"need"for"communication"and"collaboration"was"expressed"by"all"participants"as" a" requirement" for" developing" the" RUA" network" in" Toronto." Some" suggested" an" online"environment"where"practitioners"and"interested"parties"can"share"ideas"and" best" practices" about" rooftop" agriculture." Academic" conferences" such" as" the" 2012" Urban" Agriculture" Summit" were" identified" as" being" a" valuable" forum" to" bring" together" a" range" of" participants" and" share" information" and" ideas" for" RUA." Key" Informants" discussed" the" need" to" develop" the" RUA" network" through" multiple" connections" among" actors" who" wouldn't" traditionally" collaborate." An" example" provided" by" participants" included" connecting" building" owners" and" community" groups."This"would"bring"together"those"who"own"the"space"and"those"who"have"the" expertise" to" farm" it." One" important" actor" mentioned" often" was" the" municipal" government,"through"its"various"departments"that"have"crossover"to"RUA."The"City" has" an" important" opportunity" to" encourage" RUA" and" break" down" barriers" to" its" development" (such" as" restrictive" bylaws," zoning)." In" order" to" support" RUA" development," the" municipal" government" must" recognize" itself" as" a" network" actor" and" stakeholder" in" RUA," and" take" appropriate" steps" to" supporting" initiatives." The"

"

Toronto"Food"Policy"Council"has"the"potential"to"encourage"RUA"through"the"Grow" TO"Action"Plan"and"the"Toronto"Agricultural"Program." " According" to" participants," part" of" the" development" process" of" a" RUA" network" includes" having" local" champions" to" promote" the" practice" and" bring" other" actors" together."RUA"champions"would"be"best"positioned"to"understand"the"benefits"of"the" practice," share" knowledge" and" build" the" network." While" Key" Informants" were" not" able" to" identify" an" overall" RUA" champion," several" participants" felt" that" project^ specific"champions"were"working"to"develop"individual"RUA"projects."By"connecting" these"small^scale"champions,"there"is"an"opportunity"for"an"overall"RUA"champion"to" emerge"as"a"leader"for"this"emerging"network."" " Participants" noted" that" it" was" unlikely" that" the" City" of" Toronto" would" lead" the" initiative"to"develop"RUA,"making"a"grassroots"effort"an"essential"step."An"organized" RUA" network" of" practitioners" and" supporters" could" mobilize" strategically" to" promote" RUA" to" the" city." While" it" was" acknowledged" that" no" such" initiative" currently"exists,"there"is"a"place"for"an"organized,"determined,"and"cohesive"network" for" RUA" in" the" city." An" example" of" an" organized" network" that" yielded" results" for" policy" development" is" GRHC," as" it" played" a" strong" role" in" providing" research" and" influencing"the"development"of"the"Green"Roof"Bylaw."Over"time"an"organized"RUA" movement" may" be" able" to" parallel" the" experience" of" GRHC," by" providing" expertise" on"the"subject"and"convincing"councillors"of"its"benefits."" " Key" Informants" presented" several" suggestions" regarding" how" to" approach" the" development"of"support"mechanisms"for"RUA"in"Toronto."These"included"creating"a" specific" bylaw" for" RUA," or" a" complimentary" bylaw" to" the" Green" Roof" bylaw." Participants" suggested" that" these" could" be" written" by" academics" within" the" RUA" " 65" "

network" and" presented" to" the" City," as" this" could" expedite" implementation." The" importance" of" financial" resources" provided" by" the" City" was" emphasized," with" possible" sources" being" the" Toronto" Agricultural" Program," the" EcoRoof" Incentive" program,"and"Livegreen"Toronto"Grants."These"approaches"could"also"be"applied"in" combination." 4.2.3 Network/Key"Players" Based"on"participant"interviews,"the"present"state"of"the"RUA"network"in"Toronto"is" described" variously" as" "lacking" in" cohesion,"" "disorganized,"" or" as" most" indicated," simply" non^existent." Some" situated" RUA" within" the" larger" context" of" urban" agriculture," while" some" understood" the" development" of" RUA" as" being" a" new" endeavour" altogether." Unfortunately," many" felt" that" the" lack" of" a" network" is" hindering"the"ability"of"RUA"to"represent"itself"to"Toronto's"municipal"government" and" thereby," make" itself" a" priority" to" decision" makers." Key" Informants" felt" that" certain"projects"have"generated"a"bit"more"awareness"of"RUA"in"the"general"public," but"a"systematic"process"of"improving"visibility"of"the"community"in"a"manner"akin" to"a"movement"or"coordinated"effort"is"lacking." " Key" Informants" identified" the" City" of" Toronto," various" community" food" groups," businesses," non^profits," academic" institutions," individuals" and" RUA" projects" themselves"as"key"players"in"the"RUA"network."Participants"noted"that"interactions" among" people," governments," and" companies" result" in" inequalities" of" power," and" issues"of"gender,"race,"and"class"often"surface"in"civic"networks."As"a"loose"group,"the" RUA" community" appears" to" be" in" an" early" stage" in" its" network" development," discussed" further" in" Section" 4.5." Leadership" opportunities" in" the" network" require" local"champions"for"RUA,"and"potential"for"existing"organizations"(GRHC,"FoodShare," TUG,"as"discussed"above)"to"support"the"RUA"community."The"TFPC"was"often"cited"

"

as" a" mechanism" within" the" Municipal" government" that" could" play" a" key" role" in" pushing"the"RUA"agenda"forward"to"City"Council."" " MacRae" felt" that" the" network" potential" largely" depends" on" what" scale" of" urban" agriculture" is" taking" place." In" the" current" environment" of" small," individually^run" projects,"practitioners"have"the"freedom"to"initiate"new"forms"of"rooftop"gardening" experiments."Looking"at"the"current"stage"in"network"development"and"the"nature" of" existing" projects." This" conversation" of" scale" reflects" Mandel's" (2013)" categorization"of"operational"scales,"being"rooftop"gardening,"moving"up"to"farming," and" increasing" further" to" the" commercial" scale" rooftop" agriculture." With" these" increases" of" scale" come" increases" in" complexity" of" policy" needs," highlighting" the" important" role" of" the" City." Participants" reflected" that" food" advocacy" groups" often" start" out" small," as" is" the" current" case" with" the" RUA" community," being" in" the" early" stages"of"its"development."Interpersonal"dynamics"were"identified"as"an"element"of" network"development"that"may"play"a"role"in"the"development"of"the"RUA"network."" 4.2.4 Food"System" Key"Informants"largely"identified"RUA"as"having"emerged"from"the"City's"green"roofs" and" urban" agriculture" communities." Urban" agriculture" in" Toronto" has" been" driven" forward" by" the" TFPC," and" with" the" endorsement" of" the" Grow" TO" Action" Plan" (GrowTO," 2012)," RUA" was" placed" within" the" context" of" urban" agriculture." While" RUA" is" only" a" small" part" of" the" plan," it" has" nonetheless" been" put" forward" as" one" element"of"Toronto's"greater"food"system,"even"if"only"in"a"preliminary"effort."" " Participant"opinions"on"the"City's"level"of"interest"and"support"for"urban"agriculture" varied"from"token"interest"for"publicity,"to"a"significant"interest"in"supporting"urban" agriculture."Regardless"of"the"actual"level"of"support,"RUA"was"felt"to"be"one"of"many" options" for" urban" agriculture" development" in" the" city." For" RUA" to" be" presented" to" " 67" "

the"City"as"a"viable"urban"agriculture"option,"participants"felt"that"there"needs"to"be" more" information" on" the" social," economic," and" environmental" benefits" of" RUA." By" identifying"RUA's"impact"on"food"security,"job"creation,"and"how"it"could"contribute" to" the" local" food" system," practitioners" would" be" able" to" make" a" stronger" case" for" RUA,"specific"to"the"Toronto"food"system"context."" " RUA"is"being"viewed"as"a"new"expression"of"urban"agriculture,"and"while"its"full"role" may"not"yet"be"clear,"food"interest"groups"have"been"showing"increased"interest"in" RUA" in" recent" years." With" many" people" involved" through" their" roles" in" academia," government," advocacy," as" well" as" with" leading" organizations" in" the" city," RUA" is" gradually" gaining" a" higher" profile." The" 2012" Urban" Agriculture" Summit" was" organized"by"FoodShare,"GRHC,"and"Ryerson"University's"Centre"for"Food"Security," and" so" was" immediately" making" a" connection" between" urban" agriculture," green" roofs,"and"academic"dialogue."" 4.2.5 Values" Those"projects"which"are"established,"including"those"highlighted"in"the"case"studies" below," are" often" spoken" of" as" having" particular" non^monetary" objectives" or" intangibles" as" valued" outcomes." Key" Informants" had" less" insight" into" the" driving" civic" values" of" RUA" relative" to" Practitioners" (Section" 4.3)," but" still" identified" the" desire" for" projects" to" act" as" models" to" others," to" educate," and" bring" together" community."

The"concept"of"community"was"identified"as"a"common"motivation"for"RUA"spaces," as" will" be" illustrated" further" in" Section" 4.3," and" was" identified" by" most" of" the" Key" Informant" participants." Objectives" such" as" education" (eg:" using" RUA" projects" as" classrooms" for" food" and" gardening" education)," and" cultural" connection" (eg:" plants" used" in" Aboriginal" traditional" medicines)" were" given" as" examples" of" how" RUA" can" support"particular"social"values."Bringing"together"community"members,"with"RUA" projects" acting" as" social" hubs," was" expressed" as" one" way" to" add" legitimacy" to" the" practice"through"increase"public"awareness."" 4.2.6 Thematic"Summary:"Key"Informants" As" illustrated" in" Table" 6," and" discussed" throughout" the" section" above," these" interviews"revealed"thirty^four"basic"themes"that"were"categorized"as"they"related" to"barriers,"opportunities,"network/key"players,"food"system,"and"values"of"rooftop" urban" agriculture" establishment" in" Toronto." These" organizational" themes" reflect" a" pragmatic" approach" to" the" existing" network." Table" 6" shows" that" the" greatest" attention"was"given"to"issues,"how"to"overcome"them,"how"RUA"can"fit"into"the"local" food"system,"and"who"is"involved."The"values"driving"rooftop"agriculture"was"less"of" a"focus"for"this"group"than"with"the"Practitioner"group."" " A" systematic" analysis" of" these" themes" revealed" an" underlying" or" "global"" theme" unifying" the" impressions" expressed" by" the" participants." This" global" theme" was" simply"a"pervasive"uncertainty,"throughout"all"current"aspects"of"RUA"in"Toronto,"as" well" as" its" direction" going" forward." The" views" of" the" Key" Informants" implied" an" overall" lack" of" information" and" awareness" of" various" key" components," including" funding"options"and"municipal"resources,"of"network"actors"and"their"roles,"as"well" as" clear" opportunities" for" RUA" in" both" policy" and" network" development" contexts." One"clear"example"is"the"misconception"about"GRHC"and"their"role"in"the"network." While" all" parties" (other" than" Steven" Peck)" agreed" that" GRHC" would" be" a" valuable" " 69" "

resource"as"an"organization"for"RUA"to"be"a"part"of"(and"believe"it"to"be,"currently)," this"belief"is"unfortunately"incorrect."This"simple"misunderstanding"is"illustrative"of" a"lack"of"communication"among"those"involved"with"RUA,"including"practitioners,"as" is"noted"below."" " Considering" that" those" individuals" selected" for" this" work" have" experience" and" connections"to"RUA,"this"uncertainty"and"lack"of"consensus"on"many"points"is"telling" of" the" present" state" of" RUA" in" Toronto." This" impression" reflects" one" point" that" all" participants"agreed"upon,"which"is"that"the"RUA"network"is"lacking"in"cohesion,"and" therefore,"its"many"components"are"lacking"clarity." 4.3 Interviews"^"Group"2:"Practitioners"^"Case"Studies"

4.3.1 Barriers" Each" case" study" project" experienced" difficulties" during" their" implementations" to" varying" degrees." Most" typically" relating" to" communication" and" interpersonal" conflict,"costs,"and"a"lack"of"information"resources." " As"a"community"initiative,"the"Carrot"Green"Roof"experienced"a"two^year"delay"in"its" development"and"implementation"due"to"this"large"number"of"actors"who"could"not" agree" on" a" common" vision" for" the" roof." The" result" was" to" not" have" any" single" unifying"vision,"but"to"instead"represent"an"array"of"rooftop"gardening"expressions." While"the"project"had"the"support"of"the"Carrot"Common"Corporation"as"the"building" owner" (financially," along" with" LiveGreen," and" for" the" use" of" the" space)," it" did" not" dictate" a" vision," but" rather" worked" alongside" community" members," despite" the" conflicts."" " The" Telus" roof" faced" a" significant" restriction" in" terms" of" communication" due" to" corporate" restrictions," which" kept" project" organizers" from" reaching" out" to" community"groups"or"local"government"for"information."The"concern"of"exposing"an" unofficial" plan" to" possible" media" attention," particularly" for" a" well^known" media" corporation"like"Telus,"was"an"issue."Telus'"corporate"structure"also"meant"that"the" volunteer" group" spearheading" the" RUA" project" had" to" seek" approvals" from" many" stakeholders" within" the" organization," often" taking" long" periods" of" time" to" connect" with"the"right"person." " Cost"of"establishment"was"cited"as"an"issue"by"both"CGR"and"Telus,"noting"that"the" cost" to" hire" professionals" (landscape" designers," engineers," architects," professional" gardeners/farmers)"was"significant,"as"were"materials,"transportation"and"staffing." For" this" reason," both" projects" sought" less" costly" in^house" solutions," such" as" using" volunteer" labour," and" reducing" reliance" on" costly" technology" (such" as" irrigation" " 75" "

systems"at"CGR)."Telus"did"choose"to"develop"a"budget"to"hire"a"local"urban"farmer" through"Communities"Growing"Together,"a"local"community"group,"but"this"expense" had"to"rationalized"by"the"Telus"volunteer"green"team"in"order"to"be"justified"by"the" company." The" extent" of" cost" being" an" issue" was" largely" dependent" on" the" organizational" model" of" these" projects." Being" a" community^based" Not^For^Profit" initiative," CGR" had" the" most" concern" for" costs," followed" by" the" Telus" green" roof," which" had" to" rationalize" costs," but" otherwise" was" fortunate" to" have" many" costs" absorbed"through"the"corporation"and"the"real"estate"firm"that"owned"the"building." Uniquely," TAS" owned" the" building" that" it" used" to" establish" its" project," and" so" the" costs" of" materials" were" a" small" investment," which" was" split" between" TAS" and" the" crowd"sourcing"campaign"through"the"Centre"for"Social"innovation."" " The" projects" expressed" barriers" due" to" a" lack" of" available" information" on" project" models," organizational" experiences" (e.g.:" corporate" RUA" initiatives)," projects" in" climates" similar" to" Toronto's," City" policies" and" resources," local" practitioners" and" experts,"and"funding"resources."All"three"expressed"a"need"for,"and"a"desire"to"see,"a" centralized"online"information"repository"for"RUA"knowledge"sharing,"and"each"has" chosen"to"take"steps"toward"developing"online"resources."" "" Overall,"despite"the"logistical"and"technical"experiences,"interpersonal"issues"among" volunteers"and"community"members"were"the"key"barrier"to"a"smooth"and"efficient" development"process"for"CGR."Telus'"greatest"barrier"during"establishment"was"due" to" its" corporate" structure," simply" because" as" a" company," Telus" did" not" want" to" publicize"the"project"before"it"was"fully"approved."Those"involved"with"the"project" were" cut" off" from" being" able" to" interact" with" any" local" network" players" to" gather" information"on"rooftop"agriculture."

4.3.2 Network" Practitioners" felt" that" RUA" in" Toronto" was" a" diverse" practice," but" participants" felt" that"either"there"was"not"a"network"to"speak"of,"or"at"least"not"a"cohesive"network." Participants" recognized" that" a" coordinated" RUA" network" could" potentially" affect" policy" change," making" reference" to" the" experience" of" GRHC" and" its" role" in" encouraging" the" Green" Roof" Bylaw." " The" impacts" that" this" lack" of" a" network" presented"varied"for"each"case,"as"each"project"relied"on"their"own"knowledge"base" and"contacts"to"a"different"degree."Practitioners"were"all"interested"in"playing"some" role"in"the"development"of"the"local"RUA"network,"such"as"knowledge"sharing,"but" were" concerned" about" their" capacity" to" do" so." Like" the" Key" Informant" group," Practitioners"identified"TUG"as"one"organization"under"which"RUA"could"be"housed," and" also" that" FoodShare" has" played" an" important" role" in" sharing" food" network" information."" # All" of" these" projects" involved" partnerships," linking" the" building" owners," volunteer" groups," and" other" sources" of" knowledge," experience," or" funding." Navigating" these" partnerships" was" noted" above" as" having" some" inherent" interpersonal" difficulties;" however,"all"three"projects"illustrate"how"bringing"together"varied"stakeholders"can" produce"a"functional"project,"and"reflect"values"of"inclusivity"and"collaboration." " Access"to"the"local"community"was"significantly"less"for"the"corporate"projects"than" for"the"CGR,"an"already"established"part"of"the"community"in"its"local"area."For"TAS" and"Telus,"any"community"participation"was"envisioned"as"a"desired"end"result"once" the" gardens" were" completed," rather" than" throughout" the" process," like" with" Carrot" Green"Roof."As"an"example,"CGR"sought"out"information"over"a"long"period"of"time," and"consulted"primarily"with"local"(unpaid)"experts,"individuals,"and"organizations" to" find" out" how" to" successfully" set" up" an" intensive" food^producing" roof," while" keeping" costs" low." As" a" community" effort," CGR" welcomed" food" advocacy" groups," " 77" "

universities,"community"groups,"and"individuals"to"share"and"work"the"roof"space." Obviously," having" community" as" part" of" the" garden's" mandate" meant" that" this" project"had"large"group"of"partners"and"participants." " Telus'" green" roof" was" driven" by" the" vision" of" Audrey" Bayens," who" gained" the" support"of"a"volunteer"group"(the"Telus"Green"Team),"management,"and"the"building" owner," Menkie's," in" order" to" establish" the" project." This" support" included" financial" capital"to"hire"a"local"farmer"from"Communities"Growing"Together."This"project"is"an" example" of" numerous" and" varied" partnerships" coming" together" to" enable" a" RUA" project"in"a"corporate"environment." " The"TAS"green"roof"is"an"example"of"a"simple"partnership"between"the"company"and" not^for^profit" organization," Cultivate" Toronto." Due" to" the" top^down" nature" of" this" project,"the"company"offered"the"space"to"Cultivate"TO,"with"Point"acting"as"a"liason" between"TAS"management"and"Cultivate"TO."TAS"was"in"a"position"to"help"fund"the" project," which" eliminated" cost" concerns." Once" the" project" was" set" up," Cultivate" TO" took" over" the" operations" of" the" space," while" keeping" an" open" channel" of" communication"to"Point."Being"an"architecture"firm,"TAS"had"a"fair"understanding"of" the"municipal"bylaws"in"place"and"which"city"employees"to"contact"for"information" surrounding" food" production" and" rooftops." As" a" partnership," TAS" relied" upon" the" experience" of" Cultivate" TO" as" its" primary" information" resource." Cultivate" TO" brought"their"existing"knowledge,"volunteer"capacity,"as"well"as"food"production"and" donation" model" to" TAS." Having" an" experienced" growing" partner" appears" to" be" a" benefit"when"setting"up"this"type"of"project."In"the"case"of"Telus,"there"was"an"overall" lack"of"awareness"about"how"to"present"the"project"to"management"in"a"satisfactory" way,"and"a"local"group"with"a"track"record"of"rooftop"farming"experience"may"have" been" able" to" help." Likewise," with" CGR," an" experienced" guide" with" specific" rooftop" " 78" "

gardening" experience" would" have" likely" been" helpful" in" focusing" the" effort," as" the" main" issue" appears" to" have" been" simply" having" too" many" people" involved" in" the" planning"process." " Each" project" accessed" information" within" their" networks" and" partnerships" to" varying" degrees." The" Telus" project" was" isolated" due" the" imposed" confidentiality" required" as" a" result" of" its" corporate" structure," having" only" accessed" a" single" connection" (the" project's" hired" urban" farmer" through" Communities" Growing" Together)." Both" TAS" and" CGR" were" aware" of" other" organizations" and" municipal" departments" that" are" involved" in" urban" agriculture" and" green" roofs." Carrot" Green" Roof's" community" consultation" process" included" the" TFPC" through" some" of" its" members,"and"utilized"the"city's"LiveGreen"Eco^Roof"Incentive"Program"for"funding." After"a"period"of"reduced"involvement"since"the"early"stages"of"the"CGR"project,"TUG" was" again" becoming" more" involved" with" the" rooftop." While" representatives" from" TAS"did"not"reach"out"to"GRHC,"they"were"aware"of"the"organization,"and"GRHC"has" used" the" CGR" space" for" events." " This" ongoing" association" between" GRHC" and" CGR" may"be"a"key"reason"why"many"believe"that"GRHC"is"actively"advocating"for"RUA"in" the"city"TAS"connected"with"TUG,"and"the"City"of"Toronto"through"the"TFPC"to"find" out" about" food" donation," and" the" Department" of" Planning" about" the" green" roof" bylaw."Both"TAS"and"CGR"were"connected"through"their"interactions"with"the"TFPC" and"FoodShare,"as"will"be"discussed"in"the"SNA"section"of"this"document."" " 4.3.3 Values" Within" their" respective" organizational" frameworks," these" projects" were" conceived" as" a" means" of" accomplishing" various" goals" through" utilizing" rooftop" space" and" activating" its" greater" potential." While" all" three" projects" follow" different" organizational" models," they" all" share" common" objectives" and" are" driven" by" social" " 79" "

values,"rather"than"profit^based"values."While"the"production"potential"for"all"of"the" projects" is" quite" modest," the" projects" are" involved" with" the" community" through" donating"the"food"to"local"shelters"(with"the"exception"of"Telus,"which"at"the"time"of" writing" is" determining" what" they" will" do" with" their" first" yield)." All" three" projects" identified" intangible" social" benefits" as" priorities," such" as" community" engagement," education," health" and" wellness," and" local" food" security," albeit" to" varying" degrees." However," all" interview" participants" felt" strongly" about" having" their" project" represent"an"example"of"RUA"in"order"to"showcase"the"potential"of"this"practice"and" inspire" others." By" presenting" a" range" of" garden" styles," these" projects" hope" to" illustrate"the"range"of"options"and"the"potential"for"experimentation"within"RUA." " TAS"appeared"to"be"more"focused"on"food"production"than"both"CGR"and"Telus,"and" was"identified"by"Emma"Point"as"having"a"role"in"contributing"to"greater"local"food" security." CGR" and" Telus" acknowledged" that" food" production" was" really" not" as" important"an"outcome"as"the"education"and"social"benefits"that"the"projects"would" generate."CGR"identified"community"access"and"education"as"its"main"values,"which" were"in"line"with"Telus'"rooftop"goals."Both"see"the"importance"of"using"the"garden" space"as"an"opportunity"to"educate"on"food"and"gardening"related"subjects,"and"to" have"people"feel"less"intimidated"about"growing."Fostering"a"greater"connection"to" nature" and" green" space" was" a" desired" outcome" expressed" by" both" projects." Academic"involvement"was"important"for"CGR,"having"the"University"of"Toronto"and" the"University"of"Guelph"involved"with"test"plots"was"viewed"as"a"success,"and"Telus" felt" that" having" a" university" affiliation" through" graduate^level" research" would" add" legitimacy"to"the"project."While"TAS"did"not"identify"a"specific"interest"in"academic" recognition,"Point"felt"that"media"awareness"of"the"roof,"and"the""Local"Food"Hero"" award" from" the" TFPC" (recognizing" leadership" in" the" local" food" system)" were" accomplishments"for"the"garden."For"the"TAS"rooftop,"community"engagement"was" " 80" "

not" possible" in" the" first" year," but" as" a" priority" point" for" both" Telus" and" TAS," the" issues" are" being" reviewed" and" addressed" in" an" effort" to" reduce" barriers" to" community"access."" " Each" project" felt" that" sharing" their" experiences" and" creating" publically" accessible" resources"about"the"projects"was"an"important"component"of"the"initiative."None"of" the" Practitioners" felt" that" there" was" an" existing" RUA" network" in" Toronto," and" so" documentation" and" knowledge" sharing" was" identified" as" a" valuable" step," and" an" important"responsibility"for"them"as"practitioners.""" ! 4.3.4 Legitimacy!

Preliminary"analysis"of"Toronto's"RUA"network,"as"an"extension"of"the"city's"urban" agriculture" community," indicated" that" it" was" a" small," community^driven," localized" food^producing" initiative." Based" on" the" literature" surrounding" food" networks" (as" discussed"above),"RUA"appeared"to"reflect"the"six"main"characteristics"of"a"CFN"as" put"forward"by"Renting,"Schermer,"and"Rossi"(2012),"rather"than"its"predecesor,"the" AFN." While" AFNs" have" been" linked" to" a" desire" to" challenge" or" run" counter" to" conventional" food" systems," Toronto's" RUA" community" appears" to" be" most" accurately"represented"by"the"newer"theoretical"construct"of"the"CFN,"put"forward" by"Renting" et#al"(2012)."Veen,"Derkzen,"and"Wiskerke"(2012)"note"that"many"AFNS" have"elements"of"politicalization"and"reflexivism"in"their"agendas,"although"based"on" the"interviews"conducted"for"this"research,"these"concepts"appear"to"be"absent"from" the" dialogue."

"Often! cities! are! the! starting! point! for! foodasystem! innovations! associated!with!CFNs"! Rooftop"agriculture,"as"an"innovation"particularly"suited"to"urban"environments,"due" to" the" large" and" concentrated" expanses" of" flat," unused" roof" space." Large^scale" commercial"RUA"projects,"such"as"Lufa"Farms,"the"Brooklyn"Grange,"Gotham"Greens" among" others," have" been" established" in" cities" in" recent" years" (Section" 2.1)." Increased"establishment"over"the"last"decade"implies"growth"in"the"development"of" RUA" as" an" urban" agriculture" practice." Specifically" in" Toronto," RUA" projects" have" been"gaining"in"popularity"in"recent"years,"with"some"participants"citing"the"Royal" York" Hotel's" well^publicized" rooftop" garden" (established" in" 1998)" as" a" reason" for" this." This" growing" interest" in" RUA" in" Toronto" also" points" to" an" increase" in" practitioners,"and"therefore"its"growth"as"a"network." " Rooftop" agriculture" has" proven" to" be" very" versatile" in" its" applications" (different" growing" methods," volunteer" and" donation" models," and" organization" types" developing" projects)," which" suits" the" variety" of" rooftops" in" an" urban" landscape," as" well"as"the"city"acting"as"a"hub"for"innovation"and"knowledge"transfer."The"city"is"a" place"where"many"diverse"actors"can"come"together"and"share"their"experiences"and" " 85" "

While"the"RUA"community"is"not"perceived"to"be"a"cohesive"network,"the"practice"of" rooftop" agriculture" is" increasing," and" new" relationships" are" forming" as" a" result" in" this" early" stage" of" network" development." As" Rod" MacRae" explains," food" networks" tend" to" start" out" small," and" although" the" RUA" network" is" only" just" emerging," it" is" " 86" "

civil"society"driven"and"based"on"social"values,"and"these"are"the"primary"indicators" that"RUA"is"an"emerging"CFN."" Urban" agriculture" overall" is" experiencing" a" resurgence" as" a" popular" urban" activity" (Steel,"2009),"and"so"diverse"gardening"methods"are"making"it"possible"for"people"to" connect" with" gardening" and" how" food" is" produced." RUA" as" a" form" of" urban" agriculture" is" allowing" practitioners" and" community" members" to" experience" new" methods"of"food"production"and"community"building"through"specific"RUA"projects." Illustrating" new" forms" of" food" citizenship," the" RUA" projects" studied" within" this" research" show" community" support" through" food" donation" to" vulnerable" local" populations," or" in" the" case" of" Telus," the" possibility" of" doing" this" once" the" garden" begins" producing." These" three" projects" are" driven" by" community" values" and" a" charity" model," rather" than" being" predominantly" income" driven." An" additional" element"of"these"three"project"models"was"education"and"community"engagement," showing" a" desire" to" involve" participants" in" new" interactions" with" food" and" gardening,"and"driving"a"deeper"sense"of"connection"to"food,"nature,"and"community." Although" not" a" focus" of" this" research" due" to" an" unfortunate" lack" of" response" from" restaurant^based" RUA" practitioners," it" became" apparent" that" even" smaller^scale" restaurant" initiatives" have" the" potential" to" be" a" part" of" this" emerging" network." By" connecting"consumers"with"the"food"produced"on"location,"restaurants"connect"with" the" community," raise" the" profile" and" awareness" of" local" food" production," and" they" have" the" potential" to" become" allies" and" key" players" in" the" local" rooftop" urban" agriculture"community."The"variety"of"organizational"and"project"models"(illustrated" in"Table"5)"allows"for"a"broad"reach"into"community"groups,"with"diverse"interests," and"across"many"parts"of"Toronto's"downtown"core."This"affords"RUA"the"potential" to" interact" and" engage" on" different" levels," and" to" become" an" accessible" urban" greenspace."

Through" this," academics" are" putting" a" focus" on" the" practice" and" sharing" their" findings" with" other" academics" and" relevant" city" departments."

" Toronto's"RUA"projects"themselves"are"primarily"run"by"organizations,"rather"than" private"individuals"(See"Table"5),"and"as"such"may"be"positioned"to"better"promote" public" knowledge" of" the" practice," and" increase" community" engagement." The" three" projects"which"were"analyzed"in"this"research"show"three"very"different"methods"of" integrating" partnerships," community" and" other" stakeholders," and" if" these" are" any" indication" of" the" broader" RUA" network," there" is" great" diversity" and" potential" for" unique" cooperative" ventures."

Through"identifying"Toronto's"RUA"efforts"in"terms"of"how"the"community"(however" disparate)" embodies" the" principles" of" a" civic" food" network," it" becomes" clear" that" RUA"is"driven"by"people"who"associate"the"practice"with"specific"values."Being"that" this" is" a" civic^driven" effort," a" social" network" assessment" was" used" to" better" understand"the"links"that"actors"have"with"one"another."Information"was"collected" during"the"initial"RUA"project"inventory"(See"Figure"11,"Table"5),"in"addition"to"both" interview" sets" where" participants" shared" details" of" individuals," projects" and" " 95" "
