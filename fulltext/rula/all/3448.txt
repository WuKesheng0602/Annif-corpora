ABSTRACT As an alternative approach to production and distribution practices, the facility was designed to challenge the way urban inhabitants interact with agriculture within the city landscape. The architectural component of urban agriculture is strongly lacking; various social, environmental, and economic issues prevent growing practices from scaling up within the city. The ever increasing volume of food transported into the city on a daily basis needs to be re-conceptualized and paired with an architectural approach that fosters year round growing practices. A new way of thinking about where and how to grow food, as well as an alternative to distributing food throughout the densely populated urban landscape is crucial. By introducing a highly productive growing facility into an area of the city which has high land values, placed in a central dense location without ideal conditions for growing, the design intends to present a new way of thinking about where and how to grow and move food throughout the city. The intent is to expose contemporary production practices, provide engagement with various growing techniques and make such a place accessible within a densely populated urban environment.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my family, friends and Jeremy for their endless support, patients and encouragement throughout my entire academic career. I am exI would like to thank my committee members, Vera Straka, Leila Farah and Arthur Wrigglesworth for their patients, encouragement, and foresight of my project. Thank you for always encouraging me to explore more challenging ideas, your support has added considerably to my graduate experience. I would like to dedicate this thesis to my dad, Scott Patterson, who passed away days before the project commenced. He was one of many generations of Patterson farmers from Southwestern Ontario who cultivated the lands of Cashmere. advocate the importance of the role of the farmer. He often said, "everyone will always need to eat, therefore, there will always be farmers". I would also like to dedicate this thesis to my mom, Lenore Patterson and eldest sister, Krista Patterson, who have taken over my dad's role on the farm and continue to cultivate the land my he maintained for the majority of his life. I am proud beyond measure.

INTRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE + AGRICULTURE + URBAN INHABITANTS

1.0

This thesis focuses on using architecture as a vehicle to alter the current relationships urban inhabitants have with agriculture. ry city landscape has removed nearly all visible food production processes (planting, harvesting, preparation, distribution), resulting in an absence of knowledge and awareness for the amount of energy and effort required to get food from a place of production to consumption. The energy demands of the production of food are rendered nearly invisible to the average consumer. The transportation and distribution which occurs prior to produce arrival in markets is immense, with emissions and fossil fuel depletion occurring at every stage of a plant's development. and easy access to agricultural production practices span far beyond the environmental discourse of the city. There is an abundance of "soand food security and encompass youth economic development and education" (Veenhuizen, 2007). The social, economic, and environmental discourses of the city all have the potential to strengthen with wide spread implementation of urban agricultural practices. All stages of the agricultural production process must emerge within the city landscape, as "food production, processing and consumption together constitute perhaps the most basic aspect of resilience for human communities" (Veenhuizen, 2007).

In order to answer the questions: how can architecture alter urban attempt to understand the discourse of food in the contemporary city. The lack of agricultural practices and apparent processes of food production within cities has caused negatives affects on the body, earth and planetary survival. The disconnect between places of production and consumption can be seen as one of the major issues of

prevent/challenge the inception of urban agricultural practices into the current built fabric of the city; therefore, it is essential to consider alternative approaches to growing food within the city. Current partnering of agriculture and architecture within the city of Toronto require reconceptualizing; the hope is that the current paradigm towards food in the architectural discourse will improve. By analyzing food's relationship with various discourses central to a modern, urban city within the western world, strategies and tactics sign response. Understanding the relationships between food and the social, environmental, economic discourses of the city will aid in altering the current relationship urban inhabitants have with agriculture.

FOOD AND URBAN INHABITANTS

1.1

"As animals of nature and creatures of social comfort, our life in cities ing together on the land can offer. Away from the very nature that we seem only to tend to survival in the city" (Leung, 2013). Basic survival is dependent on the provisions of shelter, food and clothing; yet, the modern, western world has produced cities which are highly segregated from places of production of such primitive needs. With technological advancements priorities have shifted from merely times the "homo urbanus has ... delegated his quality of life to technology and consumerism, degrading the once more prominent role greater prominence and should be placed more centrally within the discourse of the modern city. Considering, "there is nothing in human life and culture that is not touched in someway by food" (McAdam, 2012), it is evident that there is reason for concern. The current urban condition has resulted from man's desire to `satisfy his comfort'. As a result, "cities actively harm the physical environment and thereby make the entire region less able to sustain life" (Blassingame, 1998). Outsourcing is common practice and urban inhabitants have become highly unaware of the origin of most food they consume, clothes they wear, or materials within which they reside. Nowadays, it is far easier for mankind to purchase necessities, than to attempt to produce them. The entire concept of `basic human needs' has become highly distorted and subject to global location. The technological dependency of the western world has made it nearly impossible As society evolves, there must be some notion of returning focus to the natural environment.

Introducing natural systems into the urban environment contributes to improving urbanite's overall quality of life. All aspects of life are imof air and water, and limits noise pollution" (Gil, 2013). In addition to environmental improvements, the inception of nature into the city "encourages social interaction among neighbors, and can increase both physical and mental health, enriching urban life with emotions and meaning" (Gil, 2013). Growing food in the city must demand greater attention, as such practices satisfy requirements of sustaining life on the planet. Everyone is subject to basic human needs, and it is an unfortunate reality that urban inhabitants are becoming increasingly disconnected from the process associated with getting food from a place of production to consumption. By introducing food production to the urban public realm and interior architectural spaces, great improvements and transformations will occur. The various processes of food production are noted for being "a key dimension in place-making, the strengthening of bonds between residents and the landscape that sustain them" (Veenhuizen, 2007). Its much more than just fuel for the body, it can be fuel for the community, used to strengthen relationship between members, as well as urban inhabitants connection to the environment.

FOOD AND THE CITY
CONCENTRATED DEVELOPMENT AND FOOD CONSUMPTION

plosion in numbers of the human species" (Blassingame, 1998). The population growth demands an unprecedented volume of resources has been centered around urban areas and this shift from the rural to urban landscape has generated new conditions of concern for the 21st century. More people are living closer together, within cities; yet, the resources being consumed are traveling ever increasing distances to get from a place of production to consumption. Food production and consumption have become two, isolated functions occurring at monumental distances apart from one another.This has given rise to the issue that the contemporary urban landscape is changing and requires additional functions to occur within the conof larger developed metropolises that link is invisible.The energy-hungry infrastructure associated with remote food production, transport and display is equally invisible" (Viljoen, Bohn, 2008). Out of sight, out of mind is no longer an acceptable state of being. The local situation is such that "nearly 90% of Canada's population growth is concentrated in large metropolitan areas" (MacRae, 2010). With an ever increasing trend of population growth within and surrounding cities, it is evident that current practices regarding where food is produced, how it is distributed and where it is consumed will have to change. It is unfortunate that "so many aspects of our everyday lives are dependent on nature, yet remain removed from it ... nature can nurture in ways that space cannot" (Leung, 2013).The benpotential. Lackluster green space in the city and the whole notion of natural systems and agriculture in the city requires re-visioning as we enter the 21st century. Many forces are acting against implementation of agricultural practices within the city; however, by resisting such adoption cities become vulnerable to such future concerns as fuel price increases and volatility, threats of food supply and health concerns of industrialized farm practices.

FOOD AND THE BUILT FABRIC
B ARRIERS OF IMPLEMENTATION

Food has played a large role in shaping the current city; however, "here lives for an old world concept like [agriculture] - particularly one that requires constant care and attention in a lifestyle that is riddled with distractions and competing interests" (McAdam, 2012). Agriculture tants, as well as within the physical space of the city. Many barriers can ture activities within the city of Toronto. Table 1.0 has a compiled list issues urban growers must face when implementing new urban agricultural initiatives, both on rooftops and the ground. A number of categories have been generated which encapsulate all of the issues to be considered when implementing urban agricultural growing practices. The challenges cover issues in the realms of structural, functional and aesthetic, all issues within the capacity of the architectural discourse. In moving forward, it is critical to determine if traditional means of agriculture are desired. Considering what approach will yield most success, productive places enclosed within architectural spaces appear to eliminate a number of barriers. Having to mitigate all approach to scaling up should look "to reshape what and how food cantly old practice, and given the capabilities of current technology, there is much potential for such to be adopted into the agricultural discourse and urban landscape.

FOOD AND EXPOSURE
CURRENT PARADIGM TOWARDS FOOD IN URB AN ARCHITECTURE

Food has a dominant presence in the architectural discourse. Nearly all typologies are designed with spaces which will foster food preparation tasks, as well as spaces for consumption. Places such as kitchen/ dining areas, restaurants, grocery stores and the Ontario Food Terminal all have taken a similar approach regarding how the object of food but today, for most citizens of larger developed metropolises that link is invisible" (Viljoen, Bohn, 2008). This invisibility is the result of a front of house / back of house approach which essentially conceals the processes of food's transformation from the public. Mainly for sanitary reasons, restaurants and grocery stores employ a system where produce is delivered and contained until requested or needed. The Ontario food terminal employs a completely different tactic, although yielding similar results, completely prohibits people from entering the property. Millions of pounds of food pass through this space each day and the public, even if desired, are not able enter this place. Such actions completely support the idea that our food processes are completely removed from the public eye. It is crucial for the public to become aware of all processes required to get food to a proper state for consumption. Figure 03 highlights how urban inhabitants current relationship with agricultural practices are focused on traveling to / from the market and personal storage, and are oblivious to earlier stages of food production.

RESPONDING TO FOOD + URBAN INHABITANTS
THROUGH DESIGN

The connection between urban inhabitants and food requires consideration if an architectural response is to be proposed which will alter their current relationship with agriculture. `Urban inhabitants' is the community member - inhabitants residing in the community directly surrounding the site the transit rider - inhabitants riding on the Yonge Subway line and the urbanites in transition - inhabitants traveling through and/or by the site place of agricultural production. The intent is that urban inhabitants ious processes of agricultural production. In doing so, users of the space would return focus to the natural environment, within a densely populated urban location. They would become part of the force altering how food is grown, moved and consumed within the city and would have greater awareness of the energy and effort required to get food from a state of production to consumption. With awareness of the impact their food choices make, the hope is that more sustainable measures will be taken regarding food selection.

ENVIRONMENTAL DISCOURSE

1.2

By analyzing the environmental discourses of the modern and urban city, a greater awareness can be developed as to why urban inhabitants relationship with agriculture has evolved into a state of disconnect. The lack of natural systems within the urban environment has caused a physical separation between agriculture and urban inhabitants. Food the distribution portion of the production process has become pivotal. The impact of this stage of transportation is detrimental to the environment. The current model of importing millions of pounds of an alternate approach to the current model of food production and distribution is vital to ensuring high quality of life for urban inhabitants. "Since food and farming account for at least 30% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, the high dependence on fossil fuels needs to be reduced. People need to connect again to the understanding of growing, preparing and cooking food, so that their fragility towards the dependency on the food system can be reduced" (Veenhuizen 2007)

13

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
OF FOOD DISTRIBUTION

Food not only impacts the body, it also effects the state of the environment. Urban inhabitants must have a greater awareness of the fact that "25% of U.S. food transport greenhouse gas emissions are associated with delivery of food to consumers, and the situation may be more acute in Canada" (Nasr, MacRae, Kuhns, 2010). We have developed a highly unsustainable food production system which greatly contributes to environmental degradation and "the earth's weakening capacity to absorb greenhouse gases" (Assadourian, 2013). It is bein the coming years; most evident being, where food is to be grown. Innovative approaches to sustainable food distribution within cities is utilizing public transportation, would considerably lessen the impact of current food importing practices. Introducing places of agricultural production in central locations, where locally grown food can be easily accessible and transported, would greatly alter the current approach of food distribution. Canada has the capacity to produce an abundance of food within importing on the rise? Our food system is contributing to increasing world average for the number of global hectares (Gha) demanded / person, and within that "about 25% of U.S. food transport greenhouse gas emissions are associated with the delivery of food to consumers, and the situation may be more acute in Canada" (Nasr, 2010). This all contributes to the argument that our food system needs to shift from one of remote sourcing to local production.

OVERINDULGING
ON THE ENVIRONMENT'S RESOURCES

Global trading practices have enabled nations to "demand more bio-capacity than they have available within their own borders. This means they are liquidating their national ecological wealth, relying through trade on the bio-capacity of others" (Moore, Rees, 2013). the basis of a fair earth share. Canada, ranked 4th as having the greatest number of global hectares available / person, has created highly unsustainable importing practices. ing about 4500 km .... much of it by truck" (MacRae, 2010) (refer to of food is immense. When considering all of the energy required "for growing, watering, processing and transporting food, producing 1 cal of food cost us anywhere from a 7:1 - 10:1 ratio in energy consumed" (McAdam, 2012). Light must be shed on the severity of the problem, on borrowed time in the world fueled by cheap oil and diminishing supplies of clean water and arable land" (McAdam, 2012). The brief period between the years of 2005-2008 "has reinforced how the dominant 20th century productionist paradigm is running out of steam"(Lang, 2010); during this time that food prices steadily increased until rocketing in 2007. The relationship between people, agriculture and the planet has been entirely restructured, which can be seen through food importing practices. A shift has taken place from the local / national to continental / international. Seasonality is no longer a concept of concern as food can be imported from anywhere at any point throughout the year. The elimination of seasonality is a huge through current practices.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPIRATION
OF INFINITE RESOURCES

It is believed that the coming years will be accompanied by fundamental issues of concern which will have great affect over the 21st century food system, such being climate change, water, biodiversity, energy / fossil fuels, population growth, wastes, land, soil, labor and dietary changes (Lang, 2010), which will all contribute to inhibiting the amount of food which will be available. These issue almost certainly cannot be addressed individually; they must be considered and handled in a collective and comprehensive manner in order to yield successful results. Action must be taken relatively soon, as "no more than one or a very few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished" (Blassingame, 1998). It is unfortunate that economics, politics and power have all lead humanity to a highly unsustainable state of being. Yet it is individual choice which will determine how everyone will advance and overcome the destructive path we have been lead down. As a collective, we must make better choices because "the trajectory of city growth is downward and destructive - towards greater sprawl, sharper divisions between social groups, increased environmental damage, and further resource depletion" (Blassingame, 1998). Food production is connected to so many aspects of life and by pursuing / supporting urban agricultural practices, positive change will occur.

ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT
THROUGH ARCHITECTURE

There is very little "surprise that architectural discourse has taken a biological turn in recent years, the over-determined result of its own culpability in the degradation of the planetary environment" (Sorkin, 2013). Professionals are recognizing the need for alternative practices, as current approaches which address issues of food security have been disappointing. Sustainable design can be seen as an approach respond to earth, giving way to mechanical sustainability devoid of human engagement" (Titman, 2013). Lack of engagement is a large issue which requires redesign. Urban inhabitants are becoming increasingly removed and disconnected from natural systems and agricultural practices, which translates into a lack of concern of the amount of energy and effort required for growing food. The 21st century is "an era of elevated environmental consciousness, [just as] no building can escape the consequences of its use of energy and materials, or of the wastes it produces" (Sorkin, 2013), no consumer should be able to escape the increasing amount of energy demanded to produce food through current practices.

As a whole, Toronto needs to develop a strategy where multiple places to grow strategies are essential as current seasonality limits growing potential to a fraction of the year. In order to develop system which can sustain throughout all seasons, architectural solutions are required.

NEIGHBOURHOOD APPROACH Through analyzing neighborhood initiatives, it is evident that not all areas regard and value urban agriculture equally. It is crucial for every neighborhood to have an appreciation for locally grown food. Alternate initiatives must be conceived which will appeal to all demographics throughout the city, enticing more than just low income, priority neighborhoods. By introducing contemporary agricultural practices, which use a high-tech approach to cultivation, the hope is that typical connotations associated with traditional agricultural approaches will be altered.

BUILDING APPROACH be introduced into various buildings throughout the urban landscape. Buildings designed to publicize innovative approaches to producing food within the urban environment allow residents to interact with and become better educated about agriculture and food processes. Demonstration areas are important, as they will allow for small scale interaction between alternative growing systems and urban inhabitants. The architecture of an agricultural typology should aim to foster social connectivity, agricultural productivity, and easy accessibility.

21

In responding to issues of the environmental discourse, it is evident that a place designed for agricultural production must truly become immersed within the various layers of the city, especially the layer of transit. To alter the current model of urban agriculture, easily accessible places of food production must be introduced throughout the city landscape. With current practices, it is impossible to select a site in an urban environment with desirable growing conditions, attached to the transit system and allocate to agricultural practices. Conditions for growing are mainly consistent throughout the city, as a lack of soil, space and light are prevalent throughout the dense, urban landscape. Therefore, spaces within the city which do not have environments that will foster agricultural production using traditional practices require alternative growing techniques. Locations in the city without an abundance of space, soil or light can be adapted to become productive landscapes. Interior growing practices, using hydroponic means of production will provide year round production capabilities while evading the environmental limitations of a Canadian climate. Challenging the issue of distribution will have a great impact on the environmental discourse of the city. If agricultural production was implemented on a wide scale basis, less transportation would be required to deliver food to the city. Although local food production would result in a reduction of emissions, more energy will be required to create year round, idyllic growing conditions. and functionality is desired. The intent is to showcase the beauty and process while producing desired volumes of crops.

22

SOCIAL DISCOURSE

1.3

Through investigating the social discourses of the modern, urban city a better understanding can be developed as to why urban inhabitants relationship with agriculture has evolved to it's current state. As well, a greater understanding will aid in generating an approach where urban inhabitant's relationship with agriculture can be altered through the apparatus of architecture. The lack of presence of agriculture and natural systems within the city has yielded places which are socially disconnected, increasing urban inhabitant's retreat indoors. As well the heightened demand for convenience aids in minimizing the urban population's desire to grow their own food. In trying to strengthen and re-conceive urban inhabitants relationship with agriculture it's necessary to bring urban agricultural practices into the 21st century. The following will identify how urban inhabitants are lacking: places which foster social connection, the desire/time/effort to grow a portion of their own diet and the social skills to reconnect community members. Food and agricultural practices provide an answer to all of these scenarios. The current partnership of agriculture and architecture within the city of Toronto require reconceptualizing; the hope is that the current paradigm towards food in the architectural discourse will improve a satisfy society's current demands. "UA also strongly supports social (human) resilience ... farms can become places of adaptive learning and civic engagement, as people of different ages, ethnicities, races and income levels come together to grow food, learn new gardening skills, encounter new foods or engage and the gardeners" (Veenhuizen 2007).

23

LACK OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
PRODUCT OF HIGH DENSITY LIVING

"Can the socially vitalizing role of nature be brought back to our urban lives to re-nurture a sense of our human instinct and bring us closer to the otherwise ignored `other' - neighbor, animal, plant or stranger" (Leung, 2013). The concept of community within the urban landscape has been altered as "we now spend much of our free time indoors - clear evidence of the retreat into the private realm we pursue. This migration indoors is a new trend, alienating us from nature and from other pendency" (Gil, 2013). As we become increasingly separated from the natural environment, our connection with other urban inhabitants follows in a similar fashion. It is essential for places to be designed in the modern, urban landscape which fuse people and nature back together. By using the function of growing food, people are able to converge on common, public ground to discuss issues which everyone can relate to, no matter what ethnicity, age or gender. Food is essential in every being's life and can already be credited with bringing people together for the purposes of consumption. However, the city lacks places which unite inhabitants to focus on the processes associated with growing food. Priority neighborhoods have proven that "the presence of nature in a city ... encourages social integration among neighbors" (Gil, 2013); yet, the lifestyles condo inhabitants have come to fashion do not often incorporate agricultural practices. Urban agriculture is a missing ingredient in the modern city, amongst the concrete / glass / steel, living systems must emerge.

SUBMERGED IN THE VIRTUAL
DISCONNECTED

In the western world, it is evident that an increased dependence on technological devices has emerged within the 21st century. As a result it is "reducing our capacity to interact with physical spaces or objects ... putting the landscape back into architecture in a pastoral way would allow us to do this" (Titman, 2013). Nature and agricultural practices passively stimulate the senses greater than that of any device.

24

LACK OF TIME / DESIRE
TO GROW

urban lives for an old world concept like this [agriculture] - particularly one that requires constant care and attention in a lifestyle that is riddled with distractions and competing interests" (McAdam, 2012) Toronto is a city that is constantly on the move. It is understandable that people are under the assumption that urban agriculture required a considerable amount of time and effort invested to yield desirable in place will not sustain. Alternative methods of food production are required in order to ensure people can continue to eat nutritious food products. The reality is that "climate created shortages, coupled with escalating populations, means that food will become less available even to the well off. We would all be wise to learn some food-growing skills to pad our menus" (McAdam, 2012). Somewhere in the not-so-distant future, growing food for personal consumption will become common practice. Everyone will have to make time, as "necessity (through hunger) is a powerful motivator, but food takes time to grow, and more important so do the food networks we may urgently need long before all of us are ready"(McAdam, 2012). The lack of desire to grow food for personal consumption is evident in the placement of Toronto's urban agricultural initiatives. Commulow income and priority neighborhoods. The layout of these gardens supports the notion that people who have the money to buy food are less likely to participate in community garden initiatives. Through supporting urban agriculture, urban inhabitants are committing to improving environmental degradation. A paradigm shift is crucial as "this is a global, no-end-in-sight Victory Garden project that needs a global, community and individual commitment to protect and nurture our agriculture land, and to produce food in every precious spaces we have" (McAdam, 2012). No one should consider themselves able to escape the act of growing food for personal consumption. No matter what social class, everyone will be affected when the current food distribution system is interrupted. It is an unfortunate reality that "the lack of value, monetary and cultural assigned to the job of growing food they keeps people off the farms" (McAdam, 2012). Farmers are responsible for feeding cities and providing people with a portion of their basic human needs; yet, the profession continues to be regarded as a poor man's practice.

25

RESPONDING TO THE SOCIAL DISCOURSE
THROUGH DESIGN

There are two aspects of the social discourse which are intended to be addressed architecturally. First, the disconnect amongst urban inhabitants will be directly addressed through site design, program and circulation. Developing a place where the production of food is the focal point, allows people of every race, religion, gender and age to converge over a universal topic. Providing spaces which will foster connections amongst all types of urban inhabitants, community members, transit riders and urbanites throughout the modern, urban landscape. Second, the issues urban inhabitants have with lack of time, space or resources to grow will be accommodated through the design of formal and informal growing spaces throughout the site; providing an opportunity for people to participate in short or long term involvement with agricultural practices.The intent is to provide the opportunity for people to engage with different stages of agricultural process through and engagement to urban inhabitants, and placing the site in a central, posed to and aware of issues surrounding food production.

26

ECONOMIC DISCOURSE

1.4

Understanding the economic discourse of the city provides a much clearer reasoning as to why urban inhabitants relationship with agriculture has evolved to it's current state. Recognizing the powerful indominantly within low income / priority neighborhoods. A large part of this has to do with the term value. Value, as the importance or usefulness of something, is not held in high regard when considering urban agriculture. Despite repeated Toronto, the government has responded only modestly. Urban agriculon a small scale, independent basis. The presence of urban agriculture initiatives, can be credited to institutions and community organizations. Public initiatives in central, desirable location are essential for altering the current relationship urban inhabitants have with agricultural practices. Such initiatives are in constant competition with economic endeavors, e.g. commercial and residential development, which yields

basis.

LOW INCOME / PRIORITY NEIGHBOURHOOD
CONCENTRATION OF URB AN AGRICULTURE INITIATIVES

The lack of centrally located urban agriculture initiatives often renders them invisible to the city as a whole. Placement of successful urban agricultural initiatives remains immersed throughout the city on a small scale, independent basis. What is required to evoke change is central presence amongst all of the discourses of the city, social / economic / environmental, as well as being easily accessible by transit. In order for urban growers to obtain land they have to look beyond conspicuous sites, often selecting left over, oddly shaped parcels of land in order to make their operation feasible. Urban agriculture has a stigma attached to it, which renders it "an economically `weaker' form of land use in urban development" (Veenhuizen 2007). In order to create change urban agriculture must acquire land where there are "a large number of urban stakeholders with competing interests ... and their views on local development differ widely" (Veenhuizen 2007). Implementing than that of traditional practices; yet, the need and potential for innovation is greater. This is the result of there being "a higher intensity of technical innovation, more diversity in farming types as well as new forms of organization and cooperation" (Veenhuizen 2007). The economic discourse presents a huge challenge for agricultural practices to face, as they look to break into the market. However, urban places of agricultural production will present "innovation through huizen 2007). It is understood that a business strategy is necessary for comprehending the feasibility of this type of project in an urban setting. Therefore, a model focusing on "civic agriculture [which] comprises various forms of direct marketing, such as markets, community supported agriculture, or cooperative production and distribution, all of which closely connect food producers and consumers" (Veenhuizen 2007) will all be incorporated to ensure the practicality of the proposal.

RESPONDING TO THE ECONOMIC DISCOURSE
THROUGH DESIGN

The economic discourse could be the largest barrier agricultural proHigh price of land, competing interests, `value' of land uses, are all issues raised when looking to incorporate agriculture into urban areas. Therefore, an architectural response which will adequately challenge be required in order to justify centrally locating an urban agricultural facility on high priced land. The design response will also contain a business model, outlining how the facility is to operate (food production, preparation, distribution and marketing), critical to determining the potential of the proposal.

In addition to recognizing the problems of which "could become an important component of urban development" (Our Common Future, 1987). Nearly thirty years later, it is questionable whether alternative agricultural practices have become mainstream, or if they remain as notable initiatives.

AGRICULTURAL EVOLUTION

of agriculture has evolved. Agriculture, was once a practice heavily anchored to socio-cultural factors of place; however, today in the western world it is common for people to be completely oblivious to the effort, energy and resources required to grow and distribute food for consumption. It is evident that today, agriculture has "rapidly developed, along with the processing of food, to become commoditized, industrialized and globalized within the last 50 years" (Maynard, Nault, 2005). The socio-cultural element is nearly invisible regarding the practices of cultivating food; yet it has been successfully retained in the act of consumption. Food as a means to represent people, places or traditions and to generate social gatherings has transformed. The work required prior to meal preparation is rendered nearly invisible in the modern, developed world. The constant demand for more er yields from farmers. Fortunately, increased production has been possible as a result of technological advancements. The "introduction of the combustion engine and electricity for power, the advent of synthetic fertilizers and crop protection materials, and the non-stop arpractices of the traditional acts of husbandry. Although improvements have been made, in order to keep pace with the increasing population, while employing sustainable practices may be the greatest challenge facing the agricultural production.

33

TRADITIONAL - MODERN
AG R I C U LT U R A L P R AC T I C E S

Traditional agricultural methods of production have substantially progressed from their original practices some 10,000 years ago. With the steadily increasing global population the demand for food has equally passed down over centuries farmers have been able to dramatically increase their yields and meet the demands. As we embark upon the 21st century, the social, economic and environmental conditions of the globe are changing and alternative practices must be conceived. In order to increase yields and meet the global food supply demands "farmers in urban settings are also involved in looking for new and creative ways to improve their farming and other productive activities, perhaps even more so than their rural counterparts on account of ing into the city realm introduces a number of variables rural farmers are typically able to avoid. Innovative solutions are required as there is limited space for production, high competition for desirable land, lack of available resources, high volumes of inhabitants often unaware or uninterested in growing practices. Agriculture, as a function of architecture will have an increased occurrence in the 21st century urban landscape. It is inevitable that food production and consumption will Fossil fuel depletion will eventually bring a halt to the global trading practices that are in place. Essentially, "strategies need to be developed that focus on merging man made urbanization with nature" (Gil, 2013) as architecture has become highly removed from elements of the organic within the modern city.

34

AGRICULTURAL ARCHITECTURE
CURRENT PRACTICES

Architecture of the modern urban landscape support an ambiguity of food's origin, energy and effort required to get food from a place of production to consumption. It is "acceptable for families to buy 100% of their food from supermarkets for their entire lives. We have no control over this food: we select from what has been chosen for us and we do so without knowing where the food is coming from, how long it has traveled, who has grown and handled it on our behalf and what risks are entitled and eating it" (McAdam, 2012). We are oblivious to the fuel we are putting into our bodies, entertaining idyllic scenarios of places of origin of such food. It is unfortunate; however, "we've been trained not to know where our food comes from" (McAdam, 2012). Every urban place of food: grocery stores, restaurants and food terminals, all encourage a front of house / back of house scenario. es which are associated with getting food to an acceptable state for consumption. It is essential to once again pair practices of agriculture with architecture, as "urban agriculture can build community, green our urban spaces and improve food distribution in our cities" (McAdpresence within the city. Architecture can be used to "alleviate the mundaneness of urban life through the introduction of the absurdity of nature, which brings `joy and laughter to the stressed worker" (Cannon, Gianvanni, 2013). Yet, the value attached to natural landscapes is immeasurable, and always falls short when pinned against the quanti-

a certain degree of anarchy to stimulate him. How to combine the need of control with the desire of rebellion? Can the combination of city and wilderness bring together the rational and the unpredictable for the stimulation of people? The old idea of splitting rural and urban ecologies is not attractive in either environmental or social terms" (Gil, 2013). The conceptual division of rural and urban landscapes has generate two distinctive approaches to designing with agriculture.The elements often associated within a rural landscape are: low-tech, romantic, body, landscape, poetic and spiritual; whereas, the urban is often associated with the elements of high-tech, rational, machine, building, practical and material. Bridging of this divide is required as all of the elements have the potential to be incorporated in a forward thinking vessel which supports the functions of agricultural practices within a densely populated urban landscape. In creating a sustainable future where mental element of the approach should be "building differently-more in harmony with nature and the inclusion of the natural within the man made" (Blassingame, 1998). This approach should not be considand generate the interest of urban inhabitants.

EAST VS. WEST MENTALITY
CURRENT PRACTICES

It is important to consider the approach taken by the eastern world, regard the inception of natural systems. "The west perceives nature as a force to be overcome, to be controlled. The East precedes nature as a partner to be respected, to be accommodated" (Rudd, 2002). By accepting such an alternative approach to design, the outcome systems, and the architecture can be contained as a companion to such a system.

AGRICULTURAL CHALLENGES The question surrounding agriculture is how to continue to increase yields on a planet which is subject to constant land degradation from an ever increasing population. In an attempt to satisfy environmental conservation, the food system's approach to distribution must be imity to one another in order to ensure a long term solution to food security. Given the fact that "by 2025 two thirds of humanity will live in cities" (MacRae, 2010), it is essential to design places of production within urban areas. By supplementing the volume of food imported globally, great environmental improvements will be seen. Less transportation directly translates into reduced production of carbon emissions. Alternative approaches to the traditionally land intensive, horizontal

URBAN AGRICULTURE'S IMPORTANCE As much as current agricultural practices would like to disregard the "combines effects of climate change, peak oil, the recent food crisis, rapid urbanization, and continued population growth" (Veenhuizen,2007) the reality is that these factors "have the potential to undermine the resilience of our cities and ultimately render the current food system unsustainable" (Veenhuizen,2007). Introducing growing practices into the urban landscape is important because "cities are the magnets of consumption and their `food-print' accounts for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions" (Veenhuizen,2007). The environmental improvements which accompany the inception of urban agricultural practices requires greater consideration, as implementation would have the potential to also improve aspects of the city's social and landscape supports social vibrancy, as such places can support "adaptive learning and civic engagement, as people of different ages, ethnicities, races and income levels come together to grow food, learn new gardening skills, encounter new foods or engage in problem-solving (Veenhuizen,2007). The monetary value associated with this type of pared to a leased space, urban agriculture generates less income on a sq.ft. basis; yet, the term value requires reconsideration as the contributions to the local economy, carbon sequestration and civic engagement all add to the city's merit and should be focused on, rather than

AGRICULTURAL CONSIDERATION
AS A FUNCTION OF THE URB AN LANDSC APE

Urban agriculture, typically understood as the simplistic act of growing food in the city. However, the application of farming in an urban setting impacts a wide range of discourses and networks. The connotations typically associated with urban agriculture need to be re-conceived as "the most important distinguishing character of urban agriculture is not so much its location ... but the fact that it is an integral part of the urban economic, social and ecological system"(Veenhuizen,2007). Numerous aspect of a community are transformed with the inception of urban agriculture resulting in both positive and negative impacts. Negative, often associated with human health risks, which can result from: "- contamination of crops ... as a result of irrigation with wastewater or unhygienic handling of the products during transport, processing and marketing of fresh products, - spread of certain human diseases by mosquitoes and scavenging animals attracted by agricultural activities - contamination of crops due to prolonged intensive use of agrochemicals - contamination of soils and products with heavy metals due

and chemicals, and urban growing should not be discarded due to the aforementioned. An abundance of positive features result from the adoption of urban agriculture into city landscapes. Numerous positive sustainable development includes "local economic development and food supply as well as recycling of wastes, urban greening, maintaining open green buffer zones, provisions of recreational services, social inclusion of disadvantaged groups etc." (Veenhuizen,2007).

URBAN AGRICULTURE As long term, sustainability is continually challenged by rising prices of food and fuel, climate change, and water scarcity (Veenhuizen,2007), the 21st century city must look towards resiliency to ensure preservation of the environment. With the ever increasing urban concentration of residents cities are entering focus as they are "the magnets of consumption and their `food-print' accounts for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions" (Veenhuizen,2007). Although the approach of growing food in the city is seemingly ideal, there are many challenges faced as it demands a completely different approach to traditional agricultural methods. The physical separation between places of food production and consumed is at an unprecedented high. Agriculture is no longer central to the layout of the city, but occurs thousands of miles from the places which it is consumed. Given the context of Toronto, "the average imported food is traveling about 4500 km, much of it by truck". Conas the volume of food consumed on a daily basis it is evident that re-evaluation is required regarding how people produce, transport, store and consume food, "for growing, watering, processing and transporting food, producing 1 cal of food cost us anywhere from a 7:1 - a 10:1 ratio in energy consumed" (McAdam, 2012). Given a 2000 calorie diet x 7 billion world population, current methods cannot sustain the growing population. Collaboration between the architectural and agricultural discourses is essential. Successful integration which will result in a "sustainable urban production systems, [requires] inentation" (Veenhuizen,2007). The design of architectural places which will improve the current production, retail and distribution processes is essential to ensure the city's transformation towards resiliency. Agriculture is undoubtedly an architectural issue that will become ever more apparent as time progresses.

72

Architects are valuable, as they are able to coordinate, manage and conceive solutions; yet, architectural solutions to agricultural problems have yet to fully integrate within the city landscape. As seen in Toronpotential has yet to occur. Current popular solutions for introducing urban agriculture has been the addition of growing plots onto the existing built fabric, e.g. rooftop gardens; however, not all architects advocate for green roof construction. This addition has an abundance of built fabric.The architectural discourse should have a greater presence of agriculture to the city landscape; yet, within the city of Toronto currently initiatives remain in the hands of academics, community members and food policy council members.

TORONTO'S DENSITY
CHALLENGING THE INTRODUCTION OF UA

The challenge of introducing agricultural practices back into the landscape of the urban city requires adaptation of the man made environment. Adding agricultural functions to such a dense and developed city as Toronto requires innovation. There is a lack of agriculture production occurring within and directly surrounding the city of Toronto, due to the constant outward sprawl overtaking farmland; therefore, supporting the unsustainable importing practices. Innovative approaches to food production are crucial as farmers and growers must continue to increase yields on a planet which is subject to constant land degradation from an ever increasing population. Alternative approaches to the traditionally land intensive, horizontal practice of agriculture must be explored.

CURRENT PRACTICES REVIEWING TORONTO'S URBAN AGRICULTURE INITIATIVES Black Creek Community Farm This urban agriculture initiative has the objectives of acting as a social justice leader, aspiring to provide a leadership model for surrounding communities. Black creek enables economic opportunities through hands on training and intergenerational learning experiences. Downsview Park The food program employed at Downsview Park attempts to be a thought and market leader in empowering all to make conscious food choices. The objectives of this program is to re-connect people with agricultural practices, by making it a common element in the urban environment. Foodshare Foodshare is a program that partners with community leaders, school programs and organizations within the city of Toronto to promote knowledge and access to healthy food produced in a sustainable manner. Their focus is working with under served communities and providing tools and expertise to build a `just food system'. Wychwood Barns / The Stop In addition to being a cultural hub of activity, Wychwood Barns and The Stop provide urban agricultural practices to enhance food security. The objective of the stop is to increase access to healthy food in a manner that maintains dignity, while building healthy communities.

LACKING INTEGRATION AGRICULTURE + ARCHITECTURE "The review examples can establish the patterns, the tendencies, that

The architectural component of the agricultural initiatives is strongly lacking; yet, what these spaces provide are exemplary programs and functions occurring within such spaces. The variety of initiatives is notable, as there is no identical duplication between places. Each employ their own unique approach to bringing urban agriculture to the city environment. This is interesting to note, mainly because there is little duplications within the same fabric; therefore, identifying that every application requires unique consideration. No single formula should be generated, as places which support agriculture should be as unique to consider the project as being a `prototype' which can be introduced into any context, regardless of the social, economic or environmnetal conditions. In order to be successful, a productive growing facility must look to its context to inform scale of production, social programs, site design, and so forth. The programs, which are all centered around growing practices can be categorized and noted for contributing to social, economic and environmental discourses. Their programmatic approaches are incorpoproduction for the design response. The intent is to create a agricultural production facility which will have greater integration between agriculture and architecture. A balance between strong program and architecture is necessary to progress agriculture's presence within the modern, urban city.

EXPANDING AGRICULTURE'S PRESENCE WITHIN THE CITY OF TORONTO exemplary agricultural practices within the city of Toronto. Located sities these programs are being deployed in summer months and are thriving. Although noteworthy, the initiatives remain centered around Toronto's priority and low income neighborhoods. Expansion beyond leftover, oddly shaped parcels of land in undesirable areas of the city would ensure greater exposure to the general public. Addressing accessibility, and situating urban agricultural production processes within high density areas of the city, and along transit lines will generate desired results. In order to alter the current relationship urban inhabitants have with agriculture, moves must be made which will re-conceive how and where agriculture is to be produced within the city.

ENGAGING WITH TORONTO'S DISCOURSES
SOCIAL / ECONOMIC / ENVIRONMENTAL

Engaging with Toronto's social, economic and environmental discourses and implementing a place of agricultural production within the city landscape requires innovation. If an architectural response is to alter the current relationship urban inhabitants have with agriculture it must diverge from traditional practices. As discussed in part one, there are a wide variety of issues preventing the implementation of an agricultural production facility in a central location within the dense urban landscape. Strategies responding to the discourses, which are to be embedded within the project are found on page 92 (design principles). Responses, which have informed the strategies are as follows:

RESPONDING TO THE SOCIAL DISCOURSE
THROUGH DESIGN

amongst urban inhabitants, and the lack of time, desire, or resources The strategies implemented to address such issues include articulation of program, circulation and site design. Program, to provide a variety of spaces on site which foster social interaction; this includes community kitchens, community growing beds, resource centre and a hydroponic demonstration area. Through providing spaces which will facilitate gathering of people and the exchanging of information and ideas, the hope is that people will bond over the universal interest of food. Site circulation, will aid in reconnecting people as growing beds are intertwined with public spaces surrounding the site, blending of public and productive spaces will aid in generating conversation, allowing the public to bond over food production. Site design, through situating productive spaces alongside public spaces, allowing exposure into the typically concealed area of food production will allow people to come together and converse over innovative approaches to food production.

88

RESPONDING TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL DISCOURSE
THROUGH DESIGN

In order to use architecture to alter the current relationship urban inhabitants have with food, and respond to the environmental discourse, innovation in site selection is required. Selecting a place within the city which does not allow for traditional means of agricultural production to occur, but will support hydroponic growing opens up greater possibilities for selecting desirable sites. Growing both above, and below grade will maximize on site production potential, as well, connections to underground transit systems can be made. The city environment would change if places without soil, an abundance of space or light were transformed to sustain indoor food production. Transporting food throughout the city using transit will provide a more sustainable method of distribution, having a direct impact on the environmental discourse.

RESPONDING TO THE ECONOMIC DISCOURSE
THROUGH DESIGN

The current relationship urban inhabitants have with agriculture is almost non existent prior to the market. Urban agriculture initiatives occupy parcels of land outside areas of high exposure, where land values are low. In order to change the current condition within the economic discourse, a high tech. facility of agricultural production must be positioned on land of high value, in an area which is easily accessible by transit, and situated among high density living. This will alter urban inhabitant's current relationship with agriculture as it will place agricultural right in front of the publics eyes, on real estate typically reserved for high valued investments. Altering where food production is placed within the city will alter how food is perceived.

89

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
ARCHITECTURAL RESPONSE

From the research conducted, investigating how architecture can alter urban inhabitants current relationship with agriculture, three themes have emerged which will inform the design decisions of the project response.The importance of these themes became apparent through precedent research, analysis of current local initiatives, as well in generating an approach which will impact the social, environment and economic discourses of the city. The objective is to alter the current relationship, which is one of disconnect between consumers and agricultural production. Therefore, the design principles are intended to create spaces which will change how agricultural production processes are viewed within the city landscape. Expose: To provide urban inhabitants with visual exposure to all stages of the agricultural production process. Engage To provide urban inhabitants with opportunities for engaging with all stages of the agricultural production process. Access To provide urban inhabitants with access to retail spaces where food produced on site can be purchased, from both transit and street level DESIGN PRINCIPLES
AG R I C U LT U R A L R E S P O N S E

As seen in part two, there are a number of strategic ways agriculture can be incorporated into an architectural proposal, which will enhance the relationship urban inhabitants have with food production. These approaches have generated three categories of engagement, described as follows. Agricultural production as a public experience, this approach created full contact between the general public and agricultural growing practices. These places were designed to foster engagement between the public and production by immersing people into spaces of crop production.

90

Agricultural production for public consumption, This approach separated the general public from any physical engagement with the production process. It maximized visual connection, through physical separation and fostered spaces for observation of practices within the growing spaces. Agricultural production for public demonstration, This approach allowed the public into designated portions of the facility, where there was limited engagement, but an elevated amount of knowledge gained about the process. Places of demonstration allow for the general public to be immersed within an environment similar to those of the risking crop contamination. PROGRAM PROPOSAL
ARCHITECTURAL RESPONSE

Toronto's urban agricultural initiatives provide a strong foundation for determining what types of programs to implement which will foster a strong connection to the surrounding community. Note, because the scale of operation is to be much larger than that of any existing initiative in Toronto, a greater emphasis is to be place on the retail portion of the facility. Open to the General Public - Public Gardens - Interior and Exterior growing - Hydroponic Demonstration Area - Community Kitchen - Resource Centre - Formal / Informal Gathering Areas - Food Market - Food Cafe - CSA pickup areas - Rooftop Gathering Area Separated from the General Public - Crop Preparation Areas (Sorting, Washing, Cutting, Packaging) - Distribution Circulation Areas - Refrigerated Food Storage

SITE SELECTION TORONTO, ONTARIO Placing agricultural production processes in central, desirable location are essential for altering the current relationship urban inhabitants have with agriculture. Currently, such initiatives are in constant com-

sq. ft. basis. When analyzing where to situate an agricultural production facility within the city of Toronto, many factors were considered. First, the statement is intended to be ground breaking, innovative and bold; therefore, an unconventional site is desired. Second, an area in the city which is easy to access, preferably situated along the transit line, a daily basis and impact the social discourse. Third, the site is to be considered prime real estate, directly responding to and altering the current connotations surrounding agricultural production within the city. Fourth, the site is to be placed at a location where there currently lacks presence of agricultural practices, altering the environmental discourse. Site selection would be greatly restricted if traditional methods of agricultural production were to be employed. However, as discussed in part two, given that Toronto is situated in a Canadian climate, with a limited growing season, alternative production practices are to be employed. Therefore, issues of lack of soil, light, space are not an issue for the site selection process.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION YONGE + EGLINTON The site is central to the Yonge+Eglinton and Mount Pleasant neighborhoods. Currently this area is under review and is generating proposals for a design called `Midtown Moves'. The goals include: - providing spaces for the community to come together - create a uniquely rich public realm - improve existing parks and make new ones The development comity has proposed creating a `Green Line' along Eglinton Avenue. Adding green spaces along this portion of midtown would be complemented by the addition of an agricultural facility central to this location, giving the initiative a strong presence near the corner of Yonge + Eglinton.

RESPONDING TO URBAN INHABITANTS
DESIGNING FOR DIFFERENT PROFILES

ricultural production differently. Therefore, it is important to identify a place of agricultural production. Transit rider facility if it is easily accessible within transit hubs. Spaces for purchasing food grown within this place for agricultural production need to be accessible within `fare paid zones' to provide greater convenience to riders. Given the nature of the subway being primarily underground, if riders are to have a visual connection with the agricultural production, it will have to be done underground.Thousands of people pass by the site on a daily basis, underground, using the subway system. With the addition of the metrolinx line, an even greater volume of people could be exposed to growing, if a portion is to exist underground. Community member, within the dense urban landscape, there will be an abundance of residents surrounding the place of agricultural prooffered at the site, as they will potentially utilized the place numerous times throughout the year. Access to a market and CSA pickup above grade is necessary, as this could be a place where the surrounding community purchases their produce. Urbanite in transition through the site will have a different experience as well. Their engagement with the site will be mainly above ground and outside the facility. Therefore, engagement at grade with growing practices and views into the intensive agricultural production areas are important for this

engagement and exposure with the agricultural production; however, the growing environment requires sterilization to minimize the chances of being exposed to diseases which will infect the crop. Physical cultural production are unavoidable. Therefore, the architecture must provide an innovative approach to visual engagement through physical separation of the two spaces.

125

PROGRAM PLACEMENT APPROACH The approach to program placement was the result of attempting to generate spaces which embodied the project's design objectives, providing exposure, engagement and access. Access, situating the access point to the Yonge subway and Metrolinx line in the north east portion of the site ensured easy access to the proposed transit hub development. Exposure, by giving the growing tower street frontage the site attempts to bring an agricultural presence to Eglinton Ave. Given the orientation of the tower, the South East, to North West portions of the facade are to be concealed from direct solar exposure. This prevents visual exposure into the tower; however, the North East corner condition, as well as the level at grade is to be fully transparent to allow the general public views of the intensive agricultural production happening within. Engage: by creating essentially two forms on the site, and dedicating the central area to the public realm, the intent is to engage with the pedestrian circulation along the Eglinton Ave..The position is intended to aid in achieving the goals of the Midtown Moves initiative, as mentioned in part six, - providing spaces for the community to come together - create a uniquely rich public realm - improve existing parks and make new ones This productive park is brought into the center of the site, and allows urban inhabitants to physically engage with the cultivation of food as well as providing an innovative approach to green space within the practices happening within the tower visually extends the greening vertically along the facade of the tower, third, the rooftops of the base of the tower carry the green initiative up to the existing under utilized rooftop of the neighboring building to expand the extents the site's public space.

APPROACH PUBLIC SPACE Providing exposure to and engagement with the public realm was crucial for achieving the design objectives of the project. Essentially opening up the building and immersing people within the void, converging over the topic of agricultural production is nearly unheard of within the context of Toronto. By dedicating only a portion of the site above grade to productive practices, the impact on the public realm is minimized, as a large tower would cast an overbearing shadow onto the public streets and greatly hinder the quality of space surrounding the site. By providing extensive opportunities for public engagement with agricultural practices, the intent is that a sense of community, knowledge and awareness of food's impact on the Earth will also be cultivated on site.

CLADDING SYSTEMS PROJECT PROPOSAL
The tower is clad with a conventional curtainwall system. The system contains vertical, horizontal and angled curtain wall mullions with a combination of 4 sided SSG (structural silicon glazing). The glass is held in place with vertical and horizontal the angled design intent. The intermediate angled glazing joint is done in structural silicone glazing, to minimize the visual appearance. At the spandrel locations, an insulated galvanized metal backpan has been introduced. The intent is to use +/- 130 mm deep curtainwall back section with semi rigid insulation to provide an R-20 insulation value. system has been introduced for the base buildings.The intent is to have cantilevered
