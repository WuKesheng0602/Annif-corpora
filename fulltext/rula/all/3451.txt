Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments

Abstract

Adaptive Reuse is a growing phenomenon embraced by cities as one of the low carbon strategies in their climate change agenda which shifted the focus from new construction to existing buildings. The research study is based upon cross-case analysis of four case study buildings selected from the inventory of conversion projects located within the context of Toronto. Analysis of the archived project documentations and unstructured interview with the involved architects were performed to identify key criteria and design strategies adopted for residential conversion. The key findings revealed that although the housing functions could be accomodated easily within the converted buildings; both interior and exterior aspects were demolished for residential configuration within both heritage and non-heritage adaptive reuse projects. The architects felt that such demolitions were necessitated due to lack of flexibility within its interiors; provisions for daylighting and thermal comfort; code compliances for fire and acoustic separations. Furthermore, findings from the current building regulations revealed a necessity for a separate policy tool due to lack of clarity for residential conversion within Toronto.

Key words: adaptive reuse; building conversion; code compliances

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1 Setting the context: Toronto Since buildings accounts for more than 50% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there are widespread concerns about the environmental impacts of existing buildings in the city. Therefore, Toronto City Council adopted climate change strategies1 to address energy efficiency and resource conservation (Toronto Atmospheric Fund, 2013).

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments of the existing buildings in downtown Toronto were constructed much before building codes, standards and energy performance measures came into existence (National Research Council Canada, 2012). Since 1834, the existing built environment in downtown Toronto experienced significant changes in form, fabric and function first due to industrialization, then suburbanization and lastly revitalization in the early 1990s (CMHC, 1996) (Toronto, 2014). As a result, some vacant industrial buildings were converted to different uses, but mostly to high-end office space or residential lofts. In some cases, additional floors were added atop the existing structure by developers, taking advantage of this opportunity to increase density requirements as per current zoning laws (Shipley, Utz, & Parsons, 2006). An interesting example of this is a new mixed-use development of incorporating the addition of seven floors of upmarket residential units atop fourteen floors of an existing 1960's office building, further built atop existing retail shops at 130 Bloor Street in Toronto (Quadrangle Architects, 2012). 1.2 Problem statement As Brand (1997) said that all buildings were built only for one purpose, it is evident that some buildings do not adapt well to ever changing scenarios as the original architects and engineers had not even considered various future possibilities during the initial design stages for buildings. In either way, it often resulted in demolition in part or whole of the building and then replacement, which are major contributors to environmental stress and landfill. Kincaid (2002) argued that building conversion can be an alternative to demolition and new construction, but it still does not determine any particular occupancy for any particular building. Even though recycling existing building stock can provide environmental benefits and embodied energy savings, the problem is that not 2

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments every existing building is a good candidate for adaptive reuse (Rabun & Kelso, 2009) (Wilson, 2010) (Burton, 2013). Due to more focus on new construction than existing buildings, it is often found that building conversion is not taking place on a large scale. The reason could be due to limited knowledge on building conversion. Hence there is a need to analyze the adaptive reuse potential within the existing buildings. 1.3 Research Questions Therefore, the research study seeks to answer the following questions:  Using several case studies, which key factors (both direct and indirect) of the existing building played a significant role for residential conversions; spatial and technical capabilities and their limitations?  How are code compliances and energy conservation measures addressed within the converted building due to change of occupancy? 1.4 Research Output The research findings from this study can have important implications for interested developers to initiate any residential adaptive reuse project. Furthermore, it could offer valuable insights to the architects on the decision-making factors that played a significant role in residential project outcomes, thus avoiding any major demolitions. By addressing such issues, it is also intended to provide the policy makers sustainable recommendations to redevelop existing built-up areas and enhance adaptive reuse process within the municipalities so that negative environmental impacts are minimized and reduced construction waste towards landfill.

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Chapter 2: Literature Review A review of pertinent literature was undertaken in two sections before and after in-depth analysis of the case studies. This was done due to a need to interpret common variables from the case studies such as building parameters, code compliances and associated construction technology.  The first section focussed on academic research published through government papers to scholarly publications. The goal of this was to understand the process of building conversion, critical factors, technical issues and energy conservation measures employed within its existing infrastructure during building

conversion/change of occupancy  The second section analyzed current building regulations for code compliances adopted during residential conversion within the context of Toronto in Ontario  Lastly, it concludes with an overall summary of the two parts of literature review along with the principles of adaptive reuse 2.1 Section I: Adaptive Reuse Scenario: This first section presents an overview of several theories based on the field of adaptive reuse interpreted differently through several perspectives of researchers, planners, architects and policy makers within several disciplines of preservation, sustainability, economy and planning for the built environment. In generic terms, the process of altering any building is often defined as "adaptive2 reuse", thus accommodates new functional requirements within its existing structure,

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments thereby extends its useful life and reduces its carbon footprint. Different interpretations for "adaptive reuse" are often known as retrofitting, conversion, adaptation, rehabilitation, refurbishment, etc (Brand, 1997) (Langston, 2011) (Douglas, 2006). Several design strategies were employed in converting buildings such as building within (connection between spaces), building over (additions or extensions), building around, building adjacent, etc (Douglas, 2006). Douglas (2006) and Bullen (2007) explained the difference between adaptation and adaptive reuse is that adaptation does not necessarily involve any change in use or function, instead it is viewed as refurbishment with upgrades to its energy performance. Traditionally, this preservation strategy for conservation of cultural heritage was often used for recycling structurally-sound historic structures across Canada to economically new uses as a cost-effective maintenance method to avoid disrepair and decay; also to prevent demolition (Cantell, 2005) (Langston, 2011). Examples are Evergreen Brick Works, originally brick-making industry converted to an educational campus, Distillery District (formerly manufacturing block) converted to an entertainment centre, etc. Comparison studies analyzed the environmental impacts associated with building reuse and new construction with life cycle assessment tool3 (LCA) over a 75-year life span in six different building typologies shown in Figure 2. The outcome findings revealed that it would take approximately 10 to 80 years for new energy efficient buildings to overcome

Furthermore, the large gap between 10 and 80 years could be attributed to different building typologies based on its locality and climatic zone as presented in Figure 2. But for warehouse to residential conversion5, it did not show any significant environmental savings because of quantity and quality of construction materials (Preservation Green Lab, 2012). Other comparison studies of life cycle energy analysis on three case study scenarios of renovating, reusing and replacing an historic building demonstrated how

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments the reused building with 70 percent of its embodied energy along with improved energy standards (operating) resulted in 34.2 years in total life cycle energy savings, 53.3 years for renovated building (30% energy efficiency standards) and 57 years for the partially demolished building. The determining factor was attributed to the historic building's (embodied energy) large volumes of durable building materials (Jackson, 2005). The above findings conclude that building layout, quantity and type of building materials benefit building reuse. Furthermore, environmental impacts can be reduced more by reusing existing buildings with less material input along with energy efficiency upgrades. 2.1.1 Evolution of the Built Environment:

This part of literature review explored several articles on what makes any green building truly sustainable and to clear up the misconception about energy efficiency and sustainability in relation to the green building industry. Literature studies clarified that energy efficiency is often related to economic savings and reductions of energy consumption whereas sustainability is often related to lower environmental impacts associated with GHG (Eldemery, 2014).

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Due to the growing energy-conscious practices for the past few decades, thus emerged a different perspective about the current building's life cycle with additional stages such as reuse, deconstruction and recycling as opposed to the traditional "cradle to grave"6 approach presented in Figure 3 (Graham, 2003). Scientific studies on life cycle energy usage7 of wood, steel and concrete framed buildings revealed how their building envelopes, structures and systems dominated seventy five percent of the initial embodied energy; although their overall life cycle stages had significant environmental aspects, especially when their operational energy displayed the largest part (more than 80%) of total energy demand (Kernan & Cole, 1996). Yet more comparison studies were studied on life cycle energy demand for both conventional and low energy buildings8 from nine countries (both residential and nonresidential) over 50 year life span. The findings revealed that total life cycle energy usage in conventional buildings showed larger proportions as compared to that of lowenergy buildings. Also embodied energy within low energy buildings was much higher (maximum of 46%) than that of conventional buildings (maximum of 38%); inspite of that, their operational energy usage still dominated in both cases. Further findings

6 7

"cradle to grave" refer to any product right from its creation to disposal (www.businessdictionary.com) Life cycle energy usage of a building is derived by summation of initial embodied energy (refers to

energy from extraction of natural resources till installation); recurring embodied energy (refers to energy for maintenance and refurbishment) and operating energy (refers to energy used by building occupants over its life span such as heating, cooling, lighting, etc.) (Cole & Kernan, 1996) (Sartori & Hestnes, 2007)
8

Conventional building refers to a building constructed as per common practice and low-energy building

refers to a building built with energy efficient technology to minimize the building's operating energy (<121 kWh/mÂ² year) (Sartori & Hestnes, 2007)

8

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments revealed that buildings constructed to Passive House (Passivhaus9) Standard proved more energy efficient as compared to self-sufficient solar house (Sartori & Hestnes, 2007). The above findings support that as the building's operational energy improves due to imposed strict building regulations and energy-efficient technology; the building's embodied energy shows relatively more significance. This part of literature review was explored on the relevance of the building's longevity by using the key terms "durability", "service life" and "design life".
Table 1: Key Terms and Definitions for Building Longevity Key terms Durability Definition Ability of any building, components or materials to resist the action of degrading agents for a long time Actual life span or period of actual time during which the building or any of its components performs without unforeseen costs or disruptions for maintenance or repair Predicted service life or intended life span of any product when subject to the test conditions according to a prescribed maintenance Adapted from (Nireki, 1996) (Kesik, 2002) (Douglas & Ransom, 2007)

Service life

Design life

According to Kesik (2002), the guidelines for durability in Canadian buildings "CSA S478-95 (R2001)" stipulated that heritage buildings should be designed for a minimum period of 100 years of service life; for residential, office and commercial buildings should be designed for service life between 50 and 99 years. Any building's service quality is

The Passivhaus (PH) standard is a set of voluntary criteria for an ultra-low energy use home. The

primary Passivhaus target criteria are: (a) total heating & cooling demand of <15 kWh/m2/year ; (b) total primary (i.e., source) energy of <120 kWh/m2/year and (c) airtightness 0.6 ACH@50 Pa or less (Straube, 2009)

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments instrumental in determining durability implications of any two buildng products even with similiar service life, they may deteriorate differently (Kesik, 2002). Stewart Brand's observational studies on different buildings and their evolution over their entire life developed a building model with shearing layers as presented in figure 4. It was argued that the shearing layers within a building have different life expectancies and for a building to be truly adaptive, these layers should be accessed easily instead of being enclosed together within any building system (Brand, 1997). Layer Site (Location) Structure (Slab) Skin (Envelope) Services (HVAC) Space (Interiors) Stuff (Occupants) Life Expectancy Permanent 30-300 years 20 years 7-15 years 3-30 years Daily

Figure 4: Stewart Brand's building model with shearing layers (Brand, 1997)

From Brand's model, it can be summarized on how any building can deteriorate within itself if such physical layers cannot be accessed for service and regular maintenance to increase the durability of such buildings and if left unattended, such buildings could worsen with age and decay (Douglas & Ransom, 2007). To determine relationship between building longevity and durability of structure, survey studies were conducted on 227 demolished buildings in Minnesota by building age, building type and structural materials; findings revealed major reasons for demolition such as area redevelopment (35%), physical condition due to poor maintenance (31%) 10

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments and buildings unsuitable for intended use (22%); also the majority of demolished steel and concrete buildings were less than 50 years old. It concluded that there was no relationship between the structural system and actual useful life of the building; furthermore most buildings were demolished not due to durability problems, but due to lack of adaptability10 (Athena , 2004) (Connor, 2004). Survey studies was performed on experienced building professionals across Canada on actual service life spans of 230 components (including equipments) in MURBs (over five floors in height) and their results were compared with Ontario Housing Corporation (OHC) life expectancy data; their findings revealed that they were higher than OHC life expectancies for 66% of the building elements (IBI Group, 2000). Economic studies on converted projects in Ontario dispelled the common assumption that reusing existing buildings are cheaper than new construction, hence the construction expenses of building conversion depends on the depth of client's requirements, size and function type, but the return on investment (ROI) for heritage development was found to be higher than that of non-heritage designated buildings (Shipley, Utz, & Parsons, 2006) (Stas, 2007). For example: the rate of construction costs for the conversion of a former power plant to Nova Scotia Power headquarters office was estimated at 2600 dollars11/mÂ² due to the clean-up for contaminated areas; but for the conversion of former Sears headquarters to government building at 222

Adaptability is defined as the capacity of a building to absorb minor or major changes and several

criteria of adaptability are convertibility, deconstruction, expandability and flexibility (Douglas, Building Adaptation, 2006)

To calculate prices per square meters, the calculation is as follows: (price/ftÂ²) x 10.764 = price/mÂ²

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Jarvis Street in Toronto, it was 2400 dollars/mÂ² and yet for converted office building (heritage-designated) at 111 Richmond Street West, it was 1700 dollars/mÂ² and comparative costs for new construction varies between 1900 dollars/mÂ² to 2150 dollars/mÂ² in Toronto (Blanchaer, 2013). Therefore it concludes that there is not much difference between the development and construction costs for both new buildings and converted buildings except for buildings on contaminated sites. 2.1.2 Obsolescence

Building obsolescence is defined as the process of declining performance over time until the end of its service life; also it has been termed as the fourth dimension in building because it determines the timing of either adaptive reuse or demolition of a building, while the other three dimensions are length, breadth and depth within space (Douglas, 2006) (Thomsen & Flier, 2011). Studies by Thomsen and Flier (2011) explored various literature articles on the role of obsolescence and its effect on the built environment. Their findings concluded that any building can technically be obsolete before the end of its physical life (age); how the differentiation in residential and non-residential buildings is marked by longer life cycle expectancy (stability) in housing as compared to shorter cycle of usage within offices or retail; how circumstantial factors for decay and obsolescence are determined by its physical design (spatial and structural flexibility), construction quality, occupants' behaviour (high utility expenses) and building management. Other research studies defined several types of building obsolescence during its service life differently in terms of both external and internal factors. They are characterized by physical (environmental factors due to deterioration, incompatibility between materials 12

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments or elements and structural failure due to seismic factors), economic (factors due to change of current market, rental rates, capital value, etc.), functional (occupant activities, degree of usefulness or insufficiency within building configuration or lack of maintenance), technological factors (due to modern equipment, information age), social (changes in style or expectancy levels), legal (code compliances, changes in policy, asbestos) and aesthetic (lack of appeal in existing architectural style, example: offices) (Langston, 2008) (Douglas, 2006). According to Douglas (2006), there are two types of problems which determine the feasibility of building conversion as follows; remedial type refer to poor thermal standards, construction defects, inadequate structural capacity and inadequate mechanical services which can be corrected through adaptive reuse; but for impractical type, it refers to factors such as poor location due to inaccessibility, inadequate building morphology due to restrictive parameters12 and severity of site contamination, therefore cannot be considered for any project redevelopment and should be demolished. Adaptive reuse is considered as one of the most effective strategies to counteract building obsolescence and other major strategies also include regular maintenance, refurbishment and upgrading (Douglas, 2006) (Langston, 2008). 2.1.3 Decision making Process This part of literature review researched first on the scenario of residential conversion across Canada and subsequently on the decision-making approach on the suitability of the existing building for its proposed use.

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments CMHC studies (2004) showed how residential conversion of obsolete non-residential buildings involved warehouses, religious buildings, educational facilities and offices were due to various reasons such as brownfield reclamation, affordable housing, revitalization, urban infill across Canada. For example, residential conversion in Montreal was adopted out of a need for affordable housing13 (CMHC, 2006), but for Toronto, it was used as downtown revitalization for the surrounding neighborhoods to generate tax revenues when the industrial buildings were abandoned (Mawani, 1997). According to Kincaid (2000), there is no standard method in determining any building conversion for any particular use as every building is different. Studies by Rabun and Kelso (2009) on building evaluation for adaptive reuse provided guidance on exterior and interior inspections for the existing building on its suitability for reuse. Furthermore, it evaluates structural and material integrity of existing buildings along with mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems according to its construction period. It also identifies the causes of building failures ranging from masonry spalling to foundation issues (Rabun & Kelso, 2009). For typical new project development, the standard procedure consists of typical phases such as site selection, pro-forma14 analysis, feasibility and acquisition, design, financing, marketing, leasing, construction and operations. But for adaptive reuse development project, a different approach is adopted due to the proximity of the existing building to the surrounding neighbourhood and therefore this

14

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments particular decision-making procedure goes through certain phases such as market analysis, pro-forma analysis, feasibility studies for the proposed occupancy15, analysis of existing site for any contamination, current zoning, check for heritage designation of the existing building, footprint size of the building for spatial configuration and physical compatibility; code compliances for its proposed use (Rabun & Kelso, 2009) (Bond, 2011) (Wilson, 2010). Due to the complexity of conversion within today's buildings, intensive collaboration emerges between several specialists from different backgrounds as it was felt that if done right at the beginning, it results in energy savings throughout the project as against the traditional collaboration between only architect, developer and contractor team arrangement (Rabun & Kelso, 2009). For the existing building on detailed evaluation, the first approach is to determine its economic feasibility; then technical audit to determine building history by date and its previous use; walk-through visual inspections of the building envelope for identifying any incurred damages due to moisture, human-inflicted and seismic; then preliminary assessment of building permits for fire safety and code issues, verification of existing working drawings with the existing condition and determining whether it is heritage designated or not (Rabun & Kelso, 2009). For heritage designated buildings, preservation specialist is often employed for collaboration and in such cases, the exterior fabric is maintained in its original condition and interior modifications often occur

Furthermore, survey studies were performed by Wilson (2010) among several property developers on their selection criteria of industrial buildings for adaptive reuse in Toronto and the results revealed critical factors presented in table 2.

2.1.4 Energy Conservation Measures: For new constructions, low energy-saving strategies are typically employed during the initial design stages such as its climatic orientation as per local zone; built form for daylight harvesting, energy-efficient and durable building materials. But the approach for renovating existing buildings is different and therefore, this part of literature work reviewed adoption of energy conservation measures (ECMs) during building conversion for both heritage and non-heritage types. Studies on typical construction technology in most of the existing building stock across Canada revealed that those built before Second World War were of load bearing masonry walls with little or without any insulation along with punched windows (Straube & Schumacher, 2007). Even though steel and reinforced concrete were discovered earlier, they became a commonality in the early 20th century. Buildings were typically constructed with skeletal structural systems often with non-load bearing walls, higher window to wall ratios and heavy mechanical systems. Economy and speed of construction were of prime importance at that time. Investigation studies on the first 17

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments generation curtain-wall systems (1958-73) in the office buildings located at Manhattan revealed that most of them were of single glazed type and not feasible for adaptability due to tight column spacing (6m by 6m as compared to 12-14m today), low ceiling heights (2.44m) and insufficiency load capacity of the faÃ§ades to support the weight of double glazed systems. Comparison studies on total energy usage for retrofitted building (15 F.A.R18) versus replacement building (21.6 F.A.R) was simulated with eQUEST19 program. Findings showed 40% energy reductions with payback period of 44 years for retrofitted building (15 F.A.R) and 5% operational energy savings for replacement building (21.6 F.A.R). But for replacement building, the embodied energy required to deconstruct the existing structure for a new one would be offset by 15.8 to 28 years (Browning, Hartley, Corey, Ryan, & Kallianpurkar, 2013). Straube (2012) emphasized that the first step to improve overall energy performance of any existing building was exterior application of continuous insulation protected by cladding over the entire building enclosure to control thermal bridging20 and airtightness; this ensures protection from temperature and moisture fluctuations. And for buildings with higher WWR or curtain wall systems, Straube (2012) advised that the window

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments selection should be limited to double glazing with low-e coatings, low u-value21 and low SHGC22 types (SHGC type depends on specific site conditions and exterior shading, if it exists) with thermally broken window frames for greater energy savings and thermal comfort. But for heritage designated buildings, exterior insulation strategy is not suitable due to concerns about elimination of their distinct historic features and restrictions under Ontario heritage act23, therefore interior insulation with spray foam (depends on construction type) were recommended as alternatives applied to address current energy standards or thermal comfort; the disadvantage resulted in reductions of the interior floor areas and does not prevent thermal bridging in certain areas such as structural penetrations (Straube, 2012). Field studies on hygrothermal performances of historic masonry exterior wall systems (within steel frame type) were carried out with several sensors placed at specific areas for comparison of thermally insulated (semi-rigid fibreglas type) wall applied with vapour barrier (aluminium foil) and ventilated air space technique on the interior side and noninsulated wall; findings revealed temperature differences across both walls (figure 5), thermal bridging between the junction of floor and masonry walls and moisture changes

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments within walls along with surface condensation; renovated (insulated) wall showed increased thermal resistance by 47% to 63% more than uninsulated wall (Results showed RSI24 value of 1.9 for uninsulated wall and insulated wall with RSI value of 1.2) (Maurenbrecher, Shirtliffe, Rousseau, & SaÃ¯d, 1998).

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments interior walls of the building were retrofitted with three layers of 2 inches of extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation adhered to existing masonry with polyurethane adhesive and wood 2x4 framing was installed for mechanical services along with spray foam at the joints (Figure 6). Their findings revealed how the north and east sides of the building displayed higher moisture content inspite of lack of decay within the wood members; south side (solar-heated) demonstrated decent moisture content (10%-13%) thus proving that climatic orientation matters for unheated buildings. Further findings showed reductions in their freeze-thaw cycles by half for uninsulated walls, thus increasing the rate of cooling. After addition of interior heating, it helped in drying up joists (Ueno, Straaten, & Schumacher, 2013).

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments frequency of freeze-thaw cycles due to the addition of thermal insulation, it is necessary to reduce the moisture content of the masonry structure. This insulation strategy contains an application of 2 layers of 10mm Mortairvent placed against the brick wall to create a vented cavity (20mm) located between solid masonry walls and spray-applied urethane foam insulation. Side by side tests were monitored by assessing wetting and drying cycles on vented and non-vented masonry walls for one and half years. Results showed that the vented cavity on south and east facades removed 4.8kg and 12.3kg of moisture, respectively, thus proving effectiveness in moisture removal during both winter and summer (Tzekova, Pressnail, Binkley, & Pearson, 2011)

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Straube(2012) emphasized that windows are often the major source for air leakage and moisture penetration thus increasing cooling loads or heating loads, depending on the climatic zone. Therefore they are often targeted as the first option for improving a building's thermal performance. Further literature review on historic windows were carried out and field studies were monitored with thermocouples at the window corners for performance issues on window condensation as a result of residential conversion of heritage building in Ottawa. Findings for single-glazed windows with wood-frame and metal-frame types revealed that condensation occurred at exterior temperatures of 10Â°C or lower when the interior conditions were at temperature of 21Â°C and relative humidity (R.H.) of 35%; condensation occurred on the metal frames, but not on wood frames. To address such issues, the dew point of the air adjacent to the window should be less than the temperature of the window. Therefore two options were considered; replacement of the single glazing with double-glazed units (low-e27 +13 mm air space) resulted in RSI value of 0.35 at centre and RSI value of 0.20 at the edges; other option was by addition of air-tight storm windows to the interior of the original window as the third layer of glazing; as a result that their improved thermal performance led to reductions in window condensation (Brown, 1997). Infrared thermography inspections were performed to address thermal patterns and identify freeze-thaw problems within historic buildings and it concluded that infrared thermography should be used for early detection of problem areas as timely remedial

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments actions would ensure long-term life cycle of heritage buildings (Colantonio, 1997). From the above conclusions, it showed a commonality in durability issues such as interior condensation for both windows and interface between insulation and masonry walls; risks of freeze-thaw cycles within masonry walls and replaced mechanical systems. Simulation studies by using IES-VE28 software were performed on occupancy patterns due to conversion of office building to residential apartment within urban settings to check on performance implications if heating and cooling demands were affected by change of occupancy associated by function within the existing building. The method of street geometry with ratio of H/W29 was calculated along with climatic orientations as urban settings. For isolated settings, the dominant office energy need was for cooling and for residential buildings, it was heating. Findings revealed that daytime shadowing improved energy performance for offices (reduced cooling loads) and increased heating loads for residential buildings within urban settlings. Yet during nighttime, findings showed reduced heating loads for residential buildings and increased cooling loads for offices. The findings conclude that a closer examination of the urban settings of a building, in conjunction with its intended use, can be instrumental in decision-making for improved energy performance (Futcher, Kershaw, & Mills, 2013).

28

IES-VE software is an integrated suite of applications linked by common user interface and provides an

environment for detailed building evaluation with regard to comfort criteria and energy use (Crawley, Hand, Kummert, & Griffith, 2005). It was employed due to its suitability for examining energy performances of multiple buildings at the same time (Futcher, Kershaw, & Mills, 2013)

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments 2.2 Section II: Analysis of Code Compliances for Residential Conversion This section first reviews the current building regulations in Canada and subsequently analyzes code compliances only for residential conversion from National Building Code of Canada (NBC), Ontario Building Code (OBC) and Toronto Green Standard (TGS). Building codes are legal documents that set minimum requirements for every building to qualify for any construction work and it does not prevent any builder from exceeding them in Canada (Potworowski, 2010). Building codes are upgraded every few years on a regular basis to address changing needs of the society and technological advances in building products. Historically in Canada, building codes were safety regulations concerned with consequences of poor hygiene, building failures and fire protection; at that time, its purpose was to avoid loss of property and life (Hutcheon N. B., 1969). Over the years, the building codes have expanded to include barrier-free accessibility and energy conservation requirements (OBOA, 2014). CMHC studies showed that a large number of buildings in Canada were constructed much before the building codes were introduced in 1941. Engineers find it a straightforward process to apply building code requirements to new buildings due to their alternative design options as compared to existing buildings as the existing buildings have limited options for economic design and constraints (Hansen, 1984). Adaptive reuse projects typically face difficulties in code compliances especially when the original function of the building is fundamentally changed to another function due to different requirements as per occupancy classification in current building regulations (Green, 2012). Still, code compliances are mandatory as they are the minimum standards set for the life safety of the building occupants. 25

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments 2.2.1 National Building Code of Canada (NBC): By definition, National Building Code of Canada (NBC) is one of the five model national construction code system established by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). Furthermore they are reviewed every five years and the current version is dated 2010; their main objectives are based on safety, health, accessibility, fire and structural protection of buildings across Canada, but different provinces or territories have additional codes such as water conservation and energy efficiency. Hence they serve only as model codes30 and become legal if they are adopted by territories and provinces. Even though NBC was first introduced in 1941, Part three31 (Use and Occupancy32) of NBC was first introduced in 1980; subsequently, guidelines for existing buildings were introduced only in 1993 (NRCAN, 2012). Prior to 1941, the Canadian municipalities would develop their own building codes for construction. The findings conclude that there is no reference to "change of use" in existing buildings within National Building Code of Canada.

30

Model Codes are technical documents with minimum building requirements which apply to the

construction, renovation or alteration of all buildings and become law only when they are adopted officially by province or city in Canada. (Potworowski, 2010) There is a difference between codes and standards as Building Standards are defined as voluntary industrial technical requirements for testing, compatibility and performance. (National Research Council Canada, 2013)
31

Part 3 refers to Fire Protection, Occupant Safety and Accessibility in both large non-residential and

residential buildings greater than three floors and greater than 600 square metres in built up area.
32

Occupancy means the use or intended use of a building or any part of a building for the shelter or

support of persons, animals or property (Service Ontario, 2014)

26

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments 2.2.2 Toronto Green Standard (TGS):

Historically Toronto Green Development Standard was first introduced as voluntary standards in 2006 due to environmental concerns from high rise glazed buildings amongst both public and private sector in the city of Toronto. In 2010, it was renamed as Toronto Green Standard (TGS) under the Planning Act (Kesik & Miller, 2008). On further analysis of TGS, it contains two-tier set of energy conservation targets for both site and building design in Toronto. Tier one became mandatory for new constructions since 2010 while Tier two is based on voluntary type with more aggressive measures than Tier one. According to TGS, there are two type of building categories characterized by: low-rise residential (maximum of three floors and five units) and mid-rise to high-rise (any major occupancy33 with minimum of four floors). Additionally, if buildings met specific targets within Tier two, they were eligible for twenty percent refund of developmental charges. Currently, TGS increased energy targets for Tier one: 15% above current OBC 2012 or 25% above Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB)34 and for Tier two, it is 25% above current OBC or 36% above MNECB.

33

Major occupancy means the principal occupancy for which a building or part of a building is used or

intended to be used. (Service Ontario, 2014)
34

Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB) was first published in 1997 and was never

adopted by any province; but it was used as national standard for building energy performance as well as reference building in energy simulation programs. The second edition of National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB) was published in 2011; their reference building was an improvement of 25% over MNECB reference building. It becomes law only when adopted by any province. (NRCAN, 2014)

27

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Even though, the current TGS does not address code compliances for conversion or renovation of the existing buildings, but Toronto municipal code specified that for any building conversion, the zoning compliance should be followed as per permitted building occupancy (Toronto, 2011). And furthermore, the building is defined not lawfully existing if fifty percent or more of the main walls of the first floor or above are removed or replaced (Toronto, 2014). According to TGS Tier two, voluntary measures are included for reuse of the existing building. In the previous version of TGS, the option "reuse of building materials" under Section "SW 2.1" in Tier two of TGS specifies that at least 5% of the existing building content should be reused. Recently, the updated version of TGS improved the terms under "reuse option" in Section SW 2.1 (Tier two) which stipulates that existing buildings not listed on the heritage register should reuse minimum of 55% of its existing structure and envelope (City of Toronto, 2014). Its main goal was to preserve the city's built form and reduce waste towards landfills (City of Toronto, 2013). 2.2.3 Ontario Building Codes:

Historically, Ontario Building Code (OBC) was first introduced in 1975 and applies to the entire province of Ontario, enforced under Building Code Act 1992 by the Ministry of Municipal affairs and Housing (MMAH) (Govt of Canada, 2013). According to OBC, an existing building is defined as any building which already existed for a minimum of five years. Any building which exists less than five years is required to be upgraded to the current standards of OBC (Code Reference: 1.1.2.6) (Service Ontario, 2014). In Toronto, whenever any existing building is reused and in such cases the occupancy usage is changed for example: from factory to residential, retail showroom to offices. 28

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Due to change of occupancy, there may be fire and code issues due to different requirements; therefore both Part 10: Change of Use and Part 11 for Renovation within OBC addresses code compliances for any building conversion (Service Ontario, 2014). Fire and life safety, structural aspects, plumbing, mechanical and accessibility requirements are identified as priority areas in such cases. Part 10 on "Change of Use" stipulates that the reused building should satisfy the requirements of the new occupancy. Furthermore, if the reused building has multiple occupancies for example, live-work units, then the building which has more built up area with a certain occupancy as long as the performance level of the converted building is not less than the performance level of the previous occupancy (Code reference: 10.3.2). Conversions of Existing Buildings falls into three types as follows: a) Classification according to major occupancy: Every existing building or any part of it should comply with requirements of the proposed occupancy such as life safety, fire ratings of the existing building assemblies, plumbing, sewage and accessibility as per major occupancy listed in Part 3 of OBC b) Building size and Construction type: This refers to structural evaluation for dead and live loads of the proposed occupancy, building size (based on built-up area and overall building height) and for combustible or non-combustible construction c) Classification according to construction index (CI)35 based on construction type and Hazard Index (HI)36 based on occupancy type (code reference: Part 11.2.1.1)

35

Construction Index is a number between one and eight; with one for the lowest fire protection

performance level, and two types of construction based on combustible and noncombustible.

29

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments as presented in Table 4. If the existing building (applies to small and medium size only) is surrounded by multiple streets, then HI credit of 1 can be subtracted from HI of the proposed occupancy for reduced upgrades required. Example: If this warehouse with Group F- Division 3 industrial occupancy (low hazard) is converted to Group D (office) or Group C (residential) occupancy. Then C.I and H.I are compared for analysis of any additional upgrades to the existing building. If results show that H.I is higher than C.I., then additional upgrades will be prescribed as per list of compliance alternatives in OBC. In such cases, typical solution could be sprinkler system for fire code compliances (OBC Reference: 11.4.3.4.A).
Table 4: Comparison of Hazard Index (Service Ontario, 2014) Hazard Index Occupancy Type Small Residential (Group C): Apartments Residential (Group C): Live/Work Units Business (Group D): Offices Business (Group D): Public Heritage Industrial (Group F Division 3)37: Warehouse Industrial (Group F Division 3): Public Heritage 3 4 3 3 2 3 Medium 4 5 4 3 3 Large 6 7 5 4 -

36

Hazard Index is measured on a scale of one to eight and based on occupancy type and building size. It

is for the safety of the occupants in terms of fire exits, difficulty of egress, etc.
37

Group F Industrial Occupancy are classified in three divisions; F1 are high hazard industrial, F2 are

medium hazard and F3 are low hazard industrial (Service Ontario, 2014)

30

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Even though energy conservation requirements were enforced for all new construction since 2012, but they are not required to be upgraded for existing buildings except on altered parts during renovations and additions (OBC reference: 11.3.3.2). OBC Part 11 on Renovation are classified in two types: Basic Renovation and Extensive Renovation (OBC Reference: 11.3.3). During basic renovations, minor alteration work could be carried out as long as the structure, fire separations or fire exits remains intact. When there is a change of use, for example: office or industrial type to residential type, building codes upgrades are required because residential occupancy have a completely different set of safety regulations in terms of fire-resistance ratings and acoustic separations (passage of sound between apartments). For extensive renovation work on removal and construction of building assemblies, then structural and fire-resistance standards of new building assemblies should be constructed according to the current building regulations for new buildings. The building height and building area are used for determing fire resistance rating requirements. Part 4 on Structural Design compared the specified uniformly distributed live loads as per occupancy type presented in Table 5
Table 5: Comparison of Live loads as per occupancy type (Service Ontario, 2014) Occupancy Type Factory or Industrial Live Load 6.0 kPa 2.4 kPa (for floors above first level) Office 4.8 kPa (for basement and first level) Residential 1.9 kPa

31

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments For building conversions, additional upgrades are required for fire, structural, plumbing, sewage and other service systems according to occupancy type and occupant load. 2.2.4 Heritage Designated Structures:

Toronto's current inventory of heritage properties already contains 9,000 properties within the City of Toronto, approximately 4,500 of them are legally designated under the Ontario Heritage Act (City of Toronto, 2014). For Toronto, listing properties of historic or cultural value is the responsibility of Heritage preservation services (HPS) appointed by Toronto city council since it was formed in 1973 and their inventory is further subdivided into inventory of heritage properties38 and heritage conservation districts39 under Ontario Heritage Act (City of Toronto, 2014). Building codes were unfavored by preservationists as they felt that building codes resulted in a loss of several heritage buildings. Fire sprinklers and other fire safety systems were often used as practical alternatives for heritage buildings and some building codes were revised to provide flexibility without loss of life safety (Green, 2012). Typical code upgrades occur during conversion of buildings (non-heritage) such as installation of modern mechanical systems for new occupants, life safety, seismic and accessibility requirements. But if the existing building is heritage designated, then it is compulsory for the developers to apply for permission from the municipality permit on either alteration or demolition of any of the elements in that building as per Ontario

38

Furthermore there may be relaxations from the building codes as long the chief building official has the authority to declare it impractical if it is detrimental to the preservation of the heritage attributes according to the compliance alternatives (OBC Reference: Section 10.4). Furthermore, the municipal codes of Toronto in Chapter 629-43 to 629-49 on Property standards defined that there should not be any alteration or any demolition of heritage properties unless permitted by Ontario Heritage Act (Toronto, 2013). When a heritage designated building is converted to another use, it is referred to rehabilitation according to the Ontario Heritage Act and it allows certain exceptions in other parts of Ontario Building Codes, but mandatory for structural and fire code requirements. 2.3 Section III: Summary on Principles of Adaptive Reuse This part summarized the existing literature on adaptive reuse of existing buildings and current building regulations for residential conversion. Literature-driven observable factors expected to have an impact on project outcomes were identified for location of the building, physical characteristics, influence of heritage designation and other factors are used as explanatory variables for analysis of the case studies. To sum up, physical building characteristics have been frequently pointed out as the most important factors that affected the selection of residential adaptive reuse projects. Furthermore, the success of residential conversion is also influenced by other major factors such as construction technology, quality and type of building material, context of heritage designation (depends on number of intervention levels); spatial configuration and technical considerations. A summary on the relevance of each major factor is presented in Table 6 with research highlights. 33

Example: mechanical parts become obsolete due to technological advances and also shorter life expectancies. Failure to do so, expenses arise.

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Chapter 3: Research Methodology Based on relevant literature review findings, this research study seeks to investigate decision-making strategies adopted by architects for their residential adaptive reuse projects, identify constraints with code compliances and energy conservation measures. Literature review on qualitative research methods for case study analysis revealed two types: in-depth analysis of a single object in real-life context and cross case analysis for similiarities and differences among several case studies (Schwandt, 2007) (Creswell, 2003). With the research questions in mind, it was felt that cross-case analysis of adaptive reuse projects was best suited in order to check for the commonalities among the converted buildings.Therefore, this research study was undertaken in three parts, first part on thorough literature review for background, second part on selecting case study buildings from the inventory of adaptive reuse projects for individual analysis and third part was on comparative analysis of collected data from all three study buildings with an overall evaluation. 3.1 Selection of Case Study Buildings Due to an abundance of adaptive reuse projects across Canada, the study area was narrowed down to the context of Toronto within the province of Ontario. An online survey revealed several residential adaptive reuse projects and the next step was to email involved architects with such residential adaptive reuse projects. Based on the architects's responses, the selected building typology was further narrowed down to residential type, irrespective of the previous occupancy. Table 7 shows an overview of the selected case study buildings (post conversion) that were studied.

Personal trips were made to their offices for in-situ analysis of the project archives along with additional information from the architects' (questionnaire41). The following parameters were analyzed: physical description of building before and after conversion; construction material, frame type, building parameters in terms of depth, width, height, etc., design strategies, energy conservation measures, code compliances and issues faced during the conversion process. 3.2 Limitations and Assumptions Considering an extensive amount of time already spent on this research work, an exhaustive review and technical evaluation of the buildings was not feasible due to lack of specific information concerned with building documentations and mechanical data. Additionally, most of the mechanical drawings of the converted buildings were missing/unavailable due to the observation that they were not archived. Only the

40

High Rise buildings are defined as those built with a minimum of four storeys according to Toronto

Green Standards (City of Toronto, 2013) and those built with seven storeys or higher according to Ontario Building Code (Service Ontario, 2014)

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments demolition plans and post conversion documentations were accessible from the architects's offices. Therefore, whatever missing technical information of the buildings were required, they were retrieved by online governmental sources. Even though it was easy to find several case studies on adaptive reuse, but the researcher found it difficult to retrieve financial data and utility records from unwilling property management offices and architects. They attributed it to their clients' privacy concerns and due to the Condominium Act which prevents them from divulging or disclosing any information of any kind.

Before Conversion: Tip-Top Tailors Building (Toronto Public Library, 1930)

Post Conversion: Tip Top Lofts (Bing Maps, 2014)

4.1.1. Before Conversion: The Tip Top Tailors building is located on the southwest corner of Lake Shore Boulevard West and Stadium road. Built in 1929, it was designed by Bishop and Miller Architects as the headquarters for Tip-Top Tailors, a menswear clothing retailer. Its original occupancy was industrial even though its main functions included both warehousing and office operations. Later on, this industrial building was abandoned due to the Great Depression. The historic structure with art deco elements was added by City of Toronto to their inventory of heritage properties in 1973, but officially designated in 2003 under Ontario Heritage Act (City of Toronto, 2002). Built form: The existing five-storey building was built as a U-shaped structure (figure 8) with a central courtyard and four corner towers with sculpted cornices. The raised

Figure 11: Layout Plan of Tip Top Lofts at Ground level (City of Toronto, 2004)

4.1.2. Post Conversion: Context Development company acquired the industrial site in 2002 and their proposal was to develop the industrial site in two phases. The heritage fast track process was adopted along with heritage ease agreement with Phase 1 scheduled for the rehabilitation work of the historic structure and Phase 2 scheduled for new development on the south part of the site (City of Toronto, 2002). The rehabilitation work undertook a period of four years from design stage till project completion by 2006. An extension of six floors of penthouses was built atop the existing fifth floor of the existing building. Its 39

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments overall (exterior) building height came to 47.5m. The converted building comprised of 243 residential units, including two-level penthouses above the existing structure with 50 different layouts varying from 55.74mÂ² to 240mÂ². The original ceiling height of the typical floors was 4.28m within the existing structure while the ceiling height inside the lobby was 4.55m and for the penthouse suites (extended building), average floor to floor height was between 2.8m to 3.0m. In a conversation on 23rd January 2014, the architect, B.Robinson explained on how the original plan was to build the new building extension out of concrete above the existing concrete structure. But the structural engineers felt that if the concrete material was chosen for the building extension, then it would be limited to four storeys due to its loadbearing weight. Therefore, lightweight steel construction was chosen as the main frame type with exterior insulation finish systems (EIFS) in order to enable six additional storeys atop the existing roof. Steel transfer structure with crawl space was introduced on the sixth floor level as extra reinforcement. Since the floor layouts were different from those above the existing structure, the crawl space served the purpose of transferring out mechanical works such as piping, fittings, etc. The steel transfer structure was tied into the elevator shear walls along with the new stair wells and existing columns for extra support (personal communication, January 23, 2014). From the documentations, it was evident that the new steel construction was set back by three metres from the concrete structure on the fifth floor level with full height glazing to the eleventh floor level as per heritage regulations. Thus the setback space served as open terraces without any damage to the decorative elements on the parapet walls. The

40

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments exteriors of the building were kept intact while the configuration work was done within the interiors of the building. The architect, B.Robinson confirmed that the heritage designated fountain was removed from the frontage lawns of the existing building so that excavation work on three underground levels could be carried out for additional parking. Once the construction was over, the fountain was restored to its original position. Even the decorative elements along with the signboard were maintained and restored whenever renovation was carried out within exterior and interior works. The existing basement level was maintained without any changes except for the connection between main entrance stairs and ramp was constructed for access to the parking underneath (personal communication, January 23, 2014). Zoning: As per original zoning, it was industrial type; therefore an application was made in 2002 for rezoning to permit residential conversion of the existing industrial building; for both approval of the proposed six-storey addition and to increase residential density to 24,763 mÂ² for the complex (City of Toronto, 2002). Code Compliances:  As per residential occupancy standards, it was found that existing car parking requirements were less than required. Therefore, the front parking area was excavated beneath to incorporate additional parking (155 indoor parking bays) on three underground levels along with 15 outdoor bays.   Barrier free ramp was installed next to the entrance stairs for accessibility. Since there was only one existing stairwell, four new elevators were installed along with two new stairwells built on opposite sides of the building due to change of 41

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments occupancy from industrial type "F" to residential type "C" according to number of occupants.  According to B.Robinson, there were code issues as per acoustic requirements and fire-ratings within the existing interior walls as per the proposed residential occupancy. Therefore all interior walls were demolited and replaced by new partition walls to ensure not only code compliances from both fire rating standpoint and meeting acoustic requirements, but also for interior configuration (personal communication, January 23, 2014).  The architect, B.Robinson was questioned about whether any problems with asbestos or harmful substances were faced in the existing building, his assumption was that the contractors had taken care of the asbestos removal prior to the building conversion (personal communication, January 23, 2014). 4.1.3. Observations: Architectural documentations: It was observed that the pre-conversion drawings were not archived and post-conversion archived drawings were on transparent paper. On further analysis of the drawings, insulation was not evident on the existing building exteriors because it was mandatory to maintain the original condition with art-deco elements as per heritage act, therefore the metal stud furring with semi-rigid insulation on the inner perimeter walls was provided for the existing structure. And for the extension building, it comprised of exterior insulation finishing system (EIFs). Since the

42

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments massive window openings were grandfathered43, they were maintained in their sizes. But existing window glazings were replaced by insulated glazing units (IGU's). Mechanical systems: According to the mechanical engineers, existing documentations of both original and existing mechanical systems were not archived once the project completed its construction (email communication). But the architect, B. Robinson confirmed that the previous mechanical and electrical systems were replaced by new energy-efficient systems. The old mechanical systems were not reused due to its worn out condition (obsolescence). But the mechanical systems were different for the existing structure and new extension. For mechanical working, the two-pipe heat pump system was installed in each unit of the building while the radiant system installed on the perimeter provided heating comfort for the existing structure. Sometimes more than two heat pumps were provided for the residential units, depending on their sizes (personal communication, January 23, 2014). On visual observation, exposed duct work was evident within the existing structure. The mechanical station, cooling towers and the elevator machine rooms were installed on the roof.

Figure 12: Before Conversion: Printing Factory (Bing Maps, 2014)

Figure 13: Post Conversion: Printing Factory Lofts (ArchDaily, 2011)

4.2.1

Before Conversion:

The lithography and printing facility was originally created in 1917 after two rival firms amalgamated to form Rolph-Clark-Stone Limited. It was located at Leslieville, one of the former industrial districts within Toronto. Its main function was for the printing presses and therefore its occupancy type was defined as industrial (ArchDaily, 2011). Zoning: The existing site was previously zoned as Employment lands. Around 1999, it was rezoned to mixed industrial-residential type with maximum height limit of 18 metres. It was enforced as part of Carlaw/Dundas neighbourhood improvement plan for Toronto (City of Toronto, 2006). Built Form: The original building was built as a rectangular three-storey masonry structure with the classical main entrance portico faced towards Carlaw Avenue and

44

Refer to Appendix D for construction drawings and calculations for demolished area

45

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments constructed on a raised underground level for workers's parking (Figure 10). The rectangular site along with building measured 97.49m (length) and 89.47m(depth). Its building area was 7347 mÂ². The building was clad with red brick walls and concrete bands above recessed windows. It exhibited typical industrialized features such as concrete floors, concrete columns, exposed brick masonry walls, high ceilings with heights up to 7.3m. Industrial saw-tooth skylights were provided for the workers' daylighting purposes (City of Toronto, 2006). 4.2.2 Post Conversion:

The joint venture between Montgomery Sisam Architects and Chandler Graham Architects converted the abandoned industrial complex to a mixed type of residential development. The residential complex consisted the central core of an eight storey condominium tower (new construction) flanked by two garden courtyards on either sides at podium level and surrounded by the U-shaped existing structure (Figure 11). Furthermore, three groups of stacked townhouses (new construction) were located behind the condominium tower and faced towards Boston Avenue on the east (ArchDaily, 2011). Heritage Designation: Prior to building conversion, this industrial building was not even heritage designated45. After submission of the building permits, the factory building was only recommended for inclusion on the City of Toronto Inventory of heritage properties46 in 2007. Therefore the West (Main) faÃ§ade facing Carlaw Avenue along with first three

45

Designated is a term for properties under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act, or are located within a

Heritage Conservation District designated under Part V.

46

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments bays of South faÃ§ade and its interior lobby with the staircase were listed as the heritage attributes (City of Toronto, 2006). Zoning: Even though the site was already zoned as mixed industrial-residential type, the rezoning application was made to increase building height from 18m to 28.5m and from 127 live-work units to 274 live/work units. Also the site was located between higher density mixed use areas on the north and lower density residential buildings on the east. Therefore, the proposed development in terms of massing showed a transition in between the higher scale of the condominium tower on the north and west and the low scale height of three storey townhouses on the east of Boston Avenue. Furthermore, the sun and shadow studies were also performed to show proof of access to light by adjacent streets and residences. The application got approved from the Municipality in 2006 (City of Toronto, 2006). Built form: The mixed type of residential complex preserved the front faÃ§ade and south faÃ§ade of the existing factory building as per heritage restrictions. About 65%47 of the central part of the existing structure were demolished into a U-shaped configuration bordering the north, west and south property lines as seen in figure 12. The U-shaped building (existing structure) was converted to live/work units, with two-level units at ground level and underground level.

46

"Listed" is a term used for heritage elements or properties built within Toronto for which Toronto City

Council has adopted a recommendation to be included on the Inventory. It is based on criteria related to architecture, history, and neighborhood context. Such inclusion is a clear statement that such heritage attributes of these properties should be preserved. This procedure is typically used before recommended for Ontario Heritage Act

Figure 14: Design strategies employed in the residential development seen on right (ArchDaily, 2011) Above: Existing Residential Complex

The reason for this demolition was necessitated due to deep floor-plate issues, therefore narrow residential floor plates were designed on an average of six metres depth on opposite sides of existing structure. The cutouts within the residential complex were implemented for daylighting and natural ventilation. The residential unit sizes varied from 50mÂ² to 175 mÂ². As per OBC minimum requirements, the ceiling heights for newly built townhouses was 2.7m; 3m for condominium and for existing live/work units, their ceiling heights varied from 3m to 7.3m. The conversion project completed its construction in 2010 and its overall project area including 274 residential units was calculated to be 21,470 mÂ². 48

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Code Compliances: Typical fire rating upgrades also involved fire escape stairs; acoustic separation requirements; accessibility requirements such as ramps, etc. Furthermore, 257 parking spaces were provided for the whole residential complex which includes 224 spaces for residents and 33 spaces for visitors (City of Toronto, 2006). Elements reused: The window opening sizes were maintained within the existing structure and some of the original sawtooth industrial skylights were integrated into the two storey loft units within the existing structure; Existing supply lines were reused for mechanical services (B.Collard, personal communication, February 21, 2014). Elements demolished:  Some of the original steel trusses for the skylights were replaced with structural metal stud framing systems because the steel trusses were too embedded within the demising walls (B.Collard, email communication, February 24, 2014)  65% of existing structure were demolished for U-shaped building configuration bordering the north, west and south property lines  architectural ceilings; partition walls; exterior metal fire escape stairs; roof membranes and roof cladding due to their worn out condition (obsolescence). 4.2.3 Observations:

From both existing documentations and site observation, it was evident that the heritage designated facades were not insulated on both sides of the walls, but the rest of the complex were insulated and constructed as per current standards for new construction within OBC.

4.3.1

Before Conversion:

The original building was built as the Imperial Oil Corporate Headquarters in 1957 and designed by the architectural firm, Mathers and Haldenby. Originally designed for Toronto's City hall, Nathan Phillips (Previous Mayor of Toronto during 1955) held an international competition and in the end, Imperial Oil bought the design for their head office in Toronto. The Imperial Oil Building is located two blocks west of Yonge Street

Zoning: Mixed Used Areas (City of Toronto, 2012) Built Form: The exterior building footprint measured in length of 74.37m (244feet) and width of 25.91m (85feet). The headquarters comprised of twenty floor levels of office space above grade, including the owner's two-storey penthouse at the rooftop set back on the flat roof with an observation deck and three floors for mechanical rooms at the rooftop level (figure 13). Three underground levels were provided only for building services and 350 outdoor parking bays for the office staff and workers. The total area of the old building was calculated to be 37,904 mÂ² (Barnicke, 2007).

Figure 17: Built form of Imperial Oil Building before conversion (R.Rowbotham, personal communication, May 5, 2014)

Heritage Designation: In February 2005, the Imperial Oil building was listed in the Inventory of Heritage Properties by City of Toronto and then legally designated on October 4, 2012 under Part IV of Ontario Heritage Act. Since the building was one of 52

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments the first steel-framed types in Canada, therefore it was heritage-designated. Other aspects such as exterior limestone faÃ§ade, marble and granite lobby, 10 metres high wall murals "The Story of Oil" and domed ceilings were also heritage designated (City of Toronto, 2012). Construction Technology: The exterior faÃ§ade was of Indiana Limestone cladding for the upper floors and polished pink granite for the lower two floors located at the base of the building. The original frame type was welded structural steel system. The floor type was tile/carpet over concrete filler on precast concrete slabs and ceiling type was plaster. The original two elevator banks comprised a total of eight elevators along with freight elevator. The original glazing of the windows were of single-glazed type. The original light fixtures included a built-in cooling coil to assist in removing the heating load (Barnicke, 2007) Original Mechanical Systems (Barnicke, 2007):  three natural gas fired boilers and fuel oil as back up; 8036 kW (27,420,000 BTU/h); perimeter hydraulic heating radiators (sill heaters) embedded into exterior walls; heating coils (peripheral heaters) mounted in ceilings for offices   Two chillers in lower basement and cooling towers on top level with 600/800 tons Twelve air handling units provided ducted supply and return air to all areas. Post Conversion:

4.3.2

After the Imperial Oil Company relocated their operations to Calgary in 2004, the office building was vacant for five years. In 2009, the developers, Camrost-Felcorp purchased the site along with vacant office building in 2010 and hired the architects, OneSpace Unlimited for the building conversion (Micallef, 2011). The proposal for the site was in 53

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments two phases, first phase was to renovate the office into 23 storey residential building and second phase was to construct townhouses behind the Condominium (City of Toronto, 2012). It was converted to "The Residences of Imperial Plaza" with 403 residential units with varying sizes from 51.56mÂ² (555ftÂ²) to 445.93mÂ² (4800ftÂ²); the construction started in 2011 and completed in 2014. Zoning: Mixed Used Areas (City of Toronto, 2012)

Figure18: Built form of Imperial Plaza after conversion (R.Rowbotham, personal communication, May 5, 2014)

Built Form: The existing building was maintained in its rectangular built form without any changes to its exterior faÃ§ade, but the interiors were demolished for reconfiguration of residential units (Figure 16). The wood paneling in the lobby suffered moisture damages from the recent floods, therefore it was stripped. Some ceiling openings were filled up at certain floor levels; both eighth and ninth floors had ceiling heights of 4.88m (16feet) which comprised of outdated air-exchanger and heavy-duty pipes and they were all demolished. As a result, 54 two-storey lofts were inserted both on eighth (24 lofts) and ninth floors (30 lofts). The existing mechanical system was also demolished 54

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments from the roof and additional residential floors were added to the vacant space. All the existing space-consuming massive mechanical equipment were removed from basement levels and the vacant space was designed for amenities such as indoor pool, lounges, fitness centre and retail areas. All existing windows, glazing and frames were replaced by extruded aluminium double-glazed sealed units, even though the existing window openings were maintained. All electrical fixtures were replaced also. Overall building area was calculated to be 42,746mÂ² (R. Rowbotham, personal communication, May 5, 2014). Code compliances as per Residential Occupancy, Type "C":  Rezoning application was made for site plan approval and additional parking requirements were provided in the three existing underground levels.  Rest of the code compliances were followed according to both parts 3 and 9 of OBC. All aspects of OBC section 3.8 have been addressed for accessibility barrier-free design throughout. Asbestos was removed as part of demolition work. Acoustic requirements of the OBC were addressed also.  Major challenges were faced due to difficulties in working within existing welded steel framing and floor systems because of upgrades required for fire ratings and acoustic separations as per OBC standards (the architect, R.Rowbotham, personal communication, May 8, 2014). 4.3.3 Observations:

From analysis of the documentations, it is evident that the floor plate depth was found to be 26.75m before building conversion. But the floor plate depths varies on different levels for residential suites and the maximum depth was found to be 12.5m for each 55

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments residential suite. Interior ceiling heights varied from 2.7m to 4.5m, but higher in some penthouses. Each floor plate measured 180mÂ² with existing column spacing of 3.7m (12ft) x 8.84m (29ft). The existing window sizes were 3m (10 ft) wide by 2.6m (8.5 ft) in height and its sill height was 0.76m (30 inches). According to R.Rowbotham, the architect explained that there was no insulation anywhere before conversion and since the insulation could not be applied on its exterior faÃ§ade due to the heritage regulations, spray foam (R19) insulation was instead applied on the interior side of the building envelope for improved energy performance (personal communication, May 5, 2014). All existing mechanical systems were removed due to their massive size and obsolete conditions and replaced by new compact mechanical technology with 2 pipe fan coil system for both heating and cooling requirements. The rooftop chiller disperses heat to provide air-conditioning and boilers heat water distributed throughout the building for heating (R.Rowbotham, personal communication, May 8, 2014). R.Rowbotham, the architect, confirmed about whatever evidence of asbestos was removed as part of the demolition work (personal communication, May 5, 2014). Furthermore, the documentations showed that the longer side of the existing building is orientated along east-west axis and research studies have shown that rectangular buildings elongated on east-west axis are better suited for maximizing their daylighting access (Straube, 2012) (Robertson, n.d.)

Figure 19: Mixed-Use Complex at 130 Bloor Street and Building Section (ArchDaily, 2011)

4.4.1 Before Conversion: The original office building with the rooftop penthouse was constructed in 1960 built by businessman Noah Torno. It was constructed on top of the existing Toronto subway system in Yorkville. It was designed with retail on ground level and typical offices from 2nd to 12th floor. On each floor level, the office space was 1500mÂ² (16,000 ftÂ²). The penthouse was built with a two-storey central atrium, high ceilings and wood paneled walls. The total floor area of the penthouse is 1000mÂ² (11,000 ftÂ²) plus terrace space of 420mÂ² (4,500 ftÂ²). Furthermore, the original office building comprised of approximately

58

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments 1900mÂ² (20,000 ftÂ²) of retail space and 3,000mÂ² (140,000 ftÂ²) of office space built above on ten floors along with underground parking facility (ArchDaily, 2011). 4.4.2 Post Conversion: Quadrangle Architects designed the converted building as an integrated mixed-use project and its construction was completed in 2010. But the existing penthouse was maintained in its originality on the 13th and 14th floor levels because of its heritagedesignation and it was set at an asking price for $30 million dollars. The high-end residential suites along with the existing heritage designated penthouse were equipped with a private gated entrance at 155 Cumberland and express elevators to a secluded rooftop and the office building was accessed from Bloor Street through the renovated lobby. The 21-storey mixed-use complex contained 10 floors of office space of 12545 mÂ² (135,000 ftÂ²) above retail shops and on top of the office space, it comprised 15 condominium residences on another 10 floors along with below-grade parking and retail shops at ground level. After converting 11th and 12th floors of the office space to residences, a building extension of seven new floor levels were stacked on top of the penthouse. The extension building was cladded with Indiana limestone and each floor contained high-end individual residential suite. The existing two floors below the penthouse, which were previously used for office space, were cut back to hold four new half-floor residential suites (ArchDaily, 2011). Built form: The overall rectangular built form contained 21 storey structure with the new extension of seven new floor levels built over the existing penthouse on the 14th floor level. As a result, the overall building height was increased to 88.7m (291 feet) with 14 residential suites and heritage penthouse. Portions of the existing structure on 10th and 59

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments 11th floors were demolished to create large terraces and residential spaces. As a result, some floors have two residential units and other floors have just one residential suite. Each residential suite ranged from 280mÂ² (3000 ftÂ²) to 560mÂ² (6000 ftÂ²) while the built-up area of the heritage designated penthouse was found to be 1000mÂ² (11,000ftÂ²). Their ceiling heights were 3.35m high with floor-to-ceiling glass to capitalize on the outdoor views of the city (ArchDaily, 2011).

The architect, Brian Curtner felt that it was a costeffective solution for the integrated complex (Derven, 2010). 4.4.3 Observations: It was observed that the existing built form was rectangular and is conveniently accessed on both sides for the residents and workers. Although the offices had generous floor to floor heights, which enabled greater day-lighting potential within the existing building. But it is obvious that only one new residential suite was setback on each floor level to overcome the constraining factor of deep floor plate issues. 4.4.4 Summary of Findings: Before Conversion Zoning Mixed Use Areas Occupancy Group D (Business) By Year Original built: 1960 Building Parameters (Existing Structure) Built Form Rectangular Heritage Designation Yes (only for penthouse) Number of Floors 10 floors Building height Frame type Post Conversion Unchanged Group C (Residential) Construction: 2010 Unchanged (for office

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Chapter 5: Conclusions 5.1 Future Work and Recommendations Due to the researcher's several attempts to retrieve required data on existing buildings within Toronto, it was felt that there is a strong necessity to create a database for the existing building stock such as building age, typology, construction technology in terms of historical background, building materials, mechanical services, plumbing and electrical systems, total built-up area based on occupancy types within existing buildings in Toronto. Such database can encourage researchers to perform energy assessment, evaluation of renovation potential of the existing building stock and retrofit strategies for building conversion. Other recommendations for more research work are: 1) Comparison of Energy Utilization Index (EUI)49 of the converted buildings versus that of new buildings to promote better energy standards for heritage buildings 2) Baseline comparison studies on thermal performance (air-tightness) of building envelope within suites between new building and converted building (heritage and non-heritage) through fan pressurization method. 5.2 Comparison of Case Study Findings: After analyzing the case studies, the summary findings from each case study building are input and compared for commonalities to determine the key factors as follows:

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments 5.3 Conclusions From the research work, it is often found that building conversion is a way of reusing vacant buildings in Toronto; yet both industrial and office buildings posed constraints and benefits during the process of building conversion for the Architects. Like for example, when there is change of use from Industrial type to Residential type, higher parking requirements are often achieved by excavating unused land. Not only for industrial buildings, but also post-war and 1950s office buildings exhibit moderate floor to ceiling heights and deep floor plates, which often are problematic to provide daylighting within residential units. This example could be seen from major demolition of the central portions of this particular industrial building, Printing Factory. The question remains on whether the Printing Factory Lofts should be considered as an adaptive reuse project? The researcher felt otherwise and considered Printing Factory Lofts as any other new project, not adaptive reuse project even though the front and side walls were preserved. Again this project cannot be considered for sustainability especially when the embodied energy from the old building are lost and all of which is added to the carbon footprint of the city. In view of the additional floors, they are suited for industrial buildings due to their high ceilings and it is considered as an investment for developers. But in terms of sustainability, it provides additional housing (live/work) for workers to live closer to their place of employment and minimize transportation from other areas. It was observed that all the converted buildings were initiated by private developers. Also the developers prefer heritage buildings to non-heritage buildings because of higher return on investment (ROI). The reason could be due to their clientele's aesthetic preferences and finanacial incentives for heritage development, beneficial for reducing 64

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments incurred expenses during the later stages of construction. The researcher felt that among the case studies, Imperial Plaza (business occupancy) compared far better than the rest in terms of existing zoning regulations already in place, existing underground levels for parking, simplicity of rectangular built form and less demolition work. When compared to business occupancy and industrial occupancy, the findings concludes that office buildings are better suited for residential conversions than warehouses and industrial buildings, but it depends on type of existing built form and structure type. Research Goals: The major research goal of this research study was to determine the key factors that influenced residential adaptive reuse projects outcomes. Therefore, the key factors were compiled together along with brief explanations as listed below: 1) Zoning Regulations: Zoning regulations were instrumental for determining building heights as additional floor levels were constructed atop TipTop Lofts, massing as per surrounding buildings and increased residential density for Printing Factory Lofts. Applications for zoning approval were made for TipTop Lofts and Printing Factory Lofts except Imperial Plaza Residences and 130 Bloor Street Residences. Due to additional parking requirements, excavation was undertaken for both industrial buildings. For Bloor Street Residences and Imperial Plaza Residences, existing underground levels were just converted for car parking, even though there was already existing outdoor parking bays due to the previous (business) occupancy for Imperial Plaza Residences only. 2) Physical Characteristics: Building parameters such as floor plate depths and ceiling heights played an important role in spatial configuration for residential suites. Another observation noted that additional two-level units were input for certain floor 65

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments levels with ceiling heights greater than 4.6m. Since the minimum ceiling height was 2.3m as per residential standards (Service Ontario, 2014), therefore extra ceiling height was taken advantage by installing mezanine levels for penthouse suites. 3) Built Form (Architectural): The type of existing built form and load capacity of roof are relevant factors that influenced residential adaptive reuse projects written below.  For Printing Factory Lofts, the existing square compact form was demolished by 65% due to deep floor plate issues (75m x 91m) and configured into U-shaped form with narrow floor plate depths of 14m surrounding the complex.  For TipTop Lofts the existing U-shape built form was maintained, but six additional floors were built on top of the concrete roof due to high load capacity and to take advantage of current zoning regulations for density.  For Imperial Plaza Residences, it was observed that the existing rectangular built form was orientated along east-west axis, which is an advantage for reducing electrical demand and maximise daylighting.  For 130 Bloor Street Residences, the built form was rectangular with the short edges (width) faced towards the streets and longer edges (length) without any windows due to adjoining walls. Therefore, the new extension was set back from the existing faÃ§ade for one residential suite per floor from 15th to 21st levels. For the 10th and 11th floors, the interiors were demolished for input of two-level penthouse suites on opposite sides. This strategy was due to deep floor plate issues for 130 Bloor Street Residence.

66

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments  Another commonality observed within all the converted buildings that the new construction on the upper floors were setback within line of sight to contribute towards existing streetscape. Code Compliances for Residential Conversion: 1) Another commonality from the case studies was demolition of interior partitions for fire ratings and fire exiting requirements, acoustic separations and accessibility as code compliances and also for residential configurations. For Imperial Plaza Residences, concrete levelling was poured atop existing floor for acoustic separation. It was found that there were no acoustic issues from the existing concrete floors in other buildings. Even though the architects did not mention any seismic upgrades for most converted buildings except for Residences at 130 Bloor Street West. For the other converted buildings, one possibility could be that they were already structurally sound. Even though Toronto is not in a high-risk seismic area, current codes stipulate that structural upgrades are required for earthquake protection, especially for old buildings. For Residences at 130 Bloor Street West, the existing office building was reinforced from its top down through the parking garage and around the existing subway system underground. 2) Installation of new stairs and new elevators were installed for TipTop Lofts (industrial building) for the occupants but the existing stairs were maintained for both Printing Factory Lofts and Imperial Plaza Residences. The existing elevator shafts were closed and new elevators were installed for Imperial Plaza Residences, but no installation of new elevators for Printing Factory lofts due to its low-rise type (two floor levels). 67

Adaptive Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential Developments Energy Conservation Measures addressed within converted building: 1) Even though energy efficiency requirements stipulated from the current building regulations were exempted for heritage buildings, insulation strategies were interior application of spray foam insulation in the case of Imperial Plaza building and interior batt insulation within the existing walls of TipTop Lofts. But there was no evidence of insulation for the existing faÃ§ade in Printing Factory Lofts (maybe thermal mass could have helped as a passive energy strategy!). Also another observation was that not all case study buildings adopted the same insulation strategy due to different construction materials. 2) Another commonality was observed for outdated mechanical, electrical and glazing systems. Replacing the windows with double glazing types, replacement of HVAC systems and electrical systems with energy efficient ones were typical strategies employed for better energy performance. 3) For the existing window openings in all the case studies, they remained unchanged due to "grandfathered50 codes". Since window area or window-to-wall ratio (WWR) is an important variable which affects energy performance in any building, high window-to-wall ratios could lead to unwanted solar heat gains, increased heating and cooling loads, thus costly. But it was considered as a financial advantage for the developers of residential adaptive reuse projects.

50

"Grandfathered" means legal use of property based on the legal existence of the use prior to a

modification of zoning ordinance or building code. In other words, it can be defined as "legal, nonconforming."
