Acknowledgements The topic of this research was originated from a book that was recommended to me by Dr. Pushchak in his Planning Theory class. It was Rationality and Power-Democracy in practice by Flyvbjerg, 1998. I was captivated by the Flyvbjerg's fascinating story about the relations between the planning decision-making process and power relationships and Dr. Pushchak's humor and wisdom in his class at the same time. Without encouragement and supervision from Dr. Pushchak, this research would be impossible. I would like to thank Dr. Pushchak deeply and sincerely. I also would like to thank deeply Dr. De Sousa, who took time to review my paper as a second reader.

  1.1  Backgrounds  and  Research  Questions  
                  The  recent  decision  by  the  National  Energy  Board  (NEB)  to  approve  the  Enbridge  Line   9B  reversal  and  Line  9  capacity  expansion  project  has  immediately  raised  many  criticisms   and  protests.  The  Toronto  Star  expressed  the  critics'  worries  in  the  account  below  ("Make   pipeline  even  safer,"  2014,  March  9,  A10):                   "Connecting  Sarnia  and  Montreal,  Line  9  traverses  Ontario's  urban  heartland,  crossing   every  major  river  in  the  GTA,  passing  through  north  Toronto,  and  coming  distressingly  close   to  the  Finch  subway  station.    Under  these  circumstances,  the  impact  of  a  major  spill  on   communities  and  the  environment  could  be  devastating."                 "The  38-year-old  line  may  have  hidden  weak  spots  that  could  give  way  under  the  pressure   of  this  increased  flow.  Making  fears  worse,  product  being  transported  from  western  oilfields   to  refineries  in  Quebec  could  include  diluted  bitumen  from  Alberta's  oil  sands  and  even   volatile  crude  from  the  Bakken  region  of  North  Dakota."                 The  most  important  aspects  of  the  criticisms  focus  on  how  the  National  Energy  Board   failed  to  take  advice  from  municipalities  and  Ontario's  Ministry  of  Energy  to  impose   "reasonable"  conditions,  which  include  performing  a  hydrostatic  test  and  requiring   Enbridge  to  increase  insurance  coverage  for  liabilities  ("Make  pipeline  even  safer,"  2014,   Mar  9,  A10).                 In  light  of  the  controversy,  this  major  research  paper  will  probe  the  decision-making   process  of  the  National  Energy  Board  for  the  Enbridge  LINE  9B  reversal  and  Line  9   capacity  expansion  project.  The  research  questions  included:  (1)  what  grounds  was  the  

  

1  

   decision  based  on,  (2)  was  decision-making  science-based,  and  (3)  did  the  Environmental   Assessment  component  adequately  address  the  risk  to  the  environment  and  affected   communities?    

1.2  Literature  Review  
                Yosie  (2000,  p.  216)  points  out  that  science-based  decision-making  is  "at  a  series  of   strategic  crossroads."  These  "crossroads"  include  the  changing  approaches  to  "managing   scientific  research  relevant  to  public  policymaking";  seeking  alternative  models  of   environmental  decision-making  to  those  that  "limit  the  application  of  scientific   information  and  challenge  scientists'  ability  to  effectively  participate  in  and  shape  the   outcome  of  public  health  and  environmental  decisions";  and  the  changing  expectations  of   what  science  can  and  should  do  "in  evaluations  of  public  health  and  safety  and   environmental  quality"  (Yosie,  2000,  p.  216).  Those  expected  changes  are  understandable   as  public  pressure  mounts  from  seemingly  never-ending  environmental  incidents  and   even  catastrophes.        The  literature  indicates  that  in  environmental  decision-making  practices,  science-

based  and  stakeholder-based  decision-making  approaches  are  at  odds  with  each  other  and   usually  are  not  reconciled  in  reality  (Yosie,  2000).  Some  research  has  discovered  that,  in   practice,  socio-economic  criteria  are  often  considered  as  important  as  the  availability  of   "robust  scientific  data  and  insights"    (Younger,  Coulton,  &  Froggatt,  2005;  p137).      What   lies  at  the  core  of  these  decision-making  processes  is  how  science  plays  its  role,  and  how   experts  exert  their  expertise.  However,  McGarity  and  Wagner  point  out  the  "accounts  of   `bending'  science--where  research  is  manipulated  to  advance  economic  or  ideological   ends--are  not  only  prevalent  in  the  corridors  of  courts  and  legislatures,  but  also  beginning      2  

   to  emerge  from  deep  within  the  inner  sanctum  of  science"  (McGarity  &  Wagner,  2008;  1  ).   Moreover,  much  of  the  literature  written  about  decision-making  practices  has  revealed   that  even  the  most  technical  decisions  can  be  affected  by  power  interests  (Fljvbjerg,   1998,Talor,  Kim  &  Gahbauer,  2009).  Flyvbjerg's  proposition  indicates  "rationality  is   context-dependent,  the  context  often  being  power"  and  it  will  be  "meaningless,  or   misleading...to  operate  with  a  concept  of  rationality  in  which  power  is  absent"  (Flyvbjerg,   1998;  227).  This  indicates  that  science-based  decision-making  is  dependent  upon  its   context.  There  are  also  some  researchers  who  criticize  this  Foucaultian  study  by  saying   that  "These  flaws  lead  to  very  grave  dangers  in  any  attempt  to  develop  a  planning  theory   based  on  Foucault"  (Stein  &  Harper,  2003;125)  and  "a  theoretical  privileging  of  the   vocabulary  of  power  could  blind  us  to  other  realities,  by  reinterpreting  everything  within  a   reductionistic  metanarrative  of  power  and  power  structures"  (Stein  &  Harper,  2003;  125).                       There  are  a  growing  number  of  studies  that  are  dedicated  to  the  precautionary   principle  "first  do  no  harm"  in  public  health  and  environmental  decision-making.  The   precautionary  principle  suggests  that  the  absence  of  evidence  of  evidence  of  harm  is  not  a   justification  for  proceeding.  Its  advocates  strive  to  have  it  "become  a  cornerstone  for   developing  policies  related  to  the  environment  and  public  health"  (Goklany,  2001;  2),   especially  when  decision  makers  are  facing  dilemmas.  However,  Goldstein  (2001,p.  1358)   pointed  out  "the  precautionary  principle  is  at  times  presented  by  its  supporters  as  a   rationale  to  stop  doing  scientific  research  on  a  subject."  It  is  interesting  to  see  how  far  this   principle  will  go.                  There  is  relatively  very  little  literature  that  specifically  focuses  on  decisions  about  

oil  pipelines.  However,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  some  researchers  have  studied  the  

  

3  

   assessment  processes  for  major  oil  and  gas  pipeline  projects  in  Canada.    Van  Hinte,  Gunton   and  Day  found  that  only  three  of  fourteen  best-practice  criteria  were  met  in  the  eight   proposed  major  pipeline  projects  in  Canada,  and  that  "the  most  significant  deficiencies  are:   lack  of  clear  decision-making  criteria  and  methods"  (Van  Hinte,  Gunton,  &  Day,  2007;123).   Additionally,  Hoberg,  Rivers  and  Salomons  have  compared  the  dynamics  of  pipeline   politics  between  Canada  and  the  United  States.  They  found  that  both  sides  had  made   prominent  efforts  to  "exert  political  control  over  the  regulatory  process"  (Hoberg,  Rivers,   &  Salomons,  2012;  21).    In  Canada,  "the  climate  issue  has  essentially  been  taken  off  the   agenda  for  the  pipeline  through  the  joint  Review  Panel's  narrow  scoping  decision"   (Hoberg,  Rivers,  &  Salomons,  2012;  23).

              This  research  used  the  in-depth  case  study  method,  combining  the  history-comparative   and  document-analysis  methods  to  reveal  the  true  nature  of  the  decision-making  process   in  a  political-economic  context.  This  research  was  approached  in  three  steps.  The  first  step   was  a  literature  review.  The  research  built  the  analysis  on  the  practical  decision-making   literature,  and  focused  particularly  on  the  research  in  science-based,  planning  and   environmental  decision-making.  The  second  step  was  to  conduct  an  in-depth  case  study   analysis,  which  aimed  to  provide  an  analysis  of  this  decision-making  process  in  a  historical   context.  This  step  was  conducted  in  the  following  sequence:  1)  the  timeline  of  the  project   was  provided  in  a  political-economic  context,  2)  an  analysis  of  the  actors  involved  in  the   decision-making  followed,  3)  an  analysis  of  the  factors  influencing  the  decision-making,     was  done  and  4)  an  analysis  of    the  interactions  among  those  actors  and  how  the  roles  of   those  science-based  factors,  especially  probabilistic  risk  assessment,  influenced  the

   outcome.  The  last  step  was  to  summarize  and  analyze  the  findings,  to  present  further   inductive  reasoning  regarding  science-based  decision-making.                         In  this  in-depth  case  study  process,  the  paper  used  the  historical-comparative  method   to  put  this  decision-making  timeline  into  a  larger,  historical,  political-economic  context.   Thus,  the  history  of  this  38-year-old  pipeline  was  found  in  the  testimony  of  the  changing,   social,  and  political-economic  context  in  which  the  current  NEB's  regulatory  decision- making  also  became  more  understandable.  The  document  analysis  method  also  played  an   important  role  in  the  research.  The  paper  tried  to  establish  a  review  of  what  happened   during  the  hearing  proceedings  (the  process  that  determined  the  decision)  in  the  past.     The  most  accurate  pieces  of  evidence  were  the  hundreds  of  filing  documents,  transcript   records,  written  arguments,  and  most  important,  the  written  expert  evidence.  What  has   been  said,  what  evidence  had  been  presented,  and  who  presented  it  during  this  NEB   decision-making  process  were  the  most  significant  facts  that  this  paper  relied  on.    Without   interviews  of  intervenors,  this  research  may  lack  insights  of  interview  suspects   retrospectively,  but  to  keep  a  distance  from  those  actors  may  also  maintain  a  distance   from  their  biases  that  are  often  shaped  by  their  interests  or  ideologies.  Except  for  the   hundreds  of  Board  orders,  compliances,  hearing  transcripts,  and  written  evidence  that  the   research  relied  on,  the  paper  also  used  many  non-traditional  sources,  including  hundreds   of  actors'  websites,  reports  and  interviews  in  the  newspapers.                               The  research  approach  was  a  conflict-centered,  retrospective  narrative  approach,   thus  the  analysis  of  the  main  actors  and  their  interactions  was  the  centerpiece  of  the  study.   The  paper  used  many  in-text  citations  in  order  to  bring  readers  back  to  this  controversial

1.3  Expected  outcome  
                Decision  making,  especially  risk-informed  regulatory  decision  making,  is  always  a   crucial  component  in  planning  practice  because  the  stakes  in  these  decisions  are  very  high   in  terms  of  social,  economic  and  environmental  impacts.    In  the  Kalamazoo  incident,   Enbridge  spilled  3.3  million  litres  of  oil  into  the  Kalamazoo  River  in  Michigan,  costing  the   company  more  than  $1  billion  (Max  Paris  Environmental  Unit,  2013,  Sep  06).  Based  on  the   Enbridge  2009  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Report,  there  were  "804  spills  that  released   161,475  barrels  of  hydrocarbons  into  the  environment"  throughout  the  company's  history   between  1990  and  2010  (Girard,  2010;  53).  In  terms  of  Enbridge's  Line  9  operations   specifically,  CTV  W5  uncovered  35  spills  since  1976  (Burns-Pieper,  2014).  All  these   incidents  remind  us  of  the  consequences  the  decisions  of  the  NEB  can  have.    Evaluating   one  of  the  regulatory  decision-making  processes  of  the  NEB  will  extend  the  literature  on   science-based,  environmental  decision-making.                       The  paper  did  not  intend  to  present  big  decision-making  remedies,  but  these  kinds  of   excavations  shine  a  light  on  aspects  of  the  decision-making  process  that  make  us   understand  the  problem  and  also  may  point  to  a  direction  for  the  solutions.

TWO              Timeline  and  Context  
                            Any  decision-making  process  cannot  escape  from  a  political  and  economic  context   and  cannot  be  comprehended  fully  without  it.    This  is  especially  true  for  oil  pipelines.     Pipeline  9  is  only  one  piece  of  a  big  puzzle  of  the  pipeline  system  in  North  America,  but  it   still  reflects  the  ever-changing  structure  of  the  global  oil  market  and  the  strategic  decisions   between  countries  in  North  America  regarding  national  energy  security.    At  first,  the  paper   will  try  to  provide  the  timeline  of  the  project  in  a  political  and  economic  context.

2.2  Historical  Political-Economic  Context  
"While  all  oil  and  gas  pipelines  perform  similar  physical  functions,  the  institutions  that   surround  them  are  stubbornly  dissimilar  from  country  to  country"  (Makholm,  2012,  p  x)   2.2.1  Oil  crisis  and  the  National  Energy  Program  (NEP)                           The  birth  of  Line  9  was  the  implementation  of  the  national-energy-security  strategy   begun  after  the  1973  Oil  Crisis,  which  was  directly  caused  by  the  oil  embargo  imposed  by   the  Organization  of  Arab  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OAPEC).  The  concern  over  the   vulnerability  of  eastern  Canadian  oil  refineries,  which  depended  heavily  on  overseas  crude   oil  imports,  led  the  government  of  Canada  to  enter  into  an  agreement  with  Interprovincial   Pipe  Line,  Ltd.  (IPL),  which  was  the  initial  name  of  Enbridge,  to  construct  an  extension   from  Sarnia  to  Montreal  in  order  to  transport  crude  oil  from  Alberta  to  eastern  refineries.     Through  this  20  year  agreement,  the  government  of  Canada  guaranteed  compensation  for   any  loss  that  resulted  from  possible  low  throughputs.    On  February  25,  1977,  an  additional   agreement  provided  an  option  for  the  Government  of  Canada  to  purchase  Line  9  (NEB,   2014,  Reasons  for  decision  OH-002-2013).                         Shocked  by  the  1973  embargo,  the  political-economic  atmosphere  in  Canada  for  the   crude  oil  market  in  the  70s  was  naturally  dominated  by  policies  leading  to  state   interventions  in  and  regulations  of  both  intranational  and  international  oil  trades.     However,  "in  1981,  the  six  largest  oil  companies  in  Canada  [were]  all  foreign  controlled   (mostly  by  America)"  and  foreign  owners  controlled  seventeen  of  the  largest  oil  and  gas   companies  in  Canada  by  sales  and  in  1979  "had  71.7%  of  the  total  sales  in  the  industry   equaling  over  $6  billion  dollars  (Canadian)  and  the  eight  Canadian  controlled  companies   had  18.7%  of  total  sales  equaling  just  $1.6  billion  (Canadian)"  (Getman,  1980;  162).   Understandably,  the  introduction  of  the  federal  government's  National  Energy  Program      10  

   (NEP)  in  1980  was  designed  to  increase  the  share  of  Canadian  ownership  of  the  energy   industry,  to  promote  oil  self-sufficiency  by  1990  and  to  provide  an  equitable  share  of  the   profits  from  energy  for  all  Canadians  (Getman,  1980). However,  Western  Canadians,   especially  in  Alberta,  had  a  different  idea  and  they  regarded  the  NEP  as  one  that   discriminated  against  them,  and  the  oil  and  gas  industry  regarded  the  NEP  "as  an   unnecessary  government  intrusion  into  their  business"  (Nemeth,  1998;  87).  With  the  help   of  oil  market  changes  (falling  price),  those  political  and  economic  powers  eventually   disabled  the  further  implementation  of  a  state-control  energy  policy.     2.2.2  The  Free  Trade  Agreement  (1989)  and  the  pro-market  energy  policy  shift                       It  was  the  Mulroney  majority  conservative  government  (which  won  election  in  1984)   that  started  to  realize  the  dramatic  shift  from  the  Trudeau  Liberal  state  control  policy  to  a   pro-market  energy  policy.  This  naturally  led  to  the  Canada-U.S.  Free  Trade  Agreement   (FTA)  1989,  which  required  that  Americans  did  not  need  to  pay  more  than  Canadians  for   oil.  On  May  1,  1997,  shortly  after  the  government  of  Canada  and  IPL  were  both  released   from  the  agreement  (On  June  4,  1996),  IPL  applied  to  the  NEB  to  reverse  the  direction  of   flow  in  Line  9  in  order  to  transport  crude  oil  to  major  refineries  in  Ontario  from  Montreal,   mainly  because  importing  crude  oil  was  more  cost  effective  for  Eastern  Canada  in  a  more   open  market  (NEB,  2014,  Reasons  for  Decision  OH-002-2013).   2.2.3  Environment  vs  energy                               However,  never-ending  environmental  incidents  and  disasters,  the  global  warming   issue  and  a  new  ideology  shift  to  sustainable  development  have  been  challenging  more  and   more  those  profit-centered  traditional  energy  super  powers.  "The  second  recent  historical   point  to  be  emphasized  centres  on  the  growing  interactions  between  energy  policy  and

   environmental  policy  [...]  with  the  political  emergence  of  the  environmental  movement  in   the  late  1960s,  the  linkages  between  energy  and  environment  have  intensified  and  have   also  become  both  more  complex  and  more  specific"  (Doern,  2005;  10).  Doern'  s  arguments   are  especially  strong  regarding  the  Line  9  Project.  The  increasing  number  of  intervenors  in   the  pipeline  approval  process  could  also  demonstrate  this  environmental  awareness.   Caron,  the  former  Chair  and  CEO  of  the  NEB,  mentioned  in  a  speech:  "It  wasn't  that  long   ago  when  most  people  in  Canada  had  no  idea  who  we  were.  When  we  reviewed  an   application  from  Trans  Mountain  Pipeline  for  its  Anchor  Loop  project  in  2006,  there  were   8  intervenors.  In  our  current  review  of  the  Trans  Mountain  Expansion  Project,  there  are   400  intervenors"  (Caron,  "Reflections  on  35  years",  2014).  After  the  1997  Kyoto  Protocol,   Prime  Minister  Chretien  announced  that  Canada  would  ratify  the  Kyoto  pact  by  the  end  of   2002,  in  addressing  mounting  environment  political  pressure  both  internationally  and   nationally  (Doern,  2005).  However,  the  Harper  Conservative  Government  has  been   changing  the  direction  of  the  dynamic  between  environment  and  energy  toward  an  even   more  pro-energy  development  strategy,  which  followed  the  Bush  government's  alternative   to  Kyoto  protocol  policy.  Harper  even  declared  Canada  "the  emerging  energy  superpower"   in  a  speech  at  London  in  2006  (Blanchfiel,  2006,  n.d.).  In  light  of  the  economic  crisis  and   uncertainty,  the  most  recent  C-38  Bill  is  the  most  effective  indicator  of  the  current  political   context.     2.2.4  C-38  Bill,  not  a  good  time  for  participants                               Bill  C-38  was  introduced  as  the  Jobs,  Growth  and  Long-term  Prosperity  Act  in  2012.   In  front  of  Parliament,  Shelly  Glover,  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  of  Finance,   said:  "At  times  like  these,  Canadian  families  want  their  government  and  elected  officials  to

Three                Main  Actors  
                      The  story  will  begin  with  an  analysis  of  the  actors  involved  in  the  decision-making   process.  It  will  start  with  NEB,  followed  by  the  applicant  and  intervenors.    

3.1  Actor  #1:  the  NEB

   two  other  members  to  hear  arguments  for  competing  applications  to  build  pipelines  to   transport  natural  gas  from  the  Artic  to  the  US  markets.  As  Crowe  had  been  working  for  the   Arctic  Gas  Pipeline  Limited  (Artic  Gas),  one  of  the  competitors  in  the  application,  before  he   joined  NEB,  five  of  the  intervenors  objected  to  his  participation  at  the  opening  of  the   hearing.  Then,  the  NEB  asked  the  Federal  Court  of  Appeals  if  the  Board  could  reject  the   objections  from  intervenors.  The  ruling  of  the  Federal  court  of  Appeals  supported  the   NEB's  request  not  to  remove  Mr.  Crowe  from  the  panel.    However,  the  Supreme  Court  of   Canada  reversed  the  ruling  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  on  the  ground  that  the  NEB,  with  a   quasi-judicial  nature,  should  apply  the  nemo  judex  rule  to  its  proceeding  (Jones,  1977).       Nemo  iudex  in  causa  sua  (or  nemo  iudex  in  sua  causa)  is  the  second  principle  of  natural   justice  that  no  person  can  judge  a  case  in  which  they  have  an  interest.  Jones  (1977,  p474)   argues  in  his  research  on  "attitudinal  bias":  "If  the  policy  underlying  the  nemo  judex  rule  is   indeed  the  preservation  of  the  public's  confidence  in  the  impartiality  of  adjudicative   agencies,  the  likelihood  of  actual  bias  is  irrelevant."      Jones  concluded:  "greater  awareness   by  the  government  of  possible  or  perceived  conflicts  of  interest  would  cause  it  to  exercise   greater  care  in  appointing  its  various  officers,  particularly  to  quasi-judicial  bodies"  (Jones,   1977;  484).    Unfortunately,  this  seems  often  the  opposite  in  reality.                           Besides  the  appointment  of  the  new  boss  of  the  NEB,  most  the  Board  members  have   work  experience  in  the  energy  private  sector,  which  could  give  them  an  advantage  in   becoming  a  member  and  also  the  likelihood  of  `attitudinal  bias'  at  the  same  time.  For   example,  the  newly  appointed  vice-chair,  Lyne  Mercier,  has  worked  at  Gaz  Metro  for  over   29  years  and  served  10  years  in  an  executive  position,  according  to  the  website  of  the  NEB   (Gaz  Metro  Inc.,  according  to  its  website,  is  "100%  owned  by  Noverco,  Inc.,  which  in  turn  is

                    Having  identified  the  actors  in  the  decision  process,  the  real  story  will  be  told  by   analyzing  the  interaction  among  those  actors  and  how  the  role  of  those  science-based   factors,  especially  probabilistic  risk  assessment,  influenced  the  outcome.  The  question   addressed  in  the  analysis  was  whether  the  decision  was  based  on  scientific  evidence,  on   the  strength  of  public  participation,  or  on  power  of  the  proponents  and  their  supporters.  In   a  quasi-judicial  tribunal  format,  similar  to  a  civic  court,  the  panel  formed  by  three  NEB   members  heard  from  competing  intervenors  with  competing  evidence  to  make  decisions   based  on  natural  justice  principles  in  the  Canadian  public  interest.    According  the   disposition  of  the  NEB's  reasons  for  the  decision  OH-002-2013  (2014,  p.  1),  the  Board  was   to  "rely  on  the  facts  that  are  established  to  its  satisfaction  through  the  hearing  process."   This  means  that  the  evidence  which  can  eventually  become  the  facts  that  the  NEB's   decisions  will  rely  on,  is  in  the  hands  of  the  three-member  panel.  Establishing  facts  lies  at   the  core  of  the  NEB  decision-making  process,  which  had  eventually  transformed  the  Line  9   decision-making  process  into  a  `fact  war'  among  all  the  actors.      The  interactions  among   applicants  and  intervenors  had  become  a  `fact  war'  between  a  more  solidified  S-Camp  and   a  loser  O-Camp,  which  had  been  striving  hard  to  impose  more  conditions  on  or  to   jeopardize  the  approval  of  the  NEB.      The  facts,  theoretically,  were  not  hard  to  find,  but  in   reality  establishing  the  key  facts  was  the  most  demanding  job.  The  first  and  most   important  fact  war  was  the  scope  battle.    

4.2  The  Scope  Battle  

              Defining  the  scope  of  the  project  was  the  most  crucial  step  of  the  Line  9  project   approval.  Without  exaggeration,  the  winner  of  this  scope  battle  would  win  the  whole  war,      30  

   because  the  whole  war  would  be  based  on  the  agenda  and  the  impact  area  that  had  been   designated.    The  scope  of  the  project,  which  entails  three  requests  from  Enbridge,  was   clearly  stated  in  the  NEB  document:                       On  29  November  2012,  Enbridge  filed  the  Application  detailing  its  request  1)  to  reverse   the  639  km  segment  of  Line  9  from  North  Westover,  Ontario  to  Montreal,  Quebec  (Line  9  B),   and  2)  to  increase  the  annual  capacity  of  the  entire  Line  9  from  240,00  bpd  to  approximately   300,000  bpd  through  the  introduction  of  a  drag  reducing  agent  (DRA),  while  maintaining    a   maximum  design  capacity  of  333,333  bpd,  pursuant  to  section  58  (Part  III)  of  the  NEB  Act.   The  Application  also  included  a  request  3)  to  revise  the  Line  9  Rules  and  Regulations  Tariff  to   allow  for  the  transportation  of  heavy  crude,  pursuant  to  Part  IV  of  the  NEB  Act."  (NEB,   Reasons  for  Decision  OH-002-2013;  4)                             In  order  to  achieve  the  three  targets,  modifying  existing  facilities  and  adding   additional  pumps  and  skids  and  so  on  were  needed.  This  logic  was  so  apparent  that   Enbridge's  application  stated:                             The  reversal  of  the  flow  of  Line  9B  will  be  achieved  mainly  by  modifying  existing   facilities.  The  increased  capacity  will  be  achieved  through  the  addition  of  pumps  and  skids   that  will  inject  Drag  Reducing  Agent  (DRA)  into  Line  9  at  existing  Enbridge  facilities.  With   the  exception  of  some  temporary  workspace  required  for  the  construction  of  a  new   densitometer  building  near  Enbridge's  North  Westover  Station,  the  Project  will  take  place   within  existing  Enbridge  properties  and  right  of  way  (ROW).  Project  work  at  Sarnia   Terminal,  North  Westover  Station,  Hilton  Station,  Cardinal  Station  (in  Ontario),  and   Terrebonne  Station  and  Montreal  Terminal  (in  Quebec)  includes  the  modification  or   replacement  of  exiting  equipment  and  the  installation  of  pumps  and  piping  within  the  facility

   boundaries  (Enbridge,  2012,  Line  9B  reversal  and  Line  9  capacity  expansion  project   application;18).                                 In  this  manner,  Enbridge  successfully  narrowed  down  the  scope  of  the  project  from   the  whole  Line  9  to  only  the  so-called  `physical  scope'  of  the  project:  modification,   replacement  and  new  installation.  It  literally  reversed  the  logic  of  the  application,  turning   the  scope  of  the  project  for  the  whole  Line  9  into  the  scope  of  those  few  limited  changes  to   the  existing  facilities  and  omitting  the  basic  fact  that  the  flow-direction  change  and   capacity  expansion  and  transport  of  heavy  crude  would  happen  along  the  whole  length  of   Line  9  and  potentially  affect  a  wide  impact  area,  not  only  in  the  `physical  scope'  of  new   changes.    By  winning  the  scope  battle,  the  benefit  to  Enbridge  was  huge  because  if  the   project  was  only  about  those  partial  modifications,  replacements  and  installations,   Enbridge  didn't  need  to  increase  the  insurance  coverage  to  deal  with  liabilities  for  the   whole  Line,  and  didn't  need  to  conduct  a  new  Environmental  Social-Economic  Impact   Assessment  for  the  existing  pipeline  parts.  This  logic  was  apparent  in  the  ruling  of  the   NEB:                   Based  on  the  nature  of  the  application,  the  Board  did  not  conduct  a  full  review  or  audit  of   the  current  and  on-going  operations  and  maintenance  (O  &  M)  work  along  Line  9,  Enbridge's   existing  integrity  management  program  (IMP),  nor  its  exiting  emergency  response  and   environmental  management  systems  (NEB,  2014,  Reasons  for  Decision  OH-00202013;  10).                   The  fallacy  of  the  logic  was  so  obvious,  even  one  of  the  NEB  members,  M.  Richmond,   expressed  his  suspicions  on  the  first  day  of  the  final  argument  hearing.  The  conversation   between  M.  Richmond  and  Mr.  Crowther,  the  council  for  Enbridge  was  far  more   interesting:    

  

32  

   Member  Richmond:  "Throughout  your  comments  today,  in  some  instances  when  you  talked   about  the  Project,  you  were  referring  exclusively  to  the--well  I  would  imagine  the   construction  site--construction  work  at  six  sites.  Other  times  you  talked  about  the  benefits  of   the  actions  being  taken  or  of  the  pipeline  as  a  whole  of  the  production  going  through  the   pipeline  and  source,  including  the  change  to  the  tariff  to  allow  heavy  crude,  which  of  course   doesn't  occur  at  six  sites"  (NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  1,  683).   Mr.  Crowther:  "The  Project--you're  quite  right,  I  think  that  information  requests  indeed-- perhaps  even  from  the  Board--focus  in  some  respects  on  the  physical  work  involved  and   define  the  project  in  that  way  "  (NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume1,   689).                           The  answer  Mr.  Crowther  gave  actually  revealed  another  fact:  Enbridge  could  not   achieve  this  reversal  of  logic  without  the  help  of  the  NEB  and  the  consensus  between   Enbridge  and  NEB  regarding  the  scope  of  the  project.    But  apparently  it  didn't  include   Member  Richmond  as  he  raised  this  crucial  question  and  needed  to  be  reminded  by  Mr.   Crowther.    This  consensus  likely  happened  in  the  early  stages  of  the  application  process.    If   we  go  back  to  the  timeline  of  the  Project,  we  will  find  that  on  October  11,  2012,  the  NEB   received  a  pre-application  information  filing  regarding  the  Line  9  project  and  one  and  half   months  later,  November  29,  2012,  Enbridge  filed  the  formal  application.    It  is  reasonable  to   assume  that  the  scope  of  the  project  was  in  the  conversation  or  communication  between   them  during  that  time  as  this  was  not  a  question  that  could  be  avoided.    From  the  O-Camp,   several  intervenors  had  pointed  out  this  scope  problem,  but  the  strongest  one  came  from   Mr.  Darko  Matovic,  from  the  Ontario  Pipeline  Probe:

                         In  conclusion,  we  submit  that  the  National  Energy  Board  could  issue  the  permit  to   Enbridge  for  the  works  at  the  particular  sites  for  which  it  seeks  the  permit  under  the  current   application  but  should  not  extend  the  scope  of  this  permission  to  include  the  approval  of  the   flow  reversal,  flow  capacity  increase  and  the  change  in  the  product  transported  to  the   pipeline  since  neither  Enbridge  asked  for  that  in  the  project  nor  it  provided  nearly  enough   engineering  detail  and  arguments  for  such  modification  for  use  in  the  pipeline  itself  (NEB,   OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  4,  2990).                 By  winning  the  scope  battle,  Enbridge  was  already  on  the  right  track  to  win  other   battles  because  some  things  would  be  beyond  the  scope  of  future  arguments.     4.2.1  Out  of  the  scope,  a  strong  excuse                               Out-of-the-scope  was  reasonably  used  by  Enbridge  and  the  NEB  in  the  proceedings  as   an  excuse  for  not  dealing  with  many  First  Nations  issues  and  big  scale  environmental   issues,  such  as  Greenhouse  Gasses.    We  see  this  in  the  speech  that  Mr.  Crowther  made   during  the  hearing  and  also  the  ruling  of  the  NEB  below:                     Mr.  Crowther:  "With  respect,  this  hearing  is  not  the  proper  forum  in  which  to  debate   these  issues.  The  courts  have  found  that  the  duty  to  consult  on  a  proposed  project  does  not   include  addressing  alleged  past  wrongs"  (NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,   Volume  1,  484).                     NEB:  "Some  concerns  were  raised  that  are  not  within  the  Board's  mandate  to  regulate,   such  as  oilsands  development,  energy  policy,  upstream  greenhouse  gasses  (GHGs)  and  GHGs   related  to  the  end  use  of  crude  oil"  (NEB,  2014,  Reasons  for  Decisions  OH-00202013;  2).   These  of  out-of-the-scope  arguments  are  supported  by  one  of  the  C.D.  HOWE  Institute's   reports:

                         I  argue  that  scope  creep  in  regulation  is  not  beneficial  for  the  process  (efficiency)  or  for   the  decision  (effectiveness).  It  is  simply  not  efficient  or  effective  to  attempt  to  solve  broad,  far- reaching  societal  challenges,  such  as  First  Nations  land  claims  or  greenhouse  gas  emissions   policy,  through  individual  project  reviews  (Doucet,  2012;  13).                         Unfortunately,  it  was  contrary  to  Doucet's    `scope  creep'  in  this  case.  By  deliberately   narrowing  down  the  scope  of  the  project,  the  real  consequences  of  the  project  would  be   not  adequately  addressed  in  the  proceedings.    

4.3  Information  Battles    

              The  second  important  fact  battle  was  an  information  battle.    How  many  documents  and     what  degree  of  information    should  Enbridge  reveal  to  the  public  or  intervenors?    Scrutiny   always  lies  on  the  front  line  of  this  kind  of  battle.    Enbridge  usually  used  two  reasons  to   refuse  the  information  requests  from  intervenors:  the  information  was  not  warranted  by   relevance  and  it  went  beyond  the  level  of  detail,  which  could  be  related  to  security  or   privacy  issues.    John  Goudy,  OPLA,  for  instance,  was  frustrated  after  the  OPLA's   information  request  to  Enbridge  for  an  updated  environmental  assessment  that  takes   account  of  inspections  conducted  in  the  past  two  years  was  refused  by  Enbridge.     Enbridge's  response  is  below:                                   Enbridge  objects  to  the  request  as  it  is  unduly  onerous  and  unreasonable.  The  time,   effort  and  expense  involved  in  the  compilation  of  the  requested  information  are  not   warranted  by  the  relevance,  if  any,  of  the  information  sought,  by  the  significance  of  the   information  in  the  context  of  the  proceeding,  or  by  the  probative  value  of  the  result   (Enbridge,  2013,  Exhibit  B19-1  Response  to  OPLA  No1-A3I6V0).  

  

35  

                   Similarly,  Enbridge  gave  the  same  response,  when  the  Ontario  Pipeline  Probe  had   made  a  reasonable  request  for  the  information  below:                   Details  about  all  the  spills  in  the  last  10  years,  that  include:  1  The  pipeline  age;  2  The   cause  of  spill;  3[the]  pipe  rupture  type  of  material;  4  Type  of  material  failure;  5  Cause  of   mechanical  failure;  6  History  of  checks  for  that  section;  7  Fluid  transported...  (NEB,  2013,   OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  4;  2983)                   These  kinds  of  `not  warranted  by  the  relevance'  responses  to  many  information   requests  from  intervenors  were  directly  related  to  the  scope  issue.  Since  the  Line  9   project's  scope  had  been  confined  to  limited  physical  alterations,  any  information  beyond   it  was  out  of  the  scope  and  deemed  irrelevant.     4.3.1  Summary  is  enough                     A  further  information  request  by  OPLA  was  for  a  copy  of  the  updated  Line  9A  Integrity   Engineering  Assessment  (EA)  and  was  objected  to  by  Enbridge  and  the  NEB.    In  the  NEB's   ruling  Number  4,  the  Board  ruled  that:                           The  requested  information  goes  beyond  the  level  of  detail  that  would  be  helpful  to  the   Board  in  this  proceeding.  The  summary  information  captured  in  Enbridge's  Engineering   Assessment  is  sufficient  (NEB,  2013,  Exhibit  A18-1:  Letter  to  OPLA  Ruling  No.4,  Adobe  p  3).                     The  summary  information  that  the  NEB  mentioned  was  basically  a  statement  of   conclusions  that  confirmed  the  EA  was  adequate,  but  it  seemed  that  the  NEB  judged  the   statements  to  be  satisfactory.    The  arguments  of  security  and  privacy  were  used  by   Enbridge  and  NEB  as  justifications  to  not  provide  the  requested  detailed  information  to   intervenors  or  the  public  for  their  scrutiny.

   4.3.2  Is  an  information  request  a  fishing  expedition?                       By  asking  for  detailed  information,  OPLA  was  accused  of  engaging  in  a  "fishing   expedition"  by  Enbridge.    John  Goudy  responded  in  the  hearing:                     No,  Enbridge  was  wrong.  OPLA  was  not  engaged  in  a  fishing  expedition.  OPLA  was   asking  for  the  analysis  to  back  up  Enbridge's  claim  that  everything  is  fine  with  Line  9A.  OPLA   was  not  satisfied  with  Enbridge's  position  that  we  aren't  going  to  provide  you  with  an   updated  engineering  assessment  but  trust  us,  we  looked  at  it  and  everything  is  fine  (NEB,   2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  6,  5206,  5207).                             The  examples  above  represent  only  a  small  number  of  these  kinds  of  information   battles  during  the  hearing.  Overall,  one  thing  that  had  became  clear  was  that  the  O-Camp   was  again  not  successful  in  this  information  battle.

                    Evidence  Battles,  the  third  kind  of  core  battle,  were  determined  by  what  kinds  of   information  or  research  could  become  true  evidence  that  could  carry  more  weight  in  the   NEB's  decisions.    The  research  by  Flyvbjerg  showed  that  it  was  power  that  determined   rationality  (Flyvbjerg,  1998).  In  this  case,  usually,  the  written  expert  evidence  tended  to   carry  far  more  weight  than  the  written  evidence  prepared  by  environmental  groups  or   other  associations  themselves.    Expert  evidence  arguments  were  more  likely  to  become   the  facts  that  the  NEB's  decisions  would  rely  upon.    This  was  also  why,  in  the  final  oral   argument,  Enbridge  had  focused  on  attacking  the  two  written  experts'  evidence  provided   by  the  project's  opponents:  the  Goodman  Group's  Analysis  and  the  Accufacts  Report.  The   two  written  expert  testimonies  were  both  prepared  by  the  Equiterre  Coalition,  which  was   the  only  true  challenges  to  Enbridge  in  the  NEB's  proceeding.    The  two  written  testimonies   had  consumed  a  substantial  amount  of  Enbridge's  resources  and  actually  did  carry  more      37  

   weight  in  the  decision-making  of  the  NEB  than  the  other  evidence  that  other  members  in   O-Camp  had  put  forward.     4.4.1  The  attacks  of  the  Goodman  Group's  analysis  and  the  Accufacts  Report                       Enbridge's  reply  to  the  two  written  expert  testimonies  was  prepared  by  Demke   Management  Ltd.,  a  Calgary-based  consultant  firm  focusing  on  economics,  management,   and  oil  &  gas  developments.    The  Goodman  Groups  is  a  successful,  California-based   consulting  firm  specializing  in  energy  and  regulatory  economics  and  regional  economic   development.  Its  clients  are  located  throughout  the  US  and  Canada.      The  Goodman  Group's   analysis  had  focused  on  the  socioeconomic  benefits  and  costs  of  the  reversal.    Economic   benefit  was  the  card  Enbridge  had  been  playing  all  through  the  hearing  and  in  the  pubic   meetings.    But  the  Goodman  Group's  analysis  directly  refuted  those  benefits  found  in   Enbridge's  expert  testimonies  and  the  testimonies  from  oil,  refinery  and  retail  companies.   Mr.  Crowther,  from  Enbridge,  opened  fire  on  the  Analysis  on  the  hearing  with  a  sentence:   "With  respect,  The  Goodman  Group  analysis  suffers  from  a  number  of  critical   deficiencies...  "(NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  1;  267,).  The   Accufacts  report  was  prepared  by  Accufacts  Inc.,  a  20  year  old,  Washington-based,  public- record-research  Corporation.    The  report  targeted  Enbridge's  most  controversial  element:   Line  9's  risk  of  rupture  and  issues  around  integrity  management.  However,  Enbridge   fought  back  during  the  hearing:                           We  alluded  briefly  to  the  Accufacts  Report  earlier.  It  is  necessary  now  to  address  it  at   some  length  since  it  includes,  among  others,  assertions  of  serious  deficiencies  affecting   Enbridge's  pipeline  integrity  management...It  may  be  that  the  use  of  such  overblown  rhetoric   was  intended  to  incite  public  sentiment  against  the  Project.  Regardless,  it  is  completely

   unhelpful  to  this  process  and  most  especially  because  it  has  no  basis  in  fact...  (NEB,  2013,  OH- 002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  1;  342,345)                                     The  attacks  from  Enbridge  on  the  Goodman  Group's  analysis  and  the  Accufacts   report  had  successfully  focused  on  sentimental,  unprofessional  arguments  in  order  to   degrade  the  credibility  of  the  whole  research.  For  example,  Mr.  Crowther  pointed  out:   "Indeed,  the  Accufacts  Report  goes  so  far  to  include  a  subheading  that  blares:  `Something   appears  very  wrong  with  Enbridge's  Line  9B  risk  assessment'"  (NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013   Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  1;  344).  The  blocking  of  the  detailed  information  revelations   (information  battles)  had  been  greatly  damaging  to  the  quality  of  any  independent   research  even  before  it  started.    Also,  the  lack  of  resources,  funding  and  expert  support   also  limited  an  equal  production  of  the  same  level  of  expert  evidence.       4.4.2  Evidence  battles  outside  the  hearing                       Evidence  battles  also  occurred  outside  the  hearing.  The  headache  of  facing  polarized,   confusing  information  and  evidence,  was  not  only  experienced  by  the  members  of  the  NEB,   but  also  by  those  landowners  and  residents  who  will  be  living  alongside  Line  9.    For   example,  according  the  report  by  Baker  (2014,  March  20),  about  a  hundred  landowners   attended  a  video  conference  with  Richard  Kuprewicz,  an  engineer  and  president  of   Accufacts  Inc.,  at  the  Cornwall  Civic  Complex  on  March  20,  2014,  in  order  to  seek  "neutral   information"  not  originating  from  the  two  polarized  sides:  Enbridge  and  the   Environmental  groups.  Neutral  information  was  something  that  could  more  likely  become   facts  to  those  landowners.    However,  it  was  hard  to  find  neutral  information  in  reality.  The   people  in  the  S-Camp  must  have  regarded  Mr.  Kuprewicz  as  belonging  in  the  O-Camp  as  his

   company  had  prepared  the  most  useful  report  for  the  Equiterre  Coalition  (See  evidence   battles).  The  evidence  battles  would  eventually  push  any  involved  expert  to  pick  a  side.    

4.5  Protests  and  Appeal  
                      The  protests  that  happened  along  with  the  hearing  were  usually  outside  the  NEB's   Court.    However,  in  October,  2013,  a  group  of  anti-pipeline  protesters  stormed  into  the   hearing  proceeding  at  the  Metro  Toronto  Convention  Centre  and  pushed  the  NEB  to   postpone  the  hearing.    The  NEB  expressed  its  frustration  in  its  document:                   The  Board  expects  Participants  and  other  members  of  the  public  attending  its  hearings  to   act  with  courtesy  and  respect  during  the  proceeding.  Unfortunately,  this  was  not  always  the   case.  The  Board  takes  seriously  the  unfortunate  instances  during  which  Parties  were   interrupted  by  individuals  attending  the  hearing  at  both  venues.  Ultimately,  this  lack  of   decorum  and  disruptive  conduct  resulted  in  the  final  day  of  oral  argument  being  cancelled,   due  to  concerns  with  respect  to  the  security  of  attendees  (NEB,  2014,  Reasons  for  Decision   OH-00202013,  p.13).                               After  that,  the  NEB  made  its  final  decision,  according  to  news  in  The  First   Perspective,  "The  Chippewas  of  the  Thames  First  Nation  filed  for  a  leave  to  appeal  federal   regulator's  green  light  to  reverse  and  increase  flow  on  Enbridge's  aging  Line  9"   (McDiarmid,  2014,  online  n.d.).    

4.6  Is  the  Public  Participation  a  "Mere  Lip  Service"?  
                  Public  participation  has  been  widely  implemented  in  many  regulatory  decision- making  practices  for  many  years,  and  it  is  listed  first  on  the  NEB's  reasons  for  its  decision   on  the  Project.  The  chapter  opened  with:  "Effective  public  participation  facilitates   understanding  between  stakeholders,  improves  decisions  and  acknowledges  the  desire  of  

  

40  

   interested  persons  to  participate  in  decisions  which  affect  them"  (NEB,  2014,  Reasons  for   Decision  OH-00202013,  p13).    Despite  this,  throughout  the  hearing,  many  participants  had   expressed  frustrations  about  the  public  participation  and  engagement  process  including   rushed  notices,  not  being  informed  or  being  ill-informed,  and  meetings  being  hosted  after   passing  the  participation  deadline.  It  might  have  become  a  public  disengagement  program   in  terms  of  its  effectiveness.  An  individual  intervenor  had  even  conducted  a  survey  of   Burlington  residents  and  political  scientists  to  prove  it.    A  lawyer  from  the  First  Nation   Mohawk  Council  of  Kahnawa:ke  (MCK)  called  those  public  engagement  programs  "mere   lip  service"  (NEB,  2014,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  2;1326).  However,  The   Board  expressed  a  different  `third-party'  view  about  the  participation  program:   improvement  was  needed  but  it  was  adequate.    

4.7  Did  Science-based  Factors  Play  A  Role?    

                          In  the  NEB's  Line  9  Project  decision-making  process,  there  were  very  important  key   science-based  measurements,  which  could  indicate  if  the  pipeline's  engineering,  safety  and   environmental  standards  would  be  actually  met.  Based  on  the  analysis,  not  surprisingly,   this  research  found  that  even  some  of  the  most  basic  science-based  and  technical   measures  had  different  versions  depending  on  which  camps  they  came  from.  Enbridge  had   been  apparently  reducing  the  risk  by  narrowing  down  the  scope  and  increasing  the   economic  benefits  of  the  project.  The  environmental  groups  had  faced  serious  information   blockages,  which  greatly  increased  suspicions  about  everything  Enbridge  had  said.    They   had  been  trying  very  hard  to  probe,  to  falsify,  and  even  to  guess  what  was  really  happening   to  the  Enbridge's  pipeline  underground.    It  even  reached  the  point  where  the  more  crucial   the  science-based  factors  were,  the  more  disputed  they  were  because  those  factors  were  

  

41  

   the  key  measurements  for  the  approval  of  the  Line  9  project.    In  the  end,  the  role  those   science-based  factors  played  fell  on  the  judgments  and  expertise  of  the  NEB.  In  terms  of   science-based  factors,  this  paper  will  only  focus  on  the  most  important  components,  like   the  Environmental  Assessment,  the  Pipeline  Risk  Assessment,  the  Pipeline  Integrity   Engineering  Assessment  and  some  of  most  disputed  technical  issues  in  the  hearing,  such  as   Hydrostatic  Testing.  As  those  science-based  factors  are  beyond  the  expertise  of  the   researcher,  what  the  paper  investigates  is  only  how  those  technical  factors  had  been   presented  by  those  actors.  However,  problems  embedded  in  those  factors  were  shockingly   obvious  and  serious.     4.7.1  No  Environmental  and  Socio-economic  Assessment  (ESA)  needed                         The  NEB's  ruling  that  no  further  assessment  for  ESA  was  necessary  was  not   surprising  because  Enbridge  had  won  the  scope  battle.  In  this  narrow  scope  logic,  it  would   be:  "Where  there  were  no  potential  Project-environment  interactions,  or  where  the   potential  interaction  would  be  positive  or  neutral"  (NEB,  2014,  Reasons  for  Decision  OH- 00202013;  74).  Then  many  participants'  concerns  about  the  environment  and  community   safety  were  easily  and  reasonably  blocked  by  the  fact  that  this  was  an  existing  pipeline,  not   a  new  project.  If  this  is  the  case,  what  about  Enbridge's  planned  600  and  more  excavations   for  Line  9  (more  digs  are  expected  in  the  future);  Would  there  still  be  no  project- environment  interaction  (See  Future  tense)?   4.7.2  The  Risk  Assessment  changes                   The  Pipeline  Integrity  Engineering  Assessment,  along  with  the  Pipeline  Risk   Assessment,  were  the  most  important  crucial  science-based  tools  among  the  science-based   measurements,  because  they  could  address  directly  the  largest  safety  issues  about  this  38

   year  old,  30-inch  pipeline.    Enbridge's  the  Pipeline  Risk  Assessment  of  Line  9B  Reversal  and   Line  9  Capacity  Expansion  Project  appeared  in  the  form  of  the  Appendix  B  to  the  Pipeline   9B  Engineering  Assessment.    The  Pipeline  Integrity  Engineering  Assessment  9B  was   prepared  by  the  Pipeline  Integrity  Department  of  Enbridge,  dated  November  2012,  which   was  just  before  the  application  of  the  Project.    The  conclusion  of  the  pipeline  Risk   Assessment  is  found  below:                         In  summary,  the  Line  9B  reversal  portion  of  the  project  will  result  in  minor  increases  of   risk  to  the  operation  of  the  pipeline  at  the  discharge  side  of  the  pump  stations  (North   Westover,  Hilton,  Cardinal  and  Terrebonne).  The  reversal  of  Line  9B  will  result  in  minor   decreases  of  risk  to  the  operation  of  the  pipeline  at  the  suction  side  of  the  pump  stations   (Hilton,  Cardinal,  Terrebonne  and  Montreal).  An  increase  in  risk  will  be  realized  for   approximately  0.9%  of  Line  9  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  capacity  expansion  portion  of  the   Project  (Enbridge,  2013,  The  Pipeline  Risk  Assessment  Line,  P9).                     However,  during  the  hearing,  a  revised  Pipeline  Risk  Assessment  from  Enbridge   aligned  with  its  recent  new  In-Line-Inspections  (ILIs)  testing  data  in  9B  was  presented,   and  suddenly  the  risk  section  percentage  increased  from  0.9%  to  2.2%,  almost  2.5  times   higher  than  before.  More  importantly,  there  was  not  an  event  probability  provided  in  those   risk  sections.  But  it  was  still  fairly  safe  according  to  Enbrdge:               Enbridge:    "The  project  would  increase  Line  9's  capacity.  And  that  increase  would  result  in   an  increase  in  assessed  risk  for  2.2  percent  of  the  pipeline.  To  be  clear,  that  does  not  mean  a   2.2  percent  of  the  pipeline  higher  risk  overall.  In  fact,  only  60  of  the  2,730  total  305-  meter   long  pipeline  sections  between  Montreal  Terminal  and  North  Westover  Station  display  an   increase  in  risk"(NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  1;  329).

                     As  we  see,  the  number  in  the  Risk  Assessment  can  be  changed  easily  and  the  Board   still  approved  the  project.  The  judgment  of  Risk  acceptability  was  in  the  control  of  the  NEB.     A  public  acceptance  of  the  risk  was  not  established.  But  the  larger  surprise  came  from  the   pipeline  Integrity  Assessment.       4.7.3  Future  tense,  the  updated  Pipeline  Engineering  Assessment                           In  the  completed  Pipeline  Integrity  Engineering  Assessment  (Enbridge,  2012),  there   were  planned  activities  prior  to  flow  reversal,  which  were  listed  on  Item  5,  just  before  the   conclusion:                           [To]  conduct  a  comprehensive  ILI  program  targeting  metal  loss,  cracking  and   geotechnical  features  between  ML  and  NW;  evaluate  the  results  of  the  ILI  program  and  re- assess  pipeline  integrity  based  on  2012-2013  inspection  data;  determine  what  line   rehabilitation  activities  are  required  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the  pipeline;  and  execute   required  excavations  and  rehabilitate  the  pipeline  to  maintain  pipeline  integrity  and  meet   the  required  operating  parameters  as  per  the  Enbridge  Integrity  Management  Plan   (Enbridge,  2013,  the  Pipeline  Integrity  Engineering  Assessment,  p.94).                         However,  this  unfinished  work  didn't  prevent  the  report  from  coming  to  the   conclusion  at  the  next  Item  6:  "The  overall  results  of  this  EA  thereby  demonstrate  that  the   Project  can  proceed  in  a  safe  and  reliable  operating  condition"  (Enbridge,  2013,  the   Pipeline  Integrity  Engineering  Assessment,  p95).    It  is  not  clear  how  Enbridge,  supported   merely  by  unfinished  data,  jumped  to  this  conclusion,  and  how  Enbridge  could  easily   change  a  number  in  the  risk  assessment  so  dramatically.    How  could  affected  populations   believe  the  conclusion  in  the  Enbridge  assessment  was  reliable?    More  surprisingly,  the

   completion  date  of  this  on-going  pipeline  test  described  during  the  hearing  was  in  the   future,  and  it  would  continue  after  the  NEB's  approval  of  the  project.                               Moreover,  according  to  the  NEB,  Enbridge  had  planned  over  600  excavations  for   Line  9,  which  related  to  verification  digging  and  repairing.    Participants  might  expect  that   these  excavation  numbers  related  to  `rehabilitation  activities'  would  rise  after  the  approval,   because  Enbridge  was  still  testing  its  pipeline.  But  future  works  would  not  be  under  public   scrutiny.  Those  significant  `rehabilitation  activities'  definitely  exceeded  normal   maintenance  repairs,  going  far  beyond  the  application  scope  that  Enbridge  and  the  NEB   had  defined.  But  the  biggest  drama  belongs  to  the  NEB's  approval  of  the  Project  in  light  of   those  strategic  maneuvers  by  Enbridge.       4.7.4  No  third  party  review  necessary                               Enbridge's  maneuver  of  suddenly  increasing  the  risk  value  had  aroused  the   suspicions  of  the  Ontario  Ministry  of  Energy  (OME),  which  decided  to  support  the  Ontario   Pipeline  Landowners  Association  (OPLA)  to  request  an  independent  third-party  review  of   Enbridge's  Updated  Engineering  Assessment  (Updated  EA),  including  the  Risk  Assessment.   These  suspicions  were  raised  about  both  Enbridge  and  the  NEB,  because  the  OME  should   have  known  that  the  NEB  had  experts  to  conduct  the  review.  Not  surprisingly,  the  NEB's   ruling  is  below:                       The  Board  is  an  independent,  expert  agency  with  technical  expertise  to  provide   oversight  over  a  wide  variety  of  pipeline  design  and  operation...The  NEB  staff  are  fully   qualified  to  support  the  Board  in  carrying  out  its  mandate,  and  the  Board  has  the  technical   expertise  to  conduct  a  review  of  Enbridge's  Updated  EA,  as  required  by  Condition  9  (NEB,   2014,  Reasons  for  Decision  OH-00202013;  50).

                             The  message  from  the  NEB  was  very  clear:  Don't  worry,  everything  is  under  the   NEB's  control  and  trust  us.  The  question  was  whether  the  board's  specialists  should  have   been  reviewing  Enbridge's  first  assessment  and  the  revised  version  of  the  assessment   before  the  approval  of  the  project  since  safety  is  the  top  priority  of  the  NEB.  However,  the   oversight  actions  of  NEB  experts  were  not  explained.     4.7.5  Hydrostatic  Testing  or  In-Line  Inspection?                         The  key  dispute  focused  on  which  technical  method  should  be  used  to  examine  the   pipeline's  current  condition,  Hydrostatic  Testing  or  In-Line  Inspection;  it  had  been   creating  a  lot  of  heat  for  the  participants,  and  even  among  the  public.    Enbridge's  choice   was  In-Line  Inspections  and  the  reason  was  explained  below:                         Hydrostatic  testing  is  not  a  panacea.  In  fact,  it  is  not  the  primary  method  utilized  by   pipeline  operators  that  are  able  to  use  high-resolution  In-Line  Inspection  tools  for  integrity   verification.  One  reason  is  that  hydrostatic  testing  only  provides  confirmation  at  a  particular   time  that  the  remaining  defects  in  the  pipeline  have  dimensions  smaller  than  a  critical  defect   size.  The  reality  is  that  a  successful  hydrostatic  test  does  not  guarantee  that  the  pipeline  in   question  will  not  fail  in  the  future  (NEB,  2013,  OH-002-2013  Hearing  Transcript,  Volume  1;   355,356).                     However,  the  first  recommendation  from  the  Accufacts  Report    (Equiterre   commissioned)  was  the  recommendation  that  Enbridge  conduct  a  hydrotest  before  the   reversal  operation.    In  the  report,  it  further  stated:                     Based  on  the  preponderance  of  information  from  the  NTSB  investigation,  Accufacts  finds   that  Enbridge  has  a  culture  of  denial  when  it  comes  to  the  strengths  of  hydrotesting  and  a   highly  distorted  over-reliance  on  ILI  inspection  on  crack  detection  that  has  yet  to  be

   sufficiently  proven  to  assure  pipeline  integrity  for  certain  extensive  SCC  and/or  corrosion   fatigue  cracking  threats  on  Line  9.  Accufacts  finds  Enbridge's  statements  concerning  the   possible  damage  from  hydrotesting  are  without  technical  merit,  and  appear  to  be  attempts  to   misinform  decision  makers  and  the  public  (Accufacts  Inc,  2013,  Report  on  Pipeline  Safety   for  Enbridge's  Line  9B  Application  to  NEB;  30).                         The  NEB's  decision  was  that  Enbridge  could  continue  to  proceed  with  ILI  but  to  leave   the  door  open  for  requiring  hydrotesting  later  on  before  granting  Enbridge  the  Leave  To   Open  (LTO),  in  consideration  of  the  Updated  EA,  new  repairing  conditions  and  ILI  tool   reliability.  This  has  become  a  normal  business  practice  between  the  NEB  and  Enbridge.     However,  the  challenges  would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  Accufacts  and  the   Equiterre.

Five            Key  Factors  
5.1  Introduction  
                Up  to  this  point,  the  paper  has  tried  to  tell  the  story  of  the  Line  9  Project's  approval   process  by  presenting  the  timeline  and  analyzing  the  actors  and  the  interactions  among   actors  based  on  the  evidence  that  has  been  recorded  in  the  hearing  transcripts,  the  filings,   the  written  evidence,  the  regulations,  the  reports,  and  other  sources  of  information,  such   as  newspapers,  and  websites.  Going  forward,  based  on  prior  analysis,  the  paper  will   provide  an  analysis  of  the  factors  that  had  influenced  the  NEB  ruling  in  order  to  further   understand  the  true  nature  of  this  decision-making  process.  The  paper  will  focus  on  the   key  factors  that  have  been  demonstrated  in  the  previous  analysis.                         The  conflict-centered  approach  naturally  led  the  investigation  to  the  power  analysis   that  Foucauldians  have  applied  for  many  years.  Such  researchers,  as  they  relate  to   theoretical  findings  in  the  planning  literature,  include:  Flyvbjerg  (1998),  Yiftachel,  et  al.   (2001)  and  Taylor,  Kim  &  Gahbauer,  (2009).  In  the  prior  analysis,  the  paper  found  that  the   two  camps  both  had  been  wielding  their  power  to  present  rationalization  as  rationality,   even  though  the  power  between  them  was  asymmetrical.  This  finding  reinforces   Flyvbjerg's  finding  that    "Rationalization  presented  as  rationality  is  shown  to  be  a  principal   strategy  in  the  exercise  of  power"  (Flyvbjerb,  1998;  2).  Further,  the  NEB's  decision-making   process  mainly  turned  into  a  competition  of  rationalizations.  The  rationalizations  of  the   two  camps  were  evident  in  the  scope  battle,  information  battles,  and  evidence  battles.   Given  the  conflicting  roles  embedded  in  the  establishment  of  the  NEB,  the  Board  also   needed  a  rationalization  to  dress  up  its  decision  as  a  more  rational  one.  In  this  `fact'   establishing  process,  true  facts  and  false  facts  (products  of  the  rationalization)  would  have  

  

48  

   both  been  established.  However,  to  what  extent  the  rationalization  can  be  realized  in  this   quasi-independent,  quasi-judicial  tribunal  authority  is  the  most  crucial  question.      

5.2  Key  factor  1:    Three-Member  Panel    
                        Among  the  current  setting  of  the  NEB,  in  this  paper's  power  analysis  perspective,  the   Three-Member  Panel  is  the  key  factor  influencing  the  decision.    How  these  three  members   exercised  their  power,  depended  largely  on  their  backgrounds  and  expertise.    In  order  to   probe  this  panel,  a  background  check  is  necessary.  Three  members  in  the  panel  of  this   Project  include  L.  Mercier  (Chairperson),  M.  Richmond  and  J.  Gauthier.    In  order  to  invite   reader  to  become  involved  in  the  analysis,  the  paper  lists  their  original  profiles  posted  on   the  NEB's  website  below:   Lyne  Mercier:                     Ms.  Mercier  was  designated  as  Vice-Chair  and  Alternate  CEO  of  the  National  Energy   Board  of  Canada  (Board)  On  June  12,  2014.  [After  the  ruling  of  the  Line  9  Project])  Her  term   is  for  a  period  of  seven  years,  on  a  full-time  basis.  Ms.  Mercier  was  first  appointed  as  a   permanent,  full-time  member  of  the  NEB  on  December  17,  2008,  for  a  term  of  seven  years.   Before  joining  the  NEB,  Ms.  Mercier  worked  at  Gaz  Metro  for  over  29  years,  serving  10  year  in   executive  positions.  At  Gaz  Metro  she  was  director  of  the  gas  supply  division,  where  she  was   responsible  for  strategic  policy  for  natural  gas  supply  and  for  the  management  of  natural  gas   transmission,  storage  and  supply  contracts.  Prior  to  that,  She  was  head  of  the  pricing   division,  where  she  was  responsible  for  toll  design  and  cost-of-service  allocation  studies.  Ms.   Mercier  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Commerce  from  St.  Mary's  University  and  an  Executive  MBA  from   I'Ecole  des  Hautes  Etudes  Commerciales  (NEB,  "Board  Members",  online,  n.d.).     Mike  Richmond:

                         Mr.  Richmond  was  appointed  as  a  temporary  member  of  the  NEB  on  November,  1,   2012.  His  term  is  for  a  period  of  three  years,  on  a  part-time  basis.  Mr.  Richmond  holds  a  law   degree  from  the  university  of  Toronto  and  a  Bachelor  of  Social  Science  degree  from  the   University  of  Ottawa.  Originally  from  Montreal,  Quebec,  Mr.  Richmond  practices  law  in   Toronto,  Ontario  at  McMillan  LLP,  where  he  is  co-Chair  of  the  Energy  and  Power  Group.  As  an   energy  lawyer,  Mr.  Richmond  has  extensive  experience  in  electricity,  renewables  and  utilities.   From  2001  to  2001,  Mr.  Richmond  served  the  Government  of  Ontario  as  a  Senior  Energy   Policy  Advisor  during  the  restructuring  of  Ontario's  electricity  markets.  In  addition,  Mr.   Richmond  has  served  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Toronto  Hydro  Corporation,  Canada's   largest  municipal  electric  utility,  and  on  the  Board  of  the  Ontario  Energy  Association.  In   recent  years,  he  has  served  as  a  guest  lecturer  on  energy  policy  at  Queen's  University  (NEB,   "Board  Members",  online,  n.d.).   Jacques  Gauthier:                     Jacques  Gauthier  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Law  degree  from  the  University  de  Sherbrooke  and   is  a  member  of  the  Bar  of  the  province  of  Quebec.  Mr.  Gauthier  was  appointed  on  a  three  year   term  as  a  temporary  member  of  the  National  Energy  Board  effective  13  December  2012.  Mr.   Gauthier's  most  recent  position  before  joining  the  Board  was  serving  as  the  President  and   Chief  Executive  Officer  of  LVM  Inc.  and  Senior  Vice  President  of  Dessau  Inc.  Throughout  his   career,  Mr.  Gauthier  has  contributed  to  the  creation  and  development  of  major  energy   projects  in  both  Canada  and  the  United  States.  In  addition,  he  has  held  the  position  of   President  and  CEO  of  one  of  Canada's  largest  private  electricity  producers  and  North   American  Leader  in  wood  residue  power  generation.  He  has  served  on  a  wide  variety  of   boards  and  committees,  including  the  Canadian  Olympic  Committee,  the  Quebec  Wildlife

   Foundation,  and  the  Prime  Minister's  Advisory  Committee  on  the  Public  Service.  In  2012,  Mr.   Gauthier  was  the  personal  envoy  to  the  prime  minister  of  Canada  for  official  languages  and   president  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Official  Languages  for  the  Vancouver  2010  Olympic   Games.  Mr.  Gauthier  is  passionate  about  Official  Languages,  a  guest  speaker  at  numerous   Quebec  business  and  energy  industry  forums,  and  sits  as  a  judge  on  the  federal  penitentiaries   disciplinary  court.  In  2012  Mr.  Gauthier  received  the  Mercuriades  Award  in  recognition  of   excellence  in  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  (NEB,  "Board  Members",  online,  n.d.).                           From  the  above,  we  learned  that  two  of  the  three  members  excluding  Mr.  Richmond,   came  directly  from  the  energy  industry  and  had  been  in  very  high  positions  (especially  Mr.   Gauthier)  in  the  companies  they  served.    As  the  paper  mentioned  before,  Enbridge   indirectly,  partially  owned  Gaz  Metro  that  Ms.  Mercier  worked  for.    These  two  people  were   clearly  insiders  in  the  Energy  sector  and  Mr.  Gauthier  even  enjoyed  wide  social  ties  with   the  Canadian  energy  sector,  government  and  even  political  leaders.                           Based  on  the  hearing  transcript,  the  first  question  that  Mr.  Gauthier  asked  was  about   language,  some  issues  with  Enbridge's  French  version  filing.  This  reflected  his  passion  for   Official  language  issues  in  the  profile.    Mr.  Richmond  was  the  only  Member  who  had   challenged  Enbridge  and  its  allies  by  asking  key  questions,  for  example  the  scope  question.   Two  Members  held  law  degrees  and  one  with  a  commerce  and  MBA  degree.  None  of  the   panel  members  had  any  competence  in  risk  assessment,  environmental  assessment  or   physical  environmental  science.  In  terms  of  the  decision,  the  discussions  and  voting  among   the  three  members  were  held  behind  closed  doors.    But  based  on  the  final  decision,  it  was   not  hard  to  tell  that  Enbridge  had  very  strong  support  on  the  Panel.

                    Another  key  factor  is  information  transparency.    Information  inside  Enbridge  and  the   NEB  can  become  public  information  through  free  and  timely  information  flow.  In  this  case,   opponent  intervenors  desperately  wanted  to  increase  the  information  flow  by  filing  many   information  requests  to  Enbridge.    But  Enbridge  decreased  the  information  flow  by   refusing  many  requests  and  even  blaming  some  intervenors  for  engaging  in  `fishing   expeditions.'  Whoever  controled  the  information  flow  had  more  power  to  exercise   rationalization.  (Forester,  1989)  The  Information  control  itself  was  one  type  of  power   relation,  as  interest  groups  tended  to  keep  secret  the  information  that  opponents  could   utilize  and  revealed  the  information  that  could  be  used  to  advance  their  interest.                             The  NEB  could  also  control  the  information  flow  by  limiting  the  scope  and  details  of   publicly  accessible  information  or  by  objecting  to  information  requests  from  Interveners.     There  are  also  a  number  of  aspects  of  how  the  NEB  works  that  remain  opaque,  especially   aspects  related  to  how  they  audit  the  construction  and  operation  of  pipelines.  The  public   participation  and  engagement  program  in  this  case  did  not  offer  much  help  in  maintaining   information  transparency.    

5.4  Key  Factor  3:  Expert  Resources  

                        Expert  resources  also  were  a  decisive  factor  in  influencing  the  decision-making   process.  The  apparent  imbalance  of  expert  resources  between  two  camps  had  been   demonstrated  during  the  hearing  in  many  ways.    Among  the  many  environmental  and   citizen  groups,  the  lack  of  expert  resources  was  the  biggest  challenge  in  protecting  their   interests.  Most  intervenor  groups  relied  on  a  few  members  who  happened  to  be  engineers   to  volunteer  their  expertise,  and  often  they  lacked  financial  resources  to  commission  the   more  respected  experts  or  consultant  firms  to  provide  written  expert  evidence.  However,      52  

   there  was  only  one  organization,  Equiterre  Coalition,  that  could  commission  an  American   company  to  write  a  report  specific  to  this  hearing.  The  attack  from  Enbridge  on  these  two   written  expert  testimonies  (see  evidence  battles),  the  Goodman  Group's  analysis  and  the   Accufacts  report,  demonstrated  the  power  of  the  two  expert  documents.  Their  power   could  also  be  observed  in  the  NEB's  `Reasons  for  Decision'  document,  as  it  cited  the   evidence  in  the  Accufacts  Report  many  times  to  support  its  decision.  From  the  paper's   view,  the  Equiterre  Coalition  was  the  most  advanced  player  among  the  O-Camp  members.   It  was  the  only  group  that  had  exercised  the  most  powerful  weapon,  expert  evidence,  to   challenge  Enbridge.                         Unlike  opponent  groups,  Enbridge  had  many  full-time  experts  inside  the  company   and  never  hesitated  to  hire  outside  consultants  firms  when  needed.    The  number  in  the   pipeline  risk  assessment  could  be  changed  very  easily  by  its  staff.      The  industry  itself  has   been  cultivating  many  experts  and  successful  work  experience  in  the  industry  was  the   most  preferred  criterion  for  choosing  a  member  of  the  NEB.  This  gave  Enbridge  a  natural   advantage.    Moreover,  Enbridge  and  its  allies  are  the  big  consumers  for  both  energy   industry-related  new  technology  or  consultant  firm  services.  The  experts  in  those  firms   would  reasonably  be  reluctant  to  work  for  environmental  groups  for  fear  of  irritating  their   biggest  clients.    The  specialists  in  the  NEB  also  came  from  the  industry  or  related   engineering  technology  companies.    Once  they  find  positions  in  Government,  they  will   gradually  lose  the  edge  of  their  expertise.    All  of  these  factors  would  give  the  advantage  to   Enbridge  to  win  any  expert  war.  However,  the  example  of  the  Equiterre  Coalition  has   raised  the  hope  of  joining  together  to  form  a  coalition  in  order  to  gather  more  expert   resources  or  more  financial  sources  to  commission  expert  reports,  even  research.

5.5  Key  factor  4:  Tighter  Coalitions  Create  Power  
                                In  any  society,  common  sense  tells  us  that  more  alliances  result  in  more  power.     From  the  study,  it  was  very  clear  that  Enbridge  and  it  supporters  had  formed  very   cohesive  coalitions.  They  came  up  with  well-prepared  evidence  that  supported  each   other's  interests  closely.  This  indicated  that  the  communications  among  them  were   effective.  As  a  example,  the  Alberta  department  of  Energy  felt  no  need  to  make  comments   during  the  hearing  process.  However,  it  was  another  story  in  the  O-Camp.    The   governments,  social  groups  and  individuals  didn't  form  any  type  of  united  coalition,  even   though  they  all  opposed  the  approval  with  such  limited  conditions.    Their  interests  were   loosely  associated  with  the  same  concerns:  the  safety  of  the  community  or  the   environment.  Most  of  the  governments  did  not  object  to  the  approval  of  the  project,  but   would  have  liked  to  impose  more  strict  conditions  to  ensure  safety.  The  only  coalition  was   the  Equiterre  Coalition,  which  only  included  six  groups.  It  is  very  difficult  to  form  a   coalition  among  different  types  of  associations  inside  the  O-camp  because  an  alliance   needs  strong  leadership  and  commitment  to  unite  such  diverse  interest  groups.    Even  so,  a   coalition  may  be  the  only  hope  for  environmental  groups  and  landowner  groups  to  gather   more  power  in  future  battles.    Sager  responded  to  the  no-strategy-against-power   argument  by  suggesting  an  actual  role  for  planners  the  builds  "an  alliance  with  activist   organizations  external  to  the  planning  process  and  encourage  them  to  put  pressure  on   stakeholders  that  act  self-serving  at  the  expense  of  broader  interests"  (Sager,  2013,  p.  xix)

Six                  Conclusions  
This  paper  has  reviewed  the  record  of  the  NEB  hearings  and  told  the  story  of  the   Line  9  project  approval  through  a  timeline,  historical  context,  analyzing  main  actors,   analyzing  interactions  among  main  actors,  analyzing  how  science-based  factors  played  a   role,  and  finally  analyzing  some  key  factors  that  influenced  the  decision.    The  answer  to  the   research  question  has  become  crystal  clear  and  very  simple:  the  decision  that  the  NEB   made  on  the  Line  9  Project  was  not  a  science-based  decision.  The  reduced  scope  of  the   project  did  not  adequately  address  the  real  scope,  which  greatly  underestimated  the  risk  of   flow  reversal  and  capacity  expansion  for  the  aging  pipeline.    Many  reasonable  concerns  of   the  intervenors  had  been  blocked  by  the  rationalization  that  information  requests  were   out  of  scope.  The  real  project  would  not  receive  closer  public  scrutiny  given  the  power   relations  that  have  guided  the  business  between  the  NEB  and  Enbridge.  There  was  no   evidence  in  the  proceedings  to  demonstrate  the  NEB's  own  claims  to  expertise.  Nor  were   the  members  of  the  panel  at  arms  length  from  the  energy  sector,  and  further,  lacked  the   required  expertise.    The  decision-making  process  and  the  final  decision  were  not  sound   and  it  did  not  boost  the  public  confidence,  but,  in  fact,  lowered  it.

Seven                  Indications  and  suggestions  
                The  conclusions  of  this  research  reinforced  the  observations  that  many  researchers   (Flyvbjerg  (1998),  Yiftachel,  et  al.  (2001),  Taylor,  Kim  &  Gahbauer,  (2009),  and  Forester,   1989)  have  made:  the  misuse  of  power  is  an  effective  means  to  serve  powerful  interest   groups,  to  rationalize  decisions,  and  to  manipulate  and  distort  information;  and  the  lack  of   power  for  experts  and  specialists,  including  planners,  is  evident  in  decision-making   processes.      It  will  be  not  necessary  for  this  paper  to  further  reiterate  these  similar   findings,  but  rather  to  focus  on  seeking  further  indications,  and  even  suggestions  based  on   these  findings.    Like  the  Flyvbjerg's  case  study,  the  Line  9  project    "may  be  interpreted  as  a   metaphor  of  modern  politics,  modern  administration  and  planning  and  modernity   itself"(Flyvbjerg,  1998;  225).    

7.1  Indication  1:  It  is  interests  that  motivate  the  rationalization  
              In  the  NEB's  hearing  process,  the  applicants  and  its  supporters  went  through  the   current  formative  process  by  presenting  application  evidence  (fact,  reasoning,  science- based  factors)  to  get  approval.    The  opposed  intervenors  intervened  in  the  process  by   presenting  counter-evidence  (facts,  reasoning,  science-based  factors)  to  either  stop  the   project  or  impose  conditions.    The  S-Camp  members  and  the  O-Camp  members  are  both   interest  groups  by  nature.  For  an  interest  group,  it  is  its  nature  to  achieve  its  goal,  not   rationality,  and  not  in  the  public  interest.  In  this  particular  case,  the  S-Camp's  goal  was  to   get  approval  without  having  more  conditions  imposed  upon  it  to  suit  its  interests:  more   profit  at  lower  cost.  The  O-Camp's  goal  was  to  oppose  the  approval  or  impose  more   stringent  conditions,  mostly  motivated  by  the  safety  concerns  about  communities  and  the   environment.  The  S-Camp  members  wanted  to  lower  the  cost  of  safety,  and  at  same  time      56  

   the  O-Camp  members  wanted  to  impose  more  conditions  (at  whatever  cost)  to  ensure   safety.  In  order  to  achieve  their  goal  or  to  suit  their  interests,  both  camp  members  would   naturally  present  rationalization  as  rationality,  a  principal  strategy  to  sway  the  decision  of   the  third  party  in  favoring  their  interest  (Flyvbjerg,  1998).  This  means  it  was  interest  that   motivated  rationalizations,  and  power  was  only  a  tool  to  realize  those  rationalizations.   This  indicates  where  interests  are,  where  rationalizations  will  be  and  the  more  powerful   the  interest  groups  are,  the  more  rationalizations  can  be  achieved.  If  this  is  the  case,  the   core  objective  of  decision-making  in  the  NEB  or  planning  process  will  be  how  to  keep   distance  from  interests  by  establishing  an  independent  third  party.    

    7.2  Indication  2:  A  better  decision-making  format  and  a  true  third  party  authority   solution  
                        Even  though  our  findings  were  not  encouraging,  the  intended  format  of  the  NEB   decision-making  process  is  actually  better  than  many  decision-making  processes  in   planning,  because  there  was  an  effort  of  establishing  a  third-party  role  with  authority  to   deal  with  interests.    The  legitimacy  of  the  NEB  authority  and  its  power  comes  from  the   legislation  of  the  Canadian  Parliament.    The  NEB's  regulatory  power  is  evident  in  its  ruling.   The  basic  idea  of  this  triangle-like  process  is  that  the  third  part  (with  authority)  made   judgments  to  regulate  international  and  interprovincial  aspects  of  the  oil,  gas  and  electric   utility  industries  in  a  quasi-judicial  process.    The  Third  Party's  ruling  was  supposed  to  be   based  on  natural  justice  principles,  evidence  (fact,  science-based  factors),  implementation   of  the  regulations  and  policies  (affirmed  by  legislation)  and  rationality.  However,  this   research  revealed  that  the  NEB  was  not  a  real  third  party.  It  was  a  quasi-one,  which  was   subject  to  the  influence  of  political-economic  powers.  Thus,  the  essential  problem  of  this     NEB  decision  was  not  in  the  format  of  this  decision-making  process,  rather  it  was  on  how      57  

   to  best  establish  an  independent  third  party  authority.    By  comparison,  in  a  planning   process,  planners  seem  to  play  a  third-party  role  but  without  the  legitimate  authority  to   make  final  decisions,  which  makes  planners  vulnerable  to  fulfill  their  jobs  "in  the  face  of   power"  (Forester,  1989;  1).      Without    true  third  party  authority,  it  is  hard  for  any  decision- making  process  in  reality  to  be  fair,  open,  and  able  to  integrate  all  the  facts,  reasoning  and   science-based  factors  rationally,  because  "Power  concerns  itself  with  defining  reality   rather  than  with  discovering  what  reality  "really"  is.  This  is  the  single  most  important   characteristic  of  the  rationality  of  power,  that  is,  of  the  strategies  and  tactics  employed  by   power  in  relation  to  rationality...  power  defines  what  counts  as  rationality  and  knowledge   and  thereby  what  counts  as  reality"  (Flyvbjerg,  1998;  227).  The  indication  here  is  that  the   solution  for  improving  decision-making  quality  lies  in  the  capacity  for  a  society  to  establish   a  true  third  part  agency,  which  can  keep  a  real  arms-length  distance  from  the  influences  of   political  and  economic  interests  and  does  not  have  any  inherent  functional  conflicts.    

7.3  Indication  3:  Science-based  factors  and  empowering  expert  communities  
                            The  safety  issue  raised  the  most  crucial  technical  concerns  in  this  case.  To  estimate   whether  the  Line  9  project  would  be  safe,  science-based  methods  were  critical.    One  of  the   key  measurements  was  the  Pipeline  Integrity  Engineering  Assessment,  which  included  the   Pipeline  Risk  Assessment.  In  order  to  testify  regarding  these  science-based  methods,  the   Third-party  certification  was  not  only  necessary,  but  also  essential  (as  many  intervenors   recommended  in  this  case).  In  the  current  setting,  the  NEB  claimed  it  was  also  qualified  as   a  Third-party  Certifying  Authority.  Regardless,  granting  that  the  NEB  has  the  capacity  and   authority  to  conduct  such  a  review,  the  specialists  that  have  conducted  the  review  must   come  to  the  tribunal  to  testify  in  front  of  all  the  participants  before  the  approval.  The  NEB  

  

58  

   was  supposed  to  act  in  the  Canadian  public  interest  through  communication,  discourse,   debate,  and  third-party  review  when  necessary.  To  do  so,  it  required  that  rationality  and   justice  be  the  goals  pursued  in  the  public  interest.    When  it  referred  to  economic,  technical   and  financial  feasibility  of  the  project,  it  implied  rationality,  and  when  it  referred  to   environmental  and  socio-economic  impacts  of  the  project,  the  process  was  supposed  to   seek  justice  in  the  public  interest.  However,  rationality  and  justice  both  require  knowledge   and  expertize,  which  indicates  that  we  should  empower  expert  or  scientific  communities   not  political  agents.  When  specialists  come  to  the  front  in  the  NEB  tribunal,  the  science- based  factors  become  more  important  matters  in  the  decision-making  proceedings,  and   the  empowerment  of  experts  becomes  possible.  On  the  contrary,  when  a  regulatory  body   (a  third  party)  cannot  adequately  exercise  and  demonstrate  its  fairness  and  openness,  and   most  importantly  its  capacity  to  re-examine  science-based  methods,  the  decision-process   not  only  cannot  solve  the  problem,  but  also  will  worsen  the  situation,  in  which  all   participants  will  not  benefit.    It  was  an  extraordinarily  formative  defect  in  the  current   proceedings  of  the  NEB  to  not  have  adequate  experts  on  the  panel  (See  key  factor  1)  and   not  to  let  their  specialists  testify  publicly,  in  stead  to  keep  the  process  in  a  `black  box',   which  aroused  the  distrust  of  the  public,  and  further  intensified  the  tension  between   development  of  the  energy  sector  and  environment  safety  concerns  of  the  public.    

7.4  Indication  4:  The  cure  for  the  dilemma  in  the  public  interest  lies  also  in  the   truthfulness  of  a  third  party  authority  

                    Given  the  pipeline's  nature,  the  concerns  from  the  O-Camp  members  easily  became  a   public  interest  issue  because  a  serious  pipeline  accident  would  have  great  impact  on  a   large  number  of  people,  places  and  the  environment  (especially  water  bodies).  However,   the  Applicant,  backed  by  an  alliance,  also  represented  the  public  interest  to  some  extent:      59  

   the  energy  sector  and  its  economic  importance.  Thus,  the  third  party  faced  an  extreme   dilemma,  as  it  also  happened  to  be  the  representative  of  the  public  interest.    Even  Doucet   (2012,  p12),  from  the  C.D.  HOWE  institute,  pointed  out  the  fundamental  problem  of   current  government  regulation  processes:  "However,  they  shy  away  from  a  prescriptive  or   a  priori  weighting  of  factors,  and  do  not  precisely  define  the  public  benefit  or  public  good   of  a  project".  However,  the  hope  for  a  cure  to  this  public  interest  dilemma  is  not  in   Governments'  hands,  but  in  the  truthfulness  of  a  third  party  view  and  its  authority.    This  is   simply  because  the  establishment  of  a  Government  process  was  always  based  on  the   political  struggles  among  interested  parties.    The  fairness  of  a  decision-making  process  lies   in  the  truthfulness  of  a  third  party  authority.    

  7.5  Suggestions  for  the  NEB  
                      Considering  the  significant  accumulation  of  public  awareness  of  environmental   issues  recently  in  Canada  and  the  Line  9's  uniqueness  in  crossing  the  most  populated  area   in  Canada,  the  NEB  missed  an  opportunity  on  the  Line  9  project  to  adequately  address  the   issues.  Based  on  the  research,  the  NEB  should  make  a  series  of  changes,  which  include:  the   formative  defect  in  the  NEB  proceeding  should  be  fixed,  information  transparency  should   be  improved,  the  pubic  participant  and  engagement  program  should  be  improved,  the   science-based  factors  should  be  taken  more  seriously  and  be  put  at  the  center  of  decision- making,  the  specialists  inside  the  NEB  should  come  to  the  front  to  demonstrate  the  Board's   expertise  capacity.  From  this  paper's  perspective,  these  changes  will  be  crucial  to  assure   the  real  safety  of  the  pipeline,  and  to  ease  the  mounting  political  tension  between  the   energy  sector  that  wants  to  quickly  expand  its  business  to  overseas  markets  and  the  public   that  is  motived  by  great  concerns  about  environmental  issues.
