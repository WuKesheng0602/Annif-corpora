ABSTRACT

John R. Connon (1862-1931) was a photographer and inventor who lived in Elora, Ontario, Canada during a time of remarkable innovations in the medium of photography. In 1886, Connon began to develop one of the earliest cameras to be capable of a full 360-degree photographic panorama using a single exposure. His early dedication to the use of flexible roll film, introduced by the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company in 1885, allowed Connon to invent a camera that was ahead of its time. Through an agreement with C. P. Stirn, of C. P. Stirn's Patent Photographic Concealed Vest Cameras, Connon's design was transformed into the Wonder panoramic camera, further inspiring a succession of full-circle panoramic cameras including the Kodak Cirkut cameras. This thesis explores the history of Connon and his invention while acknowledging the history of this little-known  Canadian  inventor's  important   contribution to the history of photographic technology.

INTRODUCTION

John Robert Connon (1862-1931) of Elora, Ontario, patented a full-circle panoramic camera in 1887. This was the first revolving panoramic camera made to use a roll of newly released flexible film, allowing it to capture a full 360-degree image in a single exposure. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represented a transitional and innovative period  in  the  field  of  photography.  Prior  to  Connon's  invention,  photographers  had  been  limited   to using metal or glass photographic plates to capture fine detail in their subjects. While they also had the option of using the paper negative process, this was considered an inferior method as it resulted in a lower resolution image. After its invention in 1851, the collodion process was preferable because of its reproducibility and clear results, but the use of glass plates made it cumbersome to carry out, particularly when photographing outside of the studio. Panoramic photography was affected by the same restrictions. Photographic panoramas made by a single exposure involved the use of a curved emulsion support and usually entailed large, unwieldy view cameras incapable of capturing a view of more than 150-degrees. Overcoming these physical limitations of the materials while striving for a reproducible and high quality photographic process was a challenge for many panorama photographers. Although a variety of innovative solutions were patented, it was the invention of flexible film that truly solved the issue  of  photography's  materiality  which had hindered development of panoramic photography. Flexible roll films, first largely marketed by George Eastman, were not initially accepted by photographers. Early versions had inconsistencies and were unable to match the image quality of the glass plate. However, John Connon had been an enthusiast for this new method of making negatives and had already experimented with semi-transparent sensitized paper as an assistant in

his father's (Thomas Connon 1832-1899) traditional photography studio business. John Connon's  early  dedication  to  this  new  material  was  a  key  factor  in  the  design  and  development   of  his  full  circle  panoramic  camera.  Following  the  invention  of  Eastman's  flexible  film,  his   camera offered a new, unique and compact solution for creating 360-degree panoramic negatives. Ahead of its time, photographers and consumers were not yet aware of the possibilities  for  the  panoramic  format  and  Connon's  camera  never  enjoyed great commercial success or historical recognition. Soon the camera was outdone by similar and improved versions patented by other inventors. Because of this, John R. Connon has had little attention for his contributions to the field of panoramic photography and most of what is known about him lies tucked away in numerous archives across Ontario. This thesis examines these collections to uncover  the  story  of  John  Connon's  360-degree panoramic camera and explores how his invention contributed to the field of panoramic photography. There is little published material available about the history of photography in Canada and I was hard pressed to find any mention of Connon and his contributions. As a result my research for this thesis employed many primary sources, dating from 1852 to 1956. I first heard about John Connon from a member of the Photographic Historical Society of Canada who had written a short article about him and had suggested there was more research to be done. I was intrigued  by  Connon's  story  and  made  my  first  visit  to  the  Archives  of  Ontario  in  September  of   2013, where a large collection of his textual records are kept. My objective was to investigate his life history as well as the unique qualities of his camera and why he was only rarely mentioned in published texts on the history of photographic cameras. What I found was a vast collection of letters, prints, negatives and other records that described a detailed story about this Canadian inventor who  it  appears  has  either  been  overlooked  or  forgotten  in  photography's  history. My

research expanded to collections at other institutions across Ontario and New York State as I discovered  how  far  Connon's  invention  had  actually  taken  him. My investigations have focused on the development, significance and context of John Connon's  invention.  Throughout  this  process  I  have come across a number of other important Canadian contributors to the field of photography that went unrecognized in existing written histories. This thesis aims to construct an account of one of those contributors, John R. Connon and his invention of the 360-degree panoramic camera. In this paper I analyze the factors that prevented  Connon's  historical  acknowledgement  by  investigating  the  photographic  industry  at   the time of his invention. By providing a background of the panoramic format, the Connon family and their involvement with photography, a description of related cameras, and an evaluation  the  factors  that  affected  Connon's  success,  my  goal  is  to  not  only  reveal  the  story  of   John Connon but  also  explore  his  relationship  to  a  fascinating  time  in  photography's  history.

LITERATURE SURVEY & COLLECTIONS RESEARCH

Although  little  has  been  published  that  is  specific  to  the  invention  of  John  R.  Connon's  panoramic   camera, a survey has been conducted of relevant texts related to the history of panoramic photography and photographic technology, and the photographic industry during the late nineteenth century. The first section begins with a review of existing literature on the history of the panoramic format and camera technology, which examines panoramic painting and the history of panoramic cameras. The next section focuses on the photographic industry in North America during the late nineteenth century, including texts that refer specifically to the time period Connon was working in, in order to provide greater context for topics covered in this thesis. Following this is an examination into related published materials, such as newspaper and magazine articles. Each section pays particular attention to texts specifically referencing the Connons and photography. Finally this survey provides an overview of the primary source material located at various archival, library, and private collections that was referenced for this thesis.

The History of the Panoramic Format and Camera Technology First, this section will investigate the history of popular optical illusions and spectacles beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing through the twentieth, focusing primarily on the panorama. As described in Panoramania!, this history begins with the invention of the panorama1 in painted form by Robert Barker (1739-1836) in 1787, and is further explained by Comment,2 Oettermann3 and Huhtamo4 who highlight its international popularity and begin to describe its integration with photography. In Daguerre's  manual  (1839),  a  new  interpretation of the large-scale version is described in the format of the

diorama, an earlier invention by Daguerre that combined elements of image, light and three-dimensional space and contributed to his later invention of the daguerreotype5. This was the earliest link between the phenomenon of photography and the panoramic format I was able to find. Together, these sources provide a history of the panorama and an explanation of the desire to combine it with the medium of photography. Books focusing on the history of cameras, such as those by Lothrop6, Gustavson,7 Coe,8 and Auer9 provide useful timelines describing historical cameras used to create panoramic photography. None examine  Connon's  camera,  but  they  do  illustrate  the  capabilities  of  most  panoramic cameras during the time Connon was working on his invention, demonstrating where his invention fits into this history. These books all include the Wonder panoramic camera, a camera  based  on  Connon's  design, but descriptions of its history are inconsistent. Lothrop states: "Designed  by  J.R.  Connon,  and  patented  by  Carl  P.  Stirn,  New  York,  N.Y.  (U.S.  Patent  418,343,   December 31, 1889). Manufactured by Rudolf Stirn, Berlin, Germany, and marketed in America by  Stirn  &  Lyons,  New  York,  N.Y...  The  Wonder  Panoramic Camera is another example of the collaboration of Carl P. Stirn, New York, as patentee, though not always as inventor, and his brother,  Rudolf  Stirn,  Berlin,  Germany,  as  manufacturer  of  a  camera."6 Gustavson's  description  of  the  origins  of  this  camera is more general,  solely  crediting  its  creator  as  "made   by  Rudolf  Stirn  in  Berlin,  Germany."7 Coe  states  that  "on  6  May,  1887,  the  American  J.R.  Connon  was   granted an English patent for a rotating-camera design; his apparatus had a cord drive for turning the film rollers  as  the  camera  rotated.  Carl  P.  Stirn  patented  an  improved  version  of  Connon's  design  in  England   on  25  April,  1889.  Manufactured  by  Stirn  of  Berlin,  it  was  sold  as  the  Wonder  Panoramic  camera."8 However, Connon was in fact a Canadian, not an American. Michel Auer reiterates this statement.9

This section concludes with an examination of literature dedicated to the history of panoramic photography and its variant formats. Panoramic photography is often briefly noted in general photographic history texts. Rosenblum10 provides the most detailed account of the genre, with reference to well-known photographers such as Friedrich von Martens and Eadweard Muybridge. Harris11, in looking at the works of Eadweard Muybridge, describes the techniques of creating panoramic photographs using multiple images. Through 2002 to 2004 Brian Polden wrote a series of five short essays for Photographica World that outline the history of panoramic cameras. The most relevant is the fourth essay, which mentions Connon and  Stirn's  camera  designs  in  relation  to  other  similar  cameras.   Together the articles create an overview of the development of panoramic photography by means of examining specific examples of camera technology beginning in the 1860s and throughout the 1990s. Continuing this history, McBride12 discusses the development of the No. 10 Cirkut camera up to the 1940s. The sources in this section provide a description of the history of panoramic camera technology and  help  to  contextualize  Connon's  camera,  however  none discuss the connection between Connon and Stirn, or suggest that his ideas may have been misappropriated.

The Photographic Industry in North America During the Late Nineteenth Century In his book Early Photography in Canada13 Ralph Greenhill neglects to mention Connon, however in a later publication from 1979 by Greenhill and Birell two paragraphs are included which describe  the  photographer's  invention,  stating: "Eastman's  paper  stripping  film  was  used  by  John  Robert  Connon  (1862-1931) of Elora, Ont. in his  `whole-circle'  panoramic  camera,  which  he  patented  in  1887  in  Britain  and  the  United  States   (it was patented a year later in Canada). This camera was marketed in 1890 by Stirn & Lyon of

New  York  (famous  for  their  `Concealed  Vest  Camera',  for  which,  incidentally, Connon made sample  photographs)  and  was  advertised  by  them  as  `The  Wonder  Camera'."14 Although brief, it is a relevant description of Connon and his panoramic camera and is followed by a short history of the Connon family. The text also briefly introduces business relationships Connon developed with George Eastman and C.P. Stirn. Jenkins provides a particularly useful background on the history of the photographic industry in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in his book Images and Enterprise15. This source provides an overview of the most successful photography companies at the time while also outlining major developments contributing to the evolution of the medium. Collins16 history of the Kodak Company complements and expands upon that described by Jenkins, while Brayer17 and Ackerman18 portray  the  story  from  Eastman's  point  of  view.  These  texts  help  to  situate  Connon's  invention  during  a   time when photographic technology was changing at breakneck speed. Additional books to note in this  section  include  MacKay's  America by the Yard: Cirkut Camera Images from the Early Twentieth Century19,  which  provides  a  detailed  history  of  the  evolution  of  Kodak's   Cirkut camera through the eyes of a panorama photographer. Also, Mina Hammer Fisher, niece of David H. Houston (1841-1906), one of the first patent holders for a roll film holder, provides a unique perspective  of  the  Kodak  Company  from  another  inventor  from  Connon's  time.20

receive some mention suggesting his story has caught the attention of collectors, enthusiasts and amateur historians. Writers Steve Thorning21, Charles Long22, Claire Champ23 and Robert Lansdale24 have all written short articles about John R. Connon, in order to highlight his achievements as a Canadian photographer, inventor and historian in the Ontario area. One article in The Photo-Miniature25, discusses a timeline of the development of the panoramic  camera  and  Connon's  camera  is  listed  amongst  other   panoramic  cameras  of  the  time,  however  his  name  has  been  misspelled  as  "Cannon,".    Focus: A Journal of Photographic Interest26 featured  an  article  that  attempts  to  defend  Connon's  claim  to  the  kind  of   panoramic  camera  that  he  had  patented,  demonstrating  an  early  acknowledgement  of  Connon's  originality   and of how he lost out to improved versions of his camera patented shortly after his own.

Summary The source material listed above suggests strong interest in the topic of the panorama historically, but there are few published sources which look at panoramic photographic technology. There are many sources that discuss the No. 10 Cirkut camera, some that mention the Wonder panoramic camera, few that mention John R. Connon and even less that mention his 360-degree panoramic camera. The sources that approach  the  subject  of  Connon's  camera  tend  to  be  brief  and  factually  inconsistent.  Direct  references  to   Connon's  involvement  with  the  Wonder  panoramic  camera  occur less often. A void of information about Connon and his panoramic camera invention has been identified through the examination of secondary sources on the history of panoramic camera technology.

Archival Collections Most of the cited material has come from collections of primary sources that include textual records, photographic records, and pieces of photographic technology. The collections are housed at Archives of Ontario (Toronto, Ontario)27, Wellington County Museum & Archives (Elora, Ontario)28, Guelph University Library (Guelph, Ontario)29, Library and Archives Canada (Ottawa, Ontario)30 and George Eastman House (Rochester, New York)31. Some elements of private collections have also been included, such as the last known existing piece from John  Connon's  panoramic camera. The Connon family fonds is housed at Archives of Ontario and is made up of textual records, photographic slides, prints and negatives divided into six different series. Particularly important to this research are the twenty-six files of textual records that include letters, receipts, personal memoirs, and sketches  that  illuminate  the  story  of  John  R.  Connon's  invention.  The  letters  are  a  combination  of  both   personal and professional correspondence that provide documentation about the design and manufacture of the camera. There are also records and receipts which clearly illustrate how the camera was made, modified and operated. The photographs in this collection are very relevant to this thesis as there are both photographs  of  Connon's  panoramic camera as well as photographs made with the camera. Also significant to the Connon family fonds are the original Canadian, American, and British patents taken out by John Connon in 1887 and 1888. Another collection of Connon material can be found at the Wellington County Museum and Archives and includes: correspondence, prints and negatives. Most of this is personal and family correspondence,  but  some  does  refer  to  the  camera  invention  as  well  as  Thomas  Connon's  move  to   Canada and his decision to become a photographer by trade. Of particular importance is the collection of original panoramic prints and negatives, made by John R. Connon using both paper negatives and

nitrocellulose transparent negatives. Additional photographic prints and negatives created by the Connon Studio in Elora can also be found at Guelph University Library, as well as Library and Archives Canada. Guelph  University  Library  also  holds  a  vast  collection  of  material  related  to  John  R.  Connon's  later   professional pursuit as a historian for the village of Elora. While I quickly reviewed this material I discovered it was not relevant to this thesis and therefore, it is not referenced in this paper.

1. THE PANORAMA AND ITS ORIGINS

History of the Panoramic Format Prior to the first  public  announcement  of  photography's  invention  in  1839,  the  panorama  was  a   new and exciting format that had only recently been patented as an improvement on painting by Englishman, Robert Barker, in 1787. This idea grew out of the Age of Enlightenment, a time of a new interest and experimentation with optics and colour which lead to the development of numerous amusements  combining  light,  image,  movement  and  sound.  The  panorama's  ability  to  portray  reality  and   successfully incorporate three-dimensional elements in a way never seen before made it a spectacle that attracted large crowds32 comparable to that of the modern day motion picture. The fact that the panorama was deemed patentable at all suggests the idea was unique, marketable, and had monetary value. The type of panorama that Barker had patented was made with pre-photographic methods such as painting and engraving. Often the initial concept for the panorama would be drafted using the medium of engraving. Because of the large scale of the painted panorama, these engravings are the primary surviving documents that illustrate many of the spectacular panoramas built during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.33 The  completed  panorama,  as  outlined  by  Barker's  patent,  was  in  the  form  of  a   large-scale painting that usually portrayed a landscape of a far-away place, or a scene from a recent event, war, or fictional story. Its exhibition required that the spectator enter a cylindrical room with a raised platform to become completely surrounded by the painting. The upper and lower margins were hidden, and skylight illumination fell onto the painting from behind an overhanging canopy, preventing shadows from  interfering  with  the  audiences'  view  of  the  image.34

In 1789, Mr.  Barker's  Interesting  and  Novel view of the City and Castle of Edinburgh, and the whole adjacent and surrounding country was  exhibited  in  Barker's  home  but  with  little  success,  as  it  was   of smaller scale and did not portray a full 360-degree circle. In order to fully recognize his vision, Barker erected a 250mÂ² rotunda at Leicester Square in London, U.K. (see figure 1), where he exhibited London from the Roof of Albion Mills, which was an immediate success with the crowds. The format soon became an international craze, reaching New York by 1795 and Paris by 1800.35 The panorama remained popular throughout the nineteenth century and soon included new elements from other amusements like the diorama and the magic lantern, adding theatre, light, and movement to create a magical experience for the viewer. Alternative versions, such as the moving panorama, used a long roll of painted canvas advanced across a stage adding the illusion of seeing the image from a moving vehicle.36 As each new version was introduced the panorama quickly established itself as a form of entertainment which attracted large audiences as well as an opportunity for profit. This fascination with light and image created the perfect atmosphere  for  photography's  introduction,  by  means  of  the  daguerreotype,  the  first  commercially successful photographic process announced in 1839.

Louis Jacques MandÃ© Daguerre (1787-1851), trained as painter and patent-holder for the daguerreotype was engrossed in a lifelong pursuit of optical amusements involving light and image. He had already contributed to this field of entertainment with his invention of the diorama in 1822, which like the panorama, was viewed in a specially designed auditorium to show the audience a standard painted landscape in a fresh and original way.37 Scenes hand-painted on linen were lit through coloured screens with natural light creating the illusion of depth and atmosphere in the scene. Showings of the diorama would present multiple scenes by rotating the audience platform to reveal a new scene.38 His announcement of the daguerreotype, a photograph captured on a surface of silver-plated copper, created an even larger phenomenon, as never before had such an image been captured on a two-dimensional plane.

The Incorporation of the Panorama into Photography With the public so entranced by both the larger-than-life panorama and the intricate photographic image of the daguerreotype, it is not surprising that a desire to combine the two arose immediately after photography was first introduced. The concept of a panorama had already proven itself complicated for painters, not only because of its large-scale and complicated construction, but also due to complex issues related to perspective. The artist was challenged to find a methodology that provided a believable image with accurate perspective on a curved canvas support. However, the photographer attempting to create a panoramic image was even more limited by his or her materials, especially during the nineteenth century. Early photographic processes capable of sharp and clear images included the daguerreotype and collodion wet-plate process, both of which required the use of inflexible emulsion supports of metal and glass respectively. Paper processes allowed for flexibility to bend the material and eliminate image distortion, but could not provide the detail of the preferred processes mentioned above. These particular qualities of

photography presented additional challenges as artists and photographers attempted to create the panorama in photographic form. The available photographic processes seriously challenged anyone wanting to capture a panoramic image on a single plate. To make a photograph that is wider than the average focal plane without distortion, the camera lens needs to rotate while remaining an equal distance from a controlled area of the sensitized surface of the photographic plate (see figure 2). This rotation must occur at a specific pivot point to preserve the perspective of the final image.39 This point is particularly difficult to

find in a photographic lens which features multiple components precisely arranged and hidden within the lens barrel. In 1889, military engineer Paul MoÃ«ssard described a method for making a study of a photographic lens using an instrument  called  the  "Tourniquet"  that eased the construction of a panoramic camera. The method can be used to find the focal length and pivot point of the lens, as well as the ideal width of the exposure slit and the length and curvature of the arc.40 Prior to this date most photographers were working with the silver plated copper support of the daguerreotype, or glass plates sensitized with silver nitrate on collodion.  Without  knowledge  of  MoÃ«ssard's  "Tourniquet" identifying the ideal specifications for a panoramic camera lens while condoning to the restrictions caused by the rigid support of the photographic emulsion posed multiple obstacles that made combining the panorama with photography complicated, and with most camera systems, impossible. Methods for making photographic panoramas advanced with the photographic technologies available. Prior to the invention of any sort of specialized panoramic cameras, photographers seeking to create a panoramic image would do so by making separate exposures to create a sequence of individual images. The most basic version of this is exemplified by those made using the daguerreotype process, as

can be seen in the 1848 panorama of Cincinnati, made by Charles Fontayne and William Porter (see figure  3).  Using  a  standard  camera  on  a  tripod,  after  each  exposure  the  photographer  "would  turn  the   camera a predetermined amount before exposing the next plate, so that each image would maintain a continuous horizon line and overlap  slightly  with  the  image  of  the  preceding  plate."41 After development, these images could be cropped, trimmed, and mounted as desired, but with the daguerreotype format, the opportunity for editing was minimal. The daguerreotype, being a direct-positive process, also posed the issue that the captured images appear reversed. This meant that minor changes to the camera angle when attempting to take consecutive images would often result in a panorama that did not line up consistently. Yet, when done well, these segmented images would be displayed side by side, each with an individual frame, in a presentation often compared to looking through a window.

As glass plate negatives and paper prints (typically albumen) became popular throughout the 1860s, the technique of making segmented panoramas continued with different methods of display. In his panoramas of San Francisco, photographer and inventor Eadweard Muybridge employed the segmented

photographic panorama and adapted it to new processes. Using a process that made it easier to reproduce photographs, and  no  longer  limited  by  the  boundaries  of  a  rigid  metal  support,  many  of  Muybridge's   views used the same method as the daguerreotype panoramas. However, with paper prints  Muybridge's

final presentations were realized as foldout sections of books and albums42 (see figure 4). This new process also allowed Muybridge to experiment with overlapping prints and/or negatives, cropping and rephotographing them to create continuous images pasted together to appear as a single panorama with a view capable of exceeding 360 degrees in a single print (see figure 5). This still took time and skill, as the photographer needed to be aware of light, shadow, angle, and spacing of the exposures. Although Muybridge went on to further expand the possibilities of photography in his time and motion studies, his panoramas  remain  noteworthy  as  examples  of  a  photographer  pushing  the  medium's  limits  using  early   photographic technologies.43

Assembling a number of negatives to create a single image was a labour intensive process and photographers continued to seek more efficient methods to create a photographic panorama in a single negative. The first concept to accomplish this required the use of a curved plate or support for the photosensitive emulsion with the use of a specialized panoramic camera. These cameras worked as scanning cameras, where the curved sensitized plate was placed inside a stationary camera box while the lens was made to swivel around  the  camera's  centre  of  perspective  (see  figure  6).

This concept is exemplified by the Megaskop Panoramic Camera (see figure 7)44 and the Ellipsen Daguerreotype (see figure 8)45 panoramic camera. The daguerreotype image support used in both examples was flexed into a curved, circular shape so that the image would remain an equal distance from the lens as it turned, keeping it in focus.

cameras did not rotate with the lens and thus, achieving a full circle was not possible making it rare to find a device that could capture more than 150 degrees.46 As the popularity of the collodion glass plate negative process increased, new concepts for capturing a panorama on a flat support appeared. The Pantoscopic (see figure 10) allowed for multiple focal lengths, but could only capture images up to 110 degrees. The Gem Panorama (see figure 11), a later example not patented until 1889, had a clever design that was capable of capturing a view of up to 360-degrees47 Yet it still had the issue of being large and cumbersome requiring the use of heavy glass plates half a meter in length, inconvenient for any photographer using recently introduced dry plates, hoping to travel with the camera to capture a landscape view.

Despite the introduction of many cameras that attempted to combine the mediums of

panorama and photography, the photographic processes available prior to the 1880s prevented the successful realization of any full-circle panoramic camera. However, during this decade, advancements to the photographic medium provided photographers with new opportunities for making photographs, particularly panoramas. Flexible roll films produced by the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company of Rochester, New York, soon to become the Eastman Kodak Company, allowed for small format cameras,

such as the Kodak, that could be easily transported to capture any desired view,48 beginning  the  `snapshot   movement. Ultimately, this new development would revolutionize photography, and the timeline of its improvements closely mirror the invention of what may be considered the first 360-degree panoramic camera for use with flexible film (see figure 12), by John R. Connon of Elora Ontario.

2. THOMAS & JOHN CONNON: EARLY PHOTOGRAPHIC INVOLVEMENT

Thomas  Connon's  Arrival  in  Canada Thomas Connon (see figure 13), the father of John Connon (see figure 14), was born on the farm of Tillyeve, in the Parish of Udny, Aberdeenshire, Scotland on September 14, 1832. At the age of 8, Thomas moved to the farm of Elfhill, near Stonehaven, which was where he received his education. While serving an apprenticeship in the City of Aberdeen at a wholesale grocery he dreamed of visiting Niagara Falls Â­ his  son  John  later  described  him  as  having  "that  love   of adventure which has peopled the earth with Scotsmen"49. Thomas immigrated to Canada in 1852, first arriving in Beamsville, Ontario, and later settling in Elora in 1853 where he continued to pursue a merchant's  career,  going  in  and  out  of  partnerships

with other grocers in the area50. Eventually Connon resolved to set up his own business, operating a general store in Elora. The original building located at the corner of Mill and Metcalfe Streets still stands today (see figure 15).

The transition from citizen of populated Scotland to early settler of Upper Canada was difficult for Thomas. The village of Elora, made up primarily of other immigrants from the Scottish council  area  of  Aberdeenshire,  was  then  "on  the   edge  of  civilization",  situated  northwest  of  the   small hamlet of Guelph, about equal distance from both Toronto and Hamilton, both rapidly growing cities at the time. He relied heavily on loans from his Aunt Elizabeth to help establish his business, and also kept in close contact with her for updates about his father and brothers still residing in Scotland. Despite his struggles, Thomas became an

officer of the Elora Rifle Company and an active member of the community. In his early years,

painting and drawing were his favourite hobbies and Thomas considered pursuing a career as an artist Â­ but later decided against this path having been warned about his poor prospects for income.51 Some of his landscape paintings are held in the collections of both the Wellington County Museum & Archives and Archives of Ontario. In an 1851 issue of Art Journal, Thomas had read about the Great London Exhibition of 1851 where advertisements for the latest improvements in photography caught his eye. He first began to experiment with the medium shortly after his arrival in Elora.52 During this time, Thomas also met Jean Keith (1835-1909),  who  was  described  as  the  "first  wh ite child born on the West side of

the  Grand  River"53 and the daughter of John Keith, a carpenter who had also emigrated from Scotland. Jean and Thomas were married on November 4, 1854. Pursuing  an  Artist's  Dream through the Medium of Photography In 1859 Thomas began to make photographs for profit while running his general store. His topfloor studio was located in the back of the building and looked out over the Grand River of the Elora Gorge, an attraction of Elora that had drawn Thomas to settle there. He was the first photographer in the area and work from his studio is today referenced as significant documentation of  the  village's  early   history. In part of his regular correspondence from the spring of 1864 with his Aunt Elizabeth, Thomas

described building this new studio as well as his intention to embark upon on the new trade full-time in the coming years.54 In August of 1867 Thomas left his wife and children in Elora and returned to Aberdeenshire for the last time. During his visit he spent time photographing his family before traveling to Paris, where he attended

the Paris Exhibition. When finally returning to Elora, Thomas ended his career as a merchant, and dedicated himself to photography. The last letter that Thomas would ever receive from his father, in March of 1872, describes another request from Thomas for financial aid.55 Thomas was saving $400, which  was  the  amount  that  he  would  need  to  build  his  own  gallery,  "a  building  erected  for  the  purpose  at the  corner  of  Geddes  and  Moir  streets."56 It was completed in the spring of that same year (see figure 16). Meanwhile, as his photography business grew, so did his family. His marriage to Jean produced three children (see figure 17), Elizabeth Connon Grant (1855-1925), John Robert Connon (1862-1931), and Thomas George Connon (1869-1936).

John R. Connon Adopting the Family Trade Whilst his eldest and youngest children went on to pursue their own professions, Thomas Connon's  eldest  son,  John  R.  Connon, took up an interest in the photography trade at a young age (see figure 18). As John grew up he watched his father's  business  expand  and  actively  assisted  in   the picture room, making portraits of and getting to know many individuals from the local community (see figure 19). Living in an early Canadian settlement with the nearest photography supplier hours away in Hamilton, Ontario, Thomas learned to be self-sufficient while developing an indepth knowledge of his tools and trade. This was evident in the numerous cameras that Connon either built or modified for use in his studio. As outsourced developing and printing practices were expensive, Thomas also had to be very proficient in carrying out his own darkroom procedures. The elder Connon trained John in the popular photographic processes of the time, including daguerreotype and wet-plate collodion. Soon, John was accomplished enough  to  become  a  valuable  asset  to  the  family's   photography business, and the studio stamps on the cabinet card portraits from the Connon studio c hanged  from  "T.  Connon,  Photographer"  to  "Elora

Art  Studio"  (see  figure  20). Like his father, John had an artistic eye and an appreciation for the Canadian landscape. In his

24

free time he would spend time travelling throughout Ontario, on trips both with and without his father, to make pictures (see figure 21). Between the time John first took an interest in photography as a child and his development into a professional, the medium of photography had advanced and grown at an overwhelming pace. New chemical processes, improved photographic products and innovations in lens and camera technology all contributed to photography's  explosive  growth  as  art  form,   application and enterprise in the latter part of the nineteenth century. For example, when John first took  an  interest  in  his  father's  photographic  business,

a newly introduced dry-plate process allowed him to hike down into the Elora Gorge and capture views of the local scenery. Using new photographic papers available through a number of recently established companies - he would sell these pictures as novelty items or postcards, eventually becoming acquainted with other photographers and manufacturers across the province. By the time John had taken up his fulltime role in the studio he had already created a method that combined both dry plate and a new camera shutter technology. This enabled the Connon studio to begin offering outdoor group portraiture (see figure 22) Â­ a service that had been previously unavailable due to photography's  earlier  technical   limitations. As Thomas had followed photography's  evolution  from  the   cumbersome and complex daguerreotype to the easy-to-use dry-plate, John continued to follow  the  field's  endless  series  of

3. CHALLENGING THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC MEDIUM

Cameras & Roll-holders Prior to the success of the Eastman Kodak Company, the photographic industry was comprised of a number of moderately successful manufacturers and suppliers that shared the bulk of the market. It was a time of innovation and many inventors were acquiring patents for any idea which might prove successful in this rapidly growing market. During a time when photography was limited to professionals with the requisite equipment and understanding of chemical processes, both Thomas and John were optimistic that they might find additional ways to profit from their knowledge of photography, often times thinking beyond the scope of their small-town studio business. Noted in many letters between father and son were various ideas and inventions for their practice. A story told multiple times in the Connon family fonds57 is how, while building a stereoscopic camera, Thomas often spoke of painting photographic emulsion onto something like a spool of ribbon instead of a metal or glass plate. Thinking that a flexible film support would solve a number of the problems with his stereo camera, Thomas drew up a roll-holder design (see figure 23) and in 1881 mailed it to acquaintances at Lyon & Alexander of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, asking if it might be an idea worth pursuing. He received a reply stating that it was too expensive to manufacture with at the time. Some years later, shortly after reading an article in the October 17, 1885 issue of Scientific American about a new rollholder being manufactured by the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company, Thomas contacted them again,

27

asking if they still had his letter.58 He received a reply from Alexander, stating that he recalled the letter, but that it had gone missing from their records.59 To his death John Connon insisted that this letter did not go missing accidentally, and that the idea was stolen for the Eastman-Walker roll-holder.60 He and Thomas are quoted as saying it was  an  invention  "lost  to  Canada  from  want  of  means  not   brains."61However, many other inventors, such as Leon Warnerke, proposed similar concepts that also did not achieve the success of George Eastman. As John continued to work in the studio, he watched his  father's  ongoing  work  to  improve  upon   the  business  he  had  built.  He  acquired  the  entrepreneurial  traits  of  his  father  and  by  watching  his  father's   dedication to his work; John was motivated to contribute to their common passion for photography. Because of his own feeling of loss with the roll holder, Thomas strongly encouraged John to pursue his own ideas and inventions rather than settle into the life of a small town photographer.

Shutters & Other Experimentation As Thomas continued to operate the studio in Elora, John began experimenting with the possibilities of photography while assisting his father. During the transition from wet to dry plate photography, in 1882 John began photographing group portraits outdoors by the river. However, he needed a method for making exposures while also keeping an eye on the group to ensure they remained still and in position. In a time when film

lacked high sensitivity and required long exposures photographers had to uncap the portrait lens to make a long time exposure. This method frustrated John who found he could not watch the group and take the photograph simultaneously because he was busy with the lens cap. He resolved this problem by creating a shutter  using  a  single  blade  that  "opened  and  closed  the  small  opening between the lenses, which was the shortest  distance  to  move".  He  used  this  style  of  shutter  in  his  work  for  three  years  before  building  a  set  of   shutters into a pair of lenses to use with a stereoscopic camera, the same camera Thomas had been working on when he conceived of his rollholder idea (see figure 24). In 1891, John was issued an American patent (see figure 25)62 for the idea he had been using for almost a decade, but he never expected this invention to be profitable outside of his own practice because it required that he make a customized shutter to fit each separate lens, meaning it could never be adapted to widespread use.63 The  story  of  John's  shutter   continued into September of 1885, when he took his stereoscopic camera with the new lenses to Rochester to visit his friend

James  Inglis,  who  was  then  employed  as  a  dry  plate  manufacturer.  During  John's  visit,  Inglis  had  been   working with a German optician, Mr. Ernst Gundlach, a well-known lens designer at the time who oversaw the development of the microscope division of Bausch & Lomb64 as well as the Gundlach Optical Company that later became the Rochester Lens Company. Inglis shared with John some photographs taken as part of his own experimentation. One image had been with a newly designed focal plane shutter that successfully stopped the motion of a bicyclist Â­ the resulting photograph capturing the spokes of his moving wheels with almost perfect clarity. John was eager to try it out for himself, and after his return to Elora anxiously searched for an ideal opportunity. It soon came in the winter of 1886, when he learned the old wooden bridge over the Irvine River was to be replaced with a steel one. On the day of its demolition, John had prepared his own shutter and set-up his camera, ready to fire at the perfect moment. John was very pleased with the results (see figure 26),  stating  "when  shown  with  a  magic  lantern   and  greatly  enlarged  there  is  no  sign  of  movement  during  the  exposure."65 John had begun to successfully expand the Connon studio's  photographic  products and services as he familiarized himself with the progress of the photographic industry. He was positive and self-assured by his accomplishments and continued to explore what else could be achieved with the medium. Supported by his father, John found himself on a path of photographic discovery.

Conceiving 360-Degree Panoramic Camera Engrossed in the  medium  of  photography  and  excited  by  the  field's  progressive  nature,  John   proceeded to test the boundaries of what he could capture in a photograph. In an account of his experience conceiving the idea for his most notable invention, a panoramic camera that could capture a full-circle in a single exposure, John described his frustration with the limitation of the standard frame sizes available  to  him.  "It  was  late  in  the  summer  of  1886  that  I  tried  to   secure a satisfactory picture of Elora from the hill overlooking the village from the east. The negative was quite good, what there was of it, but it only showed part of the village and it would require three such pictures to take in all that should be shown. This was the picture that set me thinking about the panoramic  camera."  The  tallest  building  in  the  area  at  this   time was a store that belonged to Lt. Colonel Clarke, a friend  of  John's. Having previously photographed from this location, Clarke had stated to John that "there  is  no  use  taking  a  picture  from  the  top  of  this  place   until  you  can  make  one  the  whole  way  `round."66 John then began investigating the possibility of capturing a panoramic image (see figure 27). At first, as  MoÃ«ssard's  "Tourniquet"   method was not yet published, Connon was

uncertain  if  the  lens  could  be  rotated  around  a  pivot  point  without  jeopardizing  the  image.  "A  few   experiments showed that if the centre of rotation coincides with that point in a lens, or lenses where the light  crosses,  it  does  not  matter  how  fast  the  lens  may  spin  around,  the  picture  remains  quite  still."67 With this new understanding about the where the centre of rotation for his camera should be, John further described  his  first  attempts  at  making  a  photograph.  "Taking  an  empty  box  that  had  once  been  used  to   hold  tins  of  Keen's  Mustard,  I  arranged  a  support  against  which  to  place  some  bromide  paper  in  the  shape   of half a circle and in the centre of the semicircle was placed the lens, between which and the paper a narrow  box,  like  a  hollow  door  swung  on  centres  above  and  below  the  lens."68 Based upon this description it can be understood that John had made a camera comparable to the Megaskop or the Ellipsen Daguerreotype, both swivel lens type cameras,69 as well as the Kodak Panoram which was introduced at a later date. The lens of the camera swung in unison with the narrow slit box (the hollow door) whiles the curved bromide paper remained stationary in the camera. As the lens and slit box rotated, a tall, narrow image moved across the sensitized paper, making an undistorted exposure (see figure 28). Although John had yet to achieve a camera capable of capturing a full-circle image, with this camera he was able to achieve his first successful panoramic negative during the summer of 1886 (see figure 29), which gave him the confidence to pursue further panoramic experiments. "Having  loaded  [the  camera]  up  I  tried  a   picture with it in the centre of the village [of Elora]. It was quite as good as a paper negative would make it and worked perfectly. The negative...shows by the vacant lots where buildings now stand, the date of it---1886."  70 Unsatisfied with the capabilities of his simple revolving mustard box camera, which was incapable of capturing a view much greater than 150-degrees,

John established a goal to capture a full circle with a single exposure. He considered the swinging hollow door of his first camera to be like the focal plane shutter and determined that he would need to find a way to feed the film past the barrel of the lens at the same rate it would take to make an exposure. In doing so, he would be able to capture a continuous 360-degree image on a single negative. Familiar with his father's  concept  for  the  roll-holder, as well as the similar Eastman-Walker model, conceiving a way to do this  wasn't  difficult  for  John.  Finding  an  effective  way  to  construct  it  proved  more  challenging.  He  first   tried using rubber rollers, about an inch in diameter, which he had custom made by the Toronto Rubber Company for $3.00 (75 cents each).71 But due to inconsistencies in the material and manufacturing, the rubber was not ideal and ultimately unsuccessful. He then tried to substitute the rubber with paper rollers. He described stringing the paper onto steel centres like washers after being clamped tight. John acknowledged a young man, Jamie Lister, who was learning the machinist's trade in Elora at the time John was making his camera. Lister helped John with the lathe work he needed to do to ensure that his paper rollers were perfectly circular. These rollers worked effectively72 and were used in the making of his first full-circle panoramas, but they were later substituted for custom brass rollers made by a company in Guelph for $7.1073 that John found to work even better.

John designed his fixed-focus camera to advance the roll of negative paper (purchased from a J. R. Moodie & Sons in Hamilton, Ontario)74 as the camera was turned around its optical centre on a tripod. With the assistance of Donald C. Ridout of Donald C. Ridout & Company, Engineers & Solicitors of Canadian, United States, and Foreign Patents75, Connon obtained American76, British77 and Canadian78 patents issued throughout 1887 and 1888.

The patented model used four rollers, one for holding the unexposed roll of film, one for holding the exposed film, and two used as friction-rollers that kept the exposed film held taut and at the proper distance from the lens. It used a crank-handle that connected to the bottom of the camera and was fixed to a wormpinion that attached to a spur-wheel forming the top of the tripod stand. Hence, when turning the crank, the camera would be made to rotate at the pivot point of

the lens. The top of the tripod stand, made up by the spur-wheel, featured a groove in which a cord was passed around and through pulleys that were attached to the spindles of the rollers. This caused them to revolve and advance the film with the rotation of the camera. John used a fishtail lens barrel (see figure 28) to control the amount of light reaching the sensitized surface and ultimately prevent distortion. He did this by creating a narrow vertical passageway of a specific width that, like the hollow door, allowed the light to travel through in a scanning motion before meeting with the film as it passed by, exposing the image (see figure 32). The final version of his camera shows some modifications to that illustrated in the patents. As opposed to using a handle-crank, John has replaced the spur-wheel with a clockwork system. There is now a wind-up key at the top of the camera used to begin the rotation and start the exposure. A complete model of this camera is yet to be discovered, but the lens shown in figure 30 is suspected to be original to Connon's  camera,  and  features  grooves  that   Connon would have used to slide it into place on the camera body before taking a photograph.

4. MANUFACTURING THE PANORAMIC CAMERA

The Photographic Industry during the 1880s The timeline of John Connon's  panoramic  camera  is  fascinating  in  relation  to  the  invention  of   George  Eastman's  first  flexible  roll  films,  both  paper  and  nitrocellulose.    It  was  Eastman's  innovations   with flexible films and a newly designed camera system that ultimately changed the course of the photographic  medium.    Eastman's  Kodak  camera  introduced  an  inexpensive  and  easy  to  use  photographic   system that democratized the technology making it available to all. Because John was so interested in this type of film, he was one of the first photographers to use it instead of the more common photographic glass  plate.  This  important  timing  and  history  made  John's  panoramic  camera  one  of  the  first  to  use   flexible film and it could be argued that his invention contributed to the later development and introduction of the Kodak Camera by the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company in 1888. Already familiar with the ideas his father had proposed for the roll film holder, John had been considering the possibilities of a flexible film base for his panorama camera. The release of early Eastman flexible films allowed him to incorporate this technology into his own photographic invention at a time when most other  photographers  could  not  yet  see  the  future  possibilities  of  Eastman's  innovations.    It  should be noted that  Eastman's  first  versions  of  his  flexible  films  were  developed  for  professional  view  cameras  that  used   the Walker-Eastman roll film holder Â­ and that these films were plagued with numerous problems that most professionals found unappealing. George Eastman (1854-1932), was born to the owner and administrator of a successful business school, the Eastman Commercial College, in Rochester, New York. As  the  result  of  his  father's  sudden   and unexpected death while he was still a boy, Eastman grew up watching his mother struggle to maintain the lifestyle their family had been accustomed to. After some years of both private and public education, Eastman found work as a clerk in an insurance office and later as an assistant bookkeeper in a bank. He

38

first began practicing photography in 1877 and quickly became a serious amateur.80 Inheriting the entrepreneurial spirit of his father, Eastman began the production of gelatin dry plates, soon gaining the financial backing of Henry A. Strong (1838-1919), a successful buggy-whip manufacturer.81 The professional experience and ambition of Eastman combined with the support of Strong are important factors that led to their ultimate success in the photography industry as the Eastman Kodak Company. Having achieved success as the Eastman Dry Plate Company, Eastman sought a replacement for the glass support of his gelatin dry plates. In 1881 the Eastman Dry Plate Company introduced gelatinbromide printing papers, a product Connon had mentioned using. Meanwhile, Eastman continued to seek more efficient manufacturing methods and higher quality products, while competing against new manufacturers.82 By 1885, in collaboration with William H. Walker, and after studying the Warnerke roll holder (a similar device invented circa 1875), the duo was issued a patent for the Walker-Eastman roll holder. With this system, a film consisting of a paper strip coated with regular dry plate emulsion was produced.83 "This  negative  paper  film  was  not  nearly  as  satisfactory  as  a  transparent  film because the printing had to be done through the base of the paper, giving the prints a washed-out, faded, or even grainy appearance. Treatment of the paper with light oils prior to printing helped increase the transparency, but the paper film was never  popular."84 Despite its lack of popularity, this description of Eastman's  early  negative  paper  best  matches  the  first  panoramic  negatives  produced  by  Connon (see figure 34), many of which have yellowed from apparent oiling (see figure 34). Another type of film, stripping film or American film, had also been introduced in 1885, but was delicate and required a complicated developing process, preventing Eastman from actively promoting it for use with the rollholder  system.  "The  company  policy  was  to  persuade photographers to purchase the roll holder and

acquaint themselves with its operation using negative paper and then hope to introduce them to American film  later,  when  they  already  knew  how  to  use  the  roll  holder."85

Figure 34. John R. Connon, [View of the Village of Elora?], ca. 1887. A1977.67.213, ph2763, Wellington County Museum and Archives.

Because  all  of  Connon's  existing  early negatives86 are on a paper base, it can be presumed that prior  to  the  release  of  nitrocellulose  films,  Connon  had  only  used  rolls  and  sheets  of  Eastman's  negative   paper  and  not  Eastman's  American  stripping  film.  The complex process of American stripping film is explained by Douglas Collins in the following passage: "American  film  was  a  three-ply film, consisting of an ordinary paper support and a layer of gelatin emulsion, which were separated by a middle layer of water-soluble gelatin. After the film was photographically exposed, the negative was taken from the camera and placed emulsion-side down upon a glass plate. Hot water was poured over the film, which melted and dissolved the inner layer of soluble gelatin. Paper and soluble gelatin were then carefully stripped away, leaving only the thin layer of exposed gelatin emulsion on top of the glass plate. Once the film had been peeled down to its thin emulsion layer, another piece of wet, sticky transparent gelatin was squeegeed on top of the emulsion. After this double layer had dried, the emulsion skin could be  lifted  from  the  glass  and  printed  in  the  usual  way."87

None  of  Connon's  negatives  exist  on  either  glass  plates  or  the  separately  purchased88 gelatin skins described for carrying the emulsion layer after the excess paper and gelatin had been stripped away. Although American film provided a more transparent alternative to Eastman negative paper, Connon chose not to use it when it was the only roll film available to him during a shortage of their later nitrocellulose transparent non-stripping film, released first in 1888.89 This choice may have been because of its complicated development process that would have been made even more so when processing larger panoramic images. However, despite  Connon's  preference for paper and nitrocellulose films, it was the availability of flexible films was what allowed Connon to design, build and continue to develop his panoramic camera.

Correspondences, Advice and Negotiations After completing the final touches and experiments to perfect his camera in order to determine additional details such as exposure and speed of camera rotation, John Connon needed to seek out a manufacturer.  He  was  wary  of  his  father's  loss  with  the  roll-holder idea and knew he needed to act fast if he wanted to find a market and receive recognition for his invention. Throughout the 1850s, 60s, and 70s, Scovill Manufacturing Company maintained its position as one of the top North American producers of photographic materials.90 "Yet,  the  leadership  of  Scovill and Anthony companies continued to depend upon external sources of invention. When an improvement was created, the managers of Scovill and Anthony sought to acquire it outright through purchase or to control it through a sole agency for its sale."91 This strategy resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of photographic patents issued in the United States throughout the 1880s and 1890s,92 which was likely observed by Connon and part of his motivation for pursuing profit from his invention after he received his patent. It was no surprise then that

Scovill was the first manufacturer Connon approached about his panoramic camera, immediately after receiving his American patent. From September of 1887 to March of 1888 John, under the guidance of his father, was in contact with a man named Mr. Fuller at Scovill. At first the correspondence was hopeful, and negotiations for a began almost immediately. The question of expectations for a royalty was met with an eager reply. A letter from Thomas Connon dated September  28,  1887  stated  "Being the value on which to seek royalty at the cost of the Camera written plus lens and tripod [John and I] think twenty percent a reasonable figure for the American patent. Plus a camera whose wholesale price is twenty-five dollars from you would yield twenty to [Scovill] and five to the patentee."93 Scovill was interested because of the potential advantages of the camera for use in landscape work; however, in the months following these negotiations, letters from Mr. Fuller described  an  increasing  number  of  delays  preventing  the  camera's  manufacture.   First Scovill needed to confirm the market for such a camera and then they needed to build a sample. The construction of this sample was again delayed because the company was so busy. In March of 1888 Mr. Fuller still had not been able to discuss constructing this sample model with his superintendent. While waiting to hear the results of this discussion, John and Thomas Connon were notified that Mr. Fuller was on leave for bereavement, another delay.94 Once Mr. Fuller had returned, he informed the father and son that the decision on his camera had been deferred again due to a snowstorm that had shut down their factory for a week.95 Finally, after several months of increasingly discouraging replies regarding the plans for his camera, John requested it be returned so that he could seek a manufacturer elsewhere. A receipt dates  the  camera's  return  to  John Connon as March 21, 1888. After his disheartening experience with Scovill, J. R. Connon sought the help of acquaintances in the field to assist him with the business aspects of marketing his camera. He discussed his invention with

friends who were involved in some successful North American photography companies at the time. These individuals included: James Inglis, Scottish born photographer and dry-plate manufacturer, as well as former photographer of St. Catharines, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec, who by then had settled in Rochester; Maurice Gennert, successor to the G. Gennert Company, Importer, Exporter and Manufacturer of Photographic Materials, located in New York City; and Joseph Platt, Special Agent, Berkshire Life Insurance Company in New York and active member of the New York Camera Club.96 Although none agreed to manufacture the camera themselves, Platt did put Connon in touch with an adventurous businessman, Carl P. Stirn, who owned a shop on Park Place and was interested in Connon's  camera.97 John Connon soon travelled from Elora to New York City to meet Stirn and pursue further negotiations (see figure 35).

John's  Camera  Becomes  the  Wonder A telegram sent by John Connon from New York to his father in Elora on February 4 of 1889 excitedly  exclaimed,  "Successful,  Stirn  to  manufacture  for  Germany,  Britain,  America."98 The agreement, signed by Stirn & Connon on February 25, 1889 (see figure 36) was the first glimmer of hope Connon saw in the success story of his panoramic camera. It outlined that Connon would grant Stirn the sole right to manufacture panoramic photographic cameras under his patent for a royalty relative to the cost of the camera sold. Satisfied that his camera was finally going into production, John returned to Elora, where he continued work in the studio with his father. During this time he regularly prepared batches of panoramic prints and enlargements that he would send to Stirn to sell in his shop. He regularly received updates from Stirn's  builder, a German mechanic named Max Juruick. Juruick was assigned with the task of building a model  from  John's  patent  that would be more marketable. Meanwhile, Connon started to sell some of Stirn's  Concealed  Vest  Cameras99 for commission in the Canadian market. Throughout  1889  Connon  received  regular  updates  from  Stirn  regarding  Juruick's  progress  on  the   panoramic camera.  Stirn  began  advertising  the  remodeled  version  of  Connon's  camera  as  "The  Wonder   Camera",  despite  the  fact  that  he  had  no   stock and the finished model was far from ready for the market. Stirn had hoped to introduce the camera at the renowned Boston Exhibition that year but delays related to streaky image results prevented the camera from arriving in time.100.

of the factory receiving an order of the wrong size of lenses101, but Connon was comforted to know that his invention was in production and would soon be available for sale in an open market (see figure 37). Although originally designed by Connon, and built by Juruick, C.P. Stirn was issued the American patent for the camera on December 31 of the same year (see figure 38).102 Perhaps, it was this development

that that led to the many inaccuracies

"In  the dark room a roll of sensitive film is placed inside the camera. When you wish to take a picture, the Camera attached to the tripod is set up in the position desired; then, pull the string which causes the camera to revolve. The sensitive film being brought to the focus of the lens as required  to  receive  the  picture  of  everything  that  the  camera  points  at."

Four different lengths of exposures could be made: a quarter circuit, producing a negative 4 Â½ inches in length; a half circuit, producing a negative 9 inches in length; a three-quarter circuit, producing a negative 13 Â½ inches in length; and a full circuit, for which the negative would measure 18 inches. The spring catch, located on the base of the camera, had four corresponding settings to select the desired format. Once ready to take the picture, the user would then uncap the lens and pull a string to revolve the camera and  advance  the  film,  using  the  same  principles  as  Connon's  original  design.104 The string was directed through the camera and featured a ring from which different weights could be hung to ensure an evenly paced exposure (see figure 40). Based upon examinations of the Wonder camera at the George Eastman House, the changes made to  John's  camera  appear to improve upon its functions making it easier for both amateurs and

A puncture device was also added to the back of the camera that would allow the user to mark each exposure on the film. It was made for use with 3-Â¼-inch American Stripping Film. Also, the weighted string was an alternative method to a wind-up key or crank designed by  Connon.    In  Stirn's  opinion  these  modifications  were  significant  enough  to  justify  an  application for his own patent, though Connon questioned them. In a letter to Connon, Connon Sr. suggested his own improvements were  superior  to  those  in  Stirn's  patent  asking,  "Do you think the camera is any improved by the movement as you describe it over the old? Of course it is out now and if it is in such a way that any intelligent person can work it perhaps it is just as well to let it be all that for a time, but I think I can make an automatic movement that will do the whole business in a very simple way without cogs."105 While there was some additional discussion about the best way forward, Connon ultimately accepted the modifications to his original camera design and January of 1890, moved to New York to go into business with Stirn.

A Short-Lived Success Story It was only a few short months before prospects for the Wonder panoramic camera began to fade. Around the time of its release in February of 1890, Eastman had also begun to sell transparent celluloid film. This revolutionary film was a material that had long been sought out by photographers, as it had the flexibility of paper combined with the clarity of glass. Unfortunately, it was just  to Â¼ of an inch too wide  to  fit  within  the  flanged  edges  of  the  Wonder's  roll  holders.  In  order  to  use  this  new  and  much   sought  after  material,  Connon  would  need  to  modify  his  camera  once  again.  "From  the  edge  of  the  film   which I used when making sample pictures with the new camera in New York during February and March 1890, I cut a strip with scissors. Of course, this had to be done in the dull red light of the dark room"106 (see figure 41). Even with this unfortunate modification that was necessary to be able to use transparent film with the Wonder, the new and popular material was still not readily available, making prospects for the camera less and less promising.

In a letter to his sister Lizzie, Connon described his plan to leave Stirn and return to Elora, "owing  to  scarcity  of  film  for  this  panoramic  camera  because  of  a  patent  lawsuit  which  the  Eastman  Co.   [had] got into; there [would] not be any film for a few months anyway. Without that the cameras [were]

useless."107 In fact, Eastman had been working on this new transparent film throughout the time that the Wonder was manufactured, yet due to the patent infringement issues that had arisen from the historic Hannibal B. Goodwin108 case,  Eastman  had  "cloaked  the  new  film  and  its  production  in  secrecy."109 Once it was first available for public sale in August of 1889, production was slow and the film was hard to come by. Any requests John made for the film were met with replies from the Eastman Company stating there was a shortage and asking if John would have them ship American film instead.110 However, by the time the Wonder was ready for sale in February of 1980, the new celluloid-based film was popular enough to take over the market. Combined with the introduction of the Kodak box camera, the Wonder was both unusable and undesirable. After discussing the matter with Stirn, John took some time to visit the  sites  before  again  returning  to  Ontario.  He  went  back  to  work  in  his  father's  studio,  and  continued   selling prints and enlargements to Stirn and other acquaintances, as well as occasionally selling a camera. Despite the discouraging roll film situation, Stirn was not ready to give up on the Wonder and continued to market the product, placing ads in both European and North American photography journals. However, in 1893 his optimism died down. In a letter of that year just a month after their agreement had expired, Stirn wrote Connon for help stating: "I  am  very  sorry  to  say  that  the  outlook  for  our  Panoramic  Camera  is  not  very  encouraging;  I   would like myself to make something out of it, as I invested several thousand dollars in it, and do not see any prospects of making one cent out of the invention. The Cameras which Mr. Max. Juruick made for me are entirely worthless, unless somebody takes hold of them, and makes them all over, as they are now, it is impossible for an amateur or even an expert photographer to work with  them.  I  wish  you  could  find  some  way  of  making  them  over,  so  that  we  could  sell  them."111

In October of 1895, John received a similar letter from Gennert, again inquiring about the stock of Wonder  panoramic  cameras  that  had  been  left  unusable,  stating  "Mr.  Stirn  is,  we  believe,  selling  out  his   stock of Panoramic Cameras. Do you think that any of the parts of these cameras would be of any use to us? We have just received a notice and we believe the entire outfit will be sold at auction."112 Around this time,  "the  firm  of  Stirn  &  Lyon  became  involved  financially,  and,  sometime later, made an assignment. The camera business had nothing to do with this, so it was only a comparatively small side issued controlled by Mr. Stirn, but, owing to the failure of the toy business which they were engaged in, the camera  business  came  to  an  end."113 However, there is no indication within the textual records at either Archives  of  Ontario  or  the  Wellington  County  Archives  as  to  what  became  of  Stirn's  stock,  or  as  to   Connon's  reply  to  either  Stirn  or  Gennert. A final opportunity for John to contribute with his patent arose in 1895 when Gennert again contacted him regarding a request for a large-scale panoramic camera: "Mr.  Geo.  E.  Curtis  of  Niagara  Falls,  New  York  wants  a  Panoramic  Camera  to  use  10-inch film and 12 or 14-inch lens. He really wants two lenses with it but we have explained to him that he must have a camera for each focal length. Could you give me an idea of what it is worth to make such a camera? If Mr. Curtis wishes it will you kindly make the drawings for it? He really wants you to make it but of course, you have not the facilities. We can do it much better. We would want  to  have  you  make  the  drawings  so  as  to  avoid  any  errors."114 An interesting request Connon made drawings for the camera which Gennert proceeded to construct. However, Mr. Curtis was in contact with Connon multiple times throughout 1896 regarding issues with

5. THE QUEST FOR RECOGNITION

The Kamaret, Cycloramic, Cirkut and Others In 1891 Connon started to notice cameras using a technology similar to his own appearing on the market. He came across an advertisement for the Kamaret while working for Gennert (see figure 42), and recognized that the position of the roll-holders was a potential infringement of his own patent. John mailed  it  to  his  father  with  a  letter  stating  "I notice that the party who stole this from my panoramic camera patent knows so little about the practical part of photography that this roller would be placed emulsion side out so that it could not be handled without marking."
116

Despite this accusation, and suggestions

from his father to go to Ottawa to begin an

infringement case, Connon never took any action to defend his patent. Connon continued to find published articles and advertisements for panoramic cameras that he felt were encroachments on his design. He found himself in a dispute with another panoramic camera inventor, Marcellus, whose invention he read about in an issue of

the Chicago Photo Beacon of 1894. Marcellus's  camera,  named  the  Cycloramic117, used many aspects of John's  patent,  but  offered  an  improved  design  allowing  the  user  to  change  the  focus  along  with  other  new   features that made it easier to use (see figure 43). Some of this discussion was featured in issues from October 1894 to January 1895 of the Photo Beacon. The Chicago publication refused to take sides and eventually notified Connon that they would no longer be pursuing the issue in their publication.118 Later in the

year of 1895, Connon came across another  article  titled  "New  Invention  

in  Photographic  Panoramic  Technology"  patented  by  G.  Rockwood  &  H.  B.  Shallenberger  in  1890119, and featured in the November 24 issue of the New York Herald (see figure 44). Connon immediately contacted the publication, as he had demonstrated his own camera to Rockwood four years prior, but received a response that they would not be making any corrections. Another camera that John found with similarities to his own included an invention that would become the Kodak Cirkut camera, patented by

William J. Johnston (1856-1941), the Canadian founder of the Panoramic Camera Company of Canada in 1904 (see figure 45).120 Johnston had also been a founder of the Rochester Panoramic Company, along with David A. Reavill and Frederick W. Brehm. In 1905, Reavill left the company and it was sold for $5000 to the Century Camera Company, then owned by Eastman Kodak Company, which continued the manufacture of the Cirkut into the 1940s121. When the company was sold, Johnston, originally from a suburb near Kingston, Ontario, returned to Canada where he began the Canadian version of his company in Toronto, Ontario.122 Connon,  who  read  an  article  about  Johnston's  camera  in  the  Toronto  Daily  Star   from February 29, 1905, wrote to the editor for a correction, which was printed on March 8th of the same year, a small success story for John.123

Last Attempts to Sell the Patent During the years John was involved with Stirn he received updates about camera sales and requests for additional prints. He also corresponded with Maurice Gennert, who asked him to return to New York City to work for him. Connon agreed, and spent the spring of 1891 keeping track of stock in Gennert's  shop  as  well  as  assisting  amateur  customers.  Unhappy  with  this  position  and  concerned for his parents'  declining  health,  Connon  returned  to  Elora(in  1892?)  and  hired  broker  E.J.  Johnson  to  try  and   sell his patent during his travels through the states. He paid Johnson $15.00124 to find a buyer for his invention but in 1893 Johnson gave up his  broker's  position  and  passed  Connon's  patent  onto  Mr.   Williams who finally found a potential buyer in 1899. Mr. Clougher, from the Canadian Camera and Optical  Company,  showed  serious  interest  in  purchasing  John's  patent  for  $500  along  with $100 for two shares in the company. Originally, John was insulted by this offer, as he had hoped to make at least

$1000. But, after a decade of trying to make use of his camera, John was willing to take what he could get. Unfortunately, negotiations went sour and after an unfavourable investigation Clougher changed his company's  offer  to  only  $200  in  shares.125 Although his broker Mr. Williams discouraged Connon from accepting this low offer, John was tired of chasing what now appeared to be an impossible dream. On April 12,  1900,  just  over  a  year  after  his  father's  death,  he  wrote:  "I  do  not  feel  like  doing  any  more  with   it."

Seeking Acknowledgement After failed attempts to manufacture his camera and sell his patent, Connon began to spend a great deal of time scanning newspapers and science and photography journals for cases of infringement. Although never having the means to get into a serious legal battle, Connon wrote with dogged determination to editors demanding they correct articles stating that inventions similar to his own were described  as  "new"  and/or  "original".  Connon  often  claimed  many  later  camera  models  stole  the  position   of the roll holders from his patent, placing them in front of the focal plane, allowing for smaller sized cameras.126 He  felt  that  Eastman's small-sized Kodaks did this, but was never able to make a case for it.127 In a 1921 letter to George Eastman, John mentions this observation, to which Eastman replied that the idea had been purchased from another inventor, David H. Houston.128 Connon was one of many patentholders making accusations against Eastman during the time that the Eastman Kodak Company was growing exponentially. However, like the other inventors, Connon had neither the business savvy nor the financial and legal resources of the Eastman Kodak Company. As photography became accessible to the masses, everyone was searching for a faster, easier and less expensive way to make photographs, and

many inventors contributed pieces to this complex puzzle. Some were successful selling their patents while others secured positions in the growing research and development divisions of companies like Eastman Kodak Company. However, there were many inventors, like Connon, who poured their lives into their inventions and never received recognition or financial reward and these individuals inevitably developed a bitter attitude towards entrepreneurs like Eastman, a man who is often described as a modern day Steve Jobs, American entrepreneur and co-founder of Apple Inc. Like Jobs, Eastman was able to create products that were irresistible to consumers because he was successful in transforming a complex and expensive process practiced only by professionals and into a cheap, easy to use system that was available to all.

The Story of Hannibal B. Goodwin and Eastman Flexible Films John continued to try and make something of his invention well into the twentieth century, and carefully followed the case of Rev. Hannibal B. Goodwin for inspiration. Goodwin, an Episcopal minister from New Jersey, filed a patent application for a method of making transparent, flexible roll film out of a nitrocellulose film base in May of 1887. However, his patent was not granted until September of 1898. At the time there was a huge demand to find a transparent film base for holding a photographic emulsion, as, such  as  seen  in  Connon's  early  negatives,  because  this  new  flexible  support  eliminated  many  of   photography's  technological  limitations.  During  the  eleven  years  Goodwin  was  waiting  for  his  patent,   Eastman had begun production of roll film using his own process. Like Connon, Goodwin was from a small town, made a small salary, and had an amateur interest in chemistry. Once the patent was obtained it was eventually sold to the photographic company Ansco for a reasonable amount at the time. Ansco, realizing this patent was the key to the enormous success of the Kodak camera system, proceeded to sue the Eastman Kodak Company for infringement. In 1914, the courts ruled in favour of Ansco and awarded the company a settlement of five million dollars Â­ an enormous sum of money at that time. Unfortunately, in the year 1900, Goodwin had been involved in a street accident and died from his injuries.

57

In  relation  to  these  events,  Connon  wrote:  "When  I  remember  that  in  1890  the  man  who  invented the process of making the transparent celluloid film which I was using so successfully was struggling to secure a patent for his invention and died a poor man while the United States Patent Office allowed Eastman Co. with their stolen millions to hold up his claims for eleven years, I feel that my father and I were  not  the  only  sufferers."129 This passage suggests that Connon saw his own life in the tragic story of Goodwin and perhaps this made it easier for him to accept his own fate. Regardless it was around this time that Connon abandoned his goal to secure recognition for his invention and decided to move on with his life and pursue other activities unrelated to his panorama camera.

Life for Connon after the Panoramic Camera The last thirty years of his life Connon continued photography as a hobby and became a historian (see figure 46). He published a book titled The Early History of Elora, Ontario, and Vicinity, which is still today one of the most significant early histories of the area. He never could completely turn off his innovative mind and would correspond with friends about ideas he had for new inventions in the photographic field. In some letters from 1903 he mentioned an idea for a motion picture camera, but decided not to follow through with it. By this time, George Eastman and his Eastman Kodak Company were selling their Brownie cameras for $1 each to a global population, now making their own photographs. Perhaps Connon felt that opportunities for individual inventors like him were even scarcer than before, when he had struggled to gain recognition for his panoramic camera. Today historians continue to  revisit  the  medium's  history  and  revise  our  understanding  of  the  photography's  early  decades.     While John R. Connon and his father Thomas Connon were never able to secure widespread recognition for their contributions to the history of photographic technology, my hope is that this paper will provide an opening for future researchers and further investigations into a fascinating time of photographic innovation and the story of the Connon family and their contributions to the field of photography in

Canada.      John  Connon's  panoramic  camera  represents  the  beginning  of  360-degree panoramic photography captured in a single exposure on flexible film and its design inspired a succession of cameras that made the dream of capturing a full circle view in a photograph a reality.

APPENDIX: EVOLUTION OF MATERIALS USED BY JOHN AND THOMAS CONNON Timeline of Photographic Materials used by John & Thomas Connon 1840-1852 Painting & Drawing Thomas Connon was described to have thoroughly enjoyed drawing as a child; the best gift you could give him was a pencil and some drawing paper. That passion later expanded to oil painting. Prior to his engagement with photography, Thomas had often considered the career of an artist. Some of his paintings of the Ontario landscape are currently held at archives in Toronto and Elora. Daguerreotype Shortly after settling in Elora, Thomas Connon began his first experiments with the photographic medium, using the daguerreotype process. A handmade daguerreotype camera built by Thomas is part of a private collection located in Ontario. Collodion Wet Plate Demonstrated by the many cabinet cards made at the Connon studio, it is likely Thomas Connon began working with the wet plate collodion process relatively early, before building his second studio. If you look closely at figure 47, you will see sample cartes de visite on display at the location where Thomas later operated his own general store. Tintype Found in collections at Library & Archives Canada, Archives of Ontario, and Wellington County Museum & Archives are a few tintypes attributed to the Connons, demonstrating their use of the collodion on iron process. Collodion Dry Plate There are a number of examples from the Connon collections that demonstrate their use of the dry plate process, including various sizes of glass plate negatives. Sensitized Bromide Paper Mentioned in letters from John Connon is the use of sensitized bromide paper to make negatives. He may have been making this himself, or purchasing it from George Eastman, who had sold sheets of the material while his company's  primary  focus  was  still  producing  dry  plates. Paper Negatives In figure 48 is  an  example  of  one  of  John  Connon's  early  panoramic   negatives, with its corresponding print, for which he used paper negative roll film, manufactured by George Eastman. Transparent Film John Connon began using Eastman transparent roll film as soon as it was released and noted the trouble he had attaining it early on. Figures 49 and 50 show two different sized panoramic negatives he made using the medium and two different cameras. 60

Observations of Panoramic Prints & Negatives John Connon used three different sizes of paper negatives and two different sizes of nitrocellulose negatives to make his panoramic photographs. Examples of these can be found in the collections of the Archives of Ontario, Wellington County Archives and Library & Archives Canada. The Wellington County Archives feature a number of large paper prints and negatives that are 3 inches, 4 Â¼ inches and 4 and Â¾ inches in size. In the textual records, John  noted  that  he  had  been  using  Eastman  film  thus  allowing  his  camera's  development to closely mirror that of the Eastman flexible films, from paper to cellulose nitrate film bases. Although Connon did not date his photographs, the 3-inch paper negative (see figure 29, page 33) from the Archives of Ontario matches his description of his first panoramic photograph. As it does not reach more than 150-degrees, and shows a vacant lot in the centre of Elora, it is indicated that this specific negative was therefore made using his first panoramic camera that was described as having a motion similar to a swinging hollow door (see Chapter 3). The larger paper negatives were likely made with the camera model which incorporated brass rollers shown in the earlier photographs, prior to the release of transparent roll film (see figure 48). The cellulose nitrate negatives examined measured 4 Â¾ inches and 2 Â¾ inches. The larger (see figure  49)  were  again  likely  used  with  John's  completed  camera  model  with  the  brass  rollers  (the  rollers   61

on the model were not flanged), or could have been made at a later date using a panoramic camera such as the Kodak Cirkut purchased after the death of his father. The smaller negatives, featuring a view of New York City (see figure 50), have been described by John Connon as being trimmed prior to exposure with the Wonder panoramic camera. Although the Wonder is also described for use with American Stripping Film, no preserved panoramic negatives matching this description have been found thus far.
