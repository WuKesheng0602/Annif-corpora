THE PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF STRUCTURALLY STABLE 5-COORDINATE POLYSTANNANES
Aman Ullah Khan, Molecular Science, Ryerson University, 2014

ABSTRACT
Tetraorganotin compounds [2-(MeOCH2)C6H4]SnR3 (R = Me, n-Bu, Ph) containing a C,Ochelating ligand were prepared in good yield from the reaction of the R 3SnCl and [2(MeOCH2)C6H4]Li. Tethered organotin compounds Ph3Sn(CH2)3OC6H4R (R = Ph, H, CF3, OCH3) were prepared in good yield from the hydrostannylation reactions of the corresponding vinyl ethers with Ph3SnH. Conversion of two organotin compounds to triorganotin chlorides and diorganotin chlorides, (Ph3-nClnSn(CH2)3OC6H4R; R = H, Ph: n = 1, 2), was successfully carried out and characterisation afforded by NMR spectroscopy. X-ray crystallographic studies revealed a tetrahedral geometry for the tetraorganotin Ph3Sn(CH2)3OC6H4CF3, while five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal structures with relatively short Sn-O (2.7-2.8 Å) interactions were observed for both mono- (Ph2ClSn(CH2)3OC6H4R; R = H, Ph) and dichloride (PhCl2Sn(CH2)3OC6H4R; R = H, Ph) species. Penta-coordinate diorganotin dichlorides containing a C,N- chelating ligand[2(Me2NCH2)C6H4]RSnCl2 (R = Me, n-Bu, Ph) or C,O- chelating ligand [2-(MeOCH2)C6H4]RSnCl2 (R = Me, n-Bu, Ph) were prepared by treating RSnCl3 with the lithiated salts [2(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li and [2-(MeOCH2)C6H4]Li respectively. Organotin chlorides were successfully reduced with LiAlH4 or NaBH4 to produce novel hydrides. Catalytic dehydrocoupling of diorganotin dihydrides to yield polystannanes was explored using a variety of dehydrocoupling catalysts such as Wilkinson's catalyst, Cp2ZrMe2 or TMEDA. In almost every instance this resulted in the formation of yellow coloured gummy polymeric materials of moderate molecular weights (Mw = 1 × 104 - 1 × 105 Da) and PDI's (1.3-2.0). The stability of polystannanes containing

tethered O or C,N- or C,O-chelating ligands was investigated in both solid and in solution using NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies. These studies revealed an enhanced stability to ambient light in the solid state and in solution in the dark when compared to known poly(dialkyl)stannanes.

1.0 Tin (Sn):
Tin is the oldest known metal in the periodic table. It has been used to increase the hardness of copper since 3500 BC and helped to start the Bronze Age. It was first isolated as a pure metal in 800 BC.1 Its abundance in the earth's surface is about 2 ppm, with Cassiterite, SnO2, the most important ore of tin. China and South East Asia produce 75% of the world's production of tin and  18% from South America.2 Tin is the first metallic element of Group 14 in the periodic table with atomic number 50, atomic mass 118.90 g/mol and a ground state valence shell electronic configuration 5s25p2. It has 10 stable isotopes which is the highest number for any element of the periodic table. Tin has three NMR active isotopes (115Sn, 117Sn and 119Sn) each with spin ½. More commonly
117

Sn (7.61%) and

119

Sn (8.58%) nuclei are used for NMR experiments due to their
119

relatively high natural abundance. For tin chemistry,

Sn NMR spectroscopy has become a

routine tool with NMR chemical shifts ranging from +4000 to -2500 ppm with the 119Sn resonance for SnMe4 assigned to  = 0 ppm.2 Tin most commonly exists in either a Sn(II) or Sn(IV) oxidation state with tetravalent structures preferred for most organotin compounds. The majority of organic and inorganic Sn(IV) compounds possess sp3 hybridization and adopt a tetrahedral structure, e.g. SnX4 (Figure 1). The coordination number at tin can be increased through hybridization to form 5and 6-coordinated complexes. These hybridized orbitals can accept electrons from ligands to form coordination geometries which are trigonal bipyramidal, TBP (SnX5) or octahedral, Oh (SnX6) respectively.

1.1 Organotin compounds:
In 1849, the first organotin compound, diethyltin diiodide, was synthesized by Frankland3 and shortly thereafter the first oligo- or polystannane was reported by Löwig in 1852.4 Löwig studied the reaction of iodoethane with Sn/K or Sn/Na alloys and obtained Et3SnH and Et3SnSnEt3. The development of organotin chemistry slowed for the next fifty years with only 37 papers published by 1900. Organotin chemistry was revolutionized shortly thereafter with the availability of organomagnesium halides as alkylating and arylating agents. These reagents were widely used to produce R4Sn type compounds. In 1903, Pope and Peachey described the synthesis of a number of tetraalkyl- and tetraarylstannanes by reacting a suitable Grignard reagent with SnCl4 or alkyltin halide.5 Kocheshkov discovered the redistribution reaction between R4Sn and SnCl4 in 1929 which afforded tri-, di- and mono-organostannyl chloride species.6 In 1936, Yngve discovered the heat stabilizing ability of organotins on polyvinyl chloride. In 1937, a summary of the early work of organotins was published in Organometallische Chemie by Krause and von Grosse.7

1.2 Hypervalent/ Hypercoordinate compounds:
In recent years, research interest in compounds with non-classical chemical bonds has increased extensively.8 These include the derivatives of silicon, germanium9-12 and tin.13,14 The expansion in the coordination sphere of these elements is caused by additional intra- or intermolecular coordination interactions. In the early 1960's it was demonstrated that organotin compounds have the ability to expand their coordination spheres.15,16 In 1969, the term "hypervalent" was introduced by Musher to explain the structure of compounds that required octet expansion for the central atom (e.g. PCl5, SiF6, etc.).17 The ions or molecules of the elements of Group 15-18 that possess more electrons than the octet within a valence shell are deemed

2

hypervalent.17 Compounds of elements from Groups 1, 2 or 14 as the central atom are also included in the family of hypervalent compounds. Hypervalent bonds in 5- or 6-coordinate compounds of Ge, Sn and Pb differ from the hypervalent bonds of S, P and Cl derivatives. In this case, the donor lone pair of Group 14 elements is supplied by the ligand as the central atom has no ns2 lone pair. The first structurally characterized pentacoordinated organotin compound was a PyMe3SnCl in 1963.18 In the last three decades, five (TBP, SP) and six (Oh) coordinated tin compounds have been extensively studied. Compounds of main group elements containing (N) electrons more than the octet in a valence shell associated with the central atom (E) directly bound to ligands (L) are known as hypervalent compounds. Therefore, the simple designation N-E-L is used to describe hypervalent molecules (Figure 2).18

Figure 2: The principle coordination geometries of 5- and 6-coordinate Sn compounds. The formation of hypervalent bonds containing a 5- and 6-coordinated central atom can be interpreted by two concepts; the d-orbital concept or the 3c-4e bond concept. 1. The d-orbital concept: According to this classical concept, filled s and p atomic orbitals along with vacant 5dorbitals are involved in bond formation and cause an increase in the coordination number from 4 to 5 or 6 for Group 14 containing species. Two electronic configurations are envisioned to hold additional electrons that exceed the octet within the valence shell; dsp3 or d2sp3.8 Sn has five vacant 5d AOs which could participate in the formation of penta- and hexacoordinate structures. However, computational studies have shown that the nd AOs of Group 14 atoms (Ge, Sn and Pb)

3

are too diffuse and too high in energy to participate in bonding8 (more detail provided in the 3c-4e bond concept: below). 2. 3c-4e bond concept: This concept excludes the contribution of 5d orbitals in hypervalent bonding for penta- and hexacoordinate structures. In 1951, Pimentel and Rundle proposed the idea of a 3c-4e bond using molecular orbital theory.20 A simple description of the 3c-4e bond model is the delocalization of one pair of bonding electrons to the two other substituents. The 3c-4e model suggests that ns2 orbitals of metal atom (E) could be used for bonding to equatorial ligands resulting in two-center bonds, while the npz orbital could interact with an appropriate orbital of the axial substituent (L) and a lone pair of the donor atom (N) to form a hypervalent, 3c-4e bond. Initially, the concept of 3c-4e bond was not readily adopted by researchers, but progress in computational studies and the efforts of Kutzelnigg et al.21 have made this idea generally acceptable today. The hypervalent bonding of molecules has also been investigated by von Schleyer et al.22 who concluded that the d-orbital concept is incorrect and these orbitals are not important in the acceptance of electrons beyond the octet. It has been determined that it is not possible for the d orbitals to hold extra electron density because of the high energy gap between n(sp) and nd, which makes the number of available metal orbitals deficient. From theoretical calculations, it has been established that in main group elements, participation of d orbitals for hybridization with s and p orbitals of third period and heavier is negligible. Therefore, a 3c-4e bond is an electron-rich bond and the nonbonding molecular orbital becomes the highest occupied orbital. In the 3c-4e bond, the central atom has less than four pairs of electrons in the valence shell and does not exceed the Lewis octet due to the distribution of extra electron density on to ligands or substituents. Figure 3 represents the simplest MO diagram of the 3c-4e bond.

Figure 3: The MO diagram of a (3c-4e) bond in hypervalent compounds. In Group 14, the hypervalency of both Sn and Si has been intensively studied in comparison to Ge, with even fewer studies for compounds of Pb. In a pentacoordinated TBP molecule, the hypervalent bond is typically seen in the axial position. Four methods were proposed by Akiba8 to construct a 3c-4e bond of a pentacoordinated molecule experimentally (Figure 4); a) add two free radicals to coordinate with a pair of unshared electrons in a p orbital, b) add two pairs of unshared electrons to coordinate a vacant p orbital, c) add a pair of unshared electrons to coordinate with * orbital of E-X bond (e.g., sulphonium, phosphonium etc.), d) add a pair of unshared electrons to coordinate with the * orbital of E-X bond of a neutral molecule (e.g., Si and Sn).

Figure 4: Proposed methods to make (3c-4e) bonds.8

Hypervalent bonds are favourably formed when these conditions are present: 1. The electronegativity of the ligands is typically higher than the central E atom. 2. For trigonal bipyramidal molecules, ligands having higher electronegativity form the hypervalent bond with central atom E and tend to occupy axial positions. 3. The E-L bonds are longer in penta- and hexacoordinate compounds than in tetrahedral molecules.

1.3 Hypervalent/ Hypercoordinate compounds of Group 14:
1.3.1 Hypercoordinate organotin compounds containing C,N-chelating ligands: Hypervalent compounds of organotin derivatives with ligands containing an intramolecular Sn-N interaction have been known since 1960.23 These tin species have been extensively studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR (1H, 13C, 119Sn) spectroscopy. The strength of the SnN interaction can be inferred from the bond distance; the smaller the distance, the stronger the donor-acceptor interaction. It is also observed that as the Sn-N distance decreases, the Sn-X (X = F, Cl, Br, I) bond becomes longer. This is consistent with the model shown in Figure 4(d). The
119

Sn NMR spectra of hypervalent triorganotin(IV) compounds exhibit a single resonance for the

central tin atom, shifted up-field with respect to a structurally similar non-hypervalent analog. Organotin(IV) compounds possessing the 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4- organic ligand with nitrogen as donor atom or other related potentially chelating organic ligands have been extensively investigated both in solution and in the solid state. Interest in these types of organotin compounds has been largely due to their unusual structural properties14,24 and potential biological uses.25 The different types of organotin compounds utilizing the 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4- ligand can be classified as mono-, di-, tri- and tetraorganotin(IV) compounds.

1.3.1.1 Tetraorganotin compounds containing C,N-chelating ligands: The more commonly used C,N-chelating ligands are shown in Figure 5. Ligands i-iv and vii can form five membered hypervalent compounds while v and vi form six membered chelate rings.26

Figure 5: Most commonly used C,N-chelating ligands. The important structural feature of these ligands is that the Sn-N intramolecular coordination results in an increase of the coordination number at tin from 4 to 5 or 6 for i to iv and v to vi respectively. Organotin compounds containing these ligands can be synthesized by heteroatom facilitated ortho-lithiation followed by reaction with organotin halides. Jastrzebski et al.27 reported the synthesis of 8-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthyl lithium etherate by reacting the equimolar amount of 1-(dimethylamino)naphthalene with n-BuLi in Et2O. The 8-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthyl lithium etherate was treated with Me3MCl (M = Si, Sn) to obtain the corresponding Group 14 derivatives. Reaction of 8-(dimethylamino)-l-naphthyl lithium with Me3SnCl or Ph3SnCl afforded high yields of 8-(dimethylamino)-l-naphthyltrimethyltin and 8-(dimethylamino)-l-

naphthyltriphenyltin, respectively (Scheme 1).28 Tetraorganotin compounds were initially
7

considered as unlikely to extend their coordination number due to the poor acceptor properties of these tin centers.14

Figure 6: Tetraorganotin compounds. NMR (1H,
13

C,

119

Sn) spectroscopic studies have provided information concerning the

structure of tin compounds with C,N-chelating ligands in solution. These studies indicate that the
119

Sn NMR chemical shift of such compounds is strongly dependent on the type of substituent and

coordination number of tin.14 In compounds 1-5, the stable geometry of the 8-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthyl group ensures a Sn-N coordination bond. An X-ray structure of 2 reveals tin in TBP geometry with the N atom and one of the phenyl rings at axial positions.28 The 119Sn chemical shifts of compounds 1-4 show that the replacement of methyl by phenyl groups enhances the up-field shift of Sn resonances due
8

to an increasing Sn-N interaction. A significant upfield shift of the 119Sn resonance for 6 compared to the unsubstituted analogue Me3SnPh is likely due to the presence of a Sn-N intramolecular interaction.

Sn NMR chemical shifts of tin compounds containing a C,N-ligand

and their unsubstituted analogues given in Table 1 indicate that compounds 9-10 (Figure 6) have no apparent intramolecular interaction between Sn and N as there is only a slight upfield shift in their resonances compared to their unsubstituted analogues. A possible reason for the absence of an intramolecular interaction, particularly in compound 10, is due to the energetically favourable structure having a bulky SnR3 substituent perpendicular to the plane of aryl ring, keeping the tin atom away from the potential donor atoms. 1.3.1.1a Solution Structure of tetraorganotin compounds 1, 3-5: The relatively small 52 Hz 2J117/119Sn-1H coupling values for the methyl protons present in compounds 1, 3-5 are indicative of a tetrahedral geometry at tin.30-33 The presence of two resonances for the -NMe2 group in 5 containing a stable chiral center suggest a blockage of
9

pyramidal inversion at nitrogen, and may be a result of strong Sn-N coordination or steric considerations. The 1H and 13C chemical shift values of the -NMe2 in compounds 1-5 are relatively insensitive to Sn-N coordination. The methyl groups of -NMe2 in these compounds have
13

C

chemical resonances at  48 ppm, very close to that of the free 1-(dimethylamino)naphthalene (46.2 ppm). A small upfield shift of 2.2 ppm results with the substitution of phenyl for methyl at the tin center.32 1.3.1.2 Synthesis of organotin halides containing C,N-chelating ligands: Organotin halides have been synthesized by a variety of methods. The most commonly used method is the conversion of alkyl or aryl halides into Grignard reagents in THF or Et2O and their subsequent reaction with SnCl4 to produce tetraorganotin compounds. Tri- and diorganotin compounds can be synthesized by the comproportionation (or Kocheskov redistribution) reactions of tetraorganotin compounds with SnCl4 (Scheme 2).42

Scheme 2: Synthesis of organotin halides. The R2SnCl2 species are more conveniently accessed using the Kocheskov equilibrium (Scheme 2). During this reaction RSnCl3 is produced as an intermediate which immediately reacts with a tetraorganotin species to produce a diorganotin dihalide. Different techniques were reported to obtain pure tetraorganotin compounds. Caseri et al. used a 5% HCl solution for tetraalkyltin compounds40 and saturated solution of NH4Cl for tetraaryltin compounds.41 Uhlig et al. purified tetraaryltin compounds by filtration of reaction mixtures through celite and extraction of the
10

residues with DCM.42 Deacon et al. prepared diorganotin dihalides by reacting tetraorganotin compounds with a stoichiometric solution of Br2 or I2 in CHCl3. The halobenzene by-product was removed by prolonged drying under reduced pressure.43 Hypercoordinated diorganotin halides containing C,N-chelated ligands can be synthesized by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li with RnSnCl4-n (R = L, Me, n-Bu, Ph) under inert atmosphere. Another method for the synthesis of diorganotin halides is the solvent-free ligand redistribution reaction between [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Sn and SnCl4. These may also be synthesized from the direct reaction of [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li and SnCl4 (Scheme 3).49

Scheme 3: Routes for the synthesis of hypercoordinated organotin halides. 1.3.1.3 Triorganotin halides containing C,N-chelating ligands: There are a number of triorganotin halides (Figure 7) containing C,N-chelating ligands such as 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4-. The presence of a Sn-N intramolecular interaction in these species has been established by crystallography44 and 119Sn CP-MAS NMR45 (Cross Polarization-Magic Angle spinning) techniques in the solid state as well as by solution multinuclear NMR spectroscopy.29b,46

Figure 7: 5-coordinate triorganotin halides. 1.3.1.3a Synthesis:

Scheme 4: Synthesis of compounds 12a and 12c.47 van Koten et al. prepared compounds 12a and 12c by treating the [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Cu tetramer with diorganotin dihalides (Scheme 4).47 Compounds 13 and 14 were prepared by lithiation of 2-Me2NCH(R)C6H5 with t-BuLi. Compounds 15 and 16 were synthesized by lithium/halogen exchange reactions of 2-Me2NCH(R)C6H5 (R = isopropyl, t-butyl) with n-BuLi because the presence of bulky substituents greatly reduces accessibility to the ortho site. The

12

reaction of SnBr2Me2, SnBr2MePh, SnBr2Ph2 with the lithiated species afforded hypervalent compounds 13(a-c) and 16(a-c) as white coloured crystalline solids (Scheme 5).56a

Scheme 5: Synthesis of 13(a-c) and 16(a-c).28 Compounds 17, 18 and 19 were previously reported by both Rippstein et al.48 and Varga et al.49 and were synthesized by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li with their respective diorganotin dihalides. Alternatively, 17 was obtained by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li with a solution of SnMePhBr2 in Et2O.50 Compounds 2151, 2252, and 3248,29a were synthesized from the reactions of a 1:1 of n-Bu2SnCl2, t-Bu2SnCl2 and 1:2 ratio of PhSnCl3 with [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li in C6H6 at room temperature. Compound 23 was prepared by reacting Me2SnBr2 with [2-

(Et2NCH2)C6H4]Li.53 1.3.1.3b Structural studies: The x-ray crystal structure determination of [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]SnPh2Br 12c reveals a five-coordinate distorted TBP geometry at the tin center, with three carbon ligands, including the built-in ligand and the bromine atom in equatorial and axial positions, respectively. A N-Sn-Br bond angle of 171º and Sn-N bond length of 2.51 Å was observed for 12c. The Sn-N bond distance may be the result of a balance between the inherent Sn-N bond strength and the skeletal strain in the five-membered chelate ring.54 These observations provide evidence of an intramolecular interaction between Sn and N.

13

The configurational stability of the triorganotin bromides having either the tin center (Figure 7) (R' R", 12b and 24b), or the benzyl carbon atom (R  H) or both (12b-16b) as chiral centers were investigated extensively by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.47,50,56a Tin compounds 25 and 26 have a six-membered chelate ring where the tin centers have configurational stability only at low temperature (below 0 ºC),50 while triorganotin bromides having a flexible five-membered chelate ring (13b-16b, 17 and 24b) are considerably more stable on the NMR time scale (up to 130 ºC). These fluxional processes were studied by the 1H NMR of 12b at variable temperatures. The diastereotopicity of the methyl protons of the -NMe2 group was observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy at low temperature, indicating the inertness of Sn-N coordination on the NMR time scale. At higher temperature, the -NMe2 resonances coalesce due to the process of Sn-N dissociation/association. The process (Figure 8) by which -NMe2 methyl groups become homotopic consists of four steps including Sn-N dissociation, rotation around the Cbenzyl-N bond, pyramidal inversion at nitrogen and finally Sn-N association. On the NMR time scale this process is quite fast above 0 ºC.
32,33,54,55,56a

Finally, it was found that the tin center has configurational

stability up to 130 ºC on the NMR time scale in triorganotin bromides having a rigid fivemembered chelate ring (28, 30, 31).27 The 1H NMR analysis of 25 and 26 containing a sixmembered chelate ring reveal the existence of both the process of dissociation/association and inversion of configuration at tin centers.50 The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 26 at -40 ºC showed an AB pattern for both benzylic -CH2 groups and two resonances for -NMe2 group. This indicates the stability of the Sn-N interaction and configuration of tin on the NMR time scale. At -30 ºC, it was observed that -NMe2 resonances coalesce, with no change of the AB pattern up to 0 ºC. This suggests that on NMR time scale, only the Sn-N dissociation/association process becomes

14

rapid. Above 0 ºC, the coalescence of the two AB patterns to two singlets show that inversion of configuration at tin centers is rapid.50

Figure 8: Two basic fluxional processes of a C,N-chelating ligand containing R3SnCl.

Scheme 6: Diastereoisomers of 13b-16b. Compounds 13b-16b possess two chiral centres; one at the benzylic carbon and one at the tin atom. NMR (1H and 119Sn) spectroscopy indicate the presence of two different diastereoisomers for 13b-15b and a single isomer for 16b as shown in Scheme 6. The coordination geometry at the tin atoms of compounds 21 and 22 is trigonal bipyramidal having the carbon atoms and more electronegative atoms (N, Cl) at equatorial and axial positions respectively. The Sn-N bond distance in 22 is 2.904(14) Å which is significantly longer than in 21 (2.510(5) Å) and other known triorganotin compounds. The downfield
119

Sn NMR resonance of 18.5 ppm for 22 is in contrast

with the resonances of similar types of 5-coordinate compounds with strong Sn-N interactions such as LSn(n-Bu)2Cl ( = -51.7 ppm), LSn(n-Bu)2F ( = -77.1 ppm), LSn(t-Bu)2F ( = -92.1 ppm), LSnMe2F ( = -53.8 ppm) where L = 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4-. Variable temperature (VT) 1H and 119Sn NMR studies of 22 in different solvents and in the solid state concluded that its geometry is distorted trigonal pyramidal, but with a significantly weaker Sn-N interaction.52

15

The geometry of 32 can be explained in two different ways. It may be a prototypical distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry for organotin having a C,N-chelating ligand located in equatorial positions where both the chlorine and nitrogen atoms are in axial positions. Here the non-coordinated nitrogen atom lies out of the tin coordination sphere and does not coordinate to tin (Sn­N1 and Sn-N2 distances at 2.4752(17) and 3.5174(19) Å respectively). Alternatively, it may be regarded as a distorted octahedron, with C1 and C10, N1 and Cl1, and N2 and C19 in mutual pseudo trans positions. The Sn­N1 and Sn-N2 distances are 2.5345(18) and 3.2736(19) Å for the second molecule and the bond angle between C1-Sn-C10 in these molecules is 130.66º and 134.15º instead of 180º. The asymmetric crystal unit cell of 32 show two independent molecules having small differences in some bond distances and angles.29a Triorganotin compounds tend to favour pentacoordination in the presence of donor molecules due to the increased Lewis acidity of tin. Compounds in Figure 7 contain a potentially intramolecularly coordinating C,N-chelating ligand capable of forming a five membered chelate ring. The tin center in these compounds has TBP geometry having the carbon ligands at equatorial sites and the more electronegative nitrogen and halogen atoms at axial positions. NMR (1H, 13C and 119Sn) studies of these compounds suggest that they have same structure in both the solid state and in solution. However, fluxional processes become more frequent at higher temperature on the NMR time scale.

H NMR spectra of compounds 13b-13d, 14b-14d, 15b-15d and 16b-16d reveal a TBP

structure for tin, where the C-ligands occupy equatorial positions and the N an axial position. For compounds 13b-15b, two distinct patterns were observed in their 1H NMR spectra indicative of two diastereoisomers. These observations are supported by the presence of a chiral center in these molecules. The 2J117-119Sn-1H coupling of 65 Hz for triorganotin bromides 13b-16b and 13a-16a having one and two methyl groups bonded to tin also confirm the TBP geometry.56a The
119

Sn NMR data for trioganotin halides (Table 2) suggest that the formation of
119

pentacoordinated species results in a relatively large upfield shift of

Sn NMR resonance

17

compared to similar four coordinate tin species. For example, the 119Sn NMR resonance for 12c16c range from  = -105 to -145 ppm compared to  = -60 ppm for Ph3SnBr.56b The upfield shift of 119Sn resonances is also consistent with the substitution of methyl for phenyl groups. The 119Sn chemical shifts of triorganotin halides in these studies are independent of temperature (between 80 to 100 ºC) suggesting that even in the presence of fluxional process involving Sn-N dissociation-association observable by 1H and
13

C NMR spectroscopy, the Sn center retains its
119

pentacoordinated geometry. Two well resolved

Sn resonances were also observed for

compounds 13c-16c indicative of the existence of two diastereoisomers. The VT
119

Sn NMR of 25 and 26 indicate a strong temperature dependence, with an
119

increasing downfield shift observed with increasing temperature. A significant

Sn NMR

chemical shift variation was observed for 25 and 26 from -49.4 ppm and -131.1 ppm at -85 ºC to -6.2 ppm and -72.0 ppm at 100 ºC, respectively. This downfield shift may be due to the predominance of tetrahedral coordination geometry for the tin centres at the higher temperature. The five membered ring in compounds 12-24 and 27-31 are more flexible than in 25 and 26 and this increased flexibility may promote Sn-N dissociation, resulting in tetracoordinate tin species and a downfield shift of the 119Sn NMR resonance. 1.3.1.4 Diorganotin dihalides containing C,N-chelating ligands:

1.3.1.4a Synthesis: Diorganotin(IV) dihalides 33, 35 and 37 are compounds of interest in this thesis as they can be used directly or after modification to dihydrides as potential monomers. van Koten et al.59 synthesized compounds 33 and 35 by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]4Cu4 with MeSnCl3 and PhSnCl3 respectively in C6H6 at room temperature. Rippstein et al.48 prepared 35 from the reaction of [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li with PhSnCl3 in Et2O and purified by toluene extraction. Novák et al.29a reacted the [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li salt with PhSnCl3 in C6H6 to prepare 35. Varga et al.51 synthesized compound 37 by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li with n-BuSnCl3 in C6H6 and purified the product by extraction with hot petroleum ether. Compound 38 was obtained by reacting compound 37 with KF in MeOH at room temperature. Compounds 42 and 44 were also synthesized by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li with SnX4 (X = Cl, I) in a 2:1 ratio. 1.3.1.4b Structural studies: In compounds 35 and 37 the distance between Sn-N is 2.444(5) Å and 2.458(5) Å respectively. These hypercoordinated molecules have a 3c-4e trans configuration ((N(1)-Sn(1)Cl(1) = 168.15º(12), 171.61º(15) respectively) that contribute to a strong intramolecular Sn-N interaction. The molecules possess a distorted TBP (C,N-)CSnCl2 core (hypervalent 10-Sn-5).29a,51 Compounds 35 and 37 share two common features in their molecular structures;41 a strong coordination between the Sn and N atoms of the pendant Me2NCH2 arm that result in an increase in the coordination number at tin, and the SnC3N ring folded along Sn(1)--CH2 atoms. The tin atoms in compounds 42 and 44 are bound to two L groups (L = 2(Me2NCH2)C6H4)) and two cis-bonded halides (Cl, I) with the molecules possessing pseudo octahedral geometry. The C-Sn-C bond angle for 42 and 44 are 152.47º(7) and 157.97º(11) respectively, whereas the ideal bond angle for octahedral geometry is 180º. Similarly, the N-Sn-N

19

angles are 108.47º(4) for 42 and 103.65º(7) for 44 compared to the ideal 90º. Comparatively large Sn-N distances of 2.6179(13) Å for 42, and 2.537(2) Å and 2.648(2) Å for 44 were observed.

The 119Sn NMR chemical shift data of pentacoordinated diorganotin dihalides 33 ( = -94.0 ppm), 34 ( = -141.4 ppm), and the triorganotin halide 12a ( = -50.0 ppm) show an upfield shift relative to their 4-coordinate analogues. Substitution of the Cl in 33 with Br in 34 produced a downfield shift of about 50 ppm. A similar trend was observed for the diorganotin dihalide 37 (119Sn  = -104.3 ppm) and triorganotin halide 20 ( = -44.9 ppm). 1.3.1.5 Monoorganotin trihalides containing C,N-chelating ligands:

Figure 10: Monoorganotin halides.61 Compounds 45-47 were obtained in low yields from the reaction of a 1:1 ratio of LLi and SnX4 (L = [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li, X = Cl, Br, I). A strong intramolecular Sn-N interaction in the hypervalent compounds 45-47 was observed from an up-field shift of the 119Sn resonances ( = -

227.4, -408 (broad), and -944.4 ppm)61 compared to the trihalophenyl compounds, PhSnX3 ( = -61.3, -227.2 and -699.9 ppm).62 The Lewis acidity of the tin atom decreases with the lower electronegativity of X which is evident from the 3J119Sn-1H coupling constant for 45-47 (132.0, 128.6 and 126.2 Hz). A distorted TBP geometry is observed in all compounds and the bond distance of the Sn-N dative interaction in 45-47 is 2.380(2), 2.402(3) and 2.436(4) Å, respectively. A slight increase in the Sn-N bond distance going from 45 to 47 is related to the relative electronegativities and sizes of X.61 Data obtained for organotin compounds containing C,N-chelating ligands in noncoordinating apolar solvents indicate the existence of intramolecular Sn-N donor-acceptor interactions of variable strength. It increases with the decreasing number of organic substituents at the tin center.27b The 119Sn NMR data of 45-47 show the influence of additional coordination on chemical shift, which is relatively minor in the case of tetraorganotin compounds, but results in large upfield shifts for triorganotin halides and diorganotin dihalides.26 1.3.2 Organotin hydrides containing C,N-chelating ligands: The preparation of organotin hydrides was first reported by Kraus and Geer in 1922 by reacting Me3SnNa with HCl in liquid ammonia.63 A revolution in the synthesis of tin hydrides occured in 1947 when Finholt et al. reported a convenient method to reduce organotin chlorides with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4).64 Afterwards, this method was successfully used for the synthesis of RnSnH4-n. The most frequently used methods for the preparation of organotin hydrides involve reducing agents such as silicon, lithium and boron hydrides. Some other methods such as thermal decomposition of organotin formates, hydrolysis of stannyl metallic compounds and ligand exchange between organotin compounds are less commonly used.65

21

Scheme 7: The preparation of organotin hydrides.65 Organotin hydrides with chelating ligands containing donor atoms such as N, P or O atom have received increasing attention in recent years due to their unusual structural properties as well as their industrial and pharmacological applications.74,75 The donor-acceptor interaction between Sn and the donor atom of the ligand is the most interesting aspect of these molecules. Surprisingly, there are few examples of hydrides having Sn-N intramolecular interactions reported in literature.66-72 These donor-acceptor interactions have been confirmed by various techniques such as X-ray crystallogaphy76 and NMR spectroscopy.66-72, 76 1.3.2.1 Triorganotin hydrides containing C,N-chelating ligands:

Figure 11: Triorganotin hydrides. 1.3.2.1a Synthesis: Turek et al.66 prepared triorganotin hydrides 48-50 by reacting [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]R2SnX (R = Ph, n-Bu, t-Bu and X = Cl) with K(BEt3)H in a 1:1 ratio in THF at -20º C and stirring at room temperature for 5 days. These hydrides show typical 1H NMR (C6D6) hydride resonances at 6.98, 5.83 and 6.01 ppm for 48, 49 and 50 respectively. Compound 51 was prepared from the reaction
22

of [2-[(Me2NCH2)C6H4]SnMe2Br or the analogous chloride with LiAlH4 in THF.67 Compound 52 was prepared by treating the 2-[(Me2NCHMe)C6H4-] ligand containing triorganotin monohalides with NaBH4 in EtOH, as LiAlH4 was found to decompose the halide. Hydrides 53-56 were also obtained by treating the corresponding chlorides with LiAlH4.68 1.3.2.1b Structural studies: For triorganotin hydrides the 1H NMR resonance for the proton directly bonded to the tin atom varies between 4.5-7.5 ppm.65 The presence of a 117/119Sn couplings is a characteristic feature in 1H NMR spectra of these compounds. The magnitude of this coupling is dependent on substituents bonded to tin. Tin hydrides which contain bulky alkyl groups have relatively smaller values of 1J117/119Sn-1H whereas tin hydrides containing aromatic rings cause an increase in
1

J117/119Sn-1H coupling. The characteristic changes of the NMR chemical shifts for Sn and N and the

values of coupling constants of J117/119Sn-13C and J117/119Sn-15N support the existence of substantive donor-acceptor interactions. Examples of tin hydrides having a donor-acceptor interaction between Sn and N include the triorganotin hydrides with 2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)phenyl and 2-(4isopropyl-2-oxazolinyl)-5-phenyl substituents77,78 and diorganotin dihydrides containing 2-(4isopropyl-2-oxazolinyl)-5-phenyl as chelating ligands and phenyl, methyl, n-butyl and t-butyl substituents (Figure 13).66,69 For hypercoordinated tin hydrides 60-62 as shown in Figure 13, the Sn-N interaction is evident from the increase in the value of coupling constants. A comparison of 1J117/119Sn-1H coupling between tetravalent compound 57, 58, and 59 and pentavalent 60, 61 and 62 show the difference in the nature of substituents bound to tin (Table 4).65,70

Unfortunately, X-ray structures of these low melting hydrides have not yet been reported. There is only one example of a triorganotin hydride, 54, which has been structurally determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure of 54 revealed the presence of both epimers in 1:1 ratio. The coordination geometry of 54 is a monocapped tetrahedron having only a weak Sn-N interaction; evident from the very long Sn-N distances of 2.931(3) and 2.885(3) Å in this molecule.

25

atoms directly bonded to tin. The comparison of 1J117/119Sn-1H coupling constants of coordinated hydrides for 69 and 70 and noncoordinated analogues PhMeSnH2 and Ph2SnH2 provides evidence that Sn-N interaction/coordination can cause both a strong decrease and increase of 1J117/119Sn-1H coupling constant for 69 and negligible/strong coupling increase for 70 (Table 5). The effect of temperature 1J117/119Sn-1H on coupling constants for these species were also investigated. It was concluded that the variation in the values of coupling constants at different temperatures may be due to the axial/equatorial positions of hydrogen atoms; one is axial and one is equatorial in 69 and both are equatorial in 70.

1.3.3 Si, Ge and Pb compounds containing a C,N-chelating ligand: Hypervalent silicon compounds (Figure 15) have been known since the beginning of 19th century.77 Boyer et al.78 prepared and characterized a number of these compounds, including 72, 81, 94 and 96 which were structurally studied by both X-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy. The geometry of these hypercoordinated silicon compounds was exclusively distorted TBP having the nitrogen atom at an axial position. Five- and six-membered chelate rings were formed in case of 81, 94 and 97 respectively. Here the five-membered rings remain planar whereas the six-membered ring, such as 97, folds about the Si-CH2 group axis. The naphthyl group in 81 and the phenyl group in 94 and 97 occupy the second axial position of the TBP complexes.
26

Equatorial sites of TBP geometry were occupied by two hydrogen atoms in 81 and 94, whereas one hydrogen atom and one methyl group are found in 97. A comparison of the geometries of 98be (Figure 16) by X-ray diffraction revealed intramolecular coordination between the donor nitrogen atom and silicon center, resulting in five coordinate geometries.

Figure 15: Si compounds containing a C,N-chelating ligand. In most of these hypervalent compounds the axial positions are occupied by the donor atom with the halogen or hydride located in a trans configuration. The distance between donor and acceptor is significantly longer than a normal single bond distance between these two atoms. In
27

the case of 98e, the distance between the datively bonded Si and N atoms is 2.03 Å, whereas length of covalent bond between these atoms is 1.77 Å.

Si NMR spectroscopy is a useful technique to confirm the coordination between the donor

atom of the ligand and the silicon atom in solution which is evident by a substantial upfield shift of 29Si resonance. Table 6 lists a comparison of 29Si chemical shift of the coordinated silanes and their analogues.
19

F NMR resonances of Si-F groups and the 1H NMR chemical shift of groups

directly bound to the donor atom of the ligand were also useful in probing these interactions. 19F NMR spectra of compounds 72 and 93 (collected at 30 ºC) as well as 96 (collected at 80 ºC) showed sharp resonance at  = -142.5, -138.0 and -140.7 ppm respectively. On lowering temperature, these compounds showed a downfield triplet and up-field doublet which indicated that the F atoms occupy one axial and two equatorial positions. X-ray crystal structural analysis of 72 also confirmed its TBP geometry.80

28

Scheme 8: Synthesis of organosilanes containing C,N-chelating ligands.82 Kelbe et al. synthesized compounds 99-101 along with the known compounds 72 and 83 according to Scheme 8. The
19

F NMR spectra of fluorosilanes 72 and 83 were obtained at low

temperature in non-polar media. Compound 72 showed two peaks of equal intensity (Fa  = -111 ppm; Fe  = -154 ppm), while the 19F NMR spectrum of 83 displayed a triplet and a doublet in a 1:2 relative intensity (Fa  = -128 ppm; Fe  = -148 ppm) in good agreement with a TBP geometry (having two equatorial and an apical F atoms).81

Figure 17: Hypercoordinate organogermanium and organolead compounds.81,84,85 Krause and Reissaus77 reported the synthesis of the first diaryl lead compounds as monomeric species in 1922, but this work could not be reproduced despite attempts by several groups.87-90 Compound 106 was synthesized by De Wit et al.84 by reacting PbCl2 with two equivalents of [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Li in THF at -50 °C. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 106, the
3

J207Pb-1H and 4J207Pb-1H coupling constants for Ar-H and benzylic-CH2, respectively were detected.

29

The Pb-N interaction is suggested by the presence of a coupling (2J207Pb-13C = 28 Hz) between lead and the carbon atoms of the -N(CH3)2 group.

Scheme 9: Synthesis of organolead compounds.84 Compounds 104-105 and 107-111 were synthesized by Christea et al.85 by treating [2(R2NCH2)C6H4]Li with tri- and diorganolead chlorides followed by reaction with I2 and KI respectively. These compounds were characterized by NMR (1H,
13

C) spectroscopy, but

unfortunately no 207Pb NMR data is available. A crystallographic study of 108 and 110 revealed TBP geometry around the Pb atom and the presence of a Pb-N intramolecular interaction. The distance between Pb and N atoms is 3.051º(9) for 108 and 2.636º(8), 2.646º(9) Å for two distinct molecules of 110 in the unit cell. The bond angle between N-Pb-C for 108 and Cl-Pb-N (10-Pb-5) for 110 is 169.1º(3) and 166.11º(19), 167.2º(2) respectively. In the case of compound 108, the axial positions are occupied by N and the C atom of one of the phenyl groups while equatorial positions were occupied by carbons of the two other phenyl groups and pendant ligand. The Pb-N interaction is much stronger in the case of compound 110 having a Cl atom trans to N with Pb as the central atom. In both compounds the C3PbN ring is not planar, thus creating planar chirality. The cleavage of the bond between Pb and phenyl carbon was preferred over cleavage of the Pb and pendant group C, which provides additional evidence to support the intramolecular interaction
30

between Pb and N. These results suggest that in general, the geometry of pentacoordinated compounds containing later Group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn and Pb) is almost exclusively TBP.

1.4 Organotin compounds containing C,O-chelating ligands:
Hypervalent compounds of tin are of general interest because of their useful biological activity, reactivity and important industrial and agricultural applications.91-93 Most compounds having a Sn-O intramolecular interaction are those containing chelating ligands called "Pincer" ligands. There are several publications which report compounds containing C,O-chelating ligands. A variety of tin complexes with C,O-ligands are shown in Figure 18, 19.

1.4.1 Synthesis: In 1950, Gilman et al.84 reported the synthesis of 112 by reacting [o-MeOCH2C6H4]MgBr with Ph3SnCl which was characterized only by melting point. Compound 113 reported by Reich

31

et al.95 was prepared by treating [2-(Me2OCH2)C6H4]Li with Me3SnCl in THF. Compound 114 was synthesized by reacting [2-(Me2OCH2)C6H4]Cu with Me2SnBr2 while 116-118 were reported by Pannell et al.96 The synthesis of 11596 and 116 was carried out by reacting the oMeOC6H4CH2MgCl Grignard reagent and Me3SnCl or Ph3SnCl respectively, while 117 and 118 were obtained by successive replacement of the phenyl groups in 116 and 117 with chloride by treatment with a solution of HCl/Et2O in C6H6. Compounds 119-132 were reported by Jambor et al.92,98 and were obtained by reacting the lithiated ligands with the respective halides at low temperature in hexane. 1.4.2 Structural studies: The X-ray crystallographic data for compounds 116-118 were also reported. It was found that there was a distinctive decrease in Sn-O distance with replacement of the phenyl groups bound to tin with Cl. The substitution of one of the phenyl groups of 116 with Cl reduces the Sn-O bond distance from 3.07 to 2.77 Å. This is likely due to the increase in the Lewis acidity of the central tin atom and the transition from tetrahedral to TBP geometry. Compound 118 exhibited intermolecular interactions via Sn-Cl resulting in dimer formation and had pseudo-Oh geometry. A comparison of chemical shift values by solid state and solution indicated only minor difference.

The 119Sn chemical shifts and Sn-O bond distances of organotin compounds containing C,O-chelating ligands are listed in Table 7. Interestingly, one Sn-O distance in 124 was 2.454(1) Å, while the second Sn-O distance is 3.473(1) Å, indicating that the second interaction is out of the tin coordination sphere.98 There are only a few literature examples of tetraorganostannanes having mesogenic substituents on the tin which can expand their valence shell by additional coordination or intramolecular interactions between the electronegative O donor atom and tin atom.

Compounds 141-145 were treated with molecular halogens (Br2 and I2) to produce the tin dihalides 146-150. The distance of organotin compounds 133-150 are listed in Table 8.

The crystal structure of 134 revealed a hexacoordinated tin atom bonded to two atoms of each of C, Cl and O (Figure 21). The two O and Cl atoms are cis to each other and the C atoms are found to occupy axial positions. The Sn-O distances in 134 are 2.553(2) and 2.540(2) Å respectively and are larger than the covalent radii of Sn and O (2.1 Å), but shorter than sum of their van der Waal's radii (3.7 Å).

Figure 21: Structure of 134.99 X-ray structure data for compounds 142 and 144 reveal tetrahedral geometries at tin centers having bond angles between 105-113º. Compound 146 exists in a dimeric form and two molecules are linked through Br(1)----Sn(1') and an octahedral sphere was completed by chelation of the ether O with a Sn(1)-O(1) distance 2.734(4) Å. Generally, the Sn-O distance is longer (2.540 2.667 Å)99,100 for diorganotin species with CN = 6 than those with CN = 5 (2.382 ­ 2.448 Å)101.
35

The Sn-O distance is also affected by the presence of an additional electronegative atom which increases the Lewis acidity of tin. In the case of 148, the Sn-O distance is transoid to Sn-Br bond with an angle of O(1)-Sn(1)-Br(1) = 169.0º(1) with the molecule assuming a TBP structure.43 Compounds 151-154 were synthesized by Takeuchi et al. using Scheme 11.102 The line width for germanium compounds were also determined and a broadening of signal was always accompanied by hypervalency. The 73Ge shift for compounds 151-153 are -85.0, -85.0 and -84.0 ppm (Ph3GeH  = -57.0 ppm) with the line widths of 350 Hz. An X-ray crystal structure determination revealed that Ge-O distances for 153 were 3.2773(3), 3.214(3) and 3.703(3) Å. Both crystal structure and NMR data gave evidence for a dative interaction between Ge and O, although it is weaker than between Ge and N.

1.5 C,S-chelating ligands containing compounds of Group 14:

Figure 22: C,S-chelating ligands.

36

C,S-chelating ligands commonly used to hypercoordinate a Group 14 element are listed in Figure 22. There are only a few reports of hypercoordinated Sn-S compounds. Ligands of type xii (R = n- Pr, Ph) were synthesized using the methods reported in the literature.103-105 It is well established that Group 14 elements have the ability to expand their coordination number through dative interactions of Lewis bases of functional groups containing N, P, S and O donor atom).95 This strategy was used to produce a variety of hypercoordinated compounds of Sn.

Figure 23: Group 14 compounds containing C,S-chelating ligands. Compound 155 was successfully prepared by using methods shown in Scheme 12. An insitu synthesis of the respective Grignard reagent in the presence of the halide afforded the desired product in a good yield.96 Two phenyl groups were subsequently substituted with Cl by reacting 155 and 156 with of HCl/Et2O in C6H6 to produce the dihalides 156-157 respectively. Compounds 155 and 158-160 were synthesized by reacting Group 14 halides with Li metal followed by reaction with o-(SCH3C6H4)CH2Cl at low temperature (Scheme 12).106

37

The reaction of thiols and NaH followed by the reaction with 1-bromo-2bromomethylbenzene produced the corresponding sulfides 162-164 in good yields (Scheme 13). Lithiation of 162-164 with n-BuLi in Et2O at 0 ºC followed by treatment with SiHCl3 and the subsequent reduction with LiAlH4 afforded silicon dihydrides 165-167. Compounds 170-172 were reported by Berlekamp and synthesized according to Scheme 14.107 Compounds 173-174 were synthesized by Takeuchi et al. using Scheme 15.102

119

Sn NMR data of compound 155 showed an upfield shift of 70.5 ppm relative to the non-

chelating, structurally similar analog, suggestive of substantial S-Sn interaction.107 The 29Si NMR spectra of dihydrosilanes 165­167 showed small upfield shifts compared to the closely related unsubstituted analogue Ph2SiH2 ( 29Si = -34.5 ppm).108 These small  values suggest that there is only a weak to no Si-S interaction present.

38

Scheme 14: Synthesis of SiF3, SiH3 and SiPhHCl silanes containing a C,S-chelating ligand. The 29Si NMR data of S-donor containing compounds (158, 165-174) give no indication of donor complexation. The observed 29Si resonance for 170 is nearly identical to that of tetrahedral PhSiF3. It was also reported that the tendency of S-donor to form an adduct with SiF3 is negligible compared to N- and O-donors. These results are in accordance with recently published theoretical investigations concerning the adduct formation behaviour of SiF4.109 Slight upfield shifts of 29Si resonances of 4.9 ppm and 7.0 ppm for compounds 171 and 172 were observed compared to their unsubstituted analogues, again suggestive of only weak Si-S interactions (Table 9).

A comparison of the Sn-S distances in compounds 155-157 showed a progressive decrease in Sn-S distances given in Table 9 which corresponds to an increase of the Lewis acidity of the central tin atom. In compounds 156 and 157 the Sn-S bond is trans to Sn-Cl bond with angles of 168º and 167º respectively. The transition from tetrahedral to TBP can also be determined from the difference between the sums of equatorial and axial angles.96 A greater difference is associated with more TBP geometry. In compounds 155 and as well as in 158-160, the E-S (E = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) distances (Table 9) indicate a progressive change in the structural features of these compounds.

Scheme 15: Synthesis of a C,S-chelating ligand and reactions to form a triarylgermane or silanes. Hypervalency in the case of Ge compound 173 is associated with a large upfield 73Ge NMR shift ( = -93.0 ppm vs Ph3GeH  = -57.0 ppm) and a significant line broadening. The average distance between Ge and S was 3.778(2) Å. The data obtained from X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy for 173 support the presence of a Ge-S dative interaction, although it is still weaker when compared to similar Ge-N compounds.

1.6 C,P-chelating ligand containing compounds of Group 14:
The ability of Sn to expand its coordination number beyond four due to the donor-acceptor interactions with Lewis bases such as N and O has been conclusively established. The intramolecular interactions between Sn and soft phosphine donors are less studied.102 Higher coordination can be successfully induced by the integration of a donor atom into the side chain of an alkyl or aryl substituent.99 Dative interaction between Sn-P can be inferred from the upfield shifts of 119Sn NMR resonance signals and short Sn-P distances and the large values of the J119Sn31P coupling constant

compared to tetracoordinated tin compounds.102,103 The ligands used to obtain

the molecules having Sn-P interaction are given in Figure 24.

Figure 24: Structure of C,P-chelating ligands.

Figure 25: Organotin compounds containing C,P-chelating ligands.110, 112-114 Compounds 175-178 and 179 (Figure 25) were synthesized by von Abicht et al.112 and Lin et al.110 by reacting o-(C6H4CH2PPh2)Li and o-(Ph2P)C6H4Li with R3SnCl and Ph2SnCl2 respectively in Et2O. The 31P NMR resonance at -1.0 ppm for 179 is downfield from -4.0 ppm for Ph3P, and the 119Sn NMR chemical shift of -101.7 ppm for 179 is significantly upfield compared to Ph3SnCl (-45.0 ppm). The same observations were obtained in the case of o-((iPr2P)C6H4)2SnPhCl 179a which showed 119Sn resonance of -126.4 ppm. X-ray crystallography of both 179 and 179a showed Sn-P distance of 3.125(4) and 3.120(1) Å which is less than the sum of van der Waals radii (4.2 Å).110 Therefore, a dative interaction is likely present between Sn and P. The P-Sn-Cl bond angles of 159.76º (1)and 153.92º(1) clearly suggests that the coordination geometry at the tin centers is TBP. Compound 182 was synthesized by treating o-(C6H4CH2PPh2)Br with Me2SiHCl. Berlekamp et al.107 reported the synthesis of 183-185 by using the route outlined in Scheme 16.

29

Si NMR resonances for compounds 183-185 are -62.4, -72.0 and -10.1 ppm

respectively, which indicate only very small upfield shifts compared to structurally similar nonchelating silanes. This data anticipates the non-coordinating behavior of P in compounds 183-185.

1.7 Polystannanes:
Group 14 elements (E = C, Si, Ge, Sn and Pb) have a unique tendency towards catenation, which decreases significantly from carbon to lead. In the early 1980's, the synthesis of polysilanes introduced a new class of materials with interesting electronic and optical properties due to the presence of significant -delocalization116 along the polymer backbone which also stimulated a similar interest in polystannanes. Polystannanes represent a unique class of polymers having a backbone of covalently bonded metal (Sn) atoms. Polystannane possess extensive -delocalization compared to polysilanes because of their more diffuse orbitals, lower band gaps (>390 nm,116 some 70 nm or more red-shifted vs. Si) and greater metallic character.43 It was first demonstrated by Dräger et al.117 that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of oligostannanes decreased when the number of tin atoms in the chain was increased, and a significantly red shifted absorption maxima in UV spectra was observed. A consequence of catenation in polystannane is longer central Sn-Sn bonds and flatter Sn-Sn-Sn angles. Thus, the term "molecular metal" was proposed by Dräger to describe high molecular weight analogues.117 The tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexastannanes were isolated and characterized by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy and X-ray analyses.

1.7.1 Challenges for polystannanes: Polystannanes are thermally stable up to 200 ºC in inert atmosphere as well as in air.108,110112

Polystannanes show sensitivity to the ambient environment, have greater stability in the solid

state than in solution, and suffer a higher rate of degradation under light exposure compared to dark.116,118,121-123 Furthermore, it was found that poly(dialkylstannane)s degrade immediately upon exposure to light to five- and six-membered cyclic oligostannanes, whereas poly(diarylstannane)s were stable in the dark in air for at least one week.119 Choffat et al.122 reported degradation studies of poly(dialkylstannane)s having alkyl side groups of varying lengths, in the presence of different solvents and dyes. It was demonstrated that the length of the alkyl side chain has no significant influence on the stability of these polymers. It was found that the use of dyes such as Sudan 1, Sudan Black B, or inorganic colloidal platinum, or organic small molecules such as carotene, curcumin and TEMPO reduced the rate of degradation. The reason for the reduction of degradation may be the absorption of light by these species or the reaction with transient radicals or both. Trummer et al.124 reported that the stability of polystannanes in light is dependent on the nature of the organic side groups. The degradation behaviour of two polymers, poly[bis(4-butylphenyl)stannane] and poly(dibutylstannane) were studied, and the diarylpolystannanes were found to be more stable towards light than the dialkyl in THF as well as in DCM. The initial photochemical damage caused by laser flash photolysis is comparable for both polymers. Poly[bis(4-butylphenyl)stannane] "recovered" to 90% during a period of a few seconds after irradiation. The higher recovery of poly[bis(4-butylphenyl)stannane] degraded by photolysis may be the re-formation of polymer chains resulting in an apparent stabilization of this polymer. This type of behaviour was not observed for poly(di-nbutylstannane). The degradation mechanism proposed in this study is based on the random homolytic cleavage of Sn-Sn bonds in a polymer chain resulting in two smaller chains ending with
45

a radical (Figure 28). The enhanced stability of a chain ending with two aromatic groups bonded to a tin atom may be due to the radical delocalization throughout the aromatic ring which decreases the probability of the radical reacting with the polymer chains. This mechanism was further supported by the fact that in the presence of the radical scavenger 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) in THF, the degradation rate of polystannanes was slow. In the absence of BHT the degradation of polystannane was rapid.

Figure 28: Proposed degradation mechanism of polystannanes. 1.7.2 Synthesis of polystannanes: The common reductive coupling methods used for the synthesis of polystannanes include Wurtz type, electrochemical and catalytic dehydrogenation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. 1.7.2.1 Wurtz coupling: Wurtz coupling was first used to form a C-C bond from the reaction of alkyl halides with sodium metal. Later, investigations by Kipping125 showed that Wurtz coupling can be used for preparation of materials having only organosilicon units in the backbone. In these Wurtz-type reactions, a dichlorodiorganosilane is reacted with a slight excess of sodium dispersion in a high46

boiling-point solvent such as toluene under reflux. In 1992, Zou et al.126 reported the first synthesis of high molecular weight (~104 Da) poly(di-n-butylstannane) using a Wurtz-type coupling of (nBu)2SnCl2 in toluene/heptane in the presence of 15-crown-5.

Scheme 17: Wurtz coupling of (n-Bu)2SnCl2. A reinvestigation of this study by Tilley failed to produce the same results and only low molecular weight oligomers were isolated under these conditions.118 This may have been due to the longer reaction times used, which caused a degradation of the polymer. In a later study by Price et al.127 high molecular weight (106 Da) poly(di-n-butylstannane) was produced in toluene at 60 ºC. It was observed that the optimal yield is achieved in 4h; after that time, degradation of the polymer begins and cyclic oligomers such as (n-Bu2Sn)5 and (n-Bu2Sn)6 are obtained as a result of "end-biting" and "back-biting" of chains. This demonstrated that reaction time is critical for these types of reactions. In 2003, Molloy et al.43 reported the Wurtz polymerization of RBr2Sn(CH2)5OC6H4C6H5 (R = Ph, n-Bu), yielding moderately high molecular weight polystannanes (RR'Sn)n (Mw = 3.0 × 105 Da; PDI = 1.30 and Mw = 2.5 × 105 Da; PDI = 1.96 respectively). Foucher et al.128 also successfully synthesized high molecular weight (Mw = 1.1 × 105 Da; PDI = 1.40 and Mw = 1.47 × 105 Da; PDI = 1.3) fluorinated polystannanes using Wurtz coupling reactions of fluorinated dichlorostannanes.

47

Scheme 18: Wurtz coupling reactions of fluorinated dichlorostannanes. Recently, Caseri et al.129 reported the polymerization of dichlorodiorganostannanes with Na in 1:2 ratio in liquid NH3. These reaction conditions afforded the polymerization of (nBu)2SnCl2 and (n-Oct)2SnCl2 to the polystannanes (n-Bu2Sn)n and (n-Oct2Sn)n having molar masses 8.0 × 103 and 6.0 × 103 Da respectively. The material produced from the reaction of Ph2SnCl2 under similar conditions was insoluble in organic solvents at room or elevated temperatures making molecular weight determination impossible; however the elemental composition of the isolated yellow product was in agreement with that of (Ph2Sn)n.130 In general, there are several disadvantages of the Wurtz synthetic method; it has limited tolerance to functional groups, the yields are moderate, the reproducibility is poor and it is dangerous due to the pyrophoric nature of Na metal and harsh reaction conditions.131

48

1.7.2.2 Electrochemical synthesis: Electrochemical polymerization has also been successfully applied to the synthesis of linear and network polystannanes. Okano et al.132 prepared poly(di-n-butylstannane) and poly(din-octylstannane) by this method. The synthesis is completed in a one compartment cell in which 20V is constantly applied between the Pt cathode and Ag anode in DME or THF with tetra nbutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte.

Scheme 19: Electrochemical polymerization dialkyltin dihalides. Yields for (n-Bu2Sn)n and (n-Oct2Sn)n polymers were between 40-60% and 30-50% respectively. The highest reported molecular weight of (n-Bu2Sn)n and (n-Oct2Sn)n from this method was 1.09 × 104 (PDI = 2.6) and 0.59 × 104 Da (PDI = 1.7) respectively.124 Kulandainathan et al.133 reported the polymerization of Me2SnCl2 using aluminium rods as the cathode and anode and 0.4 M tetra n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBATFB) in DME as the supporting electrolyte and reaction solvent. Network polystannanes of methyl-, n-butyl-, n-octyl-, and phenyl-trichlorostannane were also synthesized by electrochemical reduction reaction. The estimated molar masses of these polymers were 4-10 × 104 Da.134

49

1.7.2.3 Catalytic dehydrogenation: Polystannanes are readily synthesized by catalytic dehydrocoupling of alkyl or aryl tin dihydrides. Harrod et al.135 had earlier reported the catalytic dehydrocoupling of silanes (PhSiH3) and germanes (PhGeH3) to oligosilanes and oligogermanes which is facilitated by Group IV metallocene (M = Ti, Zr) catalysts (Cp2MR2 (Cp = 5-C5H5)). By contrast, transition metal complexes of Ti, Zr, Hf, Cr, Mo, W, Rh, Pt have been employed as catalysts for the dehydropolymerization of primary and secondary stannanes. This method is most successful for the polymerization of secondary stannanes, R2SnH2.

Scheme 21: Catalytic dehydrocoupling of diorganostannanes. Tilley et al.136 reported the synthesis of high molecular weight (Mw = 1.7 × 104 Da) poly(din-butylstannane) by catalytic dehydrocoupling. Using [Zr(n-C5H5)(n-C5Me5){Si(SiMe3)3}Me]. Tilley et al. 118 also synthesized high molecular weight polystannanes along with cyclic products from the dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes using the simpler organometallic zirconium catalyst Cp2ZrMe2. The best examples for poly(dialkylstannanes) are 186 (Mw = 4.6 × 104 Da) and 187 (Mw = 9.2 × 104 Da) and for poly(diarylstannanes) are H[(p-But-C6H4)2Sn]nH (Mw = 5.6 × 104 Da) and H[(p-Hex-C6H4)2Sn]nH (Mw = 4.8 × 104 Da). Sita et al.121 catalyzed the polymerization of (n-Bu)2SnH2 utilizing the commercially available

carbonyltris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I) hydride, HRh(CO)(PPh3)3. The synthesis of high molecular weight 186 (Mw = 5.0 × 104 Da) was confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) along with a small amount of oligomeric or cyclic components. Kim et al.137 investigated the dehydrocoupling of the (n-Bu)2SnH2 utilizing a series of early transition metal catalysts

50

Cp2MCl2/Red-Al (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) and M(CO)6/Red-Al (M = Cr, Mo, W). This produced two phases of polymers, one a cross-linked insoluble material and the other a non cross-linked THF soluble solid. Tilley et al.138 has also used hafnocene stannyl complexes for the dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes. The catalyst [Me2C(C5H4)2]Hf(SnHMes2)NMe2, produced H(n-Bu2Sn)nH polymer that was isolated as a yellow solid (Mw = 2.0 × 104 Da) along with cyclic oligomers.

Scheme 22: Hafnocene catalyzed dehydrocoupling of (n-Bu)2SnH2 Schubert et al.139 attempted the dehydrocoupling of stannanes ((n-Bu)2SnH2 and Ph2SnH2) to polystannanes using (PhMe2P)2PtMe2 or [(2-P,N)-Ph2PC2H4NMe2]PtMe2. Soluble poly(di-nbutylstannane) was observed by 119Sn NMR analysis along with the appearance of cyclic and linear oligomers whereas only insoluble material reovered when Ph2SnH2 was polymerized. More recently, Caseri et al.119-120, 140 reported the synthesis of high molecular weight alkylpolystannanes catalyzed by Wilkinson's catalyst, [RhCl(PPh3)3]. The polymers obtained were isolated without the detectable amount of cyclic oligomers. This polymerization is sensitive to the steric bulk of branched dialkylstannanes and the polymerization only proceeds if at least two methylene groups are present between the an aryl carbon and the tin atom.141 Samarium diiodide (SmI2) was used to synthesize low molecular weight

poly(dialkystannanes) under mild conditions from R2SnCl2 (R = Me-, Et-, n-Hex-).143,144 SmI2 is a mild one-electron reducing agent of a homogeneous nature and has been applied to the catenation of Group 14 elements. The polymerization was carried out at room temperature using SmI2 (2.0

51

eq.) in HMPA/THF and a reaction time of 24-120 h. The maximum molecular weight 4.82 × 103 Da was obtained for (Et2Sn)n. Beckmann et al.142 prepared first example of a chiral polystannane by catalytic dehydrocoupling following Scheme 23.

Scheme 23: Synthesis of chiral polystannanes. Lechner et al.130 more recently reported the preparation of polystannanes by dehydrogenative coupling in the presence of TMEDA. The unsymmetrical polystannanes [nBu(Ph)Sn]n and [(4-n-BuPh)2Sn]n were synthesized having molar weights of 1.3 × 104 and 4.6 × 104 Da, while PDI values were 2.0 and 3.2, respectively.

Scheme 24: TMEDA catalyzed dehydrocoupling of stannanes 1.7.3 Properties of polystannanes: Polystannanes represent an interesting class of organometallic polymers due to their thermal, optical and electronic properties. These polymers are often viscous oils or solids yellow to orange in color. Polystannanes are stable in their oil/solid state but relatively less stable in different solvents, particularly in pentane and THF. However, a major drawback of these polymers is their sensitivity towards light and moisture.

1.7.3.1 Photosensitivity: The photobleaching of polystannanes in ambient light causes the scission of Sn-Sn bonds resulting in the formation of cyclic oilgomers such as cyclic-(R2Sn)5 and (R2Sn)6. Recently,124 it was demonstrated that the photostability of polystannanes changes with the type of organic side groups. For instance, poly[bis(4-n-butylphenyl)stannane] was found to be more stable to light than poly(di-n-butyl)stannane in THF and DCM solvents. 1.7.3.2 Thermal properties: Overall, polystannanes relatively exhibit good thermal stability. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that poly(dialkylstannanes) start decomposition at temperatures > 255-270 ºC under N2 which is slightly lower than for poly(diarylstannanes) at temperature  300 ºC.116 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a technique used to measure the heat effects on the phase transitions as a function of temperature. For polystannanes it is routinely used to determine the glass transition (Tg) temperature. In the case of poly(dialkylstannanes) Tg varies between 0 ºC to 91 ºC depending upon the chain of the length of alkyl chain and for poly(alkylphenylstannane) ranges from -20 ºC to -50 ºC.120,140 1.7.3.3 Conductivity: Room temperature conductivity studies for a number of neutral polystannanes, such as poly(di(3-propylphenyl)stannanes) found values of approximately  3 × 10-8 S·cm-1 which increase with temperature a characteristic of a semi-conducting material.142 The thin film of H(nBu2Sn)nH and H(n-Oct2Sn)nH doped with SbF5 measured at room temperature had conductivity of 10-2 and 0.3 S·cm-1 respectively.118

1.7.3.4 Electronic properties: A number of electronic studies were conducted on oligostannanes which showed a systematic red shift with an increase in the chain length of the molecule. Drenth et al.

demonstrated that max for Et3Sn-(SnEt2)n-SnEt3 (n = 0-4) is red shifted and associated with a * transition from 232-325 nm. Sita at el.146 also observed similar trends for n-Bu3Sn-(n-Bu2Sn)nSn(n-Bu)2-CH2CH2OEt (n = 0-4) and Drager et al.117 for Ph3Sn-(t-Bu2Sn)n-SnPh3 (n = 1-4) oligomers.

Figure 29: The electronic spectra of (A) (n-Bu)3Sn-(n-Bu2Sn)n-Sn(n-Bu)2-(CH2)2OEt (n = 04)148, (B) for Ph3Sn-((t-Bu)2Sn)n-SnPh3 (n = 1-4).117 The max values of hydrogen terminated poly(dialkylstannane)s are in the range of 380-480 nm. The max values depend on a number of factors such as solvent, polymer conformation, molar mass and the amount of cyclics present in the sample. The max values of poly(diarylstannane)s (430-506 nm) are significantly red shifted (> 50 nm) compared to poly(dialkylstannane)s, which indicate the presence of - conjugation between aryl substituents and the tin atoms in the backbone of the polymer. The max values of polystannanes are listed in Table 10.

Sn) spectroscopy is the key instrumental tool for the structural

characterization of polystannanes. In particular, 119Sn NMR can easily differentiate between linear polymer and oligomeric chains and cyclic structures. The linear poly(dialkylstannane)s in Table 10 exhibit a single resonance around ~-190 ppm, except for the poly(diethylstannane) which shows a signal at -172.2 ppm. The 119Sn NMR resonance for poly(diarylstannane)s range from -183 to 197 ppm with the exception of [(o-Et-p-BuO-C6H3)2Sn]n which showed an unusual resonance at 125 ppm. 1.7.3.6 Thermochromic properties: The poly(dialkylstannane)s (n-Hex2Sn)n and (n-Oct2Sn)n showed reversible

thermochromic behaviour which is evident from the discoloration of these materials upon warming
55

above room temperature. UV-vis spectrometry revealed a blue shift in the absorption maximum between 384-369 nm for (n-Oct2Sn)n moving from 30-40  C in a toluene solution and from 392382 nm for a solid film of (n-Hex2Sn)n in the same temperature range. 1.7.3.7 Molecular weights: Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) has been used to estimate the molar masses of polystannanes. The molecular weights of polystannanes (Table 11) are determined against polystyrene standards of different known molecular weights in THF as the mobile phase using a RI detector.

1.8 Thesis objectives:
The main objective of this thesis is to prepare structurally stable 5-coordinate polystannanes having ligands containing different donor atoms such as N, S, P, and O. The increase in the coordination at Sn is expected to achieve the following: 1) Moderate the Lewis acidity of Sn atoms in the backbone of the polystannanes. 2) Increase steric hindrance around Sn. 3) Reduce susceptibility to nucleophilic attack. The objectives of this research can be accomplished as follows: i) Synthesize a series of diorganotin dihalides containing C,N-, C,P-, C,O- and C,Schelating ligands. ii) Prepare new diorganotin dihydrides by using LiAlH4 or NaBH4 as reducing agents. iii) Carry out the polymerization by dehydrogenative coupling of dihydrides or by the Wurtz coupling of dihalides. iv) Characterize all monomers and polymers by 1H, 13C and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy, UVvis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography where applicable. iv) Finally, investigate the material properties and stability of these new 5-coordinate polystannanes.

2.0 Results and Discussion:
2.1: Synthesis
2.1.1 Phenyloxy vinyl ethers Vinyl ethers 137 and 194-196 were synthesized following methods reported in literature.
43,148,149

These reactions are examples of classic Williamson ether syntheses where an alcohol (4-

phenylphenol or phenol), in the presence of a base (K2CO3) and an alkyl halide (i.e. allyl bromide) is converted to an ether. The reaction (Scheme 25) procedes by deprotonating the phenol to produce an aryloxide as an intermediate, which attacks the allyl bromide in a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) fashion producing the desired ethers. Acetone was the preferred solvent as (SN2) reactions work best in polar aprotic solvents.148 It was reported that a 1.1 molar equivalence of the base resulted in an optimal yield of 137 and 194.149 The target ether species was purified by first redissolving the crude product in DCM, and sequentially washing the organic layer with a 1 M NaOH solution, brine and water respectively to remove unreacted allyl bromide and phenol.148 After solvent removal compound 137 was obtained as a flaky white coloured solid, whereas compounds 194-196 were recovered as yellow coloured viscous oils.

Scheme 25: Williamson's ether synthesis of phenyloxy allyl ethers. 2.1.2: Triphenylphenyloxy propyl tin: Compounds 141 and 197-199 were synthesized via a radical hydrostannylation reaction (Scheme 25) utilizing azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the radical initiator.43 When an equimolar
59

amount of allyl ether (137 and 194-196) and Ph3SnH were used, a significant amount (>20%) of the distannane (Ph3SnSnPh3: 119Sn NMR (C6D6)  = -143 ppm) was always observed. Compounds 141 and 197-199 are relatively air and heat stable; as a result, Ph3SnSnPh3 and unreacted starting material were readily separated from this mixture by vacuum sublimation. Subsequently, the dissolution of crude 141 in Et2O followed by filtration afforded a pure white coloured solid product. Compound 197 was purified by an initial wash with hexane to remove Ph3SnSnPh3, followed by heating under reduced pressure at 75 ºC for 12 h to remove unreacted 194 leaving a clear, viscous oil. Crude 198 was dissolved in MeOH to remove unreacted 195, filtered and finally dried under reduced pressure to afford a white coloured solid. The crude reaction mixture containing 199 was purified in two steps including sublimation to remove the Ph3SnSnPh3, followed by silica gel column chromatography using hexane:EtOAc (6:1). The NMR (1H,
119 13

C,

Sn) analysis of 141 was consistent with reported literature values.43 Triphenylstannanes 197-

199 were found to have very similar tin chemical environments (119Sn NMR) to 141.

Scheme 26: Synthesis of triphenylphenyloxy propyltin. 2.1.3: Phenylphenyloxy propyltin dichloride: In the original report by Molloy et al., phenyl groups attached to tin were exchanged for Br by stoichiometric bromination.43 Despite our best efforts to prepare the desired dibromide 146, most synthetic attempts resulted in the formation of a considerable amount of the mono- and
60

tribromide species that proved difficult to purify. In order to make sufficient quantities of the dihalide materials for polymerization studies, an alternative route to these materials was explored. Compounds 202-203 were obtained by stepwise conversion of compounds 197 (Figure 30) and 141 initially to the triorganotin monochlorides (200-201) and then sequentially to diorganotin dichlorides (202-203). This method was first reported by Pannell et al.96 for the synthesis of diorganotin dichlorides from triphenyl starting materials. The NMR (1H,

obtained for compound 203 showed similar chemical shifts when compared to 202.

Scheme 27: Stepwise preparation of triorganotin monochlorides and diorganotin dichlorides. The initial attempt to prepare 200 resulted in a mixture of the starting material 197 and the product monochloride. An essentially pure sample of 200 was obtained by washing the crude product with hot hexane or alternatively by the addition of a stoichiometric aliquot of the 1.0 M HCl solution (calculated on the basis of the amount of starting material from 1H NMR, see Figure 30) required to complete conversion to chloride. The monochlorides 200 and 201 were not completely converted to their respective dichlorides 202 and 203. The amount of the unreacted monochloride as calculated on the basis of the comparison of intensities of the ortho phenyl protons (2H, o-C6H4O) of the mono- and dichloride by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and the required aliquot of 1.0 M HCl/Et2O added to the solution containing the mixture of mono- and dichlorides. The progressive change from the mono61

and dichlorides (200, 202) are shown in Figure 31 respectively. The percent conversion was calculated from 1H NMR by dividing the integration of the peak for the starting materials 200 and 201 by the peak for the products according to the following formula;150 % Conversion = (x/2)/((x/2+y/2)) where y is the disappearance of peaks (6.53 ppm and 6.61 ppm for 200 and 201) while x is the appearance of new peak (6.70 ppm and 6.75 ppm for 202 and 203) respectively. Recrystallization in DCM and hexane afforded single crystals of both 202 and 203. The synthesis of the monochloride 201 by this method routinely resulted in the recovery of 10-15% of the unreacted starting material, 141. Compound 201 was purified by dissolving the crude product in hot hexane, letting it cool to room temperature and placing it into fridge overnight at -20 ºC. A white coloured crystalline product precipitated out of solution after 24 h. The starting material 141 was recovered by first decanting, then removing solvent under reduced pressure. Recrystallization of compounds 200-201 using a mixture of DCM and hexane afforded clear, colourless crystals.

An attempt to replace the third phenyl group (Scheme 27) with chlorine using Pannell's96 method for replacing the first and second phenyl groups resulted in the recovery of only clean dichloride starting material. Substitution in this case is likely hindered by the increased dative interaction between Sn-O.

Scheme 29: Preparation of triorganotin hydrides and diorganotin dihydrides. The 1H NMR (C6D6) resonances for the hydrogen atoms attached to tin in organotin hydrides range from 4.50-7.50 ppm.65 The spectrum of 207 showed a large 1J117/119Sn-1H coupling constant characteristic of most tin hydrides (Figure 32, Table 13).

65

Figure 32: 1H NMR (C6D6) spectrum of 207. A comparison of coupling constants in Table 13 suggest that the dative interaction between Sn and O atoms for organotin hydrides causes a slight increase in the magnitude of the coupling constants as compared to dihydrides. The 119Sn and 1H NMR (C6D6) chemical shifts for several tin hydrides (204-207 and 69, 70) are listed in Table 13. Table 13: 119Sn NMR (C6D6) data for organotin hydrides.

2.1.5: Dimerization of 204 and 205: Dimerization of 204 and 205 was achieved by catalytic dehydrocoupling using Pd(PPh3)4. The distannane 208 was purified by column chromatography using hexane:EtOAc (1:1) and 209 by extraction with petroleum ether. Similar distannanes having a hypercoordinate donor interaction were previously reported by Rupnicki et al.70

Scheme 31: 5-coordinate distannanes. The values of 1J119Sn­119Sn couplings for aryl-substituted distannane 208 having Sn-O interactions are distinctly higher than Ph6Sn2. In the case of known distannanes 211 and 212, replacement of one or two n-butyl groups in (n-Bu)6Sn2 by the 2-(4-isopropyl-2-oxazolinyl)-5phenyl ligand results in an increase of 1048 and 3500 Hz for the 1J119Sn­119Sn coupling compared ro Ph6Sn2. A remarkable increase of the 1J119Sn­119Sn to 2748 Hz to 11272 was caused by replacement of two n-butyl groups in (n-Bu)6Sn2 with electronegative acetoxy groups due to the Sn-O interactions in n-Bu4Sn2(OAc)2 213.145 2.1.6: Compounds containing C,O-chelating ligand: 2.1.6.1 Benzyl methyl ether:

Scheme 32: Synthesis of benzyl methyl ether. Compound 214 was prepared by reacting benzyl bromide with NaOMe in low yield (34%). This synthetic route was attempted as a means to reduce costs as it is considerably less expensive than bromobenzyl bromide.152 Due to the low yield of this intermediate, it was abandoned and bromobenzyl bromide was used exclusively for the preparation of all C,O-chelating ligands.

Scheme 33: Synthesis of 2-bromobenzyl methyl ether. Compound 215 was prepared in good yield (84%) using bromobenzyl bromide and NaOMe (Scheme 33). 95,153 It is a stable compound and was used for further reactions. 2.1.6.3 [2-(MeOCH2)C6H4]Li:

Scheme 34: Lithiation of 2-bromobenzyl methyl ether. Compound 215 was treated with n-BuLi at -78 ºC in hexane and the reaction mixture stirred overnight. The solvent was decanted in the glove box and the solid washed with additional fresh hexane. The residual solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the product stored under inert atmosphere for further use. Surprisingly, compound 216 was found to be extremely sensitive and violently decomposed while transferring to a flask (Figure 34) from the weighing dish in the glove box. Thereafter, this product was only prepared in situ for use in all further reactions.

2.1.6.4 2-Trialky/arylstannylbenzyl methyl ether:

Scheme 35: Synthesis of 2-Trialky/arylstannylbenzyl methyl ether. Compound 113 was obtained in a 70 % yield and isolated as a clear oil. This yield was somewhat less than that reported for 113 in the literature (84 %).95 The 119Sn resonance for 113 was -32.5 ppm (CDCl3) and is shifted slightly downfield from the reported value ( = -38.2 ppm obtained in d8THF at -78 ºC). The stannylbenzyl methoxy ethers 112 and 217 were prepared in a manner similar to that used for 113. Compound 217 was obtained as yellow-brown coloured oil in good yield (65 %) while compound 112 was recovered as a white solid in 73 % yield with a melting point of 95 ºC (Scheme 35). Gilman et al.94 had previously synthesized 112 in a 35 % yield by reacting (o-MeOCH2C6H4)MgBr with Ph3SnCl. He reported a melting point of 94.5 - 95.5 ºC for 112 however no NMR characterization was provided. 2.1.6.5 2-Chloroalkyl/arylstannylbenzyl methoxy ethers:

Scheme 36: Synthesis of dichloroalkyl/arylstannylbenzyl methoxy ethers. Compounds 218-220 were prepared as brown coloured oils by addition of 216 to a precooled (-78 ºC) hexane/Et2O solution of the appropriate organotin halide. Compounds 218 and 219 were isolated after extraction of their crude mixtures with toluene and hot hexane, respectively. The 119Sn NMR (CDCl3) analysis showed only a single resonance for both 218 ( = -54 ppm) and 219 ( = -60.0 ppm). The 119Sn NMR spectrum of 220 revealed two unidentified peaks of small
71

intensity at  = -48.0 and -132.0 ppm, along with the main resonance at  = -28.0 ppm. Purification of compound 220 by hot hexane extraction was unsuccessful even after several attempts. The reported resonance for the closely related compound 118 prepared by Pannell et al.96 was found at  = -32.69 ppm with the (o-MeOC6H4)CH2 ligand instead of (o-MeOCH2C6H4) used for 220.

Scheme 37: Synthesis of the chloro(2-(methoxymethyl)phenyl)diphenylstannane 221. Compound 221 was obtained as white coloured solid after precipitating the product in hexane at -20 ºC. The
119

Sn NMR (CDCl3) chemical shift for the recovered monochloride solid

221 was -127.0 ppm (Scheme 37). The soluble fraction from this reaction in hexane displayed a
119

Sn NMR chemical shift at -136.0 ppm which is similar to the chemical shift observed for 225

(see page 74). Compound 221 was also obtained by reacting compound 112 in C6H6 with 1.6 M HCl solution in Et2O in a 81% yield; this is considerably higher than in Scheme 38. An attempt to convert the monochloride, 221 to the dichloride by further reaction with the HCl solution was undertaken (Scheme 38). This reaction resulted in only unreacted 221, which might be due to the presence of a substantial Sn-O interaction in the monochloride. 119Sn NMR chemical shifts, Sn-O bond distances and yields of stannanes 112-113 and 217-221 are listed in Table 15.

No assignments of this mixture was made and no further attempts to purify this material were undertaken. Similarly, the reaction of 216 with (n-Bu)2SnCl2 showed six unassigned

The oily reaction mixture was stored in the glove box and after 30 days, an off-white coloured solid material separated from the oil. The solid was then washed with hexane and its 119Sn NMR (CDCl3) spectrum showed two resonances at -91.0 and -138.0 ppm of unequal intensities. This may be due to the exchange of the axial and equatorial positions of Cl atom attached to the tin. When Cl is in axial position, it pulls the electron density from tin and promotes a strong Sn-O interaction which may be absent if the Cl occupies an equatorial position (Figure 35). An accurate mass determination by mass spectrometry was consistent for a structure with a formulae 223.

The crude products of these reactions were not successfully purified by extraction techniques, however NMR (1H, 13C, 119Sn) and mass spectrometry of the crude products 224-225 were obtained. The

NMR of both 224 and 225 showed three resonances, along with a signals of higher intensity at 73.0 ppm and -136 ppm respectively.

Donor­acceptor interactions between Sn and O in hypervalent compounds have been previously confirmed by small molecule X-ray diffraction techniques as well as by NMR spectroscopy.45,155-156 Dakternieks et al. obtained new triorganotin and tin hydrides containing either the chiral 2-(4-isopropyl-2-oxazolinyl)-5-phenyl or the 2-(4-isopropyl-2-oxazolinyl)-5(methyl)phenyl ligand.68 The 1H NMR spectroscopy of 227 (Figure 36) show distinct 119/117Sn-H coupling constants which are larger than the structurally similar tetracoordinate tin compounds (Table 16).

To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of the organotin dihydrides containing a C,O-chelating ligand (Figure 36).

Figure 36: 1H NMR (C6D6) spectrum of 227. 2.1.7 Organotin compounds containing a C,N-chelating ligand The synthesis of 2-bromo-N,N-dimethylbenzylamine (228) was unsuccessfully attempted using a literature preparation involving the reaction of 2-bromobenzyl bromide and dimethylamine (1:1.5) at room temperature for 6 h.158 However, this C,N- ligand was prepared in high yield (88%) and purity by heating 2-bromobenzyl bromide with an excess of dimethylamine. The product was recovered by extraction with 3M HCl, 20% NaOH and finally with DCM.159 Compounds 33, 35 and 37 were obtained according to Scheme 42 by reacting 229 with either MeSnCl3, n-BuSnCl3 or PhSnCl3 respectively. Compound 33 was previously reported by
75

van Koten et al.59 from the reaction of [2-(Me2NCH2)C6H4]Cu with MeSnCl3 in C6H6. Varga et al.45 and Novák et al.29a reported the synthesis of 37 and 35 by treating 229 with n-BuSnCl3 or PhSnCl3 in C6H6 and the crude product purified by extraction with hot petroleum ether and hexane respectively. Compound 35 was also prepared by Rippstein et al.48 using Et2O as a solvent, followed by toluene extraction. The diorganotin dihalides 33, 35 and 37 reproduced in this study were synthesized using Et2O as a solvent and purified by extraction with hot hexane.

Scheme 42: Preparative routes to compounds 33, 35, 37. The intramolecular Sn-N interaction and relative change in the Lewis acidity at the Sn center of hypervalent compounds can be monitored by 119Sn and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Three parameters can be used to determine the strength of Sn-N interaction: a distinct upfield shift of
119

Sn NMR signals of these compounds as compared to their analogues before ligand substitution,
13

an increase in the coupling constants (119Sn,

C), and the presence of (2J119Sn-CH3) coupling

constant between the tin and amino methyl group. A distorted TBP geometry was expected for diorganotin dihalides (33, 35, 37) having an aryl and R group at equatorial positions, while the amino ligand occupies an axial position, leaving one axial and one equatorial position for the two halogen atoms.33,47,55

76

The 1H NMR spectra of compounds 33, 35, and 37 display a downfield shift to about 8.2 ppm for the ortho protons of C6H4- ring, which is similar for other known tin TBP compounds.59 The increase in 2J119Sn-1H coupling constant to 80 Hz for 33 also indicates the existence of TBP geometry. The upfield shift in the
119

Sn NMR to -96.4, 169.4, -104.0 ppm (Table 17) for these

compounds 33, 35, and 37, as compared to their corresponding unsubstituted analogues (MeSnCl3: 21.0 ppm, PhSnCl3: -63.0 ppm, n-BuSnCl3: 6.0 ppm respectively) provide strong evidence for a substantive Sn-N intramolecular interaction and TBP geometry.

The hydrogenation of 33 and 37 was successfully attempted by reaction with LiAlH4 (Scheme 43). Compound 228 could not be hydrogenated using the same technique.

Scheme 43: Preparation of tin dihydrides containing a C,N-chelating ligand. Hydrides 230 and 231 possess a typical 1H NMR resonance shifted downfield ( = 5.73 ppm and  = 5.62 ppm) compared to the stannyl dihydrides (n-Bu)2SnH2 (4.78 ppm)40 and Me2SnH2 (4.46 ppm).161 Another characteristic of diorganotin hydrides is that the 1J119Sn-1H coupling constants (1760 Hz for 230, 1860 Hz for 231) are larger than tetracoordinate diorganotin
77

hydrides (Me2SnH2 1758 Hz; (n-Bu)2SnH2 1675 Hz). The 119Sn chemical shifts of 230 and 231 are -236 ppm (Figure 37) and -217 ppm respectively, and are significantly shifted upfield when compared to their structurally closest analogs (n-Bu)PhSnH2 at 105 ppm and MePhSnH2 -110 ppm.157 These results suggest the presence of a stronger intramolecular Sn­N coordination in 230 than in 231.

Figure 37: 119Sn NMR(C6D6) spectrum of 230. The range of
119

Sn chemical shifts for dihydrides may be explained on the basis of the

differing electron donating ability of methyl and n-butyl groups of 230 and 231 respectively. The hydride ligand would likely be more apicophile in 230 than in 231 for these structurally confined pentacoordinated tin centers. Unfortunately, no crystal structure determinations by X-ray crystallography are yet available for these dihydrides to compare with structural information obtained from solution NMR spectroscopy.

Figure 38: 1H NMR (C6D6) spectrum of 231. In the literature there are only two reported examples (69, 70)72 of stannyl dihydrides with Sn-N interactions. The presence of dative Sn-N coordination is evident from the increase of 1J119Sn

At temperatures above room temperature, compound 231 evolved gas (presumably H2) and decomposed changing from a light yellow to orange coloured semi-solid. Analysis of these residues by 119Sn NMR revealed the complete absence of the resonance at -217.5 ppm in the orange

product and presence of a mixture of unidentified tin containing species. The use of LiAlH4 as a reducing agent for 35 appeared to favour a redistribution reaction. The 119Sn NMR spectrum of the product showed a resonance at -181 ppm, similar to value reported earlier by Turek et al.66 for 232. A softer hydrogenating agent, NaBH4, was then used and a yellow coloured oil obtained (Scheme 44). Once again the 119Sn NMR resonance at -181 ppm corresponded to the presence of the redistribution product 232 and a second unidentified resonance at -223 ppm which may be the dihydride. No further characterization of this compound was attempted at this time.

After washing with hexane, (o(diphenylphosphino)benzyl) lithium was suspended in dry C6H6 and treated with solution of either Ph3SnCl or PhSnCl3 in C6H6 to prepare 241 and 242 respectively. The 119Sn NMR spectrum of 241 showed a single resonance at  = -85.0 ppm and the 31P NMR spectrum a resonance at  = -9.8 ppm. Similarly, the reaction of 240a with PhSnCl3 showed a 119Sn resonance at  = -27.0 ppm and
31

P NMR resonance at  = 43.0 ppm with four unidentified small impurity peaks. No further

characterization of these compounds was attempted at this time.

2.2 Characterization and Properties:
Crystal structure data for the dibromostannane 146, similar to compounds prepared in this study (200, 201, 202, 203) was previously reported by Molloy et al.43 Compound 198 was recrystallized in methanol, while 200, 201, 202 and 203 were recrystallized using a 1:1 ratio of DCM:hexane. Crystallographic data for compounds 198, 202-203 are listed in Table 19 and in Tables A1-A29 and the ORTEP representation of their unit cell components in Figure 45-48. The crystal structure determination of 198 (Figure 45) revealed a distorted tetrahedral geometry about tin with the central bond angles ranging from 103-117º. The absence of a Sn-O dative interaction in 198 may due to the steric bulk of three phenyl rings at tin. Compounds 200 (Figure 46), 201 (Figure 47), 202 (Figure 48) and 203 (Figure 49) all display a distorted trigonal bipyramidal
86

geometry around tin with angles ranging from 69.37º-166.3º and 73.22º-170.83º, 97.49º-169.78º, 99.53º-171.02º and 97.10º-168.62º respectively. There are two unique molecules found in the unit cell for 200 with substantially different Sn-O distances (2.72 and 2.89 Å). The distance between the datively bonded Sn and O atoms is 2.80 Å (average) in 200, 2.81 Å in 201, 2.72 Å in 202 and 2.82 Å in 203. These values are smaller than the sum of the van der Waal's radii of oxygen and tin (3.70 Å) and larger than the sum of their covalent radii 2.066 Å.161 The values reported here represent a medium to strong Sn-O dative interaction. Molloy et al. 43 observed a similar Sn-O distance of 2.734(4) Å for the hypercoordinated dibromo compound 146. The significant increase in Sn-O interaction on replacing the phenyl group by Cl is likely due to a moderation of the Lewis acidity at Sn. In the structures of 200 and 202 the equatorial plane is formed by three carbon atoms while the axial positions are occupied by Cl and O atom. The values of the O-Sn-Cl bond angles are 166.30º(1A) and 170.83º(2A) for 200 and 171.02º for 202. In 201 and 203 the equatorial plane is formed by one Cl and two carbon atoms while axial positions are occupied by Cl and O atoms and the values of the O-Sn-Cl bond angle are 169.78º for 201 and 168.62º for 203. The dative interactions between Sn and O are found trans to Sn-Cl bond and nearly linear. For compounds 200-203 the Sn-C (phenyl) bond lengths are within the sum of covalent radii (2.15 Å) for tin and carbon.165 The strength of Sn-O interaction can impact the geometry of these molecules. The difference between the sum of equatorial angles and sum of the axial angles can be used to monitor the transition from tetrahedral to TBP geometry (Figure 43, Table 20).96,101,166-168 This difference would be zero (eq-ax = 328.5  - 328.5  = 0) for a tetrahedral geometry while for TBP geometry it would be 90  (eq - ax = 360  - 270  = 90); the greater the value of (eq ­ ax) more TBP the structure.

2.3 Polymerization and characterization:
2.3.1: Wurtz coupling: The polymerization of 37 by Wurtz coupling under different conditions produced three products that were identified by 119Sn NMR spectroscopy. The distannane171 243, stannoxane bis{[2-(N,N-dimethyaminomethyl)phenyl]n-butylchloro}tin oxide171 244 and the bis-{[2-(N,Ndimethyaminomethyl)phenyl]di-n-butyltin(IV) 245 were obtained from two reaction.66 Previous work by Turek et al. 171 who prepared 243 by adding a solution (1:1 hexane/C6H6) of 37 to a Kmirror at -30 ºC that was stirred for one week at RT produced a single 119Sn NMR resonance at  = -88.1 ppm. Turek then bubbled oxygen through the solution containing 243 and converted it to 244 generating two 119Sn NMR signals at -134.5 and -137.5 ppm that are presumably two possible stereoisomers 224a and 244b.

The results obtained by the Wurtz coupling of 35 and 37 are comparable to the previously reported values. Earlier polystannanes studies showed that the reduction of (n-Bu)2SnCl2 using Na in toluene at 60 °C lead to high molecular weight polymer poly(Bu2Sn)n (n  4000­5000) in addition to five and six membered cyclic oligomers in varying amounts.127 On the other hand, the reduction of bulkier stannanes, such as (t-Bu)2SnCl2, mainly produced smaller oligostannane rings, such as cyclo-(t-Bu2Sn)4.172 Beckmann et al.145 reported that the reduction of cis-Myr2SnCl2 and transMyr2SnCl2 (Myr = myrtanyl) under same reaction conditions resulted in a mixture of unidentified products with the 119Sn NMR spectra of the crude reaction mixtures of both revealing more than 10 signals. The reduction of cis-Myr2SnCl2 and trans-Myr2SnCl2 with Mg resulted in the exclusive formation of five-membered oligostannane rings cyclo-(cis-Myr2Sn)5 and cyclo-(trans-Myr2Sn)5.
119

Sn NMR (CDCl3) spectra of cyclo-(cis-Myr2Sn)5 and cyclo-(trans-Myr2Sn)5 showed signals 

= ­209.9 and ­218.1 ppm which are close to the resonances obtained for the Wurtz coupled of 35 at  = -210.6 and -212.2 ppm which are likely the 5- and 6-membered cyclics. 2.3.2 Dehydrocoupling: 2.3.2.1: Metal catalyzed dehydrocoupling: The synthesis of polymers 248-250 are based on the metal-catalyzed

dehydropolymerization (Scheme 54, 55) of a diarylstannane with different chelating ligands. As the polymerization proceeded, the colour of reaction mixture changed from colourless to yellow to dark orange and finally to dark brown for the solid polymer. Dehydrocoupling of the hypercoordinated compound 231 using Wilkinson's catalyst was unsuccessful. However polymerization did occur in the presence of Cp2ZrMe2 in hexane. The reaction was monitored by

H NMR spectroscopy until the signal for the Sn-H resonance completely disappeared. The solvent
119

was removed under reduced pressure and the

Sn NMR (C6D6) analysis of the crude product

showed resonances at  = -49.0, 114.0, 162.0 ppm. A portion of the crude product precipitated slightly in hexane and was filtered off. The solid was insoluble in common organic solvents. The
119

Sn NMR (C6D6) of the hexane soluble fraction was obtained and it revealed a sharp single

resonance at -49 ppm (Figure 53).

Figure 53:119Sn NMR (C6D6) spectrum of 248. Polymers 249-250 were synthesized by catalytic dehydrocoupling of monomers 206-207 using Wilkinson's catalyst in toluene. It was suggested by Molloy et al.43 that the Wurtz coupling of the dibromide 146 did not proceed as a result of the sterically hindered 5-coordinate structure at tin from the chelating propylether group. The polymerization of dihydrides 206 and 207 is an indication of the absence of 5-coordinate geometry at tin in these tin dihydrides. The polymers were purified by precipitating THF solutions of the crude mixtures twice in petroleum ether. The gummy orange/yellow coloured polymers remained attached to the walls of the flask. The residual solvent was removed from the purified product by prolonged drying under reduced pressure. The soft gummy polymers were characterized fully by NMR (1H, 13C, 119Sn) spectroscopy.

Sn NMR revealed a single broad peak at -199 ppm (Figure 55) for 249 and -195 ppm for

250 respectively, which is 16-19 ppm downfield compared to their starting monomers 206-207. The disappearance of both the monomer signal at ca.  = -215 ppm in the 119Sn NMR spectrum

102

and the Sn­H signal (ca. 5.5 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectra reflect a complete monomer conversion.

H NMR spectroscopy also showed broad peaks (Figure 54) which is typical in case of polymers.

This may be a result of steric crowding at tin as a result of the C,O-chelating ligands. Lechner et al.130 used TMEDA for the polymerization of R2SnH2 (R = nbutyl, phenyl, 4-n-butylphenyl) to polymers 251 and 252 which gave 197 ppm, a typical region for polystannanes.

Figure 56: TMEDA catalyzed polymerization of organotin dihyrides.130 Dehydrocoupling of 227 in the presence of TMEDA produced the desired polymer 251 in 36 h. This reaction proceeds most likely via a radical process as predicted by Davies et al. for the reaction of R2SnXH with pyridine.173 The 119Sn NMR resonance for 251 was located at -196 ppm, shifting 13.0 ppm downfield from the monomer chemical shift of the resonance. There are some other peaks upfield of the polymer peak at  = -198 ppm to -200 ppm, which may be due to the cyclic oligomeric species (Figure 57).

Figure 57: 119Sn NMR (C6D6) spectrum of 251. 2.3.3 Characterization of polymers: 2.3.3.1 GPC Characterization: Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is equipped with a triple detection system to determine the absolute molecular weight of polymers. GPC analysis of polystannanes (solution in THF) typically causes chain cleavage or clipping of polymers due to the laser (0 = 670 nm) used. The analysis of polymers 248-250 was attempted using solutions (1 × 10-4 M) of these materials in THF. It was observed that the signal intensity for the right angle and low angle detectors which use the laser source would not appear in the GPC, presumably as a result of photodegradation of the polystannane. This results in the clipping of Sn-Sn bonds in polymer backbone converting polymer to oligomers. If the laser is turned off for the light scattering detector, signal response from both the refractive index (RI) and intrinsic viscometry (IV) are observed. To mitigate this issue, a UV-A photoabsorber was introduced to the THF solutions and exposure minimized.
105

Compounds 206-207 were catalytically dehydrocoupled using Wilkinson's catalyst to polymers 249 and 250. These gummy yellow coloured materials were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as DCM, THF and C6H6. A solution of these polymers in THF was used for molar mass determination. The Mw for 250 was 1.01×105 Da with a PDI 1.3. The molar masses of these polymers are in the range of polymer material reported previously by Molloy.43 The PDI values indicate that the polymers are relatively uniform and contain chains that are essentially monomodal. Similar polymers (252, 253) were synthesized by Molloy et al.43 via Wurtz coupling of dibromides (147, 150) with molar masses 2.50 - 3.00 × 105 Da and with PDI of 1.3 and 2.0 respectively comparable to the values found in this effort. The properties of these polymers are given in Table 22.

Polymerization of monomers 227 and 231 using Wilkinson's catalyst was unsuccessful. This may suggest that the presence of bulky groups in close proximity to the tin center such as the chelating ligand containing donor atoms like N and O hindered the polymerization with [RhCl(PPh3)3]. 1H and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy of the polymerization attempt did not show any signals attributable to polymers. Dehydrocoupling of 227 and 231 using TMEDA and Cp2ZrMe2 in Et2O and hexane respectively resulted in polymeric products. The GPC of the crude product 248 in THF produced a molecular weight Mw = 3.2 × 104 Da and PDI = 1.8. An attempt to purify the polymer by precipitation of the THF solution in hexane afforded a small amount of a THF insoluble light yellow coloured solid. No further characterization of this insoluble material was undertaken. A gummy yellow coloured polymer of 248 was used for NMR and GPC analysis.

Figure 59: Triple detector GPC trace (THF) of polymer 248 2.3.3.2 Electronic properties: The UV-Vis spectroscopy of polystananes 249 and 250 display a strong allowed -* transition at 228 nm. A lower intensity -* transition is found at max = 273 nm for these polymers with tailing to max 325 nm. The tailing at 325 nm suggest that the tin atoms of the backbone are delocalized as a result of strong overlap. The strong -* transition at max = 255 nm was also reported by Molloy's et al.43 for poly[phenyl5-(4-biphenyloxy)pentyl]tin synthesized by Wurtz coupling which does not hypercoordinate.

These Tg values reported for previously found for these polymers fall between for polydialkyl- (0 ºC to 91 ºC) and polydialkyphenylstannanes (-20 ºC to 50 ºC).

in dark and did not show any degradation after one week. However, degradation was observed after 1 day in ambient light and the 119Sn NMR signals characteristic for polymer 250 gradually disappeared with appearance of four new signals with chemical shifts  = 27.0, -23.0, -34.0, -67.0 and -207 ppm. These new signals continuously increase with continued light exposure and the

NMR signals at  = -207 ppm are similar to that reported by Choffat et al. for five and six membered cyclo-oligo(dipropylstannane) at  = -207.4 and -207.9 ppm respectively. It was previously shown that poly(dialkylstannane)s exhibit an absorption maximum in the region of 370­410 nm,118,119, 121,127,136,132 which is caused by delocalization of the -electrons of the tin atoms along the polymer backbone. In several reports, the degree of degradation of these materials was evaluated from the UV-Vis spectroscopy.127,136,132 In this study, the extent of degradation of polymer 250 was investigated in THF solutions at a concentration 5.9 × 10-5 mol/L in the range of 200­500 nm for 5 consecutive scans over intervals of 10 days (1, 10, 20 days). No significant degradation was observed under these conditions as the absorption bands at different intervals are superimposable (Figure 62). The most probable reason of these conflicting solution stability results of 119Sn NMR and UV studies may be the solvent dependence.

3.0 Conclusion:
A variety of organotin compounds containing potential Sn-E (E = N, O, P and S) interactions were synthesized and characterized using different techniques. Tetraorganotin compounds 141, 198-199 with tethered phenyloxy moieties were prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy (1H,
13

C,

119

Sn), HRMS spectroscopy or elemental analysis and X-ray

crystallography in case of 198. Triorganotin chlorides 200-201 were synthesized from a stepwise replacement of the phenyl groups with HCl and further converted using the same methodology to produce diorganotin dihalides 202-203. These organotin halides 200-203 were structurally characterized to reveal moderate to strong Sn-O interactions. Novel tin hydrides 204-207 were prepared by the reduction of organotin halides 200-203 with LiAlH4 and used for polymerization studies. Model hexaorganoditin 208-209 were also prepared by dehydrocoupling of triorganotin hydrides 204-205. Organotin compounds with C,O- chelating ligands were also synthesized. Tetraorganotin compounds 112 and 217 were prepared in good or improved yields. Organotin halides 218-219 containing a C,O- chelating ligand were synthesized from the reaction of the lithiated salt 216 with RSnCl3 (R = Me, n-Bu). An attempt to replace the phenyl group of 112 with chlorine resulted in redistribution product 221. Reduction of tin dihalides 218 and 219 afforded two novel diorganotin dihydrides 226 and 227. Tin dichlorides 33, 35, 37 containing a C,N-chelating ligand were also synthesized. The hydrogenation of 33 and 35 resulted in the formation of tin dihydrides 230 and 231. Wurtz coupling of dichlorides 35 and 37 resulted in distannanes 243-246 that were previously reported in literature by different methods.

113

Sulfur containing 233 and 234 were prepared using a modified method and investigated for their suitability for organotin compounds containing a C,S- chelating ligand. Reaction attempts to produce the organotin compounds with a C,S- chelating ligand resulted in the formation of multiple products and the purification attempts were unsuccessful. Compound 239 with a C,Pfunctionality was synthesized and used to produce compound 241. NMR analysis of 241 revealed a single 119Sn and 31P resonance. Catalytic dehydropolymerization of diorganotin dihydrides was completed using both metal and non-metal catalysts. Diorganotin dihydrides 206-207 catalytically dehydrocoupled in the presence of Wilkinson's catalyst resulted in the formation of polymers 249-250. These polymers were obtained as orange-yellow coloured gums. GPC analysis of 250 in THF yielded a moderate molecular weight polymer (Mw = 1.1 × 105 Da, PDI = 1.3). A DSC thermal analysis of of polymers 249 and 250 revealed glass transition temperatures (Tg) of 65 ºC and 64 ºC respectively. Dehydrocoupling of compound 231 was successfully completed in the presence of Cp2ZrMe2 in hexane. GPC analysis of 248 in THF yielded a moderate molecular weight polymer (Mw = 3.2 × 104 Da, PDI 1.8). Non-metal catalyzed dehydrocoupling of compound 227 in the presence of TMEDA produced the desired polymer 253 which has not been fully characterized. Stability studies of polymer 250 by 119Sn NMR and UV-visible spectroscopies indicated a faster degradation in C6D6 than in THF. Overall, this polymer was considerably more stable than known poly(dialkyl)stannanes. Our investigation of organotin compounds containing different chelating ligands indicates that substantial intramolecular interactions between Sn-E (E = N, O) are present in monomers that contain at least one halide and adopt TBP geometry. The degree of the Sn-E interaction likely decreases as the halides are converted to hydrides as there is a substantial decrease of
114

electronegativity at Sn which reduces its ability to draw electron density into a 3c-4e arrangement as well as the lack of orbitals to accommodate the extra electron density. The dative interaction in polystannanes 249-251 seems to be completely absent as is evident from their 119Sn NMR chemical shifts ( = -195 ppm to -199 ppm) which are very similar to most known polystannanes. In the case of 248, the 119Sn NMR resonance at -49 ppm suggests that the dative interaction between Sn and N atom is likely still present.

115

4.0 Future work:
In this study asymmetrical polystannanes were prepared from diorganotin dihydrides synthesized from 5-coordinate diorganotin dihalides possess Sn-E (E = N, O) intramolecular interactions. The characterization of these new polystannanes indicated that the hypercoordination geometry is likely not preserved, except perhaps in the polymer with a Sn-N interaction as evident by a dramatic downfield chemical shift. All polymeric materials displayed considerable stability in solid state and in solution in dark. It has been previously established that wavelengths at visible light are harmful for these type of materials and cause photodegradation. Unless the issue of photostability is sufficiently resolved, the utility of polystannanes for applications such as polymeric wires will not be realized. To overcome this problem we propose the use of light absorbing chromophore side chains. The chromophore has the ability to absorb wavelengths of visible light and reflects or transmit the others. There are some examples of the molecule having side groups such as azobenzene that are currently being developed in our lab. These can be used as starting point to produce the dihydrides and dehydrocoupled to structurally more stable polystannanes. This will not increase the strength of Sn-Sn bonds but should reduce the light exposure of Sn-Sn bonds in the backbone of the polymers. Further investigation of the geometry in polymers such as 249 and 250 has not been conclusively established. Analysis of the Sn environments by Mössbauer spectroscopy for these polymers would be instructive. Structural characterization by X-ray diffraction would also shed light on the geometry of the new dihydrides. Molecular modelling of monomers, oligomers and polymers could also provide insight into the extent the Lewis acidity at Sn is moderated by chelating ligands. This has not been established for any of the new molecules made in this study.
116

Finally, a systemic investigation of the polymerization behaviour of structurally hindered tin sites to establish general rules, including solvent and catalyst choices, length of polymerizations, concentrations, to guide optimum polymerization outcomes is required.

Molecular weights of polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Viscotek Triple Model 302 Detector system equipped with a Refractive Index Detector (RI), a four capillary differential viscometer (VISC), a right angle (90º) laser light scattering detector (0 = 670 nm) and a low angle (7º) laser light scattering detector. GPC columns were calibrated versus polystyrene standards (American Polymer Standards). A flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1 was used with ACS grade THF as the eluent. GPC samples were prepared using 3­10 mg of polymers per mL THF, and filtered using a 0.45 m filter. All samples were run with and without UVA (conc.  0.001 M) for comparison. All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere using Schlenk techniques unless otherwise described. A Bruker-Nonius Kappa-CCD diffractometer at the University of Toronto was used to obtain the X-ray diffraction data for crystal structures. High resolution mass spectrometry experiments were carried out using an accuTOF DART-MS at the University of Toronto. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab of Norcross Georgia. 4-phenylphenol, KOH, KI, K2CO3, AIBN, Br2, allyl bromide, LiAlH4 (1.0 M in Et2O), n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexane), anhydrous MgSO4, anhydrous CaCl2 and Wilkinson's catalyst were purchased commercially form Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. 1.6 M solution of HCl in Et2O was prepared in laboratory. Solvents were dried using MBraun solvent purification system or by standard procedures prior to use.

5.5 Synthesis of triphenyltin hydride (254):

A solution 1.0 M LiAlH4 (11.0 mL, 11.0 mmol) in 20 mL of Et2O was added dropwise to a suspension of Ph3SnCl (10.51 g, 29.85 mmol) in 50 mL of Et2O at 0 ºC. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at this temperature, allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 2.5 h. The reaction mixture was then placed in an ice bath and quenched with 25 mL of chilled degassed water. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous fraction extracted with (3 × 15 mL) Et2O. The collected organic layer was then dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to yield a colourless viscous product. NMR data (1H,
