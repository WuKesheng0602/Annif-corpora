   Through  a  social  construction  theoretical  framework,  it  is  explored  how  the  Immigration  and   Refugee  Board  utilizes  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  as  a  measure  of  credibility  during  the  refugee   determination  process,  and  how  this  is  deemed  problematic  due  to  the  barriers  that  exist  for   the  refugee  population  in  the  mental  health  system.  This  research  project  was  framed  around   two  primary  research  questions:  (1)  how  does  a  mental  health  diagnosis  of  PTSD  impact  the   refugee  determination  process  in  Canada?  And,  (2)  is  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  for  a  refugee  claimant   accurate  and  appropriate?  Semi-structured  elite  interviews  were  conducted  with  health  care   professionals  who  interact  with  the  refugee  population  in  Toronto.  The  findings  indicate  that   there  is  an  identifiable  paradox  between  PTSD  being  utilized  as  a  measure  of  credibility  and   PTSD  being  a  social  construction  that  is  rendered  inappropriate  for  individuals  who  originate  in   a  non-Western  culture.  This  research  project  demonstrates  the  existence  of  the  paradox  by   analyzing  the  multi-faceted  barriers  that  refugee  claimants  face  in  proving  that  their  stories  are   credible,  and  the  barriers  in  the  accessibility  and  delivery  of  mental  health  care  in  Canada.

"The asylum process, like any form of mass adjudication of individual cases, tends to flatten out difference, demand simplicity over nuance, and compel the distillation of messy, complicated lives down to a manageable set of narrative fragments that can be inserted into the legal pigeonholes of the refugee definition" (Macklin, 2009, p.137). 1.  Introduction   1.1  Research  Background      At  the  end  of  2013,  the  United  Nation's  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNCHR)  annual  Global   Trends  report  showed  that  over  fifty-one  million  people  were  forcibly  displaced  Â­  which  is  six   million  more  than  the  reported  amount  at  the  end  of  2012  (UNHCR,  2013).     "We  are  seeing  here  the  immense  costs  of  not  ending  wars,  of  failing  to   resolve  or  prevent  conflict,  [...]  political  solutions  are  vitally  needed.  Without   this,  the  alarming  level  of  conflict  and  the  mass  suffering  that  is  reflected  in   theses  figures  will  continue"  (UNHCR,  2013).     Among  the  forcibly  displaced  there  are  over  one  million  people  seeking  asylum  and  claiming   refugee  status.  Although  the  developing  world  is  host  to  over  four-fifths  of  the  world's   refugees,  the  majority  of  applications  for  asylum  are  submitted  in  developed  countries,   including  Canada  (UNHCR,  2013).  Canada  has  a  long  history  of  providing  a  safe  harbor  to   refugees  as  a  part  of  fulfilling  its  humanitarian  obligation  to  the  international  community.   However,  a  country  once  praised  for  its  bleeding  heart  is  currently  facing  scrutiny:  "All   Canadians  must  now  understand  that  our  humanitarian  tradition  and  our  openness  towards   refugees  are  historic  artifacts"  (Dauvergne,  2013,  para.11).  It  is  argued,  "it  is  easy  to  dismiss  the  

  

1  

current  debate  about  changes  to  Canada's  refugee  process  as  the  same-old  stand-off  between   the  soft  liberal  left  and  a  strong  reformist  government.  But  the  tenor  of  the  recent  changes  has   irrevocably  altered  the  terrain"  (Dauvergne,  2013,  para.2).        At  the  end  of  2012,  the  Conservative  government  made  drastic  changes  to  the  Canadian  

refugee  determination  system,  in  accordance  with  Bill  C-31  Â­  Protecting  Canada's  Immigration   System  Act.  The  reform  introduced  new  anti-smuggling  provisions,  designated  countries  of   origin,  and  unfair  timelines  for  refugee  claims  (Canadian  Council  for  Refugees,  2012).  The   logistics  of  the  system  will  be  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  sub-section  1.3.2.      It  is  argued  that  the  changes  are  based  upon  a  `bogus'  discourse  regarding  refugee  

claimants  that  has  been  disseminated  by  the  Conservative  government.  The  discourse  creates  a   binary  between  the  `good'  refugee  and  the  `bad'  refugee.  It  appears  that  the  discourse  of  the   nation-state  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  asylum  seekers.  It  is  reported  that  "in  total,  Canada   received  half  as  many  asylum  claims  in  the  first  half  of  [2013]  as  it  did  during  the  same  period  of   [2012]  Â­  4,558  compared  to  10,375"  (Cohen,  2013).  And,  once  claims  are  made,  it  is  reported   that  there  has  been  "a  general  decline  in  refugee  acceptance  rates  which  may  be  correlated   with  shifts  in  the  focus  of  refugee  policy"  (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014,  p.4).  As  an  extension  of  this,  it  is   noted  that  the  changes  to  the  refugee  determination  process  has  resulted  in  increased   demands  on  refugees  to  prove  credibility,  or  rather,  to  prove  that  they  are  a  `good'  refugee   (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014).  Thus,  in  this  way  it  becomes  the  refugee  claimant's  responsibility  to  prove   that  their  story  is  one  that  makes  them  worthy  of  protection.  And,  this  is  particularly  difficult   when  the  humanitarian  mandate  of  the  state  is  being  replaced  by  a  discourse  that  portrays  the   asylum  seeker  as  "fraudulent".

Although  the  refugee  determination  process  is  multi-faceted,  it  is  reported  "lawyers  and  

asylum  seekers  are  drawing  on  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  as  a  vehicle  toward  credibility   and  access  to  Canada"  (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014,  p.6).  The  appropriateness  of  using  post-traumatic   stress  disorder  as  a  measure  of  credibility  for  a  refugee  claim  has  materialized  as  a  new  issue  in   refugee  research.  The  importance  of  this  research  project  can  be  identified  as  expanding  on  the   new  literature,  particularly  a  recent  research  paper  published  by  the  Policy  Development  and   Evaluation  Service  of  the  UNHCR,  concerning  the  relationship  between  post-traumatic  stress   disorder  and  the  refugee  determination  system.  This  study  adds  to  the  existing  literature  by   drawing  on  qualitative  data  collected  through  semi-structured  elite  interviews  with  health  care   professionals  who  interact  closely  with  the  refugee  population  in  Toronto.  This  research  project   provides  a  unique  perspective  from  the  service  provider  on  barriers  for  refugees  in  accessing   mental  health  services.   1.2  Research  Questions      This  research  project  is  framed  around  two  primary  research  questions:  (1)  how  does  a   mental  health  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  impact  the  refugee  determination   process  in  Canada?  And,  (2)  is  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  for  a  refugee   claimant  accurate  and  appropriate?      To  address  these  questions,  I  seek  to  explore  the  emerging  phenomenon  of  a  mental  

health  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  being  used  as  a  symbol  of  credibility  in  the   refugee  determination  process.  And,  I  seek  to  identify  the  barriers  that  exist  for  the  refugee   population  in  the  mental  health  system  and  how  this  impacts  the  validity  of  a  diagnosis  for   someone  who  originates  from  a  non-Western  culture.

1.3  Terms  and  Definitions      For  the  purposes  of  this  paper,  it  is  important  to  have  a  comprehensive  understanding   of  three  entities:  the  refugee  claimant,  the  refugee  determination  system  and  post-traumatic   stress  disorder.     1.3.1  The  Refugee  Claimant      It  is  important  to  note  that  there  will  be  a  focus  on  a  refugee  claimant  rather  than  a   Convention  refugee.  A  Convention  refugee  is  a  person  who  meets  the  refugee  definition  in  the   1951  Geneva  Convention  relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees.  To  meet  the  definition,  "a  person   must  be  outside  their  country  of  origin  and  have  a  well  founded  fear  of  being  persecuted  for   reasons  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  of  a  particular  social  group  or  political   opinion"  (Canadian  Council  for  Refugees,  n.d).  They  are  government-assisted  or  privately   sponsored  refugees.  A  refugee  claimant,  often  referred  to  internationally  as  an  asylum  seeker,   is  "a  person  who  has  made  a  claim  for  protection  as  a  refugee  [...]  and  until  a  determination  is   made,  it  is  impossible  to  say  whether  the  asylum  seeker  is  a  refugee  or  not"  (Canadian  Council   for  Refugees,  n.d).  This  distinction  follows  the  notion  that  the  Convention  refugee  is  a  `good'   refugee,  and  an  asylum  seeker  is  a  `bad'  refugee.     1.3.2  The  Refugee  Determination  System      The  Canadian  refugee  determination  system  underwent  changes  in  December  2012  as  a   result  of  the  coming  into  force  of  the  Balanced  Refugee  Reform  Act  and  the  Protecting  Canada's   Immigration  System  Act.  For  the  purposes  of  this  paper  there  will  be  a  focus  on  refugee  claims   made  at  a  `port  of  entry'  rather  than  `inland  claims'.  Upon  arrival,  a  Canadian  Border  Services

Agency  officer  will  determine  whether  a  claimant  fulfills  the  eligibility  criteria.  If  the  claim  is   found  eligible,  the  person  will  receive  a  refugee  claimant  identity  document,  a  date  for  a   refugee  hearing  at  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board,  a  Basis  of  Claim  form,  and  a  conditional   removal  order.  The  refugee  hearing  will  take  place  within  forty-five  days  and  sixty  days,  for   claimants  from  a  Designated  Country  of  Origin,  and  for  other  claimants,  respectively.  It  is  the   responsibility  of  the  Refugee  Protection  Division  of  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  to   decide  the  outcome  of  the  refugee  claim  (Macklin,  2009).  Although  the  refugee  determination   process  is  a  multi-faceted  and  complex  process,  this  paper  will  focus  on  the  Basis  of  Claim   document,  and  the  attached  documentary  evidence.  More  specifically,  there  will  be  a  focus  on   the  psychiatric  report  as  an  attached  document.     1.3.3  Post-traumatic  Stress  Disorder        There  will  be  a  primary  focus  on  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  as  the  dominant  mental   health  diagnosis  that  is  found  on  the  psychiatric  report  for  the  refugee  determination  process.     Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  was  first  recognized  as  a  mental  disorder  in  the  third   version  of  the  Diagnostic  Statistical  Manual  (DSM)  in  1980.  The  fifth  version  of  the  DSM,   released  May  2013,  identifies  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  as  a  Trauma-and  Stressor-Related   Disorder,  as  opposed  to  an  Anxiety  Disorder,  as  it  was  originally  classified  (American  Psychiatric   Association,  2013).  In  order  for  an  individual  to  be  warranted  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic   stress  disorder,  they  must  meet  the  criteria  listed  in  the  DSM,  which  has  been  altered  since   version  three.  Currently,  the  individual  must  have  been  subjected  to  a  trigger  and  must   manifest  a  response,  both  of  which  are  defined  in  accordance  with  specific  characteristics.  The   trigger  must  entail  exposure  to  actual  or  threatened  death,  serious  injury  or  sexual  violation

(American  Psychiatric  Association,  2013).  The  individual  must  directly  experience,  witness,  learn   about,  or  be  subjected  to  repeated  exposure  to  the  traumatic  event  (American  Psychiatric   Association,  2013).  In  addition,  the  traumatic  event  must  cause  a  response  that  impairs  normal   functioning  and  lasts  the  duration  of  more  than  one  moth,  and  encompasses  the  experience  of   intrusion,  avoidance,  alterations  in  mood,  and  alterations  in  arousal  (American  Psychiatric   Association,  2013).  It  is  reported  that  the  frequency  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  among   the  refugee  population  ranges  from  thirty  nine  to  one  hundred  percent,  compared  to  one   percent  of  the  general  population  (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014).

2.  Theoretical  Framework  and  Scholarly  Context      In  seeking  to  understand  the  impact  of  a  mental  health  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic   stress  disorder  on  the  refugee  determination  process,  this  chapter  explores  the  over-arching,   multi-faceted  theoretical  framework  and  the  existing  scholarly  literature.     2.1  Social  Construction      At  the  top  of  the  theoretical  framework  hierarchy  is  social  construction.  For  the   purposes  of  this  paper,  the  refugee  claimant,  mental  illness,  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder   will  be  analyzed  through  a  social  construction  theoretical  lens.        Social  construction  is  often  described  alongside  relativism,  and  is  compared  to  realism.  

A  primary  assumption  of  realism  is  that  reality  is  self-evident  and  stable,  and  that  knowledge  is   purely  rational.  This  assumption  is  based  on  the  premise  that  there  is  "a  real  world  out  there   and  that  scientific  methods  and  reliance  on  systematic  observation  and  experimentation  [are]   capable  of  giving  us  objective  knowledge  about  that  world"  (Fletcher,  1996,  p.409).  However,   social  constructionists  argue  that  reality  is  not  something  that  is  naturally  given;  rather,  "the   world  is  largely  created  by  the  human  mind"  and  knowledge  is  "derived  from  the  societal   context"  (Fletcher,  1996,  p.410).  Thus,  reality  is  an  invention  that  is  constantly  negotiated  and   modified.  The  following  sub-sections  will  describe  how  the  refugee  claimant,  mental  illness  and   post-traumatic  stress  disorder  are  social  constructions,  rather  than  entities  that  are  objective   truths.     2.2  Social  Construction:  the  Refugee  Claimant     

  

7  

The  social  construction  of  the  refugee  claimant  is  best  described  using  the  concept  of   refugeeness.  For  the  purposes  of  this  research  project,  there  is  a  focus  on  the  trajectory  of  the   refugee  subjectivity  from  their  country  of  origin  to  the  country  of  asylum.  The  fleeing   individual's  past  subjectivity  is  subordinated  to  a  new  subjectivity  Â­  that  of  a  refugee  claimant   (Lacroix,  2004).  Although  an  individual  has  a  multi-faceted  subjectivity,  it  can  be  argued  that  the   refugee's  most  prominent  subjectivity  upon  claiming  asylum  is  that  of  refugeeness.  An   individual  is  stripped  of  their  past  subjectivity  and  becomes  a  refugee  claimant,  who  is  required   to  prove  their  refugeeness  when  they  are  confronted  with  a  refugee  determination  process   (Lacroix,  2004). The  Canadian  refugee  determination  system  is  built  upon  the  premise  that  asylum   seekers  must  prove  that  they  meet  the  standard  of  proof  for  refugee  status.  The  criterion  for   refugee  status  is  outlined  in  the  1951  Refugee  Convention  and  the  1967  Protocol  Relating  to   the  Status  of  Refugees  (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014).  However,  there  ceases  to  a  national  or   international  convention  that  stipulates  credibility  as  a  necessary  requirement.  Nonetheless,  as   cited  in  Gojer  &  Ellis,  2012,  "credibility  is  always  an  issue...the  majority  of  claims  are  determined   on  the  basis  of  a  subjective  analysis,  [of]  whether  or  not  the  panel  believes  the  claimants  story"   (Pieters,  2004,  p.1).  The  notion  of  credibility  is  often  measured  during  "the  trauma  transmission   process  during  the  hearing,  which  entails  both  a  reenactment  by  the  claimant  of  the  harm   influenced  upon  him/her,  and  the  capacity  of  the  adjudicator  to  share  and  understand  the   Other's  experience"  (Rousseau  &  Foxen,  2010,  p.71).  This  is  described  as  a  difficult  process   because  there  are  so  many  "barriers  standing  between  [the  adjudicator]  and  `what  really   happened'"  (Macklin,  1998,  p.137).  The  ability  to  determine  credibility  is  often  hindered

because  "assorted  governmental  and  human  rights  reports  that  the  [Immigration  and  Refugee   Board]  receive  usually  paint  a  canvas  with  broad,  crude  brush  strokes.  They  rarely  provide  the   kind  of  detailed  information  that  would  be  necessary  to  corroborate  a  particular  story"   (Macklin,  1998,  p.137).     In  Canada,  it  is  reported  that  there  has  been  a  general  decline  in  refugee  acceptance   rates,  which  may  be  correlated  with  shifts  in  the  culture  towards  refugee  claimants.  The  `bogus'   discourse  that  has  emerged  regarding  asylum  seekers  is  linked  to  the  notion  of  credibility,   whereby  the  refugee  claimant  must  demonstrate  that  they  are  genuine.     Although  "to  seek  asylum  is  a  universal  right  possessed  by  all  individuals,  the  right  to   grant  asylum  is  maintained  by  sovereign  states  and  their  apparatus  of  inclusion/exclusion"   (Nyers,  2002,  p.53).  The  sovereignty  of  the  nation-state  is  at  the  forefront  of  discussions   regarding  the  movement  of  migrants.  Consequently,  the  culture  of  the  Immigration  and   Refugee  Board  radiates  around  the  notion  that  as  decision  makers,  and  as  gatekeepers,  they   are  tasked  with  "protecting  Canada's  borders  from  unscrupulous  and  underserving  migrants   who  abuse  the  asylum  system  to  gain  entry"  (Macklin,  2009,  p.158).  Because  this  environment   is  characterized  by  a  "pervasive  suspicion  regarding  asylum  seekers"  and  a  "presumptive   skepticism"  it  is  of  utmost  importance  that  the  decision  maker  is  satisfied  that  the  refugee   claimant  meets  the  criteria  of  what  it  means  to  be  a  refugee  (Macklin,  2009,  p.159).  And,  it  is   the  concept  of  refugeeness  that  becomes  interlinked  with  credibility.     To  determine  credibility  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  asks  `What  happened  to   you?'  which  is  inherently  linked  to  the  question:  `Who  is  a  refugee?'  Alongside  these  questions   is  the  dichotomy  of  the  `good'  refugee  and  the  `bad'  refugee.  In  order  to  be  a  `good'  refugee,

the  refugee  claimant  subjectivity  is  transformed  into  refugeeness.  Refugeeness  is  an   expectation  of  how  a  refugee  should  look  and  act  and  implies  certain  social  and  moral  conduct   rendered  to  be  appropriate  for  a  refugee  (Narula,  2013).  From  the  moment  that  an  individual   becomes  a  refugee  claimant,  they  begin  the  process  of  repeating  their  story  Â­  "on  each   occasion  translated,  summarized,  reworked,  massaged  and  interpreted  by  the  recipient,  and  all   the  time  adding  to  an  every  growing  bureaucratic  record  of  their  experiences  before  and  during   flight"  (Zajor,  2011,  p.22).  As  cited  in  Zajor,  2011,  their  story  must  fit  the  image  of  the  `good'   refugee  Â­  likened  to  "hordes  of  nameless,  despairing,  and  dispirited  masses  [...]  desolate  and   pitiful"  (Matua,  2011,  p.9).  "The  refugee  who  displays  too  much  autonomy  is  portrayed  as   duplicitous,  a  queue  jumper,  opportunist  and  liar,  weaving  tall  tales  to  trick  the  authorities  and   therefore  lacks  the  requisite  genuineness"  (Zajor,  2011,  p.12).  Thus,  it  becomes  a  logical   argument  that  the  refugee  claimants  who  are  `recognized'  as  `good'  refugees  "may  be  those   most  adept  at  positioning  themselves  within  the  dominant  discourse  of  powerlessness,  needing   to  be  saved  by  the  `good'  state"  (Zajor,  2011,  p.9).  Refugeeness,  as  a  social  construction,  is  a   byproduct  of  Canada's  immigration  and  refugee  policy,  and  more  specifically,  the  refugee   determination  process.     Because  a  `good'  refugee  is  helpless,  weak,  and  vulnerable  Â­  the  refugee  claimant   subjectivity  must  become  defined  by  these  characteristics.  An  emerging  body  of  scholarly   literature  has  established  links  between  the  notion  of  credibility  and  a  mental  health  diagnosis   of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.    Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  becomes  the  label  that   symbolizes  the  suffering  of  the  `good'  refugee.  It  is  claimed  that  the  Immigration  and  Refugee   Board  is  "inadvertently  using  the  language  and  ideology  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  as  a  

  

10  

measuring  stick  to  determine  the  credibility  of  asylum  seekers"  (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014,  p.2).  This   means  that  decision  makers  are  increasingly  drawing  on  "medical  evidence  to  discern  between   the  credible-good  refugee  and  the  malingering-bad  refugee"  (Gojer  &  Ellis,  2014,  p.17).  In  short,   post-traumatic  stress  equals  credibility.   2.3  Social  Construction:  Mental  Illness      However,  an  emerging  body  of  scholarly  literature  has  identified  the  problems  that  are   associated  with  diagnosing  an  individual  who  originated  in  a  non-Western  culture  with  a  mental   disorder  diagnosis.  This  argument  is  based  on  the  notion  that  mental  illness  is  a  social   construction,  whereby  mental  illness  is  "inseparable  from  the  cultural  models  that  define  them   as  such"  and  "the  defining  characteristics  of  mental  illness  reside  in  the  cultural  rules  that   define  what  is  normal  or  abnormal"  (Horwitz,  2002,  p.6).     A  realist  approach  is  inherently  linked  to  the  biomedical  model  of  mental  illness  that   assumes  that  the  manifestation  of  a  mental  illness  is  consistent  across  every  population  due  to   the  universal  physiology  of  mankind  (Thakker,  Ward  &  Strongman,  1999).  The  DSM,  the   psychiatric  screening  tool  used  in  Western  culture,  is  based  upon  the  biomedical  model.  The   DSM  is  a  classification  system  based  on  a  set  of  symptom-based  criteria  that  are  claimed  to  be   objective  (Kirk,  Gomory  &  Cohen,  2013).    Mental  illnesses,  according  to  the  DSM,  are  universal,   cross-culturally  valid  and  invariant  to  time  or  place  (Kienzler,  2008).     The  social  construction  of  mental  illness  is  not  a  new  phenomenon:  a  number  of   scholars  have  refuted  a  realist  approach  in  favour  of  the  social  constructivist  perspective.  The   origins  of  this  framework  began  with  Emile  Durkheim  who  transformed  the  object  of   sociological  analysis  from  individual  behaviours  to  the  cultural  systems  that  define  the  meaning  

  

11  

of  the  behaviours  (Horwitz,  2002,  p.7).  Ruth  Benedict  asserted,  "Normality  thus  resides  in   culturally  approved  conventions,  not  in  universal  psychological  standards  of  appropriate   functioning"  because  the  behaviours  that  are  defined  by  the  Western  psychiatric  model  as   abnormal  can  be  considered  normal  in  other  cultures  (Horwitz,  2002,  p.7).  Michael  Foucault   viewed  "madness  as  a  property  of  cultural  categories  rather  than  of  individual  symptoms"   (Horwitz,  2002,  p.8).  Thomas  Scheff  extended  the  social  constructivist  perspective  into   American  sociology  by  introducing  the  notion  that  psychiatric  symptoms  are  norm-violating   behaviours  specific  to  a  culture  rather  than  intrapsychic  disturbances  within  individuals   (Horwitz,  2002,  p.8).  Thomas  Szasz,  a  primary  opponent  of  the  realist  approach  draws  on  an   analogy  between  mental  illness  and  witchcraft.  In  short,  "witchcraft  and  mental  illness  are   imprecise  and  all-encompassing  concepts,  freely  adaptable  to  whatever  uses  the  priest  or   physician  wishes  to  put  them"  (Szasz,  1970,  p.1).  Alongside  these  arguments,  in  summary,   social  constructionists  question  the  factual  status  of  mental  illness  and  instead,  claim  that  in   accordance  with  the  Western  psychiatric  model  mental  illnesses  are  not  discovered,  rather  they   are  invented  (Szasz,  1974).   2.4  Social  Construction:  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder      In  accordance  with  the  social  construction  of  mental  illness,  it  appears  that  this   framework  can  be  extended  to  the  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.  There  is  an   ongoing  debate  within  scholarly  literature  regarding  the  conceptualization  of  the  refugee   experience,  especially  with  the  emerging  trend  of  transforming  the  experience  of  trauma  into   post-traumatic  stress  disorder.    

  

12  

The  realist  approach  endorses  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  as  a  cross-culturally  valid   psychopathological  response  to  traumatic  distress,  which  can  be  ameliorated  with  Western   clinical  techniques  (Kienzler,  2008).    Because  the  DSM  supplies  a  checklist  of  the  criteria   attributed  to  a  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  diagnosis,  the  realist  presumes  that  every   individual  will  elicit  the  identical  physiological  reaction  to  stress.  Thereby,  Western  realist   psychiatrists  have  a  worldview  that  privileges  biology  over  culture  (Eisenbruch,  1991).  And,  at   the  heart  of  this  perception  is  that  it  is  normal  to  be  traumatized  if  one  is  a  `good'  refugee,  and   this  traumatization  merits  a  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  diagnosis  (Kienzler,  2008).     However,  the  social  construction  framework  poses  this  as  erroneous;  a  noteworthy   amount  of  literature  suggests  that  mental  illnesses  are  not  spread  evenly  across  the  globe.     Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  described  as  a  `transient  mental  illness',  or  rather,  a  disorder   that  is  located  in  a  particular  set  of  cultural  understandings  (Hacking,  1998).  The   conceptualization  of  trauma  is  based  on  cultural  perceptions  of  the  manifestation  of  `normality'   (Kienzler,  2008).  The  notion  of  `normality'  embodies  certain  questions:  what  is  a  reasonable   risk;  what  is  acceptable  behaviour  at  a  time  of  crisis;  and,  how  should  distressed  be  expressed   (Summerfield,  2001).  It  can  be  argued  that  due  to  the  criteria  posited  by  the  DSM  for  a  post- traumatic  stress  disorder  diagnosis,  the  answers  to  these  questions  could  be  answered  as  if  all   individuals  exposed  to  a  traumatic  event  are  a  homogenous  group.  The  social  construction   framework  would  argue  that  this  assumption  is  false.  The  literature  identifies  the  notion  of   cultural  bereavement  as  a  beneficial  alternative  to  understanding  the  trauma  experienced  by  a   refugee  claimant  (Eisenbruch,  1991).  Cultural  bereavement  denotes  the  experience  of  trauma  

  

13  

not  as  a  disease,  but  as  an  understandable  response  to  a  catastrophic  event,  and  that  the   response  is  manifested  according  to  the  norms  of  one's  culture  (Eisenbruch,  1991).   It  is  argued  that  the  refugee  experience,  which  often  coincides  with  a  traumatic  event,   has  become  "subsumed  by  a  medical  etiology  of  trauma  that  is  static,  de-racialized,  and  value   neutral"  (Chu,  2008).  The  Western  "psychiatric  sciences  have  sought  to  convert  human  misery   and  pain  into  technical  problems  that  can  be  understood  in  standardized  ways"  (Summerfield,   2001,  p.4).  Because  of  this,  it  is  cautioned  "human  pain  is  a  slippery  thing"  and  "how  it  is   registered  and  measured  depends  on  philosophical  and  socio-moral  considerations  that  evolve   over  time  and  cannot  simply  be  reduced  to  [...]  compartmentalized  diagnostic  categories  which   have  become  legitimized  through  the  language  of  mental  health  and  the  DSM"  (Gojer  &  Ellis,   2014,  p.7).     The  social  construction  framework  claims  that  the  medicalized  trauma  discourse   embedded  within  the  Western  psychiatric  model  is  based  upon  erroneous  assumptions.  Some   scholars  go  as  far  to  argue  "post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  a  narrowly  defined  social   constructed  psychiatric  category  that  fails  to  capture  a  holistic  view  of  people's  trauma  and   should  not  be  utilized  as  a  tool  to  measure  the  credibility  of  refugee  trauma"  (Gojer  &  Ellis,   2014,  p.6).  Correspondingly,  it  is  cautioned  that  it  would  be  unfortunate  if  post-traumatic  stress   disorder  was  recognized  as  a  signifier  of  past  suffering,  because  there  is  the  risk  that  the  stories   of  victims  who  could  not  obtain  a  diagnosis  would  not  be  believed  (Summerfield,  2001).   2.5  The  Settlement  System  in  Canada      In  addition  to  the  social  construction  theoretical  framework,  it  is  important  to  provide   information  on  the  current  state  of  the  immigration  and  refugee  settlement  system  in  Canada.

There  are  barriers  for  newcomers  in  receiving  settlement  services;  and,  upon  further   exploration  it  is  evident  that  this  is  a  systemic  issue  that  has  radiated  down  to  frontline  services.     According  to  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Canada,  the  operation  of  the  settlement   system  is  the  responsibility  of  the  federal  government,  the  provincial  government  and  the  non- for-profit  sector  (Sadiq,  2004).  However,  it  is  argued  that  because  "neither  the  federal   government  nor  the  provincial  government  provides  services  to  newcomers"  (Sadiq,  2004,   p.23),  the  municipalities  undertake  the  bulk  of  settlement  work  (McGrath  &  McGrath,  2013).   However,  this  is  problematic;  as  cited  in  the  literature  Canada's  settlement  system  follows  the   notion  of  the  shadow  state  whereby  settlement  services  are  funded  through  contractual   agreements  between  the  nation-state  and  the  non-for-profit  sector  (Sadiq,  2004).  Thus,  "the   supply  of  newcomer  services  is  directly  affected  by  settlement  funding"  from  the  federal   government  (Sadiq,  2004,  p.13).     Regrettably,  the  number  and  breadth  of  newcomer  services  has  been  influenced  by   federal  funding  cutbacks  (Sadiq,  2004).  In  2010  the  federal  government  announced  that  583   million  dollars  would  be  allocated  to  settlement  services  in  Canada  for  2011-2012,  compared  to   622  million  dollars  in  the  prior  year;  and  for  2012-2013  the  total  would  decline  to  577  million   dollars  (Elliott  &  Payton,  2011).  And,  the  majority  of  the  funding  has  been  cut  from  Ontario's   settlement  system,  compared  to  the  other  provinces  (Keung,  2010).  In  doing  so,  the  smaller   immigrant  settlement  agencies  are  the  most  affected;  thus  eliminating  the  culturally  and   linguistically  sensitive  services  that  are  critical  to  the  integration  process  (Sadiq,  2004).  The   research  is  consistent  that  receiving  settlement  services,  including  assistance  with  language,   employment,  housing,  and  education,  is  a  significant  factor  in  the  success  of  newcomers.  And,  it  

  

15  

is  the  local  municipalities  and  the  not-for-profit  sector  that  allows  for  the  flexibility  and   innovation  of  these  services  in  order  to  meet  the  unique  needs  of  the  newcomer  population   (McGrath  &  McGrath,  2013).

3.  Methodology      In  seeking  to  provide  answers  to  the  research  questions  described  in  section  1.2,  this   research  project  utilized  a  qualitative  research  design  that  involves  semi-structured  elite   interviews  with  health  care  professionals  who  interact  with  the  refugee  population  in  Toronto.   The  data  analysis  is  rooted  in  grounded  theory,  whereby  distinct  themes  emerge  and  linkages   are  established.   3.1  Research  Instrument      The  research  design  for  the  purposes  of  this  project,  as  mentioned  previously,  is  based   upon  semi-structured  elite  interviews  with  health  care  professionals  in  Toronto.  The   participants  will  be  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  section  3.2.  Elite  interviews  are  valuable  for   the  collection  of  specialized  information:  the  ability  to  extract  detailed  and  otherwise   inaccessible  information  is  heightened.  A  semi-structured  interview  design  encompasses  a   previously  constructed  framework  of  questions  that  draws  upon  themes  of  interest.  A  pre-set   framework  is  intended  to  ensure  that  the  core  questions  are  asked  in  each  interview,  but  still   allows  for  flexibility  in  the  participants  answers  to  be  retained  (Archer  &  Berdahl,  2011).  The   framework  consists  of  open-ended  questions  that  allow  for  the  emergence  of  new  ideas,  and   the  ability  to  ask  for  clarification,  elaboration,  and  additional  information  that  may  be  of  use.   Because  this  research  design  involves  the  interaction  with  human  beings,  it  had  to  be   approved  under  the  merits  of  the  Tri-Council  Policy  Statement:  Ethical  Conduct  for  Research   Involving  Human  beings  (TCPS)  by  the  Research  Ethics  Board  at  Ryerson  University.  This  study   was  conducted  parallel  to  ethical  principles.  Because  the  participants,  by  definition,  were  not  

  

17  

considered  a  vulnerable  population,  the  two  primary  ethical  considerations  were  to  ensure   free,  informed  and  ongoing  consent,  and  confidentiality.     3.2  Participants  and  Recruitment      At  the  forefront  of  the  research  design  is  the  human  subject;  it  is  of  great  importance  to   choose  the  potential  participants  based  on  their  ability  to  supply  specialized  information  that   can  be  used  to  address  the  research  questions  (Archer  &  Berdahl,  2011).  For  the  purposes  of   this  research  project  it  was  initially  determined  that  primary  care  physicians  that  work  directly   with  the  refugee  population  would  be  the  most  appropriate  participants,  but  in  order  to   incorporate  additional  perspectives  across  the  mental  health  care  spectrum,  this  category  was   subsequently  expanded  to  include  nurse  practitioners  and  psychiatrists.  All  of  the  participants   work  in  the  downtown  core  of  Toronto.  The  participant  screening  process  entailed  two  main   criteria:  direct  interaction  with  refugees  for  the  purposes  of  mental  health  and  specialized   knowledge  regarding  mental  health  diagnosis.  The  decision  to  interview  health  care   professionals  rather  than  refugee  claimants,  settlement  workers,  lawyers,  or  members  of  the   Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  was  based  upon  the  desire  to  collect  information  from  the   individuals  who  are  responsible  for  applying  the  mental  health  diagnosis  upon  the  refugee   claimant.  The  health  care  professionals  who  interact  with  the  refugee  population  have  unique   insight  into  the  barriers  that  are  associated  with  applying  a  mental  health  diagnosis.  This   research  project  also  offers  a  unique  perspective  of  the  service  provider,  rather  than  of  the   service  user.     The  participants  were  recruited  through  a  purposive  sampling  strategy.  Because  of  the   time  restraints,  purposive  sampling  ensured  that  subjects  who  were  sought  to  participate  

  

18  

would  provide  the  greatest  amount  of  information  (Archer  &  Berdahl,  2011).  To  begin  this   process,  the  key  informant  technique  was  utilized,  whereby  an  individual  deeply  immersed   within  the  refugee  mental  health  environment  as  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the   Canadian  Centre  for  Victims  of  Torture  and  the  Manager  of  the  Health  Equity  Department  at   the  Centre  for  Addiction  and  Mental  Health  provided  guidance  to  the  most  appropriate   subjects.  The  subjects  contact  information  was  accessed  through  public  websites  of  the   respective  hospitals  or  community  clinics,  such  as  the  Cross  Road's  Clinic,  St.  Michael's  Hospital,   and  Mount  Sinai  Hospital,  or  through  contacting  the  respective  organizations  that  they  were   employed  by,  such  as  Access  Alliance,  the  Canadian  Centre  for  Victims  of  Torture,  and  the   Centre  for  Addiction  and  Mental  Health.  The  potential  subjects  were  delivered  an  email  script   that  requested  their  participation  in  the  study  and  clarified  the  purpose  of  the  interview.  Upon   their  response  and  their  approval  to  participate  in  the  research  project,  the  date,  time  and   location  were  decided  based  upon  availability.  The  research  design  sought  to  recruit  eight  to   ten  participants,  and  all  of  the  fourteen  potential  participants  who  were  contacted  responded,   but  due  to  time  restraints  nine  health  care  professionals  were  successfully  recruited  and   interviewed  in  this  research  project.  This  included  five  primary  care  physicians,  three   psychiatrists,  and  one  nurse  practitioner.       3.3  Data  Collection        The  semi-structured  elite  interviews  were  conducted  during  a  four-week  time  span.  The   length  of  the  interviews  ranged  between  nine  minutes  and  twenty-five  minutes,  with  an   average  of  eighteen  minutes.  In  order  to  standardize  the  research  instrument,  the  interviews   were  conducted  face  to  face  at  the  participant's  place  of  work.  Furthermore,  three  interviews  

  

19  

were  conducted  on  the  telephone  to  provide  an  additional  perspective.  The  interview  consisted   of  a  pre-set  framework  that  contained  ten  open-ended  questions.  The  questions  incorporated   the  following  themes:  the  characteristics  of  the  refugee  population  in  Toronto;  the  language   and  cultural  barriers;  the  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  using  the  DSM  with  the  refugee   population  in  North  America;  the  accuracy  of  a  mental  health  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress   disorder;  the  treatment  approaches  utilized  with  the  refugee  population;  the  measures  that   should  be  implemented  for  the  improvement  of  the  accessibility  and  delivery  of  service   provision  and  health  care;  and  the  interaction  between  the  mental  health  system  and  the   refugee  determination  system.  As  consented  by  the  participants,  each  interview  was  audio- recorded.  Following  the  completion  of  an  interview,  the  content  was  transcribed  verbatim  for   the  purpose  of  data  analysis.     3.4  Data  Analysis      The  data  analysis  for  the  research  project  is  based  upon  the  face-to-face  interviews  and   is  rooted  in  grounded  theory.  It  begins  with  meticulously  reading  through  the  transcriptions  and   with  the  process  of  coding.  The  process  entails  the  completion  of  three  sequential  phases:  open   coding,  axial  coding  and  selective  coding  (Birks  &  Mills,  2011).  First,  in  open  coding,  a  thorough   analysis  is  conducted  of  the  collected  data.  This  results  in  the  segmentation  of  information  to   form  categories  based  upon  noticeable  patters  (Birks  &  Mills,  2011).  Initially,  the  categories  that   emerged  during  open  coding  were  almost  parallel  to  the  themes  that  were  incorporated  in  the   questions  being  asked:  refugee  characteristics,  language  barriers,  cultural  barriers,  the   appropriateness  of  the  DSM  and  the  cross-cultural  accuracy  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,   and  the  treatment  approaches.

Second,  in  axial  coding,  the  data  is  assembled  in  novel  ways  following  the  open  coding   process.  This  exercise  results  in  the  development  of  conceptual  patterns  in  the  analysis  (Birks  &   Mills,  2011).  As  the  interviews  and  data  analysis  proceeded,  the  axial  coding  began  Â­  the   participants,  with  the  usage  of  probes,  continuously  made  references  to  the  relationship   between  the  notion  of  credibility,  the  refugee  determination  process,  and  a  diagnosis  of  post- traumatic  stress  disorder.  As  a  result,  the  refugee  determination  system  was  established  as  a   separate  category,  in  addition  to:  characteristics  of  the  refugee  population,  systemic  barriers,   language  barriers,  cultural  barriers,  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  the  DSM,  the   appropriateness  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  and  treatment  approaches.     Lastly,  in  selective  coding,  the  saturation  of  categories  is  sought,  whereby  upon  further   analysis  the  creation  of  additional  categories  is  not  necessary  (Birks  &  Mills,  2011).  Either  a   `story  line'  emerges  that  details  connections  between  the  categories,  or  propositions  may  be   specified  that  state  predicted  relationships  (Creswell,  2007).  The  result  of  the  qualitative  coding   process  is  a  substantive  level  theory.  As  a  result  of  the  refugee  determination  process  becoming   an  additional  category,  a  `story  line'  began  to  emerge,  whereby  theoretical  connections  were   made  between  the  categories.  By  identifying  the  existing  barriers  in  the  accessibility  and   delivery  of  mental  health  care  to  the  refugee  population,  a  paradox  was  discovered.  The  details   of  the  paradox  will  be  discussed  in  a  later  section.

4.  Data  Analysis      The  themes  that  were  uncovered  in  the  grounded  theory  process  will  be  thoroughly   discussed  in  this  chapter.     4.1  Characteristics  of  the  Refugee  Population      At  the  forefront,  it  is  important  to  have  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  the   demographics  of  the  current  refugee  population  that  the  participants  are  interacting  with.  The   participants  were  asked  about  the  age,  the  gender  and  the  country  of  origin  of  the  refugee   population.  The  aggregated  results  demonstrated  that  the  participants  classified  the  majority  of   the  refugee  population  as  "adults",  ranging  from  middle  life  to  late  life,  from  the  ages  of  thirty- sixty.  They  also  stated  that  although  they  do  see  refugees  who  are  under  the  age  of  eighteen   and  over  the  age  of  sixty,  they  were  often  accompanying  other  family  members  in  the  "adult"   category.  There  was  almost  an  absolute  consensus  among  the  participants  that  there  was  an   equal  amount  of  male  and  female  refugees  that  they  interacted  with.   Lastly,  the  participants  discussed  the  countries  of  origin,  which  were  identified  as  being   constantly  in  flux  because  of  the  "political  decisions  on  who  comes  and  who  does  not"   (Physician,  Male).  The  most  consistent  finding  was  that  although  the  Hungarian  Roma  made  up   sixty  percent  of  the  patients  at  one  time,  this  came  to  a  stop  at  the  end  of  2012.  In  the  first  six   months  of  2013,  it  was  reported  that  North  Koreans  were  the  largest  population;  however,  this   came  to  a  stop  at  the  end  of  2013.  The  remaining  findings  were  scattered  but  included  the   following  countries  of  origin:  Ukraine,  Ethiopia,  Somalia,  Nigeria,  Sudan,  Sir  Leon,  Congo,   Uganda,  Bhutan,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  Iran,  Iraq,  Afghanistan,  Saudi  Arabia,  Sri  Lanka,  Caribbean,   Columbia,  and  Mexico.

4.2  The  Refugee  Determination  Process      During  the  initial  stages  of  the  research  process,  the  refugee  determination  system  was   not  a  theme  that  was  to  be  explored.  However,  as  the  stages  of  data  collection  and  data   analysis  progressed  the  refugee  determination  system  was  identified  as  a  significant   component  when  exploring  refugee  mental  health.  The  majority  of  the  participants  in  their   discussion  identified  a  relationship  between  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and   the  refugee  determination  system.  More  specifically,  there  was  a  consensus  that  labeling   someone  with  a  mental  health  diagnosis,  particularly  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  is  useful   for  the  refugee  determination  process.  And,  if  there  ceases  to  be  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic   stress  disorder  the  refugee  claimant  is  less  likely  to  be  accepted  in  Canada,  thus  it  becomes  "a   risk  to  say  that  someone  has  no  DSM  axis  one  diagnosis"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).     A  large  proportion  of  the  participants  revealed  that  as  health  care  professionals  their   role  is  not  only  the  provision  of  care,  but  "to  write  a  very  specific  psychiatric  report  that  has   been  requested  by  the  lawyer  to  help  with  the  refugee  hearing  process"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).   "For  the  legal  process,  being  able  to  use  a  term  like  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  Â­  it   communicates  something  Â­  it  says  that  this  person  meets  a  certain  criteria  (Physician,  Female).   The  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  "want  facts  and  a  description  [...]  they  want  to  know  does   this  person  have  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  or  do  they  not"  (Physician,  Female).        A  participant  explained  that  there  is  logic  behind  the  relationship  between  post-

traumatic  stress  disorder  and  credibility:  there  is  a  belief  among  the  Immigration  and  Refugee   Board  that  "if  you  are  a  refugee  you  have  to  be  unfortunate,  and  so  you  would  imagine  that  the   more  unfortunate  you  are,  the  more  terrible  your  story  is"  (Physician,  Male).    Thus,  the  

  

23  

diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  symbolizes  that  the  refugee  claimant  has   experienced  trauma  and  has  been  affected  by  it.  "If  somebody  has  had  all  kinds  of  things   happen  and  then  somehow  it  does  not  match  up  in  their  psychiatric  diagnosis  or  presentation   then  people  start  to  have  credibility  problems  with  that  person"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).      The  participants  also  identified  that  the  discourse  surrounding  asylum  seekers  in  Canada  

has  an  impact  on  the  refugee  determination  process.  It  is  expressed  that  there  has  been  "a   change  in  the  culture  towards  refugees  [...]  that  really  paint[s]  them  in  a  way  that  portrays  them   as  people  cheating  the  system  and  taking  advantage  of  the  system"  (Physician,  Male).   (Physician,  Male).  As  a  result,  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  on  the  psychiatric   report  becomes  "almost  proof  of  [the  refugee  claimant's]  suffering"  and  dismisses  the   assumption  that  the  asylum  seeker  is  making  a  fraudulent  claim  (Psychiatrist,  Female).     4.3  Systemic  Barriers      The  majority  of  the  participants  discussed  the  systemic  barriers  that  exist  for  the   refugee  population  in  the  accessibility  and  delivery  of  mental  health  care.     4.3.1  Navigation      The  ability  of  the  refugee  population  to  navigate  the  mental  health  system  was  posited   as  a  barrier.  A  participant  painted  a  picture:  imagine  an  individual  gets  off  of  an  airplane  Â­  they   have  to  find  shelter  and  food,  and  a  social  worker,  welfare  worker  and  a  lawyer  Â­  in  addition  to   obtaining  their  hospital  records  (Psychiatrist,  Female).    In  the  attempt  to  obtain  medical   documents,  it  becomes  difficult  because  they  are  "still  trying  to  navigate  the  system,  so  they  do   not  necessarily  understand  how  the  system  works,  and  its  incredibly  complex,  and  often  very  

  

24  

different  from  their  country  of  origin"  (Physician,  Male).    This  is  further  exasperated  by  the   "shortening  of  the  amount  of  time  people  have  to  prepare  their  hearings,  [...]  with  the  60  day   turn  around  it  is  extremely  fast"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  It  becomes  nearly  impossible  for  refugee   claimants  to  obtain  the  most  appropriate  documentation  for  the  hearing  process.     4.3.2  Health  Care  Insurance        Furthermore,  the  participants  discussed  the  amendments  to  the  Interim  Federal  Health   program  as  a  systemic  barrier  for  the  refugee  population.  The  largest  challenge  stems  from  the   fact  that  although  the  majority  of  the  refugee  population  does  not  understand  the  changes,   most  physicians  do  not  understand  them  as  well  (Physician,  Male).  "The  biggest  challenge  is  the   refugee  system"  (Physician,  Female).  This  is  because  the  service  provider  must  have  a   comprehensive  understanding  of  where  the  refugee  is  "in  the  system,  in  terms  of  health  care   coverage"  (Physician,  Female).  Because  "the  cuts  to  refugee  health  care  are  incredibly   complicated"  there  are  negative  consequences  for  the  refugee  population  in  accessing  health   care  (Physician,  Male).  It  was  expressed  that  "there  are  good  doctors  who  really  want  to   provide  care  who  have  turned  people  away,  just  saying,  `we  do  not  want  to  deal  with  this'"   (Physician,  Male).  Because  "some  refugees  do  not  have  access  to  IFH  funded  programs"   (Psychiatrist,  Female),  "every  time  it  is  always  a  challenge  to  figure  out  what  we  can  get  people   care  for"  (Physician,  Female).     In  response  to  this,  the  participants  were  asked  about  the  repercussions  of  the  City  of   Toronto  becoming  a  Sanctuary  City.  The  majority  of  the  participants  applauded  the  idea  behind   this  implementation;  however,  there  was  a  concern  that  there  are  "so  many  different  levels  of   complexity  to  it"  (Physician,  Female).    Primarily,  it  was  expressed  that  although  Toronto  is  

  

25  

recognized  as  a  Sanctuary  City,  "it  does  not  necessarily  translate  down  to  hospitals  and   clinicians  and  physicians"  (Physicians,  Male).  And  this  is  problematic,  because  in  turn,  "what  we   are  asking  for  is  for  people  to  do  work  pro  bono"  (Physician,  Male).  Consequently,  "for   thousands  of  the  refugees  that  are  uninsured  [...]  a  system  like  this  that  works  on  volunteerism   can  only  do  so  much"  (Physician,  Male).     4.4  Language  Barriers      The  participants  thoroughly  discussed  the  language  barriers  that  exist  for  the  refugee   population  in  the  accessibility  and  delivery  of  mental  health  care.  Although  there  is  a  wealth  of   existing  literature  that  explores  language  barriers,  this  research  project  provides  additional   information  from  the  perspective  of  the  service  provider.     Because,  "you  are  sitting  at  twenty  to  thirty  per  cent  of  people  who  do  not  understand   any  English  at  all"  (Physician,  Male),  the  relationship  between  the  health  care  professional  and   the  refugee  is  severely  hindered.  Consequently,  it  is  often  necessary  for  an  interpretation   service  to  be  utilized.  The  participants  who  work  at  a  federally  funded  institution  explained  that   they  have  access  to  live  interpreters  or  a  telephone  interpretation  system.  However,  the   participants  who  provided  services  in  community-based  health  care  centers  expressed  that  they   experience  a  great  difficulty  in  accessing  interpretation  services  because  of  the  costs  (Physician,   Female).  When  it  is  not  feasible  for  an  interpretation  service  to  be  granted,  the  community- based  centers  operate  "based  off  people  bringing  friends  or  family  members",  a  dynamic  that  is   rendered  "really  improper"  (Physician,  Male).  And,  in  other  circumstances  where  there  ceases   to  be  an  interpreter,  a  friend  or  a  family  member  present,  the  health  care  professional  is  "trying   to  get  a  history  using  only  a  few  words,  which  is  absolutely  inadequate"  (Physician,  Male).    

  

26  

It  was  cautioned  that  although  the  interpreter  supplies  a  communication  bridge   between  the  health  care  professional  and  the  refugee,  this  is  not  a  flawless  exercise.  The  most   frequently  noted  challenge  with  the  utilization  of  interpretation  services  is  that  vital   information  that  is  detrimental  to  an  accurate  mental  health  diagnosis  disappears  with  the   addition  of  a  third  member  to  the  clinical  relationship.  The  appropriately  trained  interpreters   adopt  a  `black  box'  model,  whereby  they  "translate  word  for  word  what  the  person  is  saying"   (Physician,  Female).    And  this  is  problematic  because  "psychiatry  is  just  so  nuanced"  and  "the   pieces  that  tend  to  get  lost"  may  be  the  most  vital  in  the  mental  health  assessment  (Physician,   Female).  Thus,  "if  someone  was  speaking  English  it  would  be  easier  to  tell  if  their  thought  form   was  not  organized  in  some  way",  due  to  their  "fluency  of  speak"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).   However,  this  becomes  hindered  when  a  language  barrier  exists.     4.5  Cultural  Barriers      Throughout  the  interview  process,  all  of  the  participants  were  passionate  during  the   discussion  of  cultural  barriers.  There  was  a  consensus  among  the  participants  that  "cultural   barriers  are  infinite"  and  that  there  lacks  an  awareness  of  the  "extent  [to  which]  we  are   constantly  translating  everything  based  on  our  own  understanding  of  something"  (Psychiatrist,   Female).  And  this  is  important  to  this  context,  because  there  is  "the  mental  health  culture  here   and  the  culture  of  the  individual  refugee"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).     4.5.1  Systemic  Level      At  the  systemic  level,  it  was  expressed  that  the  majority  of  the  refugee  population  has   "no  experience  with  the  mental  health  system  and  in  the  countries  that  they  are  coming  from  

  

27  

the  mental  health  system  may  not  be  very  developed"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  For  example,  one   participant  referenced  Ethiopia,  whereby  "there  is  only  one  psychiatric  hospital"  and  an   individual  only  interacts  with  the  mental  health  system  if  their  "behaviour  is  somehow  out  of   control"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  Consequently,  when  refugees  arrive  in  North  America  "they   have  never  seen  a  psychiatrist"  and  "may  not  really  even  understand  what  we  do"  or  they   identify  the  mental  health  system  as  "just  one  other  hoop  they  have  to  jump  through  in  order   to  work  closer  to  getting  their  refugee  status"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).   4.5.2  Interpersonal  Level      At  the  interpersonal  level,  the  symptoms  that  are  associated  with  mental  illness  in  the   Western  culture  may  not  be  deemed  a  medical  complication  in  other  cultures.  For  example,   one  participant  discussed  a  situation  whereby  a  refugee  had  a  preoccupation  with  ghosts  and   with  witches.    And,  "it  was  not  clear  how  much  of  that  was  cultural  and  how  much  of  that  was   specific  to  their  illness"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  It  was  described  that  this  "would  not  have  been  a   barrier  if  that  person  would  have  been  someone  who  grew  up  in  Canada"  (Psychiatrist,   Female).  As  an  extension  of  this,  there  is  the  emerging  trend  where  "we  tend  to  see  the   medicalization  of  distress",  whereby  there  is  a  sole  focus  on  "the  individual  medical  problem"   (Physician,  Male).  And  there  is  a  strong  pushback  from  a  number  of  refugee  groups  who  plead   that  "these  are  social  problems,  we  need  to  sort  out  the  social  problems  rather  than  the   psychological  problems""(Physician,  Male).  Thus,  it  is  cautioned  that  because  culture  is   embedded  within  mental  health,  "being  aware  of  that  is  really  really  important"  (Physician,   Female).    

  

28  

4.6  Diagnostic  Statistical  Manual        The  majority  of  the  participants  question  the  appropriateness  and  accuracy  of  using  the   DSM  as  a  screening  tool  with  the  refugee  population.  The  first  identified  problem  with  the  DSM   is  why  there  is  a  DSM  (Physician,  Male).  The  American  Psychiatric  Association  introduced  the   DSM  as  a  psychological  screening  tool  because  they  "believed  that  American  should  not  use  the   International  Classification  of  Diseases"  based  on  the  merit  that  the  World  Health  Organization   should  not  "be  able  to  define  who  is  mad  in  America"  (Physician,  Male).  The  participant   identified  this  as  a  fallacy  by  questioning  why  the  American  Psychiatric  Association  would  think,   "the  DSM  would  be  a  good  way  of  thinking  through  people's  expression  of  illness"  (Physician,   Male).  Accordingly,  it  is  argued  "the  DSM  is  likely  to  be  imprecise  unless  we  believe  that   everyone  around  the  world  behaves  the  same  or  reacts  the  same,  which  would  be  a  stupid   thing  to  say"  (Physician,  Male).     In  addition,  the  notion  of  who  created  the  DSM  was  problematized.  "The  DSM  is   basically  expert  opinion,  North  American  mental  health  professionals"  have  decided  on   Western  norms  "what  is  pathologized  and  what  is  not"  (Physician,  Male).     "There  are  problems  with  that  even  when  you  are  talking  about  a  culture   that  is  not  different  from  this  culture.  But  I  think  that  those  problems  are   magnified  or  they  are  exasperated  when  you  are  talking  about  someone   from  a  different  culture  because  we  are  now  potentially  pathologizing   someone's  norm"  (Physician,  Male).     The  behaviours  that  come  to  be  classified  as  a  mental  illness  according  to  the  DSM  are   relevant  to  the  actor  that  has  the  most  influence  at  a  given  time.  Accordingly,  "the  

  

29  

present  has  a  lot  to  do  with  the  [influence  of  the]  pharmaceutical  industry"  (Physician,   Female).  As  more  behaviours  are  classified  as  mental  disorders  and  are  deemed   worthy  of  medical  interventions,  the  "pharmaceutical  industry  obviously  benefits  from   [...]  suggesting  that  something  is  a  clear  diagnosis  that  then  needs  a  clear  treatment"   (Physician,  Female).     As  a  result  of  the  combination  of  these  aspects,  it  was  expressed  that  "ninety-nine  per   cent  of  the  time,  the  DSM  is  not  appropriate"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  There  was  a  consensus   among  the  participants  that  "there  was  a  time  when  we  would  add  up  criteria  and  if  you  did  not   add  up  to  the  total  then  you  were  fine";  however,  it  is  not  used  "as  a  gospel  in  the  same  way"   (Physician,  Male).  And,  as  the  participants  continue  to  interact  with  refugee  populations  who   have  experienced  trauma  they  "discover  that  [they]  have  to  approach  it  differently"   (Psychiatrist,  Female).     4.7  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder      The  participants  discussed  the  positive  and  the  negative  aspects  of  a  diagnosis  of  post- traumatic  stress  disorder.     A  mental  health  diagnosis  for  the  refugee  population  can  be  advantageous.    A  refugee   may  suffer  from  "nightmares,  and  tremendous  anxiety,  avoidant  behaviour,  dissociation,  and   hypervigiliency",  and  applying  a  label  to  these  experiences  "has  been  described  as  incredibly   helpful"  (Physician,  Male).    The  symptoms  that  are  attributed  to  the  refugee  experience   become  contextualized  and  normalized  by  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder   (Physician,  Male).    

  

30  

However,  the  majority  of  the  participants  raise  concerns  about  applying  a  diagnosis  of   post-traumatic  stress  disorder  on  a  refugee.  The  most  frequently  expressed  notion  was  that:   "people  tend  to  get  better  over  time"  (Physician,  Female).  Despite  the  tremendous  amount  of   trauma  that  the  refugee  population  has  been  subjected  to,  "if  you  leave  them  long  enough,   once  they  get  their  feet  on  the  ground,  and  the  dust  settles,  most  people  do  fine"  (Physician,   Male).  And,  because  the  health  care  professionals  are  completing  the  psychiatric  assessment   prior  to  the  refugee  hearing,  they  are  "seeing  somebody  during  the  most  stressful  period  of   their  lives"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  Consequently,  a  participant  cautioned  "over  diagnosing   people  particularly  at  that  phase  in  their  migration  trajectory"  (Physician,  Male).     In  addition,  the  notion  that  "trauma  equals  post-traumatic  stress  disorder"  is  deemed   problematic  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  The  refugee  experience  is  often  characterized  by   catastrophic  events;  however,  because  the  refugee  "might  be  experiencing  reactions  to  an   abnormal  series  of  events  Â­  that  does  not  make  [the  individual]  a  psychiatric  patient"   (Psychiatrist,  Female).  A  participant  rendered  a  question  appropriate:  "Is  a  diagnosis   appropriate  or  is  that  just  being  a  refugee?  (Physician,  Female).     The  participants  also  addressed  the  impact  of  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress   disorder  on  a  refugee,  and  this  was  highly  linked  to  the  notion  of  stigma.  It  was  argued  that   "stigma  tends  to  identify  the  individual  as  the  problem,  [that  although]  this  happens  to  loads  of   different  people,  you  are  the  person  who  has  post-traumatic  stress  disorder"  (Physician,  Male).   In  turn,  "there  is  some  personal  fall  out  with  the  idea  that  in  some  ways  you  have  broken  under   the  stress"  (Physician,  Male).    Because  a  refugee  must  be  a  resilient  individual  to  get  to  the   country  of  asylum,  it  can  be  damaging  to  the  individual  if  the  message  that  they  are  given  is  

  

31  

that  they  are  mentally  ill  (Physician,  Male).  A  participant  revealed  that  although  a  diagnosis  of   post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  documented  on  the  psychiatric  report,  the  label  of  the   diagnosis  is  not  communicated  to  the  refugee,  as  this  could  colour  their  lens,  and  hinder  their   future  steps  in  the  integration  process    (Physician,  Female).     Furthermore,  a  mental  health  diagnosis  according  to  the  merits  of  the  Western   psychiatric  model  is  focused  on  the  individual.  "The  conceptualization  of  the  diagnosis  as  being   an  individual  issue  then  leads  to  us  ignoring  the  structures  that  we  need  in  order  to  help  people   to  succeed"  (Physician,  Male).  A  mental  health  diagnosis,  especially  post-traumatic  stress   disorder,  does  not  take  into  account  the  trauma  of  migration,  and  the  circumstances  that  are   outside  the  scope  of  pre-migration  trauma  (Psychiatrist,  Female).  Alongside  this  notion,  it   ignores  social  supports  and  settlement  services  as  a  solution  to  the  issue  at  hand.  And,  it   questions  the  relevancy  of  the  diagnosis  if  the  refugee  received  assistance  from  the  community   (Psychiatrist,  Female).     4.8  Treatment      The  discussion  regarding  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  the  subsequent  treatment   resulted  in  a  consensus  among  the  participants:  "these  guys  do  not  need  pills"  (Psychiatrist,   Female).  Because  of  the  biomedical  model,  it  is  often  believed  that  pharmaceutical   interventions  are  the  most  appropriate  for  those  individuals  who  manifest  certain  reactions  to   trauma.  However,  "it  depends  on  people's  illness  model  Â­  if  you  believe  that  your  problems   have  been  caused  by  social  factors  [...]  then  there  is  a  certain  resistance  to  taking  medication"   (Physician,  Male).  The  participants  emphasized  the  importance  of  dealing  with  basic  migration  

  

32  

needs,  including  "getting  connected  to  community  support,  making  sure  people  have  food  and   housing  and  access  to  ESL  programs"  (Psychiatrist,  Female).     A  participant  compared  the  refugee  population  with  the  white  collar  population  who   work  on  Bay  Street  in  Toronto:  "if  you  go  to  Bay  Street  you  will  see  a  whole  bunch  of  people   who  are  anxious  and  depressed,  and  none  of  them  will  go  see  a  psychiatrist  Â­  they  will  go  see  a   life  coach"  (Physician,  Male).  A  life  coach  will  direct  them  to  "all  of  the  things  that  you  do  to   balance  your  life"  and  these  "are  the  things  that  people  put  higher  on  the  list  then  taking  pills"   (Physician,  Male).  Similarly  for  the  refugee  population,  it  becomes  more  important  to  learn  how   to  "deal  with  things  at  an  early  stage  of  adjusting  to  a  new  life",  rather  than  being  the  subject  of   a  pharmaceutical  intervention  (Physician,  Female).

5.  Conclusion  and  Discussion        The  findings  of  this  research  project  provide  evidence  that  there  is  a  paradox  between   the  utilization  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  as  a  measurement  of  credibility  in  the  refugee   determination  system  and  the  appropriateness  of  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder   among  the  refugee  population.  This  provides  a  unique  perspective  to  the  existing  literature  on   the  relationship  between  the  refugee  determination  system  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.   Below  is  a  flowchart  that  outlines  the  paradox  that  was  discovered:

5.1  Refugee  Determination  System  and  Refugeeness      At  the  forefront  of  the  discussion,  is  the  relationship  between  the  refugee   determination  system  and  the  social  construction  of  the  refugee.  It  is  apparent  that  the  change   in  culture  towards  refugees,  spearheaded  by  the  Conservative  government,  is  coupled  with  a   `bogus'  discourse,  rather  than  a  humanitarian  tone  that  once  characterized  the  Canadian   immigration  and  refugee  system.  It  is  particularly  evident  that  this  is  surrounding  the  notion  of   `asylum  seekers'  rather  than  the  `Convention  refugee'.  This  dichotomy  is  referred  to  throughout   the  literature,  whereby  the  `good'  refugee  is  one  who  remains  in  refugee  camps  until  they  are   brought  to  Canada  as  government-assisted  or  privately  sponsored  refugees,  and  the  `bad'   refugee  is  one  who  autonomously  arrives  in  Canada  seeking  asylum  of  their  own  volition  (Diop,   2014).  Thus,  it  becomes  the  responsibility  of  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board  to  ensure  that   the  `bad'  refugee  does  not  threaten  the  sovereignty  of  the  state.    The  Immigration  and  Refugee   Board,  according  to  the  merits  of  this  discourse  are  constantly  seeking  to  prove  that  asylum   seekers  who  arrive  in  Canada  are  fraudulent  (Diop,  2014).     Correspondingly,  it  becomes  the  responsibility  of  the  refugee  claimant  to  supply   evidence  that  will  counter  this  discourse.  In  order  to  do  this,  as  outlined  in  Figure  1,  the  refugee   claimant  subjectivity  follows  the  concept  of  refugeeness,  whereby  the  asylum  seeker  becomes   an  object  defined  by  the  law  that  is  constructed  according  to  the  view  of  what  a  `good'  refugee   is  (Lacroix,  2000).    The  refugee  claimant  is  required  to  act  and  look  "like  they  are  helpless,  weak   and  vulnerable"  in  order  to  prove  "their  credibility  as  bonafide  refugees"  (Narula,  2003,  p.10).   "By  obliging  individuals  to  prove  they  are  refugees,  these  exclusionary  practices  push  them   further  into  refugeeness"  (Lacroix,  2000,  p.185).  The  asylum  seeker  must  fulfill  the  

  

35  

characteristics,  which  by  the  merits  of  the  Canadian  refugee  determination  system,  define  who   is  a  `good'  refugee.   5.2  Refugee  Determination  System  and  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder      Although  the  practice  of  proving  one's  credibility  during  the  refugee  determination   process  has  many  dimensions,  the  focus  of  this  research  project  was  on  the  Basis  of  Claim   document,  and  more  specifically  the  psychiatric  report.  This  is  important  because  "it  is  often   not  possible  to  verify  an  account  with  reference  to  other  forms  of  proof"  besides  the   mandatory  information  in  the  Basis  of  Claim  document  (Luker,  2014,  p.6).  It  is  the  psychiatric   report  that  contains  the  evidence  needed  to  fulfill  the  identity  of  refugeeness.  This  is  where  the   relationship  between  the  refugee  determination  system  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder   become  important.  This  is  because  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  particularly   relevant  to  the  refugee  population,  as  it  "becomes  proof  of  [the  refugee  claimant's]  suffering"   (Psychiatrist,  Female).  As  referenced  in  Figure  1,  it  symbolizes  that  the  refugee  claimant  is  a   victim  Â­  that  they  have  experienced  trauma,  and  have  manifested  a  certain  set  of  reactions  as  a   result.  It  dismisses  the  suspicion  that  this  individual  is  a  `bogus'  asylum  seeker,  and  provides   evidence  that  this  refugee  claimant  is  credible,  as  they  fit  within  the  category  of  the  `good'   refugee  according  to  the  merits  of  the  Canadian  refugee  determination  system.     5.3  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  and  Social  Construction      Although  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  was  identified  as  a  necessary   requirement  to  have  on  the  psychiatric  report,  as  outlined  in  Figure  1,  it  is  posited  that  this  is   problematic  because  it  appears  that  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  is  a  social  construction.  

  

36  

Because  it  is  a  social  construction  it  was  called  into  question  whether  post-traumatic  stress   disorder  is  an  appropriate  label  to  place  upon  refugee  claimants  who  have  experienced  trauma.   This  question  was  addressed  by  referencing  the  barriers  that  exist  in  the  accessibility  and   delivery  of  mental  health  care  to  those  who  originate  from  a  non-Western  culture.  These   barriers  demonstrate  that  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  may  only  be  relevant  to  those  whose   lives  are  embedded  within  the  Western  culture.     Because  a  significant  proportion  of  refugee  claimants  are  not  fluent  in  English,  an   interpreter  is  often  required  to  facilitate  the  clinical  discussion  between  the  health  care   professional  and  the  refugee.  Although  the  interpreter  alleviates  the  language  barriers  in   determining  if  a  refugee  claimant's  behaviours  constitute  a  mental  illness,  the  interpreter's   presence  also  adds  a  layer  of  complexity  to  the  interaction.     The  interpreter  may  cease  to  transfer  the  nuances  that  are  connected  to  the  cultural   meaning  of  the  information  being  provided  by  the  refugee.  Subsequently,  the  health  care   professional  may  accept  the  information  at  face  value  and  perceive  it  according  to  North   American  societal  norms.  This  ultimately  silences  the  `patient's'  pre-migration  cultural   background  and  meanings  that  their  respective  culture  gives  to  symptoms  that  are  connected   to  sorrow,  loss  and  grief.  Thus,  language  barriers  are  intimately  connected  to  cultural  barriers.     In  particular,  with  a  focus  on  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  the  Western  psychiatric   model  pathologizes  distress;  and  the  Western  psychiatric  model  is  entrenched  within  the  DSM:   North  American  mental  health  experts  created  it  in  order  to  define  madness  in  America.    The   DSM  dictates  what  is  pathologized  and  what  is  not  pathologized;  or,  what  is  `normal'  and  what   is  `abnormal'  behaviour.  However,  the  symptoms  that  refugee  claimant's  manifest  may  be  

  

37  

culturally  relevant  and  culturally  appropriate  in  accordance  to  their  country  of  origin.    The  social   norms  as  defined  by  the  Western  psychiatric  model  may  differ  significantly  from  the  societal   norms  in  a  non-Western  country.  And  this  becomes  problematic  for  refugee  claimants,  because   in  order  to  be  classified  as  a  refugee,  one  needs  to  have  experienced  some  sort  of  trauma  that   has  resulted  in  them  fleeing  a  specific  location.  The  Western  psychiatric  model  assumes  that   the  experience  of  trauma  renders  the  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  disorder  appropriate.   However,  for  the  refugee  claimant  their  response  to  a  traumatic  event  is  a  normal  reaction  and   a  normal  adaptation  to  the  refugee  experience.  According  to  their  societal  norms,  they  are  not   `patient's';  rather,  they  are  refugees.     5.4  Paradox      The  findings  of  this  research  project  demonstrate  the  existence  of  a  paradox  as  outlined   in  Figure  1:  the  social  construction  of  the  refugee  claimant  and  the  social  construction  of  post- traumatic  stress  disorder.  The  social  construction  of  the  refugee  claimant  deems  that  there  is  a   distinction  between  the  `good'  refugee  and  the  `bad  `refugee.  This  dichotomy  demands  that  the   refugee  claimant  who  is  fleeing  their  country  of  origin  adopts  a  subjectivity  of  refugeeness.  The   `good'  refugee'  is  one  who  is  able  to  manifest  refugeeness  in  accordance  with  the  discourse  of   the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board.  The  ability  of  the  refugee  claimant  to  manifest   refugeeness  is  parallel  to  the  notion  of  credibility.  And,  in  order  to  be  classified  as  a  `good'   refugee  and  be  granted  refugee  status,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  has  emerged  as  a  flagship   of  the  proof  of  suffering  and  victimhood  Â­  symbolizing  refugeeness.  However,  post-traumatic   stress  disorder  is  a  social  construction  Â­  whereby  trauma  is  medicalized  based  upon  the   Western  psychiatric  model.  Thus,  this  research  project  sought  to  add  to  the  existing  literature  

  

38  

by  exploring  the  barriers  of  diagnosing  an  individual  who  originates  in  a  non-Western  culture   with  a  Western  social  construct.  And,  it  sought  to  demonstrate  how  these  barriers  make  it   difficult  to  accept  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  as  an  appropriate  measurement   of  credibility  during  the  refugee  determination  process.       5.5  Limitations  and  Future  Research        This  research  project  has  many  limitations;  given  these  limitations  several  future   research  directions  become  logical  extensions  of  the  study.  First,  the  study  was  a  qualitative   research  design,  and  did  not  include  a  quantitative  component.  It  would  be  insightful  to  include   a  statistical  analysis  of  the  proportion  of  refugee  claimants  who  gain  refugee  status  with  or   without  a  diagnosis  of  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.  In  addition,  although  the  research  project   successfully  identifies  the  barriers  that  exist  in  the  mental  health  system,  it  would  be  interesting   to  include  a  statistical  analysis  on  the  frequency  that  these  barriers  occur  and  the  subsequent   impact  that  the  barriers  have  on  a  mental  health  diagnosis.  Second,  the  sample  size  was   relatively  small  Â­  thus  reducing  the  ability  to  generalize  the  findings.  If  the  study  were  to  be   replicated  it  would  be  interesting  to  expand  the  number  of  participants,  and  the  geographical   boundaries  of  the  study.  The  barriers  in  the  mental  health  system  may  differ  according  to   geographical  location,  particularly  when  comparing  rural  and  urban  spaces.  Third,  because  the   refugee  determination  process  involves  a  multi-faceted  dynamic,  this  research  project  is  limited   to  the  perspective  of  the  health  care  professionals.  A  future  research  direction  may  incorporate   the  perspectives  of  other  interest  groups  such  as  a  lawyer  or  immigration  consultant,  the   members  of  the  Immigration  and  Refugee  Board,  and  the  refugee  claimants.  Fourth,  the   utilization  of  elite  interviews  as  the  research  instrument  presents  difficulties.  Because  the  

  

39  

participants  generally  possess  specialized  information,  it  is  common  for  them  to  have  restricted   availability.  As  such,  not  all  of  the  health  care  professionals  who  agreed  to  participate  in  this   research  project  could  be  interviewed  face-to-face.  However,  the  data  collected  from  the   telephone  interviews  was  unable  to  be  used  in  the  core  data  analysis,  in  order  to  ensure  that   the  standardization  of  the  research  instrument  was  not  compromised.     5.6  Implications      This  research  project  has  implications  for  the  Canadian  refugee  determination  system   and  the  Canadian  settlement  system.     5.6.1  The  Canadian  Refugee  Determination  System      The  findings  of  this  research  project  demonstrate  the  importance  of  recognizing  that   there  is  a  discourse  disseminated  by  the  Conservative  government  that  has  altered  the  way  in   which  Canada  responds  to  asylum  seekers.    And  it  is  this  discourse  that  must  be  challenged   before  any  significant  operational  changes  can  be  made  to  the  Canadian  refugee  system.  The   notion  that  asylum  seekers  are  `bogus'  further  perpetuates  the  rhetoric  that  the  sovereignty  of   Canada  is  under  threat  and  must  be  protected.  The  `bogus'  discourse,  exasperated  by  concerns   about  uncontrolled  migration,  has  encouraged  host  countries,  such  as  Canada,  to  adopt  more   stringent  refugee  determination  procedures.     The  counter-narrative  offered  by  refugee  activists,  such  as  The  Canadian  Association  of   Refugee  Lawyers,  is  particularly  relevant  to  the  implications  of  this  research  project.  In  order  to   dispel  the  myths  regarding  asylum  seekers  the  following  facts  must  be  publicized:  refugee   claimants  are  legally  entitled  to  arrive  in  Canada  without  documentation,  and  this  does  not  

  

40  

classify  them  as  `illegal';  refugee  camps  are  not  the  `regular'  channels  of  refugee  claimants  to   seek  protection;  rejected  refugee  claims  are  not  `bogus';  and,  refugee  claimants  do  not  pose  a   threat  to  the  nation-state  (Canadian  Association  of  Refugee  lawyers,  2014).  A  counter-narrative   will  assist  in  eliminating  the  pervasive  suspicion  regarding  refugee  claimants  in  the  system  of   asylum  adjudication.  In  turn,  rather  than  the  focus  being  solely  on  the  ability  of  the  refugee   claimant  to  prove  credibility  in  accordance  with  the  `bogus'  discourse,  the  refugee   determination  system  can  operate  according  to  the  Conventions  of  which  Canada  is  a  signatory.   These  Conventions  are  built  on  the  premise  of  providing  a  safe  harbor  to  the  world's  most   vulnerable.     5.6.2  The  Settlement  System  in  Canada      The  findings  of  this  research  project  also  have  implications  for  the  settlement  system  in   Canada.  There  was  a  repeated  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  settlement  services  and  how   vital  the  fulfillment  of  migration  needs  is  to  the  successful  integration  of  a  refugee.  The   significance  of  the  psychiatric  assessment  undermines  the  settlement  needs  of  the  refugee.   This  research  project  implies  that  the  Federal  government,  specifically  Citizenship  and   Immigration  Canada,  should  offer  services  to  newcomers  in  their  first  year  of  settlement  in   Canada  (Physician,  Male).  This  is  based  on  the  logic  that  the  government  is  responsible  for  the   Canadian  Military,  the  Royal  Canadian  Mounted  Police,  and  Aboriginal  Peoples  Â­  and  there  are   services  offered  to  these  populations.  However,  in  order  for  Canada  to  provide  settlement   services,  the  Federal  government  needs  to  reallocate  its  funding  Â­  to  all  settlement  sectors   including  language  programs,  affordable  housing,  labour  market  integration,  and  education.  In   doing  so,  the  existing  barriers  in  the  mental  health  system  can  also  be  addressed.  This  is  an  

  

41  

investment  in  the  future  of  Canada  and  of  the  refugee.  Rather  than  allocating  Canada's   resources  to  combating  the  `fraudulent'  asylum  seeker,  the  energy  dedicated  to  the   improvement  of  the  settlement  system  would  be  much  more  beneficial.  However,  as  the   `bogus'  discourse  surrounding  asylum  seekers  continues  to  be  perpetuated  by  the  Conservative   government,  and  Canada  continues  to  sway  from  its  humanitarian  tradition,  our  "nation's   reputation  as  a  beacon  of  hope  for  the  persecuted  will  continue  to  decline"  (Kennedy,  2009,   p.xvii).
