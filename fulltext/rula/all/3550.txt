ABSTRACT Ryerson University does not have a means to gauge electricity consumption for half of their campus buildings. The installation of utility meters is outside of the University's budget, a situation that may be similar across other academic institutions. A multiple linear regression approach to estimating consumption for academic buildings is an ideal tool that balances performance and utility. Using 80 buildings from Ryerson University and the University of Toronto, significant building characteristics were identified (from a selection of 18 variables) that show a strong linear relationship with electricity consumption. Four equations were created to represent the diversity in size of academic buildings. Tested using cross-validation, the coefficient of variation of the RMSE for all models was 33%, with a range of error between 20% and 43%. The models were highly successful at modeling electricity consumption at Ryerson University with an average error of 14.8% for five building clusters. Using metered data from each cluster, raw estimates for individual buildings were adjusted to improve accuracy.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Firstly, I'd like to offer my gratitude to my supervisor, Russell Richman, for presenting this research opportunity to me. In addition, his continued interest and support has been appreciated throughout this journey. I'd like to thank staff members from Ryerson University and the University of Toronto for their efforts and patience in supplying the necessary data for analysis. Specifically, I'd like to thank Tonga Pham, John Fauquier, and Kevin Leong for their attentiveness in addressing my needs and concerns over the past two years. Marcel Schweiker's influence on this project has been greatly understated. I'd like to specifically thank him for introducing and equipping me with the tools required to tackle my research questions. His dedication and insight into research methods pertaining to R were both invaluable and inspiring. To my good friends and fellow classmates Deniz Ergun, Peta-Gaye Ebanks, Amanda Yip, and Joseph Earle: our friendship may have been initiated over our shared anxiety and stress levels about building science, but our relationship only grew because of our continued support for one another (and maybe our weakness to be lured by baby animal videos). Thank you for aiding me in my feeble attempts at a healthy work/life balance. Lastly and most importantly, I'd like to thank my parents for their unwavering confidence in my ability to accomplish my goals. They were, and continue to be my foundation on which I am able to pursue my dreams and passions ­ a position I hope to be for them in the future.

I. INTRODUCTION Between 1990 and 2010, overall electricity consumption for commercial and institutional buildings has increased by 32.5%. While this demand is understandable with an increasing population and a shift to a more service-oriented economy, the greenhouse gas intensity (the amount of GHGs release per unit of energy produced) has only decreased by 5.8% over that same time period [1]. The reductions in air pollutants are thus a result of cleaner fuel sources and not a decrease in energy demand ­ something that needs to be addressed when striving to create sustainable long-term communities. Commercial buildings account for 37% of the Greater Toronto Area's (GTA) total electricity consumption, and one third of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted [2, 3]. Therefore, focusing on the energy consumption in buildings is crucial when trying to reduce overall energy demand. In particular, attention should be given to existing buildings because they comprise 98% of Canada's (commercial) building stock ­ 78% of which have been built before 1989 [4, 5]. The level of impact buildings have on resource consumption is often difficult to quickly assess; the true scale of cities is often overlooked, but with a change of perspective (via aerial/satellite imagery), it is easier to accept how a city such as Toronto required just under 30 tWh in electricity alone in 2006 to power its buildings and homes [6]. While newly constructed buildings receive constant attention from the public for their sustainable and resource efficient designs, adjacent existing buildings are neglected, receiving little to no support for crucial retrofits throughout their lifetime. In Canada, only half of all commercial and institutional buildings have undergone any form of retrofitting in their lifespan [5]. A look at the Canadian Green Building Council's registered and certified LEED projects [7] will show the stark contrast between the number and area of the projects that pursue certification under New Construction (2,669) and those under Existing Buildings (353). The Toronto Green Standards, the City's guideline on sustainable building practices, fails to address the performance of existing buildings completely, opting to focus exclusively on the small fraction of buildings that are added each year to the roughly 3,000 non-residential buildings (nearly 2 million, including private households) already built within the city boundaries [8, 9].

Another reason to focus efforts on the existing building stock is because of their immense potential for reducing carbon emissions. Current efforts to reduce emissions are costly such as harvesting renewable energy and carbon sequestration. Not only are these exercised options expensive, but greater impacts can be made with reducing energy consumption [10]. The majority of the building sector's ability to mitigate emissions in 2030 has been estimated to come at little to no cost to owners, on a dollar per ton of CO2 equivalent basis [11]. Figure 1 shows an underestimated value (omitting the effects from non-technological options, such as demand-side management, on further reduction in emissions) of the mitigation potential for buildings compared to other sectors. A large share of the mitigation potential from the building sector is categorized as a net-negative cost because of the relatively short payback period of many of the explored options (e.g. efficient lighting and appliance upgrades). As illustrated by Ürge-Vorsatz and Novikova [11], allowing existing buildings to merely exist without continuous renewal and upkeep is one of the largest opportunities missed for greater environmental stewardship and return on investment.

Figure 1 Mitigation potential for various sectors and their costs. [11]

Today, buildings in Ontario are constructed with smart meters in place, measuring and reporting consumption data that still needs to be manually read in many existing buildings.

2

This evolution of metering technology has substantially increased the data available, and subsequently, the understanding of usage patterns for electricity and other utilities within buildings ­ short and long term benefits of which are explored by the Energy Efficiency Office [6] and Briones et al. [12]. While Ontario has successfully installed smart meters for measuring electricity usage in most of its residential homes, other parts of the world are struggling with their widespread adoption [13]. Figure 2 shows the current penetration rates of smart meters around the world and their projected growth by 2016 [14]. While there are multiple ways to measure utility consumption for buildings, smart meters provide a reliable and easily assessable means to access current and historic consumption.

Figure 2 Penetration of smart meter technology in international markets. [14]

Reducing the consumption of electricity in buildings can be accomplished by various means. Control can be implemented through cost-demand management strategies where uniform or variable increases in utility costs throughout the day result in their reduced usage by customers. Alternatively, a mandate or legislature can be introduced to incorporate elements of LEED, Toronto Green Standard, or other local or international green standards into enforced provincial building codes ­ the Passive House standard is currently being used in building regulations in Spain, Belgium, and most commonly, in Germany [15]. These are only two of

3

many options that are available to reduce electricity consumption. However, even with these readily available solutions, many buildings across Canada are constructed and operated without implementing such standards. In 2010, 55.2% of all commercial buildings surveyed across Canada had not implemented any energy efficiency features [5]. This proportion slightly decreased around the Great Lakes region (Quebec-Windsor corridor) to 48%. In addition, only 23% of surveyed buildings had an energy awareness program in place for building occupants. Both the perceived level of incentive by building owners and the lack of motivation from building occupants due to inadequate knowledge about energy issues reinforce existing operations and impedes change. Benchmarking buildings, another tool to assess electricity consumption within the city, can tackle both these critical issues. The benefits of benchmarking are twofold: (1) buildings of a certain type within a city can be compared to one another to determine which of them are performing poorly, and (2) buildings of a certain type and/or the whole stock of existing buildings can be compared to other cities to assess the potential for savings - particularly useful when establishing case studies. Benchmarking buildings is an important if not mandatory first step to addressing electricity consumption in the existing building stock. Progress for compiling a comprehensive benchmark for North American cities is in its infancy stages. The United States has been working on benchmarking their existing building stock and publishing these results to further public awareness. At the national level, Energy Star, a joint program between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has been running a tool for several years called the "Portfolio Manager". It allows building operators and owners to monitor and assess their utility usages (electricity and water), create baselines for tracking facility improvements, gain recognition from the EPA and qualify for an Energy Star rating, and most importantly, it allows the (voluntary) sharing of data with other participants. To date, there are more than 40,000 participants with over 250,000 registered buildings in the United States [16]. The success of the platform has led to its adoption in Canada. Natural Resources Canada has been working closely with the EPA since 2011 to adapt its Portfolio Manager for Canadian use. The tool, which was initially released in

4

August 2013, offered benchmarking for office buildings and K-12 schools ­ it has since added hospital type buildings that can be benchmarked with the tool [17]. The Portfolio Manager is not without its faults; there is omission of university and college-type buildings in the current system. A separate program, the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS), which is run by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, focuses on benchmarking university and college buildings in North America. Schools may choose to participate in a lengthier review and rating process under the STARS program or they may opt to report their utility data through the Campus Sustainability Data Collector. Both paths will result in the collection of utility data however only STARS participants will have access to the database. As of September 2014, 358 institutions have participated in the stars program with 35 of them being Canadian. A pilot has been started for 8 international schools to participate in STARS [18]. Tools and rating systems aside, laws and mandates have been enacted in recent years across North America requiring the mandatory disclosure of energy use, making city-wide benchmarks possible. The first two cities in the United States to introduce a disclosure law were Washington, DC and Austin in 2008; between 2009 and 2013, seven other cities joined the ranks of cities mandating energy disclosure. While the practice has yet to be standardized, the scope of buildings benchmarked often include commercial and multi-unit residential buildings that are greater than 1,000 m2, at a minimum, and 23,000 m2 at a maximum ­ depending on the city and building type [19]. In Canada, and specifically in Ontario, all public bodies have been required to report energy consumption for city-owned buildings since 2011 ­ during that year, just under 500 buildings were benchmarked in Toronto, none of which were academic buildings [20]. A brief profile of Toronto and Ryerson University is provided below which will give context to this thesis. Future researchers and users should find this helpful when applying the methods used here to other urban environments and climatic conditions.

A. Toronto Over 80% of Canadians live in cities ­ cities that now consume more than 50% of all energy in Canada [6]. Toronto, Canada's most populous city, has 2.6 million inhabitants and a density of 945.4 people/km2 in 2011 [9]. First established in the late 18th century, Toronto is a relatively young city located in the heavily industrialized Golden Horseshoe region of Southern Ontario. Due to its proximity to Lake Ontario, Toronto's climate is moderated with average daily temperatures peaking in July (22.2°C), dipping in January (-4.2 °C) and averaging 9.2 °C for the entire year; annual precipitation is averaged at 834 mm for the region [21]. Climate normals (1971-2000) for the city can be seen in Appendix A1. Under the Köppen climate classification, the city is categorized as having a warm summer, humid continental climate, and is grouped with other cities such as Warsaw, Stockholm, Vienna, and Moscow [22]. However, unlike those cities mentioned, Toronto has one of the highest per capita electricity consumption of the developed world (Figure 3) at 10,000 kWh/capita in 2011 [23]. The City spent over $4.45 billion dollars on energy alone in 2005 ­ 60.4% of which was allocated to electricity costs [6]. The air emissions associated with generating electricity for commercial and industrial buildings in 2004 can be seen in Table I [24]. These emissions have contributed towards the increased occurrence of smog in the City from under 5 days in 1993 to more than 35 in 2007 [25]. The environmental effects of operating buildings are diverse and can often play a significant role in determining the quality of life in the urban areas they reside. However, because Toronto's building stock is one of the largest in Canada, it also has the greatest potential for energy savings in Canada if measures are implemented correctly.

1) Ryerson University: Ryerson University is a publicly funded university located at the core of downtown Toronto. First established in 1948 as the Ryerson Institute of Technology, the relatively large Canadian university currently houses 38,000 undergraduate students, 2,300 graduate students, 1,700 administrative staff, and 780 faculty members [26]. Its single urban campus covers 8.5 ha and has a total of 30 buildings, providing an enclosed area of 269,384 m2 (building specifications and details can be seen in Appendix A2). As of 2010, the average age of buildings on campus is 38.5, two years below the provincial average for university buildings [27]. In 2013, the university reported 52,383,677 kWh of electricity consumption for the year and emitted 12,847,605 Kg of GHG emissions relating to energy usage [28]. B. Statement of Problem The emergence of building performance benchmarking tools is critical to the understanding and eventual reduction of electricity consumption in our communities. Unfortunately, before academic institutions such as Ryerson University can participate in such programs, an accurate measure for campus building utilities must exist for individual buildings. This missing link is not unique to academic institutions or even to properties in Ontario (Figure 4). The U.S. Energy

7

Information Administration has reported that approximately half of the sampled building respondents (3,600 individual buildings in 2003) could not provide the required energy usage data for the completion of the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) [29]. During a personal interview with Ryerson's Director of Campus Facilities and Sustainability, Tonga Pham, she explained that the installation of new utility meters and energy management systems place a heavy financial burden on building owners; with limited financial resources, many properties forgo this necessary service.

Figure 5 Historic electricity consumption for individually-metered, cluster-metered, and all buildings at Ryerson University.

Ryerson University currently does not have insight into the electricity consumption of its buildings on an individual basis. With increasing energy consumption (Figure 5) and associated costs for these utilities across Canada, greater focus on energy efficiency on campus is needed. When considering the effects of the addition and removal of buildings on campus since 1990, the trends differ to those shown in Figure 5; individual buildings use the same amount of electricity per unit area while buildings metering in a cluster and all Ryerson buildings see an increase of 17% and 8% respectively. Of the 32 buildings or spaces on campus, 14 share a meter with two or more buildings or spaces (i.e. energy consumption for these buildings is

Figure 6 Ryerson University campus map. Highlighted buildings are those sharing an electricity meter with one or more buildings. Adapted from [31]

unknown on an individual level) which are highlighted on a campus map in Figure 6. According to Shiv Tangri, supervisor of Utility Management at Ryerson, where a more detailed level of reporting is required, a weak, unscientifically based estimation is made using an undisclosed method by Ryerson University. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a similar scenario is present where the number of utility meters is less than the number of buildings on campus. However, McCusker [32] was able to benchmark 84% of the total built area using available data in order to gauge energy performance for the university. In contrast, Ryerson's access to individual meters on campus represents 50% of the total built area ­ responsible for 41% of all electricity consumed on campus in 2012 (Figure 7). In order to provide the University with detailed and accurate data on the energy performance of its buildings, few options exist. The installation of energy meters for Ryerson buildings carry high upfront costs (i.e. 2 million dollars) and is outside the budget of the University at present, as communicated by Tonga Pham. A budget for installing meters campus-wide compiled by staff at the university can be seen in Appendix A3. Another option, building traditional energy models, is time consuming

10

and costly for complex buildings which again, may not be an optimal solution for the University. A form of energy estimation based off of characteristic building variables is a viable option to gauge energy performance for Ryerson's campus buildings and should be fully explored.

Objectives This thesis aims to establish a methodology for creating a series of equations used to estimate electricity consumption in academic buildings, based on variables relating to space usage and built form. The reason why electricity is the focus of this thesis is because it comprises the largest share of total energy consumption at the university (58% in 2012), and because it is the only sub-metered utility on campus that can provide the data necessary for the proposed methodology. These equations will address two prohibitive characteristics of other existing options: high costs and detailed knowledge of building science theory. The costs associated with implementing energy saving building features have long been a major hurdle to overcome in the construction industry. Those who do not wish to undertake such an expensive project often consider tools such as building energy models to assess their current and possible future consumption patterns in order to establish a case for action. However, when financial resources are limited, and future return on investment is obscure, the risks may be too great for building owners/managers of existing buildings to take. Closely related to costs is the issue of lack of knowledge. Energy modeling programs and building science knowledge is specific and takes years of experience to be able to make confident, informed decisions. This can intimidate decision makers, forcing them to back away from energy-saving retrofits. For owners who have access to larger budgets, this issue is remedied by hiring skilled professionals, however many cannot afford this luxury. While the use of an equation to gauge electricity consumption has the potential to minimize costs and be easy to understand, it must also be reliable and accurate. A delicate balance must be achieved between accessibility and accuracy to maximize the benefits to the user. 1) Research Questions: Using a database comprising of campus buildings from the University of Toronto and Ryerson University, annual electricity consumption will be correlated with selected variables to form a multiple linear regression that will accurately model consumption in large, multiuse buildings. In doing so, this work intends to address the following primary research question:

13

1. To what degree of accuracy, can the use of predictor variables be in estimating electricity consumption for academic buildings? In doing this, the following secondary research questions will also be answered: 1. Does this approach offer a realistic alternative to installing meters for individual buildings for Ryerson University; what are the tradeoffs in cost and accuracy between the proposed method and existing alternatives? 2. Are there certain building typologies that work better or worse with this method? Do they pose real limitations when implemented? D. Long-Term Goal & Vision The full scope of this research program is large and is intended to be completed over several years. First and foremost, the end goal of this project will be to provide a tool for Ryerson Campus Facilities and Sustainability that will allow them to assess their current electricity consumption based on the variables required by the equation. Upfront cost savings aside, the results of this research will greatly increase the effectiveness of efforts made by Campus Facilities and Sustainability to reduce electricity consumption on campus. With greater insight into the specific electricity consumption for individual buildings, a benchmark can be created among campus spaces that can help identify underperforming buildings. Resources can then be diverted to those specific spaces/buildings in order to maximize the return on investment for campus sustainability initiatives as well as ensure all buildings meet the minimum performance levels. From there, a comprehensive energy sustainability plan can be created for the university, creating a strategic framework that will guide short and long-term development plans on campus, considering budgetary constraints and high priority issues. E. Thesis Structure The sections following the Introduction of this thesis include the Literature Review, Methodology, Model Development, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. The Literature Review will introduce research relating to energy consumption in higher education institutions as well as outline existing work on methods of energy estimation. The section will conclude with a 14

summary of commonly cited variables used when estimating electricity consumption and a critical analysis of existing literature. The Methodology will summarize the steps taken to establish working models while the Model Development section will discuss the chosen variables for analysis at length including reasons for their selection, sources and quality of data, and preparation of data for regression analysis. In addition to revealing the final building sample and their collected variables, the tools used to carry out the analysis and create equations will also be outlined. The Results section will focus on the top candidate models and their performance as tools to estimate electricity consumption. The effects of variations in the methodology are also shown and the process of arriving at the final models for application is explained. Lastly, the estimated electricity consumption for Ryerson's cluster-metered buildings is presented with a comparison to their metered cluster values. The discussion will explore model performance in greater detail with a comparison to Rahman's [33] simulated results for Ryerson buildings. A closer examination of the model variables as well as buildings excluded from the study will also be included. The Discussion will end with a focus on challenges, both ones experienced throughout the study and those that will face future researchers adopting similar methods. The thesis will be concluded by revisiting the goals and research questions of this project, and the performance of the detailed method. The direction of future work will also be touched upon in the closing sections. Before proceeding any further, it is important to note that the terms "energy" and "electricity" are used interchangeably throughout this thesis. As this work is dealing exclusively with electricity, it should be assumed that references made to energy are synonymous to electricity ­ unless otherwise stated. This treatment of terms also extends to ratios where energy and electricity use intensities are used to refer to the same metric ­ the amount of normalized electricity consumed.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW Research involving academic buildings, particularly post-secondary institutions, and their utility consumption patterns is limited throughout existing literature because they comprise a smaller proportion (compared to commercial and residential) of newly constructed and existing buildings. In addition, their complexity in space usage, occupant density, and plug loads from one building to another, make generalizing consumption into standard energy use intensity units difficult. Caeiro et al. [34] outlines various other factors that are unique to academic buildings which make estimation difficult. There are limited resources available specifically for university and college buildings; knowledge is often extracted from works on other building types (e.g. analyzing multi-use residential buildings to make deductions about dormitories). Potentially due to a lack of experience and knowledge in sustainability on campuses, many academic institutions have come together through a number of regional and national initiatives targeting issues of sustainability, including energy use and efficiency. Examples of such initiatives are the Higher Education Environmental Performance Improvement (HEEPI) and EcoCampus in the United Kingdom, the Canadian Alliance of College and University Sustainability Professionals (CUSP) in Canada, and the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) in North America. Innovative projects and data collection from university and college buildings has risen as a result of groups such as these, however peer-reviewed research articles on the subject is still limited. Existing literature on energy consumption in buildings (including academic) can be grouped into one of three levels of research: assessment, benchmarking, and change. Ideally, each level should be built on top of one another, meaning for instance, that benchmarking should not occur for a building before assessment takes place (Figure 8). Researchers often either focus on one level of research (e.g. compiling a comprehensive national benchmarking system for grocery stores [35]), or they tackle more than one level in a project (e.g. measuring and benchmarking energy consumption in a grocery store and installing a more efficient HVAC system to lower the consumption below the national average [36]). Literature falling within the first two levels will be presented here because it relates most closely to the scope of this thesis. 16

A. Electricity Consumption within Academic Buildings This section will discuss electricity consumption in buildings that are found on university and college campuses. Much of the literature available and presented in this section focuses specifically on electricity, however, because energy consumption in all its forms is often studied cooperatively, research on other sources of fuel is also included. In addition, the works highlighted here focus mainly on studies completed on campus buildings ­ as opposed to inferring results from more commonly studied building typologies such as offices and multi-unit residential buildings. This will show the actual level of knowledge (or lack thereof) on energy consumption for higher education buildings without being distorted by works on space types that are similar to those found in universities and colleges. This distinction is important because existing literature has yet to prove whether this type of inference is accurate. 1) Normalization (Electricity Use Intensities): When measuring and benchmarking electricity consumption between buildings, the units that are most insightful are those that are attached to a key determinant of energy use. When overall consumption in kilowatt-hours is compared between two buildings, very little information is gained about the performance of the building ­ even when comparisons are made between similarly classified buildings (e.g. single detached houses, libraries, etc.). Instead, by linking consumption to a variable such as conditioned floor area, consumption can be normalized and compared on equal footing [29]. The most common 17

EUI metric that is used for buildings in general is floor area due to its simplicity and effectiveness in allowing comparisons to be made [37]. This is especially true when considering other forms of fuel, such as natural gas, due to its positive correlation with conditioned area; some studies have taken this further and have incorporated interior volume as the reporting metric [38]. Aside from variations on floor area, other metrics have been used consistently in existing literature; a common theme is focusing on the particular services offered by the building or space. For instance, occupants, such as students or staff, have been related to energy consumption in academic buildings, and the number of dishes prepared, used for kitchen spaces [30]. Ward et al. [39] studied 103 universities and 91 colleges to determine correlations with total energy consumption and certain indices (e.g. number of full time students, net internal area, age of buildings, etc.). It was found that the factors with the strongest correlations with energy consumption were gross interior floor area (r2=0.86), net interior floor area (r2=0.83), and number of full time research students (r2=0.83). Climate is also an important metric used to normalize energy consumption as it defines the exterior conditions that a building's active systems must respond to. Normalizing to climate is especially important when comparisons are made between buildings in different climate zones. Because the models pursued in this thesis are customized for the Toronto-market, this type of normalization is insignificant (ie. the models will be created and tested on buildings within the city of Toronto). Instead, the quasi-standard electricity consumption unit, kwh/m2/annum, will be used throughout this section so that comparisons between published results can be made. Table II represents a summary of literature on EUIs for education-related spaces. Each entry specifies when the data was collected (or when the study was published), the location of the sampled buildings, the space classification that is linked to the measurement, and the size of the sample. Studies that measured total energy consumption and/or source/primary energy were omitted from Table II in order to promote uniformity and ease of assessment. Breaking down the table by geographic scope, buildings in North America use more electricity per unit area than those in Europe. A quick non-weighted average of the EUIs for academic-related spaces is approximately 210 kWh/m2/annum for North America and 120 kWh/m2/annum for

18

Europe. Adding office buildings (due to a lack of data for academic buildings) located in Asia, Figure 9 shows the ratios typical for each continent. The stark differences can be heavily attributed to the prevalence of air conditioning in buildings; in Europe, natural ventilation and high ceilings are common in older campus buildings while in Asia, hot and humid conditions require active cooling for occupant comfort. Baker and Steemers [40] points out that air conditioning can potentially account for 44% of energy demand in office buildings in the UK. The EUI reported for Asian countries may be inflated due to the sample comprising of multitenant office buildings in Lam et al.'s [41] study which are normally conditioned within a narrower margin than academic buildings. Geographic scope aside, Table II shows the variability that exists in the measurements for electricity use in academic buildings. Studies on buildings within the same continent vary considerably as well as within similar space classifications. Consequently, transferability of small sampled results is difficult between institutions.

Benchmarking energy consumption for buildings is a powerful tool that not only gives an indication of current performance, but also informs researchers of historic and future trends in the sector. Databases allow for the assimilation and organization of potentially very large data sets, which is necessary when creating a reliable benchmark. Due to the resources required to track the number of buildings that exist, many of these databases are created and maintained by the government. These databases were first created for high impact building types such as industrial or residential buildings; these type of buildings have a proportionately large energy footprint in the building sector either due to their sheer numbers, in the case of residential, or their energy requirements for operation, in the case of industrial [57, 58]. Currently, the Energy

23

Use Data Handbook [1] is updated annually by the Government of Canada and provides consumption information on major energy consuming sectors in Canada. While these types of reports give insight on overall trends in terms of supply and demand of energy across the country, they lack the detail provided by [5, 29], documenting building characteristics and usage patterns alongside their energy demands. These programs are active but are less frequently updated and survey a sample of the entire building stock of that country. An example of such a program is the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), which covers buildings in the United States. CBECS was first conducted in 1979 and has historically been updated every three years; the most recent survey published was from data collected in 2003 and work is underway for its ninth iteration using 2013 survey data. To summarize, the Survey of Commercial and Institutional Energy Use [5] and CBECS [29] yields more insightful data on buildings and energy consumption but lacks the geographic breadth and inclusiveness of [1]. Both types of report provide valuable information on energy consumption within buildings, and their level of impact on a provincial and/or national scale. Certain pilot projects offer the benefits of both types of studies such as the Benchmarking Guide for School Facility Managers [59] however they are rare and are often not updated after the original publication. The benchmarking of schools in [59] is insightful and encompasses buildings across Canada however the focus of the study is on primary and secondary schools. Nevertheless, federal reports such as these are instrumental in conducting research in this field by supplying quality datasets to use and/or to improve upon. There are a few papers that are especially relevant to understanding and estimating electricity consumption in academic spaces. While some of their findings are summarized in Table II, the remainder of this section will be dedicated to detailing the context, methodology and findings of such selected works. The objectives of Bonnet et al. [30] are very similar to those of this thesis in which they: (1) attempted to establish a methodology for auditing energy consumption in university buildings, (2) tested the methodology on real buildings at the University of Bordeaux, (3) gathered data about energy consumption to compile a database specifically tuned to university buildings, and (4) increased their understanding of the patterns

24

and fluctuations in university buildings. Electricity use intensities for area and occupancy were calculated for campus buildings and were categorized by primary activity such as research, catering, and lecturing spaces. They found that libraries showed the smallest EUI of all spaces (25 kWh/m2/annum), while (high tech) laboratories showed the greatest (123 kWh/m2/annum). Subcategories were created for catering and research areas due to large variations in consumption making generalization difficult. Within catering, spaces were differentiated by the proportion of cooking space required to serve the area. Restaurants, for instance, required a larger kitchen area than cafeterias and as such, use more electricity overall per unit area. Furthermore, electricity was better correlated with the number of meals served in the space, however, the authors acknowledged the difficulties in accounting for this unit. Laboratory spaces were divided between high and low technology spaces based on their reliance on powered equipment. Unfortunately, even with the subgroups created, large variations persisted in labs and correlation with area was weak; the reported mean EUI of 117 kWh/m2/annum for research areas was not statistically significant. The EUIs for all activity types were aggregated for all buildings and applied to the space usage breakdown for the University to determine what types of areas consumed the most and least electricity. The breakdown by area and total energy consumption of university spaces studied in their paper can be seen in Figure 10. The change in proportion between area and end-use is significant for catering, lecturing, and research and development spaces. Particular attention should be put on these spaces as they may be a key determinant for estimating electricity consumption for Ryerson buildings.

Another example of linking electricity consumption with a particular space type is outlined in [56] where estimation is based on average electricity benchmarks from United Kingdom higher education institutions. The breakdown of space types for the higher education sector can be seen in Figure 11 and is comparable to those found at the University of Bordeaux. The guide covers the assessment of electricity consumption as the first of a three-step process to benchmark and meet specific energy targets. Therefore, there are no published results within the guide nor are there any performance metrics for the assessment. Nevertheless, the concepts behind this method of relating consumption with specific activity spaces are very similar to the ones employed in this thesis and other published work.

The challenges of generalizing electricity consumption for academic buildings is made evident with Elliott and Guggemos' [55] work on auditing energy use in high school buildings. The study attempted to identify the cause of variation in consumption between two seemingly similar high school buildings. One building held a LEED-Silver/Energy Star designation while the other did not ­ both had similar occupant sizes and overall construction. Through their audit and analysis, it was revealed that a combination of different plug loads and space usages was the root cause of the consumption difference. Specifically, the LEED-rated school had a higher density of computers in their comparatively smaller computer lab which offset the energy savings from using low wattage lighting throughout their building. Significant differences in EUI that were found between spaces in both schools included: computer labs (2.1x), trades classrooms (2.1x) gymnasiums (1.7x), kitchens (1.6x), and common areas (1.5x). While this variability is not unexpected with these space types, they remain a significant usage type in academic buildings, particularly in colleges and universities. Figure 12 shows the proportion of space usage and electricity consumption for the combined high schools. Similar to the University of Bordeaux, spaces which rely heavily on electrical equipment (e.g. kitchens, administrative, etc.) see an increase in share from area to electricity use. Interestingly however, computer labs in the high schools only see a modest increase in footprint from area to overall energy consumption. Elliott and Guggemos conclude by stating the weaknesses of whole 27

building EUIs for multiuse buildings and recommends instead workspace and component EUIs for benchmarking and highlighting inefficiencies. While relating space usage types with certain energy profiles is one of the simplest approaches to generalizing electricity consumption, this study shows the effects of ignoring plug loads. However, [55] only compares and contrasts the energy profile between two buildings ­ it is expected that with a greater sample size, the differences will be diminished.

B. Methods of Estimating Electricity Consumption in Buildings As mentioned in the Problem Statement of the Introduction, the only solution available for quantifying the electricity consumption at Ryerson University, and potentially other institutions, is some form of model-based estimation. Aside from creating energy models for all clustermetered buildings, there are many tools that can assist in forming a reliable estimate. Chung [37] details and compares several different mathematical models used to quantify building energy use. Zhao and Magoulès [60] covers a broader scope and includes several frontier prediction methods such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines. This Section will outline common methodologies used to estimate electricity or total energy consumption for all types of buildings. 28

Common to all methods, estimating energy consumption for a building relies on interpreting a series of variables. The complexity of the model is related to how many of these variables are considered, whether the correlation between energy consumption and the variables are linear or non-linear, and the inclusion or exclusion of interaction effects between variables. On one end of the spectrum, energy models are all-inclusive, allowing an entry to be made for all building variables that affect energy consumption; on the other end, simple normalization only accounts for one key determinant, such as area, to predict energy use. In-between the two, there are a host of alternatives that vary in the amount of variables considered, when forming an estimate. Successes have been found across the board making performance-based rankings difficult, but their approach and ease of use can be clearly defined [61]. Simulating energy use through computer models has been used extensively in the design/planning, maintenance/operation, and optimization/retrofit stages of the building lifecycle. This is due to its ability to predict detailed energy use from a flexible number of inputs for a particular building ­ a simple task for trained individuals. However, the main drawbacks to building and using energy models for prediction purposes is that the quality of inputs into the model are directly related to the outputs. If accurate physical measurements are not entered for the building, detailed characteristics are not attributed to building spaces, and materials and envelope assemblies are left unspecified, there is a high probability that the model will not be representative of the building. This is particularly troublesome for beginners as the use of default values is often detrimental to the model's accuracy. There are nearly 150 programs specific to energy modeling that are listed in the Building Energy Software Tools Directory compiled by the U.S. Department of Energy [62]. This level of diversity increases the difficulty for untrained professionals to seek and learn the proper tools they require; this partly explains why sourcing this work is often expensive and time consuming, especially for multiuse buildings [63]. While detailed models have a dedicated market, work on simplified models requiring much fewer user inputs has been published. These models, which focus on energy use stemming from the HVAC system rely on fewer and less complex inputs (i.e. weather and climate-related variables), and is detailed in Al-Homoud's [64] paper. Energy models have also

29

been used in conjunction with statistical methods to narrow down variables of interest. Modeling programs provide a simple way of conducting sensitivity analysis on building variables by changing values between defined extremes to gauge the effects on energy consumption, which was employed in [65-68]. Depending on the perceived or known relationship between the independent variable and energy consumption, two values are simulated for a linear relationship and three or more values are simulated for nonlinear relationships. Once significant variables have been identified for a particular building or typology, they are analyzed and used in statistical models. This feature, however, is not exclusive to simulation programs as demonstrated by Hong et al. [38] where a sensitivity analysis for variables affecting electricity consumption and heat loss took place using artificial neural networks ­ the results of which can be seen in Figure 13. Energy modeling can also create large virtual sample sizes for training and/or testing other estimation methods that would not be possible with the current level of building surveys available. While there are certain inherent risks with using a virtual dataset to train/test a model, this option is invaluable for establishing early performance benchmarks.

Methodologies for estimating energy consumption have more recently stemmed from disciplines outside of statistics including pattern recognition (decision tree), and machine learning (artificial neural networks). In recent years, these methods have been tasked with estimating energy consumption for a variety of buildings. Decision trees are a way of categorizing data into groups in a visual manner. The method behind building or growing a decision tree is to find features or variables that can group individuals together to form subsets of the original sample. The node at the top of the tree, the root, represents the entire sample size; in a series of splitting actions (working down the tree), individuals are separated and categorized based on defining characteristics until all observations contained within a node are within an acceptable range of values, thus becoming a leaf of the tree [70]. Figure 14 is a general schematic of how decision trees are visually represented. Red lines represent buildings that don't meet the criteria and green lines represent the subset that do. Numbers contained within the brackets indicate buildings classified in each node and are used to calculate the average EUI for that leaf node. Depending on the application, decision trees can predict discrete (classification tree) or continuous (regression tree) values [71]. Within the context of buildings and energy consumption, EUIs would be classified based on significant variables such as glazing ratio and number of occupants. Important to note is that variables selected as significant are those that differentiate observations from one another and not on their correlation with energy consumption. For instance, if the entire building sample has a glazing ratio of 50%, it would not be a node on the tree because of its inability to split the sample despite its proven relationship with energy use. The greatest strengths with using decision trees are their ability to accurately categorize data without understanding the underlying relationships between dependent and independent variables. Also, their ability to provide a visual aid and/or logic statements that govern a particular sample increase their capabilities in communicating potentially complex relationships to the general public [72]. The effectiveness of using decision trees to estimate energy consumption is demonstrated in Yu et al. [72] who looked at predicting the EUI of residential buildings using ten inputs. The model was developed using a sample of 55 buildings and tested on 12 randomly selected buildings. The decision tree was able to correctly classify all but one of the buildings into their appropriate 31

categories. However, the error rate between the reference and actual EUI for the buildings was apparent (average error = 25.6%). This means that despite the 91.7% accuracy of the decision tree in categorizing buildings, the variations in electricity consumption within each leaf node was considerable, taking away from the overall reliability of the method. A larger sample size would potentially address this shortcoming but further research is needed to consider this observation a major drawback. Decision trees also suffer when non-linear relationships exist between variables and when the tree is over fitted to the data it was built upon ­ a common issue with this method [73]. Despite these drawbacks, decision trees offer a realistic solution for estimating energy consumption for people with a lack of building knowledge [61].

From a transparency standpoint, artificial neural networks (ANNs) operate in complete contrast to decision trees. They were originally modeled after the biological structure and properties of the central nervous system (i.e. brain) found in animals ­ hence being classified under machine learning. Today, they can be found in the backend processes powering speech and facial recognition in modern day electronics, among other things [61, 74]. ANNs are composed of a series of interconnected nodes (neurons) that are arranged in a series of layers. In its most basic form, ANNs have an input, hidden, and output layer (Figure 15). The input layer represents the body's five senses and is responsible for feeding all available data (simultaneously) to the brain, the hidden layer. The hidden layer contains a series of nodes with adaptive weights. During the

32

learning phase, these connections and weights are adjusted to provide some defined optimal solution. In addition, the number of hidden layers can be increased to account for greater complexity among variables. The output of the ANN, an action or thought in animals, would be some measurement of energy consumption for research in this field. ANNs' strengths come from their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships between variables ­ an issue facing competing methods [61]. However, this strength comes at a costly price. Within a controlled environment, it is much easier to predict how a person will react to stimuli than it is to understand the motives behind their actions. They themselves may not be acutely aware of why they are doing something (e.g. natural instinct). This analogy explains why ANNs (along with support vector machines) belong to a group aptly named by the engineering community as "black box methods", for their inherent obscurity in variable weights [61, 75]. While this makes model building difficult to comprehend for beginners, users enjoy the benefits of being able to model complex and nonlinear relationships with simple inputs and outputs. The most commonly used model is a multilayer perception, a type of supervised network. This means that the model learns only when data on the expected outcome is available. Training occurs through a technique known as backpropogation in which the inputs are repeatedly entered into the model and the error (the difference between the output computed and the expected output) is then used to adjust the weights within the hidden layer to improve the accuracy. This is repeated until the model or network achieves an acceptable level of accuracy [74]. Performance-wise, ANNs are highly competitive when applied to buildings and energy consumption. Aside from comparative studies by Tso and Yau [61] and Hawkins et al. [76], the effectiveness of ANNs can be seen in Yalcintas and Ozturk's [77] work where a network was developed to model buildings using the 1999 CBECS database. Using eight input variables, the model outperformed multiple linear regressions created and tested using the same sample. In addition, the authors commented on the flexibility of the network, which could be applied to different climate zones after a period of training with the regional data ­ a feature not shared by the more structured multiple linear regression approach. Among primary and secondary schools Hawkins et al. [76] and Hong et al. [78] created neural networks that could predict electricity consumption within a 34% and 20.6% margin of error, respectively. ANNs have and 33

will continue to play a role in quantifying energy consumption in a wide variety of buildings. Their ability to model complex relationships between variables continues to attract researchers in this field.

1) Multiple Regression Analysis: Statistical regression models rely on identifying one or more variables that correlate well with energy consumption and are responsible for a significant portion of the overall building consumption. These variables are best identified by using historic data from buildings; alternatively, they can be identified by running sensitivity analysis via energy models (computer-based or other), as previously discussed. Regression models are similar to computer-based energy models in terms of how they process inputs and calculate energy consumption however there are no interactions between multiple equations as may be the case when running simulations. Statistical models exist to explain variations of a dependent variable with as few explanatory factors as possible. Regression models are capable of representing linear or non-linear relationships between variables, however, with building energy consumption, existing literature has heavily favored linear regression models for their simplicity and acceptable performance levels. Lam et al. [67] looked at correlating 28 parameters with energy consumption from 387 simulated buildings and found that eight of them fit better with a quadratic regression than a linear one; six of those parameters were related to the HVAC system of the building.

34

One of the earliest attempts at using multiple regression, a model comprising of more than one independent variable, to estimate energy consumption in buildings was Boonyatikarn [79] in 1982. His doctorate thesis explored the prediction of energy consumption in 50 institutional buildings in Michigan using building-related variables. His final model, which was successful in accounting for 93% of the variation observed in energy consumption, included the following ten variables: exhaust air rate, hours of HVAC operation, opaque wall area, type of refrigeration, percent of floor area air conditioned and cooling degree day, type of air handling unit, type of fuel used, volumetric flow rate divided by the power of the supply fan, shading in winter, and shading in summer. Over 30 years later, using statistical models has become one of the most commonly used methods of estimating energy consumption. Of the 23 papers surveyed by Chung [37], 12 papers used the ordinal least square (i.e. linear regression) method to estimate consumption, and four papers used other statistics-based methods; the remaining seven papers used various computer simulated models. Other early works employing multiple regression analysis include models on energy use on a military base [80], restaurant [81], recreation center [82], and residential buildings. Works by these authors are summarized in [63] which captures the level of knowledge and available tools for researchers tackling similar research problems as this thesis, more than two decades ago. Developing a regression model is an iterative process that requires a thorough understanding of statistics. Fortunately, there are tools available to simplify the process by creating preliminary models that can be further developed. The most popular statistics software (SPSS, MATLAB, SAS, R, etc.) are all capable of running multiple regression analysis which is available through an add-on, if not offered as a core feature. These programs have the ability to automate the model and feature selection based on a variety of user-defined options. Relying heavily on an automated process to develop working models is often criticized as a thoughtless approach [83]. Thus it is important to use a priori knowledge of the relationships between dependent and independent variables to inform decisions on which correlations are meaningful [84]. Selected parameters can potentially require very specific and technical

35

building information such as thermal performance of assemblies and shading coefficients, however, it is not a prerequisite for a well performing model, as is further discussed below. Examples of more recent studies using regression models to estimate energy consumption can be referenced in Table III (with further details shown in Appendix B2) as the majority of sourced studies are based on regression analysis. Further detail on this technique is discussed in the Model Development section including how collinearity among predictor variables, one of the main weaknesses of regressions analysis, is addressed. C. Predictor Variables for Energy Consumption Variables used to estimate electricity consumption in buildings are highly diverse, even among similar methods. Table III shows past literature on modeling electricity consumption in various types of buildings using one of the methods previously detailed (i.e. ANNs, decision tree, multiple linear regression). The Table includes the total number of variables, which averages seven for the included studies, and the number of variables in their models falling under the defined categories. Much more detail about the studies and their methods including their error rate, sample size, and target buildings can be seen in Appendix B2. Also referenced in the Appendix are the specific variables that defined each category such as outdoor air temperature and hours of rain for the site-specific/location category. There is a wide spread of variables selected for modeling especially when there are no preceding studies to build upon. Sensitivity analysis on model variables such as those in Figure 13 provides useful insight into their effectiveness as predictors but few studies take this extra step. Table III should be used to demonstrate this diversity with less emphasis placed on the frequency of certain categories being chosen. This is because Table III represents a small snapshot of reality and includes certain biases such as including multiple works from the same author(s) ­ leading to some variables being overrepresented. Given that there are no obvious trends or guidelines evident through the review of existing literature, variable selection will rest solely on the original guidelines previously established: that variables to be considered should have a proven impact on electricity consumption (i.e. high sensitivity) and that they require minimal effort to gather the necessary data for model creation and application. 36

D. Critical Assessment of Current State of Research Research papers presented and summarized in this section have shown varying levels of successes at quantifying and benchmarking energy consumption in buildings. However, these studies are often isolated from one another and lack a collaborative approach at tackling the main research questions. In addition, questionable practices, such as those listed below, should be corrected or addressed with urgency to promote cohesion and confidence among researchers and interested parties. This section will conclude with an assessment of weaknesses found in existing work and the foreseeable challenges facing future progress. 1) Weaknesses of Existing Literature: Sensitivity Analysis Based on Uncalibrated Building Models: A large proportion of work in understanding the sensitivity of certain variables on

37

electricity consumption depends on constructing and executing energy simulations. The issue with relying on simulations is that their outputs may not be validated. Unlike cases where energy models are built using real buildings, calibrated using their utility bills, and applied to predict future consumption, the behavior of a base case model, used to test different variables, remains unchanged from one model to another. This would be akin to relying on outputs from an uncalibrated energy model. Similar to the process of calibrating an energy model, a base case model used for sensitivity analysis needs to be calibrated using actual building data to justify the outputs from using this method. Until such practices have taken place, results from exploring the effects of building variables using energy models cannot be entirely relied upon ­ their direction of effect (positive or negative) and their relative proportions to other variables may hold true, but their absolute effect on electricity use intensity may be inaccurate. Shortage of Quantitative Studies on Energy Consumption and Building Variables: A focus on qualitative effects of building variables on energy use is abundant in literature but ones quantifying them are limited. This may be due to several reasons, all of which relate to the complexity and technicality of quantifying the relationship between specific building variables and electricity use. Without a discrete relationship, it is difficult to justify the need to prioritize certain variables over others. Lack of Standardization: Energy use intensity, or more specifically "energy", can represent multiple measures and has yet to be standardized in current literature. EUI can refer to total building energy consumption, which includes all forms of energy supplied to the building (i.e. electricity, natural gas, and steam), or it can represent a singular form. Another dimension to consider is whether the consumption values represent site energy or primary energy ­ which takes into account energy lost during the generation and transmission of energy to the building. Electricity is particularly susceptible to transmission losses resulting in a larger difference between the measured site and primary energy value [92]. Most authors are aware that energy is a loose and generic term which needs defining however not all authors are clear in their attempts to distinguish the differences in the prefaces of their own work.

38

Compared to other indices (e.g. floor area, occupants, etc.), normalizing EUIs based on space types is very unstructured. While there seems to be a large variety of spaces that are linked with electricity consumption, a lack of effort in defining and differentiating these spaces is causing issues. Specifically, problems of knowledge transfer may mislead other researchers into benchmarking and comparing their data with incompatible studies. Olofsson et al. [93] mentioned inconsistencies in defining key terms in international research which led to complications when comparing works. Fortunately, disclaimers are more common in recent literature outlining the dangers of applying reported EUIs across the board. Scoping Research Around the Limitations of Building Simulation Programs: Sensitivity analysis has traditionally involved using an energy model to simulate the effects of certain parameters on electricity consumption. There is a potential that following such a method limits the scope of analysis for researchers because their tested parameters are limited by the level of detail supported by the energy modeling program or model. In theory, the effects of using the existing method of sensitivity analysis are most likely negligible on the resultant model because the designers of such programs incorporate most, if not all, major variables that affect electricity consumption. However, it is unknown what effects using this methodology will have on how the problem is approached by researchers. 2) Challenges Facing Future Research: Complexity of the task: Variability in the form and use of buildings ultimately translates to a wide range of energy consumption values ­ even between similarly defined buildings (e.g. commercial, residential, etc.) As a result, it is difficult to isolate specific variables that are indicators of electricity consumption for one type of building. This in turn hinders further research into specific variables because published works do not collectively support the same variable for building types. This is a simplification of this issue as there are many other factors that are considered when selecting a model's predictor variables such as the availability of data and the scope of analysis. Transferability: Attempts to create a large database of buildings where EUIs can be calculated with confidence requires a large amount of resources. Because of this, many researchers opt 39

for smaller sample sizes to test relationships. This jeopardizes the ability for the EUIs calculated to be applied to a broader scope of buildings. As a result, the majority of current work that is available represents local snapshots of the consumption patterns for university buildings and not a robust universal benchmarking tool. Motivation: A general lack of incentive to improve existing operations exists in the community. Quite simply, the cost of electricity in the United States has been close to an all time low in the past 50 years (Figures 16 & 17). Canada also benefits from some of the lowest costs of electricity due to their existing infrastructure in hydroelectric generation [94]. As a result, the motivations to reduce consumption are primarily environmentally based which are highly susceptible to changes in personal opinion and public opinion. This creates an inhospitable environment for researchers in the field due to fluctuations in support and resources provided by the government and other stakeholders [95].

Lack of Quality Data: There is a lack of data available to researchers, limiting their ability to explore potential relationships between building characteristics and electricity consumption. For instance, CBECS is used for the majority of papers originating from the United States and is referenced by international researchers as well. This is partly due to the comprehensiveness of the survey, but it is also an indication of the lack of sources for national data available to researchers. Most countries are not fortunate enough to have established such an extensive survey of existing buildings, Canada included [97]. In these instances, smaller samples must be manually surveyed by researchers which limits the applicability of the findings and ultimately the significance; what is true at a local scale may not me expressed at a national level and what variables may seem important in a few buildings may be much less so when sampling from a much larger population. The availability of such comprehensive surveys is necessary for the growth of research in this field. Without data, researchers must spend more time and resources to gather their own data, potentially deterring research altogether.

III. METHODOLOGY Below is a basic summary of the approach used to disaggregate electricity consumption for Ryerson's cluster-metered buildings.
Gathering Building Sample

Ryerson University provided electricity consumption data for 23 utility meters on campus. 17 buildings were individually-metered. The University of Toronto supplied consumption data for 120 individuallymetered buildings

Preparing the Building Sample

28 buildings were removed from the original sample from U of T and Ryerson on the basis of size, archetype, and electricity consumption. Subsets of the entire sample were created to reduce variability in consumption allowing for greater performance from models. Three, four, and five subsets were experimented with.

Collecting Data for Predictor Variables

Participating universities provided data on the number of above and below ground floors, space usage (defined by COU categories) and electricity consumption on a per building basis. The data for footprint shape, and shared external walls was gathered through a survey of satellite imagery and maps COU space categories were amalgamated into 13 variables. This recategorization was based off of percieved energy use intensities for the original defined spaces.

Model Building

Multiple regressions were created for each subset. All possible combination of predictor variables were experimented with to determine the best models for predicting electricity consumption. The top five models from each subset with the lowest AICc score were averaged to form the final model coefficients. A weighted average was taken using the Akaike weights for each of the five candidate models.

Model Testing

Cross validation (leave-one-out) was used to test the candidate models before multimodel inference (averaging). The mean square error was calculated for each model and compared to the average electricity consumption to determine the predictive error or root mean square error. The final averaged models were applied to Ryerson's cluster-metered buildings. Depending on their size, one of four models was used to estimate electricity consumption. The raw estimates from the models were adjusted after a comparison with the metered usage. Buildings belonging to the same cluster were compared and adjusted proportionately, regardless of the model used for estimation.

Model Application

IV. MODEL DEVELOPMENT As shown in the literature review, there are many variables that have a proven relationship with electricity consumption in buildings. Therefore, estimating electricity consumption from variables can be flexible depending on a particular project's limitation. For Ryerson University, and potentially other academic institutions, a financial limitation exists which narrow down the number of variables that can be considered when trying to estimate electricity consumption. By favoring variables that are measured and collected on a regular basis ­ for purposes other than to estimate consumption ­ the time and costs associated with this method are minimized. The variables selected to relate with electricity consumption have been cited in exiting literature as being effective predictors but are simple to measure and report for untrained staff. This way of estimation is not to compete with existing methods, rather it is to compliment and provide a low-cost option for gauging consumption in a transparent way. The variables studied in this thesis were narrowed down from an exhaustive list created during preliminary work. Table IV represents an early attempt to prioritize certain building characteristics according to their level of impact on electricity consumption. The Table was annotated with published data ([29, 65, 98]) to help make informed decisions on variable selection. Since this is an exhaustive list of variables, all components were considered regardless of the availability of data. Beside each indicator is a check signifying whether it affects a key load component in education buildings. Given the resources available, it was determined that the variables outlined in Figure 18 would provide a fair opportunity to test the performance of the methodology. Space usage and area-related variables form the majority of the model elements because of the detailed data available and also because of the great potential for space usage to indirectly affect electricity consumption; many indicators in Table IV are influenced to varying degrees by the primary activity for the space. The remaining variables include the number of above and below ground levels, a ratio for the unexposed building envelope, and a categorical variable representing six common footprint shapes. Greater details on these variables are disclosed in the following sections.

The form of the multiple linear regression is expressed in (1). In total, a maximum of 18 variables can be included in the regression. No climate-related variable is included in the regression because it is envisioned that coefficients will be updated annually, even if the model terms are the same from one year to the next. The following section will focus on gathering and priming data for the 18 variables, and the steps taken to create the resultant models which will eventually be used to estimate consumption for Ryerson buildings.  = ! + where  ! ! ! is the annual electricity consumption; is the coefficient of the variable; is the value for the predictor variable; is the error term or constant

A. Data Collection 1) Electricity Consumption Data: Measuring and verifying electricity consumption data for the buildings used in this thesis were outside of the scope of research. All consumption data for

45

buildings used was provided by university staff from Ryerson University and the University of Toronto (U of T). Data in the form of monthly/annual kW and kWh for 23 meters on campus was provided by Ryerson's Campus Facilities and Sustainability [99]. The electricity meters represent 17 individual buildings and 14 buildings in five clusters ­ more information can be found in the Statement of Problem subsection and Figure 7. The supplied files contained userentered summary sheets for the various meters on campus measuring electricity consumption. They were distinguished by utility meter and covered the academic fiscal years (May to April) between 1990 and 2009. An example of the consumption data provided can be found in Appendix C1. A sample size of 17 buildings provides very little flexibility for statistical analysis. The sample set would be further reduced when preparing the training set due to the removal of unsuitable buildings/space types such as parking garages and non-traditional academic buildings. As a result, in order to increase the dataset to allow for more variations in built form and consumption patterns typical of university buildings, and to increase the chances of creating a reliable model, a request was sent to the University of Toronto to provide the necessary data in order for their buildings to be added to the Ryerson sample. U of T's 2013/2014 operating budget of $1.9 billion greatly exceeds Ryerson University's $500 million and is an indication of the size of the institution [100, 101]. Since weather and climate conditions are not being considered as a variable in the model (i.e. all buildings within Ryerson's campus will be exposed to very similar conditions due to its compactness), using U of T's buildings to supplement the sample size is ideal because the centers of each campus are roughly only 1.45 km apart [102], thereby reducing the climatic effects on energy consumption. The University of Toronto supplied electricity consumption data for 120 buildings for the 2012 fiscal year. This number varies from year to year depending on new construction, demolition, and renovation activities taken place during that year. The consumption data supplied covers the years between 2005 and 2012, and is reported on an annual basis. In addition to providing the metered usage of a particular building, U of T has documented their estimates on the

46

amount of energy gained or lost by receiving or providing chilled water to/from other buildings. At Ryerson University, two central chillers are responsible for supplying chilled water to service 77% of the total floor area on campus. Another 9% of the total floor area is serviced by Toronto's existing Deep Lake Water Cooling System, with the remaining area serviced by self cooling systems (i.e. non-centralized) [33]. The implications of this mixed system is that approximately 2/3 of all Ryerson buildings' electricity meters do not account for the energy spent on active cooling - these are accounted for in two buildings specifically, which result in inflated electricity readings. Between 1990 and 2012, the Library building cluster, which provides cooling for 10 other buildings, had an electricity intensity of 291 kWh/m2/annum, a 53% increase over buildings relying on self cooling systems. To address this apparent issue, U of T has allocated a portion of energy consumption from buildings with central chillers to buildings being served chilled water. For the purposes of this thesis, the estimates for the consumption values with the chilled water allocation applied are used for U of T buildings. To match the more recent years of data supplied by the University of Toronto, Ryerson supplied updated data for the months between 2010 and 2012. It was noted that there were differences in consumption for overlapping months in 2010 with the original dataset; in these cases, the more recent data replaced those months. It was determined that models would be created using the most recent data available instead of using the historic averages due to unique consumption patterns for campus buildings that were difficult to generalize (i.e. not a uniform increase or decrease of electricity consumption over time). Models for 2010 and 2011 academic years will also be pursued to determine the significance and sensitivity of parameters over time. However, only models created with 2012 data will be used for estimating consumption for Ryerson University buildings. The sample of buildings from Ryerson University and the University of Toronto were refined by eliminating observations that were either suspect or did not adhere to certain characteristics typical of large academic institutions. First, outliers were identified for Ryerson's sample using the interquartile range calculated using historic data. Entries outside of 1.5 standard deviations

47

from the upper and lower quartiles were flagged and omitted from further analysis, including the calculation of averages. Detailed historic data for utilities was not provided by U of T making it difficult for this type of outlier identification to be made with their buildings. Instead, outliers were rejected based on the coefficient of variance. This coefficient was first calculated for Ryerson buildings to determine the variance within the sample after outliers were removed. The maximum variance, 0.135, was found for consumption between 2010 and 2012. This variance was used as a guide to set an appropriate limit (0.15) for the coefficient of variance for U of T buildings. Buildings that exceeded the prescribed threshold were flagged for scrutiny; in some cases, the variance exhibited between 2010 and 2012 were spread across all three years while at other times, a clear distinction between one year and the other two existed. Depending on the situation, either the year with the suspect data was eliminated from the set or the entire building was removed. Second, the samples were scanned for suspect data entries potentially stemming from human error. This included entries that were repeated for several months but also included larger interruptions in reliable data including renovation work. For instance, Ryerson's bookstore was closed for almost 10 years for renovation and surrounding construction work leading to a significant drop in electricity consumption during those years. To preserve the accuracy of energy usage at the bookstore building, those entries were omitted because it was assumed that the building was closed to the public. In some cases, the months leading up to or after the closing or opening of a building is distorted which may be due to adjustments and optimization of building systems to meet the changes in the number of occupants. Often, these months are also identified during outlier identification, such as the opening of Ryerson's George Vasi Engieering and Computer Center, where three months were withheld from the final dataset. An example of outlier identification for Ryerson's individually metered buildings can be seen in Appendix C2. Third, select campus buildings have a very small footprint which are not typical for academic buildings. They often serve as sporadic administrative offices to be further developed when the need arises. In addition, smaller buildings are most susceptible to variations in energy use intensities. They are often difficult to model, regardless of the method of estimation, and therefore have been removed from the sample. For the purposes of this thesis, small buildings have been defined as ones 48

with internal floor areas less than 1000 m2. Related to this criterion are academic buildings in the form of houses. With the removal of smaller buildings, many houses have been removed from the sample, however larger houses can still persist. Since core academic buildings are typically not contained within houses, these were also removed. Parking garages, while not traditionally associated with academic buildings, exist in the sample because they are often not separately metered when constructed below a building. Because of this, freestanding garages were also left in the sample in hopes that the model will be able to associate car parks with low energy consumption. Figure 19 shows the proportion of eliminated buildings from the combined Ryerson and U of T building sample; the buildings eliminated under "Outliers" refers to a procedure yet to be detailed (refer to section C. Creating Subsets).

2) Council of Ontario University Survey Data: The Council of Ontario University (COU) represents 21 publicly funded institutions in the province of Ontario. As a member institution, the universities are required to measure and submit various operation and usage statistics on a regular basis. Included in these submissions are detailed area measurements for defined spaces in campus buildings. Examples of these space categories include central administrative office and related spaces and health service facilities which are both defined, along with the other 18 categories (a total of 47 subcategories) in [103].

49

The council of Ontario Universities first pursued a space formula and inventory classification system in 1967. Four years later, they established four task forces to examine questions relating to capital funding and the utilization of physical facilities within Ontario universities. One task force was dedicated to developing and testing a space utilization guide, two examined the space needs of education and health sciences, and the final task force studied the various aspects of building costs. In total, five reports (Building Block Series) were published from their collective findings which covered two major elements of the capital formula: space and cost. The eventual testing and subsequent revisions of the formulas were tested on five Ontario universities. In 1972, a subcommittee was appointed to continue the work on the Building Block Series and to receive comments and recommendations from Ontario universities. The space standards were reviewed and revised to reflect current teaching and research conditions in 1984 and in 1992, the first edition of the COU Building Blocks was published; periodic revisions of the standard have since taken place [103]. A comprehensive timeline of the development of the COU Space Standards can be seen in Appendix C3. The original motives for developing a capital formula were to promote equity and objectivity, consistent standards, an opportunity for the provincial government to influence their financial obligations, and to provide an incentive for institutions to properly manage and allocate their resources. In order to accomplish these tasks a survey of physical facilities takes place on a triennial basis. Information on space inventory, student enrolment, full-time faculty and staff positions, lab contact hours, and library collection volumes is gathered between the months of January and April, sometimes with the help of students. This information is used to monitor changes in space needs, as well as to calculate capital funding requirements for the university system as a whole for the government. Outside the COU, the data is used by the Canadian University Reciprocal Insurance Exchange to determine the value of university facilities for insurance purposes. The Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities also uses the data to make informed decisions on allocating funds to each institution through the Facilities Renewal Program. Lastly, institutions themselves use the gathered data for a variety of reports including proposals and internal planning [103]. While the COU data is unique and extremely

50

useful, it is not without faults. Specific to the inventory of space, the age of facilities is not considered despite it being recognized as having potentially significant impacts on efficiency and usability of spaces. Secondly, while the definitions of COU space categories are specific, there is room for interpretation between one administrator and another. Nevertheless, the opportunity to harness the gathered COU data to correlate with electricity consumption exists.

Figure 20 The proportion of spaces under COU space categories for architecture buildings at the University of Toronto and Ryerson University.

2012 data for COU space categories was gathered from Ryerson University [104] and U of T [105] from their respectful facilities and planning offices on interior areas defined within each category for every building on campus. At U of T, an official audit of spaces is taken every three years by upper level administrative staff for the department while at Ryerson, a less formalized approach is taken with ongoing updates to the VisonFM database throughout the year by a Facility Analyst. Figure 20 illustrates the space usage at architecture buildings from both

51

universities. Typical non-specific education facilities at Ryerson University tend to dedicate roughly a third of their spaces each to offices, laboratories, and "other" spaces. More specialized or smaller buildings, and those housing centralized heating/cooling equipment, are excluded from this generalization. Spaces categorized under "other" include circulations spaces, washrooms, elevator shafts, and stairwells, among other things. Aggregating the COU categories based on perceived end-uses results in a simplified and easier to interpret diagram (Figure 21).

Of the 53 space categories that define Ryerson University and the University of Toronto's space usage, four have a proportion of total area of 5% or more, (Table V, a full list can be seen in Appendix C4). If the raw space categories were used to develop a model, many buildings would be excluded from the sample because they lack those specialized spaces that may be required to estimate consumption. The robustness of the model would suffer with the inclusion of highly specific space usage variables. For this reason, an attempt was made to group COU space categories together based on estimated energy use intensities (Figure 22 & Figure 23). For instance, daycare facilities and lounge spaces serve distinct functions however their energy demand is expected to be similar due to how the occupants are behaving. Another example of grouping similar categories is athletic activity and seating spaces; many of these spaces refer to arenas and courts where the seating and activity area are conditioned as one space. After a quick visual assessment of how university spaces at Ryerson were categorized, the COU data was simplified based on the following criteria: occupant density, hours of use, conditioning requirements, plug loads, and lighting intensity. This re-categorization of spaces is a necessary critical step that will undoubtedly affect the performance of the model. The risks assumed here are less than those of alternative pathways: either selecting a sample of space usage categories based on their perceived effects on electricity consumption or simply basing selection on a space's popularity on campus. The first option, creating models with a select few categories, requires an amount of justification that doesn't exist. A lack of precedent studies and

53

knowledge for linking categories with their effects on electricity consumption makes it difficult to establish confidence when prioritizing certain categories over others. Further, how many categories should be selected from the set, and what balance of space categories with high and low energy demand should be considered? These unanswered questions further deterred progress down this path. The second option, using only the most common space usage categories, is illogical. If significant categories were arbitrarily defined as those with a proportion of 3% or more, that would result in 69% of all areas accounted for. Not only are there spaces that share similar EUIs within the selected set (Table V), but also, almost one third of spaces are not considered. Since it has been previously established that academic spaces suffer from highly variable EUIs, many of the eliminated spaces may have a very high impact on energy consumption in a few number of buildings. A self-directed reorganization of the COU data was superior to the other two options discussed for another crucial reason. Since there are numerous individuals interpreting the space definitions, there may be cases where staff members categorize similar areas differently ­ especially where multiple subcategories exist. For example, the definition for Category 4.2 Research Office/Project Space is very similar to Category 2.2 Unscheduled Class Laboratory Space despite the fact that they belong to different categories. By grouping categories based on expected EUI, the bias introduced by many human actors interpreting the COU space definitions is replaced solely by the author's own accountable and disclosed bias. The grouping of COU categories is one of many possible ways to extract information on electricity consumption tied to certain space types. It is evident that further work in this area of how best to utilize COU space usage data is needed to make better-informed decisions for future studies.

3) Other Building Data: The data for the remaining variables that were collected ­ building footprint shape, the number of shared walls, and the number of above and below ground floors ­ were relatively less work intensive to prepare before analysis. The data on above and below ground floors was provided by Ryerson and U of T [104, 105]. No further differentiation was made between levels serving as an extension of the building and those serving as underground parking (which was only identified in one of the buildings) ­ the space usage variable partially accounts for that. The number of floors above ground level was obtained by taking the highest reported floor ­ ignoring floors where no assignable areas existed. In a few cases, the floors occupied by the universities only accounted for a fraction of all floors in a building. This scenario causes a misrepresentation of the actual number of floors the university occupies. For instance, if a university owns the 16th and 17th floor of a 20-floor building, the data entry for that building would read 17 above ground floors; 17 floors is nether the highest floor count for the building nor is it the number for floors occupied by the university. Fortunately, this issue exists only in a few buildings of the total sample and only for above ground floors; nine buildings from U of T and Ryerson exhibit occupation on fewer floors than the total count, and even less are found in the working sample. A potential solution to this

56

problem is to split the two floor count variables into three: one for accounting for the number of floors the university occupies in a building and the other two for documenting the highest and lowest floor of the building, regardless of the tenant. Applied to the example above, the variables for floor count would be two, for the number of university occupied floors, and 20, for the maximum floor count above ground. Whether or not this will have a measurable impact on model performance (given the infrequency of this issue) should be a focus in future work.

Figure 24 Screenshot of Apple's Maps program which was used to survey building geometry on both campuses.

Building footprint shape and the number of shared walls was measured by analyzing various cartographic data supplied by the universities [31, 106], Google [102] and Apple [107]. 3D satellite imagery and Google's Street View feature allowed the survey of building geometry and their surroundings to be completed efficiently (Figure 24). With respect to building shape, six footprint shapes were selected, for the purposes of this thesis, to categorize the academic buildings found within the working sample (Figure 25). In general, categorizing footprint shapes was a simple task with only a few buildings causing any conflict. Those buildings tended to have podiums where the tower portion of the building had a different floor shape than the base. Also some buildings consisted of multiple buildings which differed in shape. For these instances, a null value was used when no prevailing shape could be determined. This was done on a case-by-case basis as each instance presented a unique set of characteristics to consider.

57

A value ranging from one to six represented the footprint shapes; with this being the only categorical variable considered in the equation, the value is of no importance.

Figure 25 Six footprint shapes used to categorize academic buildings

The variable "shared walls" represents the number of surfaces (walls and roof) the building envelope comes into contact with, from neighboring buildings. It is a simple measure to account for the amount of exposed surface area, a factor that has been associated with energy calculations [65]. For the greater majority of buildings (89%), no shared walls were found. Those with shared surfaces were specifically for walls, with the exception of one Ryerson building ­ a bookstore whose roof was under an above-ground parking garage. A shielded roof affects heat loss and energy consumption for a building to a greater extent, when compared to a wall. Despite this, no differentiation was made in this variable between surface types because of the limited instances of a covered roof in the studied sample. Partial shared walls were accounted for by using fractions. A drawback for how this variable is measured is that it does not consider the relative area that is covered and uncovered. Potentially, this means that two buildings sharing the same number of shared walls may perform differently due to their surface area to volume ratio. Nevertheless, this tradeoff is made to promote simplicity in the methodology. An attempt was made to reduce the potential for an inflated shared wall variable by only counting surfaces where a significant surface area relative to the total was shared with another building. This added step may be difficult to instruct future users on. B. R Programming The statistical software used to create and test multiple linear regressions is R [108]. R is both the language and the environment for statistical computing and graphics. The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather

58

than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is typically the case with other data analysis software [109]. It is popular among statisticians and data miners due to its flexibility and extensibility. It was first developed in 1993 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and has grown substantially in recent years, both in popularity and in advancement. A more detailed history of R and its contributors can be seen in Ihaka [110]. Without a native graphical interface, R relies on a command line interface to interpret the language R, which is similar to MATLAB. The primary functions used to obtain the regression models will be detailed below which include: multi-model inference, cross-validation for generalized linear models, and stepwise variance inflation factor selection. Each function's script can be seen in Appendix C5. 1) Stepwise Variance Inflation Factor Selection: In order to build statistical models with significant predictor variables, collinearity among variables needs to be addressed. This is especially true for this thesis because data dredging was used and also because of the similarities in predictor variables (i.e. 14 of them dealing with floor area). By reducing collinearity, independent variables are distanced from one another resulting in stronger and truer relationships in the resultant models. Collinearity is represented by variance inflation factors (VIF) where a higher number equates to stronger collinearity among variables. VIF is calculated by taking the inverse of the coefficient of determination (r2) for the regression between one predictor variable, j, against all others (2). ! =
!
! !!!!

(2)

The VIFs are then used to screen out variables with high collinearity. The custom script from Beck [111] allows for the stepwise selection of variables based on VIF (i.e. VIF is calculated each time a variable is removed from the set). Since the VIFs change significantly with each iteration, this ensures that all remaining predictor variables are under the defined threshold.

59

2) Multi-Model Inference (Dredge): As eluded to previously, data dredging was the method used to create candidate models. In R, the dredge function creates all possible combinations of explanatory variables and ranks them by a defined information criterion ­ in this thesis, Akaike Information Criterion is used (AIC). The number of models evaluated in Dredge is exponentially related to the number of predictor variables; with the removal of collinear variables, the number of models fitted in each subset (refer to section C. Creating Subsets) did not exceed 262,144. AICc denotes AIC adjusted for smaller sample sizes ­ a greater penalty is assigned for extra model parameters compared to AIC. Both measures are interpreted the same however due to the small sample size in this thesis, AICc is used. AIC is a metric used to evaluate competing models by considering the goodness of fit as well as the complexity. As opposed to r2 or adjusted r2, a measure of explained variance in the response variable by predictor variables, AIC seeks to identify parsimonious models [73, 112]. AIC is a relative value and cannot be compared to models from other subsets or other studies. The difference in AIC between models dictates the amount of information gained or lost; a delta between the lowest AIC and a competing model's is substantial if under two. Information can still be gained from models with a delta of 10 but with much less support [73]. When there are several models that have a delta of less than two, it is possible to average the models, a process known as multimodel inference [113]. A drawback of relying on dredge results to formulate a model is that its coefficients will be specific to the sample used for training. Using AIC will guarantee the best fitting model, not the most universal model. This is acceptable for our applications, but for research towards a model applicable to a wider scope of academic institutions, dredge may not be appropriate. 3) Cross-Validation for Generalized Linear Models: In order to validate the models identified through Dredge, they need to be tested on a new set of data that was not used to construct the model. Because the sample size was limited in each subset, the group was not further divided into a training and test set which is what is commonly done when data is not scarce. Instead, Leave-one-out Cross-validation [114, 115], where one observation from the subset is omitted during model building and used to validate the subsequent model, was used to gauge

60

performance ­ comparing the predicted and actual electricity consumption for that building. Examples of studies dealing with energy consumption in buildings using cross-validation can be seen in [116] and [117]. The removed observation was then reintegrated into the subset and used in the next iteration of model building and testing ­ with a new building being used for validation. This was repeated until all buildings in the subset had been "left out" once (i.e. used to test), and an associated error rate had been calculated. In total, a subset containing 20 buildings had 20 unique errors that were then averaged for each model in the form of a mean square error (MSE). A general schematic of this method can be seen in Figure 26.

Figure 26 Example of leave-one-out cross validation with 10 samples. [118]

C. Creating Subsets Breaking down the sample into subsets was required in order for a variety of building types and sizes to be considered. Even after eliminating buildings with an interior area below 1000 m2, removing houses from the sample, and omitting outlier data, there was a great deal of variation in area, electricity consumption, and energy use intensity, as shown in Table VI. Creating a static model to represent this level of diversity would likely result in poor and unreliable performance. In order to address this, subsets of the sample set were created so that 61

multiple static models could be created to represent each group. There were many options available on how to divide the sample such as by archetype, or construction date however those would require additional resources for future users to collect. Instead, the total interior floor area was used as the boundary condition to separate the buildings. Since many of the variables in the model are derived from floor area, it is important to divide buildings in such a way that their EUIs are distinct from one group to another. Figure 27 shows the relationship between two possible indicators and EUI: interior floor area and whole building electricity consumption. Selecting a factor that yields a strong correlation with EUI is ideal but since both factors show a weak relationship (r2 = 0.36 for electricity consumption and 0.19 for floor area), the criteria shifts to one that spreads EUI values the most. Floor area is superior in this aspect which is partially why it was chosen to define subsets. The other reason behind its selection was the difficulty for buildings with unknown consumption levels to be placed in one subset; determining which model is most applicable to estimating consumption is a critical step in this methodology. The boundaries were created by using interquartile ranges of the building interior floor areas. This ensured that the number of individuals in each subset are similar, if not equal. University campuses tend to have a few exceedingly large buildings that offset the rest of the buildings (Figure 28) ­ if equal ranges in area are used to divide the sample, the number of individuals in each group would be highly skewed. The number of subsets created was arbitrarily set at four however performance with three and five sets were created for performance tests.

Within each subset, an additional test for outliers was done to ensure that variance within each subset was acceptable. Using the standard deviation method, as outlined in the Electricity Consumption Data subsection, buildings with a consumption value outside of 2 standard deviations away from the mean of the subset were withheld. This resulted in four buildings being removed from the 2012 and 2010 years, and three from 2011. The areas used to define each subset are shown in Figure 29; Table VII displays descriptive statistics for each of these defined subsets.

D. Building Subset Details Data for each of the defined subsets used to create and test the models is displayed in Tables VIII ­ XI. As discussed in the previous Section, subsets were created to reduce the variance observed with electricity consumption in academic buildings and to allow for more accurate models to be created. The subsets are defined by interior floor area which will also determine which of the four equations are used to estimate consumption for a particular building. All area-related variables (c1-c12 & Interior Floor Area) are measured in square meters and "2012 Electricity Consumption", in kWh.

A great deal of variation can be seen in the re-categorized COU categories (Figure 22) which is to be expected. Specialized space variables such as c12 (living spaces), and c4 (athletic spaces) are almost nonexistent in smaller buildings. c9, mainly representing circulation spaces, is closely related to the total interior floor area of the building and can be found in all buildings. The majority of buildings across all subsets do not share a surface with one or more buildings and have at least one below ground level.

67

IV. RESULTS A. Candidate Models The results from Dredge provided an exhaustive list of models for each subset. The list of models with an AICc delta of 7 or less can be seen for each subset in Appendix D1 [73]. The models used for further analysis were the top five models ranked by AICc for each subset (Table XII). The number of variables chosen for the models ranged from one to five with the larger buildings generally utilizing more variables. One reason for this may be that larger buildings have a value for more space categories than smaller ones. Another interesting observation is that space categories 5, 6, 7, and 11 consistently have negative coefficients while categories 2, 3, and 9 have positive ones. Aside from the obvious linkages that can be made to the energy demands of each unique space (which cannot completely explain the observations), the negative and positive coefficients can be attributed to the expected hours of occupation for those spaces. Using the results from Davis and Nutter [119], who assigned occupancy factors for common university spaces, a common factor among space categories assigned a negative coefficient were their scheduled usage. For instance, classroom, their support spaces, and student eateries all handle occupants at regular intervals during the week. This is in contrast to the spaces with positive coefficients such as research laboratories and plant/maintenance areas which may handle the same number of occupants but dispersed over many hours of the week. This deduction is only a possibility of the true mechanisms at work; further analysis is required to make any further conclusions. The weights of space-related variables are much less than above and below ground floors and the number of shared walls ­ this is only an indication of the sensitivity of these variables rather than their importance over one another. Variables with distinct units cannot be compared with one another in any meaningful way. Below ground floors seem to be more significant in modeling electricity usage for buildings smaller than 6,683 m2, while buildings larger than that rely on above ground floors. The number of surfaces shared with another building is found to be significant in determining the electricity consumed but it is not commonly relied upon.

68

Surprisingly, no models utilized the data on building footprint to estimate consumption. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that its effects on electricity use are relatively low compared to the other studied variables. Lastly, models for subset 4, containing buildings greater than 14,950 m2, all have intercepts below zero. It is difficult to infer too much information about the predictor variables and electricity consumption because causality has not been established in this body of work, nor inferred from existing literature. These models merely represent correlations between select predictor variables and electricity consumption.

Figure 30 Performance of top models for all subsets using consumption data from 2010 to 2012. The larger the error, the less accurately the model has predicted consumption for buildings in that subset.

Figure 30 shows the coefficient of variation of the root-mean-square-error, CV(RMSE), for the top models for each subset across three years of data, calculated through cross-validation. Focusing on 2012 data, performance is similar between subsets 1 and 3; the second subset had the worst performing models and the fourth, the best. A general decrease in accuracy can be seen for earlier years which is an interesting trend because predictor variables were not updated for 2010 and 2011 models (due to a lack of data). This implies that using data that does not correspond to a particular year's consumption data potentially hinders the performance of top models. As Figure 30 represents average errors, it is difficult to conclude that using a particular model will result in a specific error for all buildings within the subset. 70

Additionally, models with a lower average reported error have the possibility of being less accurate than other models when used on certain buildings. Instead, average errors show which models perform better (more accurate) when considering all buildings within each subset. Because of this fact, it is sometimes beneficial for models within a similar error range to be combined and averaged in hopes that performance gains from multiple models can be incorporated into the final model ­ a practice which is further explained in subsection C. Application of Models on Ryerson's Individually-Metered Buildings.

Figure 31 Model performance created using three and five subsets. Models resulting in an error rate above 100% are omitted.

As mentioned in Model Development, the use of four subsets was initially set arbitrarily. The process of creating and testing models was repeated for buildings divided into three and five subsets to see their effects on performance (Figure 31). With five subsets, the models created in the first set perform better than the original case with four subsets. Also, performance from the third subset onwards does not seem to improve as they do with the original case. Performance from three subsets mirrors the trend found with four subsets: an error rate around 40% for smaller buildings, which increases in the second subset, before finally settling around 20% for large buildings. Figure 31 indicates that performance from models seems to improve when a finer scale is used for smaller buildings. In addition, little impact on performance is made with the inclusion of more buildings at the larger end of the floor area spectrum.

71

Potentially, this means that the methods used here would benefit most from using smaller area intervals to define subset boundaries for small buildings, and larger area intervals for large buildings. B. Application of Models on Ryerson's Individually-Metered Buildings In order to reduce model selection bias in situations where there is a small sample size relative to the number of variables, multi-model inference or model averaging is used which promotes confidence in the results [83]. Top candidate models presented in Table XII are averaged based on their Akaike weights, which represents the relative likelihood of that model being true over all others. Coefficients for the top five models in each subset are averaged and shown in the first row after each header in Table XIII. Below the model coefficients are the values for the variables called upon. For instance, Oakham house (OAK) has one below ground floor, 1,686 m2 of floor space categorized as c6, and 1,120 m2 in c9. The sum of the intercept with the products of all terms results in the initial 2012 electricity consumption for that building.

72

Table XIII Final averaged models applied to each cluster-metered building at Ryerson. Displayed below the model's coefficients are the values for the building variables. Different clusters are identified by colour.

The adjusted estimate for each building is determined by comparing the estimated electricity consumption for each cluster with the meter readings in 2012. Depending on the difference between the two values, a constant multiplier is applied to all buildings in that cluster in order to increase the chances of accurate results. Important to note is that buildings from each cluster may be modeled using different equations. Figure 32 shows the raw estimates for cluster-metered Ryerson buildings and their 2012 electricity meter readings. Accuracy of the

73

estimates ranged from an underestimate of 29% (JOR.LIB.POD.RAC) to an overestimate of 20% (EPH.SHE) with an average error rate across all five clusters at 14.8%. Electricity estimates for the JOR.LIB.POD.RAC cluster were adjusted the most (increase of 42%); on average however, the clusters were corrected by 16.8%. The relatively large difference observed between estimated and actual electricity consumption for the JOR.LIB.POD.RAC cluster may be attributed to the location of a large centralized cooling system that provides cooling for 10 other campus buildings, which was previously discussed in the Model Development section. EPH.SHE's consumption may have been overestimated due to the fact that they are considered by the model to be two separate buildings (with significant shared surfaces) when in fact SHE is more of an extension of EPH. Lastly, the differences seen in the SCC.OAK.HEI cluster is questionable due to a lack of updated data for the meter; the value shown in Figure 32 represents electricity consumption that has been lowered by 11% (average decrease of all buildings from 2008 and 2012 ­ 12% for all cluster-metered buildings) from its last reported consumption in 2008.

V. DISCUSSION A. Model Performance Figure 32 previously summarizes the accuracy of the estimated electricity consumption for each of Ryerson's building clusters. While this provides some insight into the accuracy of the developed models, their level of performance can be misleading. The reported errors can be cancelled from multiple buildings resulting in a false sense of accuracy for individual buildings within the cluster. In order to combat this, a comparison of results between this project is made with Rahman's [33] work, which was completed in 2010. Rahman studied the feasibility of using a Heat Recovery Ventilation system and expanding Toronto's Deep Lake Water Cooling system to cover Ryerson's buildings. In order to quantify the benefits of reduced energy consumption and GHG emissions in these scenarios, an energy audit was completed for 16 buildings (86% of Ryerson's total floor area), followed by energy simulations based on 2006 data using Carrier HAP (Hourly Analysis Program). The results from simulations for buildings that were covered by this thesis and Rahman's are shown in Figure 33.

Figure 33 Comparison of estimated electricity consumption from this study with the simulated results from [33].

In most instances, the adjustments made to the original estimates for individual buildings further distances the results from Rahman's. Only four of eleven buildings see a decrease in the difference between the simulated and model-estimated values. The reason why Rahman's results can be relied upon as a benchmark is due to its reported accuracy. Comparing the performance on two individual buildings (whose consumption is known), his results for the Engineering Building (ENG) and the School of Interior Design (SID) yielded an error of 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Using the averaged models created in this thesis, the error for those same buildings were 36% (ENG) and 34% (SID). While the models may be more accurate, their year of estimation was six years previous to those of this study making direct comparisons difficult. Figure 34 displays the short-term trend seen for each building cluster. As mentioned previously, the SCC.OAK.HEI cluster's last fully metered year of consumption was in 2008 ­ it is 77

therefore excluded in making generalizations about consumption during 2006 and 2012. In total, electricity consumption for the remaining four clusters saw a decrease of 7% between 2008 and 2012 (complete data was not available for 2006 due to missing or outlier data). On a cluster-basis however, EPH.SHE and JOR.LIB.POD.RAC both experienced a decline during this period of 15% and 7% while VIC.IMA.CED saw an increase of 11%. A marginal 1% increase in consumption was found at the PIT.RCC cluster. From this we can tentatively conclude that that Rahman's results in Figure 34 is expected to vary from those of this thesis by a factor of 11% to -15% from usage patterns alone. Again, it is difficult to ascertain the fluctuations found within individual clusters meaning that the differences in estimated consumption from this study and Rahman [33] may be due to an actual increase or decrease in electricity consumption between 2006 and 2012, or may originate from low precision between both methods.

Comparisons can be made with measured consumption data on a cluster-basis (Figure 35). As expected, energy simulations run by Rahman [33] yielded more accurate results than the multiple regressions created in this thesis. Of the five clusters, one of them (PIT.RCC) is more accurately estimated using regression analysis. Comparing the average error between the two methods, the Carrier HAP models were roughly 3 times as accurate than the models used here (4.4% vs 14.8%). As mentioned in the Results section, the error associated with EPH.SHE and JOR.LIB.POD.RAC clusters may be inflated due to unique circumstances not found elsewhere in the building sample. This comparison highlights the performance gains from using energy simulations over statistical models. However, as earlier mentioned, the methods introduced in this thesis are not to compete with existing methods, such as energy simulation. Instead, it is to offer another solution for scenarios where the need for information gain is to be maximized with as few resources available. Consideration has yet to be given to the methods behind each approach. Arguably, the methods in [33] are more work intensive and undoubtedly more technical in nature when compared to this thesis. The detailed inputs required for energy simulations are extensive and may or may not be transferrable to other buildings; each building's performance is predicted with a unique model whereas using statistical models, only four equations are required to model the majority of academic buildings. Ultimately, it is left for the user to decide whether the difference in accuracy between the two methods is significant. For most planning applications, the accuracy of the regression approach may be suitable for prioritizing certain buildings over others. In cases where a detail breakdown of energy end uses is needed, such as when selecting which energy efficiency measure will be most effective, simulations may be the best choice. These conclusions can only be made confidently with more comparisons of different methods on the same building sample ­ an area with much needed growth. With numerous modeling programs to choose from, the error results may vary considerable with other programs. Carrier HAP is not a common choice among academics but its modeling abilities are comparable to current standards (DOE 2.1, eQUEST) [120].

B. Significance of Model Variables Of the 18 variables selected for analysis, only 11 of those were deemed significant when estimating electricity consumption in academic buildings. A summary of the finalized linear models is shown in Table XIV. This section will focus on the 11 variables and determine whether or not the variations in their weightings can be explained with building science principles.

80

Table XIV Model variables for each subset

81

In order to better understand the model coefficients, a closer look at the properties of the buildings within each subset is needed. Since there were only 20 buildings in each subset, the observations should not be extended to the entire building population or even to all academic buildings. They should instead be treated as nuances, unique to the building sample used (U of T and Ryerson University buildings). Figures 36 ­ 38 compare the values for each variable across all subsets. Focusing on floor levels, it is evident that larger buildings tend to have an extended upper range of floor levels compared to smaller buildings; subsets 1 and 2 peak at three or four above ground floors. These trends are much more subdued for below ground floors with only the largest buildings having three or more levels (most likely due to large underground parking structures). The equations for the first two subsets use below ground floors while the last two subsets use above ground. This indicates that the electricity consumption for buildings under 6,683 m2 is influenced more by the existence of a basement than multiple above ground floors; small building mostly either have zero or one below ground level while they range from two to seven for above ground. For the most part, the selection of this variable for smaller building makes sense however the weightings assigned to each model are questionable. A small or negative coefficient in model 1 is expected because small buildings tend to use their basement levels as storage/service spaces. In model 2 however, the coefficient is much larger ­ this may be to offset the large negative coefficients for other variables in the model, namely c7, and the relatively low intercept. For subsets 3 and 4, the large variance in above ground floors seems to impact electricity consumption more than basement levels. While it may appear that the weighting of the variable is consistent across both models, the difference in the intercept signifies that model 3 relies on above ground floors significantly more than model 4. The relatively large coefficients assigned to above and below ground variables may cause problems when estimating consumption for smaller buildings. There are instances with model/subset two where the total building consumption is less than the coefficient assigned to below ground floors. In total, 25% of the subset suffers from this, which may explain why its performance is the weakest among the four models (Figure 30). Despite this fact, the remaining

82

space usage coefficients are almost all negative and quite large which may offset the model's sensitivity to below ground floors. All in all, the variations observed with the number of floor levels seem to be governed more by the other variables of the models than any building science principle. However, the potential lack of impact the number of floors of a building has on its electricity use intensity was brought up in the Model Development section when discussing the collection of data. Nevertheless, building floor levels are statistically significant variables in the presented models.

Theoretically, as the number of shared surfaces increases for a building, its energy consumption should decrease because heat gain/loss through that surface is reduced. Because it is electricity consumption that is being predicted, the effect of shared surfaces may be minimized since no buildings in the sample rely on electric heating. Looking at Table XIV, models 3 and 4 rely on this variable to predict electricity consumption in academic buildings. However, the data for this variable is highly sporadic with only 5% of buildings showing any shared surfaces in subsets 1 and 3, 15% in subset 2, and 20% in subset 4. It can be argued that larger buildings tend to have one or more shared surfaces as oppose to their smaller

85

counterpoints; despite the building property leading to reduced heat loss, it may be an indication of an oversized building which may consume more energy. The uncommon nature of this building property, combined with the positive coefficients assigned to this variable suggests that it functions as a minor correctional term rather than one that is heavily relied on to estimate energy consumption. This critical analysis of model terms should not be used to detract from the performance of the presented models. While many of the predictor variables and their coefficients are not supported by common building science theory, their ability to predict electricity consumption in academic buildings is proven. In other words, the selected variables are statistically significant with energy consumption but their assigned weights cannot be used as a basis for building science theory without further analysis. C. Commonalities Between Omitted Academic Buildings Eliminating buildings with an area smaller than 1000 m2 was unavoidable due to extreme variations in electricity consumption in published studies as well as those found in the building sample. Stemming from the same logic, a blanket approach to removing houses from the sample is also used. Electricity consumption in houses is assumed to be noticeably different and is not included in the definition of a typical multi-use academic facility. A less blunt approach could be taken, considering other building properties that may lead to high variation in electricity consumption, but that level of research is outside the scope of this project. Outliers were identified in two stages. Buildings were first identified as outliers when their 2010-2012 electricity consumption exceeded their historic usage. This could have been caused by a number of reasons as discussed in Model Development. The buildings were eliminated from the sample because of their flux in consumption which a static model would struggle with. The second stage of outlier identification occurred after establishing the subsets for model building. Here, buildings were eliminated if their consumption was significantly higher (>2x) than the average within the subset. It is these buildings that are of interest in this section to

86

determine if there are identifiable trends that will indicate whether a building will be able to be modeled using the regressions created in this thesis.

Table XV lists details about the four buildings that were eliminated at the second stage of outlier identification for the 2012 model year. All buildings removed from the sample are buildings from the University of Toronto. They share very few commonalities in construction type and year of construction but they manage to consume significantly more electricity than other buildings. A closer look at the study variables reveals major differences in space usage (Figures 39 ­ 42). Across all buildings, significant offsets from the subset average can be seen in c2, c3, c8, and c12. When factoring in the direction of the offset, only c12 (residential spaces) is consistently below the subset average while the other differences are varied. It is important to note that buildings within the first two subsets measured zero for many of the space categories (8 and 7 for subsets 1 and 2). The significant differences (<33% or >300%) in the two smaller buildings were almost always smaller than the average; the differences in the larger two buildings were more balanced. Aside from space usage, not many differences were found between outliers and their respectful subsets. Other than the first subset, the outliers were not the largest buildings, nor did they contain major differences in the number of shared walls and below ground levels. Greater variability was observed with above ground floors but nothing set these buildings apart from the majority. Looking at a building characteristic that wasn't directly modeled in this thesis, there is a definite possibility that plug loads for specialty equipment (specifically linked to laboratory/research spaces) are the cause of the increased energy consumption in these outlier buildings. If equipment that draws large amounts of energy is installed in lab spaces, an increase in electricity use intensity for these spaces will occur. A large increase in intensity will offset the relatively low amounts of lab-dedicated spaces in some of 88

these outlier buildings leading to a greater amount of energy consumed. By definition, lab spaces, regardless of equipment type, are categorized as one in this thesis; in future iterations it will be beneficial to adopt an approach similar to Bonnet et al. [30] (i.e. incorporating plug loads to help distinguish lab spaces).

Drawing conclusions from these differences in building characteristics is very difficult due to the pre-existing variability found in academic buildings ­ a reason why they are seldom studied. For instance Figure 43 shows the data for the c3 category (athletic service space/plant maintenance) for buildings in the fourth subset. C3 was graphed because it exhibited the most variability when comparing the outlier buildings to the averages. However, when looking at the sample, a great deal of variation still exists. On the other end of the spectrum, c9 (Circulation spaces) offsets were not deemed significant when comparing outliers to their subset averages. Figure 44 shows the data for the c9 category for the fourth offset. Indeed the variance is minimized in this case but the existence of a building with a greater offset from the average means that this type of analysis will not be effective in identifying buildings with high EUIs and thus difficult to model with a linear regression.

Identifying certain building characteristics that cause high electricity usage intensities for the four omitted buildings can possibly be done on a case-by-case basis. Justifications can be made for these anomalies by overanalyzing specific details. However, formulating general rules to apply towards other sample sizes cannot be made because of the few instances of outlier buildings that exist. Even with greater application of the models to other institutions, trends can only be identified if the same variables are collected and used to formulate the models. Instead, focus should be placed on attempting to model the highly diverse electricity consumption found in buildings with areas less than 1000 m2. These buildings represent nearly

91

20% of U of T and Ryerson's building sample, much more than the four omitted buildings due to very building-specific properties. D. Challenges to Implementing Regression Models in Other Settings The performance of the multiple linear regression models created and used on Ryerson's cluster-metered buildings shows the strength of statistics when coupled with basic building science and occupancy principles. However, there are some obstacles that need to be overcome before the successes seen in this thesis can be repeated for academic institutions in Ontario and around the world. Starting with the variables of the model, quality COU space data is required to maximize performance. As seen when using space usage data that was a year or two behind that of the measured consumption year, the models' accuracy suffered. Not only is it important to have updated data, the accuracy of the data is critical. Differences in data collection between Ryerson and U of T were detailed in the Model Development section along with issues of interpreting space definitions. These issues will continue to exist and influence model behavior as long as no formal collection method is cemented among participating universities. The Council of Ontario Universities space standards are common within the province of Ontario but receive much less attention nationally and internationally. Other provincial organizations linking universities exist within Canada including the Research Universities' Council of British Columbia, the Association of Atlantic Universities and the Bureau de Coopération Interuniversitaire. Among these groups, there are instances of adapting the COU space classifications [121] to accomplish similar goals however evidence of progress towards a uniform space standard across is limited. What this means is that equations used in this thesis will only be compatible with universities that tabulate their space usages based on the COU building blocks. Academic institutions using other definitions will benefit from the methods detailed in this thesis but will need to generate customized regressions to make use of the variables available. Climate and architecture play a critical role in determining the applicability of the algorithms developed in this thesis to other international markets. As displayed in Figure 9 in the Literature Review, the

92

electricity use intensity varies greatly from place to place due to a host of reasons including: perception of comfort, societal norms, climate, and architecture. The equations used in this thesis won't apply to these markets but, as mentioned above, the methodology prescribed will be applicable to develop customized models. Variables analyzed for model building may be similar to the ones studies in this thesis but they should be arrived at only after considering the built forms found within the academic institution(s). In other words, narrowing down model parameters should be done with a keen sense of context. The next challenge to building reliable linear models to predict electricity consumption involves building diversity. As buildings become more unique from one another ­ both in their design and function ­ their energy profile is expected to change. While this issue has not been prominent in this thesis project, it has the potential to develop in future iterations as universities invest more into the aesthetics of their facilities to attract academics and students [122]. Also, historically preserved buildings with new additions will become more commonplace as space constraints in urban campuses become a greater issue. The building sample used in this thesis contained such unique buildings mentioned above with no issue so it is difficult to gauge how effective the methods used here will be in the future. With that being said, no regression model will be future-proof for all academic buildings ­ significant predictor variables will change with time. This is because electricity consumption within buildings is highly dependent on variables that are in a state of flux. How these variables change in comparison to the others and how electricity consumption responds for that given year can result in completely different models being created. Gallachóir [97] analyzed the relationship between electricity consumption at University College Cork and its student population. It was found that historic trends dating back to the early 1980s were similar across both metrics. From 1994 and onwards, electricity consumption outpaced the growth seen in the student population. This was later attributed to the influx of personal computers on campus, increasing the plug loads. In addition, it was noticed that the energy trends for different space types were heavily influenced by the space's reliance on technology and equipment. For instance, research

93

spaces and laboratories experienced a higher rate of change in energy intensity compared to dormitories, offices, and libraries. From a practical standpoint, as buildings adopt new technologies or components that affect how energy is consumed within them, it is important to consider these changes by reevaluating model variables to improve accuracy. For example, if a substantial share of buildings within a sample utilizes high performance windows, it may be worthwhile to collect the necessary data to include that variable in the analysis process. The frequency for model reevaluation is dependent on the pace at which universities introduce new buildings into their existing building stock either through new construction or renovation, relative to the size of the sample used for model creation. In addition, it may be prompted with poor performance results from existing models. Ultimately, the institutions that this thesis is targeting is a niche population that is expected to decrease in number with time. It is hoped that the costs associated with metering utility usage on an individual building basis the methods prescribed in this thesis are used as a last resort for new academic buildings as metering and sub-metering becomes the new standard for construction. Gathering a large enough sample of buildings to construct and validate the models is a hurdle not unique to multiple linear regressions. This issue is compounded by the lack of published material on minimal or optimal sample sizes for various modeling techniques ­ it is generally recommended to include as large a sample as possible to reflect reality. An aspect of this challenge that relates to the methods used in this thesis is the prevalence of small buildings (under 1000 m2) in samples. If the target and/or sample buildings are within the range of areas that experience high variability in electricity consumption, it may be increasingly difficult to find accuracy in multiple linear regression models. The definition of what constitutes a "small building" may change from one study to the next but it is expected that this handicap will persist while dealing with the studied variables in this thesis.

94

E. Suggested Areas for Future Research 1) Model Variables: The variables considered for analysis in this thesis were selected for their balance in their relationship with electricity consumption and ease of use to measure. While they have been proven to predict consumption in academic buildings, there is a great deal of refinement that can occur that may improve performance in future iterations of the models. One of the greatest areas of contention in the methods of this thesis is the reclassification of COU space categories. The results of this thesis are due to the way the space usages are categorized, however there are a multitude of alternatives to explore. Minor changes in groupings or elimination of certain categories may potentially have profound effects on model performance. Work should be dedicated specifically on how best to harness the existing COU area database to represent energy consumption in university buildings. As discussed in the Model Development section, the variables accounting for above and below ground floors and shared building surfaces are flawed. In this thesis, the flawed approach was embraced for simplicity purposes. Future work should focus on how best to represent these building variables in models. Ultimately, the choice for how to represent floor height and exposed surface area should be left for the users of the model as their priorities shift. 2) Defining Subsets: Subsets were defined by floor area because it was a simple guideline to follow with no room for interpretation. However, creating subsets on the basis of many other factors should be explored in future work. For instance, subsets can be created with any of the existing variables analyzed in this thesis, such as COU categories, or they can be created from a new variable, such as construction type. Expanding work in this area will definitely increase the time and effort needed to create subsets for future models, especially if they are created on new variables requiring additional measurement. Another area worth revisiting was previously eluded to in the Model Development section. Reworking subset boundaries so that more models are created for smaller buildings should be pursued. Because of the difficulty in modeling smaller buildings, models should cover narrower area-intervals in hopes of capturing the unique characteristics of those buildings. This adjustment can be flipped for larger buildings, with less models dedicated to them. It is hoped that by addressing these 95

characteristics in the sample, overall prediction error for all buildings can be reduced in future iterations. 3) Multimodel Inference: Selecting the "best" model for application is another area that is highly contentious, however, unlike reclassifying COU space categories, the reasons behind this are due to external conditions. There are mixed signals from the statistical community as to how best to carry out model inference. The procedure used in this thesis was pieced together from multiple sources with several of them recommending model averaging. With that being said, there are multiple ways of selecting and/or averaging candidate models, some of which may result in a superior model than the one presented in this thesis. Again, future work should examine if there is an ideal method of model inference from dredge outputs.

4) Stepwise Versus Hierarchical Regression: An alternative model to pursue in future work is hierarchical regression [123] which differs from the stepwise regressions used in this thesis. While both approaches strive to identify the "best" set of predictor variables, they differ in key ways which will affect the resultant model. The main difference between both model types is that stepwise relies more on an automated approach, where the computer program tests the model's performance in an iterative fashion and through a series of algorithms, determines whether to keep or discard the predictor variable. Hierarchical regressions on the other hand are more reliant on the researcher's theory on relationships than the computer program's algorithm. This type of regression is best suited when groups of variables exist which exhibit some level of collinearity. These groups are introduced into the model and the variance calculated is used to determine their significance. This approach is best suited for researchers who have a sense of the key determinants of electricity consumption in their buildings and are pursuing a more universal model that applies to buildings outside of their sample.

VI. CONCLUSION There is a niche group of properties where buildings are metered in a cluster ­ due to cost saving initiatives or pre-existing metering configurations ­ and owners/managers are unable to invest the required amount to upgrade the infrastructure (i.e. individual utility

meters/submeters for each building). As a result, plans to measure and implement sustainability measures for buildings can be impeded by a lack of information. This thesis looked at a potential solution for Ryerson University to gain reliable electricity consumption data for all its cluster-metered buildings. This method is not targeted towards replacing the installation of individual meters (which provides real, up-to-date, data), rather it is a low-cost, temporary option for the realization of consumption patterns for building whose usage is concealed when measured as a group ­ a necessary first step before planning, implementing, and measuring sustainability goals can take place. The method behind creating the four regression models was identical, save for the different training and testing samples used. As predicted, the MSE decreased for models created and tested on the last two subsets (containing larger campus buildings) versus the first two. In addition, it was found that model performance would likely increase with greater segregation of buildings in the first subsets, and that performance would not be affected with the amalgamation of larger buildings from the last two subsets. Multimodel inference or model averaging of the top candidate models ranked by AICc was used to obtain the final models for each subset to be applied on Ryerson's buildings. The estimates from the four models were within a reasonable range (i.e. CV(RMSE) = 14.8%) from the measured consumption for cluster-metered buildings. These estimates, for each building, were proportionately adjusted based on the differenced observed between the estimated and measured value for each cluster. It is uncertain whether the adjusted values prove to be more accurate since the comparison with Rahman's [33] simulated 2006 results for the same buildings are mixed. Despite being roughly three times less accurate than Rahman's energy

models, the time and resources invested building and validating models seem to favour multiple linear regression, especially when estimating consumption for numerous buildings. For the most part, the coefficients assigned to the variables used by the linear regressions are not supported by building science principles. It may be suggested that feature and model selection is based off of performance metrics, rather than significant relationships, however more work is needed to make this conclusion. Academic buildings were removed from the sample for a number of reasons (archetype, size, outlier, etc.) however only those whose consumption significantly differed from the subset averages were analyzed for similarities. Not only were there no measured similarities between the outlier buildings, but their properties were not always at the extreme end of the spectrum. This either suggests that another factor, not accounted for in this thesis (e.g. lab energy intensity, as suggested in the Discussion), is responsible for their above-average electricity consumption, or that buildings simply cannot be pre-screened for compatibility with this method. In either case, more data on outlier buildings (i.e. repeat applications on other building samples) will help identify if the model suffers from limitations yet to be identified. This thesis detailed a method of estimation for academic buildings based on multiple linear regression. It is a reliable tool for Ryerson University to use for estimating electricity consumption in their cluster-metered buildings that have yet to be upgraded. Ryerson University aside, this thesis is useful for other universities or colleges where consumption data is lacking for whatever reason. It is expected that similar successes with this method will be had with modeling other building types, based on past literature. Ultimately, this method should offer another option for trained or untrained individuals working towards the measurement and publication of energy consumption for all buildings.

APPENDIX C5 ­ R SCRIPTS
This function is a wrapper for the VIF function in the fmsb package vif_func<-function(in_frame,thresh=10,trace=T){ require(fmsb) if(class(in_frame) != 'data.frame') in_frame<-data.frame(in_frame) vif_init<-NULL for(val in names(in_frame)){ form_in<-formula(paste(val,' ~ .')) vif_init<-rbind(vif_init,c(val,VIF(lm(form_in,data=in_frame)))) } vif_max<-max(as.numeric(vif_init[,2])) if(vif_max < thresh){ if(trace==T){ prmatrix(vif_init,collab=c('var','vif'),rowlab=rep('',nrow(vif_init)),quote=F) cat('\n') cat(paste('All variables have VIF < ', thresh,', max VIF ',round(vif_max,2), sep=''),'\n\n') } return(names(in_frame)) } else{ in_dat<-in_frame while(vif_max >= thresh){ vif_vals<-NULL for(val in names(in_dat)){ form_in<-formula(paste(val,' ~ .')) vif_add<-VIF(lm(form_in,data=in_dat)) vif_vals<-rbind(vif_vals,c(val,vif_add)) } max_row<-which(vif_vals[,2] == max(as.numeric(vif_vals[,2])))[1] vif_max<-as.numeric(vif_vals[max_row,2]) if(vif_max<thresh) break if(trace==T){ prmatrix(vif_vals,collab=c('var','vif'),rowlab=rep('',nrow(vif_vals)),quote=F)

cat('\n') cat('removed: ',vif_vals[max_row,1],vif_max,'\n\n') flush.console() } in_dat<-in_dat[,!names(in_dat) %in% vif_vals[max_row,1]] } return(names(in_dat)) } } lm.dat <- read.csv("2012I.csv", header=T, sep=",") form.in<-paste('ec2012 ~',paste(names(lm.dat)[-15],collapse='+')) mod1<-lm(form.in,data=lm.dat) summary(mod1) keep.dat<-vif_func(in_frame=as.matrix(lm.dat[-15]),thresh=5,trace=T) form.in<-paste('ec2012 ~',paste(keep.dat,collapse='+')) mod2<-lm(form.in,data=lm.dat) summary(mod2)

The Dredge script below shows the global model after collinear variables have been removed.
fit2 <- glm(ec2012 ~ c2 + c3 + c5 + c6 + c9 + c11 + c12 + factor(Footprint.Shape) + Above.Ground.Floors + Below.Ground.Floors + Shared.Wall) options(na.action = "na.fail") dredge(fit2, extra = c("adjR^2"))

Below is an example of the script used to carry out Leave-one-out Cross-validation. Notice that the global model is a more refined (i.e. less predictor variables) version of the one used in the Dredge script.
bestfit2c <- glm(ec2012 ~ c6 + c9 + Below.Ground.Floors) cv.glm(dfspace2, bestfit2c)$delta

GLOSSARY Akaike Information Criterion A metric used to guide model selection. In theory, the chosen model is often one that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between the model and the "truth". In practice, the criterion looks for models with a good fit with minimal number of parameters. A modified version of AIC applicable to small samples. An increased penalty for additional parameters is used. [73, 124] The relative likelihood of the model, given the data. Normalized to sum to 1 among candidate models. [73]

Akaike Weight

Causation

A cause and effect relationship between variables. Separate from correlation, causation among variables can only be inferred from a well design randomized controlled experiment. [125]

Coefficient of determination (R2)

A metric used to convey the goodness of fit for a model. For a regression, the values range from 0 to 1 and measure how close the data is to the fitted line. [126] A modified version of R2 that takes into account the number of predictor variables in the model. The value increases only when the additional variable(s) improves the model more than would be expected by chance. The adjusted R2 is always lower or equal to the R2 for that model. [127]

-

Adjusted R2

Coefficient of Variation

A measure of dispersion calculated by normalizing the standard deviation of a sample with its mean. [128]

Collinearity

An undesirable property among predictor variables where excessive correlation exists. This correlation has no negative impacts on the performance of the regression model but is problematic when the effects of individual predictor variables are of interest. [129]

Correlation

A function of the relationship between variables. [130]

171

-

Coefficient of Correlation

A measure of correlation that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. Values range from 1 (positive relationship) to -1 (negative relationship) with weaker relationships having a coefficient closer to 0. [130]

Cross Validation

A process that allows for model validation by splitting the data into a training set and testing set. [131] Data is randomly divided into k equal sized subsets. Cross validation is then run k number of rounds. During each round, 1 subset will be used for validations and the remaining ones, for training. Error is averaged over all rounds. [131] The process of calculating error is the same as k-fold. However, in this method, k = n (the number of data points in the entire sample). [132]

Degrees of Freedom (Residual)

A measure of certainty that the sample population is representative of the entire population. Degrees of freedom are a function of sample size and the number of independent variables. Each addition parameter included in the model reduces the degrees of freedom by 1. Generally, the more degrees of freedom a model has, the more accurately sampled the population is. [133, 134]

Freedman Paradox/model selection bias

Bias is introduced into the model when variables with a weak relationship to the response variable are selected as significant. Their selection is often a result of small effects being magnified within a particular dataset. A bias will always exists when selecting the "best" model from a large selection of models employing many predictor variables. The Freedman Paradox is the extreme case of this bias where predictor variables having no relationship to the response are included in the model thus spuriously inflating the R2. [83, 135]

Interquartile Range

A descriptive statistic that measures statistical dispersion in a dataset. Quartiles each represent 25% of the data; the range is the distance between the first and third quartile. [136]

Log Likelihood

A statistic used to measure how likely a particular population is to produce an observed sample. When used to compare models, the 172

value can be used to validate the plausibility of one model to that of another. [137]

Nominal Cost of Electricity

The value of the good or service at the time it was produced.

Principle of Parsimony

The ideal that a model should neither be under- nor over-fitted. The model should be as simple as possible with respect to the parameters, model structure, and number of variables. In practice, parsimony demands a tradeoff between bias/variance and the number of estimated variables in the model. [73]

Real Cost of Electricity

The nominal value adjusted for inflation. A positive inflation over time will result in a decrease in the real value if the nominal price remains the same. A measure of the difference between predicted values from a model and actual observed values (residuals). Calculated by taking the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviation, the RMSE is a good measure of accuracy. [138] A normalized RMSE to the mean of the observed value ­ often reported as a percentage.

Root Mean Square Error

-

Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error

Standard Deviation

A statistic measuring how far each value in the dataset is from the mean. The measure is expressed in the same units as the mean. [139, 140]

Variance

A statistic measuring how far each value in the dataset is from the mean. The measure is expressed in square units. [139, 140]
