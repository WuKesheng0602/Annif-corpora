Title of Article: Effects of the characteristics of teaching on the outcomes of heart failure patient education interventions: A systematic review

1

Abstract Background: Limited research has examined the specific approach, mode of delivery, and dose of educational interventions. Yet such knowledge is essential to develop effective heart failure educational interventions. Aims and Methods: The intent of this systematic review was to determine what approach, mode, and dose is most effective in producing changes in heart failure patient education. The sample included 69 studies involving 1865 study participants. Results: Findings indicate the most effective means for delivery heart failure patient education is through the individualization of content, the use of combined mediums for delivery, provision of education on a one-on-one basis, and in multiple sessions. Conclusion: These results highlight the need to redesign current heart failure patient education initiatives to enhance patient outcomes.

1. Introduction Heart failure affects 2 to 4 % of the population internationally (1). In 2005, 7.6 deaths directly linked to heart failure were reported annually across the globe. The incidence of heart failure is increasing annually (2). Currently, there are more than 5.7 million individuals who are diagnosed with heart failure on an annual basis. Of those diagnosed, approximately half will require aggressive treatment and frequent hospitalizations, especially in the end-stage of the disease process (3, 4). As the number of individuals affected with heart failure continues to spiral, there have been dramatic increases in its associated health care costs. Health care expenditures for the treatment of this illness continues to double annually for inpatient care (5). Heart failure patient education is an essential component of nursing care aimed at assisting patients diagnosed with heart failure to take care of themselves (6). The education provides patients with the information required to understand their condition; to prevent and manage symptoms; and to decrease hospital readmission and morbidity and mortality rates (6). Results of individual and meta-analytic studies supported the effectiveness of heart failure patient education in reducing costs as reflected in decreased hospital stays (7, 8, 9) and improving knowledge of self-care (10), self-care behaviour performance (11, 12), and symptom experience (13). While these findings demonstrated the effects of heart failure patient education on the intended outcomes, they fall short of elucidating the specific approach, mode of delivery, and dose of educational interventions

3

that are associated with desired outcomes. Knowledge of the most effective educational intervention with respect to approach, mode of delivery, and dose is required to guide nursing practice. Such knowledge will direct the design and implementation of education in day-to-day practice, in the most effective and efficient way (14). This systematic review was conducted to address the clinically relevant question: What approach, mode, and dose is most effective in producing changes in heart failure patient education?. The specific objectives were: 1) to describe the approach to education, mode of delivery, and dose used in providing heart failure patient education; and 2) to explore the extent to which variability in outcome achievement is associated with differences in the elements of educational interventions. The target population included adult patients diagnosed with heart failure. 2. Conceptual definition In this section, the variables of interest to the systematic review are defined at the conceptual level. These definitions guided the specification of criteria for selecting the studies and facilitated data extraction. They were derived from theories and models relevant to patient education and self-care. The variables are categorized into elements of heart failure educational interventions and outcomes of education. 2.1. Elements of heart failure educational interventions Heart failure patient education refers to the communication of information about the management of heart failure. The goals of heart failure patient education are to ensure that the individual has the appropriate knowledge required to perform self-care behaviours in the home environment; to reduce the occurrence of heart failure symptoms and complications; and to enhance recovery and overall quality of life (15). In general,

4

heart failure patient education covers topics related to: medication management, activity performance, nutrition, signs and symptoms of complications, and pain management (16, 17). The elements of heart failure educational interventions include the approach to education, mode of delivery, and dose. Conceptually, approach to education involves the general strategy for communicating the information to patients. Education can be given in two approaches: standardized and tailored or individualized. Standardized heart failure education encompasses the provision of information pertaining to a pre-selected set of topics determined by nurses to be of relevance to heart failure self-management. The nurse discusses all topics with the patient. Individualized heart failure education consists of providing information on topics selected by the patient. The nurse discusses the topics that patients deem to be relevant to their specific health situation (18). Mode of delivery encompasses the medium and format for giving heart failure patient education. Medium is the process through which education is delivered, and includes: 1) contact with the health care professional through face-to-face or phone interaction; 2) written resources available as brochure or pamphlet, or on-line; and 3) audio-visual materials in the form of audiotape or videotape (18). Format refers to how the education is offered, that is, oneon-one or group discussion (18). Dose is defined as the level at which an intervention is given (14). It is operationalized in terms of the number of sessions during which education is provided. 2.2. Outcomes of education Three outcomes of education are of interest to this systematic review: self-care knowledge, self-care behaviour, and symptom experience. These outcomes represent the

5

anticipated consequences of education as advanced in models of patient education (18) and self-care (19), and investigated in several studies (17, 20). Self-care knowledge is defined as a body of facts and principles that is learned through life experience, or is taught. Knowledge is enhanced through educational interventions, and is made visible immediately through cognitive indicators such as recall of information (18). Heart failure patient education focuses on self-care knowledge, which refers to information about the condition and its treatment and about strategies for managing the condition and preventing complications. Self-care knowledge is operationalized as the correct identification of self-care information pertaining to fluid and food intake, activity performance, management of drug therapies, and recognition and response to signs and symptoms indicative of heart failure complications. Self-care behaviours refer to the performance of self-care strategies to promote the management of heart failure (21). The self-care strategies include: management of fluid intake, nutrition and symptoms; engagement in personal hygiene and usual physical activity; taking medications as prescribed; and monitoring the development of and managing heart failure complications such as difficulty breathing and fluid overload. Symptoms are "subjective experiences reflecting changes in a person's biopsychosocial function, sensation, or cognition" (13). Symptoms that are commonly experienced during heart failure include pain, dizziness, difficulty breathing, nausea, edema, sleep disturbances, and mood alterations (13). Heart failure symptom experience is operationalized as the perceived severity of any of these subjective experiences. 3. Methods 3.1. Design

A systematic review of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of heart failure patient education was conducted to address the two objectives. The definitions of the variables of interest guided the specification of key terms used to search databases, the specification of criteria for selecting studies, and the extraction of pertinent data. Effect sizes were computed for each category of outcomes and when pertinent data were reported, and compared across elements of heart failure educational interventions. 3.2. Selection criteria Studies were included in the systematic review if they met the following selection criteria: 1) the sample represented adult ( 18 years) patients diagnoses with heart failure; 2) the educational intervention involved the provision of self-care information related to heart failure; 3) the outcomes assessed were related to self-care knowledge, self-care behaviour, and/or symptom experience; and 4) the study report was published in English between 1986 and 2008. Studies that used experimental or randomized clinical trial (RCT) and quasi-experimental designs involving two groups were included in the systematic review. Results of meta-analyses showed that the effect sizes of experimental and quasi-experimental studies are comparable (22). 3.3. Search strategies The search for relevant studies used the following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and HEALTH STAR. The keywords used in the search were: discharge plan, heart failure, heart failure management, education, teaching, heart failure education, and heart failure teaching. Searches were limited to adult population, English language, and 1986-2008 periods. Reference lists of studies retrieved were examined for additional studies that investigated heart failure

7

education. A total of 578 articles published between 1986 and 2008 were found to have addressed heart failure patient education . Of these, 509 articles were excluded because 1) the reported study evaluated psycho-educational heart failure interventions (12.8 %), or 2) described heart failure educational frameworks or policies guiding practice (87.2 %). A total of 69 studies met the selection criteria and were included in the systematic review (7-12, 15-17, 20, 23-83). 3.4. Data extraction Data were extracted on study characteristics, elements of educational intervention, and outcomes of education. The definitions presented earlier guided the development of a coding scheme to facilitate data extraction from each article and to assign numeric values to the extracted data. 3.4.1. Study characteristics The following information was gathered about each study: year of publication, country in which the study was done, study design (quasi-experimental and experimental), sample size (total, and for each study group), number and type of study groups (control or comparison and treatment or two treatment groups), and patient population included. These data were used for descriptive purposes. 3.4.2. Elements of educational intervention Approach to education was categorized as standardized or individualized. Information on approach to education was obtained from the sections describing the nature of the intervention and/or the procedure for delivering it. Interventions that consisted of handing patients written resources, having patients watch a videotape or listen to an audiotape, and discussing with patients, a pre-selected set of topics, were

8

categorized as standardized education. In these studies all patients reviewed the same content on heart failure self-care. Interventions that addressed individual patients' learning needs, either through discussion with health care professional or computerassisted instructions, were considered as individualized education. The medium for giving heart failure education was coded as face-to-face contact with health care professionals, phone contact with health care professional, distribution of written resources (such as brochure, pamphlet, booklet) for patients to review on their own, and combination of different media for giving education (such as phone contact with health care professional, and distribution of written resources). The format for delivering education was coded as 1) individual, involving one person at a time, on a one-to-one basis which could take place when interacting with the nurses, or when the patient reviews written and audio-visual materials, and 2) group, involving several persons interacting with the health care professional or watching a videotape. The dose was indicated by the total number of sessions for giving education and categorized into: one session versus two or more sessions. 3.4.3. Outcomes of education The specific outcomes of interest, that is, self-care knowledge, self-care behaviour, and symptom experience were assessed with self-report measures capturing 1) the percentage of correct responses to items inquiring about patients' understanding of heart failure and management, 2) performance of strategies in which patients are expected to engage in, and 3) perceived symptom severity, respectively. For each of these outcomes, the following data were extracted: 1) whether or not post-test comparisons

9

showed statistically significant differences between the study groups. These data were coded into 0 = no significant differences and 1 = significant differences 2) the mean and standard deviation reported for each study variable at the first post-test. These data were used to compute the post-test effect size for each outcome investigated in individual studies. 4. Data analysis Descriptive statistics were used to 1) delineate the characteristics of the studies included in this systematic review, 2) describe the characteristics of patients comprising the sample selected across studies, and 3) indicate elements of educational intervention frequently implemented across studies (objective 1). For the outcomes of interest, the effect size was computed by subtracting the mean of the control or comparison group from the mean of the experimental group and dividing the difference by the standard deviation of the comparison group (22). Due to the small number of studies that provided the data required to compute the effect size, it was not appropriate to use inferential statistics to explore differences in outcomes in relation to elements of educational interventions (objective 2). Therefore, results pertaining to objective 2 are presented in terms of the number of studies showing statistically significant between-group differences and the mean effect size on the respective outcomes. 5. Results 5.1. Study characteristics The 69 studies that met the inclusion criteria involved 1865 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States (77.2 %), Canada (4.5 %), United Kingdom (9.2 %), and Asia (9.1 %). More than half (68.2 %) of the studies used an experimental

10

design to evaluate the effectiveness of heart failure educational interventions, while 31.8 % of the studies used a quasi-experimental design. Most studies (90.9 %) contained one experimental and one control group, while the remainder of the studies used one treatment group. 5.2. Elements of educational interventions Table 1 presents descriptive statistics regarding the number of studies included according to intervention elements and outcomes. All reports that used standardized only (n = 45, 65.2 %), individualized only (n = 24, 34.8 %), and combined (standardized and individualized) (n = 8, 11.6 %) elements contained a usual care component that consisted of standardized teaching. A combined mode of delivery that included face-to-face contact with a health care professional, phone contact, and the distribution of written resources was used by 26 (37.7 %) studies. Delivery of educational interventions through face-toface contact with a health care professional was used by 37 (53.6 %) studies, while 43 (62.3 %) used written resources. All (100 %) studies were delivered on an individual basis. Twenty-eight (40.5 %) studies contained interventions that were provided in more than one session, while 41 (59.5 %). 5.3. Characteristics of the participants In 89.1 % of the studies, the sample consisted of patients  50 years and in 10.9 % of the studies, patients who were < 50 years comprised the sample. For 73.0 % of the studies, the sample was mainly males. In 94.5 % of the studies, the sample had less than or equal to high school education. 5.4. Outcome achievement relative to intervention elements

11

Table 2 presents statistics related to the number of studies that provided data necessary to compute post-test effect size and the mean (range) effect size for each outcome. The results are summarized for each educational intervention element. In regards to approach to education, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in post-test self-care knowledge were reported in 50 % of the studies involving individualized and 39.1 % involving standardized educational interventions. The mean effect size for self-care knowledge was larger for individualized than standardized education. When the outcome was self-care behaviour performance no studies using individualized teaching reported a significant difference in the study groups. Whereas half (50 %) of studies involving standardized teaching, a significant difference was found between the study groups relating to self-care behavior however the mean effect size was small. Finally, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in post-test symptom experience were reported in one of the two studies involving individualized and 100 % of the studies involving standardized educational interventions. The mean effect size for symptom experience was larger for individualized than standardized education. Relating to medium, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in post-test self-care knowledge were reported in 70 % of the studies involving the use of combined media and 51.8 % involving interventions delivered in writing. The mean effect size for the delivery of educational materials using combined media was larger than materials provided in writing. As well, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in the performance of post-test self-care behaviours were reported in all of the studies involving

12

the use of combined media and 25 % involving interventions delivered in writing. The mean effect size for the delivery of educational materials using combined media was larger than for materials provided in writing. Finally, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in post-test symptom experience were reported in 20 % of the studies involving the use of combined media with a moderate mean effect size. None of the studies using written material demonstrated differences in symptom experience between the groups. With regards to mode of delivery format, there were no studies that described group delivery of patient education information. Of studies using a one-on-one delivery format, 18 (48.6 %) reported a statistically significant difference between comparison and experimental group in post-test self-care knowledge and the mean effect size was moderate. As well, 6 (27.2 %) studies identified a statistically significant difference between comparison and experimental group in the performance of post-test self-care behaviours although the mean effect was small. Finally, 5 (50 %) studies reported a statistically significant difference between comparison and experimental groups on symptom experience with a moderate mean effect size for the delivery of educational materials on a one-to-one basis. A statistically significant difference between the comparison and experimental group in post-test self-care knowledge was reported in 62.5 % of the studies in which the education was delivered in more than one session and 50 % of the studies in which the education was provided in a single session. The mean effect size for self-care knowledge was larger for education delivered in more than one session than education provided in a single dose. Additionally, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in the performance of post-test self-care

13

behaviours were reported in all of the studies in which the education was delivered in more than one session and 47.0 % of the studies in which the education was provided in a single session. The mean effect size for the delivery of educational materials using combined media was larger than face-to-face contact with a health care professional. As well, statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental group in post-test symptom experience were reported in all of the studies involving the delivery of the intervention in more than one session and the mean effect size was moderate. No studies in which the education was delivered at one point in time reported statistically significant differences between the comparison and experimental groups. 6. Discussion The results of this systematic review showed larger effect sizes for heart failure patient education in which the content was individualized, and given using a combination of media on an individual basis, and in more than one session. These features of educational intervention were beneficial in that they produced moderate improvement in self-care knowledge and performance of self-care behaviour, and decline in the number of post-operative symptoms experienced. These findings are consistent with those of studies conducted by Guruge (1999) and Suls and Wan (1992) who examined preoperative patient education. Thus, the results reinforce theoretical assumptions (18) for the individualization of educational content, use of multiple means for delivering education, provision of education on an individual basis, and in multiple sessions. Furthermore, the use of multiple media is consistent with Suls and Wan's (1992) who found that education provided in both written and audiovisual format was most effective in producing changes in patient's knowledge and behaviour performance.

14

Examples of multiple media include: contact with a health care provider through face-toface or phone; written materials such as brochures and pamphlets; and audiovisual (e.g. watch a videotape or listen to audiotape) (18). It is also worth noting that group work was shown to be less effective in heart failure patients than one-on-one interaction, yet it is still the usual method of delivery (86). This could be due to health care institutions imposing a less resource intense option on practitioners. 7. Implications The findings suggest that nurses could reconsider the redesign of their education initiatives to include individualized educational interventions, use of multiple media, and the delivery of teaching on a one-on-one basis. That is the educational content could be individualized to reflect the learning needs of the individual at a particular point in time. The first step in the process of individualization involves the evaluation of learning needs and delivery of education should be provided in multiple doses over a period of time to enhance the patient's overall knowledge, performance of specific behaviours, and reduce symptoms experienced during the post-operative recovery period. Furthermore, nurses could begin to think about presenting their educational content using multiple modalities to enhance patients' knowledge and performance of behaviours post-operatively, as well to reduce symptoms experienced during the recovery period. Use of multiple modalities enhances the likelihood for retention, recall, and application (18). That is, the education could potentially be presented in written format in combination with audio and/or video accompaniment to further enhance knowledge, behaviour performance, and health related

15

outcomes. Finally, nurse, specifically unit managers, could begin to think about ways in which to promote the delivery of teaching in a one-on-one format.
