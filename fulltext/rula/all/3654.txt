Abstract

 
SurfacerunoffsourcecontrolsuchasLowImpactDevelopment(LID)techniquesarebeing used as retrofit options for older developed areas that lack available land to implement conventional practices such as stormwater management ponds. The complexity of the catchment area requires detailed distributed urban drainage models, which need high resolutionlandcoverinformation,toaccuratelyestimatethebenefitsthatLIDsprovide.This thesis explores the use of high resolution WorldView2 satellite image in urban drainage modelling. A proposed twostage image classification method achieved 83% in image classification accuracy. The classified image was then used to model streets, where the drainage is provided by curb and gutter, roadside ditches and LID. The developed urban drainage models gave comparable but mixed results for different drainage systems comparedtotheobservedrunoffdataandGeographicInformationSystem(GIS)developed models. This research findings provide guidance to modellers in developing detailed distributedurbandrainagemodels.

Introduction
 

1.1BackgroundandMotivation
Globally,theincreaseofpopulationandurbanizationleadstothegradualreplacementof naturally pervious areas with manmade impervious materials (Foley et al., 2005). Urbanizationreducestheamountofinfiltrationandevapotranspiration,andresultsinan increaseofstormwaterrunoff,downstreamflooding,erosionanddegradationofreceiving waterbodies(Hattetal.,2004).Tomitigatethenegativeeffectsofurbanization,therehas beenanincreasinginterestinstormwatersourcecontrolmeasuresinrecentyears.Source controls such as Low Impact Development (LID) techniques are potentially attractive as retrofitoptionsforolderdevelopedareasthatlackavailablelandtoimplementconventional measures such as stormwater management ponds. Some of the municipalities in Canada already have implemented different forms of LID with a goal of maintaining the pre development hydrologic conditions (Dietz, 2007). Examples of LID include porous pavements,bioretention,raingardens,greenroofsandbioswales.LIDmanagesstormwater asclosetoitssourceaspossiblebymodifyingsmallareaslocatedwithinthepublicrightof wayand/oronprivatepropertiesthroughoutthewatershed.Moreover,LIDscan1)create more aesthetically pleasing neighbourhoods, 2) decrease stormwater runoff by having a storage medium underneath, 3) improve groundwater recharges and evapotranspiration,

and 4) improve water quality since pollutants are removed as runoff passes through the filteringmedium. BeforeimplementinganyLIDprojects,runningasimulationmodelisawaytopredict thebenefitsthatLIDsmayprovide.Simulationresultsfromavalidatedmodelcouldbeused in making decision for LID techniques implementation in future developments instead of doing a costly longterm monitoring support analysis. Since the goal of LID projects is to mitigate the adverse hydrologic and water quality effects of urbanization, the LID performanceisassessedintermsoftheachievedreductioninrunoffvolumeandpeakflow rate,aswellaswaterbalancerestoration.ElliottandTrowsdale(2007)reviewedtheexisting stormwatermodels,andreportedStormWaterManagementModel(SWMM)asoneofthe applicablemodelstoassesstheLIDsperformance.SWMMiswidelyusedtodevelopdetailed modelsforplanninganddesigningpurpose.InSWMM,catchmentsarespatiallydistributed and overland flow can be routed between catchments. That is specifically beneficial to represent LIDs explicitly. By explicitly representing LID areas occupying 100% of a catchment, it makes easier for novice modellers to assign required hydrologic/hydraulic parameters. To represent spatially distributed catchments in detailed, fieldsurveying, GeographicInformationSystem(GIS)dataandremotesensingtechniquesareconsideredas viablesourcestoobtainlandcoverinformationindetail.

Satellite images capture the most recent information accuratelywithfrequentupdate.Thishasbeendemonstratedinitiallyoncoarseresolution imageriessincethelaunchoffirstsatellitesensor,Landsat,in1972.Withtheadvancement of satellite sensors, satellite derived topographic information is becoming more detailed, whereveryhighresolutionimagesprovideinformationinsubmetre.However,traditionally used pixelbased classification methods do not produce the detailed information at high accuracy.Therefore,differentclassificationmethodssuchasobjectbasedclassifiers,rule based classifiers etc., have been replacing pixelbased classification method in classifying veryhighresolutionsatelliteimages(Sugumaranetal.,2003;Walter,2004;Guoetal.,2007; Liuetal.,2008;Blaschke,2010). AsresourcesrequiredtocollectandupdateGISandremotesensingdatadiffer,three scenarios were presented by developing the following models in SWMM: 1) detailed distributed models using the information derived from satellite images and 2) detailed distributedmodelsusingsufficientGISdata.Incontrasttothedetaileddistributedmodels, thethirdscenario,3)lumpedmodelswerealsodevelopedtomakeamodelperformance comparisonbetweenlumpedanddetaileddistributedurbandrainagemodels.

The first one being the GIS land cover information from the City of Mississauga,whichwascollectedthroughRyersonUniversity'sLibrary.However,GISdata isnotalwaysavailableortheavailableGISdatamightbecollectedforotherpurposes;so, they are not readily available to develop SWMM. Therefore, an alternative approach to extractlandcoverinformationwasdemonstratedbyusingremotesensingdata,WorldView 2 image.

2.1StormwaterManagementPractices
Waterqualityandquantityissuesassociatedwithurbanizationhavebeenwelldocumented sincetheriseofurbanlandcover.Forexample,OwensandWalling(2002)reportedthat urbansourcesofpollutionandtotalphosphorouscontentdegradethewaterqualityatlakes or streams. The studies of White and Greer (2006) and Jacobson (2011) showed that decreases of natural pervious land covers (wetlands, forests) results in less groundwater rechargesandmorerunoff.WhiteandGreer(2006)studiedthestreamflowcharacteristics with reference to the land covers over the period of 1966 2000 using historic aerial photographs. They concluded that generation of runoff volume increases proportionally withtheincreasesofbuiltupareas,andhighfrequencyfloodsoccurrenceswiththegreater impervious areas. Such studies promoted stormwatermanagement practices to adaptfor ongoing needs since stormwater management has been focused to convey stormwater runoff offsite quickly using piped networks and endofpipe control at the outfall, historically.

Chapter 2. Literature Review   

Stormwater management practice has been evolved with the awareness of water quality issues in early 1990's. In Ontario, Canada, Ministries of Environment (MOE) and NaturalResources(NMR)mandatewaterqualitytoprotectandenhancesurfaceandground waterresources(MOEMNR,1991).Traditionallyusedcurbandguttercontrolsarebeing replacedbyditches,whichenhanceinfiltrationandrunoffquality,toachievewaterquality andquantitycontroltargets(Lietal.,1998;D'ArcyandFrost,2001).Endofpipecontrols such as dry ponds, wet ponds, infiltration drains etc., were constructed mostly in early 1990's.ThesecontrolsarecommonlytermedasurbanBestManagementPractices(BMPs). ThepurposesofBMPsare:todetainwaterduringthewetweathers,removepollutantsby settling,andsubsequentlyreleaserelativelycleanrainwatertotheoutlet(Montaltoetal., 2007;Davis,2008).  Researcherspredictthaturbanizationiscontinuetogrowoverthenext25years.It

is projected that already developed areas, for example California,are to increase by 98% (Alig et al., 2004). The shortage of available land in urban areas has restricted the implementation of BMPs. The regulatory requirements also pertain to treating the stormwater quality. For example, MOE (2003) requires that total suspended solid (TSS) loads be reduced 80% at the source by using green infrastructures, where the degree of subwatershed urbanization is high. Some practices of source control include downspouts disconnection, implementing LID, etc. Unlike traditional drainage systems, LID has the potentialtoaddresswaterqualityandquantityissueswithouttransferringproblemsfurther downstream.LIDsarebeingincorporatedwithagoalofmaintainingthepredevelopment hydrologicconditionsbyutilizinginfiltrationmethod(Dietz,2007).ExampleofLIDincludes porouspavements(Fig.21(a))andbioretention(Fig.21(b)).LIDsmanagerunoffvolume

Then, engineered soil consists of sand bed, organic layer etc., treats the runoffwhichgraduallyinfiltrates.ExistingstudiesreportedthatLIDsarethemosteffective retrofit strategyfor stormwater managementin urban areas (Rushton, 2001; Hood et al., 2007).  As the practices evolved from implementing endofpipe dry and wet ponds, infiltrationdrainsandswalestoclusteredLID,modellingscaleofurbandrainagemodelshas also been transformed from watershed level to small scale at lotlevel to predict the performanceofindividualstormwatercontrolsystems.
 

2.2Hydrologic/HydraulicModelling
Theimpactofimpervioussurfacesonthehydrologicalcycleiswellstudied,andtheRational method has been widely used to calculate peak runoff volume since the late 19th century (Cantersetal.,2011).TheRationalmethoddoesaccountfordifferenttypesoflandcover; however,thesimplifiedmethodhasalotoflimitationsincludingaconstantdistributionof rainfallandthecalculatedrunoffisdirectlyproportionaltotherainfall(Cantersetal.,2011). Inlargercatchments,thesesimple"linear"modelshavebeenshowntowork(Beven,2011). Inreality,hydrologicalprocessesarenonlinearandtheseparametersshouldnotbesimply averaged.Hence,spatialandtemporalresolutionwereconsideredinfurtherstudies. Research conducted by Wilson et al. (1979), Abbott et al. (1986) and Refsgaard (1997) also found that a variation of catchments' hydrologic response impacts on the simulationresultssuchasrunoffvolumeandpeakflowrateatawatershedlevel.Withthe increasing awareness of the problem of nonlinearity, a feasible disaggregation of the drainageareahasbeendonewiththedataandcomputationalresourcesavailableoverthe

last four decades (Canters et al., 2011). Therefore, study catchments have been disaggregatedintoindividualsubcatchmentsbasedonthespatialvariabilityinlandfeatures. Tofulfilltheneedsofspatiallyvaryingdatainaccuratedigitalrepresentations,GISwasused as a valuable tool to generate spatial information in hydrologic modelling (Pullar and Springer, 2000). The primary GIS data integrated in hydrologic modelling is the digital elevationmodel(DEM)todescribetopographyofcatchmentsinthelate1980s(Mooreetal., 1991;SuiandMaggio,1999).DependingonthegridsizeofDEM,earlyattemptsofspatially distributed models were mostly gridbased models (Montgomery and FoufoulaGeorgiou, 1993; Zhang and Montgomery, 1994; Turcotte et al., 2001). These studies developed processestodelineatecatchmentsandflowroutingtowardsthesteepestdirectionbasedon DEMatwatershedscale. Beven (2001) discussed the problem of uniqueness in defining catchments; he pointedoutthatamodelshouldaccounttheeffectsoflocalheterogeneity.Asmorethanone land cover types fall within a defined catchment area in gridbased models, hydrologic parameters were averaged. Therefore, it is useful to implicitly consider the effect of heterogeneity and nonlinearity of catchments characteristics. Hence, to address the uniquenessofthesubcatchment,homogeneousareamodelshavebeendisaggregatedbased onphysiographicandclimaticcharacteristics(AbidaandEllouze,2006).Inanefforttotake account of the specific characteristics of the subcatchment areas, the development of distributed homogeneousarea models have been studied extensively. However, such coarsescalehomogeneousareamodelsarestillnotappropriateforurbansettings,sincein anytypicalurbanareasitiscommontoseemanypatchesofheterogeneouslandcovertypes.

Chapter 2. Literature Review   

In the past, the impediment of developing detailed urban drainage model can be regarded by lacking the automatic data acquisition of high resolution data to feed in hydrologicmodelling(Bellaletal.,1996).Thatthuspavesawaytouseremotesensingdata to serve such needs. Since very high resolution satellite images capture smaller ground featuresaccurately,highresolutiondatatofeedinhydrologicmodellingcanbeproducedby executing image classification techniques on satellite images. With the cost of requiring detailed land cover information and computational power, more "realistic" models have beendevelopedthanever. 

2.3RemoteSensingforDrainageModelling
Remotely sensed earth observation data has been used widely in urban environmental studiesandsomeoftheapplicationsinclude:monitoringthebiophysicalenvironmentusing the digital change detection techniques (Coppin and Bauer, 1996); assessing urban heat island effect due to urban expansion (Weng, 2009); and land cover mapping to extract topographicinformation(Yangetal.,2003).  In particular for urban drainage modelling, satellite remote sensing has been

Thus, high resolutionsatellitedataarebeingacquiredtoserveinlandcoverclassification.Particularly inwaterqualityandquantitymodelling,someofthestudiesdemonstratedtheuseofremote sensingdatatoretrievelandcoverinformation.Forexample,Elgy(2001)usedairbornedata to classify land cover types which was aimed to be used in urban drainage modelling; Thanapura et al.

Hence, traditional pixelbased classification techniques,whichclassifytheimagebasedonpixelbypixel,maynotperformwellwithvery high resolution satellite imagery.

Having the extra four spectral bands (coastalblue,yellow,rededge,andnearinfrared2(NIR2))inadditiontothered,green, blueandNIRbandshavebroughtresearchers'attentiontoemployWorldView2imageryin a diversity of applications. Applications of WorldView2 imagery have been reported in mappingofurbantreespecies(PuandLandry,2012),forestbiomassandcarbonassessment (Eckert,2012),andestimationofmovingobjectsvelocity(Salehietal.,2012).Inspiteofthe abovementionedattemptsofusingWorldView2imagery,thereisalackofevaluationon how applicable it is to use the very high spatial resolution images in urban drainage modelling, particularly in assessing LID's performance. That thus motivates us to use WorldView2 imagery, and automate the process of retrieving land cover patterns to overcometheproblemoflandcovertypesunavailabilityeverywhere.

catchmentarea.Hence,somesubcatchmentparameters,suchasdepressionstorage,slope, width, etc., are estimated by the modeller and the models require calibration against monitoreddata. Detailed distributed models explicitly represent a catchment as being entirely occupiedbyaLID,whichallowalesssubjectivewaytoparameterizethemodels,leadingto performingamodelcalibrationbecomingdiscretionary.Eventhoughmanystudies(Paudel, 2010; Goldstein, 2011; Krebs et al., 2013; Alam, 2014) showed promising results from detaileddistributedmodels,atransitionfromlumpedmodelstodetaileddistributedmodels isnotfastmoving.Oneofthereasonscouldbeduetodataavailabilityofdetailedlandcover information since developing detailed distributed models requires the land cover information in fine resolution. Generally, land cover information is retrieved from field surveying, GIS and remote sensing data. The first two methods of data collection are not always feasible or accessible. Therefore, remote sensing data could be regarded as a potentialdatasourcethatcanbeutilizedinthedevelopmentofdetaileddistributedurban drainagemodels.Toovercometheusualshadowproblemsthatarepresentedinveryhigh resolution satellite images, an experimental image classification method needs to be examined for specific study areas. Therefore, in this thesis, objectbased classification method that incorporates brightness values, area values and topological rules will be examinedtoproducelandcoverlayers,whichwillsubsequentlybeusedinurbandrainage modelling. Then an urban drainage model developed by using the satellitederived informationshouldbevalidatedtoinvestigatehowfeasibleitistouseveryhighresolution satelliteimageinurbandrainagemodelling.

With reference to Rossman (2010), % Imperviousness, Manning's n, depression storage, %Zeroimpervparameterswereassignedaccordingly.Then,asetofruleswasdevelopedto identifyanoutletforeachsubcatchment.  UrbandrainagemodellingusingSWMM

The primary data requirement of urban drainage models, land cover information to parameterizespecificManning'snanddepressionstoragevalues,wascollectedfromtwo sources:GISdataandtheclassificationresultsoftheWorldView2images.Theotherdata requiredtoinputinSWMMinclude:1)soiltypetodeterminetheinfiltrationrate,2)average monthlyevapotranspirationrate,3)stormdrainageinfrastructureinformationthatconvey runoff, 4) digital elevation model (DEM) to identify the elevation values of all hydraulic elementsinSWMM,5)rainfalldatafortheperiodofanalyses,and6)monitoredrunoffdata tovalidatethemodelsperformance. With all these described data, two detailed distributed homogeneousarea models usinglandcoverinformationfromtwodifferentsources,butthesamemodelstructureand subcatchmentparameterization,weredevelopedtosimulatetherainfallÂ­runoffprocess. Using the GIS data, lumped models were also developed. This comparison was made to examinehowthelandcovervariation,asdeterminedfromthetwoapproaches,influences thehydrologicsimulationresults.

Imagepansharpeningisaprocessthatusesapanchromaticimagetosharpenmultispectral images. The pansharpened reaps the benefits of having high spectral resolution of its multispectralbands,aswellasfinespatialresolutionofitspanchromaticband. In2004,Zhangreviewedtheexistingmethodsofremotesensingimagefusion,such as Intensity, Hue and Saturation (IHS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Brovey transform, Waveletbased fusion, etc (Zhang, 2004). These methods may produce an unsatisfactoryresult,whichmaynotreflectthetruecolouroftheimagescene,particularly onveryhighresolutionsatelliteimagery.Subsequently,Padwicketal.(2010)proposedthe Hyperspherical Color Sharpening (HCS) method, which is a tailormade for WorldView2 imagery. This method was proven to outperform visually and quantitatively than all the othermethods. Hence,toachievethebestpossibleofspatialandspectralresolution,HCSmethodwas executedonWorldView2imageintheERDASIMAGINE2013.Byfusingthemultispectral bands (1.84 m spatial resolution) with the panchromatic band (0.46 m resolution), the resultant pansharpened image was produced with eight spectral bands at a halfmetre spatialresolutionimage.Fig41showsasmallsubsetofmultispectral,panchromaticand pansharpened images to illustrate the visual and quantitative enhancement of pansharpening.

SincetheoriginalandPCAderivedfeaturespacesmaynotbeabletodistinguishall land cover features with high accuracy, several studies included the correlations or quantificationbetweentheratioofthedifferenceofcertainbandstophysicalcharacteristics. Therefore, in order to aid in spectral analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIs)werealsogenerated.AsprecedentsensorsofWorldView2hasonlyfourcommon bands(i.e.red,green,blue,NIR),NDVIwasderivedbyusingtheredandNIRbands.However, WorldView2hasahighspectralresolution,itcomeswithtwoNIRbands(bands7and8), andtworedbands,namely,red(band5)andrededge(band6).Therefore,therearefour possible combinations to derive NDVI (Jawak and Luis, 2013; Belgiu et al., 2014). With reference to Fig. 48, the experimental testing revealed that the NDVI1 and NDVI3 outperformed than other possible combinations in separating the features in these study areas. Fig. 48 illustrates the statistics of the brightness values of vegetation and non vegetation land cover types. Brightness values at NDVI1 and NDVI3bands for vegetation wereabout0.4whilenonvegetationwereabout0.1;thatresulting0.3differencesbetween twofeatures.However,brightnessvaluesatNDVI2andNDVI4bandsforvegetationwere about0.05andnonvegetationwereabout0.05.Hence,NDVIsgeneratedbyEqs.4.1and4.2 weretakenintoaccountinfurtherimageprocessing.

4.5ObjectbasedImageClassificationMethod
Objectbasedimageclassificationmethodcomposesoftwomajorphases:segmentationand classification. Segmentation aims to group neighbouring pixels into "objects" at multiple scalelevels,wherethegroupedpixelsarerelativelyhomogeneousintermsofthebrightness valuesoftheimagebands(Blaschke,2010).Insecondpart,atwostageimageclassification methodwasdevelopedthatutilizesspatial,spectralandtopologicalinformation.

4.5.1Segmentation
The image was broken down into object segments using eCognition 8.1. The problems associatedwithsegmentationprocessareeithertheimagecouldbeoversegmented(when therealworldobjectissegmentedintosmallerobjects)orundersegmented(whenmore thanoneoftherealworldobjectsaremergedtogether).Thefirststageofobjectbasedimage classification, segmentation, significantly affects the classification result. Hence, several trialswereexecutedtoavoidoversegmentationorundersegmentation. Multiresolution segmentation was used to group homogeneous pixels with the followingsettingsintheeCognition8.1.Theadvantagesofmultiresolutionsegmentationis beingabletosegmentanimageinto"homogenousareastothedifferentscalesofinterest". Ingeneral,residentiallandcovertypesarecomposedofsmallheterogeneousregions;hence, scaleparameterwassetat20.Avisualinspectionofthesegmentedpolygonspointedout that there were still some of the objects being oversegmented. However, when scale parameter was increased over 20, many objects were undersegmented. Hence, scale parameter was set at 20, and the oversegmented will be rectified by spatial merging, combiningmorethanoneobjects,intheclassificationprocess.Then,segmentshomogeneity

Then,theweightofshape(intherangeof0.1Â­1)wassetas0.8.Anotherparameterwas defining the weight of bands to be used in segmentation.

Same structure of the decision tree was applied to both Image1 and Image2 with modification of decision rules. With reference to Fig. 411, at the point of differentiating between vegetation and nonvegetation, each polygon's brightness values of PCA2 and YellowbandswereexaminedasshowninFig.410.Ifthestatedconditionsweresatisfied, thepolygonwasclassifiedasvegetation;otherwise,itwasassignedintononvegetation.As noted earlier, due to the existence of a variety of roof colours, buildings were split into differentgroups.Attheendofthedecisiontree,theimageswereclassifiedintofourland covertypes:1)grass,2)tree,3)road,and4)building.Onceeachpolygonhadlandcover types assigned, spatial merging was carried out based on the classification result. This processwasappliedtorectifytheoversegmentedpolygonsiftheysharedtheedgesandhad the same classification result. Fig. 415 and Fig. 417 display the firststage classification resultsofImage1andImage2,respectively.  SecondStage:PostclassificationbasedonTopologicalRules

Land cover classification in urban areas hinders the process due to the existence of unexpectedobjects.Forexample,carseithermovingonroadsorparkingatdrivewayswere theproblematicinclassifyingthesecatchmentareas.Carshadasimilarreflectancerangeas rooftops; therefore, many polygons on roads (cars being on roads) were misclassified as buildings as shown in Fig. 414. For this reason, the topological rule, derived from a GIS parcelboundary,wasappliedtoenhancetheclassificationaccuracy.Thisparcelboundary restricted the polygons being classified as buildings if the polygons were located on the municipalrightofway(ROW).Firstly,bufferareaof0.001mforbuildingsontheROWwere generated.Then,inArcMap10.2,thecondition:100%ofBoundaryofBuildingintersected

5.1.2RoadsideDitchesSystem
LV2drainageareaspansovertwostreets:EastmountAvenueandFirstStreet.Eastmount AvenuehasroadsideditchesandFirstStreetisservicedbycurbandgutter.SWMMprovides two options for modelling of roadside ditches: as a conduit with defined crosssection propertiesandasanLIDvegetativeswalesasillustratedinFig.51.Inreality,runofffrom ditchesdrainsthroughculvertsthatexistbeneatheachdriveway.However,SWMMdoesnot supporttodischargerunofffromswales(catchment)toaninletofaculvertsystem(node). Therefore, outlet of swales was set to be downstream swales. This assumption was reasonable to make since the time taken for runoff to pass through a sevenmetrelong culvertsystemisextremelyshort.Besides,runoffneitherevapotranspiratesnorinfiltrates while passing through a culvert system. Therefore, this approach is expected to have negligibleeffectsonthemodelresultshydraulicallyorhydrologically.

5.2ParameterizingLumpedModels
Lumped models treat the whole drainage area as a single element; therefore, required parameterswereaveraged.Ashortcomingoflumpedmodelsisthattheirparametersdonot representthetruephysicalcharacteristicsofthecatchments(Reedetal.,2004).Table52 describes the parameters used in developing lumped models. To parameterize lumped models,themodifiedGISdatawasused.Sincealltheparametershavetobelumpedtogether, thefollowinglandcovertypes:road,driveway,sidewalk,buildingweresummeduptoget imperviousarea,andgrassandtreeareasweresummeduptogettheoverallperviousarea. Area represents the total area of the subcatchment in hectare. The overland flow lengthisthedistancefromthehydrologicallyfarthestpointtothecenterlineoftheroad. Therefore,thedistancefromthebackofalottotheroadcenterlinewasmeasuredinArcMap 10.2. As defined in the SWMM Application Manual by GironÃ¡s et al. (2009), width was estimatedbythesubcatchmentareadividedbytheaveragemaximumoverlandflowlength. Percent Imperviouswascalculatedbytakingtheratiooftotalimperviousareassuch as building, road, driveway, and sidewalk to the subcatchment total area. Buildings have sloped rooftops; therefore, area of building was considered as impervious area without depression storage. This value represents the % ZeroImperv, which is the percent of impervious area with no depression storage. Internal routing of runoff was described as runofffromrooftopsflowtofrontlawn;therefore,IMPERVwaschosenforsubarearouting. Then, percent routed determines the portion of runoff from impervious area that flowsovertheperviousareatothesubcatchmentoutlet.Incurbandguttersystem,onlynon RDCAflowontoperviousarea,whichisequaltobuildingareaslessRDCA.Eq.5.1describes

Similarly, when the available GIS data were combined, the GIS data have six different land cover types: 1) wooded area (tree), 2) building, 3) sidewalk, 4) road, 5) driveway,and6)grass.Asnotedearlier,sidewalk,drivewayandroadwerecombinedasone type in remote sensing data. Apart from this difference, data from both sources were processedinthesamewayintheforthcomingprocessesforallthreecatchmentareas.

Chapter 5.  Development of Urban Drainage Models   

To present the catchments in detail at the lotlevel, the catchments were first delineated using parcel boundary. That was a requisite step since as a part of image classification, polygons with the same classification result that share the boundary were mergedtogether.LikewiseinGISdata,treewasdenotedasalargepolygonthatspansover severallots.Secondly,grassordrivewaythatfalloutsideofprivatepropertiesweretreated asrightofwaygrass(ROWgrass)andrightofwaydriveway(ROWdriveway),respectively.

5.3.2SubcatchmentParameterization
5.3.2.1Parameterizinghydrologic/hydraulicparameters Afterthepolygonlayersrepresentinglandcoverinformationwasdisaggregatedas described in Sec.5.3.1, subcatchments were parameterized to prepare SWMM models. Physical characteristics of subcatchment such as x,ycoordinates and area values were obtainedinArcMap.Incontrast,thehydrologicandhydraulicparameterswereassignedon the basis of land cover type. Each land cover type had a unique hydrologic response; therefore, with reference to Rossman (2010), the following values were assigned for % imperviousness,Manning'snvalue,depressionstorage(Dstore)and%zeroimperviousas showninTable.5.3. Table53Hydrologic/HydraulicParametersAssignedforEachLandCoverType Hydrologic/hydraulicparameters Landcovertype %Imperv Tree Building Sidewalk Road Driveway Grass  The percent imperviousness describes the percentage of impervious area of a subcatchment.Assubcatchmentsweredisaggregatedtoincludeonlyonelandcovertype,

Manning's n value refers to the roughness coefficient used to determine the flow velocity,overthatcertainlandcovertype.Thedepressionstoragevaluereferstothedepth ofrainfallthatfillssurfacedepressions.Withtheassumptionthatbuildingmayhaveasloped rooftopof33%,nodepressionstoragewasspecifiedforbuildings.Ontheotherhand,road, sidewalk and driveway may have ponding surfaces after being used for some years; therefore,1.778mmwasassigned.Thelastcolumn,%ZeroImpervrepresentsthepercent ofimperviousareawithnodepressionstorage.Onlybuildingswereconsideredastheland covertypewithoutdepressionstorage;hence,100%wasassignedforbuildingand0%for the remaining types. This process demonstrates that it is easier to parameterize detailed distributed models compare to lumped models as the assigned parameters are more reasonableforhomogeneoussurfaceswithouttheneedforaveraging. Theremainingtwoparameters,outletandwidth,thatarerequiredinSWMMinvolved GISprocessingtogetroughestimates.SinceSWMMallowsrunofftoberoutedasoverland flow between catchments in single flow direction, an outlet for each microsubcatchment wasidentifiedasdescribedinSec.5.3.2.2. 5.3.2.2 IdentifyinganOutlet   SeveralalgorithmsbasedonrasterDEMtodeterminetheflowpathhavebeenused inhydrologic/hydraulicmodelling.Atawatershedlevel,DEMiscommonlyusedtodelineate thedrainageareas,forexample,asconductedbyLucianietal.(2011).ArcGISbasedsystem, ArcHydro,offersthetoolstoprocessthewatershedleveldelineationbasedontheDEM.In 1984, O'Callaghan and Mark introduced the earliest and simplest method called deterministiceightneighbour(D8).
78   

Chapter 5.  Development of Urban Drainage Models   

In D8 algorithm, 3Ã3 window of grids were examined to specify one of the eight neighbours that has the steepest downward slope. If all eight neighbours have the same slope,3Ã3windowofgridsisexpandedto5Ã5windowofgrids.Attheend,theflowdirection willalwaysberoundedtothenearest45degrees.Thisimprecisionmaynotbeanissuein modellingatawatershedlevel.However,indetaileddistributedmodelsofheterogeneous urbanareas(withirregularlyshaped,smallsubcatchmentswithabruptslopechangesand engineereddrainagesystems)usingremotesensingdataraisessomeissues.Moreover,the D8algorithmheavilydependsonthequalityofDEM;therefore,thehorizontalaccuracyof DEMshouldbeasfineastheresolutionofhydrologicmodel.Forthiscasestudy,DEMasfine asmicrosubcatchmentresolution,wasnotavailable.TheavailableDEMasdepictedinFig. 38wasnotsuitabletoutilizeinflowroutingduetoitscoarseresolution.Forthesereasons outletswereidentifiedbasedontheassumptionthatalltheoverlandflowpathsdirected weretowardsthestreet(i.e.roadcatchbasinsandsubsequentlythestormsewer),following thestandardengineeringpracticeforgradingofdevelopedland.AsopposedtotheArcHydro tool,thismethodologyidentifiedtheoutletfirst,thentheoverlandflowpathwascalculated basedonthedistancebetweenthecatchmentanditsoutlet.Fig.57illustratestheflowchart to identify the outlet.

This output layer (Bearing Intersected Catchments) consistedoftheIDsofsubcatchmentsthatwherethelinepassesthroughuntilitreachesthe STMMain. Meanwhile, using the Polygon Neighbors function, surrounding polygons of each catchment were identified. The output table was compared with the Bearing Intersected CatchmentstableusingaVisualBasicforApplications(VBA)scripttosearchacommonID between two tables. If there was only one common ID between these two tables, that common ID was the outlet of the catchment. If there were more than one catchments, distance value of each ID were compared, and the ID that had the longest distance was chosenastheoutlet.Byselectingthecatchmentthathadthelongestdistance,itisensured that the runoff was routed to the closest catchment, although, all the catchments were sharingtheboundary.Elevationwasalsotakenintoaccountinthiscasebycheckingwhether theidentifiedoutletwasbuildingornot.Inthecaseoftheoutletbeingabuildingpolygon, theoutletwasmodifiedtothesameoutletasthatdeterminedforthebuilding.Amanual interventionwasnecessarytomakeamodificationdependingonthedrainagesystemand thecatchmentmorphologyasintroducedinSec.5.1.

Since the LIDs on the LV4 site capturedalloftherunoffgeneratedduringsmallrainfallevents,onlysixoftheeventshad theobservedflowthatcouldbeusedformodelevaluations,asshowninFig.511.

Water balance pie chart is useful to analyze the percent of runoff, infiltration and evapotranspirationoccurringatthecatchment.Todisregardthecontinuityerrorduetoa coarsetimestep,summationofrunoff,infiltrationandevapotranspirationwasusedasabase value,insteadofprecipitation.AsLIDareapromotesinfiltrationandevapotranspiration,in mostofthesmallrainfallevents,100%ofrunoffwascapturedbyaseriesofbioretention andporouspavement.DuringtheperiodofFebruary2013toDecember2013,therewere 117 events, and all of the events were considered in order to analyze the water balance restorationafterimplementingLID. WithreferencetoTable59,theobserveddataindicatedthatrunoffconstituted19%, 14%and15%ofthetotalrainfallincurb&guttersystem,curb&gutterandroadsideditches system,andLIDsystem,respectively.Thisindicatesthatroadsideditchesgeneratedless runoffcomparedtoLIDsystem,leadingtoaquestionofthecredibilityofobserveddataat theroadsideditchessiteinparticular.Thiscouldbeduetothefactthatculvertsystemmight beblockedwithdebrisandpondingwateratroadsideditchesthatisthenprovidedgreater opportunitytoinfiltrateand/orevapotranspire,comparedtoanewlyconstructedsystem thatiscapableofconveyingtheflowsmoreefficientlytothemonitoringstation.Ifthatwas the case, observed data could not capture accurate runoff volume in such situation; therefore,simulatedresultshadhighersurfacerunoffpercentagecomparedtotheobserved datainLV2.InLIDsites,theobserveddatahas15%runoff,whereas,thesimulatedDetailed Â­GISandRSdatagave19%and18%,respectively.Thiscanbeexplainedbythelimitation ofSWMMasdiscussedinSection5.1.3.

5.6Summary
This chapter demonstrated the development of detailed distributed and lumped urban drainagemodelsof1)curbandgutter,2)roadsideditches,and3)LIDs(bioretentionand porouspavement)inSWMM.Landcoverinformationwasretrievedfromtwosources:GIS dataandtheclassifiedimagefromthetwostageclassificationmethodpresentedinChapter 4.Therequiredhydrologic/hydraulicandphysicalparametersofeachsubcatchment,such as area, width, overland flow path, % imperviousness, Manning's n value and depression storage value were determined using procedures developed in ArcMap 10.2. The performance of the detailed models utilizingWorldView2 image was compared with the modelsthatreplicatedthemodel structuresandconnectivitybetweensubcatchment,but using the GIS data and lumped models. All of the developed models were then compared againsttheobservedflowdata. The comparison of the simulation results between lumped models and detailed distributedhomogeneousareamodelsusingGISdatahighlightedwhichapproach(lumped vs detailed) to model study catchment areas. The important thing to note is the spatial resolution of rain gauges. Rain gauge located within 1km from the study sites introduce uncertaintiesinrainfall,whichisthemaindrivenfactorofrunoffgeneration.FaurÃ¨setal., (1995)suggestedthataverysmallcatchmentlessthanfivehashouldhaveonsiteraingauge at a temporal resolution of 5minute. After analyzing peak flow rate, total runoff volume, waterbalanceandflowdurationcurveforthreedifferentdrainagesystems,mixedresults were observed with respect to different models' ability to simulate runoff closest to the observeddata.

In this regard, the measurement uncertainty of observed data was not taken into accountwhencomparingthesimulatedandobserveddata;although,measurementerrors couldexistinthemonitoreddata.Forexample,deterioratedroadsideditchesallowrunoff tobeponded,evapotranspiratedandinfiltratedatanintermediatearea,insteadofconveying runoffunrestrictedlytotheoutlet.Inthissituation,observedrunoffvolumeatanoutletdid notreflectthetotalrunoffvolumegeneratedfromastudydrainagearea.Thisisconsistent withtheresultsshowninTable58,wheretheobservedrunoffvolumeislessthansimulated results. A comparison of the simulation results between two detailed distributed models showedtheimpactofavariationoflanduseinformationfromtwosourcesofdataonthe performance of urban drainage models. As discussed earlier, image classification results overestimated the impervious areas; therefore, the net results of the model with remote sensingdataindicatedhigherrunoffvolumeandpeakflowratethanGISdata,asexpected. Thisresultsprovidedabetterunderstandingofimperviouslandcovercontributioninurban settingstohydrologic/hydraulicsystem. The intent of this study was accomplished by demonstrating a way to develop detailed distributed (up to date) models assuming little to no GIS data available. This modelling approach would assist the modellers in the development and application of uncalibrated models, particularly useful in retrofit situations, where monitored data is unavailable or green field developments, where it is unable to collect such data.

Chapter 6
ConclusionsandRecommendations 6.1Summary
StormwaterissuesareincreasinglybeingsolvedbyimplementingLIDsinurbanareas,which in turn requires detailed distributed urban drainage models to accurately estimate the benefits of LIDs. The benefits of detailed drainage models were discussed in Chapter 2, including more realistic parameterizing that is less reliant on modellers' experience, accessing the performance of individual BMPs, LIDs etc., along with the cost of requiring detailed land cover information and complex models. Chapter 3 demonstrated the work methodology used to develop an image classification approach for WorldView2 satellite image. This chapter introduced the key data used and parameters extracted for the hydrological modelling. Chapter 4 demonstrated process and the results of the twostage image classification method that improved the classification accuracy, which dealt with shadow problems and existence of unexpected objects within the study areas. Chapter 5 utilizedtheimageclassificationresultsfromChapter4,GISdatafromtheCityofMississauga and,monitoredrainfallandrunoffdatafromCVCtomodelthreetypesofdrainagesystems: 1) curb and gutter, 2) roadside ditches, and 3) LIDs (a series of porous pavement and

6.2Accomplishments
Themainaccomplishmentofthisthesiscomesfromintegratingtheprocessingofremote sensing data and applying the processed data in detailed urban drainage modellings, an application that is hardly found in the image classification studies. The advanced image analysismethodshavebeenwellestablishedsincehighresolutionimageryhasbloomedin the1990's.Whilekeepingtheobjectivesofthestudyinmind,imageanalysisisconducted on the available data type. Number of research works have addressed the extraction of impervioussurfacesintheurbanareasusingsatelliteimages.However,previousworkhas beenconducteddifferentlybymanyresearchers,butnotwiththeresolutionofdataandthe modellingapproachpresentedhere. Thetwostageimageclassificationmethodwasdeveloped:thisclassificationmethod wasdemonstratedonWorldView2imagethatcoversaresidentialarea.Thefirststageof thetwostageimageclassificationmethodusedbothspectralreflectancevaluesandobjects' area to segment and classify the image of an old residential neighbourhood into four differentlandcoverclasses:1)grass,2)tree,3)road,and4)building.Then,inthesecond stage,postclassificationwasconductedbyimposingthetopologicalrulestofurtherimprove the classification accuracy. Combining the spectral, size and topological information increasedtheoverallaccuracyto80%and83%from64%and73%accuracyusingpixel basedclassificationtechnique.Theoverallaccuracyofthetwostageclassificationmethod demonstrated a great improvement over a traditional pixelbased classification method.

Chapter 6. Conclusions and Recommendations   

WiththeaidofauxiliarybandssuchasNDVIs,PCAandSUMbands,thisproposedmethod improved the image accuracy by 16% and 10% for two different areas, compared to a traditionalpixelbasedclassificationmethod.Thisclassificationmethodresultsresolveda challenging issue of inputting detailed land cover information in hydrologic/hydraulic modelling. Detaileddistributedurbandrainagemodelsweredevelopedinthisresearchwork. Thesedetailedmodelsbringadvantagesoverlumpedmodels,suchasbeingabletoidentify local flooding and, evaluate performance of individual LIDs etc. By disaggregating catchments into homogeneous area, everynatural hydrologic/hydraulic components (e.g: roadside ditches, LIDs) effects were being considered while these effects might be suppressed in lumped models. On the one hand, fine resolution of catchments make the modelsmorecomplexandrequiresmoredevelopmenteffortifoverlandflowroutinghasto bedonemanually.Hence,anapproachtoidentifyoutletsautomaticallyforeachcatchment atlotlevelwaspresentedusingArcMap10.2.

Thecredibilityoftheobserveddatashouldbeincreasedinordertoconfidentlyuse theobserveddatainvalidatingthedevelopedmodelsperformance.Withthemore accurateobserveddata,ameaningfulcomparisoncanbemadebetweentheobserved dataandthesimulatedresultsfromdevelopedmodels.



This research and similar studies (FaurÃ¨s et al., 1995; Beven, 2001; Gilroy and McCuen,2009;GhoshandHellweger,2011)recommendtouseanonsiteraingauge especiallyforaverysmallcatchment(lessthan5ha).Abetterdelineationofdrainage areaisassociatedwithalotofcosts,forinstance:detailedlandcoverinformation,a complexmodelthatrequiresoutletstobedefinedformicrosubcatchments,etc.Itis meaningful to develop detailed distributed models only if observed data is well representative of site conditions, and the purpose of the study indeed requires detailedmodels.Forexample,detailedmodelswouldbemorevaluabletobeusedin designingLIDsthananalyzingurbandrainagesystems.



Further studies should consider modelling water quality as well since CVC has collected water quality sampling. With the awareness of water quality issues, the evaluationofLIDsperformanceshouldalsoconsistofwaterqualityaspects.



Utilizationofremotesensingdatawouldbemoreattractivetoalargescaleprojects, where onscreen digitization and field surveying are not practical approaches.
