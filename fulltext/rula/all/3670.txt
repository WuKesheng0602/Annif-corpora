ABSTRACT      Blair  Williams,  2015.  Assessment  of  Load  Bearing  Clay  Brick  Masonry  for  Analyzing  Long- Term  Durability  Through  Field  Measurement  and  Visual  Review.  A  thesis  presented  to   Ryerson  University  in  partial  fulfillment  of  the  requirements  for  the  degree  of  Master  of   Applied  Science  in  the  Program  of  Building  Science.      This  thesis  examines  a  load  bearing  clay  brick  century  home  research  house  in  Toronto   (Canada)  which  has  recently  undergone  the  addition  of  polyurethane  foam  insulation  on  all   interior  sides  of  the  exterior  clay  brick  load  bearing  walls,  increasing  the  insulating  value  in   areas  to  RSI  7.9  W/m2K,  on  average.     This  study  introduces  and  advances  techniques  to  create  high-resolution  stitched  mosaic   images  of  the  elevations  to  visually  document  the  current  physical  condition  of  the  brick.   The  critical  saturation  point  was  used  to  determine  the  capabilities  of  the  clay  brick   masonry  to  resist  freeze-thaw  damage  by  way  of  frost  dilatometry  testing,  and  compared  to   measurements  taken  by  in-situ  moisture  content  sensors  in  the  brick  masonry.  This  project   also  reveals  how  bricks  expand  and  deteriorate  in  a  non-uniform  manner  during  saturated   three-dimensional  dilatometry  testing.

   1.  INTRODUCTION      With  energy  costs  on  the  rise  there  is  great  emphasis  being  placed  on  having  a  well  insulated   home.  New  houses  are  insulated  by  a  number  of  different  materials,  and  the  insulation  is   generally  installed  as  a  component  of  an  overall  wall  assembly  that  is  designed  in  a  way  that   minimizes  the  potential  for  premature  deterioration  of  the  building  envelope.        There  exists  a  great  number  of  pre-World  War  II  homes  constructed  of  clay  brick  masonry  in   Canada  that  have  minimal  insulation  installed,  if  any  (CMHC,  2004).  It  makes  sense  that   owners  would  want  to  insulate  these  older  homes  in  order  to  save  money  on  heating  and   cooling  costs;  the  instances  of  homeowners  installing  insulation  will  increase  as  energy  costs   rise  with  time.  Unfortunately,  altering  the  envelope  system  can  have  a  negative  effect  on  its   moisture  and  temperature  balance  (Straube  &  Schumacher,  2007).  Old  solid  clay  brick   masonry  walls  that  were  completely  uninsulated  would  dry  themselves  out  throughout  the   year,  simply  by  the  heat  loss  from  the  interior  heat  migrating  through  the  clay  brick  masonry   during  the  heating  season  (Straube  &  Schumacher,  2007).  Literature  exists  suggesting  harmful   effects  result  from  installing  closed-cell  spray-applied  polyurethane  foam  (SPF)  applications   on  the  interior  of  solid  clay  brick  masonry  in  order  to  achieve  modern  insulating  levels  (e.g.   approximately  RSI  3.5  W/m2K  to  7.9  W/m2K)  (Finch,  Straube,  &  Richmond,  2007;  Straube,   Schumacher,  &  Mensinga,  2010;  Straube,  Ueno,  &  Schumacher,  2011).  However,  little  is  known   about  the  effects  of  super-insulating  with  SPF  on  the  interior  of  load  bearing  clay  brick   masonry  to  increase  thermal  resistances  beyond  modern  levels  (i.e.  above  RSI  3.5  W/m2K).        1  

   This  research  project  focuses  on  quantifying  the  effects  of  super-insulating  clay  brick  masonry   from  the  interior  at  a  solid  clay  brick  masonry  case  study  research  house  in  the  Riverdale  area   of  Toronto  (Canada).  This  particular  research  house  is  a  three-storey  century  home,  of  which   the  bottom  two  storeys  are  constructed  of  load  bearing  double-wythe  clay  brick  masonry  and   is  currently  home  to  various  building  science  research  initiatives  (Richman,  2009).  The  house   has  recently  undergone  major  renovations:  the  interior  was  fully  demolished  to  the  clay  brick   walls  during  this  "full  gut"  renovation.  The  original  solid  clay  brick  masonry  walls  were  framed   on  the  interior  and  insulated  with  125  mm  to  175  mm  (5"  to  7")  of  900  g  (2-lb)  closed  cell   spray  applied  polyurethane  foam.  As  part  of  this  thesis,  temperature,  relative  humidity  and   embedded  moisture  content  sensors  were  installed  at  various  locations  throughout  the   exterior  walls,  and  the  in-situ  hygrothermal  regime  were  recorded  through  a  2  year  period;   data  over  the  winter  of  2012  was  focussed  upon,  as  all  sensors  were  simultaneously   operational  during  this  period.  Sample  clay  bricks  were  removed  from  the  walls  of  the  house   and  analysed  in  a  laboratory  using  standard  techniques  and  also  advancing  novel  techniques  to   obtain  essential  material  characteristics  that  could  be  used  to  create  a  highly  tuned  computer   model  of  the  wall  assembly  using  WUFI.

2.1  CLAY  BRICK  IN  TORONTO      In  the  1870's  an  industrious  paper  mill  owner  discovered  that  the  clay  along  Toronto's  Don   River  was  ideal  for  making  clay  bricks.  A  clay  brick  manufacturing  operation  started  shortly   thereafter.  Toronto  had  a  number  of  early  clay  brick  manufacturers:  "Robert  Goodings'  Brick   Works"  at  Broadview  Avenue  and  Bloor  Street  began  its  operations  around  1872  (City  of   Toronto,  2011b).  "James  Pears  Brick  Manufacturer"  (also  run  under  different  names)  on   Eglinton  Avenue  operated  from  about  1880  to  1923  (City  of  Toronto,  2011a).  And  most   notably  due  to  its  longevity,  the  Don  Valley  Brick  Works  operated  in  the  Don  lands  along   Bayview  Avenue  from  1889  to  1984  (Evergreen  Brick  Works,  2013).      Toronto  experienced  its  Great  Fire  in  1904  (City  of  Toronto,  2011).  At  the  time,  much  of  the   city's  downtown  was  constructed  of  a  mix  of  wooden  timber  frame  and  masonry  buildings.   They  were  built  closely  together,  so  the  flames  spread  quite  easily.  The  result  of  the  fire  were   new  city  by-laws  which  required  most  buildings  to  be  constructed  of  masonry  to  reduce  the   chance  of  fire  spreading  beyond  a  single  building  (Evergreen  Brick  Works,  2011).  With  at  least   three  significant  clay  brick  suppliers  in  the  immediate  area,  the  majority  of  residents  would   have  used  locally  manufactured  materials  to  construct  their  homes  rather  than  pay  premiums   to  import  clay  brick  by  rail  from  outlying  areas.

   Clay  brick  units  produced  at  the  turn  of  the  century  have  very  different  characteristics   compared  to  clay  bricks  that  are  produced  today.  Clay  brick  produced  up  until  the  middle  of   the  20th  century  was  highly  variable  in  dimension,  hardness  and  strength.  This  was  primarily   due  to  the  clay  type,  and  the  type  of  kiln  processes  used  to  fire  the  older  brick  (Laefer,  Boggs,  &   Cooper,  2004).  There  was  so  much  variability  of  quality  from  a  single  kiln,  that  clay  brick   manufacturers  would  classify  the  clay  brick  into  different  grades:  best  class,  first  class,  second   class  and  third  class.  Clinkers  (over-fired  clay  brick)  and  salmons  (under-fired  clay  brick)  were   also  sold,  but  not  for  structural  purposes  (Laefer  et  al.,  2004).        At  the  time,  there  were  no  standards  for  measuring  the  strength  of  these  clay  bricks,  but   generally  were  measured  by  their  compressive  strength  (Laefer  et  al.,  2004).  Today's  ASTM   standard  C62-11  classifies  clay  brick  into  three  general  grades:  Severe  weathering,  moderate   weathering,  and  negligible  weathering  clay  brick  (American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials,   2010).  The  Canadian  equivalent  to  this  standard  classifies  clay  brick  into  two  general  grades:   interior  grade  and  exterior  grade  (CSA  Standards,  2007).  The  testing  processes  used  to   develop  these  classifications  analyze  the  performance  characteristics  of  the  clay  brick,   including  compressive  strength,  water  absorption  and  saturation  limits,  and  also  irreversible   dimensional  change  as  a  result  of  freeze-thaw  damage  (Laefer  et  al.,  2004).  According  to  the   CSA,  all  clay  brick  used  for  exposed  application  in  Canada  must  be  severe  weathering  (CSA   Standards,  2007).      The  kiln  type  and  firing  process  play  an  important  role  in  determining  the  final  qualities  of  clay   brick.  The  clay  brick  in  Toronto's  historic  buildings  would  have  been  fired  in  traditional   4  

   "stationary"  type  kilns.  Batches  of  clay  bricks  were  placed  inside  the  kiln,  and  would  not  move   inside  the  vessel  during  their  firing  process.  The  fuel  (wood  or  coal)  had  to  be  attended  to  by   men,  and  was  heated  only  to  about  540Â°C.  "Non-stationary"  (or  "Tunnel")  kilns  were  invented   in  the  1700s,  but  were  not  well  developed  until  the  early  to  mid  twentieth  century.  In  these   types  of  kilns  the  clay  bricks  are  rolled  successively  between  preheating,  heating  and  cooling   stages.  The  fuel  for  these  more  modern  kiln  type  is  typically  gas,  oil  or  electricity,  and  with  the   assistance  of  computers  and  blowers,  the  temperatures  are  consistently  and  uniformly   maintained  up  to  1090Â°C  during  the  firing  process,  which  ensure  much  less  variability  in  the   quality  of  the  clay  brick  exiting  the  firing  process  (Laefer  et  al.,  2004).      Most  historic  clay  brick  masonry  typically  cannot  meet  today's  freeze-thaw  test  requirements   (Straube  et  al.,  2010).  Historic  buildings  were  constructed  of  clay  brick  that  was  manufactured   well  before  the  creation  of  ASTM  or  CSA  standards.  The  only  real  measure  of  durability  for  old   clay  brick  has  been  the  test  of  time:  clay  bricks  used  that  had  inferior  freeze-thaw  capabilities   have  simply  not  survived.  If  a  clay  brick  wall  assembly  degraded  relatively  soon  after   construction,  the  building  would  have  likely  been  demolished  decades  ago.  Any  historic  brick   buildings  that  remain  today  are  of  the  highest  quality,  and  have  survived  due  to  their  tolerant   characteristics,  and  are  also  aided  by  the  inefficiency  of  old  wall  assemblies  that  kept  them   warm  and  dry  in  the  winter.   Although  Toronto  and  other  cities  are  seeing  drastic  changes  in  their  skylines,  there  still  exist  a   tremendous  number  of  these  historic  clay  brick  buildings  in  many  neighbourhoods  in  and   around  the  city.  Structurally  speaking,  these  longstanding  buildings  are  very  different  than   ones  built  today;  the  clay  brick  masonry  walls  in  buildings  constructed  at  this  time  served  as   5  

   both  the  barrier  to  the  elements,  and  also  as  the  load  bearing  structure  for  the  floors  and  roof.   The  clay  brick  masonry  walls  typically  ranged  from  two  to  five  wythes  thick;  the  great  volume   of  brick  of  which  these  walls  massive  walls  were  comprised  was  capable  of  holding  a  greater   amount  of  moisture  simply  due  to  their  thickness.  Rain  events  and  surface  condensation   combined  with  capillary  moisture  transport  and  the  assistance  of  the  sun-driven  moisture   phenomenon  would  cause  moisture  to  travel  toward  the  interior  side  of  these  massive  walls.        Contemporary  buildings  use  a  completely  different  technique:  clay  brick  veneer  cavity  walls   are  only  a  single  wythe  deep,  and  hang  from  the  structure  of  the  building.  They  serve  to   impede  rainwater  entering  the  wall,  and  also  offer  a  "traditional"  aesthetic  appearance.  A   cavity  exists  behind  the  brick  veneer  to  serve  as  a  capillary  break  between  the  clay  brick  rain   screen  and  the  backup  wall;  the  cavity  serves  as  a  water  drainage  plane  as  well  as  a  vented   space  to  promote  drying  on  the  interior  side  of  the  brick.  Furthermore,  the  characteristics  of   the  clay  brick  have  changed  over  the  years.  Today  clay  bricks  used  for  exterior  purposes  in   Canada  and  northern  U.S.  must  be  certified  to  CSA  "Exterior  grade"  and  ASTM  specification   "Severe  Weathering"  respectively,  in  an  attempt  to  control  freeze-thaw  damage  in  buildings.        Different  building  practices  existed  at  the  turn  of  the  century  compared  to  the  practices  of   today.  There  was  less  of  a  concern  for  energy  efficiency,  and  as  such,  the  installation  of   insulation  did  not  exist  in  the  same  sense  as  it  does  today.  This  lack  of  concern  for  energy   efficiency  was  of  tremendous  benefit  for  the  clay  brick  building  structure.  No  (or  little)   insulation  in  the  walls  meant  heat  would  escape  through  the  wall  assembly  during  the  cold   winter  months.  Any  water  coming  into  contact  with  and  saturating  the  exterior  side  of  the  clay   6  

   brick  would  tend  to  self-dry,  or  at  the  very  least  remain  in  an  unfrozen  state  due  to  the   wintertime  heat  loss  through  the  envelope.  

2.2  MECHANICS  OF  MOISTURE  TRANSFER  IN  CLAY  BRICK      Clay  bricks  are  a  porous  material  containing  thousands  of  microscopic  holes  as  small  as  one- hundredth  of  a  millimeter  wide  (Figure  1).  They  have  an  open  pore  structure  that  winds   throughout,  as  well  as  many  dead-end  pores  that  are  closed  off  from  the  continuous  network  of   pore  caverns.  These  tiny  caverns  interconnect  throughout  the  clay  brick  causing  them  to  have   a  very  large  internal  surface  area  (Straube,  2006).     In  hydrophilic  porous  material,  such  as  clay  brick,  moisture  travels  by  a  number  of  methods.   Bricks  are  comprised  of  a  fired  clay  material,  which  melts  together  during  the  firing  process   and  also  creates  massive  network  of  pores  and  microscopic  tunnels.  These  pores  provide  an   internal  volume  of  space  that  can  be  occupied  by  air  or  water  (Figure  1  and  Figure  2).  When  a   pore  is  fine  enough  (approximately  10-100  nanometers)  water  vapour  in  the  air  condenses  on   the  sides  of  the  pore  walls,  and  forms  a  small  amount  of  liquid  water.  Once  the  water  is  out  of   vapour  form,  and  in  liquid  form  it  travels  through  the  pore  of  the  material  via  a  phenomenon   called  capillary  suction  (Straube  &  Burnett,  2005).  This  phenomenon  occurs  when  water   molecules  are  more  attracted  to  the  molecules  of  the  pore  wall  than  the  molecules  of  the  air,   and  creep  up  the  pore,  causing  a  meniscus  (Hugo  Hens,  2007).  This  creeping  up  of  water   molecules  occurs  in  practically  all  stony  and  wood  materials,  and  are  therefore  called   "hydrophilic"  effect  (Hugo  Hens,  2007).

At  a  high  ambient  relative  humidity,  enough  moisture  condenses  inside  the  pores  of  the  brick   that  it  can  reach  a  point  of  capillary  saturation  (Figure  3).  That  is,  the  point  where  the  brick   cannot  absorb  any  more  moisture  from  the  air.  In  order  to  add  more  moisture  to  a  brick  at  this   point,  it  must  be  supersaturated  with  water.  The  network  of  pores  is  not  entirely   interconnected;  some  are  isolated  and  many  are  dead-ended.  In  order  to  fill  these  dead  ends   with  water,  Hall  and  Hoff  (2012)  note  that  super  saturation  is  "not  easy  to  achieve  and  not   8  

   always  attained."  Brick  specimens  must  use  a  5-hour  boil  method  or  z  vacuum  saturation   method  to  fully  saturate  the  pores.

   The  actual  damage  caused  to  a  clay  brick  by  the  expansion  of  freezing  water  inside  its  pores  is   not  yet  completely  understood  (Mensinga,  2009).  There  are  a  number  of  theories  that  have   been  brought  forward,  but  it  will  likely  be  a  number  of  years  before  the  matter  is  studied  with   great  detail  and  an  outcome  determined.  Nevertheless,  even  with  the  reasons  not  fully   understood  the  fact  still  remains  that  clay  bricks  undergo  irreversible  expansion  when  they   freeze  above  critical  moisture  contents;  this  is  known  as  freeze-thaw  damage.  The  internal   pressures  of  the  freezing  water  can  be  enough  to  slowly  cause  micro-cracks  within  the  pore   matrix.  With  each  cycle  of  freezing  and  thawing,  the  cracks  can  become  larger,  resulting  in  the   clay  brick  slowly  increasing  in  size.  With  each  freeze-thaw  expansion,  the  structural  integrity   of  the  clay  brick  degrades  and  physical  signs  of  damage  become  visible  to  the  naked  eye.  This   irreversible  expansion  caused  by  the  freezing  process  is  called  frost  dilatometry.  It  is  becoming   a  useful  means  of  testing  the  durability  of  clay  brick.  Susceptibility  to  frost  dilatometry  varies   greatly  in  the  various  types  of  clay  brick.  Some  clay  bricks  can  tolerate  undergoing  freezing   with  very  high  moisture  content,  that  is,  water  filling  the  pores  of  the  clay  brick,  without  much   expansion  at  all.  Other  types  of  clay  brick  crumble  apart  quickly  with  only  having  small   moisture  content.     However,  pouring  water  onto  a  clay  brick  does  not  necessarily  mean  it  will  become  saturated   with  water.  Because  the  pores  of  the  clay  brick  are  both  plentiful  and  very  fine,  the  tiny   internal  cavities  create  a  large  internal  surface  area.  Many  of  these  dead-ends  caverns  do  not   easily  fill  with  water  (Figure  2).  The  internal  surface  areas  of  the  clay  brick  also  have  the  ability   to  take  on  and  hold  moisture  from  water  vapour  in  the  air,  by  way  of  adsorption.  That  is,  water   molecules  cling  to  the  extensive  surface  areas  of  the  pore  cavities.  As  the  relative  humidity  of   the  air  increases,  so  do  the  layers  of  water  molecules  clinging  to  the  surfaces  of  the  pores.  At   locations  within  the  clay  brick  where  the  pores  taper  and  bottleneck,  water  molecules  layer  on   11  

   top  of  one  another  until  the  air  is  forced  out  and  a  small  about  of  liquid  water  becomes  present.   Mensinga  discusses  this  moisture  transport  phenomenon  to  great  detail  (Mensinga,  2009).     When  the  relative  humidity  of  the  air  is  very  high,  water  molecules  build  up  on  these  internal   surfaces  in  layers.  The  pores  adsorb  layers  of  water  molecules.  If  the  Relative  Humidity  (RH)  is   large  enough  (or  the  pore  diameter  is  fine  enough),  water  molecules  fill  them  entirely.  They   essentially  become  a  tube  filled  with  liquid  water  that  travels  by  capillary  suction.  "When  a   material  has  adsorbed  all  the  moisture  it  can,  further  moisture  will  be  stored  in  the  pores  and   cracks  within  the  material  by  capillary  suction,  or  by  absorption"  (Straube,  2006).  Water  can   be  adsorbed  by  the  pores  of  the  clay  brick  until  capillary  saturation  is  reached;  at  this  point   saturation  enters  a  "supersaturated"  realm  (Straube  &  Burnett,  2005).  Depending  on  the  type   of  clay  brick  and  the  size  of  the  pores,  in  the  capillary  saturation  region  the  brick  holds  about   95-99%  of  its  maximum  possible  water  storage.  Super-saturating  the  clay  brick  beyond  this   quantity  requires  immersion  into  boiling  water,  or  the  use  of  vacuum  to  draw  out  the   remaining  air.        Water  is  not  detrimental  to  the  integrity  of  clay  brick  masonry  brick  on  its  own;  the  bricks  are   fired  in  a  kiln  until  the  clay  particles  have  fused  together.  Water  alone  will  not  dissolve  them   (Ibstock,  2005).  The  problem  comes  when  such  a  water-saturated  clay  brick  freezes.  Water   achieves  its  maximum  density  at  4Â°C;  once  it  is  cooled  beyond  this  temperature  it  expands  and   decreases  in  density  (Hutcheon  &  Handegord,  1995).  When  frozen  water  inside  a  saturated   pore  of  a  clay  brick  increases  in  size,  the  forces  exerted  within  the  pore  of  the  clay  brick  may   become  too  great  and  the  structure  of  the  clay  brick  will  give  way  in  a  tensile  failure.  When   these  freeze-thaw  cycles  are  repeated,  the  water  within  the  pores  may  warm,  melt  back  into   12  

   liquid  form,  and  fill  any  new  fissure  the  previous  freeze  may  have  created,  refreeze  and  cause   further  cracking  Â­  essentially  a  "snow  ball  effect."  This  is  known  as  freeze-thaw  expansion  or   frost  dilatometry:  clay  bricks  saturated  with  water  to  a  particular  degree  and  exposed  to  cycles   of  freeze-thaw  reveal  irreversible  dimensional  change.        Different  tests  are  performed  on  clay  brick  to  categorize  them  and  reduce  the  chance  of  failure   in  the  field  by  using  freeze-thaw  resistant  clay  bricks.  The  Canadian  standard  for  testing  the   freeze-thaw  capability  of  clay  brick  is  standard  number  CSA-A82-06.  It  is  very  similar  in   procedure  to  its  American  equivalent,  ASTM  C62-13a  in  conjunction  with  ASTM  C67-13a.  If   compressive  strength  and  porosity  criteria  are  not  met,  then  specimens  of  clay  brick  must   undergo  50  cycles  of  freeze-thaw  testing.  The  current  recognized  method  for  testing  clay  brick   is  flawed  and  has  documented  shortcomings;  clay  brick  that  have  passed  the  CSA  and  ASTM   tests  have  failed  in  the  field,  and  clay  bricks  that  have  performed  well  in  constructed  buildings   do  not  meet  the  criteria  of  the  test  (Straube  et  al.,  2010).  New  techniques  are  being  developed   such  as  frost  dilatometry  testing,  which  would  predict  how  a  particular  clay  brick  material   would  thermally  contract  or  dilate,  and  generate  a  "strength  estimate"  based  on  existing   freeze-thaw  threshold  data(Straube  et  al.,  2010).

3.1  FREEZE-THAW  ISSUES      Several  papers  have  been  written  about  clay  brick  masonry  and  potential  negative  effects  that   can  occur  once  a  load  bearing  clay  brick  wall  is  insulated  on  the  interior  (Straube  et  al.,  2010,   2011;  Straube  &  Schumacher,  2007).  However,  this  is  a  relatively  current  topic  and  there  is   room  for  more  research  on  the  matter.        Straube  et  al.  (2011)  discuss  insulation  retrofits.  The  study  contains  much  more  than  just   issues  with  insulating  load  bearing  clay  brick.  It  also  covers  cost  effectiveness  questions  of   adding  insulation  to  walls,  discusses  interior  vs.  exterior  insulation  systems,  all  the  major   insulation  types,  and  also  shows  many  "problem  areas"  and  illustrates  how  to  address  them   with  various  detail  drawings  and  flashing  solutions.  This  paper  only  discusses  insulation  up  to   traditional  levels  of  RSI  3.52  W/m2K  (R-20)  as  do  the  others.  There  appears  to  be  little  known   of  the  effects  of  super-insulating  load  bearing  clay  brick  beyond  this  level  using  900  g  (2  lb.)   closed-cell  SPF  insulation.        Smits,  Gregoire,  Tirlocq,  Lefort,  &  Andre  (2010)  discuss  a  European  method  for  determining   the  frost  resistance  of  clay  brick  that  was  established  in  2006,  and  compare  it  to  the  complex   pre-existing  Belgium  method.  The  purpose  of  this  analysis  is  to  reveal  the  differences  in   measurements  obtained  from  the  two  different  procedures  that  cause  problems  for  brick   manufacturers  and  builders.       14  

   The  report  establishes  that  the  existing  Belgium  test  method  uses  a  complex  calculation   method  to  determine  the  porometric  moisture  distribution  within  a  brick,  which  is  based  on   water  absorption  slopes.  Smits  explains  that  limited  information  exists  on  how  water  is   absorbed  into  bricks  in  situ,  especially  when  factoring  in  general  exposure  severity.  The   moisture  taken  on  from  wind  driven  rain,  moisture  distribution  within  massive  walls,  and  the   effects  of  protected  areas  play  an  essential  part  of  analyzing  the  severity  of  exposure  that  a   brick  must  endure,  so  the  Belgium  Building  Research  Institute  (BBRI)  and  Belgian  Ceramic   Research  Center  (BCRC)  built  exposure  test  sites  to  help  provide  analysis.     The  paper  briefly  explains  the  Belgium  "direct  frost  test  method"  (NBN  B27-009+Add.2)  which   varies  greatly  from  the  CSA  and  ASTM  test  methods  for  bricks  used  in  North  America.    Five   bricks  must  be  tested,  one  outfitted  with  thermocouples  to  measure  temperature  levels  on  two   adjacent  sides  of  a  brick.  The  bricks  are  buried  3  cm  deep  in  sand,  and  then  exposed  to  20   freeze-thaw  cycles.  The  rate  and  duration  of  the  freeze-thaw  cycles  are  dynamic  and  vary   depending  on  the  rate  of  temperature  change  between  the  two  thermocouples.  Each  thaw   cycle  is  accomplished  by  immersing  the  bricks  and  sand  in  15Â°C  water  until  the  bricks  reach   10Â°C.   The  European  test  method  calls  for  clay  bricks  to  be  tested  as  constructed,  so  tests  must  be   performed  with  brick  units  mortared  into  position  in  a  section  of  a  test  wall  assembly.  Both   Belgium  and  European  test  methods  evaluate  frost  damage  by  way  of  visual  inspection  only.   Attempts  have  been  made  by  the  BBRI  and  BCRC  to  quantitatively  measure  the  effects  of   freeze-thaw  damage  by  determining  loss  of  dynamic  elasticity  modulus,  also  known  as  the   `pull-off  adhesion  test.'

   This  paper  does  not  address  the  critical  saturation  point  of  brick;  it  only  identifies  bricks  as   pass  or  fail  by  the  Belgium  and  European  methods.  The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  solely  to   compare  the  differences  of  the  existing  Belgium  method  and  the  newer  European  test  method.   Visual  inspection  for  damage  to  clay  masonry  caused  by  cycles  of  freeze-thaw  is  one  of  the  test   procedure  still  performed  according  to  the  Belgium  procedure.  However,  it  appears  to  only  be   performed  on  laboratory  specimens,  and  not  on  a  scale  that  involves  all  surfaces  of  an  entire   building.      In  North  America  there  are  currently  two  standard  test  methods  for  determining  the  freeze- thaw  capabilities  of  clay  brick.  ASTM  C62-13a  "Standard  Specification  for  Building  Brick"  is   used  in  conjunction  with  ASTM  C67-13a  "Standard  Test  Methods  for  Sampling  and  Testing   Brick  and  Structural  Clay  Tile"  and  they  are  the  international  test  criteria  established  by  the   United  States,  while  Canada  uses  its  own  CSA  A82-06  "Fired  masonry  brick  made  from  clay  or   shale."  Both  procedures  have  essentially  the  same  requirements,  and  as  noted  above,  both   have  been  found  to  have  their  flaws.  The  criteria  for  a  brick  to  pass  the  CSA  freeze-thaw   durability  test  requires  the  brick  to  have  a  5  hour  boiling  water  absorption  of  no  more  than   17%,  a  maximum  saturation  coefficient  of  0.78,  an  individual  brick  compressive  strength  of  at   least  17.2  MPa,  and  a  5-brick-average  compressive  strength  of  at  least  20.7  MPa.  The  criteria   for  a  brick  to  pass  the  ASTM  freeze-thaw  durability  tests  are  essentially  identical  to  those  of   the  CSA  requirements.  (The  5-brick  average  values  must  demonstrate  a  5-hour  boiling  water   absorption  of  no  more  than  17%,  a  maximum  saturation  coefficient  of  0.78,  and  a  compressive   strength  of  20.7  MPa,  and  an  individual  brick  compressive  strength  of  17.2  MPa.)  For  both  the   ASTM  and  the  CSA  standards,  if  the  brick  specimens  do  not  conform  to  these  established   16  

   absorption  and  compressive  strength  requirements,  then  the  brick  must  then  be  tested  for  50   cycles  of  freeze  thaw.        Hall  (1977)  quantitatively  discusses  moisture  flow  within  porous  media,  and  the  drying  effect   caused  by  the  exposure  of  a  wetted  porous  medium  to  moving  air.  His  paper  discusses  the   energy  transfer  and  technical  mechanics  of  adsorption,  capillary  condensation  and  internal   moisture  flow  that  occur  within  porous  media.  The  hysteresis  effect  of  sorption  isotherms  (i.e.   the  difference  in  rates  of  adsorption  and  desorption  at  which  a  porous  medium  takes  on  and   releases  moisture)  is  also  discussed  and  explains  how  moisture  sorption  occur  at  different   rates  depending  on  a  number  of  factors  such  as  partial  vapour  pressure  of  the  air  in  which   moisture  is  moving  into,  the  pore  structure  of  the  porous  medium,  etc.  The  paper  limits  its   discussion  to  moisture  flow,  and  does  not  venture  much  beyond  this  topic;  the  problems   resulting  from  moisture  flow  in  building  materials  (i.e.,  mould,  and  freeze-thaw  damage)  are   not  covered.        The  discussion  by  Roels  et  al.  (2004)  concerning  the  variability  of  measurements  recorded  by   6  different  laboratories  in  the  HAMSTAD-project  in  the  European  Union.  The  HAMSTAD   project  was  an  initiative  of  the  European  Union  designed  to  compare  measurement  variability   observed  when  analyzing  the  hygric  properties  of  various  porous  materials  between  various   laboratories.  It  is  a  reminder  of  how  laboratory  variability  exists.  Great  care  must  be  taken   whenever  analysing  laboratory  specimens.  The  report  compares  measurement  variability  of   moisture  capacity  and  moisture  transport  of  only  three  different  porous  materials:  calcium   silicate  plate,  fired  clay  brick  and  cellular  concrete.  The  discussion  covers  simple  measurement   17  

   techniques  (such  as  vacuum  saturation  testing,  and  free  water  uptake  testing)  and  more   complex  methods  (such  as  mercury  intrusion  experiments)  without  going  into  any   measurement  procedures.  The  report  does  not  mention  any  aspects  of  freeze-thaw  testing  as   part  of  their  variability  comparison.        KÃ¼nzel  (1998)  compares  interior  side  insulation  vs.  exterior  side  insulation  on  brick  and  stone   masonry  exterior  wall  retrofit  projects  by  using  an  early  rendition  of  the  WUFI  computer   program.  The  paper  states  "elevated  moisture...on  exposed  walls  can  lead  to  frost  damage"  but   KÃ¼nzel  does  not  elaborate  upon  or  quantify  the  "damage"  beyond  this  point.  The  paper  does   state  that  by  adding  insulation  to  the  interior  side  of  the  wall,  the  drying  capacity  is  reduced   due  to  lowering  the  temperature.  Exterior-side  insulation  retrofits  are  effective  from  a   technical  standpoint,  as  they  not  only  keep  the  brick  wall  warm,  they  can  provide  a  barrier  to   rain-driven  moisture,  reducing  the  moisture  within  the  brick  masonry  wall  depending  on  the   type  of  insulation  used.      Delghust,  Janssens,  &  Rummens  (2010)  investigate  retrofitting  brick  cavity  walls  with  various   types  of  insulation,  as  a  method  of  reducing  energy  use  in  the  great  number  of  Flemish   (Northern  Belgium)  post-war  residential  houses.  The  paper  is  regionally  specific  to  northern   Belgium  due  to  the  large  number  of  uninsulated  cavity-wall  houses,  and  therefore  only  focuses   on  cavity-wall  retrofits.  Research  measurements  include  in-situ  heat  flux  measurements,  and   do  not  include  any  moisture  measurements.  Since  moisture  is  not  measured,  the  effects  of   freeze-thaw  damage  on  brick  are  not  considered  in  this  paper.        18  

   Brocken  (1998)  discusses  moisture  transport  in  porous  brick  and  mortar,  and  goes  into  great   depth  examining  pore  structure  within  these  media.  The  primary  focus  of  Brocken's  book  is   the  moisture  transport  mechanisms  between  brick  units  and  the  mortar  that  hold  the  bricks  in   position  in  brick  masonry  walls.  The  pore  structure  of  a  brick,  and  its  moisture  transport   characteristics  begin  having  an  effect  on  brick  masonry  the  moment  the  wall  is  constructed:   the  quality  of  the  mortar  joint  is  partially  determined  during  the  construction  process.  The   brick  can  draw  moisture  out  of  the  mortar  before  it  properly  cures,  creating  a  mortar  that  is   not  optimally  hydrated.  Conversely,  a  porous  brick  that  is  wetted  prior  to  installation  can  over- hydrate  the  mortar  joint  during  the  curing  process,  creating  a  weak  layer  in  the  mortar.   Brocken  goes  into  these  relationships  in  great  detail,  and  explains  the  different  chemical   contents  within  the  mortar  joint  at  various  depths  away  from  the  brick-mortar  joint  interface.   Brocken  iterates  how  moisture  transport  is  an  important  aspect  of  brick  masonry,  as  it  is  the   mechanism  for  many  destructive  phenomena,  including  frost  damage.  However,  frost  damage   is  a  topic  that  is  not  explored  to  any  detail  in  this  book,  other  than  mention  of  the  frost   resistance  of  air-entrained  mortars.      Abuku,  Janssen,  &  Roels,  (2009)  discuss  in  their  paper  the  effects  of  wind-driven  rain  on   historic  brick  masonry  wall  construction.  The  research  is  based  on  a  building  situated  in  a  cool   climate  and  with  high  interior  humidity  to  analyze  the  hygrothermal  characteristics  of  the  wall   assemblies.  The  ultimate  reasoning  for  the  research  is  for  the  control  of  mould  growth  on  the   interior  side  of  the  wall,  and  energy  load  on  the  building  being  tested.  Damage  to  the  brick   masonry  as  a  result  of  saturated  freeze-thaw  was  not  within  the  scope  of  this  research  project.        19  

   Adan  et  al.  (2004)  discuss  how  moisture  problem  tolerant  building  can  reduce  health  related   issues  and  reduce  repair  costs,  and  also  can  increase  energy  consumption.  The  paper  discusses   how  the  "Glaser  method"  is  used  to  determine  if  vapour  diffusion  will  lead  to  interstitial   moisture  problems  within  a  building  envelope,  and  that  it  does  not  allow  for  capillary  moisture   flow.  Porous  exterior  materials,  such  as  brick  and  concrete,  are  misrepresented  by  the  old   calculation  method.  The  paper  refers  to  the  2001  "HAMSTAD"  project  in  the  European  Union   as  an  attempt  to  standardize  the  process  for  determining  moisture  transfer  methods  in   building  envelopes.  This  paper  does  not  go  into  any  specific  calculations.  The  effects  of  freeze- thaw  are  beyond  the  content  of  this  paper.        Carmeliet  &  Roels  (2002)  focus  on  comparing  different  analytical  functions  that  have  been   established  in  various  pieces  of  building  science  literature  to  assess  the  moisture  permeability   and  moisture  storage  function  of  porous  media.  They  point  out  there  is  no  agreement  of  the   form  of  these  functions,  or  any  consensus  on  the  experimental  procedures  for  determining  the   input  data  for  such  moisture  functions.  As  a  result,  calculation  of  moisture  storage  can  be  over- simplified,  or  may  require  a  great  deal  of  effort  to  determine  a  precise  figure.  Carmeliet  and   Roels  discuss  critical  moisture  content  and  introduce  it  as  the  transition  point  where  moisture   inside  capillaries  changes  from  "enhanced  vapour  flow"  to  "dominant  liquid  flow."  The  paper   solely  discusses  pores  filling  with  liquid  or  vaporous  moisture.  Freezing  pores  above  or  below   the  critical  saturation  point  is  not  a  topic  discussed  in  this  paper.      KlÃµseiko,  ArumÃ¤gi,  &  Kalamees  (2003)  report  on  a  study  of  four  different  insulation  types   (calcium  silicate,  aerated  concrete,  polyurethane  board,  and  polyisocyanurate  board)  to   20  

   insulate  on  the  interior  side,  an  area  of  load  bearing  brick  wall  of  a  historic  school  building  in   central  Europe.  The  brick  wall  was  outfitted  with  sensors  to  monitor  temperature  and  relative   humidity  levels.  The  performance  of  the  four  different  insulation  types  were  monitored  and   compared.  KlÃµseiko  et  al.  briefly  discuss  freeze-thaw  in  this  report,  and  mention  that  freeze- thaw  damage  can  begin  to  occur  in  brick  when  saturated  areas  fall  below  the  freezing  point  to   as  low  as  -5  Â°C.  Freeze-thaw  damage  is  not  elaborated  upon  beyond  this,  and  there  is  no   discussion  of  the  amount  of  moisture  that  constitutes  the  saturation  of  a  brick.      In  his  paper,  Hens  (1998)  focuses  on  retrofitting  "traditional"  (massive)  masonry  walls  with   interior  side  insulation.  The  paper  addresses  airtightness  of  the  masonry,  prediction  of  the  U- value  of  the  wall  assembly,  which  includes  the  hygric  analysis  of  "T-junctions"  in  the  wall   where  the  interior  wood  studs  are  positioned  directly  adjacent  to  the  brick  masonry.  The  only   topic  of  concern  regarding  cold  temperatures  in  this  paper  is  the  occurrence  of  interstitial   condensation  within  the  wall  envelope.  The  occurrence  of  freeze-thaw  damage  is  a  topic  not   discussed  in  this  paper,  other  than  a  sudden  suggestion  in  the  conclusion  to  face-seal  brick   masonry  only  where  not  exposed  to  cycles  of  freeze-thaw.

   3.2  FROST  DILATOMETRY  TEST  METHOD      Mensinga  (2009)  investigates  using  a  new  procedure  to  determine  the  maximum  degree  of   water  saturation  a  material  can  have  before  it  undergoes  irreversible  expansion  from  freezing   and  thawing  Â­  critical  saturation  testing.  Much  of  the  procedure  stems  from  work  by  Fagerlund   (1977)  who  wrote  a  procedure  for  measuring  the  critical  saturation  point  of  concrete.   Knowing  this  critical  saturation  point  of  porous  materials  such  as  clay  brick  or  concrete  help  to   accurately  determine  the  maximum  safe  moisture  load  such  a  material  can  endure,  and  is   arguably  a  more  reliable  measure  of  how  a  porous  material  like  clay  brick  will  perform  in  the   field.  Mensinga  (2009)  outlines  in  detail  how  the  frost  dilatometry  procedure  was  performed  Â­   all  work  was  completed  in  a  lab.  The  scope  of  this  paper  does  not  go  on  to  measure  the  in  situ   moisture  content  of  the  tested  clay  bricks  in  service  in  a  real  building.  Also,  the  dilatometry   expansion  of  the  clay  brick  samples  was  only  measured  along  one  axis.  (The  100  mm  "width"   of  the  clay  brick;  not  along  the  length  or  height.)  The  need  exists  to  conduct  multi-dimensional   frost  dilatometry  in  order  to  further  advance  this  novel  method  of  estimating  resistance  to   freeze  thaw  deterioration.        Fagerlund  (1977)  presents  the  new  procedure  for  testing  the  freeze-thaw  capabilities  of   concrete  in  this  procedure.  The  procedure  introduces  the  critical  saturation  point  as  being  the   key  to  frost  dilatometry  analysis.  The  procedure  outlines  two  methods  of  testing:  a  full  test  and   a  shortened  test.  This  is  the  original  frost  dilatometry  testing  procedure,  and  is  the  one  used  by   Peter  Mensinga  in  his  2009  thesis.        22  

   Johansson  et  al.  (2014)  consider  potential  problems  that  arise  when  installing  energy  retrofits   (insulation)  in  existing  building  stock.  Their  particular  research  involves  using  VIPs  as  a   retrofit  insulation  material,  and  study  the  moisture  related  effects  that  their  introduction  to   the  wall  has  on  wooden  beam  ends  embedded  in  the  load  bearing  brick  masonry  walls.  The   study  is  limited  to  wind-driven  rain  onto  the  surface,  capillary  moisture  flow  through  and   saturation  of  various  brick  types,  and  the  accumulation  of  moisture  in  the  interior  side  of  the   wall  against  the  VIPs  using  accelerated  aging  experiments  on  the  VIPs,  and  by  using  one-  and   two-dimensional  hygrothermal  analysis  to  determine  moisture  accumulation  at  the  interface   where  the  wood  structure  connects  to  the  brick  masonry  wall.  This  is  where  moisture  could  be   a  problem  for  the  longevity  of  the  wood  structure.     The  paper  stops  short  of  investigating  any  effects  of  freezing  of  the  capillary  saturated  bricks.   Mention  is  made  of  previous  research  being  performed  in  the  US  by  Straube  et  al.  in  North   America,  showing  increased  moisture  content  and  RH  within  the  wall,  which  can  also  increase   the  rick  of  freeze-thaw  damage.  The  paper  also  briefly  discusses  how  capillaries  within  brick   that  are  over-saturated  with  water  and  then  exposed  to  multiple  freeze-thaw  cycles  can  lead  to   freeze-thaw  damage,  and  refers  to  work  performed  by  Mensinga  et  al  (2010)  and  their   development  of  the  frost  dilatometry  technique  to  determine  critical  saturation  point.

   3.3  FROST  DILATOMETRY  IN-FIELD  MEASUREMENTS      Wilkinson  et  al  (2009)  present  a  field  study  similar  in  nature  to  the  Toronto  test  house  being   studied  with  this  thesis.  Instead  of  a  century  house,  the  subject  building  was  a  1950s  school.   The  clay  brick  analysis  was  performed  to  CSA-A82-06  test  methods  (Wilkinson  et  al.,  2009)  Â­  a   test  procedure  with  known  flaws.  The  flaws  are  acknowledged  in  the  paper:  CSA  testing   requires  a  clay  brick  not  be  highly  absorptive,  and  also  must  pass  50  saturated  freeze  thaw   cycles  without  swelling  (Wilkinson  et  al.,  2009).  Clay  bricks  have  been  known  to  pass  the  CSA   tests  given  these  requirements,  and  then  fail  in  the  field  and  vice  versa  (Straube,  Schumacher,   &  Mensinga,  2010).   Wilkinson  et  al.,  (2009)  also  acknowledge  challenges  with  use  of  wood  surrogate  moisture   content  sensors  that  they  embedded  in  the  brick.  The  authors  felt  the  sensors  were  too  large,   and  provided  a  slow  response  to  wetting  events  from  rain.  During  a  rain-wetting  event,  water   is  absorbed  through  the  face  of  the  clay  brick  via  capillary  suction,  a  process  that  could  take   minutes  to  hours  depending  of  the  characteristics  of  the  clay  brick.  When  the  wetting  event   ends,  the  clay  brick  dries  as  water  vapour  is  released  from  the  clay  brick  back  into  the  air  Â­  the   drying  time  can  take  much  longer  especially  if  the  relative  humidity  is  high  or  if  there  is  little   airflow  around  the  clay  brick.  The  tight  fit  of  the  wooden  surrogate  sensor  within  the  clay  brick   plays  a  role  in  the  measurement  time:  any  extra  gaps  slow  the  time  it  takes  for  the  moisture   content  to  equilibrate  between  clay  brick  and  wood  sensor.  Any  extra  gap  means  moisture  will   not  travel  by  capillary  flow  alone  Â­  there  would  also  be  a  component  of  slower  vapour   transport  through  the  airspace,  and  adsorption  into  the  wooden  sensor.  For  these  reasons,   embedded  moisture  content  sensors  provide  a  slow  response  time,  and  the  problem  may  be   exacerbated  by  the  dynamic  nature  of  an  outdoor  wall  exposed  to  the  elements.     24

4  THESIS  OBJECTIVES      A  house  in  Toronto  has  recently  been  renovated  and  insulated  on  the  interior  side,  creating  a   unique  opportunity  to  measure  how  moisture  transports  within  a  recently-insulated  load   bearing  brick  masonry  wall,  which  was  in  serviceable  condition  at  the  time  of  renovation.  This   Toronto  test  house  presents  the  opportunity  to  measure  how  temperature  and  moisture  are   stratified  throughout  the  entire  building  envelope  assembly.  By  using  sensors  and   instrumentation,  the  temperature  and  moisture  content  can  be  measured  in  the  clay  brick   units,  and  temperature  and  relative  humidity  can  be  measured  through  the  rest  of  the  building   envelope.  The  sensor  measurements  can  then  be  correlated  to  weather  conditions  at  the   exterior,  and  also  climate  conditions  on  the  interior.  Such  information  is  useful  for  determining   the  drying  characteristics  of  brick  masonry  walls,  their  moisture  content  during  freeze-thaw   cycles,  and  the  number  of  freeze-thaw  cycles  experienced  during  the  winter.  If  the  critical   saturation  point  on  the  brick  is  also  known,  the  use  of  sensors  could  be  used  to  warn  of   potential  damage  in  critical  locations  of  a  building.  At  the  very  least,  information  from  sensors   can  provide  a  benchmark  that  would  allow  for  the  future  creation  of  a  precision-tuned  WUFI   computer  model  to  predict  the  drying  capabilities  of  an  exterior  wall.        The  primary  objectives  of  this  thesis  are  to:   1. Contribute  to  the  existing  knowledge  of  historic  clay  brick  freeze-thaw  deterioration   resistance  of  interior  super-insulated  load  bearing  clay  brick  walls,   2. Further  develop  the  use  of  frost  dilatometry  as  a  viable  test  method  for  measuring  the   durability  of  clay  brick  in  situ,     26  

   3. Contribute  towards  a  method  of  determining  whether  load  bearing  clay  brick  of  a   particular  building  can  safely  be  insulated  on  the  interior  side,  and   4. Because  the  project  will  require  invasive  installation  techniques  to  install  sensors  into  the   brick  wythes,  additional  sensors  will  be  installed  in  order  to  obtain  a  complete   temperature  and  moisture  profile  of  the  complete  building  envelope.  This  would  allow  for   the  creation  a  finely  tuned  WUFI  model  in  the  future  as  a  project  beyond  the  scope  of  this   thesis.  The  project  will  also  require  the  determination  of  the  critical  saturation  point  of  the   clay  brick,  which  is  value  that  can  be  used  to  create  a  high  precision  WUFI  model.  The   determination  of  the  brick  A-value  is  also  of  great  importance  when  creating  a  finely  tuned   WUFI  computer  model,  and  can  easily  be  determined  in  the  lab  with  brick  specimens  that   are  already  available.

   4.1  RESEARCH  QUESTIONS      From  the  thesis  objectives,  and  review  of  previously  written  papers  in  this  area,  the  following   objectives  have  been  developed  for  this  case  study:   1. Is  it  possible  to  create  a  simple  reference  tool  for  future  visual  inspection  of  insulated   load-bearing  brick  walls?     2. Does  the  recently  installed  RSI  7.9  W/m2K  levels  of  interior  insulation  cause  the  wall  to   cool  to  the  point  where  it  tends  to  freeze  and  stay  frozen  in  the  winter,  reducing  the   number  of  freeze/thaw  cycles?   3. In  terms  of  frost  dilatometry  of  the  clay  brick  at  the  Toronto  test  house,  is  the  expansion   greater  along  any  particular  dimension,  or  is  expansion  equal  and  uniform  in  all   directions?   4. Is  it  possible  to  use  sensors  embedded  in  the  brick  wall  in  situ  to  accurately  determine  the   moisture  content  of  the  brick  in  real  time,  without  the  need  for  destructive  testing?

   5.  METHODOLOGY      This  research  project  has  been  split  into  sections:  field  measurements  and  laboratory  research.   Field  measurements  include  everything  to  do  with  the  visual  documentation  of  existing   conditions  of  the  test  building,  as  well  as  in-field  sensors  work.  Laboratory  research  was   performed  in  the  Building  Science  Laboratory  at  Ryerson  University.  The  work  undertaken  in   the  lab  included  preparing  and  analyzing  brick  specimens.     Visual  documentation  and  field  measurements  were  generally  performed  at  the  beginning  of   the  project,  while  research  and  lab  work  were  generally  performed  in  the  latter  half  of  the   project.

5.1.1  VISUAL  INSPECTION  AND  RECORDING      If  the  brick  units  at  the  Toronto  test  house  begin  to  degrade  and  spall  in  the  future,  one  method   to  visually  quantify  the  deterioration  of  brick  is  to  compare  the  then-and-now  conditions  by   referring  to  a  photo  journal  of  the  elevation  surfaces.  High-resolution  photographs  taken  at   close  proximity  to  the  brick  surface  are  required  to  make  this  possible.  The  problem  is  that  a   single  family  home  with  two  stories  of  brick  masonry  on  all  four  elevations  produces  hundreds   of  photographs  when  taken  at  close  proximity  to  the  wall.  Furthermore,  photographs  of  brick   masonry  look  very  similar  to  one  another.  This  can  present  a  challenging  task  of  managing  and   cataloguing  the  hundreds  of  exterior  wall  photographs.  It  can  be  cumbersome  to  locate  the   correct  photograph  with  the  desired  area  of  interest  of  wall  elevation  through  the  use  of  a   photograph  database  and  a  key  map  system.     In  order  to  simplify  the  organization  of  these  photographs,  a  new  method  is  being  used:  the   generation  of  large  composite  images  from  hundreds  of  high-resolution  photographs  taken  of   the  elevations.  This  process  involves  stitching  the  hundreds  of  photographs  into  a  few  very   large  "giga-pixel"  images.  For  this  task  AutoPano  Giga  computer  software  was  utilized  (Kolor   SARL,  2014).  This  advanced  image  stitching  software  is  intended  to  stitch  together   photographs  from  a  single  capture  point,  however  with  some  effort  a  linear  progression  of   individual  photographs  taken  along  a  plane  can  also  be  stitched  together.  The  software  has  a   detection  engine  that  locates  similar  reference  points  amongst  the  overlapping  areas  of  two  or   more  images,  and  then  automatically  joins  them  together  into  a  single  rendered  image.  Other   30  

   pieces  of  software  are  also  available,  however  AutoPano  Giga  was  chosen  as  it  appeared  to  be   one  of  the  most  advanced  pieces  of  software  capable  of  stitching  large  quantities  of  high- resolution  photos  at  the  time  of  this  project.     All  elevations  of  the  building  have  been  thoroughly  surveyed  up  close  at  each  storey.   Photographs  were  taken  approximately  every  0.75  m2  using  a  10  megapixel  point-and-shoot   camera.  Photos  were  taken  from  grade,  and  then  slowly  up  each  of  the  elevations.  Scaffolding   and  a  boom-mounted  camera  were  utilized  to  access  and  record  the  condition  of  the  brick  at   upper  levels  of  the  Toronto  test  house.  Individual  images  were  input  into  the  AutoPano  Giga   software,  and  were  stitched  into  2-dimensional  quilts  of  large  high-resolution  images.  Given   the  current  limitations  of  JPG  file  sizes  and  Adobe  Photoshop  file  limitations,  each  elevation   had  to  be  broken  into  multiple  images.  A  total  of  13  giga-pixel  composite  images  were   rendered  for  this  project,  and  are  available  online  (Section  6.1  Photo-Documenting  Elevations   of  the  Test  House).  Areas  of  these  giga-pixel  elevation  images  can  be  analysed  and  compared  to   sensor  measurements  recorded  around  the  house,  and  also  provide  a  reference  point  for   potential  future  work  studying  long-term  effects  of  interior-side  insulation  of  load  bearing  clay   brick.  The  current  condition  of  all  exterior  clay  brick  surfaces  has  been  documented,  and  may   be  reviewed  for  signs  of  deterioration  over  the  upcoming  years.

What  makes  this  particular  dwelling  unique  and  well  suited  to  this  project  is  that  it  underwent   a  deep  retrofit  in  2009.  The  interior  of  the  building  was  stripped  down  to  the  clay  brick   masonry  (only  floor  joists  remained);  floors  and  interior  walls  were  reconstructed  to  allow  for   the  installation  of  138  mm  to  190  mm  (5.5  to  7.5  inches)  of  900  g  (2-lb)  closed-cell  spray- applied  polyurethane  foam  insulation  directly  on  the  interior  face  of  the  exterior  clay  brick   masonry  walls.  The  envelope  of  the  building  went  from  being  essentially  uninsulated  solid  clay   brick  masonry  to  having  an  average  insulating  value  of  RSI  7.9  W/m2K  (R-45)  for  the  walls,   completely  changing  the  moisture  transport/storage  characteristics  of  the  building.

   Sensor  cluster  "P"  is  installed  low  on  the  East  wall  of  the  house,  approximately  1  m  from  grade.   This  east  wall  is  a  0.75  m  wide  corridor  that  provides  access  from  the  street  to  the  back  yard.   With  the  neighbouring  house  so  close,  the  eaves  of  the  two  buildings  provide  enough  overhang   to  shelter  the  walls  from  the  majority  of  rainfall  and  sunlight.     Sensor  cluster  "Q"  is  installed  mid-height  of  the  East  wall  at  the  second  storey.  The  different   vertical  position  is  intended  to  reveal  different  results  caused  by  moisture  wicking  up  from  the   foundation  and  also  from  wind-carried  precipitation  blown  through  the  corridor.     Sensor  cluster  "R"  is  installed  on  the  north  wall  of  the  house:  it  is  covered  by  a  deep  overhang   that  protects  the  front  porch  from  rainfall.  Also,  this  North  wall  is  never  exposed  to  direct   sunlight  in  the  wintertime,  so  will  provide  a  benchmark  free  of  direct  solar  radiation.   Sensor  cluster  "S"  is  installed  on  the  south  wall;  this  area  of  wall  is  exposed  to  the  most  rain,   and  also  to  the  most  direct  solar  radiation.  Location  S  is  where  we  expect  to  see  the  greatest   extremes  of  wetting,  drying,  daytime  heating,  and  night-time  cooling.     Sensor  clusters  are  not  installed  on  the  West  wall.  A  solid  gate  at  the  south  end  of  the  buildings   block  the  lower  portion  of  the  west  corridor  (Figure  9).  The  gate  appears  to  impede  airflow  as   the  clay  bricks  are  drying  inadequately  on  both  this  test  house  as  well  as  the  neighbouring   building  at  this  location.  The  clay  brick  walls  are  generally  damp  to  the  touch,  and  there  are   signs  of  moss  growth  beginning  on  areas  of  the  walls.  It  was  decided  this  microclimate  is  not   representative  of  the  overall  exposure  experienced  by  the  clay  brick  masonry  at  this  site.  As   such,  the  various  sensors  of  cluster  "Q"  were  installed  on  the  East  at  2nd  floor  height,  instead  of   on  the  West  wall.  The  added  benefit  of  this  positioning  the  sensor  clusters  in  this  manner   allowed  for  the  comparison  of  two  different  areas  of  the  same  East  wall.

   These  sensors  rely  on  moisture  transferring  from  the  clay  brick  into  the  12  mm  diameter   hemlock  dowel  via  capillary  transport  and/or  vapour  diffusion.  As  the  moisture  content  of  the   wood  increases,  so  does  its  resistance  (Straube,  Onysko,  &  Schumacher,  2002).  The  moisture   content  of  the  wood  embedded  in  the  clay  brick  (and  therefore  the  moisture  content  of  the  clay   brick)  can  be  predicted  as  a  function  of  resistance  and  temperature.  High  precision  24-bit  SMT   data  acquisition  units  (SMT  Research  Ltd.,  n.d.)  are  programmed  to  record  the  moisture   content  ("%MC")  every  15  minutes.        43

Sensors  installed  in  the  exterior  wythe  of  brick  are  inserted  vertically  and  parallel  to  the   exterior  face  through  holes  drilled  through  the  bottom  of  the  clay  bricks;  the  sides  of  the   44

The  most  reliable  way  to  measure  moisture  content  in  clay  brick  masonry  is  by  gravimetric   measurement  in  a  laboratory  (Fagerlund,  1977).  By  thoroughly  drying  a  clay  brick  specimen   49  

   for  a  few  days  in  a  drying  oven,  its  dry  weight  can  be  determined  and  used  calculate  the  weight   of  water  content  at  any  point  in  time  thereafter  (Appendix  A,  Procedure  1).  Unfortunately,  this   is  not  an  option  when  clay  bricks  are  mortared  in  place  in  a  wall  as  part  of  a  building.        An  alternate  method  to  measure  moisture  content  in  clay  brick  is  to  use  a  surrogate  material   that  has  characteristics  that  lends  well  to  electrical  resistance  measurements.  One  of  the   natural  characteristics  of  wood  is  that  its  electrical  resistance  changes  depending  on  the   amount  of  moisture  contained  within  the  pores  of  the  wood.  This  characteristic  is  true  of  most   woods,  however  certain  species  such  as  hemlock  are  better  for  this  application  than  others.   The  resistance  is  consistent  in  clear  (free  of  knots)  wood  specimens,  and  its  resistance-to- moisture  content  curve  is  relatively  linear.  As  the  moisture  content  of  wood  increases,  its   measurable  resistance  drops  (Figure  26).  Also  the  sorption  isotherm  for  wood  has  a  slope  that   makes  it  easier  to  relate  the  moisture  content  to  the  relative  humidity  than  a  sorption  curve  for   a  material  such  as  brick  (Refer  to  Section  2.3  Moisture  Content  VS.  Relative  Humidity  in  Porous   media).

   These  clay  bricks  were  analysed  for  two-  and  three-dimensional  frost  dilatometry,  water   absorption  uptake  (A-value),  moisture  storage  curves  and  also  to  generate  calibration  curves   for  the  moisture  content  sensors.  Porosity  and  density  can  easily  be  calculated  using  data   obtained  during  the  frost  dilatometry  analysis.  Most  of  these  pieces  of  data  are  required  for   any  future  WUFI  analysis  to  take  place.  In  addition  to  the  century  old  clay  bricks  from  the   Toronto  test  house,  12  contemporary  clay  bricks  from  a  Canada  wide  manufacturer  (Hanson   Building  Products,  2014)  were  also  cut  into  10  mm  wide  specimens.  They  were  tested  for  2- dimensional  frost  dilatometry  to  compare  against  the  century  old  clay  brick,  and  to  help   establish  a  benchmark  of  acceptable  frost-dilatometry  results.  These  contemporary  clay  bricks   54  

   did  not  have  "frog"  indentations  in  the  bottoms;  they  had  hollow  cores  that  passed  clear   through  the  clay  brick.  As  a  result,  each  of  the  contemporary  clay  bricks  yielded  only  4   specimens,  whereas  the  century  old  clay  brick  yielded  12  to  17  specimens  (Figure  29).

The  Critical  Saturation  point  has  been  determined  by  way  of  frost  dilatometry  analysis.  As  well,   the  determination  of  their  A-value  (water  absorption  curve)  has  also  been  measured.  (Refer  to   Appendix  A  -  Procedures  for  the  process  used  for  measuring  frost  dilatometry  and  A-value.)   Knowing  the  critical  saturation  point  and  A-value  allows  for  the  future  creation  of  a  finely   tuned  WUFI  computer  model  of  the  Toronto  test  house  wall  assembly.  A  WUFI  model  could  be   calibrated  against  the  results  measured  from  the  actual  walls.  With  an  accurate  computer   model  in  place,  long-term  analysis  of  the  wall  could  be  projected.

   5.2.1.1  DIMENSIONING  THE  CLAY  BRICK  SPECIMENS      Frost  dilatometry  is  the  process  being  used  to  identify  the  critical  saturation  point  of  the  clay   brick  specimens.  The  process  for  pinpointing  the  critical  saturation  point  is  an  iterative  one.   Once  a  clay  brick  specimen  with  a  particular  moisture  content  shows  signs  of  frost  dilatometry   (i.e.  permanently  expansion),  it  must  be  discarded.  A  new  clay  brick  specimen  with  a  different   moisture  content  must  then  be  analysed.  This  process  is  repeated  until  the  critical  saturation   point  of  the  clay  brick  specimen  has  been  narrowed  in  upon  (Mensinga,  2009).  Refer  to   Appendix  A  -  Procedures  for  the  process  steps  that  have  been  followed.      Slicing  the  Brick  Specimens   The  whole  clay  bricks  of  the  Toronto  test  house  are  true  2-1/2"  x  4"  x  8-3/4"  in  dimension  (64   mm  x  102  mm  x  222  mm).  The  clay  bricks  are  sliced  into  small  specimens  using  a  tile-cutting   wet  saw  (American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials,  2014b).  The  ends  of  the  clay  bricks  are   discarded,  and  then  they  are  sliced  up  like  a  loaf  of  bread,  into  10  mm  thick  specimens  (Figure   31).  The  clay  bricks  are  typically  10  mm  x  64  mm  x  102  mm.  (3/8"  x  2-1/2"  x  4")  and  each  clay   brick  produces  about  17  samples  (Figure  30).

   Dimensioning  the  Specimens   In  order  to  accurately  measure  the  amount  of  expansion  in  the  clay  brick  samples,  ratchet   micrometers  accurate  to  Â±0.00381  mm  (Â±0.00015")  are  used  to  measure  the  samples  along   three  axes  (Figure  32).  To  reduce  wear  on  clay  brick  from  the  rotating  anvil  of  the  micrometer,   metal  pins  are  installed  4  mm  deep  into  the  clay  brick,  along  the  length  and  the  width  of  the   samples  (Figure  31).  Pins  are  not  installed  in  the  face  of  the  1  cm  thick  clay  brick  samples;  if   pins  were  set  into  these  samples  to  a  depth  of  4  mm,  there  would  have  been  insufficient  clay   brick  between  the  pins  to  accurately  measure  any  strain.  Instead,  accurate  measurement  along   the  third  "z-axis"  are  limited  to  the  half-brick  samples  (Figure  32).  Eight  half  sized  clay  bricks   (64  mm  x  100  mm  x  100  mm)  are  set  aside  for  this  expansion  comparison.  The  thickness  ("z- axis")  measurement  of  the  10  mm  samples  is  attempted  with  0"  to  1"  ratchet  micrometer   calliper,  but  the  measurements  obtained  seemed  to  have  large  erroneous  numbers;  this  is   likely  due  a  few  factors.  The  wear  on  the  clay  brick  surface  by  the  rotation  of  the  closing   calliper,  the  soft  constitution  of  the  clay  brick,  the  fact  that  the  faces  of  the  clay  bricks  were  not   57  

   necessarily  perfectly  parallel,  and  the  thin  10  mm  samples  expanding  only  a  minute  amount.   The  error  from  these  small  specimen  "z-axis"  thickness  measurements  is  far  greater  than  the   strain  expansion  across  the  other  two  axes.        The  first  step  in  the  process  is  to  measure  the  starting  dimensions  of  the  clay  brick  samples.

   Using  the  same  approach  as  Mensinga  (2009),  the  minimum  strain  measurement  of  the  clay   brick  samples  is  determined  by  the  tolerance  of  the  instruments  used  for  measurements.  That   is,  0.00381  mm  tolerance  of  the  large  micrometer,  and  0.00254  mm  for  the  medium   micrometer,  are  considered  the  amount  of  expansion  required  before  being  recognized  as  frost   dilatometry  expansion.  This  equates  to  approximately  100  microstrain.  Strain  measurements   occurring  in  the  Z-axis  of  the  10  mm  thick  specimens  was  abandoned:  the  amount  of  strain  that   occurs  is  too  small  to  measure  with  this  type  of  equipment.  Also,  accuracy  was  hindered  along   the  thin  width  dimension,  due  to  the  lack  space  to  install  wear  pins  into  the  sample  in  this   dimension.  The  rotating  action  of  the  closing  micrometer  callipers  provided  enough  abrasion   against  the  soft  sandstone-like  characteristic  of  the  historic  clay  brick,  to  slightly  wear  the   59  

   surface  away  at  each  measurement.  Wear  pins  were  not  embedded  into  10  mm  dimension   because  they  require  at  least  3  mm  of  depth.  Had  they  been  installed,  there  would  only  have   been  approximately  4  mm  of  clay  brick  between  the  pins  for  frost  dilatometry  measurement.        Each  micrometer  measurement  is  taken  twice:  once  in  a  forward  direction  (Figure  33),  once  in   a  reverse  direction,  and  then  averaged.  This  approach  helps  eliminates  measurement  error,   both  user  error  and  instrument  error.  Great  care  must  also  be  taken  to  position  each  pin  at  the   very  center  of  the  calliper  anvils  when  measuring  specimen  length  in  order  to  minimize  user   error  (Refer  to  Figure  33,  Figure  34  and  Figure  35).  This  approach  helps  ensure  repeatable   measurements.  Otherwise,  measuring  the  span  between  pins  with  the  callipers  off-centre   would  introduce  a  measurement  angle  that  is  not  a  perfect  right  angle  between  the  pins.  Even   if  the  wear  pins  are  not  installed  at  perfect  right  angles  to  into  the  clay  brick,  they  can  still   produce  repeatable  measurements  when  measured  at  the  centre  of  the  micrometer  anvils.

   peristaltic  pump  in  order  to  achieve  the  deepest  vacuum.  A  vacuum  of  -94  KPa  (7.35  KPa   absolute  pressure)  (-27.75  inHg)  is  achieved  using  this  method  (Figure  43).  The  vacuum  is   maintained  for  30  minutes  and  then  the  vacuum  desiccator  vessel  is  inverted,  allowing  the  dry   clay  brick  specimens  to  be  submerged  under  the  distilled  water  inside  the  vessel.  The  valve  on   the  desiccator  vessel  is  then  opened;  air  re-enters  the  vessel  and  re-pressurizes  the  inside  of   the  vessel  back  to  that  of  atmospheric  pressure.  In  the  process,  evacuated  pores  within  the  clay   brick  are  completely  filled  with  water,  pushed  in  by  atmospheric  pressure.  Specimens  are   immediately  removed  from  the  vessel,  wiped  with  a  damp  cloth,  and  weighed.

   5.2.1.6  CRITICAL  SATURATION  POINT  ANALYSIS      Once  the  minimum  and  maximum  water  saturation  points  are  known  for  each  specimen,  the   freeze-thaw  testing  is  performed  to  determine  the  critical  saturation  point,  Scrit  Â­  the  point  at   which  the  specimen  experiences  frost  dilatometry.  Before  the  brick  specimens  are  saturated,   each  specimen  must  be  dimensioned  across  the  installed  wear  pins  and  recorded.  Specimens   are  measured  twice,  at  the  centre-points  of  the  micrometer  callipers,  and  the  average  of  the   two  measurements  must  be  used.  The  specimens  are  then  saturated  with  water  to:  20%,  40%,   60%  80%  and  100%  of  their  maximum.  Water  is  added  to  specimens  with  an  eyedropper   where  under  60%  saturation  is  desired.  Samples  requiring  greater  saturation  than  60%  must   be  saturated  beyond  the  desired  amount  by  either  boil  or  vacuum  saturation  methods,  and   then  dried  to  the  desired  level  of  saturation.  Once  achieved,  the  specimens  are  wrapped  in   multiple  layers  of  plastic  cling  wrap,  and  then  in  layers  of  aluminum  foil  to  prevent  moisture   from  escaping.  Clay  brick  specimens  are  then  left  to  sit  to  allow  the  water  to  equally  distribute   throughout  for  a  period  of  24  hours.     Once  the  24  hour  distribution  period  had  passed,  the  specimens  are  placed  into  an  automatic   freeze-thaw  chamber.  The  chamber  automatically  cycles  between  freezing  and  thawing  every   12  hours:  each  freeze  cycle  is  12  hour  in  duration,  and  drops  beyond  -30Â°C.  The  freeze  cycle  is   followed  by  a  12  hour  thaw  period  where  the  temperature  inside  the  freeze-thaw  chamber   reaches  +30Â°C  (Refer  to  Figure  44).  A  total  of  9  freeze-thaw  cycles  are  performed  on  each   specimen.  Previous  work  by  Peter  Mensinga  exposed  the  brick  specimens  to  6  cycles  of  freeze   thaw  (Mensinga,  2009).  Since  this  equipment  for  cycling  freeze  -thaw  is  automatic,  a  few  extra   cycles  have  been  added  in  an  attempt  to  make  any  dilatometry  occurring  in  the  specimens   more  evident.   68

Specimens  are  placed  flat  directly  onto  the  refrigerated  shelves  of  the  freeze-thaw  chamber,  so   that  the  maximum  surface  area  of  the  specimen  is  in  contact  with  shelves  where  the  cooling   lines  were  located  (Figure  45).  During  the  cooling  cycle,  the  samples  are  chilled  by  a   combination  of  conductive  heat  flow  to  the  shelves,  and  convection  within  the  chamber.  During   the  heating  cycle,  the  specimens  are  warmed  convectively  by  a  small  heater-fan  that  circulates   warm  air  throughout  the  chamber.  Once  the  9  freeze-thaw  cycles  complete,  specimens  are   removed  from  the  chamber,  dimensioned  with  the  micrometers  in  both  directions  and  the   average  measurement  taken.  Measurements  are  logged  into  a  spreadsheet,  and  analysed.

This  process  for  freeze-thaw  differs  from  that  outlined  in  the  procedure  for  ASTM  C67,  which   calls  for  the  brick  specimens  to  be  partially  submerged  in  a  bath  of  water  during  the  freeze- thaw  cycles.  This  step  is  not  possible  when  testing  for  frost  dilatometry.  When  narrowing  in  on   the  critical  saturation  point  of  a  specimen,  the  precisely  measured  amount  of  water  it  contains   must  be  known  when  freeze-thaw  expansion  begins  to  occur.

   5.2.2  ABSORPTION  CURVE  VALUE  DETERMINATION      The  initial  rate  of  absorption,  or  the  A-value,  is  an  important  piece  of  information:  it  identifies   how  quickly  water  moisture  transfers  though  a  porous  medium  by  way  of  capillary  suction,   and  is  a  necessary  value  for  producing  a  precise  WUFI  computer  model.  For  this  measurement,   oven  dried  bricks  are  allowed  to  cool.  The  bricks  are  stood  on  one  end  so  that  the  end  in  a   shallow  bath  of  water.  Racks  are  position  to  support  the  brick,  so  that  only  the  end  face  comes   in  contact  with  the  water,  and  the  brick  is  not  submerged  more  than  approximately  3   millimeters.  The  A-value  water  uptake  is  only  measured  in  one  dimension  along  the  width  of   two  full  brick  units,  and  one  half-width  brick  specimen.  The  brick  is  removed  from  the  bath   every  minute,  the  wet  surface  is  wiped  with  a  damp  cloth,  the  brick  is  weighed,  and  then   quickly  put  back  in  the  bath  where  it  continues  to  uptake  water  for  another  minute.  The   measurement  cycle  is  repeated  until  enough  data  has  been  recorded  to  create  a  curve.  The   procedure  for  determining  the  A-value  of  bricks  are  outlined  in  CSA-A82-06  (CSA  Standards,   2007)  and  in  ASTM  C67-13  (ASTM,  2014b).

   5.2.3  CORRELATING  MOISTURE  CONTENT  TO  RELATIVE  HUMIDITY      Precisely  correlating  the  moisture  content  of  the  SMT  wooden  moisture  content  sensors  to  the   M.C.  of  the  clay  brick  is  performed  in  the  lab.  It  should  be  noted  that  only  a  limited  number  of   bricks  are  available  for  testing.  Of  the  bricks  extracted  from  the  walls,  a  total  of  5  beige  bricks   and  8  red  bricks  were  undamaged  and  suitable  for  laboratory  analysis.  (Several  bricks   extracted  from  the  walls  were  discarded  due  to  fissures  and  voids  in  the  clay.)  The  remaining   bricks  were  divided  up  amongst  the  various  sections  of  lab  work  for  this  project.  A  single  red   clay  brick  (upper  wall)  and  a  single  beige  clay  brick  (foundation),  chosen  at  random,  are  used   for  this  portion  of  the  analysis,  to  correlate  the  R.H.  to  M.C.  data.  A  brick  of  each  type  was   chosen  to  identify  what  effect  the  type  of  brick  might  have  on  correlating  the  moisture  content   to  the  relative  humidity.  Any  measurement  error  resulting  from  the  inhomogeneous   constitution  of  the  clay  brick  may  be  offset  by  the  large  size  of  the  SMT  Moisture  Content   sensors.  Figure  46  and  Figure  47  show  examples  of  clay  brick  with  visible  signs  of   inhomogeneity:  marbling  within  the  clay,  as  well  as  inclusions  and  air  pockets  can  be  seen.  The   12.7  mm  diameter  by  65  mm  depth  of  the  borehole  for  the  sensors  requires  a  relatively  large   amount  of  surface  area  for  the  Moisture  Content  sensor  to  make  contact,  inside  of  the  clay   brick,  and  bisects  multiple  zones  of  clay  brick  composition.

   Clay  bricks  are  chosen  based  on  their  appearance;  they  are  cut  in  half  to  reduce  them  to  a   manageable  size,  and  also  to  make  visible  their  inner  composition.  The  two  clay  bricks  chosen   for  this  portion  of  the  analysis  do  not  appear  to  have  any  cracks  or  damage,  and  appear  be   representative  samples.     73  

   A  controlled  relative  humidity  environment  is  achieved  inside  an  airtight  vessel  by  using  water   and  supersaturated  salt  solutions.  Different  types  of  salts,  when  mixed  in  a  supersaturated   solution,  create  stable  and  documented  RH  levels  (Wexler  &  Hasegawa,  1954).  For  safety   reasons,  only  Potassium  Carbonate  and  table  salt  are  used  to  obtain  mid-range  levels  of   humidity  (Refer  to  Table  3).  A  variety  of  other  salts  can  produce  a  range  of  RH  levels,  however   many  are  listed  as  hazardous  through  the  Workplace  Hazardous  Material  Information  System   (WHMIS),  and  the  benefit  of  additional  relative  humidities  inside  the  control  chamber  was   unnecessary  and  would  have  required  the  use  of  an  updraft  (OSHA,  2001).

   To  ensure  the  salts  are  properly  in  a  super  saturated  solution,  they  must  be  mixed  with  boiling   water  and  allowed  to  cool.  The  extra  salt  crystalizes  out  of  the  solutions  as  the  liquids  cool.  The   crystalized  salts  remain  at  the  bottoms  of  the  solutions  in  a  solid  state.  Maintaining  this  extra   solid  salt  is  crucial  to  creating  a  stable  RH  inside  a  sealed  vessel.     First,  gravimetric  analysis  is  performed  on  the  clay  bricks  in  the  vessel  without  the  sensor  in   place  so  that  the  clay  bricks  can  be  accurately  weighed  without  the  interference  from  weight  of   any  attached  sensor  cable.  The  salt  solution  is  placed  in  the  bottom  of  the  airtight  vessel  (Refer   to  Figure  48).  The  clay  brick  (without  sensor)  is  then  placed  in  the  same  container,  on  top  of  a   rack,  which  keeps  the  clay  brick  elevated  above  the  salt  solution.  An  OnSet  U10   temperature/RH  data  logger  is  also  placed  inside  the  vessel  to  monitor  the  humidity

   conditions.  The  U10  is  wired  to  a  computer  so  that  conditions  can  be  monitored  without   disturbing  the  measurement  by  opening  the  vessel.

Both  clay  brick  types  were  allowed  to  acclimatize  over  each  salt  solution  listed  in  Table  3  for   over  one  week.  After  a  seven-day  period,  the  vessel  was  opened,  and  the  clay  brick  specimens   were  weighed.        The  next  step  requires  repeating  the  above  procedure,  but  with  the  moisture  content  sensor   installed  in  each  clay  brick.  A  12.7  mm  (1/2")  hole  is  drilled  squarely  into  the  face  near  a   corner  of  the  clay  brick  to  a  depth  of  75  mm  (3").  The  hole  is  positioned  near  a  corner  such  that   the  outside  diameter  of  the  hole  is  approximately  6  mm  (1/4")  from  the  faces  of  two  sides  of   the  clay  brick  (Figure  48).  The  intention  of  positioning  the  sensor  close  to  the  edge  is  to  speed   the  measurement  time,  by  reducing  the  distance  through  the  clay  brick  that  moisture  must   travel  to  reach  the  sensor.  The  distance  between  the  wall  of  the  borehole  and  any  brick  face  is   kept  at  a  distance  greater  than  6  mm  in  order  to  prevent  the  soft  and  brittle  100-yearold  clay   brick  from  cracking.

   Dust  from  the  clay  brick  drilling  process  is  saved  and  reused  as  an  intermediate  medium  to   tightly  bridge  the  sensor  to  the  wall  of  the  borehole  for  each  respective  clay  brick.   Approximately  1  cc  of  clay  brick  dust  is  placed  into  the  bottom  of  the  borehole.  Once  the  sensor   is  inserted,  more  clay  brick  dust  is  placed  on  top.  A  combination  of  tamping,  taping  and   vibrating  is  performed  to  pack  the  dust  in  tightly.  Once  complete,  the  sensor  hole  is  topped  off   with  epoxy  to  seal  all  the  components  in  place,  and  to  prevent  water  vapour  from  simply   entering  the  sensor  through  the  top.   Cables  for  both  the  M.C.  sensor  and  the  temperature/RH  data  logger  are  routed  out  of  a  hole  in   the  vessel  (and  sealed  airtight  with  sealant).  Conditions  can  be  monitored  in  real-time  without   disrupting  the  measurement  (Figure  48).  As  before,  each  clay  brick  is  placed  inside  the  sealed   vessel,  above  the  super  saturated  salt  solution.  The  two  cables  exiting  the  sealed  vessel  are  for   a  U10  temperature/RH  and  a  SMT  Moisture  Content  sensor,  are  connected  to  a  PC  computer   and  a  SMT  data  logger,  respectively.

   The  east  wall  was  divided  into  two  gigapixel  images,  as  the  size  and  similarity  of  all  the   individual  photos  which  make  up  these  gigapixel  images  were  pushing  the  limits  of  the   software.  In  Figure  49,  the  upper  photo  is  the  upper  portion  of  the  wall,  and  the  lower  photo  is   the  lower  portion  of  the  wall  where  it  meets  grade.  Note  the  the  grey  vertical  lines  in  the  upper   portion  of  the  image:  these  are  the  uprights  of  the  scafolding  that  were  caught  in  the  perifery  of   the  individual  photos  before  stitching.  The  void  area  in  the  centre  of  image  "East02"  is  the   location  of  the  wall  mounted  air  conditioning  condenser;  because  it  was  not  along  the  same   plane  as  the  brick  faces,  the  paralax  prevented  the  images  being  stitched  together  in  this  area.   The  siding  of  the  third  storey  addition  are  directly  above  image  "East02."  All  high-resolution   imagry  are  available  for  download  at  the  website  for  the  toronto  test  house.  In  an  internet   browser,  go  to:  http://renovation2050.wix.com/renovation2050#  and  navigate  to  the  "Brick   Study"  section  of  the  website.  With  the  high  resolution  gigapixel  imagry  from  the  website,   images  can  be  zoomed  in  upon  to  reveal  the  sand-like  texture  of  the  clay  brick  units  and   mortar  joints.     These  photographs  reveal  quite  interesting  weathering  characteristics.  The  left  third  of  the   images  (south  end)  shows  the  bricks  are  dirty  and  the  mortar  joints  are  weathered.  This   portion  of  the  wall  does  not  have  a  neighboring  building  directly  adjacent.  Conversly,  the  right   two-thirds  of  the  photos  (north  end)  show  the  bricks  appearing  almost  "salmon"  in  colour,  and   are  not  weathered  to  the  extent  of  the  south  end.  This  north  portion  of  the  east  elevation  has   been  partially  sheltered  by  the  neighboring  house  which  is  less  that  1  m  away.  Also  the  eaves   of  the  two  houses  providing  considerable  shelter  from  the  elements  in  this  area  as  they  overlap   in  along  their  length.  Sensor  location  "P"  is  essentially  in  the  centre  of  this  protected  area  of   wall.  The  visual  reviewed  condition  of  the  wall  at  this  location  generally  reflects  the  

78  

   measurements  recorded  by  the  moisture  content  senors  at  this  location.  The  wall  is  able  to  dry,   especially  at  the  exterior  surface.     The  entire  length  of  brick  wall  at  grade  appears  damp,  and  is  exhibiting  some  signs  of   deterioration,  with  the  brick  unit  faces  spawling  at  a  few  locations  in  a  line  approximately  1  m   above  grade.  The  foundaton  brick  is  beige,  and  changes  to  red  brick  approximately  0.5  m  above   grade.  However  this  interface  is  not  easily  visible,  due  to  years  of  dampness  in  this  zone,  which   has  caused  years  of  soil  and  pollution  to  stick  to  the  area.  Moisture  from  below  grade  is   wicking  up  through  the  foundation  wall,  and  is  drying  at  the  brick  masonry  surface  above   grade.  There  are  a  dozen  or  so  bricks  at  the  top  of  this  band  on  the  east  elevation  which  have   spalled  faces.  Because  the  spall  is  isolated  to  this  high  moisture  band,  the  damage  could  be  a   result  of  ground  salt  and  minerals  being  drawn  through  foundation  wall,  which  cause  the   bricks  to  spawl  as  the  minerals  deposit  beneath  the  brick  surface  as  the  moisture  dries.  The   sensors  at  location  "Q"  were  installed  in  this  damp  region  in  the  centre  of  the  east  wall,  and   confirm  damp  conditions,  particularly  in  the  interior  wythe  of  the  of  brick  masonry  wall.  This   topics  is  discussed  further  in  the  Moisture  Content  sensor  results  in  section  6.2.1  Sensor  Data  Â­   Labels  and  Definitions.

The  north  elevation  is  only  photo  journaled  at  the  second  storey  above  the  veranda  roof.  The   windows  have  been  digitally  masked  out  in  order  to  help  the  software  stitch  the  individual   photos  together.  Clay  brick  masonry  at  the  first  storey  of  the  north  elevation  were  obscured  by   porch  furniture  and  were  not  included  in  the  gigapixel  portion  of  this  paper.  The  brick  at  the   north  elevation,  especially  where  it  is  covered  and  protected,  is  very  dry.  Sensor  location  "R"  is   located  in  the  first  storey  wall  near  the  centre  of  the  porch,  and  confirms  this  is  a  wall  with  a   relatively  low  mositure  content  with  respect  to  the  other  locations  around  the  house.

The  west  elevation  was  visually  reviewed  and  photo  journaled  with  gigapixel  imagery,   however  sensors  were  not  installed  at  this  elevation.  The  wall  is  very  damp,  and  in  image   "West02"  in  Figure  51,  a  green  line  of  algae  growth  is  visible.  The  south  end  of  the  building   steps  back  away  from  the  neighboring  building  ("West08"  to  "West10"  in  Figure  51)  and  the   brick  shows  a  more  weathered  appearance,  as  it  is  less  protected  from  the  elements;  this  same   phenomenon  occured  on  the  east  elevation  as  the  west.

   6.1.4  SOUTH  ELEVATION      The  south  elevation  has  very  little  exposed  brick:  an  addition  to  the  south  end  of  the  house  at   the  first  floor  covers  all  the  original  exposed  brick  at  this  level.  The  second  storey  has  some  of   the  original  brick  exposed,  however  this  portion  of  wall  is  primarily  window  fenestration;   there  is  not  enough  brick  area  for  the  photo-stitching  software  to  successfully  match  enough   converging  pixels  within  the  images  to  make  a  successful  rendering.  The  brick  at  the  second   storey  south  elevation  are  therefore  best  shown  with  a  few  full  regular  camera  images.  The   third  storey  at  this  south  end  of  the  house  is  new;  this  upper  addition  is  clad  with  clapboards   and  has  no  exposed  brick.

   6.1.5  ALL  PHOTO  STITCH  WORK      Stitching  the  photographs  together  into  larger  images  for  this  particular  application  is  not  a   simple  task.  Given  the  state  of  current  photo-stitching  technology  available,  the  process  of   merging  high-resolution  photographs  is  extremely  time  consuming  and  involves  continuously   coaxing  the  software  into  producing  the  desired  outcome.  The  problem  is  that  this  type  of   application  is  not  well  suited  to  the  software,  which  was  likely  never  intended  for  this  purpose.   The  software  is  designed  for  stitching  together  panoramic  photographs  of  scenes  differing  in   colours,  textures,  and  also  with  photos  taken  from  a  single  camera  position.  For  this  project,   the  image  stitching  software  was  used  to  stitch  together  hundreds  images,  which  all  essentially   looked  the  same.  They  all  shared  the  same  pattern  (brick  and  mortar  joints)  but  with  every   photo  containing  subtle  differences  in  colour,  shades  and  texture.  Also,  the  photos  were  taken   in  a  linear  fashion  by  moving  the  camera  along  a  plane.  Since  the  software  looks  for  similar   points  between  the  different  images,  the  software  would  often  erroneously  identify  control   points  that  did  not  actually  exist  between  photographs.  It  would  link  together  individual   photographs  that  it  thought  were  portions  of  the  same  position  on  the  elevation,  but  in  fact   were  not.  The  result  was  a  mosaic  of  photos  that  were  not  stitched  together  in  linear  fashion  Â­   the  software  had  a  tendency  to  attempt  to  bend  the  photographs  in  a  sort  of  4-dimensional   nonsensical  assembly.  A  great  deal  of  manual  control-point  editing  was  required  to  create   these  large  images.       In  the  end,  it  was  possible  to  create  the  large  giga-pixel  images  of  areas  of  the  elevations.  The   benefits  of  this  approach  are  evident  as  discussed  in  the  above  Sections  and  could  serve  as  an   excellent  method  to  provide  visual  reference  for  exterior  cladding  in  the  future,  however,  

83  

   currently  the  effort  required  to  do  so  is  substantial  considering  current  technology  and  this   method  should  be  evaluated  on  a  project  specific  basis.

   Moisture  Content  Sensor  Measurements   At  four  locations  around  the  house,  the  moisture  content  sensors  are  positioned  at  three   depths  within  the  brick  masonry  portion  of  the  envelope:  one  is  in  the  exterior  wythe,  the   second  is  at  the  collar  joint,  and  the  third  at  each  location  is  in  the  interior  wythe  of  brick.  The   measurement  trend  lines  are  generally  stratified  and  follow  each  other.  When  compared  to  the   exterior  wythe  moisture  content  measurements,  there  is  generally  a  delay  in  the  collar  joint   measurement,  and  even  more  of  a  delay  of  the  interior  wythe  measurement.  This  is  a  result  of   the  time  it  takes  for  moisture  to  travel  through  the  pores  of  the  brick  masonry  envelope  after  a   rain  event.  The  sensor  measurements  show  that  the  moisture  content  sensor  in  the  exterior   wythe  can  respond  to  moisture  from  a  rain  even  in  only  a  few  hours  (Refer  to  Figure  53).  But   for  the  interior  wythe  Moisture  Content  Sensor,  it  can  take  several  days  to  respond  and  the   reaction  is  less  severe  (Refer  to  MC  measurements  in  Figure  53,  Figure  54,  Figure  55  and   Figure  56).  This  demonstrates  the  time  it  takes  for  moisture  to  transfer  from  the  exterior  face   of  the  clay  brick  by  way  of  capillary  suction.  What  is  unknown  is  the  additional  time  it  takes  for   the  moisture  to  travel  from  the  brick  to  the  Moisture  Content  sensor  by  way  of  vapour   diffusion.  However,  because  the  wooden  Moisture  Content  sensors  are  at  least  in  partial   contact  with  the  boreholes  in  which  they  have  been  inserted,  and  the  then  tightly  packed  with   brick  dust,  at  least  a  partial  path  for  moisture  to  travel  to  the  sensors  by  way  of  capillary   suction  exists.  Note  that  the  exterior  RH  measurement  reached  a  ceiling  of  approximate  92%   for  two  days  (Refer  to  Figure  53).  This  is  most  likely  caused  by  a  wind  blown  rain/snow  event,   with  water  coming  into  contact  with  the  surface-mounted  sensor  on  the  east  elevation.  The   92%  RH  measured  by  the  instrument  is  the  maximum  it  measures,  and  the  length  of  the   plateau  indicates  that  it  was  wet  for  several  days.

   Moisture  content  measurements  at  the  east  wall  reveal  very  different  measurements   depending  on  the  height  of  the  sensors  (Refer  to  Figure  57  and  Figure  58).  A  possible   explanation  for  the  greater  moisture  content  measurement  at  the  low-positioned  interior   wythe  sensor  is  that  ground  moisture  could  wicking  up  through  the  foundation  wall.   Reviewing  the  gigapixel  image  of  the  east  elevation  (from  section  6.1.1  East  Elevation)  shows   the  wall  is  visibly  darker  from  moisture  along  its  entire  length.  Because  the  outer  wythe  is   exposed  to  air,  it  is  able  to  dry  more  so  than  the  interior  wythe.  The  corridor  on  the  east  side  of   the  Toronto  test  house  has  a  slight  negative  slope  toward  the  house;  during  rain  events,  water   is  promoted  to  flow  toward  the  foundation  wall.  Given  this  high  level  of  moisture  in  the  brick   masonry  wall  near  grade,  it  can  become  a  critical  location  when  adding  insulation  to  the   interior.  The  amount  of  any  insulation  should  be  judiciously  placed  so  not  to  decrease  the   drying  potential  of  the  clay  brick  masonry  along  the  grade  of  the  building,  and  also  deter  the   brick  along  the  grade  from  freezing  in  the  winter.  Alternatively,  the  home  Owner  should   consider  re-sloping  the  concrete  walk  way  to  direct  water  away  from  the  brick  at  the  wall's   base.      It  should  be  noted  that  not  all  rain  events  are  alike.  The  direction  of  the  wind  was  not  included   with  the  precipitation  graph,  but  it  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  amount  of  moisture  the   wall  is  absorbs.  A  heavy  rain  event  may  not  deposit  much  moisture  on  an  exterior  wall  if  there   is  little  wind,  however  a  light  rain  may  soak  a  wall  if  the  wind  is  coming  from  the  right   direction.  Figure  61  shows  this  situation  occurring  at  the  Toronto  test  house.  A  heavy  rain   event  causes  a  spike  in  the  precipitation  measurement,  while  causing  the  moisture  content  to   climb  to  approximately  6%  M.C.  before  the  trend  plateaus.  A  subsequent  smaller  rain  event   99  

   causes  the  moisture  content  to  increase  significantly,  likely  as  a  result  of  wind  load,  before  the   trend  plateaus  around  15%  M.C.

   Freeze-Thaw  Cycles   Cycles  of  freeze-thaw  were  tallied  from  data  measured  by  the  exterior  wall  temperature/RH   sensors,  and  the  temperature  component  of  the  moisture  content  sensors  installed  within  both   wythes  of  brick  masonry.  Table  4  summarises  the  measurements  recorded  over  one  winter.   Technical  issues  with  the  instrumentation  prevented  some  temperature  measurements  at  the   East  wall  sensor  location,  3  metres  above  grade,  however  the  temperature  conditions  at  the   east  wall  are  very  close  to  those  of  the  East  wall  at  the  0.5  metre  high  sensor  position,  as   shown  in  Table  4.  The  south  elevation  reveals  the  most  number  of  freeze-thaw  cycles  by  far,   logging  approximately  51  cycles  in  the  exterior  wythe  of  brick  masonry  between  December  11   and  April  15.  The  greatest  number  of  freeze-thaw  cycles  on  the  south  elevation  is  to  be   expected:  daily  solar  heat  gains  can  thaw  out  the  wall  during  daylight  and  between  passing   storms  and  clouds.  The  additional  cycles  observed  on  the  south  elevation  (compared  to  the   east  and  west  elevations)  quantify  the  increase  attributed  to  solar  exposure.  At  night  or  when   the  sun  is  not  heating  the  brick  surfaces  of  the  walls  can  dip  below  the  freezing  point.

T ABLE   4:    F REEZE - THAW  CYCLES  MEASURED  OVER  ONE  WINTER   (2012/2013):  

   In  the  city  of  Toronto,  north  elevations  are  not  exposed  to  solar  radiation  in  the  winter.  There   are  no  solar  heat  gains  on  the  north  elevation  of  the  Toronto  test  house  in  the  winter.   (Toronto's  city  survey  is  not  aligned  with  true  north;  inspecting  any  map  reveals  the  city  plan   is  rotated  almost  15Â°  counter-clockwise  from  true  north.  As  a  result,  the  "north"  elevations  of   buildings  in  the  city  are  slightly  west  facing,  and  can  receive  afternoon  solar  radiation  during   the  height  of  summer.)  At  the  east  elevation  where  the  sensors  are  positioned,  the   neighbouring  house  and  the  tunnel-like  corridor  also  prevent  much  solar  radiation  from   heating  the  brick  masonry  wall.  Solar  radiation  only  reaches  the  corridor  for  a  brief  period,  and   hits  the  wall  at  an  acute  angle.  As  a  result  there  is  very  little  heating  of  the  majority  of  the  east   elevation  from  solar  radiation.  As  a  result,  the  totalled  freeze-thaw  cycles  within  the  exterior   wythes  of  brick  on  the  north  and  east  elevation  are  approximate  the  same  at  17  cycles  for  each   location  in  the  winter  of  2012/2013.

   6.3  FROST  DILATOMETRY  RESULTS  Â­  GENERAL  NOTES      Plotted  below  are  the  results  of  the  clay  brick  frost  dilatometry  data  collected  from  a  number   of  clay  bricks  that  were  extracted  from  the  walls  of  the  Toronto  test  house.  Graphs  are  grouped   by  the  clay  brick  specimens  from  which  they  were  cut.  Specimens  were  saturated  to  a   percentage  of  their  maximum  moisture  content,  which  was  determined  by  a  combination  of   vacuum  saturation  and  boil  method  saturation.  All  clay  brick  specimens  listed  here  were   exposed  to  9  freeze-thaw  cycles  and  measured  for  expansion  along  two  or  three  axes,   depending  on  the  specimen  size.   The  small  clay  brick  specimens,  approximately  100  mm  x  63  mm  x  10  mm  were  measured  for   dilatometry  expansion  along  2  dimensions.  In  the  graphs  below,  the  100  mm  dimension  is   labelled  as  "X-Axis."  The  63  mm  dimension  is  labelled  as  "Y-Axis."  Expansion  along  the  10  mm   thickness  ("Z-Axis")  of  the  specimen  is  not  included  in  this  paper,  as  expansion  was  too  small   to  reliably  measure  with  the  equipment  available.   Modern  clay  brick  from  Hanson  Brick  run  as  a  comparison  to  the  historic  century  clay  brick,   but  could  not  be  cut  into  specimens  in  the  same  manner  because  the  modern  clay  brick  units   contain  3  larges  cores  instead  of  a  frog.  As  a  result,  each  clay  brick  could  only  yield  4  specimens   to  be  analyzed  for  freeze-thaw  expansion.  Graphs  grouped  by  clay  brick  each  possessing  four   specimen  data  points  do  not  warrant  the  insertion  of  a  trend  line.  These  graphs  are  included   for  comparison  purposes  only.     The  larger  100  mm  x  100  mm  x  63  mm  specimens  were  measured  for  frost  dilatometry   expansion  across  all  three  dimensions.  Clay  bricks  were  halved  to  yield  2  specimens.  The  "X- Axis"  measurements  refer  to  the  100  mm  dimension  parallel  to  the  frog  (the  width).  The  "Y- 105  

   Axis"  measurements  refer  to  the  100  mm  dimension  perpendicular  to  the  frog  (the  depth).  The   "Z-Axis"  measurement  refers  to  the  63  mm  dimension  of  the  clay  brick  (the  height).   Below,  graphs  show  all  expansion  measurement  data  points  for  bricks  tested  for  frost   dilatometry.  Where  data  points  may  be  within  the  Scrit  realm  (on  the  right  side  of  each  graph)  a   trend  line  has  been  added  to  help  demonstrate  the  critical  saturation  point.  The  critical   saturation  point  is  close  to  where  the  trend  line  intercepts  0  Expansion  on  the  Y-axis  of  the   graph;  it  is  an  Microsoft  Excel  generated  trend  line  based  on  the  average  slope  of  the  data   points  in  the  80%  to  100%  saturation  region  of  the  graphs.

   6.3.4  DISCUSSION      The  majority  of  the  critical  saturation  points  of  the  2-axes  specimens  fall  into   approximately  the-80%  range.  Scrit  frost  dilatometry  results,  brick  porosity  and  brick   density  results  are  listed  below  (Table  5).

   Because  the  3-dimesnional  (3  axis)  measurements  had  to  be  performed  on  specimens  thick   enough  to  be  able  to  measure  expansion  with  micrometers,  half-clay  brick  samples  (100   mm  x  100  mm  x  64  mm)  were  used.  The  problem  this  posed  was  by  not  being  able  to  slice   the  clay  bricks  into  many  specimens,  a  very  limited  quantity  were  available  to  be  exposed   to  cycles  of  frost  dilatometry.  Efforts  were  focuses  on  measuring  how  evenly  frost   dilatometry  occurred  in  these  larger  specimens  when  they  were  exposed  to  9  cycles  of   freeze-thaw  while  being  saturated  beyond  the  critical  saturation  point.  These  specimens  

126  

   were  saturated  to  various  levels  between  70%  and  85%  of  their  maximum  moisture   content,  just  within  the  critical  saturation  region  for  these  bricks.  The  results  revealed  that   these  clay  brick  specimens  did  not  expand  uniformly  at  all.  Given  this  level  of  saturation,   the  specimens  cracked  and  disintegrated  to  a  degree  (Figure  96,  Figure  97  and  Figure  98);   they  suffered  great  expansion  in  some  direction  and  also  shrinkage  along  other  axes.

   Saturation  of  Clay  Brick   The  vacuum  saturation  method  and  the  boil  saturation  method  had  small  differences.  For  the   most  part,  the  vacuum  method  produced  a  greater  saturation  level,  on  average  2%  better  than   the  boil  method.  There  was  the  odd  exception  with  specimens  from  four  clay  brick  specimens,   which  saw  a  2%  better  saturation  using  the  boil  method  (Table  6).  This  may  be  attributed  to   pore  characteristics  in  these  particular  specimens.  Mensinga  (2009)  was  able  to  produce  a   vacuum  of  -100.2  KPa  (-29.6  inHg)  using  a  superior  vacuum  pump;  the  -94.0  (-27.75  inHg)  that   was  produced  by  our  equipment  may  not  have  been  sufficient.  Mensinga  (2009)  used  only  the   vacuum  saturation  method,  so  did  not  have  boil  saturation  results  to  compare  against.  It   should  be  noted  that  the  5-hour  boil  test  is  still  an  approved  method  for  clay  brick  specimen   saturation  according  to  the  CSA  and  ASTM.  Any  greater  water  saturation  of  the  specimen   achieved  beyond  the  boil  method  is  a  bonus.  For  this  research  project,  the  greater  of  the  two   saturation  levels  was  taken  to  be  the  maximum.  The  differential  of  the  dry  specimen  weight   and  the  saturated  specimen  weight  is  the  weight  of  the  water  that  the  specimen  can  hold.  -- This  is  the  weight  of  water  that  can  be  held  within  the  pores  of  a  clay  brick.  The  volume  of  the   open  pore  structure  within  the  clay  brick  specimen  can  be  easily  determined,  given  the  known   density  of  water.

   Some  of  the  higher  moisture  content  values  measured  by  the  in-situ  moisture  content  sensors   are  in  the  area  of  15-16%  M.C.  for  red  brick.  When  these  values  are  related  to  the  moisture   storage  curve  (refer  to  Figure  102  and  Figure  103),  the  actual  moisture  content  of  the  brick  is   revealed  to  be  approximately  29%  M.C.  Â­  less  than  half  the  value  of  the  critical  saturation  point   129  

   of  the  brick  for  the  Toronto  test  house  (which  is  in  the  area  of  60%  to  80%  M.C.  as  presented  in   Section  6.3.1  Plotted  Results  of  2-Dimensional  Frost  Dilatometry).  The  moisture  content  of   brick  at  the  locations  of  the  moisture  content  sensors  is  well  below  the  critical  saturation   point.  There  is  greater  risk  of  the  clay  brick  reaching  the  critical  saturation  point  at  grade,   where  the  pooling  water  can  saturate  a  brick  as  thoroughly  as  "the  24  hour  natural  saturation   method"  performed  in  the  lab,  which  could  saturate  brick  to  approximately  60%  of  their   maximum  moisture  content.  Combined  with  the  17  freeze-thaw  cycles  experienced  at  the  east   and  north  elevation,  or  the  50  freeze-thaw  cycles  at  the  south  elevation,  there  does  exist  the   potential  for  freeze  thaw  damage.  Even  with  this  being  the  case,  very  little  freeze-thaw  damage   is  currently  evident  on  any  of  the  brick  where  they  interface  with  grade.  The  Toronto  test   house  is  built  on  sandy  loam,  so  there  is  very  good  drainage  around  the  building.  It  is  likely   that  the  water  around  the  building  doesn't  sit  around  long  enough  to  saturate  the  clay  brick  at   the  base  of  the  house  into  the  60%  to  70%  moisture  content  zone.        One  topic  that  should  be  considered  is  the  degree  of  saturation  that  clay  brick  specimens  must   be  capable  of  withstanding  in  order  to  pass  a  frost  dilatometry  test.  The  real  question  that   arises:  is  it  reasonable  to  saturate  a  clay  brick  beyond  a  saturation  point  that  naturally  occurs?   (I.e.  saturating  clay  brick  specimens  by  the  vacuum  method.)  The  benefit  of  such  a  test  will   lead  to  the  determination  of  a  critical  saturation  point  that  that  can  only  be  obtained  in  a   laboratory.  Testing  for  freeze/thaw  expansion  in  clay  brick  by  saturating  beyond  what  it  would   ever  likely  experience  in  an  as-built  construction

   It  appears  the  Toronto  test  house  is  safe  from  freeze-thaw  damage,  as  the  moisture  content  of   the  brick  is  well  below  its  critical  saturation  point.  But  there  is  a  possibility  that  many  clay   brick  buildings  in  North  American  cities,  including  those  in  Toronto,  may  only  have  survived  as   long  as  they  have  due  to  their  lack  of  insulation.  As  costs  of  energy  increase,  and  as  more   people  add  insulation  to  their  homes  to  reduce  their  heating  costs,  the  effects  of  freeze-thaw   may  become  more  evident.  If  the  building  owners  want  to  maintain  their  structure  and   appearance,  they  should  not  hastily  rush  into  insulating  their  interior  walls.  Care  should  be   taken  into  determining  how  much  insulation  can  be  added  to  these  walls,  otherwise  problems   could  develop  with  moisture  saturated  clay  brick  and  freeze-thaw  damage  occurring  in  severe   weathering  areas  of  North  America.

   Although  the  graphs  in  Figure  99,  Figure  100  and  Figure  101  represent  the  absorption  curve   for  bricks  standing  on  end,  there  are  alternative  faces  on  which  the  absorption  tests  may  be   performed.  CAN/CSA-A82  calls  for  using  the  bed  face  of  the  brick  for  determining  the   absorption  curve.  In  context  of  a  built  wall,  this  would  be  useful  in  determining  how  moisture   flows  vertically  through  a  brick  masonry  wall  assembly,  from  a  source  such  as  a  damp   foundation  wall.   Another  alternative  method  for  measuring  A-value  would  be  to  immerse  the  brick's   weathering  face  (the  face  of  the  brick  exposed  to  the  exterior  side  of  the  building)  into  the  bath   of  water.  In  this  instance,  the  data  obtained  would  be  useful  for  determining  how  water  flows   transversely  thought  a  brick  masonry  wall  assembly,  and  would  be  representative  moisture   taken  on  by  wind  driven  rain  hitting  an  exterior  wall.   For  this  project,  the  bricks  were  measured  on  their  end  so  that  moisture  would  have  to  travel   the  longest  distance,  creating  the  longest  curve  with  respect  to  duration  of  measurement.

   6.5  MOISTURE  CONTENT  TO  RELATIVE  HUMIDITY  CORRELATION  RESULTS      The  experiment  confirmed  that  while  the  relative  humidity  inside  the  vessel  reached  the   desired  level  in  under  2  hours,  the  moisture  content  sensor  embedded  in  the  clay  brick  took   approximately  a  week  to  equilibrate  to  the  moisture  level  inside  the  vessel.     Both  clay  brick  types  were  allowed  to  acclimatize  over  each  salt  solution  (listed  in  Table  3)  for   over  one  week.  After  a  seven-day  period,  the  vessel  was  opened,  and  the  clay  brick  specimens   were  weighed.  The  results  are  listed  in  Table  7.

   The  gravimetric  clay  brick  moisture  content  results  from  Table  7  were  imported  into  WUFI  to   create  an  extrapolated  sorption  isotherm  curve  for  both  brick  types.  The  extrapolated  values   for  the  red  brick  are  listed  in  Table  8  with  the  resulting  sorption  isotherm  curve  shown  in   Figure  102.  The  extrapolated  sorption  values  for  the  beige  brick  are  listed  in  Table  9  with  the   associated  sorption  isotherm  curve  shown  in  Figure  103.  The  sorption  isotherm  curves  of  the   red  brick  and  the  beige  brick  are  very  similar  to  one  another  with  the  exception  of  the   maximum  of  the  curves:  the  beige  brick  has  a  slightly  steeper  slope.     .

Once  the  gravimetric  measurements  were  taken  of  both  brick  types  at  different  humidities,   the  entire  process  was  repeated  with  Moisture  Content  sensors  installed  within  bricks.  The   bricks,  and  sensors  within,  were  sealed  inside  a  vessel  with  a  controlled  relative  humidity,   and  allowed  to  acclimatize  over  a  1-week  period.  The  following  calibration  curves  were   obtained  by  charting  the  gravimetric  moisture  content  against  the  moisture  content  sensor   for  each  type  of  clay  brick  (Refer  to  Figure  104  and  Figure  105).

A  great  deal  of  effort  was  taken  in  developing  the  calibration  relationships  between   gravimetrically  and  sensor-measured  moisture  contents  for  the  beige  and  red  clay  bricks.   However,  the  calibration  curve  does  not  appear  accurate  enough  to  produce  an  actual  brick   moisture  content  prediction  based  on  the  raw  moisture  content  values  from  the  wooden   sensors.  When  the  conversion  formulas  (as  indicated  beside  the  trend  lines  in  Figure  104   and  Figure  105)  were  applied  to  the  raw  moisture  content  data  recorded  by  the  data   loggers,  the  results  did  not  appear  to  calculate  expected  Moisture  Content  values,  especially   around  particular  rain  events  that  should  have  soaked  the  wall.  Table  10  shows  some   "Measured"  (raw)  moisture  content  values,  and  "Actual  Predicted"  (calculated)  values  from   the  formula  for  red  brick  at  sensor  location  "P"  for  three  different  periods  in  time  to  show   different  ranges  of  exterior  temperatures.  The  calculated  M.C.  values  predicted  are  close  to   the  raw  values,  but  not  close  enough  to  be  accurate.  When  the  temperature  is  warm  and  the   138  

   brick  has  relatively  low  moisture  content,  the  calculated  M.C.  values  are  in  the  negatives.   Further  field  research  is  required  with  this  method  in  order  to  develop  the  process  to  a   level  capable  of  being  applied  in  practice.

   The  accuracy  in  these  moisture  content  correction  formulas  remain  in  question,  so  the   safer  choice  for  presenting  the  results  of  this  thesis  is  to  leave  the  moisture  content  sensor   measurements  as  tuned  by  the  supplier,  in  moisture  content  of  the  hemlock  wood  dowel   from  which  they  are  made.     When  using  measured  data  from  the  Onset  equipment,  a  comparison  can  be  made  between   the  measured  RH  and  the  measured  moisture  content  readings  at  a  particular  moment  in   time.  The  corresponding  measurements  in  Figure  106  have  been  chosen  to  compare  

139  

   measurements  between  the  RH  instrumentation  and  the  moisture  content  measuring   equipment;  a  red  vertical  line  indicates  the  point  of  comparison  (at  "2013/2/10").  The  line   is  positioned  near  the  end  of  a  plateau  where  the  exterior  RH  is  relatively  stable,  and  the   exterior  wythe  moisture  content  measurement  is  also  flat.  At  this  point  in  time  the  Relative   humidity  is  measured  to  be  85%  RH,  and  the  moisture  content  is  measured  to  be  3.2%   (raw).  These  measurements  can  be  cross-referenced  with  the  isotherm  curve  in  Figure   102:  at  85%  RH,  the  moisture  content  of  the  brick  should  be  approximately  4  kg/m3  which   is  an  unrealistically  low  value,  given  that  the  red  brick  is  capable  of  holding  roughly  382   kg/m3  during  vacuum  saturation.       There  are  several  possible  reasons  for  the  apparent  error  identified  above.  It  could  be  the   result  of  the  limited  number  of  clay  bricks  used  to  build  the  calibration  curves.  If  this  work   was  to  be  repeated,  calibration  curves  should  be  developed  for  5  or  10  clay  bricks,  and   averaged.  A  single  moisture  content  sensor  is  not  adequate  for  performing  this  task,   especially  given  the  visibly  varying  degree  of  homogeneousness  between  sliced  brick   specimens.  In  order  to  efficiently  benchmark  calibration  curves  to  relative  humidity,   multiple  dedicated  moisture  content  sensors,  as  well  as  instrumentation,  would  be   required.  This  is  recommended  for  future  work  and  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  thesis.

   7.  CONCLUSIONS      The  first  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  if  a  simple  reference  tool  could  be  created   for  the  future  visual  review  of  the  exterior  wall  assemblies.  Using  panoramic  photo- stitching  software,  constructing  large  composites  of  existing-condition  building  elevations   is  possible,  but  it  is  tedious  and  time  consuming.  The  software  used  for  this  project  is  very   powerful,  however  was  not  designed  for  this  particular  application.  As  a  result,  many  hours   were  spent  coaxing  the  program  to  stitch  the  photos  in  a  representative  manner.  Therefore,   other  methods  should  be  explored  such  as  mapping  individual  images  to  a  CAD  elevation   drawing  key  map.  In  the  future,  improvements  in  technology  Â­  both  of  the  photo-stitching   computer  software,  and  of  the  camera  itself,  may  make  it  easier  to  assemble  gigapixel   images  automatically.     The  second  research  question  addressed  whether  or  not  the  heavily  insulated  walls  allow   the  exterior  side  of  the  building  envelope  to  cool  and  stay  frozen  in  the  winter.  The  exterior   brick  masonry  walls  of  the  Toronto  test  house  walls  do  closely  follow  the  exterior   temperature,  particularly  on  the  north  and  east  elevations.  However,  the  climate  in  Toronto   typically  does  not  steadily  stay  below  the  freezing  point  over  the  winter  months,  so  even  on   elevations  sheltered  from  solar  radiation,  the  temperature  of  the  exterior  brick  masonry   walls  cycle  above  and  below  the  freezing  point.  Where  walls  are  protected  from  solar   radiation,  less  than  20  freeze-thaw  cycles  were  experienced  by  the  brick  masonry.  Where   exposed  to  solar  radiation,  approximately  50  freeze-thaw  cycles  were  experience  by  the   brick  masonry  on  the  south  elevation.  Solar  heat  gains  are  a  major  factor  in  increasing  the   number  of  freeze-thaw  cycles  experience  in  a  winter.

   Furthermore,  in  terms  of  frost  dilatometry,  this  study  examined  if  the  expansion  of  clay   brick  is  greater  along  one  particular  axis,  or  if  brick  expands  uniformly  in  all  directions.  As   can  be  seen  from  the  3-dimensional  frost  dilatometry  expansion  graphs,  the  bricks   analysed  here  do  not  expand  in  a  uniform  manner;  they  expand  in  very  inconsistent   patterns.  Adjacent  specimens  cut  from  the  same  brick  expand  and  crack  in  different   directions;  this  is  likely  caused  by  different  patterns  of  moisture  storage  within  a  single   brick.   Finally,  this  research  explored  if  it  is  possible  to  use  sensors  embedded  in  the  brick  wall  in- situ  to  monitor  if  the  moisture  content  of  brick  units  approach  the  critical  saturation  point   during  winter  months.  Wood  surrogate  moisture  content  sensors  are  very  capable  of   measuring  moisture  within  a  brick,  however  their  speed  and  accuracy  are  in  question.   Issues  experienced  with  precisely  calibrating  the  moisture  content  sensors  were  not  aided   by  the  few  specimens  analysed  to  build  the  RH  calibration  curve.  Moisture  content   measurements  of  brick  at  the  Toronto  test  house  from  the  in-situ  moisture  content  sensors   reveal  that  the  moisture  content  is  half  that  of  the  critical  saturation  point.  This   demonstrates  that  it  is  possible  to  use  wood  surrogate  moisture  content  sensors  in  brick  to   determine  how  closely  the  moisture  content  is  to  the  critical  saturation  point.  However,   determining  the  critical  saturation  point  requires  some  initial  destructive  testing.  The  brick   at  the  Toronto  test  house  should  continue  to  age  well,  even  with  the  recently  installed   polyurethane  foam  insulation  on  the  interior.

   8.  FURTHER  RESEARCH  AND  FUTURE  WORK      WUFI   The  next  step  for  future  work  would  be  to  take  the  clay  brick  critical  saturation  point  data,   the  A-value  data  and  the  porosity  data  and  develop  an  accurate  WUFI  computer  model  for   long-term  projection  of  the  clay  brick  walls  at  the  Toronto  test  house.     Areas  of  improvement   A  problem  that  became  evident  during  the  frost  dilatometry  measurement  process  was   how  delicate  the  wear-pins  were.  The  slightest  bump  while  handling  the  clay  brick   specimens  was  enough  to  move  or  blunt  the  pin  tips,  which  could  cause  error  in  the   measurement.  Also,  the  pins  used  were  of  mild  carbon  steel;  extensive  use  in  the  lab   around  water  would  cause  them  to  rust,  and  their  fine  tips  could  corrode  away  further   adding  error  to  the  measurements.  When  future  work  is  being  performed,  hardened   stainless  wear  pins  should  be  used  as  the  measurement  points  for  the  micrometers.   Although  the  scale  used  in  for  the  majority  of  this  work  had  a  precision  of  0.1  g,  the  use  of  a   highly  precise  scale  with  a  resolution  of  .01  g  would  have  been  beneficial,  and  likely  would   have  helped  eliminate  error  with  regards  to  saturating  the  specimens  to  the  desired   moisture  content.        The  size  of  the  sample  set  was  an  issue  with  this  project,  especially  when  it  came  to   building  the  calibration  curve  for  the  moisture  content  sensors.  A  limited  number  of  clay   bricks  (just  over  a  dozen)  were  extracted  from  the  exterior  wythe  of  the  Toronto  test   144  

   house,  and  distributed  amongst  the  different  research  areas  of  this  paper.  More  brick   specimens  should  be  analysed  during  future  work.  Additional  clay  brick  specimens  could   have  also  been  extracted  from  the  inner  wythe,  to  help  build  much  larger  data  set.   The  moisture  content  sensors  provided  a  slow  response  time,  as  shown  in  the  graphs.  If  a   much  smaller  sensor  could  be  developed,  response  time  may  improve.  Also  improvements   to  the  installation  process  could  provide  improved  measurement  accuracy  and  speed.   Developing  a  technique  to  compress  the  wood  dowel  before  insertion  into  the  brick  could   provide  a  much  better  contact  to  the  pore  structure  of  the  brick  without  the  need  for  brick- dust  as  an  intermediate  capillary  transport  mechanism  between  the  brick  and  the  dowel.   Further  work  studying  the  3-dimensional  freeze-thaw  dilatometry  of  brick  specimens   could  be  investigated.  Due  to  a  limited  number  of  specimens,  the  scope  of  the  3-D  work  in   this  project  was  limited  the  analysis  to  within  the  critical  saturation  region,  however  it   would  be  beneficial  to  determine  if  different  critical  saturation  points  exist  along  different   axes.

   Procedure:   1) Slice  clay  brick  into  10  mm  wide  pieces,  like  a  loaf  of  bread.  Slice  as  many  as   possible;  a  minimum  of  12  pieces  is  required.  Pieces  must  be  full  width  and   cannot  be  broken.   2) Number  each  of  the  specimens.   3) Dry  the  samples  in  a  105Â°C  lab  oven  (Hall  &  Hoff,  2012).  Measure  the  mass  of   the  samples  periodically  during  the  drying  process.  When  the  change  in  mass   is  reduced  to  less  than  0.05%  after  a  2-hour  duration  in  the  oven,  the   specimen  is  considered  to  be  dry.  Record  the  dry  mass  of  each  specimen.   4) Determine  the  saturated  mass  of  each  of  the  samples  as  outlined  in  ASTM- C67-11,  5.1:   a. Submerge  the  specimens  into  clean  room  temperature  water  (15.5  to   30Â°C).  Ensure  water  can  circulate  all  sides  of  the  samples.   b. Heat  the  water  to  a  boil,  and  maintain  the  boil  for  5  hours.   c. Remove  the  heat,  and  allow  the  water  to  cool  to  15.5  to  30Â°C.     d. Remove  each  of  the  cooled  specimens  from  the  bath,  wipe  off  the   excess  water  with  a  damp  cloth,  and  record  each  of  their  saturated   weights.   5)   Determine  the  absorption  coefficient  as  outlined  in  ASTM  C67-11,  10.3:   a. Begin  with  dried  samples  (as  outlined  above).   b. Measure  and  record  the  dimensions  of  the  flat  surface  and  calculate   the  area  of  each  sample.     c. Position  the  container  so  the  bottom  is  flat  and  level.   148  

   d. Place  the  reference  sample  on  top  of  the  supports  in  the  container.   Add  water  until  3.18  mm  Â±  0.25  mm  above  the  supports.   e. Remove  the  reference  sample,  and  place  the  specimens  on  the   supports  with  the  largest  face  in  contact  with  the  water.   f. Time  the  immersion  of  sample:  the  specimen  should  be  in  contact   with  the  water  for  1  minute  (Â±  1  s).   g. Quickly  remove  the  specimen  from  the  supports,  wipe  off  the  excess   water  with  a  damp  cloth,  weigh  and  record  the  mass.   h. Quickly  re-immerse  the  bottom  of  the  specimen  in  the  bath  on  top  of   the  supports  for  another  minute,  and  repeat.   i. Perform  this  measurement  until  the  specimen  is  completely  saturated.   The  "1-minute"  immersion  period  may  need  to  be  adjusted  depending   on  the  porosity  of  the  specimen  (eg.  Adjust  to  5-minute  intervals.)   j. For  each  specimen,  plot  the  change  in  mass  against  the  square  root  of   the  time  of  immersion.   6) Prepare  samples  for  length  measurements:   a. In  the  centre  of  the  end  face  that  terminates  the  length  of  the   specimen,  drill  a  shallow  hole  into  the  sample,  large  enough  to   accommodate  a  mechanical  pin.   b. Insert  the  pin  into  the  hole;  its  length  should  be  shallow  in  the  hole.   The  pin  themselves  should  be  a  stainless  hard  metal  material.   c. Once  fitted,  use  a  two-part  epoxy  to  bond  the  pin  into  the  dry  clay   brick  specimens.  

149  

   d. Allow  the  epoxy  to  harden  as  recommended  by  the  manufacturer.   7) Measure  Dimensions  of  the  specimens:   a. Calibrate  the  micrometer  on  a  gauge  block  before  each  use.   b. Take  a  micrometer  measurement  of  the  outer  dimensions  of  the   rounded  pins  inserted  into  the  samples  in  the  previous  steps.  Tighten   the  ratchet  on  the  micrometer  until  it  clicks.  Mark  this  orientation  on   the  specimen.  Pins  must  be  aligned  with  the  very  centre  of  the  calliper   anvils  to  produce  the  most  consistent  and  accurate  measurement.   c. Rotate  the  sample  180Â°  and  take  a  second  measurement,  and  note  the   orientation  of  the  specimen.     d. Use  the  average  of  the  two  values  at  the  measured  value.   8) Determine  the  first  round  of  !"#$   to  the  nearest  20%  degree:   a. Start  with  five  specimens.   b. Add  water  to  .2,  .4,  .6,  .8  and  1.0  of  the  saturated  moisture  content  for   reach  respective  specimen:     i. For  lower  moisture  contents  simply  add  measured  water  to  the   surface  of  the  sample.   ii. For  greater  moisture  contents,  specimens  may  require  drying  a   saturated  specimen  down  to  the  desired  mass.   c. Wrap  each  of  the  specimens  in  aluminum  foil,  then  in  plastic  wrap,   eliminating  as  much  airspace  as  possible  while  sealing  the  plastic   tightly.    

150  

   d. Let  the  specimens  sit  for  24  hours  to  allow  moisture  to  evenly   distribute.  (If  specimens  have  an  A-value  below  0.005  kg/(m2Â·s1/2)   then  more  time  should  be  allotted  to  allow  the  water  to  distribute   evenly,  up  to  72  hours.   e. Subject  the  specimens  to  6  complete  freeze-thaw  cycles.  (-18Â°C  of  a   conventional  freezer  is  fine.)   f. Unwrap  the  specimens  and  weigh  them  to  confirm  they  have  not  lost   significant  moisture  during  the  freeze/thaw  process.   g. Measure  the  lengths  of  the  specimens  as  in  step  7  above.     h. Calculate  the  amount  of  expansion  experienced  by  each  of  the  samples   using  the  formula:      =
!! ! !! !!

Ã10!   

where:      =  expansion  [micro  strain]   !   =  initial  specimen  length  [mm]   !   =specimen  length  after  six  freeze  thaw  cycles  [mm]      i. The  specimen  that  shows  the  most  dramatic  increase  in  micro  stain  is   considered  to  be  the  one  showing  frost  damage.  Note  the  moisture   content  of  these  samples.  The  second  round  of  analysis  will  more   precisely  focus  on  this  range  of  moisture  content  below  this  range.   151  

   (eg.:  If  the  0.8  moisture  content  specimen  showed  the  most  expansion,   then  the  next  round  will  analyze  specimens  between  0.6  to  0.8  of   saturated  moisture  content.)   j. Samples  that  underwent  freeze/thaw  not  showing  frost  dilation  can   be  reused  in  subsequent  tests;  samples  showing  frost  dilation  damage   should  be  excluded.   9) Determine  the  second  round  of  !"#$   to  the  nearest  5%  degree:   a. If  frost  dilation  occurred  in  the  0.8  moisture  content  sample  then   specimens  having  moisture  contents  of  0.65,  0.7  and  0.75  should  now   be  prepared  and  analyzed  as  outlined  in  Step  8  above.   b. Samples  that  underwent  freeze/thaw  not  frost  showing  dilation  can   be  reused  in  subsequent  tests;  samples  showing  frost  dilation  damage   should  be  excluded.   10)Determine  the  third  round  of  !"#$   to  the  nearest  1%  degree:   a. If  frost  dilation  occurred  in  the  0.8  moisture  content  sample  then   specimens  having  moisture  contents  of  0.75,  0.76,  0.77,  0.78  and  0.79   should  now  be  prepared  and  analyzed  as  outlined  in  Step  8  above,  and   performed  on  as  many  samples  as  possible.   b. Note  the  !"#$   of  these  final  specimens.  The  average  of  the  !"#$   for  the   1%  degree  of  saturation  specimens  should  be  taken  as  the  final  value.

   Procedure:   1) Using  the  20  mm  drill  bit,  carefully  drill  four  adjacent  holes  through  the   drywall  layer  without  drilling  into  the  insulation.  the  holes  should  be  at  least   30  mm  (1-1/4")  away  from  one  another.     2) Hole  #1  will  be  used  for  the  cavity  space  Temp/RH  sensor;  no  further  drilling   will  be  required  for  this  hole.     3) Use  the  ruler  to  determine  the  mid-point  depth  of  the  cavity  space.  This  will   be  the  installation  location  for  Temp/RH  Smart  Sensor  #1.   4) In  hole  #3,  drill  completely  through  the  insulation  layer  and  stop  when  the   drill  bit  hits  clay  brick.  This  will  be  the  installation  depth  of  Temp/RH  Smart   Sensor  #3.   5) Use  the  ruler  to  determine  the  midpoint  of  the  insulation  layer.  The  total   thickness  of  SPF  will  range  between  130  mm  (5")  and  180  mm  (7").  This  SPF- midpoint  depth  will  be  the  drill  depth  for  hole  #2.   6) In  hole  #2,  drill  the  insulation  midpoint  depth  determined  in  step  5,  above.   This  will  be  the  sensor  installation  depth  of  Temp/RH  Smart  Sensor  #2.   7) In  hole  #4,  drill  through  the  insulation  layer  until  the  hits  clay  brick.  Make  a   mark  on  the  drillbit  with  the  permanent  marker:  the  hole  needs  to  be  drilled   105  mm  (4-1/4")  beyond  the  insulation-brick  interface.  This  will  place  the   sensor  just  beyond  the  first  wythe  of  clay  brick  in  the  collar  joint  in  the   centre  of  the  structural  clay  brick  wall.   8) Commission  the  Onset  HOBO  Microstation  for  each  location  using  the   HOBOware  software:   158  

   a. Connect  four  sensors  to  each  Microstation.   b. Assign  each  sensor  a  unique  identifiable  name/number.   c. Physically  label  each  sensor  with  its  corresponding  name.   d. Set  the  measurement  duration  to  a  reasonable  time.  (15-minute   increments.)   e. Launch  the  Microstation   f. Install  the  cover  on  the  Microstation  enclosure.   9) Insert  each  sensor  to  the  desired  depth  within  the  wall:  centre  of  cavity,   centre  of  insulation,  insulation-brick  interface  and  centre  of  clay  brick  wall.   10)Carefully  seal  each  sensor  in  place  with  Great  Stuff  polyurethane  foam.  Care   must  be  taken  to  prevent  the  SPF  from  reaching  the  front  face  of  the   Temp/RH  sensors.  (Otherwise,  the  sensor  would  inaccurately  measure   relative  humidity.)     11)Use  the  HOBOware  software  to  commission  and  launch  the  portable  Onset   U10  Temp/RH  data  loggers.   12)Install  a  portable  Onset  U10  Temp/RH  data  logger  on  the  exterior  side  of  the   wall  at  each  of  the  sensor  cluster  locations.  In  areas  that  are  in  direct   exposure  to  rain,  the  U10s  should  be  loosely  covered  with  a  tent  of  Tyvek  or   SBPO  membrane.   13)Use  the  Onset  USB  Shuttle  to  offload  the  data  from  each  of  the  data  loggers  on   a  regular  basis.

   1) Determine  which  clay  bricks  to  remove  from  the  wall.  Avoid  removing  clay   bricks  from  damaged  areas  and  from  locations  with  high  structural  load.   (Near  windows,  corners,  etc.)   2) Use  the  point-tuck  blade  on  the  angle  grinder  to  quickly  remove  as  much  of   the  mortar  joint  as  possible.  This  is  a  very  dusty  process.  Use  a  dust  mask  or   respirator,  safety  glasses,  and  other  appropriate  safety  gear.     3) The  point  tuck  blade  will  only  remove  a  depth  of  approximately  40  mm  (1- 1/2")  from  the  mortar.  A  hammer  drill  will  be  used  for  the  remaining  depth.   4) Choose  an  appropriate  diameter  bit  for  the  mortar  joint.  Some  of  the  joints   are  very  tight  and  require  a  smaller  bit.   5) Begin  chiselling  away  at  the  mortar  joint  with  the  hammer  drill.  Start  at  one   end  of  the  mortar  joint  and  drill  squarely  into  it.  Drill  to  a  depth  of  about  115   mm  (4-1/2").     6) Next  drill  a  hole  directly  beside  the  first  hole,  slightly  overlapping.  Continue   until  the  entire  mortar  joint  has  been  removed  from  around  all  sides  of  the   clay  brick.   7) The  clay  brick  should  fall  on  its  own  once  enough  mortar  has  been  removed.   If  it  does  not,  use  the  pry  bar  and  tap  lightly  with  the  hammer.  Gently  pry  the   clay  brick  until  the  collar  joint  separates  at  the  back.   8) Label  each  clay  brick:  wall  and  location.           

161  

   Reinstallation  Procedure:   1) Determine  that  the  replacement  clay  bricks  are  an  appropriate  size  for  the   opening.   2) Clean  and  vacuum  out  the  openings  in  the  wall  in  preparation  for  the  new   mortar.  The  openings  should  be  free  of  debris,  dust  and  should  be  dry.   3) Mix  the  mortar:   a. Mix  one  part  mortar  to  three  parts  clean  sand  in  the  bucket.   b. Add  water  in  small  amounts  and  mix  the  mortar  until  wet  and  well   stirred.  The  mix  should  not  be  watery  or  soupy.   4) All  clay  brick  surfaces  should  be  dry  prior  to  applying  the  mortar.  Use  the   trowel  to  place  a  layer  of  mortar  in  the  opening.   5) Use  the  trowel  to  put  a  layer  of  mortar  on  the  side  of  the  opening.   6) Use  the  trowel  to  "butter"  mortar  onto  the  sides  of  the  replacement  clay   brick.   7) Put  the  new  clay  brick  in  place,  and  tap  it  into  position.  The  brick  masonry   unit  should  be  plumb  and  line  up  with  the  other  clay  bricks  when  in  final   position.   8) Repeat  until  the  opening  is  closed  up.   9) To  point  the  last  (top)  mortar  joint,  make  a  5  mm  thick  layer  of  mortar  on  the   Hawk  and  slide  it  into  the  gap  with  the  trowel.  Make  sure  mortar  is  pushed   all  the  way  to  the  back  of  the  joint.  Pack  the  joints  full  of  mortar.   10)Use  the  Jointing  Tool  in  a  sliding  back-and-forth  motion  to  press  the  mortar   into  place,  and  to  create  a  concavity  in  the  face  of  the  mortar  joint.   162  

   11)Clean  all  tools  before  the  mortar  sets  and  bonds  to  them.  

PROCEDURE  #5:  INSTALLATION  OF  MOISTURE  CONTENT  SENSORS  IN   CLAY  BRICK      The  wood  surrogate  sensors  must  be  installed  directly  into  the  clay  brick  in  order  to   measure  their  moisture  content.  Clay  bricks  should  be  extracted,  the  sensors   installed,  and  then  the  clay  bricks  should  be  placed  back  into  their  original  positions   in  the  exterior  walls.  Refer  to  Procedure  #4:  Clay  brick  Extraction  and   Reinstallation.      Sensors  will  be  installed  from  the  exterior  side  of  the  envelope,  and  cables  routed  to   a  central  location  where  the  data  loggers  are  mounted  on  the  interior.  All  cables   neatly  routed  along  the  exterior  of  the  building  will  be  less  intrusive  than  installing   the  sensors  from  the  interior.

   Procedure:   1) Locate  the  areas  on  the  exterior  wall  that  are  in  close  proximity  to  the  Temp/RH   sensors  already  installed.  (See  Procedure  3:  Temp  RH  Sensor  Installation.)     2) Carefully  remove  an  exterior  clay  brick.  (See  Procedure  4:  Clay  brick  Extraction  &   Replacement.)   3) Label  the  backside  of  the  clay  brick  with  its  location  information.   4) Use  a  drill  press  to  drill  a  hole  close  to  the  outside  face  of  the  clay  brick:   a. Lay  down  a  sheet  of  paper  to  capture  the  dust  from  the  drilling  process.  This   clay  brick  dust  will  be  reused  later.   b. Secure  the  clay  brick  to  the  drilling  platform  so  it  does  not  wobble.  Any   movement  of  the  old  brittle  clay  brick  while  drilling  close  to  the  face  could   cause  the  face  to  pop  off.   c. Position  the  centre  point  of  the  hole  13  mm  from  the  face  of  the  clay  brick.   Start  with  a  small  bit  and  create  a  pilot  hole.  Increase  the  size  of  the  bit  and   slowly  widen  the  hole.  The  final  size  should  be  a  12.7  mm  (1/2")  diameter  by   50  mm  (2")  deep  hole.  Drilling  a  hole  with  a  large  bit  very  close  to  the  face   without  a  pilot  hole  could  cause  the  face  to  pop  off.     d. Collect  and  save  the  clay  brick  dust  for  each  clay  brick.   5) Use  a  hammer  drill  to  make  a  hole  in  the  exposed  face  of  the  inside  wythe  clay  brick.   This  can  easily  be  done  through  the  opening  from  the  removed  clay  brick.  If  drilling   toward  the  middle  of  the  clay  brick,  pilot  holes  are  not  necessary.   6) Place  0.5  cc  of  clay  brick  dust  from  the  drilling  procedure  back  into  the  hole  of  the   respective  clay  brick.

PROCEDURE  #7:  DETERMINING  THE  WATER  ABSORPTION   COEFFICIENT  (A-VALUE)  FOR  CLAY  BRICK  WATER  UPTAKE.   
  

The  speed  at  which  a  clay  brick  absorbs  water  is  one  of  the  characteristics  used  by   software  such  as  WUFI  when  analysing  the  wetting  and  dry  capabilities  of  a  wall   envelope.    
     

Equipment  list:   Â· Clay  brick  specimens,  (full  clay   brick  units),     Â· Extra  Clay  brick  for  set  up  of  the   basin   Â· Large  shallow  basin  (such  as  a   storage  tote,  approximately  1  m  x   .5  m  x  .15  m)     Â· Dowels  or  rods  to  support  clay   bricks   Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Stop  watch   Scale,  .5  g  resolution   Distilled  water   Damp  cloth,  wrung  dry   Drying  Oven  

169  

   Procedure:  

1) Place  Clay  brick  specimens  in  the  drying  oven  at  105Â°C  until  they  no  longer  decrease   in  weight  from  water  drying.  (Approximately  2  days,  if  they  are  wet.)     2) Place  the  plastic  tote  basin  on  a  workbench,  or  in  an  area  at  a  convenient  height  for   working.   3) Place  the  2  support  rods  parallel  to  one  another  in  the  bottom  of  the  basin.   4) The  clay  brick  will  be  stood  on  end  on  top  of  the  support  rods.  Precisely  measure  the   area  of  each  clay  brick  end  (i.e.  the  face  of  the  clay  brick  that  is  approximately  65   mm  x  100  mm).     5) Record  the  dry  weight  of  each  specimen.   6) To  set  up  the  water  level,  place  the  extra  clay  brick  on  top  of  the  rods,  so  that  it  is   standing  on  end.  The  clay  brick  should  be  plumb  once  in  place.   7) Carefully  add  distilled  water  to  the  basin  until  the  water  reaches  the  bottom  of  the   clay  brick.  Water  should  cover  the  support  rods  by  3  mm  Â±.25  mm.     8) Remove  the  set  up  clay  brick  from  the  support  rods.   9) Take  an  initial  weight  of  the  first  specimen.   10)Stand  the  specimen  on  the  support  rods,  just  as  the  set  up  clay  brick  had  been   positioned.   11)Immediately  start  the  timer.   12)At  the  1-minute  mark,  quickly  but  carefully  remove  the  clay  brick  from  the  basin,   immediately  wipe  the  bottom  with  the  damp  cloth,  weigh  the  specimen,  then  replace   in  upon  the  support  rods.   13)Repeat  this  every  minute  until  the  entire  clay  brick  has  visibly  absorbed  water.    

170  

   14)Note:  clay  bricks  with  a  slow  absorption  rate  may  not  require  1-minute   measurement  intervals.  Measurements  for  such  clay  bricks  could  be  taken  at  5- minute  intervals.     15)The  absorption  coefficient  is  stated  by  the  formula:  
  
E QUATION   2:    W ATER   A BSORPTION   C OEFFICIENT   

   =

     Ã   

    

  where,      A-Value  =  the  Water  Absorption  Coefficient,  as  used  by  WUFI  [kg/m2s1/2]     wt  =  Mass  of  water,  [kg]         a  =  area  of  clay  brick  face  in  the  water,  [m2]   t  =  time  [s]
