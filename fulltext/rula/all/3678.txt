ABSTRACT

Hybrid PD Sliding Mode Control for Robotic Manipulators

John Michael Acob, Master of Applied Science Aerospace Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto 2015

This thesis proposes a new control law for the purpose of providing improved tracking and contouring performance of robotic manipulators. The rationale behind the development of this controller involves the hybridization of existing proportional-derivative (PD) and sliding mode control (SMC) laws. The new control law retains similar ease of implementation as traditional PD/PID controllers with the added benefit of a nonlinear switching component inherent from sliding mode control systems. In addition, it eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the system dynamics that are required in standard SMC laws. The stability analysis of the proposed control law is conducted through the Lyapunov method. Simulations using linear and nonlinear contours, and under varying dynamic conditions are performed in order to compare its performances to existing control schemes. The proposed hybrid PD-SMC control law is proven to provide good, robust tracking and contouring performance.

INTRODUCTION

BACKGROUND
Development of early industrial robots occurred in the 1960s as a result of the

convergence of two technologies: numerical control (NC) machines for precise manufacturing, and tele-operated machines for the remote handling of hazardous material. Compared to its predecessors, the first robot manipulators were characterized by their versatility, adaptability, positioning accuracy, and execution repeatability (Siciliano, Sciavicco, Villani, & Oriolo, 2009). In the following decades, industrial robots gained widespread popularity as essential components for the realization of automated manufacturing systems. The increasingly wide range of applications in the manufacturing industry to where robotics technology is being applied is the result of several factors, including the reduction of manufacturing costs, the increase in productivity, improvement of production quality, and the reduction or the elimination of harmful tasks for the human operator. In recent years, following an interruption caused by the global financial crisis in 2009, the trend towards automation continued. In fact, 2011 was the most successful year for industrial robots since 1961 (International Federation of Robotics, 2013). In that year, industrial robot sales increased by 38% to 166,028 units. This was by far the highest level ever recorded for a single year. According to the IFR Executive Summary, the predominant user of industrial robots is the automotive/motor vehicle industry.

In light of the continued trend towards automation over a wide range of applications, industrial robots display significant characteristics of versatility and accuracy. By virtue of their programmability, industrial robots remain essential components to many automated systems, see Figure 1.2. Industrial robots are a subset of the broader category of robotic systems. A robotic system is composed of several subsystems, including a mechanical subsystem of rigid or deformable bodies, a sensing subsystem, an actuation subsystem, a controller, and an information-processing subsystem, see Figure 1.3. These subsystems communicate among themselves via interfaces, whose function is decoding and transmitting data between mediums. Robots with a fixed base are classified as robot manipulators (Siciliano, Sciavicco, Villani, & Oriolo, 2009).

Figure 1.3: General Architecture of a Robotic Mechanical System (Angeles, 2007).

The manipulator's sequence of rigid bodies (links) is interconnected by means of articulation (joints). The fundamental structure of a manipulator is a serial, or open kinematic

chain. Alternatively, a manipulator can contain closed kinematic chains when a sequence of links forms a loop. Robotic manipulators can have several different geometries with varying levels of dexterity and stiffness. Serial manipulators have good dexterity and have straightforward dynamics while closed chain manipulators, of particular interest those with parallel geometries, have the fundamental advantage of high structural stiffness with respect to serial manipulators at the cost of reduced workspaces. The industrial application of the robotic manipulator is a factor that determines its geometry. In all robot applications, the completion of a generic task requires the execution of a specified prescribed motion. This execution is entrusted to the control system. Due to the significance of programmable robots in industry, the research and development of effective control laws is important. Each control law is designed to compensate for the inherent imprecisions, disturbances, and other errors presented in the system. The causes for these imprecisions include unmodeled friction and vibrational dynamics, hardware deficiencies, process-generated disturbances, and other inaccuracies of the system dynamics (Slotine & Li, 1988). For many industrial applications, good trajectory tracking control is very important. Depending on the specific application or environment, the uncertainty or parameter fluctuation may call for increased robustness of the controller. It is important to take each of these factors as well as the previously mentioned imprecisions into account when designing or implementing a control law. The scope of this thesis involves the proposal of a hybrid controller that employs PD control as well as the nonlinear switching component of sliding mode control. It will demonstrate

4

that this proposed PD-SMC law is a powerful and robust control law for improving the trajectory and contour tracking performance of robot manipulators. This is a crucial area of research since the increasing trend in automation calls for control laws that provide more accurate and robust performance.

MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES
The motivation behind this research is to improve the tracking performance of robotic

manipulators and, through the reduction of tracking error, seek to improve contour tracking performance as well. This thesis will propose a new hybrid control law based on PD and sliding mode control theory to provide a powerful and robust control law. By providing accurate control on the joint level, the overall tracking performance of the manipulator will be improved. The overall goals of the proposed hybrid PD-SMC law are: 1. To provide an alternative to standard PID/PD control laws. 2. To incorporate the advantages of nonlinear control into an easily implemented control law. 3. To improve performance by reducing joint tracking errors in comparison to traditional PD control. 4. To provide robust tracking performance for systems with imprecisely modeled dynamics or fluctuations in parameters. 5. To provide a model-free alternative to sliding mode control laws that require knowledge of the dynamics of the system. In this thesis, the proposed hybrid PD-SMC law will be verified through simulations for linear and nonlinear contours. To demonstrate the performance and improvements, standard PD 5

and SMC laws will also be simulated and the tracking and contour errors will be compared for various motions and loading cases. To fulfill these goals, the following objectives will be achieved: 1. Model the dynamics of a simplified RRR serial planar manipulator and a five-bar planar parallel manipulator. 2. Formulate a hybrid PD sliding mode control law. 3. Verify the stability of the proposed controller using the Lyapunov method. 4. Perform a comparison of the proposed hybrid PD-SMC law and the conventional PD and SMC laws at the joint and end-effector level. 5. Extend the comparison to high-speed and payload cases in order to verify the robustness of the proposed controller.

LITERATURE REVIEW

If the dynamic model of a controlled system is known perfectly, an idealized controller may be implemented in order to achieve very good system performance. Practically, however, system parameters may be difficult to determine and are never known perfectly. In addition, the external payloads and disturbances introduced to the system can make it very difficult to implement an ideal controller. One of the reasons why adaptive and robust controllers are developed is to overcome these dynamic model uncertainties and external disturbances (Sage, De Mathelin, & Ostertag, 1999). On the other hand, there exists some control methods that do not require previous knowledge of system dynamics, which makes them easily implemented. However, they often do not account for nonlinearities in the dynamics of the system. In applications that require more precise tracking performance, these control laws may not be sufficient. Therefore, different types of control systems were developed for different applications. In this chapter, some popular and commonly applied control systems are reviewed.

2.1

PD/PID CONTROL
Because of its simple structure, the clear physical meaning of each control gain, and easy

implementation, PID control (as well as PI and PD control) has garnered widespread popularity amongst engineers, with more than 90% of all control loops using some form of PID (ÃstrÃ¶m & HÃ¤gglund, 2001). PD/PID has been very widely employed in many industrial applications, such as robotic control, process control, and automatic systems.

2.1.1

General PID Control

A typical PID controller has the following form:


where  ,  , and  are the proportional, integral, and derivative gain matrices of the control system, respectively, and () is the torque. The tracking error, which can be a vector, is defined as: () =  -  (2.2)

() =  () +   () +   ()
0

(2.1)

Although the basic structure of the PID controller is quite simple, as shown in Figure 2.1 , it has been shown that with appropriately selected control gains, a simple linear and decoupled PD controller may have acceptable tracking performances for many applications (Qu, 1994).

Figure 2.1: Block Diagram of Ideal PID Control

PID control has been applied for the tracking control of robotic manipulators (Hsu, Chiu, & Tsai, 2011; Pervozvanski & Freidovich, 1999) and although PID is effective when

9

implemented as a position controller, care must be taken into the tuning of the control gains through the use of a theoretical backing. A theorem proposed by Kawamura et al. proves that a robot equipped with a linear PD feedback loop at each joint can track a desired trajectory described by time functions if the velocity feedback gain is set sufficiently large (Kawamura, Miyazaki, & Arimoto, 1988). There have been several other research endeavors for PD control on its global stability for trajectory tracking with robotic manipulators (Qu, 1994; Chen, Chen, Wang, & Woo, 2000). The high control gains of PD control, however, may cause vibration problems due to overreaction and amplification of the measurement noise. Also, there are still certain cases for which standard PID control is inappropriate due to its inability to adjust to system dynamics. 2.1.2 PD with Desired Gravity Compensation

Although the use of PID control is extensive for the control of robotic manipulators, the choice of PID gains relies on relatively complex formulae in order to ensure global asymptotic stability (Arimoto & Miyazaki, 1984; Qu & Dorsey, 1991). The landmark work of Takegaki and Arimoto (1981) provided a robust position control that is easily tuned for global asymptotic stability. The PD control law with desired gravity compensation for setpoint control proposed by Takegaki and Arimoto (1981)can be written as:  =   -   + ( ) (2.3)

where  represents the torque in this formula and ( ) is the vector of gravitational torques of the system at the desired joint angles. Graphically, this control law is represented in Figure 2.2 and  =  . 10

Figure 2.2: PD control with desired gravity compensation (Kelly, 1997).

The PD with desired gravity compensation control law is able to drive the manipulator in such a way that the robot joints are asymptotically placed at their desired values. It does this independently of the initial position and velocity. Although this controller has a simple structure, it still requires knowledge of the system dynamics in order to calculate the gravitational torque vector terms. This desired gravity component can be seen as a feedforward term that helps the control law compensate for the system dynamics. 2.1.3 Nonlinear PD/PID Control

One of the weaknesses of standard PD/PID control is that it may suffer in performance due to the linearity of the control law and its poor compensation for the inherent nonlinearity of many practical dynamic systems (and sensors). One method of refining the PID control law was proposed by Rugh (1987), where he designed a law by the extended linearization technique in which the assumed nonlinear plant and sensor, as shown in Figure 2.3, are linearized about every closed-loop set point with the appropriate PID controller. In his proposed design, the gains of the controller in the form of PID are appropriately defined functions of the error state. 11

Figure 2.3: Nonlinear Closed-Loop System (Rugh, 1987).

This Nonlinear PD (NPD) control is, in general, a control where the gains are functions of tracking errors. Consider the general system equation:  +  ( , ) =  (2.4)

where  and  are system states and  ( , ) is a nonlinear, state-dependent term. According to Xu et al., for force control of a setpoint task, we have the NPD control in the form:  =  +  +  +  ( , ) (2.5)

where  and  are gains,  is the desired force,  =  -  , and  ( , ) is the estimate of from the desired setpoint as follows (Xu, Hollerbach, & Ma, 1995): Â· Â·

( , ). The NPD's control action depends on whether the system is moving towards or away Moving away from setpoint: increase gains to stop the system Moving toward setpoint: decrease gains to minimize the residual energy at the goal This can be illustrated graphically in Figure 2.4. Although the study presented by Xu et

al., was for force control, their methods are equally applicable to position control. Several other previous studies were conducted involving NPD control, however many were applied only to 12

point-set control of linear systems (Armstrong & Wade, 2000; Seraji, 1998). Ouyang (2005) extended NPD to a form of adaptive NPD learning control designed for repetitive tasks of robotic mechanisms.

Figure 2.4: Illusatration of NPD Control (Xu, Hollerbach, & Ma, 1995).

The NPD control laws provide a method of compensation for the nonlinear system dynamics of many mechanical systems, but may demand some involved stability requirements. Also, as with other forms of control with feedforward terms, knowledge of the system dynamics is required for this approach.

2.2

OTHER CONTROL METHODS
The previous section introduced some of fundamental control concepts used for robotic

manipulators over the course of study in industry. This section furthers the discussion to some more advanced methods of control, including event-driven control (EDC), adaptive control, and learning control.

13

2.2.1

Event-Driven Control

The majority of research in control theory and engineering considers time-triggered or periodic control systems where signals are acquired at a fixed sample rate in an attempt to represent a continuous time signal (Heemels, Sandee, & Van Den Bosch, 2008). There are cases, however, where it is of interest to consider event-driven control systems where instead of timetriggered sampling, samples are acquired at the occurrence of an event. The traditional timetriggered control methods have the controller performing a new control action at the prescribed time interval even when there is nothing happening in the system. This can lead to the unnecessary utilization of system resources (ÃrzÃ©n, 1999). ÃrzÃ©n (1999) proposed a simple event-based PID controller that consists of two parts: (1) an event detection part that uses time-triggered sampling on a sampling interval that is the same as the sampling interval of the corresponding time-triggered PID controller, and (2) an eventtriggered PID controller that uses the output of the event detection part. This output sends a request to the PID control algorithm that a new control signal should be calculated. This is represented graphically in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.5: Event-Driven PID Structure (ÃrzÃ©n, 1999).

14

Typically, an embedded controller on a real-time operating system uses available central processing unit (CPU) time that is shared between independently running tasks. Using CPU resources when there is nothing of significance happening in the process is clearly a waste of resources. Experiments conducted by ÃrzÃ©n with this control structure indicate significant reduction in CPU utilization with only a minor control performance penalty. In work conducted by Wang et al. (2011), event-driven controllers are shown to have practical application to motion control, including vehicle longitudinal control and quadrotor control. In their study, the use of event-triggered controllers yielded strong robustness with the need for only few computing resources. Additionally, small system vibrations in the quadrotor were eliminated while the number of actuation steps was diminished.

2.2.2

Adaptive Control

From looking at the previous section, we can generally see that for a given form of controller (i.e. PID), there is a trend for better performance with a more intimate knowledge of the plant dynamics. In fact, there are many current techniques that rely on having a good understanding of the plant under study in some form or another (Sastry & Bodson, 1989). However, there are a number of instances where either the system to be controlled is far too complex, or the basic physical processes of the system are not fully understood. Adaptive control compensates for this by obtaining a progressively better understanding of the plant dynamics to be controlled. Thus, adaptive control can be viewed as being composed of two parts (Craig, 1988):

15

1. an identification portion that identifies the parameters that appear in the controller of the plant, or the parameters of the plant itself and; 2. a control law portion, which implements the control law that is in some way a function of the identified parameters. If the identification of the plant is periodically updated on the basis of previous estimates and new data, then the system identification is said to be recursive and the identification and control may be performed concurrently to one another. From the above discussion, it can be said that adaptive control is designed to compensate for the time-varying parameters of the controlled system. It should also be noted that system identification can also be targeted at the determination of whether the plant is linear or nonlinear, finite or infinite dimensional, and has continuous or discrete event dynamics (Sastry & Bodson, 1989). If these have already been determined, then the adaptive control law will be limited to the parametric system identification or parametric adaptive control, as was discussed. In common frameworks there are three schemes for parametric adaptive control: (1) gain scheduling, (2) model reference adaptive control (MRAC), and (3) self-tuning regulators (STC) (ÃstrÃ¶m K. J., 1983). Gain scheduling was one of the earliest and most intuitive approaches to adaptive control. With gain scheduling, auxiliary process variables, other than those from the plant used as feedback, were found that correlate well with process dynamics. The advantage of this type of control is that the parameters can be changed as quickly as the auxiliary measurement. Although gain scheduling was popular in practice, it does have the drawback of being an open-loop adaptation scheme with no real intelligence. Also, the extent of design that is required may be enormous, depending on the system. Gain scheduling is represented graphically in Figure 2.6. 16

Figure 2.6: Gain Scheduling Controller (Sastry & Bodson, 1989).

There are two types of MRAC laws: series high gain scheme and parallel scheme, both represented schematically in Figure 2.7. For each of these schemes, the desired performance of the closed-loop system is specified through a reference model and the adaptive system attempts to make the plant output match the reference model. With the parallel scheme, however, the inner or regulator loop acts as an ordinary control loop consisting of the plant and regulator, and the outer adaptation loop adjusts the parameters of the regulator in such a way to drive the error between the model and plant output to zero.

Figure 2.7: MRAC Laws (a) Series High-Gain Scheme (b) Parallel Scheme (Sastry & Bodson, 1989).

Self-tuning regulators, as shown in Figure 2.8, have an identifier or estimator that produces a set of estimated parameters based on past plant inputs and outputs. The controller then uses these to produce the current control input for the plant.

17

Figure 2.8: Self-Tuning Controller (Sastry & Bodson, 1989).

With regard to improving trajectory tracking performances of robotic manipulators, there has been significant research on the basis of adaptive control, including the control for directdrive SCARA robots (Dessaint, Saad, HÃ©bert, & Al-Haddad, 1992). Furthermore, Tomei (1991) and Kuc & Han (2000) have employed adaptive control laws to PD and PID loops, respectively. This implementation of adaptive control laws with existing laws owes to the flexibility of adaptive controls. Slotine (1991) gives further details of the advantages and drawbacks of adaptive controls. 2.2.3 Learning Control

Learning control is similar to adaptive control where it uses gathered information from the past processes in order to determine its control performance for the future. The difference is that adaptive control depends on very recent history and reacts only to the current state, while a learning controller depends on long term history and remembers previous states with their appropriate responses (White & Sofge, 1992). Learning control operates in the context of an objective function and receives performance feedback. This feedback is used to determine how appropriate the current behaviour is in the context of the objective function. It is not necessary to have a parametric model for the system with learning control. In addition, the uncertainty can be compensated since the system 18

"learns" as it is propagated through trials. Both adaptive control and learning control are used to simplify the process of implementing the controller and to improve system performance by improving reliability of the system.

2.3

HYBRIDIZATION OF CONTROL LAWS
The previous section established some details for a few methods of advanced control. For

several of them, it involved PID or other types of controllers in its implementation. This can be seen as the hybridization of several control laws in order to achieve a more desirable performance than that of which the individual control law is capable. This section will review in more detail the concept of control hybridization on iterative learning control (ILC), which can be used as a hybrid control system. Some specific hybrid control systems are reviewed including switching control, and the sliding mode control associated with the thesis. 2.3.1 Iterative Learning Control

Iterative learning control is based on the idea that the performance of a system can be improved by learning previous executions of the same task over and over again. Through these repeated actions, the properties of unknown dynamics may be revealed during the completion of a task. Although ILC emulates human learning, ILC differs from other learning-type control algorithms, such as adaptive control. Adaptive control modifies the controller, a system, where ILC modifies the control input, a signal (Bristow, Tharayil, & Alleyne, 2006). Arimoto et al. (1984) defined ILC as class of control algorithms to achieve asymptotic zero tracking error by an iterative process. Therefore, the objective of ILC is to incorporate error information into the control for subsequent iterations, thereby improving performance. In doing so, low transient tracking error and high performance are achieved in spite of model uncertainties 19

and disturbances. A typical ILC in the time domain is under a simple closed-loop or open-loop. These two types of ILC can be classified as either off-line or on-line, respectively, represented schematically in Figure 2.9. ILC can be further classified into P-Type, D-Type, and PID Type (Ouyang, 2005). Several research papers have proposed controllers of these types including an adaptive PID learning control for the control of robotic manipulators where the control gains are functions of not only previous iterations, but are also complex functions of the errors of the current iteration (Kuc & Han, 2000). This is an example of creating a hybrid control algorithm by taking explicitly the characteristics of several different algorithms.

Figure 2.9: Two types of Iterative Learning Control (a) Off-line ; (b) On-line (Ouyang, 2005).

20

Ouyang (2005) proposed a hybrid PD-type online learning control (PD-OLC) for the tracking of a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. This control was demonstrated to be robust with respect to uncertainties and disturbances on the controlled system. He also formulated a hybrid adaptive nonlinear PD learning control (NPD-LC) which incorporated both feedback plus feedforward control, while classical ILC is only feedforward control. Because adaptive NPD-LC is an on-line learning control it is expected to have faster convergent speed than classical ILC. 2.3.2 Switching Control

Switching control systems are those that have discrete event dynamics as well as continuous time dynamics. It should be noted that in the field of controls research, switching control systems are also called hybrid control systems. The distinction should be made that the thesis uses the term hybrid control systems to denote control systems in general that include two or more contributing control laws. Switching control systems are characterized by the interaction of continuous parts, governed by differential equations, and discrete parts that are described by finite states machines, if-then-else rules, and propositional and temporal logic (Ouyang, 2005). The interface between the components is shown in Figure 2.10, where DES stands for discrete event system,  is the input,  is the output and  means the "hybrid" part of the system. The index i is analogous to a time index for the discrete system in that it specifies the order of states or events in the system (Stiver & Antsaklis, 1992).

21

Figure 2.10: Interactions in a switching control system (Stiver & Antsaklis, 1992).

These types of controllers produce switches between a countable, possibly finite, number of fixed controllers until stability is detected. As such, they are theoretically attractive for providing performance with asymptotic stability for a wide array of various plants. They do, however, require a long time to search for stabilizing feedback and as such, provide poor transient properties (Antsaklis & Nerode, 1998). 2.3.3 Sliding Mode Control

Sliding mode control has been studied to extent in order to handle the problems of nonlinear dynamic control systems with modeling uncertainties, time-varying parameter fluctuations, and external disturbances (Slotine & Li, 1991). For this control law, a sliding mode surface is defined for an  -order dynamic system as:

Slotine & Li (1991), it can be seen that an  -order tracking problem can be replaced by a first-

where  is strictly a positive constant. With this definition, following the process outlined by

-1   =  +  

(2.6)

order stabilization problem of keeping  at zero. By choosing an appropriate control law, the

system trajectories can be constrained to point to the time-varying surface (). In other words, it 22

makes the surface an invariant set. Once on the surface the system is said to be in sliding mode. If the dynamics of the system are exactly known, then by solving the dynamics while in sliding mode ( = 0), an expression for the control force , called the equivalent control  , can be

obtained and is interpreted as the continuous control law that would maintain perfect tracking  = 0.

Figure 2.11: Chattering about the sliding surface (Slotine & Li, Applied Nonlinear Control, 1991).

Because of inherent uncertainty in the system model, only the best estimate for equivalent control is obtained, denoted   . Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of SMC is the

discontinuous nature that arises from this. In order to satisfy the sliding condition, a term that is discontinuous across the surface  = 0 is added to obtain the control law: where  is a control parameter and () is the sign function. It can be interpreted that since the  =   - () (2.7)

control system deliberately switches between distinctively different structures based on the state of the system and some predefined rules, that SMC is a kind of switching or hybrid control (Ouyang, 2005).

23

Ideally, the switching of the controller happens instantaneously, resulting in a system trajectory that stays in sliding mode, as desired. However, in reality the finite sampling rate will cause the trajectory to oscillate about the sliding surface, as shown in Figure 2.11. This so-called chatter is in general undesirable since it can excite high-frequency dynamics of the system for which the control is unaccounted. The introduction of a boundary layer can smooth the trajectory (Slotine & Li, 1991). In addition to general SMC, there has been research on advanced control strategies involving SMC including using genetic algorithms to optimize control gains (Li et al., 1996) and fuzzy chatter-free control (Allamehzadeh & Cheung, 2002).

2.4

TRACKING AND CONTOUR ERROR
Tracking and Contour Error

2.4.1

The performance of industrial manipulators is often related to two parameters: tracking error and contour error. Tracking error is the result of the individual axial tracking performance of each actuator. Another way to describe this is how well the controller for each axis can track the desired reference position or other state variable. Mathematically, the tracking error can be expressed as  =  -  (2.8)

where  is the reference, or desired, position, and  is the actual position.

24

Figure 2.12: Tracking and Contour Error (Yeh & Hsu, 2003).

Contour error, however, can be defined as the component of error that is orthogonal to the desired path or contour. In conventional multi-axis contouring systems, contour errors arise from the differences in loop parameters, disturbance loads, and the complexity of the contour shape. Additional error sources due to mechanical hardware can include backlash and friction (Koren & Lo, 1991). 2.4.2 Contour Error Calculation

Figure 2.13: Error model for a linear contour (Koren & Lo, 1991).

For many simple contour shapes, such as lines and circles, contour error is easy to determine. For linear contours, the contour error  is given by: 25

where  and  are the tracking error at the actual position , and  is the angle formed by the tracking error.

(2.9)

contour and the x-axis at the desired position  . Note that Figure 2.13 uses capitals to denote For circular contours, the Cartesian equation of a circle can be used to find the contour

error as follows
2

where  is the radius of the circle, (0 , 0 ) is the corresponding center of the circle and (  ,   ) are the actual coordinates. For general free-form contours the determination of contour error requires a more involved method. Cheng & Lee (2005) give a detailed algorithm for obtaining free-form contour errors. A simple method of approximating freeÂ­form contours is done by locally approximating the contour as a circle and if the axial errors are much smaller than the instantaneous radius of curvature, a contour error can be found by Eq. (2.10). It should be noted also that improving tracking performance does not necessarily guarantee good contouring performance (Koren & Lo, 1991).

REMARKS
This chapter presented various control algorithms that are designed with the intent of

improving system performance. It was shown that virtually all of the presented control systems could be applied to the tracking control of robotic manipulators. The purpose of this chapter was to provide some insights into different control design methodologies and to outline key advantages and drawbacks of each. It was shown that if improved tracking performance is 26

desired then in general it requires some a priori knowledge of system dynamics. However, control laws that feedforward system dynamics behaviour can become difficult to implement. Thus, some advanced control methods such as ILC offer ways to reduce the amount of required knowledge of the system while also improving performance. However, there may still exist issues regarding stability or ease of implementation. Progressing further, the notion of hybrid control systems was introduced. It was shown that combining two or more control laws by their desirable traits can significantly improve system dynamic response. To further the notion of hybrid control systems, the next chapter will contain formulation for a hybrid PD sliding mode control law. The main motivation for this research is to improve tracking and contouring performance over standard PD/PID control schemes while maintaining a similar level of ease of implementation by hybridizing with sliding mode control's discontinuous property to account for system nonlinearities.

Chapter 3 :

HYBRID PD SLIDING MODE CONTROL

In this chapter the dynamics of a general robotic manipulator is presented. The formulation for PD control of the manipulator is presented and a general SMC law with included dynamic model uncertainties is formulated. A hybridization of PD and SMC is discussed along with the rationale and methodology behind it. Finally, the stability analysis of the proposed control law is conducted for the control of robotic manipulators with the Lyapunov method.

3.1

DYNAMIC MODEL
The dynamic equations of motion of a robotic manipulator embody the relationship

between the torques/forces applied by the actuators and the resulting motion of the manipulator (Craig, 2005). The dynamics can be mathematically represented by the following nonlinear differential equation for an -link rigid manipulator: where: Â·

( ) +  ( ,  ) +  ( ) + (,  ,  ) = ()

(3.1)

the joint position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively. Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· ( ) is an  Ã  inertia matrix.

 =  () ,  =  () ,  =  () are functions of time and are  Ã 1 vectors representing

 ( ,  ) is an  Ã  matrix containing the centrifugal-Coriolis terms.  ( ) is an  Ã 1 vector of gravitational torques or forces. () is an  Ã 1 vector of the joint torques or forces. (,  ,  ) is an  Ã 1 vector representing friction, uncertainty, disturbance terms.

acceleration, respectively. By submitting Eqs. (3.2) into Eq. (3.1) the dynamic model can be rewritten in terms of tracking error as follows: ( ) +  ( ,  ) =  () - ()  () = ( )  +  ( ,  )  +  ( ) + (,  ,  )

where  () ,   () ,   () are the vectors of desired joint position, velocity, and

where  () is the desired input torque. For trajectory tracking control of rigid robotic manipulators a PD controller can be implemented as () =  () =  () +   () (3.4)



(3.3)

respectively. It is seen that PD control is easy to implement as it does not require any previous knowledge of the specific system dynamics and requires only the tracking error of the system in order to compute the control torque. As such, it provides model-free linear feedback control for the system and is well-known to obtain acceptable tracking performance.

where the positive definite matrices  and  are the proportional and derivative gains,

29

3.3

SMC FORMULATION
For standard sliding mode control, the tracking errors are redefined as follows: () = () -  ()  () =  () -   ()  () =  () -   ()

(3.5)

Note that this is essentially the opposite of the tracking error defined for standard PD/PID control. Using Eq. (3.5) as the definition of tracking errors, define the sliding surface and its time derivative as: () =  () + ()  () =  () +  ()

where  = [1 , ... ,  ] is a matrix containing the vector of slopes of the sliding surface, known as bandwidths, of the SMC and 1 , ... ,  are strictly positive constants. Define reference states as:   () =  () - () =   () - ()   () =  () -  () =   () -  ()



(3.6)

By submitting Eq. (3.5) to Eq. (3.7), into Eq. (3.1), the dynamic model can be rewritten in terms of the newly defined vector :



(3.7)

Eq. (3.8) represents the system dynamics if the dynamic parameters are known exactly. Since in practice, the system dynamics parameters can never be defined exactly, the SMC law must take the deviations from the actual dynamics into account.

( ) +  (,  ) = () - ( )  -  (,  )  -  ( ) - (,  ,  )

 ( ,  ) -  ( ,  )  (,  ) = 

 (,  ) , and   ( ) are the estimations of the dynamic properties of the system  ( ) ,  where  ( ),  (,  ), and  ( ), respectively. Submitting Eq. (3.9) to Eq. (3.11) into Eq. (3.8), the dynamic equation is rewritten as:  +  - (,  ,  ) ( ) +  ( ,  ) =  -   =   ( ,  )  +   ()  ( )  +   (3.12)

where

(3.13) (3.14)

From this formulation, a standard SMC law can be written using the estimated system dynamic parameters in the form of Eq. (2.7) as:  (,  )  +   ( ) -  ()  ( )  +   () =  (3.15)

 = ( )  +  (,  )  +  ( )

where the positive definite matrix  is a control parameter and () is the sign function defined as: -1   < 0 () =  0   = 0 1   > 0

HYBRID PD SLIDING MODE CONTROL FORMULATION
From the previous sections, one can see that both PD control and SMC have their

advantages and drawbacks. The problem, then, is combining these two different control methods in order to obtain a new control system. This section details the development of the new proposed hybrid control system. 3.4.1 Principle for Hybridization

There are two principles for the hybridization of two control systems: the complementary principle and the compatibility principle (Ouyang, 2005). The complementary principle states that two control systems can be integrated when the strengths of one of them correspond to and

32

will address the weaknesses of the other. The converse also applies with the strengths of the other one corresponding to the weaknesses of the first. The compatibility principle states that the two control systems must be adjusted to minimize their side effects. Here lies the integration and stability problem. From this discussion one can see that the complementary principle gives a necessary condition for two control systems to be integrated while the compatibility principle gives a sufficient condition for the integration. 3.4.2 Formulation

The strengths and weaknesses of PD controllers and SMC can be summarized as follows. Standard PD controllers are very easy to implement since they use a model-free approach, yet they yield relatively low tracking performance due to their linear nature. On the other hand, SMC has high tracking performance but requires that the dynamics of the system be known a priori. The dynamic parameters of a system, however, may not be readily available or are difficult to obtain. As such, it is also sensitive to the unmodeled dynamics of the system. In order to solve the inherent drawbacks of both systems, the following PD sliding mode control (PD-SMC) law is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of rigid robotic manipulators:  () =  () +   () +  () where for an -link manipulator: Â· Â·  = () +  () (3.17)

 is the  Ã 1 vector of sliding surfaces.

() and  () are the  Ã 1 vectors of position and velocity errors, respectively.

Remark 1: The tracking errors for the proposed hybrid system are defined the same way as the tracking errors for PID control, Eq. (3.2). The definition of the sliding surface, , is the Remark 2: Comparing Eq. (3.17) to Eq. (3.15) and Eq. (2.7), as well as Figure 3.2 to Figure 3.1, it can be seen that the model-based equivalent control components in SMC is replaced by PD control in the proposed hybrid PD-SMC. Therefore, the proposed PD-SMC is model-free. Also, PD-SMC is a nonlinear feedback controller due to the switching term of the SMC.

same as Eq. (3.6), but also uses the tracking error definition of PID control, Eq. (3.2).

34

Remark 3: The proposed PD-SMC law has the advantages of both PD control and SMC. First, it is has the ease of implementation of PD control since it is only feedback control. This strength directly corresponds to the weakness of SMC that it is model-based. Second, it contains the nonlinear switching term contributed by SMC to provide improved tracking performance. This corresponds directly to the weakness of PD control that it only has a simple linear nature. Also, it is robust in that it handles uncertainties and external disturbances well as will be demonstrated through simulation verification. Remark 4: Since in the PD-SMC law the strengths and weaknesses of one of the contributing control laws correspond to the weaknesses and strengths, respectively, of the other contributing control law, it satisfies the complementary principle for the hybridization of two control systems. 3.4.3 Properties of the Dynamic Model

A list of properties of a rigid robotic manipulator that are associated with Eq. (3.1) are used for the proposed hybrid PD-SMC law (Craig, 2005). These properties are used in the stability analysis in the following section. The properties are described as follows: P1) The inertia matrix ( ) is symmetric positive definite.

1  ( ) -  (,  ) is a skew symmetric matrix. P2) The matrix 2 

P3) The inertial and the centrifugal-Coriolis matrices satisfy the following relationship:  ( ) =  (,  ) +   ( ,  )  (3.18)

P4) ( ),  ( ,  ),  ( ), and (,  ,  ) are all bounded for bounded inputs. 35

REMARKS
It should be noted that the switching term in the hybrid PD-SMC law Eq. (3.17) is

discontinuous and could introduce chatter in the system. In order to avoid this, a method of

smoothing the controlled input torque will be used by introducing a boundary layer () along with a saturation function (Slotine & Li, 1991). The modified control law is:   () =  () +   () +             1

SIMULATION AND RESULTS

In this chapter, a number of simulations for trajectory tracking control of robot manipulators will be performed based on the proposed hybrid PD-SMC law. To do this, two virtual robotic manipulators will be used. The first manipulator is a three-DOF serial planar manipulator with a 3R configuration. The second manipulator is a two-DOF closed-chain planar manipulator in a parallel 5R configuration. In addition to establishing the mechanisms required for simulation, detailed trajectory planning is performed to ensure smooth motions in all active joints.

TRAJECTORY PLANNING FOR SIMULATIONS
The desired trajectories for each link of the mechanisms are composed of a number of

path segments. The mechanisms exhibit stop-and-go motion for each segment. In order to ensure smooth trajectories for each joint, a fifth order polynomial is used to parametrically establish 46

segment's position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time (Craig, 2005). A constraint is applied that ensures the initial and final velocities and accelerations for each path segment are zero. The fifth-order polynomial is given as:  5  4  3  () = 6   - 15   + 10      respectively, of each segment and are given as:
4 3 2   () = 1 30    - 60    + 30         

(4.3)

The first and second derivative are used for define the desired velocities and accelerations,

where  is the amount of time elapsed into the current segment and  is the total duration of the current path segment. A sampling rate of 500[] was sufficient for contours for the serial contours in order to smooth the control torque. 4.2.1 Linear Contours manipulator, while a higher sampling rate of 5000 [] was used for the parallel manipulator

1  3  2    () = 2 120   - 180   + 60       

(4.4)

Using the parameters defined in Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4), a contour composed of linear segments is defined on the end-effector level. The end-effector Cartesian coordinates are defined by the vector , where  = ( ,  ,  ) for the serial manipulator and  is the pose angle. For the parallel manipulator,  = ( ,  ). Each segment is defined as follows:  () = ( -  ) ()

(4.5)

47

where  () is the desired contour segment vector as a function of time, and  and  are the initial and final values of the contour segment vector, respectively. A series of linear translation segments of the end-effector's Cartesian coordinates comprise the diamond and zigzag contours of the manipulators. Given the desired trajectory of the end-effector, the desired trajectories in the joint space are calculated using the inverse kinematics in the Appendices. The endpoints for each segment of the zigzag and diamond contours for the serial manipulator in the task space are listed in Table 4.3. It should be noted that each segment for the linear contours has a duration of 2 seconds. The joint space positions and velocities for the serial manipulator are listed in Table

4.4. For the parallel manipulator, the contour endpoint information is listed in Table 4.5 for the task space and in Table 4.6 for the joint space. Figure 4.3 to Figure 4.14 show the joint space and task space positions and velocities for both manipulators.

Nonlinear Contours

Nonlinear contours are constructed parametrically as a function of time using an angular parameter defined as:  () = ( -  ) ()

(4.6)

where  and  are the initial and final values of this parameter, respectively. For both the serial of a single movement segment. For each contour,  = 0[] and  = 2 [], indicating a A circular end-effector contour is defined parametrically as a function of time by:  () = 0 +  cos( ())  () = 0 +  sin( ())

and parallel manipulators, circular and elliptical contours are used for the simulation composed

single end-effector revolution with smooth joint motion, as ensured by the definition of ().

where the coordinates (0 , 0 ) are the coordinates of the center of the circle and  represents the radius. The parametric representation of an elliptical contour as a function of time and centered at (0 , 0 ) is similar to that of a circular contour:



(4.7)

where  is the radius of the ellipse along the -axis and  is the radius of the ellipse along the -axis. Eq. (4.8) reduces to the parametric equation of a circle when  =  =  .

 () = 0 +  cos( ())   () = 0 +  sin( ())

(4.8)

The circular contour parameters for the serial manipulator are shown in Table 4.7 while the elliptical contour parameters are shown in Table 4.9. The initial and final coordinates and poses for serial manipulator circular and elliptical contours are given in Table 4.8, where the 56

pose is determined in the same manner as Eq. (4.5). The contour information for the serial manipulator in both the task and joint spaces are shown graphically in Figure 4.15 to Figure 4.20.

Control Parameter Selection

In order to develop an algorithm for the selection of control parameters, the effect of each parameter must first be determined. This was done by varying each parameter one at a time while maintaining the others at a constant. Simulations were performed for the serial manipulator using a both linear (zigzag) contour and a nonlinear (circular) contour in order to establish the effect of each parameter. The mean contour error of the trajectory for each simulation was used 65

as an index to measure the relative performance of the manipulator for each parameter variation. For the simulations, each axis uses equal values to one another for any given control parameter, which means each control parameter is a constant diagonal matrix. The baseline control parameters for this simulation are: 5000  =  0 0 0 5000 0 0 0  5000 0 0 5 1000  =  0 0 0 1000 0 0 0  1000

A boundary layer of  = 0.5 is used for each axis. Table 4.15 shows the ranges of values that were used for each control parameter for the simulations. The increment of each parameter for the following calculation depends on the current value of the parameter. For gains between 0 and 10 the increment is 1, between 10 and 100 the increment is 10, between 100 and 1000 the increment is 100, and between 1000 and 10000 the increment is 1000.

Figure 4.36: Errors for Varying Bandwidths for a Nonlinear Contour

Although equal gains are used for all the active joints, in practice the gains for each joint may differ from one another and may be tuned for individual performance. In this case, it is expected that the gains for axis 2 and axis 3 of the serial manipulator will be smaller than those of axis 1 since the added masses and inertias for the latter axes will require larger control gains for axis 1, the base joint. It should be noted that the behaviour of the system with varying proportional and derivative gains is similar to that of a PD-controlled system. A difference in interpretation, 70

In this regard, instead of the controller being tuned to produce zero tracking error directly, the proportional and derivative gains can be seen as "pushing" the system onto the sliding surface such that  = 0. Also, from the definition of the sliding surface Eq. (3.6), the

bandwidth can be interpreted as a scaling factor for the joint position and velocity errors. As such,  should initially be selected such that the position and velocity errors are of roughly the Based on the observed behaviour of the hybrid control law, the following algorithm can be used for simple tuning of the hybrid PD-SMC law: 1. Set  = 0, and select  and  by trial and error or employing an algorithm for PDtype controllers. 2. Select  such that the position errors are scaled to roughly the same magnitudes as the velocity errors. 3. Increase  until desired contour performance is achieved.

4. Select a boundary layer thickness, , to smooth the control torque input, as desired. 5. Fine tune control parameters, as needed.

Zigzag Contour

Using the controller gains listed in Table 4.16, good axial tracking performance was achieved for all three control schemes: PD, SMC, and PD-SMC in the simulation of the zigzag contour. It should be noted that the means and standard deviations (S.D.) recorded for each of the simulations were calculated from the absolute values of the errors. From the results displayed in Table 4.17, it can be seen that both the SMC and hybrid PD-SMC controller achieve better axial tracking performances than the standard PD controller. Although the PD-SMC controller achieved 44.1% (axis 1), 16.6% (axis 2), and 24.8% (axis 3) smaller mean axial tracking errors

than the PD controller, the SMC controller was able to outperform the PD-SMC controller in

72

both axis 1 and axis 3. The SMC controller, however, achieved an 18% lower mean axial tracking error in axis 2. The joint space tracking errors can also be seen in Figure 4.37.

Figure 4.40: Zigzag Contour Tracking of PD, SMC, and PD-SMC Controllers for Serial Manipulator 1

To further illustrate the relative performance of the control laws, the amount of the motion that falls within a boundary of error of 2(10-4 ) [] was also recorded. That is, the percent of the motion that the magnitude of contour error is smaller than 2(10-4 ) [] is also listed in Table 4.19. While only 42.7% and 65.3% of the points traced along the zigzag contour fall within this boundary of error for the PD and SMC controllers, respectively, 76.0% of the contour errors for the PD-SMC controller are shown to be within this bound. Plots of the desired and actual contours are shown in Figure 4.40. The torque results listed in Table 4.20 show that for axis 1 and axis 3, the SMC controller produced the smallest maximum values of input torque, while the PD-SMC controller produced the largest maximum torques. For the second axis, the maximum input torques remained approximately equal for all three controllers. The torques produced by each of the controllers for each axis is shown in Figure 4.41.

Similar to the zigzag contour, the results of the axial tracking performance for the diamond contour were good for all three simulated controllers. Once again the PD-SMC achieved better axial tracking results than the standard PD controller, as shown in Table 4.21. The PD-SMC yielded lower mean axial tracking errors than the PD controller by 43.7% (axis 1),

16.4% (axis 2), and 23.6% (axis 3). The SMC controller produced the best axial tracking results The standard deviations of the mean errors observed the same trend as the mean error magnitudes. Figure 4.42 shows the tracking errors in the joint space for the diamond contour.

The simulations for the circular contour produced good axial tracking results for each controller, as indicated in Table 4.25. The same trend in relative axial tracking performance is once again present as the SMC controller yielded the best results for both axis 1 and axis 3. While the PD-SMC controller produced an estimated 30% smaller mean error magnitude and

standard deviation of this error than the standard PD controller in these axes, the SMC controller yielded 30% and 20% smaller mean error magnitudes than the PD-SMC controller in axis 1 and axis 3, respectively. However, the PD-SMC controller once again had the best performance in axis 2, producing 16.4% and 26.6% smaller mean error magnitudes than the PD and SMC controllers, respectively.

The PD-SMC controller produced better end-effector tracking results than the PD controller in both the  and  axes by 33.9% and 22.5%, respectively, in terms of the mean error magnitudes. The SMC controller, however, yielded better results than the PD-SMC in these fields by about 2% and 9% in the  and  axes, respectively. In terms of total task space

Figure 4.48: End-Effector Task Space Tracking Error for Circular Motion of the Serial Manipulator

It should be noted that for all nonlinear contours, the contour error was estimated by locally approximating the curve as a circle and using Eq. (2.10). The results listed in Table 4.27 indicate that the contour tracking performance of the PD-SMC controller is superior to both the PD and SMC controllers. The mean of the magnitudes of the contour error for the PD-SMC controller is 16.8% smaller than that of the PD controller and 24.3% smaller than that of the SMC controller. The standard deviation of these errors for the PD-SMC controller also yielded the best results of the three controllers. Both the SMC and PD-SMC controllers produced a more than 15% smaller standard deviation of contour error magnitudes than the standard PD

controller. Also, for the performance of this circular contour, the contour errors yield about 84.5% of all points smaller than a 2(10-4 ) [] contour error for the PD controller, 85.4% for

the SMC controller, and 88.4% for the PD-SMC controller. The contour errors for the 83

simulations are displayed in Figure 4.49 while the desired and actual plots are displayed in Figure 4.50.

The maximum torques required for each controller are listed in Table 4.28.

From the maximum torque results listed in Table 4.41, it is shown that the PD-SMC yielded the smallest maximum torque requirement for both controlled axes. The SMC yielded the highest maximum torque for axis 2, while the PD yielded the highest maximum torque for axis 1. Input torque performance for the diamond contour is displayed in Figure 4.66 4.4.3 Circular Contour

For the circular contour, the PD-SMC achieved the best axial tracking performance by producing the smallest mean axial tracking errors and standard deviations in each of the four axes. From Table 4.42 it can be seen that in terms of mean axial tracking error, the PD-SMC outperformed the PD controller by 10% - 20%. Compared to the SMC controller, the PD-SMC performed marginally better in axis 2 and more than 40% better in axis 1. In terms of task space tracking error, the PD-SMC once again performed better than the PD and SMC controllers by yielding a smaller mean total tracking error by 17.5% and 16.1%, respectively. These results are listed in Table 4.43 while the task space tracking error performance can be seen in Figure 4.68.

Figure 4.68: End-Effector Task Space Tracking Error for Circular Motion of the Parallel Manipulator

From the results of the contour tracking performance listed in Table 4.44, the SMC controller is shown to have yielded the smallest magnitude of mean contour error. The PD-SMC controller has a smaller mean than the PD controller by 19.3%, but the SMC has a smaller mean

than the PD-SMC by 3.4%. Despite having a smaller mean contour error, the SMC controller also yielded the largest standard deviation of these errors. The standard deviation for the PD controller is 14.2% smaller than that of the SMC while the PD-SMC produced a smaller

standard deviation than the SMC by 26.6%. Despite the smaller standard deviation of contour

of error for the SMC controller, as shown in Table 4.44. The PD-SMC controller yields the most amount of the motion within the error boundary. The contour errors and actual contour plots are shown in Figure 4.69 and Figure 4.70, respectively.

Similar to the circular contour results, the PD-SMC produced the smallest mean axial tracking errors in each axis for the horizontal elliptical contours, despite producing larger standard deviations of this error than the SMC controller. The axial tracking error mean and standard deviation results are listed in Table 4.46 while the axial performance results are displayed in Figure 4.72. As shown in Table 4.47, the PD-SMC achieved a better end-effector task space tracking error mean than both the PD and SMC controller by about 15%. The SMC produced the largest 103

Moderate contour performance for the horizontal ellipse was achieved by each of the controllers using the controller gains listed in Table 4.33. The PD-SMC controller, however, remained the best performer of the three controllers by achieving the smallest mean contour error magnitude and standard deviation, as listed in Table 4.48. Again, the PD-SMC controller yielded the most contour errors to fall within an error boundary of 1.5(10-4 ) [] for the performance of Figure 4.74 while the desired and actual plots of the contour are displayed in Figure 4.75.

The SMC controller achieved a smaller standard deviation of axial tracking error than the PD-SMC controller by 21%, but the PD-SMC controller yielded the smallest standard deviations in each of the other axes. The axial tracking performance of each of the controllers is shown in Figure 4.77.

Figure 4.78: End-Effector Task Space Tracking Error for Vertical Elliptical Motion of the Parallel Manipulator

From the results shown in Table 4.52, it can be seen that the SMC and PD-SMC controllers produced similar mean contour error magnitudes and marginally different standard deviations for the vertical elliptical contour. Since the mean contour errors and standard deviations are similar for each controller, there is not a significant deviation when comparing the distribution of the contour errors within the 1.5(10-4 ) [] error boundary. However, the PDSMC still maintained better contour tracking performance than each other the other controllers. The contour errors of the controllers can be seen in Figure 4.79 while the desired and actual plots are displayed in Figure 4.80.

OTHER SIMULATIONS
In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed controller, simulations with

higher-speed movement and simulations with an additional payload at the end-effector were carried out under the same control parameters used in previous simulations. For these simulations, the elliptical contour of the serial manipulator was selected because it was for this contour that the best contour tracking performance was achieved. In addition, the vertical elliptical contour for the parallel manipulator was also simulated since similar performance was exhibited by every controller so the relative robustness of the controllers will be highlighted. Simulations for these contours were also performed with increased gains for which they were

111

previously tuned in order to further verify the improved performance and robustness of the PDSMC controller. 4.5.1 High-Speed Movement Simulations

For each of the simulated high-speed cases, the total duration of the movement was reduced to 25% of the originally simulated duration time as outlined in Section 4.2. For the serial manipulator this means that the total duration of the movement was reduced to 2 seconds. The contour tracking performance for the serial manipulator for the high-speed case is listed in Table 4.54 and displayed in Figure 4.82. For the parallel manipulator, the total movement duration was reduced to 1 second. The contour tracking results for the parallel manipulator are shown in Table 4.55 and Figure 4.83.

Figure 4.87: Contour Error for Motion with a High PD Gains for Parallel Manipulator

Since there are no PD gains for the SMC controller, the performance results for the SMC controller are identical to those of the initial simulation for this movement. The means of the contour error magnitudes, as well as the standard deviations for these errors, for the PD controller in both the serial and parallel manipulator decreased by about 33%. For the PD-SMC

controller the mean contour errors decreased more than 25% for both the serial and parallel

manipulator. The standard deviation of the contour errors for the serial manipulator decreased by 20% . For the parallel manipulator, the standard deviation decreased by 30% . These results verify that increasing the PD gains generally improves performance for the PD and PD-SMC controllers, as previously indicated in Section 4.2.3.

An increase in the SMC control parameters yielded smaller mean contour errors for the PD-SMC controller. For the serial manipulator the mean contour error magnitude was reduced by 24% and for the parallel manipulator it was reduced by 20%. For the SMC controller, the

controller, however, retained the best contour tracking performance for the serial manipulator.

mean contour error magnitudes were reduced by more than 50% in each case. The PD-SMC

Although the SMC controller produced the best results for the parallel manipulator, the PD-SMC controller also demonstrated improved performance and the difference in performances remain only marginal. This large change in performance, however, shows the sensitivity of the SMC controller to changes in the gains. This further verifies the good contour tracking performance and superior robustness of the PD-SMC controller to changes and uncertainties in the dynamics of the system.

REMARKS
The simulation results indicate a general improvement in tracking and contouring

performance of the proposed hybrid PD-SMC controller over standard PD and SMC control schemes. It should be noted that for the SMC controller, theoretically perfect tracking can be achieved if the dynamics of the system are perfectly known (Slotine & Li, 1991). However, with the addition of simulated estimations of the system dynamics, as well as the addition of a boundary layer for trajectory smoothing, the PD-SMC achieved overall better contour tracking performance. For the serial manipulator, the PD-SMC controller produced an average of 27% lower

mean contour error magnitudes up to 44% lower than the PD controller. The PD-SMC controller 119

also yielded an average of 21% smaller mean contour error magnitudes than the SMC controller.

In terms of the standard deviation of these errors, the PD-SMC controller produced roughly 15% SMC controller. For the parallel manipulator the PD-SMC controller produced up to 20%

to 50% smaller values than the standard PD controller and 10% to 50% smaller values than the

smaller mean contour errors than the PD controller and up to 14% smaller mean values than the SMC controller. Comparing standard deviations of contour error magnitudes, the PD-SMC controller produced an average of 20% smaller standard deviation values than both the PD and SMC controllers. A comparison of the mean contour errors is shown in Figure 4.90 and Figure 4.91 for the serial and parallel manipulators, respectively. It was also demonstrated that the maximum torques required for the serial manipulator were generally lower for the PD and PD-SMC controllers than the SMC controller, with the exception of axis 1. For the parallel manipulator, the torque requirements were about equal for each controller. However, it should be noted that for the PD-SMC controller there was higher control activity demonstrated by a fluctuating input torque. This controller activity was smoothed by using a higher sampling rate and can be smoothed further by further increasing the sampling rate. Because the input torques, as well as the maximum torque values, were similar for each controller, it indicates that the power requirements for the proposed PD-SMC controller are similar to those standard PD and SMC controllers.

The results from the high-speed motion, end-effector payload, and higher gain simulations demonstrated the robustness of the proposed PD-SMC controller. The SMC controller was shown to be highly sensitive to the changes in the dynamic parameters of the system while the PD-SMC controller maintained good contour tracking results despite the changes to the initial dynamics for which it was originally tuned.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

GENERAL REVIEW
In this thesis, a new control law was proposed for the control of multi-DOF robotic

manipulators. This was done by the hybridization of two control systems: PD and SMC. By satisfying the complementary and compatibility principles of the hybridization of control systems, the weaknesses of each of the existing control systems are complemented by the inherent strength of the other. As a result, the proposed hybrid PD-SMC law provides an intuitive, model-free alternative to the SMC law as well as improved tracking performance relative to the standard PD controller with the introduction of a nonlinear switching term. The stability of the proposed PD-SMC law was demonstrated with the Lyapunov method. Simulations using linear and nonlinear contours were conducted using the new control law for a planar serial 3R manipulator and a planar parallel 5R manipulator. The tracking and contour performances of the PD-SMC law were compared to the performances of the PD and SMC control laws. By introducing simulated estimations of the system dynamics, uncertainties from friction and other unmodeled dynamics were added to the SMC simulations. The PD-SMC law demonstrated significant improvement in tracking performance relative to standard PD control while producing comparable performance to the SMC law. It was shown that in the cases where the SMC law produced smaller tracking errors, it did not necessarily result in better contouring performance. The PD-SMC law demonstrated consistent improvement over the other controllers in terms of contour tracking performance. With the addition of higher-speed movements and end-effector payloads, it was further shown that the PD-SMC maintained good contour tracking results. The robustness of the 122

proposed law was especially evident when compared to the SMC law, which showed significantly degraded performance quality when introduced to unmodeled dynamics. The PDSMC law consistently demonstrated marked improvements in both contouring performance and robustness over the other two control laws.

MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS
The following contributions are made in this thesis: Â· An alternative to standard PD control with the inclusion of a nonlinear switching term. Â· A model-free alternative to standard SMC law with control parameters that have intuitive meanings for simple tuning. Â· Easily implemented, robust control law with improved tracking and contouring performances for robotic manipulators for linear and nonlinear contours.

5.3

FUTURE WORK
The work presented in this thesis shows that a hybridized control law can provide

intuitive and model-free control of robotic manipulators with improved tracking and contouring performance over PD control and improved robustness over SMC control. Further work should be carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness for different configurations of robots, such as spatial manipulators. Tracking of arbitrary contours should also be explored. Next, experimental results should be obtained to validate the practical application of the proposed control law. Finally, as position domain controllers increase in popularity, the proposed law may be 123

transformed into the position domain where using master axis motion as an independent reference instead of time can further improve contouring performance.
