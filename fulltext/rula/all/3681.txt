Abstract

FASHIONING SUSTAINABILITY: DRAWING LESSONS FROM THE FAIR TRADE COFFEE INDUSTRY Master of Applied Science, 2015 Anne Pringle Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University Due to the fashion industry's global reach, spanning many jurisdictions, regulations are difficult to implement, monitor and enforce. Strict voluntary initiatives that focus on raising consumer awareness, thereby creating greater demand for eco fashion have greater potential to lead to reform within the fashion industry. To do so, voluntary initiatives must include clear labeling of `eco' products and designer input, and include strict guidelines for company and designer standards. Standards must take the entire life cycle of a garment into consideration. Fashion can apply lesson from the fair trade coffee industry by appealing to consumers based on ethics and environmental responsibility through a trusted consumerfacing label. Fair trade was successful, in part, due to their recognizable label. Fair trade type certifications are most often business to consumer facing and provide consumers with the environmental and social information on the benefits of purchasing fair trade. Fair trade certification models have capitalized on large retailer involvement, allowing certifications to become mainstreamed and therefore more accessible for consumers.

Chapter  1:    
1.1  Introduction  
Dressing   is   often   an   international   experience.   Clothing   often   travels   great   distances   before   finding   a   home   in   our   closets   and   draped   on   our   backs.   From   production   to   consumption,   clothing   travels   the   globe,   and   personal   style   is   frequently   influenced   by   a   diversity   of   cultures,   norms   and   traditions.   Fashion   functions   as   a   form   of   personal   and   artistic   expression,   and   can   function   as   a   way   to   express   oneself  to  one's  surrounding  community.  Fashion  is  often  celebrated  for  its  creativity  and  artistic  nature;   however,  until  recently,  little  attention  was  paid  to  the  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the   industry.        Fashion   is   a   major   component   of   the   world   economy,   requiring   vast   amounts   of   resources   to   supply   the   demand.  Consumers  spent  an  estimated  1  trillion  USD  on  apparel  in  2000  with  7%  of  all  world  exports  as   apparel  (Allwood,  2006).    The  fashion  industry  plays  a  significant  role  in  the  world  economy;  however,   within  the  realm  of  sustainability,  the  industry  commonly  operates  in  a  way  that  is  detrimental  to  the   environment.  Most  pressing,  the  fashion  industry  uses  excessive  amounts  of  water,  releases  toxins  into   water  supplies  via  dye  baths  and  insecticides,  and  generates  waste  throughout  production  and  energy   use  on  both  the  producer  and  consumer  end.  The  environmental  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry  are  felt   throughout  three  stages;  textile  production,  manufacturing  and  consumer  use  and  disposal.     The   textile   industry   is   one   of   the   industries   with   the   longest   and   most   complicated   industrial   chains   of   the   manufacturing   industry.   It   involves   actors   from   the   agricultural,   chemical   fiber,   textile,  and  apparel  industries,  retail  and  services  sector,  and  waste  treatment.  The  industry  is   fragmented   and   heterogeneous,   dominated   by   small   and   medium   enterprises   (SMEs)   which   account  for  more  than  80%  of  the  market  (European  Commission  Report,  2011,  p.  4)      Textile   production   often   generates   the   greatest   environmental   impacts   throughout   the   fashion   supply   chain.    Cotton,  the  most  widely  used  textile  in  the  fashion  industry,  is  often  referred  to  as  the  `dirtiest   crop'   as   it   covers   only   2.5%   of   cultivated   land,   yet   uses   16%   of   all   insecticides   sprayed   worldwide   (Salerno-Kochan,  2008).  Cotton  production  uses  the  third  highest  amount  of  pesticides  worldwide  with   over   81   million   pounds   sprayed   each   year   in   the   US   alone   (USDA,   1999).   In   addition   to   the   negative   environmental  impacts  of  harvesting  cotton,  the  invasive  dyeing  process  of  cotton  fabrics  creates  toxic   waste.  Cotton  production  generates  environmental  damages  through  the  prominent  use  of  pesticides,   fertilizers  and  crop  defoliants  (Kadolph,  2010).

   The  stages  for  cotton  textile  production  are:  agriculture,  fiber  production,  processing  yarn  preparation,   fabric   production,   bleaching,   dyeing   and   printing   and   finishing.   Each   stage   creates   waste   requiring   proper  management  and  has  the  potential  for  overall  waste  reduction  (MIGA  1996).  Water  consumption   and  toxic  wastewater  remain  the  greatest  sources  of  environmental  degradation  in  cotton  production.   Throughout  the  cotton  production  process,  the  compounded  average  volume  of  wastewater  created  is   365m3   per   metric   tonne   (TÃ¼fekci,   2007).   Despite   depleting   global   water   resources   and   the   known   negative  impacts  of  conventional  cotton  production,  cotton  remains  the  choice  fabric  for  designers  and   retailers  due  to  its  versatility.      Cotton  production  processes  require  massive  amounts  of  water,  thereby  stressing  and  depleting  water   resources.   Twenty   gallons   of   water   are   required   to   produce   one   pound   of   product   suitable   for   textile   production   (Rehman   &   Shafiq,   2000).   Cotton   generates   pollution   throughout   the   production   chain   resulting   in   toxic   wastewater,   air   pollution   and   solid   waste.   Much   of   the   cotton   production   process   involves   the   use   of   solvents   in   the   wet   processing.   These   solvents   create   pollution   mainly   in   the   form   of   emissions   of   volatile   organic   compounds   (VOC)   created   through   the   dyeing   and   finishing   processes   (MIGA,   1996).      Wastewater   is   a   toxic   byproduct   of   cotton   processing   created   from   the   dyeing   process   and   pesticide   use   during   the   agricultural   phase.      Air   emissions   generated   throughout   the   production   process   include:   dust   particles,   oil   mists,   acid   vapors   and   odors   (MIGA   1996).   According   to   the   World   Bank,  17-20%  of  industrial  water  pollution  is  due  to  the  dyeing  and  treatment  of  textiles.      In  many  textile  operations  waste  from  seam  cutting  and  trimming  account  for  more  than  2%  of  fabric   produced   resulting   in   several   thousand   yards   of   fabric   waste   per   week   in   a   factory   that   produces   a   million  yards  of  fabric  per  week  (EPA  1996).    The  US  produces  800  million  yards  of  denim  (made  from   cotton)   each   year,   equaling   roughly   1.5   billion   pounds   of   denim.   Cutting   efficiency   for   denim   ranges   from   72-94%,   averaging   at   an   84%   efficiency   rate.   Therefore,   cutting   waste   from   denim   in   the   US   accounts   for   100   million   pounds   of   solid   waste   alone   (EPA   1996).   Solid   waste   is   generated   in   both   production  phase  and  consumer  phase  in  the  lifecycle  of  cotton  garments.      Consumer   use   and   disposal   of   fashion   generates   environmental   impact.   In   the   U.S.   each   year   4.5   million   tonnes   of   clothing   and   footwear   are   produced,   requiring   millions   of   gallons   of   water   for   production.   Currently,   garments   are   created   quickly   and   poorly   often   ending   up   in   the   landfill   within   a   year   of

   Voluntary  initiatives  have  become  a  focal  point  for  retailers  as  a  way  to  address  the  environmental  and   social   concerns.   Apparel   and   textiles   closely   tie   the   developed   and   developing   world   together.   The   developing  world  produces  half  of  all  textiles  exports  and  three  quarters  of  the  world's  clothing  exports.     In   addition,   the   textiles   and   apparel   industries   provide   26.5   million   people   with   work;   this   excludes   those   working   in   retail   or   supporting   sectors   (Allwood,   2006).      The   industry   transcends   borders   and   sectors,  directly  impacting  the  livelihoods  of  millions  of  producers  and  their  families.      Globalization  presents  a  duality  for  the  fashion  industry.  On  one  side,  globalization  has  led,  in  part,  to   the   diversification   of   the   fashion   industry   where   companies   subcontract   their   work   to   developing   countries  due  to  more  lenient  environmental  laws  and  cheaper  labour.  On  the  other  side,  globalization   has  led  individuals  around  the  world  feel  more  connected  to  each  other.  Through  the  Internet  and  social   media,  including  twitter,  YouTube,  Facebook  and  Instagram,  consumers  are  connected  more  than  ever   to  the  brands  they  purchase.    Globalization  has  led  to  provide  communication  tools  and  a  network  for   NGO  campaigns  to  strengthen  their  message  and  reach  more  consumers.  Following  the  collapse  of  Rana   Plaza,   images   of   the   tragedy   made   their   way   around   the   globe   instantly,   resulting   in   outrage   from   consumers.   The   connectedness   of   the   world   through   social   media   could   play   an   integral   role   in   strengthening  a  voluntary  initiative  for  the  fashion  industry.        The   subcontracting   of   the   manufacturing   phase   is   done   independently   of   the   company,   making   monitoring   the   process   more   difficult   for   designers   and   retailers.      On   an   international   scale,   subcontracting  manufacturing  to  factories  offshore  often  makes  monitoring  difficult  to  implement  and   uphold.   Due   to   the   often   less   stringent   environmental   laws   where   fashion   is   manufactured   and   the   transient   nature   of   fashion   where   garments   traverse   multiple   borders   throughout   their   lifecycle,   regulation  is  difficult.  Voluntary  initiatives  could  provide  the  mechanism  to  address  the  environmental   issues  presented  by  the  fashion  industry.  As  of  yet,  there  does  not  seem  to  be  a  holistic  and  cohesive   voluntary  initiative  that  addresses  the  entire  lifecycle  of  the  fashion  industry.        The   fashion   industry   was   built   on   a   history   of   poor   working   conditions   and   an   emphasis   on   financially   efficient   manufacturing,   often   resulting   in   processes   that   are   harmful   to   the   environment.   While   the   fashion   industry   has   always   generated   negative   environmental   impacts,   today's   fast   fashion   model,   defined  as  affordable  basics  and  disposable  trends  produced  quickly  in  a  cost  efficient  manner  (Cachon

&  Swinney,  2011),  accentuates  these  impacts.  Fast  fashion  produces  incredible  product  variety  created   by   a   complex   and   long   supply   chain   with   short   product   life   cycles   and   unpredictable   demand   (Siegle,   2011).   The   fashion   industry   as   we   understand   it   today   is   a   product   of   the   modern   age.   Prior   to   the   mid- 19th  century  most  clothing  was  custom  made  for  individuals  by  either  dressmakers  or  tailors.  With  the   invention  of  the  sewing  machine  in  the  early  20th  century  and  the  rise  of  global  capitalism  the  fashion   industry   began   to   shift   towards   ready   to   wear   clothing.   The   development   of   factories   and   the   growth   of   department  stores  and  retail  outlets  allowed  clothing  to  become  mass-produced.  This  eventually  gave   way  to  offshore  manufacturing,  with  multinational  setting  up  factories  in  developing  countries  in  order   to   decrease   labour   costs.   As   the   fashion   industry   has   evolved   it   has   become   increasingly   global.   The   diversification   of   the   fashion   supply   chain   has   given   way   to   the   current   fast   fashion   model,   where   production  often  happens  at  subcontracted  factories.    Garments  are  now  created  by  fabrics  that  might   have  been  grown  in  the  US,  milled  in  India,  sewn  in  China  and  sold  to  the  Canadian  market.        Over  the  past  two  decades,  fashion  has  become  increasingly  available  across  all  socio-economic  sectors   due  to  the  development  of  `fast  fashion'  (Klein,  2012).  Fast  fashion  continues  to  dominate  retail  sales.   The   evolution   of   the   fashion   industry   has   led   to   today's   fast   fashion   industry   where   over   52   micro- seasons  exist  (Siegle,  2011).  The  development  of  fast  fashion  has  led  to  an  increase  in  fashion  purchases   with   Canadians   spending   an   average   of   21.5   billion   on   apparel   and   footwear   each   year.   Clothing   purchase  costs  account  for  5.8%  of  total  expenditure  (Statistics  Canada,  2009).  This  increase  in  demand   for   fast   fashion   has   led   to   increase   the   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   generated   by   the   fashion  sector.  The  recent  move  toward  fast  fashion  has  accentuated  these  environmental  impacts  by   creating  cheap  fashion  that  consumers  are  purchasing  at  an  ever-increasing  rate.  The  industry  in  general   is   environmentally   intensive   and,   `fast   fashion'   is   simply   the   latest   manifestation   of   the   industry.   This   increases   environmental   impacts   throughout   the   manufacturing   supply   chain   (textile   production   and   manufacturing)  and  most  notably  in  the  end-of-life,  disposal  phase.        Regulation   of   the   global   fashion   industry   involves   actors   from   government,   civil   society,   the   private   sector,   consumers,   designers,   academics   and   the   agricultural   sector   and   others   in   a   complex   series   of   inter-relationships.   Due   to   its   complexity   and   the   difficulty   of   international   monitoring,   there   exists   a   myriad  of  certification  codes  and  voluntary  initiatives  for  the  fashion  industry.  Yet  these  codes  remain   fragmented,   rather   than   applying   a   cohesive   approach   analyzing   the   entire   supply   chain   right   from   agriculture   through   to   consumption   and   disposal   (Gam,   2007).   The   Greenpeace   Detox   Challenge,

launched   in   2011   calls   on   companies   to   become   toxic   free   by   reducing   toxic   effluents   by   2020   (Greenpeace,   2011).      The   Better   Cotton   Initiative   (BCI)   promotes   the   use   of   organic   cotton   in   conventional  apparel  processes  (Better  Cotton  Initiative).  Others  focus  on  improving  the  social  element   of  the  fashion  industry;  such  as  Fair  trade  Certification  of  cotton  and  factories.  The  Sustainable  Apparel   Coalition   is   an   industry   led   campaign   that   addresses   both   social   and   environmental   impacts   along   the   fashion   supply   chain.   However,   the   Sustainable   Apparel   Coalition   is   self-monitored   and   regulated   by   participating  industry  members,  leaving  consumers  wary  of  green  washing.        International  regulation  for  the  fashion  industry  has  yet  to  be  implemented.  For  example,  Canada  lacks  a   regulatory   process   within   the   fashion   industry   to   both   monitor   and   uphold   environmental   and   social   protection   laws   internationally.   The   fashion   industry's   international   reach,   transcending   multiple   jurisdictions,   makes   regulation   difficult   to   implement,   monitor   and   enforce   (Gam,   2007).   Regulation   can   function  as  a  tool  for  policy  reform,  however;  strict  regulation  such  as  `command  and  control'  regulation   is   a   rigid,   and   one   size   fits   all   approach   that   often   does   not   encourage   innovation   within   industries.   Voluntary   initiatives   that   encourage   innovation   for   within   the   industry   are   need   to   work   with   regulatory   reform.   Command   and   control   regulation   can   also   lead   to   a   `free   license'   to   pollute   to   those   in   compliance  with  standards,  consequently  not  encouraging  innovation  (Greenbaum  &  Wellington,  2010).   The   multitude   of   stakeholders   within   the   fashion   sector,   spanning   multiple   jurisdictions,   from   consumers,   farmers,   designers,   and   producers   to   legislators   and   policy   officials   may   prove   to   make   regulation   ineffective   and   very   costly   to   monitor.   Scientists   can   help   create   clarity   in   this   arena   for   consumers   by   providing   a   straightforward   analysis   of   the   negative   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.   Scientific   expertise   is   needed   in   order   to   create   an   informed   public   who   can   then   take   the   conscious   steps   to   advocate   and   demand   for   corporate   compliance   to   standards   within   the   textiles   industry  (Gam,  2007).      Currently,  regulations  involving  the  use  of  certain  toxic  chemicals  exist  but  are  very  difficult  to  uphold.     For  example,  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  regulated  the  use  of  carcinogenic  azo-dyes  both  for  their  use   within   EU   countries   and   for   the   importation   from   any   country   that   used   azo-dyes   in   their   processing   (Rehman   T.   et   al.,   2000).      Canada   has   expressed   concern   regarding   the   use   of   azo-dyes   proven   to   be   carcinogenic.   However,   regulations   have   yet   to   be   implemented   to   enforce   and   monitor   when   textile   production  occurs  internationally.  Canada  lacks  strict  regulatory  reform  for  detecting  and  prohibiting  the   importation  of  textiles  contaminated  by  azo  dyes.

   While   there   exists   a   myriad   of   sustainable   and   socially   conscious   initiatives,   it   appears   there   currently   lacks  a  comprehensive  code  that  addresses  the  entire  lifecycle  of  a  garments  from  creation  to  disposal.   Addressing  the  lifecycle  of  a  garment  is  integral  to  addressing  environmental  concerns  throughout  the   supply  chain  (Kozlowski,  Bardecki  &  Searcy,  2012).    This  paper  will  address  issues  highlighted  in  existing   apparel   codes,   specifically   focusing   on   cotton   production   and   highlight   the   deficiencies.   The   current   amount   of   codes   and   initiatives   in   existence   can   lead   to   audit   fatigue,   are   not   well   marketed,   lack   a   similar   language   and   are   not   trusted   or   known   by   consumers   (Gam,   2007).   The   fashion   industry   often   operates   to   the   detriment   of   the   natural   environment   due   to   a   lack   of   regulation   throughout   the   supply   chain.   In   addition,   within   the   fashion   industry   sustainability   has   often   been   perceived   as   an   obstacle   rather  than  an  economic  choice  for  fashion  designers  and  retailers  (Siegle,  2011).       

1.2  Hypothesis  

If   the   fashion   industry   adopts   strict*   voluntary   initiatives   that   focus   on   raising   consumer   awareness,   thereby  creating  greater  demand  for  eco  fashion  then  there  is  greater  potential  to  lead  to  reform  within   the   fashion   industry.   To   do   so,   voluntary   initiatives   must   include   clear   labeling   of   `eco'   products   and   designer   input,   combined   with   strict   guidelines   for   company   and   designer   standards.  Providing   transparency   throughout   the   supply   chain   in   conjunction   with   designer   and   retailer   promotion   of   stylish   &  sustainable  fashion  could  lead  the  fashion  industry  to  shift  towards  wider  adaptation/implemention  of   sustainable  practices  (Ashby,  Hudson  Smith  &  Shand,  2013).  If  the  fashion  industry  adopts  lessons  from   the   fair   trade   coffee   industry,   it   could   appeal   to   conscientious   consumers   with   the   guarantee   that   by   purchasing   sustainable   fashion   the   value   is   shared   throughout   the   supply   chain,   mitigating   environmental  damage  caused  by  manufacturing.

This  study  will  research  the  feasibility  of  mainstreaming  sustainable  fashion  by  looking  at  the  business   case   for   sustainable   fashion.      Research   looks   at   existing   voluntary   initiatives  within  the  Canadian  textiles   industry   in   regards   to   sustainable   (eco-friendly   and   ethical)   fashion.   This   research   aims   to   illuminate   the   shortcomings   of   existing   voluntary   initiatives   and   make   suggestions   for   reform.   Research   will   focus   on   issues  such  as  how  voluntary  initiatives  are  understood  at  both  the  industry  and  consumer  level  and  the   potential  role  designers  and  retailers  can  play  in  shaping  industry  sustainability  standards.      This  study  aims  to  investigate  how  fair  trade  type  certification  and  labeling  for  coffee,  a  successful  and   more  comprehensive  voluntary  initiative  with  clear  messaging,  can  function  within  the  fashion  industry   to   make   it   easier   for   retailers,   designers,   consumers   and   manufacturers   to   participate.   Therefore,   potential  benefits  of  this  paper  include  the  potential  for  the  greater  incorporation  of  the  fair  trade  type   labels  for  fashion,  in  order  to  generate  consumer  confidence  in  sustainable  fashion.  The  fair  trade  label   is   proposed   as   an   umbrella   term   that   will   make   it   easier   for   manufacturers,   retailers,   designers   and   consumers  alike  to  understand  the  social  and  environmental  benefits  of  sustainable  fashion.    Research   will  look  at  companies  that  are  compliant  with  fair  trade  type  certification  programs.        Voluntary   initiatives   (VI)   are   becoming   progressively   more   prevalent   in   consumer   society   and   have   become  increasingly  important  over  the  past  20  years.  VI  represent  an  underlying  shift  or  trend  in  the   market   reflecting   the   legal   structure   of   the   market   place.   An   increase   in   voluntary   initiatives   demonstrates   the   demand   side   looking   for   indications   that   a   product   has   sustainable   characteristics.   Voluntary   initiatives   can   function   as   a   systematic   approach   to   structuring   environmental,   social   and   economic  impacts  of  a  product  (Webb,  1999).    FLO  remains  a  major  player  in  the  production  and  sales  of   sustainable   coffee.   In   2012,   FLO   represented   10%   of   total   certified   or   verified   production   and   5%   of   global   coffee   production   (Potts   et   al,   2014).   The   fashion   industry   has   begun   to   take   note   with   Patagonia

and   MEC   launching   Fair   trade   lines   in   2014   and   Oliberte   becoming   the   first   Fair   trade   Certified   shoe   factory  in  Africa.        Like  what  Fair  trade  type  certifications  did  for  coffee,  the  fashion  industry  can  adopt  a  single  umbrella   term  and  labeling  to  clearly  outline  and  define  sustainability  in  the  fashion  industry.  To  do  so,  a  VI  for   the  fashion  industry  must  include  clear  labeling  of  `eco'  products  and  designer  input,  and  include  strict   guidelines   for   company   and   designer   standards.   To   be   successful,   standards   must   take   the   entire   life   cycle  of  a  garment  into  consideration  (Kozlowski,  Bardecki  &  Searcy,  2012).        Research  will  track  trends  in  sustainability  reporting  among  five  (5)  prominent  fashion  retailers  between   2009   and   2013.   Trends   will   be   tracked   based   on   word   usage   in   corporate   social   responsibility   reports   and  specific  environmental  targets  set  out  by  the  retailers  investigated.       

1.5.  Scope  
This   research   critically   examines   the   existing   fashion   industry,   highlighting   areas   of   improvement   that   current  voluntary  initiatives  (V.I.)  relevant  to  the  fashion  industry  can  address.   Their  shortcomings  will   be   assessed   and   will   be   compared   with   the   well-established   and   mainstreamed   fair   trade   type   certification   for   coffee.      The   research   looks   beyond   voluntary   initiatives   in   the   fashion   industry   to   fair   trade  type  labeling  for  insights  and  ideas  learned  as  voluntary  initiatives  for  the  fashion  industry  are  an   emerging  field  (Gardetti  &  Torres,  2013).  In  chapter  5  research  will  critically  assess  current  programs  to   determine   where   reform   could   be   most   beneficial.      Additionally,   research   will   examine   which   policy   tools  are  most  effective  to  achieve  greater  environmental  awareness,  thereby  lessening  the  deleterious   global   impact   of   the   fashion   industry.   The   paper   will   discuss   how   and   if   voluntary   initiatives   and   consumer   demand   for   `eco-friendly'   fashion   can   be   an   effective   means   to   lead   to   an   increase   in   the   creation  and  consumption  of  sustainable  fashion.  Research  looks  to  illuminate  the  unique  role  designers   and  retailers  can  play  in  order  to  help  initiate  this  change.        Fair   trade-type   certification   programs   refers   to   third   party   certification   programs   that   address   both   social  and  environmental  issues.  Fair  trade  type  certification  includes  Fair  Trade  USA  (formerly  TransFair)   Fair  trade  International  (FLO),  UTZ  and  4C  Association.  These  fair  trade  type  programs  have  developed  a   set   of   standards   addressing   ethical   and   environmental   issues   throughout   the   coffee   supply   chain,   and   assure  conformity  with  these  standards  through  third  party  monitoring.  Fair  Trade  USA,  FLO,  UTZ  and  4C

Association   will   be   discussed   further   in   chapter   5.   Initiatives   were   chosen   from   State   of   Sustainability   Initiatives  (SSI)  2014  report  (Potts  et  al,  2014).  Launched  in  2008,  SSI  releases  leading  industry  reviews   through  a  partnership  between  the  International  Institute  for  Environment  and  Development  (IIED)  and   Aidenvironment.      In   order   to   address   the   above   research   questions,   research   will   rely   on   industry   reports   of   fashion   retailers   who   have   released   public   reports   and   documents   for   the   reporting   periods   from   2009-2013.   Research  will  highlight  key  trends  across  five  (5)  leading  brands,  Adidas,  Gildan,  H&M,  Inditex  and  NIKE,   in  sustainable  fashion  and  cross-reference  their  claims  against  reporting  and  benchmarking  metrics  by   Sustainalytics   Top   50   Socially   Responsible   Corporations   2014.   Following   the   identification   of   key   sustainable  players  in  the  fashion  industry,  research  will  undertake  three  methodologies:      1. Qualitative   Content   Analysis   of   publicly   available   sustainability   reports   from   the   reporting   periods  of  2008-2012  using  NVivo  Software  to  demonstrate  trends  in  reports.   2. Lesson-drawing   from   fair   trade   type   certification   schemes   for   the   coffee   industry   that   the   fashion  industry  can  adopt  and  learn  from.   3. Highlight   leading   brands,   Marks   &   Spencer   and   Patagonia   to   demonstrate   the   feasibility   of   sustainable  fashion.     Current  voluntary  initiatives  for  the  fashion  industry  will  be  highlighted  in  comparison  to  fair  trade-type   certification   through   lesson   drawing.   The   fair   trade   label   has   become   a   recognizable   and   trusted   label   among  consumers,  specifically  for  coffee,  tea,  chocolate  and  sugar  (Fair  Trade  Canada,  2012).  As  such,   the  Fair  trade  labeling  and  certification  will  be  used  to  compare  and  contrast  current  initiatives  within   the   fashion   sector.   Fair   trade   coffee   and   the   fashion   industry   share   similarities   as   both   deal   with   consumable   goods   often   produced   in   a   developing   nation   where   environmental   and   labour   standards   are   lower   than   where   they   are   sold   in   the   market   (Fair   Trade   Canada,   2012).   Fair   trade   functions   as   a   comparable  initiative  for  the  fashion  industry  and  can  provide  insight  through  lessons  learned  that  the   fashion  industry  can  adopt.    Fair  trade  certification  and  labeling  initiatives  are  not  without  their  faults;   these  faults  will  be  highlighted  throughout  the  research.      Fair   trade   certification   is   a   business   to   consumer   model   allowing   retailers   to   function   as   proxies   for   consumers.   Since   its   official   inception   in   1997,   Fair   trade   has   gained   a   remarkable   part   of   the   market   place  for  sustainable  purchasing.  Fair  trade  products  and  sales  continue  to  increase  yearly.  Fair  trade  has

extended   to   coffee,   sugar,   tea,   chocolate   and   even   cotton   (Fair   Trade   Canada,2012).   Fair   trade   coffee   in   particular  was  chosen  to  compare  to  the  fashion  industry,  specifically  cotton  production,  as  both  coffee   and   cotton   present   similarities.   While   the   comparison   is   not   perfect,   the   similarities   outnumber   the   differences.    Coffee  and  cotton  are  both  resource  intensive  crops  requiring  vast  amounts  of  water  and   pesticides.   Both   coffee   and   cotton   are   agricultural   crops   relying   on   low   cost   labour,   predominantly   in   developing  countries,  with  the  exception  of  some  cotton  grown  in  the  US.  Coffee  was  chosen  over  the   organic  food  movement,  as  consumers  do  not  directly  link  sustainable  coffee  or  sustainable  cotton  and   clothing   with   health.   Sustainable   fashion   must   appeal   to   consumers   on   the   grounds   of   ethics   and   environmental  sustainability  the  way  fair  trade  coffee  has.    They  do  present   some   differences;  there   are   specific   coffee   retail   shops   that   engage   directly   with   consumers   while   there   are   no   cotton   shops.   However,  there  are  sustainable  fashion  retailers  that  can  engage  directly  with  consumers,  the  way  small   fair  trade  coffee  shops  have,  thus  acting  as  proxies  for  consumers.          In  order  to  properly  compare  the  fashion  initiatives  to  that  of  fair  trade  certification  a  set  of  guidelines   has   been   developed   Voluntary   initiatives   will   be   assessed   based   on   the   following:   mission,   history,   commercial   conditions,   supply   chain   traceability,   certification   method,   and   consumer   communication   and   retailer   involvement.   Research   will   seek   to   demonstrate   that   `green'   methods   adopted   for   the   manufacturing   of   cotton   can   prove   to   be   beneficial   for   the   apparel   industry,   consumers   and   the   environment   alike   (Moore,   2004).   Creating   a   straightforward   labeling   process,   one   that   adheres   to   a   comprehensive  voluntary  initiative,  will  help  to  inform  consumers  on  how  to  purchase  more  sustainable   products.  According  to  Gam  (2007)  consumers  are  willing  to  purchase  `green'  (sustainable)  products,  but   are   often   confused   by   labels.   A   number   of   consumers   appear   to   find   product   labels   hard   to   understand.   Research  has  found  that  there  are  consumers  who  will  buy  lower  quality  green  products  in  comparison   to   alternative   products,   but   only   when   environmental   information   is   clearly   stated   on   labels   (D'Souza   et   al.,   2006).   Price   sensitive   eco   consumers,   who   claim   to   always   read   labels,   expressed   that   when   purchasing   `eco'   products,   their   decisions   are   based   on   sufficient   and   straightforward   information   displayed   on   product   labels   (D'Souza   et   al.,   2006).   Retailers   can   help   in   the   process   by   acting   as   an   important  proxy  for  consumers.       

1.6  Assumptions:  
Eco-fashion,   while   still   a   niche   market,   is   a   growing   trend.   As   consumer   awareness   of   the   harmful   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry   increases,   consumers   and   NGOs   are   beginning   to   pressure   companies   to

take  greater  responsibility  to  develop  sustainable  practices.  Despite  this  rising  awareness,  consumers  do   continue   to   purchase   cheap,   `fast'   fashion   in   large   quantities   and   it   continues   to   dominate   retail   sales   (Cachon   &   Swinney,   2011).   While   consumers   are   slowly   becoming   increasingly   aware   of   the   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry   there   continues   to   be   a   dichotomy   between   what  consumers  claim  they  want  versus  what  is  actually  purchased  (Gam,  2007).  The  desire  to  acquire   the   newest   trend   at   the   cheapest   price   remains   the   driving   factor   for   the   majority   of   consumers   who   spend   an   estimated   $21.5   billion   on   fashion   each   year   (Stats   Canada,   2009).   Research   assumes   that   fast   fashion  will  continue  to  remain  the  prevalent  driving  force  of  the  fashion  industry;  therefore,  addressing   the   large   fast   fashion   retailers   is   imperative   to   mitigating   the   environmental   risks   associated   with   the   fashion   industry.   Research   also   assumes,   that   clear   labels   demonstrating   greater   transparency   throughout  the  supply  chain  will  generate  greater  consumer  confidence  in  sustainable  fashion  and  lead   to  an  increase  of  consumer  purchasing  of  sustainable  fashion.        The   current   fast   fashion   model   is   based   on   the   selling   the   newest   trend,   and   research   assumes   that   sustainable   fashion   will   continue   to   gain   momentum   as   large   retailers,   designers,   celebrities   and   academics   are   beginning   to   shed   more   light   on   the   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.      Mainstream   sustainable   fashion   is   catching   on,   and   is   gaining   momentum   each   fashion   season.   Research   assumes   that  fast  fashion  retailers  will  continue  to  engage  with  sustainable  initiatives  and  continue  to  report  on   their  environmental  impacts.     

1.7  Limitations:  
Textile   production   and   manufacturing   is   a   large   and   diverse   industry,   transcending   multiple   jurisdictions   and   making   monitoring   difficult   (Gam,   2007).   The   limitations   in   research   include   the   difficulty   of   accurately  monitoring  regulation  for  the  fashion  industry  on  an  international  scale.    Research  will  focus   primarily   on   voluntary   initiatives   rather   than   regulatory   processes,   as   regulation   across   multiple   jurisdictions  is  difficult  to  monitor  and  uphold.        A  wide  variety  of  fabrics  are  used  within  the  fashion  industry,  both  synthetic  and  organic.  Each  textile   generates  an  environmental  and  social  impact  throughout  their  supply  chain.  The  use  of  synthetic  fibers   such  as  polyester  and  nylon  release  significant  amounts  of  Green  House  Gases  (GHG)  through  the  use  of   fossil  fuel  (DEFRA,  2011)  and  are  non-biodegradable.  For  the  purpose  of  this  paper  research  will  focus  on   the   use   of   cotton,   the   most   widely   used   fiber   for   garment   production.   Cotton   generates   significant

impacts  throughout  its  supply  chain  through  waste,  energy,  water  and  pesticides.  More  environmentally   friendly   options   of   cotton   are   becoming   more   available   with   the   likes   of   organic   cotton   and   better   cotton   (through   the   Better   Cotton   Initiative).   Research   looks   to   highlight   advances   made   in   the   production  of  sustainable  cotton.      Many  voluntary  initiatives  exist  that  address  environmental  and  or  social  concerns.  The  building  sector   has   LEED   certification,   the   paper   sector   has   FSC   certification,   and   the   Diamond   industry   has   the   Kimberely   Accord.   All   are   voluntary   based   initiatives   aimed   to   improve   either   the   social   or   environmental  standards  within  their  industry.  For  the  purpose  of  this  research,  fair  trade  type  coffee   certification  was  chosen  over  other  labels;  as  fair  trade  has  already  begun  to  integrate  with  the  fashion   industry,  specifically  cotton.  Cotton  and  coffee  offer  many  parallels  and  allow  for  a  comparison  between   the  two  industries.  Further  information  on  the  comparison  of  coffee  and  cotton  is  provided  in  Chapters   3  and  5.        Five   fashion   retailers   selling   in   Canada   are   highlighted   for   their   sustainable   initiatives   and   their   environmental   commitments.   Their   CSR   reports   are   compared   and   analyzed   based   on   the   firms'   environmental   commitments   to   energy,   waste,   water   and   CO2.   The   five   retailers   provide   a   sample   of   fashion  retailers  but  offer  limitations  as  all  are  either  fast  fashion  specialty  retailers  (H&M  and  Inditex),   or   sports   apparel   retailers   (Adidas,   Gildan   and   NIKE).   Research   did   not   track   trends   among   small,   independent  designers  or  high-end  fashion  retailers,  but  instead  focused  on  fast  fashion.        The  fashion  industry  presents  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts,  however,  while  this  paper  will   briefly  highlight  areas  of  social  concern,  the  main  focus  will  remain  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  the   fashion   industry.   It   is   important   to   note   that   a   comprehensive   voluntary   initiative   and   code   for   the   fashion   industry   must   incorporate   both   strict   environmental   and   social   standards   (Ashby,   Hudson   Smith   &   Shand   2013).   Fair   trade   type   certification   models   incorporate   both   social   and   environmental   standards   and   are   currently   used   for   a   variety   of   agricultural   products   including   a   small   amount   of   cotton  production.  

1.8  Working  Definitions  
1.8.1  Sustainability  
There   are   many   definitions   for   sustainability.   For   the   purpose   of   this   research,   the   definitions   as   set   forth  by  the  Brundtland  Report  in  1987  will  be  used.  The  Brundtland  Report  states  that  sustainability  is  a  

  

13  

process   that   `meets   the   needs   of   the   present   generation   without   compromising   the   ability   of   future   generations  to  meet  their  own  needs'  (UN  1987).  This  paper  will  examine  the  potential  intergenerational   effects   of   current   fast   fashion   by   investigating   the   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   of   the   long-term  implications  of  the  fashion  industry.  Sustainable  fashion,  as  discussed  in  this  thesis,  refers  to  a   process,   which   respects   people   and   the   planet   while   remaining   economically   feasible.   Sustainable   fashion   encompasses   the   entire   supply   chain-from   agricultural   production,   fiber   processing,   design,   retail  and  consumption.  Sustainable  fashion  looks  at  environmental  protection,  protection  for  workers   involved  throughout  the  supply  chain  and  at  economic  efficiency.     

1.8.2  Sustainable  Fashion:  
Sustainable   fashion   is   a   process   that   respects   the   people   and   planet   while   remaining   economically   feasible.  Sustainable  fashion  encompasses  the  entire  supply  chain  from  agricultural  production  to  fiber   processing,  design,  retail  and  consumption.     Relating  the  concept  of  sustainability  to  clothing  means  that  ideally  this  would  be  clothing  which   meets  the  needs  of  today's  consumers,  and  is  also  made,  transported,  sold,  used  and  disposed   of  in  ways  which  do  not  adversely  impact  people  or  the  planet  Â­  now  or  at  any  time  in  the  future     (DEFRA  2011  pp3).   The  International  Standards  Organization  (ISO)  has  defined  eco-fashion  as     Identifying  the  general  environmental  performance  of  a  product  within  a  product  group  based   on   its   whole   life-cycle   in   order   to   contribute   to   improvements   in   key   environmental   measures   and  to  support  sustainable  consumption  patterns.      Table  1.1  below  outlines  how  the  sample  set  of  retailers  each  define  sustainability.      Retailer   Adidas     2013  CSR  report   Definition   Four   pillars   of   sustainability;   people,   product,   planet   and   partnership.  Responsibility  to  be  fair  to  future  generations  and   improve   systems   and   processes   so   that   Adidas   and   supplier   cause  less  harm  to  the  planet.     `For   us,   sustainability   is   a   word   of   action.   A   mission   that   is   built   on   passion,   long-term   thinking   and   teamwork.   Everything   we   do   needs   to   be   economically,   socially   and   environmentally   sustainable.  All  equally  important  for  our  future  growth'  (p.5)   `Sustainability   means   the   seamless   and   supported   integration   of   our   business   model   in   the   community.   It   means   taking   a   long-term   approach   with   the   aim   of   adding   value   to   society'   Pablo  Isla,  Chairman  of  Inditex

1.8.3  Fast  Fashion    
Refers   to   cheap   alternatives   that   mimic   luxury   brands.      Fast   fashion   offers   affordable   basics   and   disposable  trends  produced  quickly  and  in  a  cost  efficient  manner  (Cachon  &  Swinney,  2011).  The  low- cost   clothing   based   on   the   latest   trends,   is   by   nature   a   fast-response   system   that   encourages   disposability  (Fletcher,  2007).  Once  an  industry  that  relied  on  Spring/Summer  and  Fall/Winter  seasons,   fast   fashion   now   hosts   52   micro   seasons.   Large   retailers   such   as   H&M   and   Forever   21   receive   daily   shipments  of  garments  and  TopShop  boasts  400  new  styles  online  each  week  (Siegle,  2011).     

1.8.4  Slow  Fashion  
Slow  fashion  is  not  a  seasonal  trend  that  comes  and  goes,  but  a  sustainable  fashion  movement  that  is   gaining   momentum.   Slow   fashion   looks   at   the   entire   lifecycle   of   a   garment,   promoting   sustainability   throughout  the  supply  chain.  It  encourages  education  about  the  garment  industry's  connection  to  and   impact   on   the   environment   and   depleting   resources.   Slow   fashion   promotes   a   slowing   down   of   the   supply   chain   to   reduce   the   number   of   trends   and   seasons,   to   encourage   quality   of   production,   and   return   a   greater   value   to   garments   by   removing   the   image   of   disposability   of   fashion.  Slow   fashion   promotes  quality  over  quantity  (Fletcher,  2007).

1.8.5  Voluntary  Initiative  
Any   non-mandatory,   rules   based   partnership   or   collaboration   among   multiple   supply   chain   stakeholders   aimed   at   improving   the   social,   economic   and   environmental   sustainability   of   commodity   production   and/or   trade   (Giovannucci   et   al.,   2008).   Examples   include   Better   Cotton   Initiative,   Sustainable   Apparel   Coalition,   GOTS,   NICE   and   Fair   trade.   Existing   voluntary   initiatives   (VI)   will   be   discussed   and   examined   in   chapter  6.       

1.8.6  Certification  
Certification   is   the   process   of   verifying   that   an   industry   player   is   meeting   the   rigorous   standards   (throughout  their  supply  chain)  that  will  then  enable  them  and/or  their  products  to  be  labeled  i.e.   Fair   trade   or   Organic.   Certifications   can   be   part   of   a   voluntary   initiative,   but   not   all   voluntary   initiatives   have   certification  schemes.     

1.8.7  Fashion  vs.  Apparel    
For  the  purpose  of  this  study  the  term  fashion,  rather  than  apparel  will  be  used  when  referring  to  the   entire      `industry'   surrounding   the   product   cycle   from   design   to   consumption.   The   aim   of   this   paper   is   to   investigate  the  possibility  of  mainstreaming  sustainable  fashion  for  style  and  function.  Therefore,  for  the   purpose  of  this  paper  the  term  `fashion'  will  be  used  as  it  refers  to  both  style  and  function  of  a  garment.

In   academic   literature   the   terms   fashion,   garment   and   apparel   industry   are   used   interchangeably.   All   three  terms  refer  to  the  clothing  manufacturing  industry  and  supply  chain.  However,  the  term  fashion   seems  to  insinuate  the  notion  of  curated  design  and  intention  behind  the  creation  of  a  garment.  Fashion   represents   the   way   clothing   communicates   our   individuality   within   society   (Fletcher   2008).   Fashion   is   often  thought  of  as  frivolous  or  decadent  with  an  emphasis  on  style.  The  fashion  industry  comes  with  an   entire  media  and  marketing  team  behind  it.  Fashion  represents  the  aesthetic  of  dressing  for  more  than   function.  In  comparison,  the  term  apparel  is  used  when  referring  to  basics  and  functional  wear,  it  does   not  conjure  images  of  style  and  glamour  the  way  fashion  does.  `Fashion  can  be  defined  as  discarding  of   clothes   that   are   fully   functional   for   purely   semiotic   or   symbolic   reasons'   (Koefoed   and   Skove   updated   in   Gardettin  &  Toress,  2013,  p.  6).  

  1.9  Conclusion  
The   fashion   industry   presents   considerable   environmental   and   social   impacts   throughout   its   supply   chain.   The   following   chapters   will   address   the   impacts   and   the   roles   retailers   can   play   as   proxies   for   consumers   by   informing   consumers   through   generating   greater   awareness   of   these   impacts   and   providing   sustainable   alternatives.   Chapter   two,   the   literature   review,   outlines   the   negative   environmental   impacts   and   illustrates   the   improvements   being   made   by   the   sustainable   fashion   industry.   The   literature   review   examines   fair   trade-type   certification   as   a   comparison   for   sustainable   fashion.    Chapter  three  outlines  the  methodology  used  throughout  the  paper,  a  mixed  method  approach   including  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis.  Chapter  four  provides  a  content  analysis,  analyzing   the  CSR  reports  of  five  major  fashion  retailers  to  demonstrate  trends  in  sustainability  reporting.  Chapter   five  draws  on  lessons  from  the  fair  trade  coffee  industry,  looking  to  apply  lessons  from  fair  trade  type   certification   to   the   fashion   industry.   Chapter   six   examines   the   role   retailers   can   play   as   proxies   for   consumers   by   highlighting   two   leaders   in   the   sustainable   fashion   industry;   Marks   &   Spencer,   a   fast   fashion  brand  and  Patagonia,  an  outdoor  apparel  brand.    

Chapter  2  
2.1  Introduction  
A   review   of   the   literature   provides   considerable   evidence   that   there   are   significant   negative   environmental  and  social  impacts  in  the  making  of  textiles,  from  the  manufacturing  of  garments  through   to  the  consumption  and  disposal  by  consumers.  Increasingly  there  is  recognition  of  the  significance  of   the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry  by  consumers  through  media  coverage  and   NGO  campaigns.  Consumers,  designers,  academic  institutions  and  retailers  alike  are  beginning  to  place   greater   emphasis   on   the   importance   of   sustainability   in   the   fashion   sector.   The   volume   of   voluntary

initiatives   and   codes   of   conduct   promoting   a   more   sustainable   fashion   industry   have   been   on   the   rise   since   the   1990s   (Ashby,   Hudson   Smith   &   Shand   2013).      Some   of   these   initiatives   include,   but   are   not   limited  to,  the  Clean  Clothes  Campaign,  Better  Cotton  Initiative,  Labour  Behind  the  Label,  Greenpeace   Detox   Campaign,   EcoCert   and   the   Ethical   Trading   Initiative   (Goworek   2001,   Ashby,   Hudson   Smith   &   Shand   2013).   Research   demonstrates   that   in   response   to   the   growing   awareness   of   the   negative   environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry,  retailers  and  designers  are  taking  part  in  these   voluntary   initiatives   and   adhering   to   their   standards.   However,   while   there   exists   a   large   number   of   voluntary  initiatives  directed  at  improving  the  negative  environmental  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry,   there   has   yet   to   be   a   comprehensive   voluntary   initiative   addressing   both   environmental   and   social   issues   covering   the   entire   lifecycle   of   a   garment   that   is   user   friendly   to   producer,   consumer,   designer   and  retailer  alike.  In  order  to  accelerate  sustainable  fashion,  the  fashion  industry  needs  to  look  at  the   entire   lifecycle,   from   fiber   harvesting   to   disposal,   in   order   to   promote   a   process   that   assesses   the   impacts  generated  across  all  aspects  of  the  industry  (Cataldi  et  al  2013).    This  paper  will  present  the  case   that   the   fashion   industry   can   draw   lessons   from   the   fair   trade   coffee   movement   that   could   lead   to   better  inform  their  business  practices  and  engage  with  consumers  on  a  wider  scale.        The  increase  in  voluntary  initiatives  in  consumable  goods,  specifically  those  centered  on  social  issues  like   fair   pay,   have   begun   to   garner   increased   consumer   support.      Literatures   shows   that   fair   trade-type   certified  coffee  addresses  both  the  environmental  and  social  issues  and  presents  a  cohesive  certification   initiative.   Fair   trade   offers   better   trading   conditions   for   coffee   farmers   and   engages   in   supporting   producers   and   sustainable   farming   practices   through   education   and   training   programs.   Fair   trade   prohibits  the  use  of  child  or  forced  labour,  an  issue  the  fashion  industry  faces.  Globally,  since  2000,  fair   trade  purchases  have  increased  20%  annually  and  in  Canada  fair  trade  products  have  increased  by  85%   from   2003-2007.   In   2012,   430,000   metric   tonnes   of   fair   trade   certified   coffee   were   produced,   making   coffee  the  third  largest  producer  of  sustainably  compliant  coffee  on  the  market  (Potts  et  al.,  2014).  Since   the  fair  trade  Labeling  Organization  International  (FLO)  was  created  in  1997,  the  number  of  certified  fair   trade   producers   tripled   by   2007   and   sales   have   increased   by   40%   annually   (Fair   trade   Labeling   Organization   International   2007).   Literature   illustrates   that   fair   trade   has   moved   to   a   more   mainstreamed  movement,  taking  a  sizeable  portion  of  the  market  place.    Fair  trade  coffee  demonstrates   the   success   of   an   initiative   with   clear   messaging   and   objectives   from   a   consumer   and   retailer   perspective.    Coffee  with  fair  trade-type  certification  led  in  market  penetration,  reaching  40%  of  global   market   share   in   2013.   Sustainable   cotton   saw   a   55%   increase   of   production   from   2012   to   2013   (Potts   et

al.,   2014).      Literature   demonstrates   that   retailers   played   a   role   in   in   the   rising   popularity   of   fair   trade   coffee.  Starbucks  introduced  Fair  Trade  Certified  coffee  to  their  consumers  in  2000  and  purchased  0.6   million   pounds   of   fair   trade   coffee   (Jaffee,   2012).   Starbucks   acted   as   a   proxy   for   its   consumers   by   acting   on  behalf  of  its  consumers  to  provide  environmentally  and  socially  responsible  options.        Since   the   1992   Rio   Earth   Summit,   stakeholders   from   all   segments   of   the   global   economy   have   placed   emphasis   on   improving   sustainability   standards.   The   Rio   Summit   called   for   greater   attention   to   sustainable   production   and   consumption.   There   now   exist   over   400   consumer   facing   eco-labels   penetrating   the   market   (Potts   et   al.,   2014).   These   labels   and   voluntary   initiatives   have   proven   incremental  in  improving  transparency  across  supply  chains  while  promoting  efficiency  and  consistency   in  their  efforts  to  address  issues  of  environmental  and  social  concern  (Potts  et  al.,  2014).    While  there   has   been   increase   in   consumer-facing   labels   and   the   production   of   `standard   compliant'   products,   production  currently  exceeds  consumption  and  demand  (SSI  Review,  2014).  While  standards  have  done   a  relatively  good  job  at  strengthening  the  reliability  of  market  claims  through  increased  monitoring  and   have   created   new   opportunities   for   nontraditional   perspectives   to   enter   the   supply   chain,   special   investment   is   needed   in   order   for   voluntary   initiatives   to   adequately   operate   as   tools   to   reduce   poverty   and   reduce   environmental   impacts   (Potts   et   al.,   2014)   and   to   promote   greater   consciousness   of   consumers  through  the  private  and  public  sector  alike.        Additionally,   academic   awareness   analyzing   the   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion   sector   has   increased   over   the   past   10   years.   Gardetti   &   Torres   (2013)   published   Sustainability   in   Fashion   and   Textiles:  Values,  Design,  Production  and  Consumption   an  academic  text  compiling  peer  reviewed  articles   on   the   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.      A   multitude   of   authors   and   organizations   have   analyzed   the   impact   of   the   fashion   industry   including   Allwood   et   al   (2006),   DEFRA   (2011),   Dickson   et   al   (2009)   and   Portway   &   Lewis   (2012).      In   2007,   the   WWF   commissioned   the   study   financed   by   Marks   and   Spencer   Fashioning   Sustainability:   A   Review   of   Sustainability   Impacts   of   the   Clothing   Industry   conducted   by   Draper,   Murray   and   Weissbrod.   Institutions   are   beginning   to   teach   sustainability   to   their   design   students,   and   in   2011   the   University   in   Berlin   launched   the   first   MA   in   Sustainable   Fashion   Design.     Finally,   industry   leaders   in   sustainable   fashion   have   published   a   number   of   books.   Most   notable,   Sustainable  Fashion  and  Textiles:  Design  Journeys   by  Kate  Fletcher  (2008),  Future  Fashion  White  Pages   (a  collection  of  sustainable  fashion  essays  from  industry  professionals)  by  Leslie  Hoffman  (2008),   To  Die

For:  Is  Fashion   Wearing   out   the   World?  by   Lucy   Siegle   (2011)   and  Overdressed:  The  Shockingly  High  Cost   of  Cheap  Clothes  (2012)  by  Elizabeth  Cline.        While   there   is   a   rise   in   the   awareness   of   the   negative   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry,   they   are   only   just   recently   being   examined   by   scientists   and   therefore   are   not   fully   conveyed   to   policy   makers   and   consumers,  making  the  shift  towards  a  more  eco-conscious  industry  difficult.    We  are  only  just  beginning   to   see   academic   institutions   introduce   sustainable   fashion   into   the   curriculum.   Ryerson   University   in   Toronto,  Canada  has  a  prominent  fashion  department  and  now  offers  classes  in  sustainable  fashion,  but   sustainability  is  not  part  of  the  core  curriculum.  A  study  by  Meyer  (2001)  demonstrates  that  consumers   are  not  willing  to  purchase  green  apparel  products  due  to  the  higher  cost,  reduced  choice,  aesthetic  and   functional  disadvantages,  lack  of  information,  and  uncertainty  about  actual  benefit  to  the  environment.   Consumers   often   lack   adequate   information   to   make   informed   and   eco   conscious   choices   when   purchasing  clothing.      Pollution   prevention   measures   are   imperative   for   the   fashion   industry's   continued   growth.   A   growing   awareness   of   the   negative   environmental   impact   of   fashion   is   generating   an   increase   in   demand   for   sustainable  fashion.  However,  research  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry  remains  in   its  infancy.  In  addition,  a  gap  continues  to  exist  between  what  consumers  say  they  want  and  what  they   actually   purchase.   With   the   end   product   in   mind,   leaders   in   the   textile   industry   should   address   the   growing   concern   regarding   fashion's   detrimental   environmental   impacts   (Gam,   2007).   With   the   aid   of   organizations,  activists  and  concerned  industry  leaders  and  consumers,  there  has  been  a  growing  effort   to  monitor  fashion's  environmental  impact  both  in  its  production  and  consumption  phases  in  order  to   create  fashion  with  both  planet  and  profit  in  mind.      The  fashion  industry  has  begun  to  take  a  look  beyond  the  consumption  of  garments  to  assess  the  impact   of   consumer   waste   generated   by   the   industry.   Both   the   global   apparel   market   and   consumers'   awareness   of   the   positive   effects   of   repurposing   or   refurbishing   (recycling   or   up-cycling)   apparel   on   reducing  environmental  impacts  has  increased  in  the  market  as  the  textile  and  apparel  industries  have   demonstrated   a   substantial   effort   to   increase   the   use   of   recycled   materials. A   handful   of   apparel   industries   have   adopted   McDonough   and   Braungart's   (2002)   `Cradle   to   Cradle'   model   as   a   solution   to   eliminate  many  environmental  problems.    Cradle  to  Cradle  looks  beyond  the  closed  loop  system  and  will   be   addressed   further   in   this   research.   In   addition,   the   use   of   recycled   polyester   (rPET:   recycled

polyethylene  terephthalate),  for  apparel  items  has  been  widely  implemented  by  many  leading  apparel   companies  such  as  Nike,  Under  Armor,  Patagonia  and  Columbia.  Most  commonly,  rPET  is  used  to  make   fleece  garments.        Large   fashion   retailers   and   brands   have   begun   to   address   sustainability   issues   themselves,   most   notably   Patagonia  with  its  use  of  rPET  to  make  fleece  garments,  PUMA  through  its  Environmental  Profit  and  Loss   Report   (2010),   H&M   through   its   partnership   with   the   Better   Cotton   Initiative,   LEVI's   with   its   line   of   recycled  denim  and  NIKE  which  launched  the  Making  App  (2013)  which  allows  retailers  and  designers  to   compare  the  environmental  impacts  of  fibers  across  sectors.        Despite   these   shifts   and   advances,   the   fashion   industry   remains   one   of   the   most   environmentally   and   socially   degrading   industries   (Siegle,   2011).   With   the   exception   of   the   mining   and   agricultural   industries,   few   industries   are   as   connected   to   the   natural   world   as   fashion.   The   fashion   industry   depends   on   water   resources   and   crops   such   as   cotton,   yet   is   only   just   beginning   to   factor   in   the   consequences   of   the   industry   on   the   natural   environment,   which   include   shrinking   biodiversity   and   climate   change   (Siegle,   2011).      In   order   for   sustainability   in   the   fashion   industry   to   really   take   shape,   it   requires   the   use   of   collective   learning   mechanisms   for   stakeholders   across   the   industry   to   create   the   necessary   space   needed   to   determine   a   collective   vision   around   what   a   sustainable   fashion   industry   looks   like   (Cavagnaro  &  Curiel,  2012).       

2.3  Literature  Review:  
2.3.1  Introduction:  
Sustainable  fashion  is  an  emerging  industry  and  academic  field.    The  literature  review  will  highlight  the   negative   environmental   impacts   generated   from   the   making   of   textiles   and   garments   and   from   the   consumption   and   disposal   of   fashion.   The   first   section   of   the   literature   review   will   provide   the   background   information   highlighting   the   negative   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.   Fast   fashion   remains   the   prevailing   force   in   terms   of   sales   in   the   fashion   industry;   therefore,   research   will   look  to  provide  an  understanding  of  the  fast  fashion  landscape.  Due  to  the  breadth  of  textiles  used  in   the   fashion   industry,   research   will   focus   on   the   impacts   of   producing   cotton.   Cotton   represents   the   largest   component   of   fiber   used   in   the   fashion   industry,   with   conventional   cotton   creating   significant   impact   on   the   natural   environment.      The   literature   will   also   highlight   the   lack   of   consumer   awareness   surround  the  negative  impacts  of  the  fast  fashion  industry.

   The  second  part  of  the  literature  review  highlights  the  growing  number  of  sustainable  brands  within  the   fashion  industry  to  showcase  the  groundwork  retailers,  designers  and  NGOs  alike  have  begun  to  do.  In   addition,  key  voluntary  initiatives  addressing  the  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry  and  the  role  they  can   play   in   shaping   the   future   of   the   sustainable   fashion   industry   will   be   addressed.   The   literature   review   will   provide   a   history   of   the   fair   trade   coffee   movement.   Research   undertaken   or   this   paper   that   assesses  the  key  leaders  in  the  sustainable  fashion  industry  and  examines  successful  voluntary  initiatives   in   other   sectors,   like   Fair   trade   coffee,   will   assist   in   the   development   of   proposed   strategies   that   will   provide  the  framework  to  further  address  environmental  concerns  generated  by  the  fashion  industry.       

2.3.2  The  Fast  Fashion  Industry  
Fast   fashion   represents   the   latest   manifestation   of   the   fashion   industry,   accentuating   the   negative   environmental   impacts   generated   by   the   industry   through   the   creation   of   disposable   fashion.   Fashion   is   now   produced   at   an   ever-increasing   rate.   The   consumption   of   fashion   leads   to   an   increase   in   water,   energy,  CO2  and  waste  generated  by  the  industry.  Over  the  past  two  decades  the  fashion  industry  has   dramatically   changed.   `The   emergence   of   the   `fast   fashion'   business   model   has   increased   the   introduction  of  trends  leading  to  premature  product  replacement  and  fashion  obsolescence;  (Kozlowski,   Bardecki  &  Searcy,  2012)  What  used  to  be  an  industry  with  only  Fall/Winter  and  Summer/Spring  seasons   has   transformed   into   an   industry   with   52   micro-seasons   (Siegle,   2011).   Fast   fashion   is   typically   priced   lower   than   high-end   competitors   and   works   on   a   model   of   high   volume/low   quality.   Zara,   the   world's   largest   retailer   receives   two   shipments   a   week   and   H&M   and   Forever21   receives   daily   shipments   of   clothing.        Fast   fashion   promotes   mass   consumption   of   low   quality   goods.   Fast   fashion   items   are   often   made   in   factories   in   developing   countires   where   environmental   and   social   standards   are   not   strictly   upheld.      The   Centre   for   Environmental   Health   (2010)   found   that   Forever21   and   Wet   Seal,   two   fast   fashion   brands,   were   selling   purses   and   belts   that   were   lead   contaminated   above   legal   amounts.   The   Centre   for   Environmental   Health   also   found   traces   of   pesticides,   formaldehyde,   flame-retardants   and   other   known   carcinogens  on  fast  fashion  clothing.       

2.3.3  Environmental  Impacts  of  the  fashion  industry:  
Literature   demonstrates   that   there   are   considerable   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts

generated  through  the  making  of  textiles  and  apparel  and  in  the  consumption  and  disposal  of  garments.   The   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry   are   felt   across   the   entire   supply   chain   and   vary   significantly   depending   on   the   type   of   fiber   used.   Cotton   production   requires   significant   water   and   chemical   use   generating   toxins   through   pesticides   and   fertilizers.   Whereas,   synthetic   fibers   such   as   polyester  and  nylon  release  significant  amounts  of  Green  House  Gases  (GHG)  through  the  use  of  fossil   fuel  (DEFRA,  2011).  The  use  of  petroleum-based  polymer  content  textiles  has  increased  in  recent  years   due   to   their   high   mechanical   and   physical   properties   for   functional   applications   and   price   (Huang   &   Netravali,   2009).   These   materials   use   significant   amounts   of   petroleum,   a   fossil   fuel   that   is   non- renewable  and  in  addition,  a  majority  of  those  synthetic  fibers  are  often  blended  or  non-biodegradable   making  them  difficult  to  recycle.   Textiles  and  their  end  products  constitute  the  world's  second  largest  industry,  ranking  only   below  food  products.  At  least  10%  of  the  world's  productive  energies  are  devoted  to  this  activity   and  a  huge  segment  of  the  global  population  earns  its  living  and  obtains  its  creative  satisfaction   from  the  same  source  (Unknown,  1972).        

  

Cotton  generates  pollution  throughout  the  production  chain  resulting  in  toxic  wastewater,  air  pollution   and   solid   waste.   Much   of   the   cotton   production   process   involves   the   use   of   solvents   in   the   wet   processing.   These   solvents   create   pollution   mainly   in   the   form   of   emissions   of   volatile   organic   compounds   (VOC)   created   through   the   dyeing   and   finishing   processes   (MIGA,   1996).      Wastewater   is   a   toxic   byproduct   of   cotton   processing   created   from   the   dyeing   process   and   pesticide   use   during   the   agricultural  phase.    Air  emissions  generated  throughout  the  production  process  include:  dust  particles,   oil  mists,  acid  vapors  and  odors  (MIGA  ,1996).           

The  negative  environmental  impacts  of  cotton  production  and  processing,  generating  toxic  waste  water,   air  pollution,  solid  waste  and  the  depletion  of  water  resources  in  conjunction  with  the  excessive  use  of   toxic   pesticides   emphasizes   the   industry's   need   for   preventative   measures   (Rehman   &   Shafiq,   2000).   Simply   controlling   the   pollution   is   not   an   adequate   alternative   for   the   textile   industry.   Innovative   preventative  measures  that  seek  to  decrease  the  overall  amount  of  pesticides  and  water  during  cotton   processing  and  those  that  encourage  training  to  increase  cutting  efficiency  in  factories  will  prove  to  be   economically  beneficial  for  companies  and  less  intensive  on  the  natural  environment  (Moore,  2004).

The  creation  of  `fast  fashion'  has  led  to  a  decrease  in  product  quality,  sharply  increasing  postconsumer   textile  product  waste,  resulting  in  a  great  concern  for  waste  management.    In  the  US  16  million  tons  of   textiles   make   their   way   to   landfills   each   year   (EPA,   2010).   The   Council   for   Textile   Recycling   estimates   that  1.14  billion  Kilograms  of  postconsumer  textile  waste  (including  anything  made  of  fabric)  is  collected   and   diverted   from   directly   entering   landfills.   However,   this   diversion   represents   only   4.55kg   for   every   person  in  the  United  States,  or  approximately  15%  of  all  the  clothing  that  is  discarded.    In  the  UK,  the   average  consumer  throws  30kg  of  clothing  into  landfills  each  year  (Allwood  et  al.,  2006).          According   to   the   US   Environmental   Protection   Agency   (EPA),   in   2010,   13   million   tons   of   textile   waste   was  generated,  making  up  5.3%  of  total  municipal  solid  waste.  The  EPA  (2010)  estimates  that  only  14%   of  all  clothing  and  footwear  are  recovered  for  export  or  reprocessing,  and  the  overall  recovery  rate  for   all   textiles   was   15%   (2   million   tons)   in   2010.   Of   the   recovered   textiles   in   2009,   60%   were   exported   abroad,  often  to  underdeveloped  countries  like  Haiti  where  the  imported  textile  waste  is  not  monitored   and  regulated.    In  2009  the  US  exported  approximately  1.4  billion  pounds  of  used  clothing  (EPA,  2010)   The   environmental   impacts   of   garments   do   not   end   with   purchase   by   the   consumer.   Instead,   their   impact  continues  through  the  laundering  process  and  discard  at  the  end  of  life.  The  negative  effects  of   clothing   extend   beyond   the   retail   doors;   major   impacts   of   clothing   are   felt   post-purchase   through   laundering  and  disposal  of  used  garments.  A  1993  study  by  Franklin  and  Associates  found  that  the  major   environmental  impact  in  the  lifecycle  of  a  polyester  blouse  was  felt  during  the  consumer  phase  (Lynn,   2010):   ...as  much  as  82  per  cent  of  energy  use,  66  per  cent  of  solid  waste,  over  half  of  the  emissions  to   air  (for  carbon  dioxide)  and  large  quantities  of  waterborne  effluents  (96  per  cent  if  measured  by   Biological  Oxygen  Demand  alone)  are  amassed  during  washing  and  drying  (Lynn,  2010,  p.1).      An  additional  challenge  lies  in  the  recycling  of  garments.    Material  blends  have  become  popular  fabric   choices,   as   they   are   affordable   and   conventional.   These   hybrids   are   made   of   mixtures   of   technical   nutrients  and  biological  nutrients.  For  example,  cotton-polyester  blends  are  widely  used  for  wrinkle-free   shirts  and  pants.  However,  they  are  neither  biodegradable  nor  recyclable  after  use,  so  they  often  end  up   in   a   landfill.   In   addition,   apparel   products   are   often   constructed   with   mixtures   of   a   few   different   materials   including   thread,   buttons,   zippers,   trims,   etc.,   which   makes   the   garments   difficult   to   disassemble  for  recycling  and  up-cycling.

The  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry  are  felt  on  a  global  scale.  From  production   to   consumption,   a   single   garment   passes   through   many   hands,   traversing   multiple   countries,   consuming   natural   resources   and   human   labour,   most   often   to   the   detriment   of   all   (Cachon   &   Swinney,   2011).   Based   on   current   research   it   appears   Canada   lacks   strict   regulations   to   monitor   and   uphold   environmental   and   social   protection   laws   specifically   within   the   fashion   industry.   Due   to   the   fashion   industry's   global   reach,   spanning   many   jurisdictions,   regulations   are   difficult   to   implement,   monitor   and   enforce  (Gam,  2007).  Strict  voluntary  initiatives  that  focus  on  raising  designer  and  consumer  awareness,   thereby  creating  greater  demand  for  eco  fashion,  could  have  greater  potential  to  lead  to  reform  within   the  fashion  industry.  The  fashion  industry  can  learn  from  the  clear  messaging  and  mainstreaming  of  Fair   Trade  marketing.       

2.3.4  Lack  of  Consumer  Awareness  on  the  Impacts  of  the  Fashion   Industry  
In  the  1990s  there  was  considerable  negative  attention  on  the  fashion  industry  in  large  part  due  to  the   lack   of   social   responsibility   and   accountability   of   factories   located   in   developing   countries   (Kozlowski,   Bardecki  &  Searcy,  2012).    The  delocalized  production  in  developing  nations  led  in  part  to  less  stringent   standards   and   regulations   resulting   in   social   impacts   such   as   poor   working   conditions,   low   wages   and   health  and  safety  issues,  resulting  in  what  are  referred  to  as  `sweatshops'  (Kozlowski,  Bardecki  &  Searcy,   2012).  Media  and  NGO  exposure  of  child  labour  and  sweatshop  factories  in  developing  countries  led  to   an  increase  in  consumer  engagement  and  perceived  fear  in  retailers  of  widespread  boycotts.  This  in  turn   led  in  part  to  a  push  for  industry  reform  thus  demanding  brands  respond  and  be  held  accountable  for   manufacturing   throughout   their   supply   chain.   This   shift   in   reform   was   set   in   motion   by   consumer   demand,   NGO   campaigns   and   designer   and   retail   cooperation.      The   industry   began   to   introduce   new   codes   of   conduct   and   corporate   social   responsibility   (CSR)   standards   to   improve   accountability   (Abernathy  et  al.,  1999;  Klein  2000;  Park  &  Lennon,  2006;  Shaw  et  al  2006;  Kozlowski,  Bardecki  &  Searcy,   2012).   The   use   of   sweatshop   and   child   labour   has   yet   to   be   completely   abolished,   and   the   collapse   of   Rana   Plaza   in   Bangladesh   in   2013   demonstrates   the   issue   still   remains.   However,   the   fashion   industry   as   a   whole   has   seen   improvement   in   these   areas   through   the   adoption   of   sourcing   policies   and   codes   of   conduct   encouraging   greater   accountability   throughout   the   supply   chain.   Most   large   retailers   now   implement   third   party   factory   monitoring   and   reporting.   Just   as   the   fashion   industry   sought   to   rectify   the  negative  labour  issues  associated  with  production  and  manufacturing,  the  industry  needs  to  begin  to   make  reforms  on  their  negative  environmental  impact.

The   consistency   in   green   purchasing   by   industry   leaders   mentioned   above   demonstrates   the   demand   of   green  products  and  services.  However,  while  `green  purchasing'  is  on  the  rise,  fast  fashion  continues  to   dominate  sales.  Consumers  lack  awareness  on  the  negative  health  and  environmental  impacts  of  their   clothing   and   therefore   are   hesitant   to   make   the   switch   to   purchasing   sustainable   fashion.   Price   and   quality   play   a   primary   role   in   purchasing   of   eco   garments.   A   study   by   Nakano   (2001)   found   that   consumers   are   not   willing   to   pay   over   10%   more   for   sustainable   goods,   and   that   consumers   associate   purchasing  `green'  products  with  saving  money.  Alternatively,  a  study  by  Bhaduri  et  al.  (2011)  found  that   there  exists  a  lack  of  trust  in  business  and  retailer  claims  of  sustainability  and  consumers  do  not  want  to   fall  victim  to  `green  washing'  schemes.  Furthermore,  consumers  find  labeling  unclear  and  inconsistent.      There   exists   a   distinct   contradiction   between   the   fashion   culture   and   sustainability.   This   inconsistency   creates   issues   for   the   garment   industry,   and   in   order   to   move   forward   and   address   these   issues   in   a   critical   manner,   public   awareness   and   understanding   of   the   environmental   impacts   of   the   garment   industry  will  play  a  strong  role  in  helping  the  industry  evolve  into  a  more  sustainable  direction  (Bhaduri   &   Ha-Bookshire,   2011).      There   remains   a   distinct   lack   of   communication   to   consumers   generating   confusion   and   a   lack   of   trust   on   the   perceived   environmental   impacts   of   the   clothing   industry.   Third- party  labeling  and  certification  schemes  remain  unclear  and  inconsistent  which  only  adds  to  consumer   confusion  and  lack  of  trust.      The   rise   of   sustainable   fashion   demonstrates   a   greater   awareness   among   both   retailers   and   consumers.   However,   it   remains   difficult   to   accurately   predict   the   future   of   the   sustainable   fashion   industry   and   market   due   to   the   fact   that   purchasing   patterns   are   often   in   contradiction   to   self-professed   values   of   consumers  (Brown,  2011).    There  exists  a  distinct  difference  between  what  consumers  claim  they  value   and   what   they   spend   their   money   on.   Consumers   associate   purchasing   `green'   or   `sustainable'   items   with   saving   money.   While   two   consumers   may   possess   the   same   values   and   morals   their   purchasing   patterns  may  differ.  One  consumer  may  purchase  consciously  to  reflect  their  values  and  the  other  not.   Interaction   ritual   chains   attempt   to   decipher   why   it   is   that   some   consumers   purchase   ethically   while   others   do   not   (Brown,   2011).   Sustainability   in   the   fashion   sector   is   growing   in   awareness,   but   as   sustainable   fashion   production   and   research   remain   in   its   infancy,   the   movement   has   yet   to   gain   widespread  momentum.

Sustainable   fashion   is   a   growing   trend,   with   retailers   and   designers   taking   note   and   addressing   both   the   environmental   and   social   impacts   of   generated   throughout   their   supply   chains.   The   global   sales   of   organic   cotton   have   increased   by   $1   billion   in   2009,   which   amounts   to   a   35%   increase   over   2008   (Organic   Cotton   Report,   Textile   Exchange   2013).   Sales   of   cotton   compliant   with   voluntary   codes   increased   50%   from   2012   to   2013   (SSI   Review,   2014).   This   positive   growth   in   demand   for   organic   cotton   is  an  indication  that  the  size  of  the  sustainable  fashion  market  is  expanding.  Retailer  supply  chains  are   increasingly   being   evaluated   by   reporting   agencies   to   determine   their   level   of   corporate   social   responsibility.   The   notable   publication   March   to   Sustainability   2011:   Profiling   Sustainability   Plans   of   Leading   Brands   and   Retailers   for   their   Global   Textile   Supply   Chains,   illustrates   the   significance   of   the   pressure  put  on  retailers  to  produce  responsibly.        While   sustainable   fashion   was   first   met   with   criticism   by   consumers   in   the   1990s   for   offering   poor   quality   products   at   high   prices,   over   the   past   decade   the   industry   has   seen   a   significant   change   in   terms   of  quality  and  style  offered  by  sustainable  fashion  designers  (Nakano,  2007).    There  currently  are  many   voluntary   initiatives   addressing   the   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry;   however,   to   date   there   exists   no   singular   definition   of   `eco',   `green'   or   `sustainable'   fashion.   The   suggestion   made   here   is   that   because   the  precise  meaning  of  `sustainable  fashion'  is  not  clear,  retailers  have  trouble  promoting  the  notion  of   sustainable  fashion  to  consumers.        Eco-fashion  has  been  on  the  rise  in  terms  of  production,  consumption  and  accessibility  and  continues  to   grow  as  a  fashionable  trend.  Major  retail  conglomerates  such  as  H&M,  Zara  (Inditex)  and  Top  Shop  are   beginning   to   introduce   environmentally   friendly   alternatives,   such   as   organic   cotton   products,   in   their   retail   stores.   High   fashion   designers   are   creating   and   engaging   with   sustainable   fashion.   Vivian   Westwood  introduced  an  ecofriendly  and  ethical  clothing  line  partnering  with  tailors  in  Kenya  in  2011.  In   addition,   sports   apparel   companies   are   taking   a   leading   role   in   the   promotion   of   sustainable   fashion.   Patagonia  has  been  a  longtime  supporter  of  sustainable  fashion,  encouraging  consumers  to  be  conscious   about  their  purchases.  PUMA  released  an  environmental  profit/loss  report  outlining  the  environmental   impacts   of   their   production.   The   sustainable   fashion   movement   has   given   rise   to   smaller,   successful   brands  People  Tree  and  Edun  (Joergens,  2006).

Sustainable   purchases   continue   to   grow   across   all   sectors.   Environmental   data   analysts   at   the   Worldwatch  Institute  (2008)  assessed  capital  flows  in  the  green  sector  at  $100  billion,  with  investments   into  alternative  energies  ringing  in  at  $66  billion  in  2007  and  carbon  trading  transactions  reaching  $30   billion  in  2006.  The  phenomenon  means  more  professionals,  ranging  from  lawyers  to  securities  brokers   to  engineers,  are  putting  an  environmental  focus  on  their  practices  to  help  clients  with  compliance  or   identifying  and  creating  business  opportunities  within  this  vast,  emerging  market.  There  is  beginning  to   be  a  greater  awareness  of  the  impacts  of  the  generated  by  the  garment  industry  both  on  the  people  that   create   our   garments   but   also   on   the   impacts   on   the   natural   environment.   Large   companies   are   beginning  to  take  note  and  implement  sustainability  initiatives  into  their  branding.        The   Multilateral   Investment   Guarantee   Agency   (MIGA,   1996)   set   straightforward   standards   and   guidelines  for  the  textiles  industry  to  adopt  preventative  measures.  These  measures  include  (but  are  not   limited   to):   the   managing   of   batches   in   order   to   minimize   end   waste;   avoiding   non-degradable   or   low   degradable   solvents   in   washing;   using   pad   batch-dyeing   to   save   80%   of   energy   required   and   90%   of   water   consumption;   reducing   overall   salt   and   dye   usage;   avoiding   benzidine-based   azo   dyes   and   chlorine-based   dyes   or   those   containing   heavy   metals;   reusing   dye   solution   from   dye   baths;   and   reusing   and  recovering  process  chemicals  (MIGA,  1996).      While   these   standards   do   exist,   they   have   yet   to   be   fully   implemented   and   adopted   throughout   the   garment   sector.   The   global   reach   of   the   fashion   industry   makes   monitoring   of   standards   difficult   as   a   single   cotton   garment's   life   cycle   process   can   span   many   jurisdictions   (Gam,   2007).   Campaigns   advocating   against   the   use   of   azo-dyes   have   brought   international   attention   to   the   negative   human   and   environmental   impact   of   these   toxic   dyes.   Greenpeace   spearheaded   the   Green   Detox   Challenge   in   2011.Puma,   Adidas,   H&M   and   Nike   have   signed   on   to   the   Greenpeace   Detox   Challenge   -   a   campaign   calling   on   large   fashion   companies   to   sign   on   to   a   `toxic-free'   future,   working   with   all   their   international   and   domestic   suppliers,   to   eliminate   the   release   of   toxic   chemicals   generated   throughout   their   supply   chain   (Greenpeace   Detox   Campaign,   2011).   The   Greenpeace   Detox   campaign   provides   an   example   of   consumer  pressure  leading  to  corporate  reform.      Organizations  such  as  the  Better  Cotton  Initiative  (BCI)  advocate  for  organic  cotton  partnering  with  large   retailers   like   H&M   (BCI,   2010).   BCI   aims   to   inform   consumers   and   to   help   create   transparency   in   the   production  process  of  cotton.  While  BCI  functions  to  support  sustainable  fashion  through  its  promotion

of   organic   cotton,   it   does   not   take   a   comprehensive   and   proactive   approach   in   pollution   prevention   measures   in   the   processing   phase   of   cotton   as   it   simply   criticizes   chemical   use   in   the   agricultural   process,   rather   than   undertaking   an   overall   analysis.   However,   organizations   like   BCI   do   function   to   further   engage   retailers   in   their   supply   chain,   which   in   turn   can   influence   consumers   in   their   fashion   purchases,  increasing  demand  for  organic  or  sustainable  apparel  (Gam,  2007).      Scientists   and   engineers   are   beginning   to   develop   standardized,   reliable   and   relatively   inexpensive   testing   and   evaluation   protocols   for   chemicals   used   on   textiles   (Moore,   2004).   This   functions   to   allow   textile   managers   and   their   chemical   suppliers   to   implement   environmental   decisions   as   part   of   purchasing   processes.   In   addition,   the   development   of   environmental   impact   and   evaluation   methods   allow  cotton  mill  operators  to  include  environmental  impact  assessment  in  their  process  development.   Prior   to   these   preventative   developments,   cost   and   mill   performance   were   the   only   concern   for   determining  purchasing  decisions  (Moore,  2004).        Fast  fashion  industry  leaders  such  as  H&M  have  begun  to  incorporate  sustainable  fashion  lines  into  their   stores.  H&M  launched  the  Conscious  Exclusive  in  150  of  its  retail  stores  in  April  2014  in  partnership  with   the   sustainable-design   think   tank,   Ever   Manifesto   (H&M,   2014).   The   Conscious   Exclusive   collection   provides   sustainably   made   fashion   forward   clothing.   H&M   is   a   global   brand   and   therefore   has   the   opportunity   to   inform   and   raise   awareness   regarding   the   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry   to   a   global   audience.      The   implementation   of   sustainably   compliant   fashion   at   large   retail   brands   demonstrates   the   growth  of  the  sustainable  fashion  industry.        As  sustainable  fashion  continues  to  grow  in  popularity,  there  does  not  yet  exist  a  voluntary  initiative  or   certification   or   label   that   has   generated   widespread   consumer   acceptance   and   trust.   Voluntary   initiatives   can   play   a   pivotal   role   in   influencing   the   fashion   industry   and   providing   consumers   with   a   tool   to  inform  their  purchasing.       

2.3.6  Voluntary  Initiatives  
Strict  voluntary  initiatives  that  focus  on  raising  consumer  awareness,  thereby  creating  greater  demand   for  eco  fashion  could  have  greater  potential  to  lead  to  reform  within  the  fashion  industry.  To  do  so,  it   appears   that   voluntary   initiatives   should   include   clear   labeling   of   `eco'   products   and   designer   input,   combined   with   strict   guidelines   for   company   and   designer   standards.   Voluntary   initiatives   and  

  

29  

awareness   campaigns   by   non-governmental   organizations   (NGOs)   may   be   used   to   generate   influence   beyond  the  direct  parties  involved  in  order  to  influence  both  producers  and  consumers  (Webb,  2004).   Literature   demonstrates   that   retailers   can   lead   in   voluntary   initiatives   and   be   positioned   in   a   way   to   advocate   on   behalf   of   consumers   and   anticipate   future   demands   or   trends   (Webb,   2004).   As   such,   retailers   have   the   unique   ability   to   implement   or   demand   producers   uphold   voluntary   codes   and   thus   may   act   as   `proxies'   for   consumers   while   anticipating   future   trends.      It   remains   imperative   that   NGOs   and  retailers  work  together  in  order  to  create  credibility  for  industry  standards  and  codes  (Webb,  2004).      The  global  context  of  the  fashion  industry  makes  regulating  and  monitoring   difficult,  as  a  single  garment   will   most   often   traverse   multiple   jurisdictions   before   entering   a   retail   store.   The   fast   fashion   industry   allows   for   accessible   and   affordable   clothing,   but   often   at   the   cost   of   the   environment   and   social   standards.  While,  eco-conscious  behaviour  is  on  the  rise,  there  appears  to  remain  a  lack  of  mainstream   awareness  regarding  the  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  fashion  industry  (Allwood  et   al.   2006).   Consumers,   retailers,   suppliers   and   designers   alike   lack   the   proper   tools   and   awareness   to   generate   informed   decisions   on   purchasing   decisions.   Information   on   `sustainable'   purchasing   for   the   fashion   industry   remains   fragmented.      Therefore,   it   appears   to   be   imperative   that   designers   play   an   active  role  in  the  development  of  voluntary  initiatives  (Salerno-Kochan,  2008).      Webb   (1999)   articulates   that   voluntary   initiatives   can   indeed   have   significant   legal   implications   in   the   private  sector,  and  can  prove  to  work  as  a  supplement  to  the  regulatory  system.  Voluntary  initiatives,   which   garnered   popularity   in   the   1990s,   are   consent-based   reform   whereby   companies,   on   their   own   accord,  sign  on  to  adhere  to  certain  industry  criteria  and  standards  in  exchange  for  benefits.    Benefits   can  include  greater  consumer  confidence  as  the  company  demonstrates  good  corporate  citizenship  or   corporate   social   responsibility.      When   working   in   conjunction   with   strict,   command   and   control   regulation,  voluntary  initiatives  can  provide  evidence,  in  the  form  of  due  diligence,  for  companies  should   they   be   charged   with   an   environmental   negligence.   Adhering   to   voluntary   initiatives   may   also   involve   less  frequent  inspections  if  a  company  is  seen  to  abide  by  an  accepted  program  (Webb,  1999).      In   the   Canadian   context,   policy   goals   of   voluntary   initiatives   include   the   protection   of   consumers   and   consumer  safety.  Webb's  (2004)  arguments  support  the  case  that  voluntary  initiatives  can  also  include   the  protection  of  the  environment  through  sustainable  practices  balanced  with  the  economic  viability  of   a   sustainable   fashion   industry   within   the   Canadian   context.   However,   specific   criteria   to   evaluate   and  

  

30  

assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  policy  goals  for  the  fashion  industry  are  needed.  Specific  criteria  should   include  increased  consumer  awareness,  clear  labeling,  and  designer  and  consumer  input  in  the  creation   of  sustainable  fashion  initiatives.      Voluntary   initiatives,   such   as   Fair   trade,   play   a   key   role   in   a   policy   framework   as   they   can   function   to   strengthen  state-based  regulation.  Due  to  the  multi-jurisdictional  aspect  of  the  fashion  industry,  state- based  regulation  can  be  difficult  to  uphold  and  monitor  throughout  the  entire  supply  chain.  If  volulntary   initiatives   include   a   requirement   for   greater   transparency,   designers   and   retailers   are   in   a   position   to   demonstrate   that   the   garments   they   sell   and   manufacture   comply   with   stipulated   environmental   criteria.   A   label   like   Fair   trade   has   widespread   recognition   among   consumers,   retailers   and   producers   allowing  for  greater  trust  in  the  label.           Voluntary   initiatives   can   establish   a   systematic   approach   to   structuring   environmental,   social   and   economic   impacts   of   a   product.   Over   the   past   two   decades,   voluntary   initiatives   have   become   very   important  in  the  food  and  forestry  industry  through  organic  and  fair  trade  certifications  and  the  creation   of   FSC.   However,   voluntary   initiatives   have   been   more   difficult   to   implement   for   textiles   and   artisanal   products  due  to  the  multi-jurisdictional  aspect  of  the  fashion  industry  as  most  garments  are  created  in   many  different  countries.  Most  voluntary  initiatives  address  only  one  part  of  the  fashion  supply  chain.    A   number  of  voluntary  initiatives  and  labels  exist  specifically  for  the  fashion  industry  including  the  Better   Cotton   Initiative   (BCI),   the   Sustainable   Apparel   Coalition,   MADE   BY,   Water<less,   Organic,   Eco   Label,   Cradle   to   Cradle   Certification   and   NICE.   Depending   who   you   ask   there   are   over   300   eco   labels   for   the   fashion   industry.   Despite   this,   there   is   an   inconsistency   among   measurement,   criteria   and   word   usage   used  to  identify  sustainable  fashion.  The  amount  of  VIs  can  lead  to  audit  fatigue  for  retailers  and  does   not  create  trust  among  consumers  (Gam,  2007).  Chapter  5  will  further  address  existing  VIs  in  the  fashion   industry   and   highlight   lessons   the   sustainable   fashion   industry   can   apply   from   the   fair   trade   coffee   industry.       

2.3.7  Certification  and  Labels:    
Certification   schemes   are   often   an   attempt   to   help   create   a   more   equitable   or   environmentally   responsible   response   for   industries.   In   the   case   of   fashion,   an   industry   that   transcends   borders   and   industries,   regulation   is   difficult   to   implement,   monitor   and   uphold.   Therefore,   voluntary   initiatives,

which  can  include  certification,  can  offer  a  way  for  industry  leaders  and  small  retailers  to  perform  due   diligence   and   demonstrate   to   their   consumers   that   they   are   working   towards   improving   industry   standards.    The  prevalence  of  certifications  and  labels  has  risen  due  to  regulation  in  response  to  failed   interventionist  states  to  meet  demand  made  by  a  globalized  system  (Garcia-Johnson  &  Sasser,  2001).        Consumers   rely   on   information   given   to   them   by   certifications   and   labels   to   assist   them   in   making   decisions   about   the   quality   of   intangible   elements   that   they   cannot   verify   for   themselves,   like   environment  and  equity  (Meyers,  2001).   These  certifications   provide  distinctive  quality  signs  to  create   consumer   recognition   and   market   valorization.   In   essence   these   certifications   and   labels,   such   as   Fair   Trade,   synthesize   information,   which   allows   consumers   to   reduce   the   time   allocated   to   researching   products  (Renard,  2005).  Labels  create  the  distinction  for  the  consumer.  Therefore,  represent  power  in   the   market.   In   order   for   a   label   to   be   successful   it   must   gain   consumer   confidence   in   the   truth   it   promotes   (Renard,   2005).      Certification   schemes   like   Fair   Trade   use   quality   as   symbolized   by   labels   to   form   the   basis   of   consumer   recognition   and   market   valorization.   Labels   must   act   on   both   sides   as   a   sign   of  validation  for  consumers  and  an  insurance  of  quality  on  the  market  side.        To   create   a   successful   certification   scheme,   signs   must   be   clear,   intelligible,   and   believable   and   carry   unequivocal  significance  shared  between  all  actors  that  integrate  the  supply  chain  (Renard,  2005).  In  the   case  of  Fair  trade  coffee  these  actors  include  small  producers  and  plantation  workers,  large  landowners,   processors,  producers,  brokers,  importers,  roaster-distributers,  retailers  and  consumers  (Waridel,  2002).     Certifications   require   norms   and   standards   to   define   their   legitimacy   and   strict   guidelines   to   control   the   use  of  the  certification  (Renard,  2005).          Labels   require   a   public   or   private   regulatory   organization   that   generates   legitimate   criteria   to   guarantee   products   comply   with   the   characteristics   outlined.   The   Fair   Trade   Labeling   Organization   International   (FLO)  provides  regulatory  criteria  for  the  Fair  Trade  certification.  The  FLO  functions  to  create  the  control   mechanisms   to   establish   barriers   to   enter   the   market   niche   of   Fair   trade   and   creates   economic   cooperation  between  actors  around  quality  (Bernard,  2005).        In   order   to   garner   greater   awareness   for   sustainable   fashion,   it   appears  that   voluntary   initiatives   should   include   clear   labeling   of   `eco'   products   and   designer   input,   combined   with   strict   guidelines   for   company   and   designer   standards.   Voluntary   initiatives   and   awareness   campaigns   by   NGOs   may   be   used   to

generate   influence   beyond   the   direct   parties   involved   in   order   to   influence   both   producers   and   consumers  (Webb,  2004).  Scholars  have  noted  environmental  and  social  ,  thereby  acting  as  "proxies"  for   environmentally   and   socially   conscious   consumers   This   "consumer   proxy"   capability   of   retailerscan   be   useful   in   driving   environmental   and   social   change   throughout   the   supply   chain,   working   with   other   actors   such   as   NGOs.   The   role   of   retailers   as   proxies   is   explored   in   greater   detail   in   Chapter   Six.The   global   context   of   the   fast   fashion   industry   makes   regulating   and   monitoring   difficult.   On   a   large   scale   there   still   exists   a   lack   of   understanding   and   consensus   on   what   sustainable   fashion   really   is.   Without   clear   messaging   from   the   fashion   industry,   consumers   are   left   struggling   to   understand   the   complexities   of   sustainable   fashion.   Therefore,   it   appears   to   be   imperative   that   retailers   play   an   active   role   in   the   development  of  voluntary  initiatives  (Salerno-Kochan,  2008).        

2.3.8  Fair  Trade  Coffee:  
Fair   trade   functions   as   a   critique   to   conventional   trade   practices   rooted   in   a   history   of   inequalities.   It   offers  an  effort  to  create  more  equitable  commodity  networks  that  link  consumers  in  the  Global  North   with   marginalized   producers   in   the   Global   South.   The   Fair   Trade   model,   and   other   fair   trade   type   certification   models,   offers   consumers   in   the   North   options   that   demonstrate   greater   emphasis   on   sustainable  and  ethical  production  methods  and  emphasize  responsible  consumption  through  advocacy   campaigns.  In  the  Global  South,  Fair  trade  seeks  to  offer  producers  better  prices,  market  access,  more   stable  market  links  and  resources  for  sustainable  and  ethical  projects  (Raynolds,  2008).          The   Fair   trade   Labeling   Organization   (FLO)   is   responsible   for   certifying   many   agricultural   products   and   artisanal   goods   including   coffee   and   cotton.   Based   in   Bonn,   Germany,   FLO   first   functioned   as   an   umbrella   group   to   20   labeling   initiatives   in   21   countries.   Coffee   is   the   world's   second   most   valuable   traded  commodity,  second  only  to  oil  with  an  estimated  2  billion  cups  sold  each  day  (Raynolds,  2008).        Fair   trade,   concerned   with   the   conditions   of   production   in   the   formal   sector   of   mainstreamed   commercial   companies,   focuses   on   the   conditions   of   specific   groups   of   producers.   Fair   Trade   looks   at   cooperatives  of  small  producers  or  plantations  that  meet  the  registration  criteria.  Fair  Trade  helps  these   cooperatives  gain  market  access  and  promises  a  minimum  price  guarantee.  It  seeks  to  build  a  network   of  exchange  and  to  establish  a  relationship  between  consumers  in  the  North  and  producers  in  the  South

that   transcends   conventional   commercial   transaction   by   providing   producers   with   tools   of   empowerment  (Taylor,  2004).          Similar  to  the  sustainable  fashion  movement,  no  singular  definition  of  fair  trade  coffee  exists;  however,   each  fair  trade  type  of  certification  seeks  to  address  environmental  and  ethical  issues  across  the  supply   chain   and   involves   a   form   of   third   party   monitoring   to   assure   conformity   to   consumers.   Each   type   of   initiative  comes  with  a  consumer-facing  label.  Research  will  highlight  the  fair  trade  movement  through   addressing  the  following  initiatives:  Fair  Trade  International  (FLO),  Fair  Trade  USA,  UTZ,  4C  Association,   Starbuck's  Fairly  Traded  Coffee  and  Rainforest  Alliance  with  specific  focus  on  the  FLO  and  Fair  Trade  USA   standards.     

2.3.8.1  History  of  Fair  Trade:  
Prior  to  Fair  Trade,  the  coffee  industry  was  subject  to  the  International  Coffee  Agreement  established  in   1962.   The   precursor   of   the   ICA   was   the   Inter-American   Coffee   Agreement   (IACA)   established   during   WWII.   With   coffee   prices   decreasing,   the   US   feared   that   Latin   American   countries   would   be   driven   towards   Nazi   or   Communist   sympathies.   In   1940   the   US   restricted   their   import   quotas   and   Latin   American   countries   restricted   their   production.   The   restrictions   allowed   coffee   prices   to   increase   to   nearly   double   in   1941   (over   1940).   The   International   Coffee   Agreement   (ICA)   is   an   international   commodity   agreement   between   coffee   producing   countries   and   coffee   consuming   countries.   The   aim   of   the  ICA  was  to  create  and  maintain  quotas  for  the  export  of  coffee  to  keep  coffee  prices  stable  and  high   in  the  market.  The  ICA  represents  all  producing  countries  and  most  consuming  countries.  As  of  2014,  the   ICA   has   45   members   consisting   of   39   exporting   members   and   6   importing   nations   and   1   importing   community  (the  EU  represents  all  states  as  one  member).      The  agreement  set  limits  on  trade  of  coffee  to  avoid  excess  supply  and  a  drop  in  price.  This  agreement   was   set   up   to   establish   a   way   to   protect   farmers   and   producers.   In   1976   the   agreement   was   renegotiated  and  price  quotas  were  suspended.  In  1983  the  agreement  was  once  again  redrawn  but  this   time   with   more   strict   import   and   export   regulations.   In   1989   the   1983   agreement   was   extended   but   without  quotas  because  they  could  not  be  determined.  From  1990  to  1992  the  coffee  industry  fell  into  a   crisis.  With  no  quotas  in  place  coffee  prices  fell  to  an  all-time  low.  The  market  was  flooded  with  coffee  at   low  cost  with  supply  exceeding  demand.  Fair  Trade  Certification  set  to  artificially  increase  coffee  prices   to  ensure  profit  to  growers.

   In   the   1940s   and   1950s,   NGOs   and   religious   organizations,   such   as   Ten   Thousand   Villages,   sought   to   create   more   equitable   supply   chains   for   producers.   This   movement   was   first   geared   towards   the   creators   of   handicrafts.   In   the   1960s,   as   the   International   Coffee   Agreement   was   established,   the   fair   trade   movement   began   to   take   shape.   With   its   development   came   the   criticism   that   industrialized   countries   and   multinational   corporations   were   simply   looking   for   another   way   to   use   their   power   for   further  enrichment  to  the  detriment  of  poor  countries  and  producers.      As   the   movement   and   needs   continues   to   grow,   fair   trade   attempts   to   address   some   key   problems   in   the   global   marketplace   by   addressing   the   producers',   consumers,   shareholders   and   retailers   by   representing   a   new   way   to   do   business.   Fair   Trade   highlights   inequalities   across   the   supply   chain   by   providing  a  holistic  view  to  address  market  failures  at  their  source,  while  still  understanding  the  need  for   profitability.      Consumers   are   beginning   to   demand   greater   transparency   and   increased   fairness   throughout   the   supply   chain.   Large   corporations   are   beginning   to   take   note,   and   Corporate   Social   Responsibility  (CSR)  has  raised  a  boardroom  level  topic  for  discussion  to  address  the  consumer  demands   (Nicholls  &  Opal,  2005).        Fair  trade   originated   as   a   response   to   poverty   post   WWII.   Flooded   coffee   markets   with   prices   at  all-time   low   due   to   lack   of   quotas   led   to   Fair   Trade   Coffee   movement.   Certification   aimed   to   artificially   raise   coffee  prices  to  ensure  profit  to  growers.  Certification  was  introduced  in  1988  and  was  launched  in  the   Netherlands   and   throughout   Europe.   It   wasn't   until   1997   that   the   Fair   Trade   Labeling   Organization   International   (FLO)   was   formed   as   the   combination   of   the   Fair   Trade   Foundation,   TransFair   USA   and   Tattvisemarkt.      Fair   Trade   emerged   in   the   postwar   period   with   two   distinct   streams;   liberal   development   groups   and   religious   charities   such   as   Oxfam   in   the   US   and   SERV   in   the   UK,   focusing   on   creating   markets   for   handicrafts   made   by   impoverished   people   though   networks   and   `world   shops'.   The   other   made   up   of   more   radical   solidarity   activists   and   NGOs   mobilized   around   supporting   grassroots   movements   in   the   third  world  (Renard  1999).  Slowly  the  two  sides  came  together  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  but  it  was  not   until  the  1980s  that  the  current  form  of  Fair  Trade  began  to  emerge.  In  1989  the  ICA  collapsed,  in  part   due  to  US  commercial  and  foreign  policy  and  coffee  prices  plummeted.

In   1988   Solidaridad,   a   Dutch   NGO,   partnered   with   UCIRI   Indigenous   coffee   cooperative   in   Uaxaca,   Mexico   with   the   goal   to   create   a   larger   market   for   UCIRI   coffee.   Solidaridad   created   the   label   Max   Havelaar,   a   label   that   could   be   applied   to   any   brand   that   upheld   their   standards   of   fairness   (Jaffee,   2012).  These  standards  included  fair  wages  for  smallholders,  repayment  or  credit  advanced  to  farmers   before  harvest,  additional  premium  paid  to  be  used  for  community  development  projects,  and  long  term   trading   arrangements   with   democratic   producer   cooperatives   and   associations.      The   Max   Havelaar   label   was  soon  used  by  other  alternative  trade  organizations  and  small  roasters  expanding  beyond  coffee  to   include  other  export  crops  such  as  cotton,  bananas  and  tea  (Jaeffee,  2012).        The  structure  was  fairly  simple:  national  licensing  initiatives  in  each  consumer  country  certified   producer  organizations  to  sell  fair  trade  products,  and  licensed  firms  that  met  fair  trade  criteria   to  use  the  seal  on  the  products  they  purchased  from  those  organized  farmers  (Jaeffee,  2012,  p.   103).      In  1997,  following  the  success  of  the  Max  Havelaar  label,  the  FLO  formed  in  Bonn,  Germany  as  a  result  of   the   rapidly   growing   European   licensing   initiatives.   The   following   year   TransFair   USA   was   created.   Originally   independent   of   FLO   and   housed   at   the   Institute   for   Agriculture   and   Trade   Police,   a   Minneapolis   Think   Tank,   TransFair   USA   became   independent   and   in   1999   joined   the   FLO   to   adopt   the   mainstreaming  strategy  aimed  to  increase  fair  trade  sales  through  conventional  retail  methods.        In  2010,  TransFair  USA  changed  to  Fair  Trade  USA  and  FLO  to  Fair  Trade  International.  Fair  Trade  USA   and   Fair   Trade   International   differed   over   their   criteria,   with   FLO   requiring   membership   and   representation   from   trade   unions   and   development   NGOs.   A   point   of   serious   contention   rose   when   Fair   Trade  USA  began  to  license  to  companies  in  the  US  to  sell  Fair  Trade  products,  most  notably  Starbucks   (Jaffee,  2012).        While   no   universal   definition   of   Fair   Trade   exists   (similar   to   no   universal   definition   of   sustainable   fashion),  there  exists  a  common  consensus  that  Fair  Trade  is  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  interest  and  rights  of   the  producer.  Both  FLO  (Fair  Trade  Labeling  Organization  International)  and  Fair  Trade  USA  agree  that   their   mission   is   to   "use   a   market-based   approach   that   empowers   farmers   to   get   a   fair   price   for   their   harvest,   helps   workers   create   safe   working   conditions,   provides   a   decent   living   wage,   and   guarantees   the  right  to  organize"  (TransFairUSA,  2014).

It   is   important   to   note   that   fair   trade   is   not   the   only   mechanism   used   to   help   regulate   the   coffee   industry.  Fair  trade  functions  as  one  of  many  tools  to  provide  market  access  for  small  producers  in  the   Global  South.  Fair  trade  functions  on  a  larger  scale  having  attracted  large  corporate  partners  at  the  retail   end.   Smaller   scale   programs   and   tools,   such   as   Direct   Trade,   can   be   efficient,   but   have   yet   to   be   integrated  in  a  large  and  systemic  way.

   Fair   trade   coffee   was   sold   in   the   US   beginning   in   1998.   Fair   trade   originated   as   a   response   to   poverty   post  WWII,  launched  in  the  Netherlands  and  as  a  social  movement  that  gained  momentum,  Fair  Trade   officially   became   a   certification   in   1988.   The   purpose   of   the   Fair   Trade   movement   is   to   empower   producers   through   fairer   trade,   which   can   lead   to   improvement   in   workers   social   and   economic   well- being  and  towards  greater  environmental  sustainability.  Fair  Trade  has  become  one  of  the  most  widely   recognized  certifications  on  the  market.  It  is  the  most  widely  recognized  certification  mark  in  the  UK,  6   out   of   10   consumers   have   seen   the   label   and   of   those,   89%   claim   they   trust   the   FAIRTRADE   mark   (fairtrade.org,  2014).        In  2012  there  were  1149  fair  trade  producer  organizations  worldwide  with  over  1.3  million  farmers  and   workers   in   70   countries,   a   16%   increase   over   2011   (FLO,   2013).   Producers   hold   50%   of   the   decision   making  power  in  fair  trade  and  an  estimated  80  million  in  Fair  Trade  premiums  was  paid  to  producers   in  2012  (FLO,  2013).    In  2012,  Fair  Trade  America  joined  the  FLO  standard  signing  on  major  companies   who   now   use   the   international   trademark   including   Ben   &   Jerry's,   Divine   Chocolate   and   Wholesome   Sweeteners  (FLO,  2013).    Coffee  was  one  of  the  first  products  to  carry  the  certification  in  1988  in  Europe   with  production  and  consumption  of  Fair  trade  coffee  growing  each  year  (Jaeffee,  2012).        Fair   trade   coffee   has   been   chosen   for   the   comparison   in   this   paper,   as   it   was   the   first   fair   trade   commodity.   The   system   has   grown   to   include   teas,   sugar,   bananas   and   flowers   among   others.   However,   coffee   remains   the   most   prevalent   in   sales   and   volume   (Jaeffee,   2012,   p.   95).      The   mainstreamed   fair   trade  movement  is  the  combination  of  a  coalition  of  activists,  retailers,  traders,  producer  organizations,   conscious  consumers,  NGOs,  and  certifiers  in  over  70  countries.  What  began  as  a  movement  functioning   outside   of   the   capitalist   model   with   a   commitment   to   guarantee   minimum   price   to   producers   to   improve  the  livelihoods  of  farmers  and  artisans,  now  functions  within  the  capitalist  model  attempting  to

create  more  equitable  capitalist  structures  for  small  farmers  (Jaffee,  2012).    Fair  trade  provides  an  all- encompassing  voluntary  initiative,  addressing  both  social  and  environmental  standards.  As  a  consumer- facing  label  it  has  led  in  part  to  a  greater  awareness  among  consumers  on  the  benefits  of  fair  trade  type   certifications.   Both   large   and   small   retailers   played   a   large   part   in   the   success   of   the   movement,   playing   a   significant   role   as   proxy   for   consumers   in   the   rising   popularity   of   fair   trade   coffee.   Smaller   retailers   were  at  the  forefront  of  the  fair  trade  coffee  movement,  with  larger  retailers  like  Starbucks  entering  the   fair  trade  market  in  2000  (Jaffee,  2012).             According  to  Fairtrade.org,  fair  trade  sales  continue  to  grow  each  year.  Excluding  the  USA,  average  sales   of  fair  trade  goods  increased  by  over  20%  from  2011  to  2012.  In  addition,  consumers  spent  4.8  billion   euros   on   Fair   Trade   products   in   2012.   Large   retailers   Nespresso,   Ben   &   Jerry's   and   Maltesers   in   addition   to  Nestle  made  major  new  commitments  to  fair  trade  in  2012.  New  countries,  importers  and  distributers   continue  to  become  incorporated  into  the  initiative.  In  addition,  the  sale  of  fair  trade  products  has  now   begun  to  transcend  to  the  Global  South  as  they  became  available  for  purchase  in  both  India  and  Kenya   in  2012.        In  response  to  the  rapidly  growing  market  of  fair  trade  goods,  addressing  fair  trade  issues  is  now  a  part   of   the   agenda   for   most   major   retailers   in   Europe,   including   Monoprix,   Tesco,   Migros   and   Carrefour   (Nicholls   &   Opal,   2004).   Fair   Trade   is   now   the   subject   of   hundreds   of   global   media   stories   each   year   and   is   now   taught   as   a   formal   part   of   academic   disciplines   including,   business   ethics,   marketing,   business   development,   buying   and   retail   operations   and   international   development   (Nicholls   &   Opal,   2004).     Large  organizations  like  the  United  Nations  are  beginning  to  take  note  of  Fair  Trade  and  recognize  the   model   as   a   new   model   of   trade   as   development   agencies   seek   to   move   away   from   aid   work   towards   trade  (Nicholls  &  Opal,  2004).        In  Canada,  municipalities  are  beginning  to  take  note  of  the  importance  of  Fair  trade  by  adopting  the  idea   of  the  `Fair  Trade  Town'  first  used  in  England  in  1999.  The  Fair  trade  Town  promotes  Fair  trade  as  part  of   community  effort  through  local  business,  town  council  and  private  citizen  interest  (Fairtrade.ca).  In  2007   Wolfville,  Nova  Scotia  became  Canada's  first  Fair  trade  Town.  Since  1999,  18  other  towns  have  earned   that   designation   including   Toronto,   Vancouver   and   Edmonton   and   an   additional   23   towns   have   active   campaigns   in   the   works   (Fairtrade.ca).      There   are   now   more   than   1,300   Fair   Trade   towns   in   over   20   countries  with  consumers  spending  4.8  billion  on  Fair  Trade  products  in  2012  (FLO,  2013).

2.3.9  Conclusion  
Literature   demonstrates   that   there   are   considerable   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   felt   throughout  the  fashion  supply  chain,  in  the  production  of  textiles,  the  manufacturing  of  garments  and  in   the   consumer   and   disposal   phase.   Literature   clearly   illustrates   that   the   fashion   model   is   the   latest   manifestation   of   the   fashion   industry   and   is   further   increasing   the   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.   Sustainable   fashion   is   an   emerging   industry   and   academic   field.   While   just   an   emerging   academic  field,  researchers  and  environmentalists  are  now  placing  more  emphasis  on  investigating  the   entire   lifecycle   of   garments   and   addressing   areas   of   concern   (Kozlowski,   Bardecki   &   Searcy,   2012).   In   contradiction   to   the   fast   fashion   industry,   sustainable   fashion   is   gaining   in   popularity   and   shows   signs   of   being  more  than  a  passing  fashion  trend.  While  there  exists  no  law  so  far  that  has  been  able  to  address   the   negative   impacts   associated   with   fashion,   there   are   growing   numbers   of   voluntary   initiatives   that   address   the   specific   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   of   fashion.   Literature   demonstrates   that   some  major  brands  and  retailers  are  now  implementing  corporate  social  responsibility  standards  (CSR)   throughout  their  supply  chains,  with  a  heavy  emphasis  on  environmental  sustainability.    Chapter  4  will   highlight  five  leading  sustainable  retailers  and  their  environmental  commitments  and  targets.        While  there  exist  many  VI  used  throughout  the  fashion  industry,  there  has  yet  to  be  one  comprehensive   initiative   and/or   labeling   scheme   that   addresses   the   entire   lifecycle   of   a   garment   and   generates   consumer  confidence.    This  lack  of  a  cohesive  VI  makes  it  difficult  for  consumers  to  find  confidence  in   sustainability   claims   of   brands.   Fair   trade   type   certification   schemes   used   in   the   coffee   industry   have   provided  this  `all  in  one'  cohesive  type  certification  and  offer  a  pivotal  point  for  consumers,  producers   and   retailers   alike   to   address   both   the   environmental   and   social   concerns   of   the   coffee   industry.      Fair   trade   has   become   accepted   as   `mainstreamed'   in   the   consumer   marketplace,   with   consumers   and   retailers  alike  purchasing  fair  trade  alternatives  over  others.  Fair  trade  type  certification  schemes  can  aid   in  providing  a  framework  to  develop  strategies  to  further  address  environmental  issues  created  by  the   fast   fashion   industry.   Literature   demonstrates   the   role   retailers   can   play   as   proxies   for   consumers,   by   doing   the   research   for   consumers   and   acting   on   behalf   of   environmentally   and   socially   responsible   consumers.  Chapter  5  will  draw  lessons  from  fair  trade  type  coffee  certification  for  the  fashion  industry   and   Chapter   6   will   build   a   business   case   for   sustainable   fashion   by   highlighting   leading   sustainable   designers  and  retailers.

Chapter  3  Methodology  
3.1  Introduction  
Research   methods   will   include   a   mixed   method   approach.   Developed   in   1959,   the   mixed-method   approach   has   been   used   by   researchers   to   collect   and   analyses   both   quantitative   and   qualitative   data   (Creswell,  2003).  Research  objectives  are  to  determine  trends  in  sustainable  reporting  of  major  fashion   retailers,  identify  substantive  developments  in  sustainable  fashion,  the  emerging  challenges  and  issues   impacting   sustainability,   outline   the   role   retailers   and   voluntary   initiatives   can   play   in   addressing   sustainability,   and   to   draw   lessons   from   the   fair   trade   coffee   movement   that   the   fashion   industry   can   adopt.   This   research   will   employ   both   quantitative   and   qualitative   methodologies   to   address   research   objectives  of  assessing  the  feasibility  of  incorporating  sustainability  standards  into  the  fashion  industry   by  creating  a  business  case  for  sustainability.  Research  will  encompass  a  variety  of  social  science  tools   including   report   and   document   analysis,   word   content   analysis,   comparative   analysis   and   lesson   drawing.        Methodology   one,   the   literature   review   in   chapter   2   illustrated   the   environmental   impacts   created   by   the   fashion   industry   and   the   growing   awareness   of   these   impacts.  Methodology   two,   content   analysis   using   Nvivo   software,   will   highlight   the   latest   trends   in   sustainability   reporting   in   the   fashion   sector   through   word   content   analysis.   Through   word   content   analysis,   research   aims   to   determine   what   sustainable  practices  retailers  are  reporting  on  and  to  track  trends,  if  any,  through  reporting  practices  by   major   retailers.   Methodology   three,   lesson   drawing,   (discussed   further   below)   aims   to   fair   trade   type   certification   schemes   for   lessons   that   can   be   applied   to   the   sustainable   fashion   market.      Research   is   looking  to  find  parallels  between  fair  trade  type  certification  for  coffee  and  sustainable  certification  for   fashion,   particularly   focusing   on   cotton.   Methodology   four,   engages   in   a   critical   analysis   of   current   organizations,   initiatives,   retailers   and   designers   engaging   with   and   promoting   sustainable   fashion   to   demonstrate   the   growing   business   case   for   sustainability.   Research   will   highlight   the   key   role   retailers   can   play   in   addressing   sustainability   issues   by   highlighting   key   retailers   that   have   made   their   sustainability   part   of   their   core   business   practices.      Figure   3   highlights   the   details   pertaining   to   each   stage  of  methodology,  which  will  be  explained  in  the  following  sections.

3.2  Planning  Stage  
3.2.1  Identifying  Brands  
Given   the   research's   focus   on   sustainable   fashion   brands,   the   sample   retail   population   draws   on   the   largest   retailers   in   the   fast   fashion   and   coffee   industry   leading   in   sustainability   practices   between   the   reporting   periods   of   2009-2013.   As   units   of   analysis,   the   research   first   sought   to   identify   these   key   retailers  in  both  the  fashion  and  coffee  industry.        The   sample   population   of   fashion   and   coffee   retail   brands   was   pulled   from   Maclean's   top   50   Socially   Responsible  Companies  in  Canada:  2014  list,  a  leading  industry  report.    The  report  highlighted  five  (5)   leading   fashion   retail   firms   and   two   (2)   leading   coffee   retail   brands   on   the   basis   of   their   performance   across  a  wide  range  of  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  indicators  tracked  by  Sustainalytics.   The   fashion   firms   include   Adidas,   Gildan,   H&M,   Inditex   and   Nike   used   as   units   of   analysis   to   compare   each  firm's  CSR  strategy.  Each  company  demonstrated  strong  public  disclosure  and  performance  in  the   areas   of   environmental   initiatives,   supply   chain   management   and   impact   on   local   communities.     Sustainalytics'  research  approach  compares  companies  within  a  given  peer  group  and  includes  thorough

3.2.2  Identifying  Key  Words    
Once  the  fashion  and  coffee  retail  brands  were  identified,  their  annual  Corporate  Social  Responsibility   (CSR)   reports,   available   through   their   websites,   from   2009-2013   were   collected.   These   CSR   annual   reports   were   analyzed   to   track   sustainability   trends.      Trends   were   determined   by   identifying   key   sustainable  words  throughout  each  report.        Research   pulled   key   words   from   Sustainability   in   Retailing-a   Summative   Content   Analysis   (Wiese   et   al   2010),  a  research  paper  analyzing  past  and  current  sustainability  developments  focusing  on  the  role  of   retailers  in  supply  chains.    Weise  et  al  (2010)  used  a  summative  content  analysis  to  determine  research   objectives   in   scientific   literature   relevant   to   supply   chains,   with   a   specific   focus   on   sustainability   considerations  in  the  retail  sector.  Weise  et  al  (2010)  identify  retailers  as  playing  a  major  role  in  supply   chains   as   they   act   as   the   intermediary   between   consumer   and   producer.      Retailers   hold   significant

power  to  influence  and  engage  in  environmental  supply  chain  management.  Weise  et  al  (2010)  tracked   the  frequency  of  sustainability  considerations  in  scientific  literature  in  the  retail  sector  between  1981- 2010.   The   authors   thoroughly   analyzed   the   content   of   academic   research   papers   in   the   retail   sector   and   acknowledged  that  sustainable  retail  research  is  in  its  infancy  with  a  promising  path  in  its  future.  Weise   et   al   (2010)   discovered   that   as   academic   research   is   in   its   infancy   it   is   currently   impossible   to   make   general  statements  about  sustainability  issues  in  retail  (p.327).      Weise  et  al  (2010)  analyzed  only  peer   reviewed,  academic  literature,  and  a  thorough  examination  of  NGO  reports  and  retail  CSR  reports  will   help  provide  a  more  holistic  understanding  of  sustainability  in  the  retail  sector.      In   order   to   supplement   the   research   from   Weise   et   al   (2010)   research   pulled   words   from   the   State   of   Sustainability   Initiatives   (SSI)   2014   report.   Launched   in   2008,   SSI   releases   leading   industry   reviews   through  a  partnership  between  the  International  Institute  for  Environment   and  Development  (IIED)  and   Aidenvironment.   The   SSI   Review   is   an   independent   evidence-based   report   on   the   characteristics,   performance   and   market   trends   related   to   sustainability   initiatives.   The   SSI   Review   aims   to   provide   supply  chain  decision-makers-including  procurement  agents,  investment  advisors,  CEOs,  policy-makers,   sustainability  initiatives  and  NGOs-with  high-level  data  and  analysis  needed  to  navigate  the  increasingly   complex  field  of  sustainability  standards.      The   SSI   project   looks   to   enhance   the   global   understanding   about   the   role   of   market-based   voluntary   sustainability  standards,  (VSS)  including  labels  and  certifications,  to  promote  sustainable  development.   SSI  outlines  three  (3)  main  project  activities  to  achieve  review  objectives:      1) Documenting   the   market   trends   and   developments   of   the   VSS   sector   through   a   regular   series   of   "SSI  Reviews"   2) Providing  a  regular  reporting  service  on  major  VSS  events   3) Facilitating   thematic   discussions   on   the   relationship   between   VSS   and   key   sustainable   development  issues.   While   there   currently   exist   more   than   400   consumer-facing   eco   labels   across   the   globe,   the   SSI   2014   Review   analyzed   sixteen   (16)   of   the   most   important   standards   and   initiatives,   four   (4)   in   the   coffee   sector   and   two   (2)   in   the   cotton   sector.   These   sixteen   initiatives   currently   certify   or   verify   US$31.6   billion,  accounting  for  an  important  share  in  the  global  market  in  the  agriculture,  forestry  and  biofuels   sector   (SSI   Review   2014).      SSI   chose   initiatives   with   a   global   presence   that   are   operational   in   one   or   more   of   the   following   commodities:   bananas,   biofuels,   cocoa   coffee,   cotton,   forestry,   palm   oil,   soy,

sugar   or   tea.   Research   will   address      initiatives   targeting   supply   chains   in   the   coffee   and   the   cotton   sector.     

3.3  Data  Collection  Stage  
3.3.1  Qualitative  Content  Analysis  
Research   used   a   qualitative   content   analysis   as   the   scientific   tool   to   approach   research   objectives.   Qualitative   content   analysis   is   used   to   interpret   meaning   from   the   content   of   written   communication,   for   the   purpose   of   this   paper   content   is   interpreted   from   retailer   CSR   reports.   Qualitative   content   analysis  shows  three  approaches  to  interpret  data;  conventional,  directed  or  summative.  Research  uses   the   directed   approach,   starting   with   relevant   research   findings   to   guide   initial   codes.   Krippendorff   (1980)   identifies   the   following   six   questions   to   be   addressed   in   the   initial   process   of   conducting   qualitative  content  analysis;  Which  data  is  analyzed;   How  are  they  defined;  What  is  the  population  from   which   they   are   drawn;   What   is   the   context   relative   to   which   the   data   are   analyzed;   What   are   the   boundaries  of  analysis;  and  what  is  the  target  of  inferences?      1:  Which  Data  Are  Analyzed?   Research   analyses   CSR   reports   published   by   retail   fashion   and   coffee   brands.   To   ensure   consistency,   research   will   focus   on   reports   published   between   2009   and   2013.   To   adequately   answer   research   questions,  data  analysis  focuses  on  identifying  the  following  categories:        Market   Overview:      Research   assessed   the   overall   trends   throughout   each   CSR   report   as   they   relate   to   sustainability  and  voluntary  initiatives.  The  data  will  be  compared  against  overall  VI  trends  as  published   by  the  2014  SSI  review,  to  provide  a  holistic  overview  of  VSS  retailing  trends.          Corporate   Social   Responsibility   (CSR):   Definitions   of   CSR   across   the   fashion   and   coffee   sector,   mission   statements   and   reporting   measures   of   each   retailer   are   identified.   This   section   will   assess   the   corporate   culture  and  commitment  to  sustainability  within  the  fashion  retail  sector.      Leading  CSR  Goals:  Key  CSR  objectives  by  retailers,  their  goals  and  the  reason  they  have  been  chosen  are   highlighted.

Voluntary   Initiatives/Certification   Schemes:   Analysis   tracks   the   implementation   VIs   by   each   of   the   sample  retailers.     

2.  How  Are  They  Defined?    
Retailers   CSR   performance   is   analyzed   through   their   publically   available   online   CSR   reports   and   documents.  Analysis  focuses  on  CSR  reports  published  between  2010  and  2014  for  the  reporting  periods   of   2009,   2010,   2011,   2012   and   2013   to   provide   a   holistic   landscape   of   trends   as   they   have   developed   over  the  past  five  (5)  years.       

3.    What  Is  the  Population  From  Which  They  Are  Drawn?  
The   population   from   which   the   retailers   were   chosen   consists   of   retailers   with   significant   brand   presence  or  market  capitalization  in  Canada.  Retailers  were  chosen  from  Maclean's  2014  Top  50  Socially   Responsible  Companies.  The  sample  population  includes  both  fashion  and  coffee  retailers.      4.  What  is  the  Context  Relative  to  Which  the  Data  Are  Analyzed?   As  referenced  in  chapter  one,  the  research  objective  is  to  define  key  sustainability  trends  in  the  fashion   retail  industry  to  determine  the  feasibility  of  mainstreaming  a  VSS  across  the  fashion  industry.  The  goal   of  research  is  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  CSR  landscape  in  the  fashion  retailing  industry  to  highlight   the   role   retailers   and   voluntary   initiatives   can   play   in   addressing   sustainability   issues   in   the   fashion   industry   by   looking   to   lessons   learned   from   the   fair   trade   coffee   movement.   In   addition,   research   will   highlight   the   latest   developments   in   sustainability   in   the   fashion   sector   by   showcasing   the   progress   made  in  the  retail  sector.      5.  What  Are  the  Boundaries  of  the  Analysis?   Analysis  focuses  on  retailers  with  a  presence  in  the  Canadian  market.  Due  to  the  wide  range  of  fabrics   used   in   the   fashion   industry,   research   focuses   primarily   on   the   production   of   sustainable   cotton   and   initiatives  addressing  cotton  production.     A   second   boundary   is   that   each   retailer   needs   to   have   made   publically   available   their   commitment   to   CSR  objectives  between  the  2009  and  2013  reporting  periods.        6.  What  is  the  Target  of  Inferences?  

  

45  

Krippendorf   (1980)   defines   inference   as   a   deduction   or   conclusion   drawn   from   facts,   therefore,   target   inferences  in  the  given  research  framework  are  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  trends  analyzed  in  the   identified  data  sets.    The  primary  objective  of  this  research  was  to  define  key  sustainability  trends  in  the   fashion  retail  industry  to  determine  the  feasibility  of  mainstreaming  a  VSS  across  the  fashion  industry.   To   adequately   address   the   primary   objective,   four   (4)   sub-questions   were   identified   in   chapter   1   that   guided  the  development  of  data  collection  and  analysis.        Each   published   CSR   report   from   both   the   fashion   and   coffee   retail   brands   was   analyzed   using   NVivo   qualitative   research   software.   Research   highlighted   how   each   retailer   defined   sustainability,   tracked   trends  in  sustainability  reporting  and  highlighted  key  sustainability  words  in  CSR  reports  using  NVivo  to   find  commonalities  throughout  each  published  report.       

3.4  Lesson  Drawing:  Fair  trade  Coffee  and  Cotton  
Lesson   drawing   is   most   often   used   as   public   policy   tool,   often   part   of   a   contested   political   process.   Lesson   drawing   is   often   used   to   emulate   governmental   programs   that   worked   in   one   jurisdiction   in   another   jurisdiction.   Lesson   drawing   is   often   used   in   public   policy   literature   to   focus   on   public   policy   actors  who  look  to  another  jurisdiction  to  see  what  policies  may  be  adopted  in  their  jurisdiction.        While  lesson  drawing  is  often  a  public  policy  tool  used  in  politics,  this  research  will  use  it  as  a  starting   point  to  draw  lessons  that  the  fashion  industry  can  adopt  from  the  fair  trade  coffee  industry.    In  order  to   draw  lessons  and  conclusions,  research  will   use    the  fashion  industry  and  the  coffee  industry  as  units  of   analysis.   Research   will   look   at   the   strengths   and   the   weaknesses   of   the   fair   trade   movement   in   the   coffee   sector   to   see   how   these   lessons   can   be   applied   to   the   fashion   industry,   specifically   focusing   on   the  use  of  cotton.  Rose  (1991)  states  that  lesson  drawing  answers  the  following  question:  Under  what   circumstances  and  to  what  extent  can  a  program  that  is  effective  in  one  place  transfer  to  another?  The   process  must  begin  with  scanning  programs  that  are  effective  in  one  area  and  conclude  upon  evaluation   of   the   outcome   of   a   program   being   implemented   to   a   new   sector   in   the   future.   Rose   (1991)   defines   lesson-drawing   as   a   research   method   that   can   be   carried   out   by   searching   across   time   and/or   across   space.  Research  will  look  to  written  materials  on  and  history  of  fair  trade-type  certification  to  determine   if  the  fashion  industry  can  adopt  elements  of  fair  trade-type  certification.       

  

46  

Rose   (1991)   defines   the   following   as   the   steps   to   lesson-drawing.   Scanning   programs   elsewhere:   this   first   step   seeks   information   about   programs   by   public   agencies   that   have   addressed   similar   problems   allowing  the  researcher  to  gain  fresh  ideas  relevant  to  a  problem  that  is  not  adequately  being  handled   across  time  and/or  space.  For  the  purpose  of  this  research,  lesson  drawing  is  used  less  empirically  and   encompasses  insights  concerning  governance  by  both  public  sector  and  private  sector  actors  involved;   instead,  fair  trade  documents  will  be  analyzed  by  the  researcher.  The  researcher  will  draw  lessons  from   written   materials   as   to   what   can   be   recommended   by   private   sector   actors   to   in   the   future.   The   fast   fashion  industry  faces  the  problem  of  a  lack  of  consumer  engagement  and  awareness  of  environmental   and  social  impacts  of  manufacturing.  Coffee  faced  a  similar  problem,  with  the  introduction  of  fair  trade   type  certification  consumers  are  more  aware  and  conscious  of  their  coffee  purchases.  Research  chose  to   highlight   Fair   trade   as   the   working   program   to   draw   lessons   from.   The   fast   fashion   and   coffee   industries   share  many  similarities,  which  will  be  addressed  further  in  the  analysis  stage.      Creating  a  new  program:  Lesson  drawings  draws  on  empirical  evidence  from  one  program  to  adopt  for   another.    Rose  (1991,  p.  22)  defines  5  Alternative  Ways  of  Drawing  a  Lesson   1. Copying.   Adoption   more   or   less   intact   of   a   programme   already   in   effect   in   another   jurisdiction.   2. Emulation.   Adoption,   with   adjustment   for   different   circumstances,   of   a   programme   already  in  effect  in  another  jurisdiction.   3. Hybridization.  Combine  elements  of  programmes  from  two  different  places.   4. Synthesis.   Combine   familiar   elements   from   programmes   in   effect   in   three   or   more   different  places   5. Inspiration.  Programmes  elsewhere  used  as  intellectual  stimulus  for  developing  a  novel   programme  without  an  analogue  elsewhere.        Research  will  use  emulation  as  the  alternative  way  to  draw  lessons  from  the  fair  trade  coffee  sector  to   the   fashion   industry   focusing   on   the   production   of   cotton.      Rose   (1991)   states   that   emulation   accepts   that  a  program  elsewhere  provides  a  standard  for  designing  a  program  at  home.  Emulation  can  function   as  a  tool  to  generate  innovation  and  to  improve  upon  an  existing  model.  Research  looks  to  the  fair  trade   coffee  sector  to  adopt  some  best  practices,  taking  into  account  the  complexity  of  the  fashion  industry.

3.5  Building  a  Case  for  Sustainability:    
3.5.1  Role  of  Designers  and  Retailers  and  the  case  for  sustainable   fashion  
Research  chose  leaders  in  the  sustainable  fashion  retail  sector  to  highlight  key  initiatives  taking  place  in   the   sector.   A   small   selection   of   designers   and   retailers   with   integrated   sustainability   standards   were   chosen   to   highlight   the   growing   trend   among   retailers   and   designers,   highlighting   the   pivotal   role   designers   and   retailers   can   play   in   creating   a   more   sustainable   industry.   Research   will   highlight   the   specific   role   retailers   can   play   in   promoting   sustainable   fashion.   Vivienne   Westwood,   Levi's,   PUMA,   MEC,   Patagonia   and   Marks   and   Spencer   are   all   leading   global   brands   with   strong   sustainability   standards.       

3.6  Conclusion    
Through   a   mixed   method   approach   research   is   able   to   collect   both   quantitative   and   qualitative   analysis.   Methodology   one,   the   literature   review,   looks   to   illustrate   the   negative   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion  industry,  the  growing  awareness  of  the  impacts  and  the  increase  in  VIs  addressing  these  issues.   Methodology   two   uses   Nvivo   software   to   determine   key   trends   in   sustainability   reporting   throughout   the   fashion   industry   by   analyzing   the   CSR   reports   of   leading   retailers.   Methodology   two   looks   to   highlight  key  words  used  throughout  the  reports  and  to  track  similarities  (or  lack  thereof)  in  reporting   methods   used   throughout   the   industry,   identify   substantive   developments   in   sustainable   fashion   and   the   emerging   challenges   and   issues   impacting   sustainability.   Methodology   three,   lesson   drawing,   research  aims  to  draw  on  parallels  between  and  fair  trade  type  certified  coffee  and  sustainable  cotton   for  the  fashion  industry.     Research   is   looking  to   highlight   lessons   the   fashion   industry   can   learn   from   fair   trade  coffee  by  appealing  to  conscientious  consumers  with  the  guarantee  that  by  purchasing  sustainable   fashion   the   value   is   shared   throughout   the   supply   chain,   mitigating   environmental   damage   caused   by   manufacturing.   Methodology   four   highlights   the   key   role   retailers   can   play   in   addressing   sustainability   issues  by  featuring  key  retailers  that  have  made  their  sustainability  part  of  their  core  business  practices.

CSR   reporting   on   sustainability   targets   and   goals   is   becoming   more   pervasive   in   the   fashion   industry.   This   chapter   will   analyze   and   compare   the   CSR   reports   from   the   last   five   years   (2009-2013)   from   five   leading   fashion   retailers   in   the   fast   fashion   and   sports   apparel   sector.   As   there   does   not   yet   seem   to   exist  a  set  standard  for  reporting  on  targets  and  initiatives,  direct  comparison  is  often  difficult.    Retailers

report   this   as   a   difficulty,   along   with   a   lack   of   common   definitions   and   vocabulary   for   the   fashion   industry.  Retailers  cited  numerous  challenges  to  improving  overall  sustainability  throughout  the  supply   chain.   Challenges   and   barriers   include;   lack   of   common   standards,   continually   changing   information   regarding   materials,   lack   of   access   to   information   (for   designers),   and   insufficient   focus   on   materials   innovation  (NIKE  CSR,  2013).  NIKE  has  attempted  to  address  this  by  creating  their  Material  Sustainability   Index  and  has  been  working  with  the  Sustainable  Apparel  Coalition  to  help  improve  the  HIGG  index.  As   the   literature   review   demonstrated,   the   fashion   industry   generates   considerable   environmental   impacts   through   textile   production   and   process,   garment   manufacturing   and   consumer   consumption   and   disposal.   The   entire   lifecycle   of   the   retailers   supply   chains   are   addressed   and   their   CSR   reports   are   compared  below  based  on  the  following  four  categories;  Waste,  Water,  Energy  and  CO2.        Each   of   the   five   retailers,   Adidas,   Gildan,   H&M,   Inditex   and   NIKE   have   all   joined   various   voluntary   initiatives,  adhering  to  their  standards  and  goals.  These  initiatives  tackle  both  social  and  environmental   standards,  but  not  cohesively.    The  sample  set  of  retailers  have  identified  textile  production  as  creating   the  largest  environmental  impact  through  the  use  of  pesticides,  water  use  and  the  chemicals  used  in  the   dyeing  and  processing  phase.    Both  NIKE  and  Adidas  have  come  up  with  new  processes  to  dye  textiles   using   no   water   and   decreasing   the   chemical   and   energy   required   by   50%.      Retailers   also   cite   the   consumer   phase,   specifically   the   disposal,   as   an   area   of   concern.   H&M   has   implemented   take   back   programs   for   their   consumers   at   all   of   their   retail   locations;   acting   as   a   proxy   for   consumers   by   educating  consumers  on  the  recycling  of  clothing  and  by  providing  a  simple  option.        Retail  Sample  Set   Representing   the   five   (5)   most   sustainable   fashion   retailers   operating   in   Canada   (Maclean's   top   50   Socially   Responsible   Companies   in   Canada:   2014),   the   study's   chosen   sample   retail   set   covers   fast   fashion  specialty  retailers  and  sports  apparel  and  footwear  retailers.  Each  of  the  five  companies  releases   yearly   annual   reports   and   sustainability   reports   publicly   disclosing   corporate   targets   and   their   compliance  with  voluntary  environmental  and  social  standards  and  initiatives.    The  study's  data  is  based   on   this   publicly   available   data.   Table   2   below   lists   the   sample   retailers,   their   2013   sales   and   the   CSR   reports  analyzed  for  their  content  analysis.

*No   2013   comprehensive   report   for   Gildan   was   available.   The   2013   Report   was   broken   down   into   individual  sections  available  online.  Each  report  was  downloaded  and  converted  to  a  single  report  by  the   researcher  in  order  to  be  used  for  NVivo  content  analysis.      4.2  Sustainability  in  the  Fashion  Retail  Sector      Defining  Social  Responsibility  and  CSR   There  is  no  set  definition  for  social  responsibility  or  CSR  for  retailers.  CSR  in  the  retail  sector  commonly   addresses  both  social  and  environmental  targets;  however,  reporting  mechanisms  differ  from  one   retailer  to  the  next.  While  there  is  no  agreed  upon  universal  definition  for  CSR,  a  commonly  understood   definition  for  social  responsibility  is  outlined  by  the  ISO  26000  Working  Group  on  Social  Responsibility   (February  2007)  as  `Social  responsibility  (is  the)  responsibility  of  an  organization  for  the  impacts  of  its   decisions  and  activities  on  society  and  the  environment  through  transparent  and  ethical  behavior  that  is   consistent  with  sustainable  development  and  the  welfare  of  society;  it  takes  into  account  the   expectations  of  stakeholders;  is  in  compliance  with  applicable  law  and  consistent  with  international   norms  of  behavior;  and  is  integrated  throughout  the  organization'.        Increasingly,   CSR   activities   are   being   understood   by   private   businesses   across   all   sectors,   not   just   fashion.   Recognition   of   the   effect   business   activities   have   on   employees,   communities,   consumers,   shareholders  and  the  environment  is  growing.  Private  firms  are  beginning  to  see  the  link  between  good   business   practices   and   good   business   (IISD,   2007).   In   addition,   investors   and   financial   markets   are   recognizing   that   CSR   activities   can   interact   directly   with   business   strategy   demonstrating   good   management   thus   providing   companies   with   a   competitive   edge.      In   NIKE's   2013   sustainability   report,

NIKE   reported   that   improving   environmental   standards,   including   reducing   waste   and   improving   efficiency,  could  improve  the  company's  competitiveness.        Despite   these   advances   in   understanding   the   link   between   responsible   business   practices   and   good   business,  there  still  remains  a  degree  of  confusion  and  controversy  surrounding  CSR.  Most  prominently   from   a   business   perspective,   is   the   implementation   of   CSR   practices   a   cost   or   a   value-enhancer   for   companies  (IISD,  2007)?  From  the  consumer  perspective,  is  a  CSR  strategy  just  public  relations  or  green   washing?  To  be  truly  transformational,  CSR  practices  must  be  integrated  directly  into  business  practices,   not  implemented  as  an  afterthought.        Businesses  are  integral  to  the  communities  they  serve,  and  good  executives  understand  that  long-term   success  is  based  on  strong  relationships  with  those  communities.  Increasingly  consumers  are  coming  to   expect  goods  that  are  both  socially  and  environmentally  conscious  (IISD,  2007).    In  addition,  through  the   advancement   of   technology,   access   to   information   and   social   media,   consumers   now   have   more   and   more  tools  to  hold  companies  responsible.      Sample  Set  Sustainability  Standards  and  Targets   Sustainability   and   corporate   social   responsibility   (CSR),   though   not   new   terms,   remain   contested   in   a   business   sense   and   especially   so   in   the   fashion   industry.      There   have   been   many   apparel   and   textile   studies  that  have  used  the  term  social  responsibility  or  CSR,  but  few  have  offered  a  definition,  and  there   has   yet   to   be   a   universally   accepted   specific   definition   for   either   term   (Dickson   &   Eckman,   2006).   In   a   broad   sense,   sustainability   and   CSR   in   the   fashion   sector   seems   to   encompass   the   triple   bottom   line;   people,  planet  and  profit.  It  remains  a  challenge  for  retailers  to  act  in  the  best  interest  of  society  and  the   environment   while   acting   in   the   best   interest   of   its   shareholders.   This   study   will   analyze   the   environmental   concerns   of   the   sample   set   of   five   retailers   addressed   through   their   respective   CSR   reports.          

CSR  Reporting  across  the  retail  sample  set  dates  back  as  early  as  1998  (Adidas).  Releasing  CSR  reports   with  commitments  towards  both  social  and  environmental  standards  is  now  the  norm  throughout  the   fashion   retail   sector.   Of   the   five   retailers   researched   all   have   released   CSR   reports   detailing   environmental   targets   and   commitments   since   2004.   Gildan   Activewear   was   the   last   of   investigated   firms   to   release   a   CSR   report,   releasing   its   first   report   in   2004.   The   CSR   reports   cover   both

environmental  and  social  targets;  however,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study  only  environmental  targets  will   be  analyzed.  Currently,  CSR  reports  outlining  each  retailer's  social  and  environmental  commitment  are   released  separately  from  their  annual  reports  indicating  sustainability  actions  are  not  integrated  directly   into   core   business   practices.   It   can   be   argued   that   change   will   more   readily   occur   when   retailers   release   sustainability  targets  and  initiatives  directly  in  their  annual  reports.

4.3  Qualitative  Content  Analysis  
Best  Practices   Assessing   the   sample   population   of   the   fashion   retailers'   published   reports;   sustainability   was   unanimously  reported  on  and  highlighted  as  playing  a  key  role  in  business  practices.  The  percentage  of   the   word   sustainable/sustainability   has   increased   each   year   from   2009   to   2013   across   all   CSR   reports   from  Adidas,  Gildan,  H&M,  Inditex  and  Nike  (shown  in  table  4.2  below).    The  increase  in  the  use  of  the   word   sustainability   each   year   demonstrates   that   retailers   understand   the   importance   of   reporting   on   sustainability   issues   throughout   their   supply   chains.   The   following   sections   will   unpack   the   sustainability   commitments   of   each   of   the   five   chosen   retailers   by   tracking   their   waste,   water,   CO2,   and   energy   targets   and   commitments.   Waste,   water,   CO2   and   energy   are   the   four   key   environmental   concerns   addressed  by  fashion  retailers.

Using  NVivo  qualitative  analysis  software,  a  word  search  indicated  the  100  most  frequently  used  words   in  publications  from  the  sample  retail  set  from  2009  to  2013.  Table  3  displays  the  most  frequently  used   words   associated   with   sustainability   used   across   all   reports   over   the   reporting   periods   of   2009-2013.   Sustainable   was   the   most   frequent   word,   appearing   4280   times   (0.573%)   across   all   reports.   Environmentally   was   used   second   most   frequently   (0.40%)   followed   by   socially   (0.28%)   and   risks   (0.23%).        As   stated   in   Chapter   1,   there   does   not   yet   exist   a   singular   definition   of   sustainability   for   the   fashion   industry,   and   this   is   demonstrated   through   the   CSR   reports   of   each   of   the   sample   population   addressed   in   the   section   below.   Unlike   certification   programs   like   LEED,   which   address   building   efficiency   and   sustainability   in   a   standardized   way,   there   is   no   standard   for   the   fashion   industry   to   report   on   sustainability   targets.   Due   to   this   lack   of   consistency,   comparison   on   retail   sustainability   standards   is   difficult   (Gam,   2007).   Each   company   defines   sustainability   targets   and   objectives   in   their   own   format.   However,   there   are   trends   that   emerge   throughout   each   report.   Table   4   showcases   the   trends   on   the   reporting   of   sustainability-orientated   words   (using   the   sample   identifying   sustainability   words   from   Weise   et   al   (2010)   and   SSI   (2014))   from   2012   to   2013.   Sustainable/sustainability   remains   the   most   frequently   used   word   both   in   2012   and   2013.      Water,   fair   trade,   energy   and   organic   follow   in   frequency   between  2012-2013  with  the  word  environmental  falling  in  frequency  between  2012-2013.            Table      highlights   the   five-year   trend   (2009-2013)   and   frequency   of   sustainability,   water,   fair   trade,   energy  and  organic  as  reported  across  all  five  retailers'  CSR  reports.  The  search  shows  that  energy  and   organic  are  declining  in  frequency.  Figure  6  reveals  the  use  of  the  word  fair  trade  has  seen  a  significant   peak  in  frequency  from  2012  to  2013.  This  may  be  attributed  to  the  collapse  of  the  garment  factory  in   Rana  Plaza  in  2013  where  1,137  garment  workers  lost  their  lives.  Following  the  collapse,  retailers  have   placed   a   greater   emphasis   on   worker   safety   and   working   conditions.      2013   saw   major   retailers   come   together  to  sign  safety  agreements  for  Bangladesh  through  the  Bangladesh  Safety  Accord.  In  addition,   large  retail  brands  such  as  Patagonia  and  MEC  are  beginning  to  offer  Fairtrade  options.  Fairtrade  in  the   fashion  industry  will  be  addressed  further  in  Chapter  5.

Document  content  analysis  and  review  of  CSR  reports  indicates  that  the  sample  set  of  retailers  report  on   both   environmental   and   social   issues.   Social   commitments   can   include,   but   are   not   limited   to   the   following;  workplace  safety,  factory  audits,  right  to  unionize,  anti-harassment  standards,  fair  pay,  child   labour,   employee   diversity,   health   care   services   and   training.   Each   of   the   sample   set   of   retailers   addresses   social   concerns   throughout   their   reports.   While   this   research   does   acknowledge   that   social   concerns  for  the  fashion  sector  must  be  included  in  comprehensive  voluntary  initiatives,  for  the  purpose   of  this  paper  research  focuses  on  environmental  concerns  and  issues.        The  study's  sample  retail  set  all  reported  on  their  environmental  commitments  as  part  of  their  overall   CSR  reporting  framework.  Waste  management  and  reduction,  water  reduction  (specifically  focusing  on   closed   loop   systems),   energy   efficiency   and   CO2   reduction   were   highlighted   across   all   reports   as   leading

4.5  Environmental  Targets  
The   five   sample   retailers   reported   on   environmental   targets   extensively   throughout   their   CSR   reports.   As  the  NVivo  word  content  analysis  demonstrated,  sustainability  was  the  dominating  trend  throughout   the   reports.   Specific   targets   and   commitments   saw   an   increase   in   reporting   from   2009   to   2013.   The   words  Water,  Fair  Trade,  Energy  and  Organic  saw  an  increase  in  prevalence  throughout  the  reports  from   2009-2013.  The  increase  in  the  use  of  `fair  trade'  throughout  the  sample  set  of  retailers  demonstrates  an   emerging  recognition  of  the  need  to  address  both  sustainability  and  ethical  issues  throughout  the  supply   chain.  Further  examination  of  the  CSR  reports  revealed  that  the  term  fair  trade  is  most  often  used  when   referring  to  cotton.    The  use  of  fair  trade  to  address  the  entire  supply  chain  has  not  yet  emerged  among   major  retailers.  Further  detail  on  fair  trade  in  the  fashion  industry  will  be  addressed  in  Chapter  5.        The  following  section  will  detail  the  targets  set  out  by  each  of  the  five  retail  set  across  the  four  major   sectors;   waste,   water,   energy   and   CO2.   Using   the   CSR   reports,   the   research   will   track   progress   and   trends  across  the  sample  set.

4.5.1  Waste  Management  
Hazardous  and  non-hazardous  waste  diversion  and  reductions  rates  were  reported  throughout  each  of   the  2013  CSR  reports  across  the  sample  set.  Overall,  retailers  had  simple  waste  targets;  use  less  and  buy   less  to  reduce  impact  throughout  the  value  chain  (Nike,  Adidas,  H&M,  Gildan  &  Inditex,  2013).        H&M's   CEO,   Karl-Johan   Person,   wrote   in   the   introduction   of   H&M's   2013   CSR   Report   that   when   he   looked   ahead   to   the   future   of   H&M   and   fashion   he   envisioned   a   future   where   the   way   fashion   is   consumed  and  made  will  change.  Person  stated  (2013,  p.3)                  Generally,   all   retailers   in   the   sample   set   have   set   waste   reduction   goals   through   pattern   efficiency,   landfill  diversion  and  reuse.  In  2012,  Nike  released  Nike  Materials  Sustainability  Index  (MSI)  that  became   part   of   the   Higg   Index   used   by   the   Sustainable   Apparel   Coalition.   The   MSI   is   intended   to   create   a   common  language  and  set  of  definitions  related  to  a  garments  material  footprint.  NIKE  also  released  the   NIKE   Making   It   App   for   smartphones,   which   allows   designers   and   consumers   to   track   the   environmental   footprint   and   impact   of   over   30   different   textiles.   The   Making   It   App   allows   designers   and   consumers   to   compare   the   impacts   of   textiles   against   one   another   in   terms   of   CO2,   energy,   waste,   water   use   and   chemistry   (NIKE,   2013).   Despite   these   advances   and   innovations   put   forth   by   the   fashion   industry,   there   does  not  yet  exist  common  standard  for  tracking  sustainability  practices.  Each  of  the  five  retailers  used   different   reporting   methods,   making   a   direct   comparison   difficult.   Retailers   compared   environmental   improvements  against  different  base  years,  and  data  was  not  tracked  consistently  between  the  retailers.     However,   throughout   the   CSR   reports   of   the   sample   retail   set,   trends   emerged   on   waste   reduction   targets.  Detailed  below  is  an  overview  of  the  waste  reduction  strategies  set  forth  by  the  five  retailers.   I  hope  that  we  will  produce  fashion  in  a  closed  loop,  using  less  of  our  planet's   resources  and  reducing  waste  instead.  For  the  resources  that  we  still  need,     we  must  share  them  fairly  between  today's  and  future  generations.  That     means  for  example  that  today  we  are  setting  the  direction  so  that  we  play  our     part  in  ensuring  there  will  be  enough  clean  water  for  everyone.

   Table   7   depicts   the   targets   each   retailer   has   set   in   their   waste   management   strategy.   Targets   include   overall   waste   reduction.   Both   Adidas   and   Gildan   set   a   target   in   2010   to   reduce   waste   sent   to   landfills   by   25%   by   2015.   In   2013   Gildan   met   their   2010   target   reducing   their   waste   by   25%,   in   addition,   of   the   waste   generated   91%   was   recycled   (Gildan,   2013).   Gildan   is   re-evaluating   their   processes   and   will   set   new  goals  for  2015.  Adidas  launched  a  `low  waste  initiative'  to  maximize  performance  while  minimizing   waste   and   set   a   target   of   25%   waste   reduction   per   employee   by   2015.   Both   NIKE   and   Adidas   set   aggressive  targets  for  their  footwear  manufacturing  to  improve  efficiency  in  the  manufacturing  process   of   their   shoes   and   in   improving   their   shoeboxes.   Nike's   waste   target   is   to   achieve   a   10%   reduction   from   finished  goods  throughout  the  entire  supply  chain,  including  packaging  from  their  2011  baseline  through   to   2015.   To   address   these   targets,   NIKE   began   working   on   packaging   efficiency   in   1995,   making   their   shoeboxes  from  100%  recycled  content.  Since  1995,  they  have  reduced  the  weight  of  the  box.  The  new   box  is  a  3%  weight  reduction  from  their  2011  baseline.        End-of   life   and   consumer   engagement   in   textile   recycling   were   priorities   for   both   H&M   and   Inditex.   Inditex  has  begun  to  look  at  the  end-of  life  of  their  garments  believing  disposal  of  garments  to  be  the   last   option,   stating   that   they   believe   `the   best   way   to   reuse   a   garment   or   textile   waste   is   that   which   modifies  the  product  as  little  as  possible'  (Inditex,  2013,  p.87).       H&M's   2013   waste   reduction   targets   focused   heavily   on   reuse   and   recycling   of   garments.   In   2012,   H&M   partnered   with   I:CO,   a   leader   in   textile   recycling,   to   launch   an   initiative   collecting   clothing   from   consumers   at   H&M   retail   locations.   By   the   end   of   2013,   all   H&M   retail   locations   were   equipped   with   consumer   recycling   boxes   to   encourage   consumers   to   recycle   their   textile   waste.   In   2013,   Inditex   engaged   in   consumer   recycling   through   its   brand   Tempe,   in   collaboration   with   A   Puntadas   to   make   mouse  pads  from  reused  leather  waste  from  cutting  room  floors  and  samples.    The  leather  mouse  pads   were  then  sold  at  Tempe  stores.

Retailers  tracked  their  water  footprint  throughout  the  entire  supply  chain,  demonstrating  that  it  is  the   processing   of   raw   materials   and   dyeing   that   generates   the   most   use   of   water.   Each   of   the   retailers   acknowledged   the   impact   of   water   in   the   processing   phase   citing   the   need   for   closed   loop   systems   to   address  these  concerns.    H&M's  2013  report  acknowledges  the  impact  of  cotton,  their  most  widely  used   fiber.   While   cotton   is   a   natural   fiber   that   offers   many   design   advantages,   it   presents   many   concerns   specifically  regarding  water  use  and  pesticides  (addressed  in  Chapter  1  and  2).  The  average  cotton  t-shirt   from  H&M  requires  11  bathtubs  of  water  to  grow  (H&M,  2013).    To  address  this  concern,  H&M  began   working  with  BCI  in  2002  to  begin  to  source  more  responsible  cotton.  H&M  uses  recycled  cotton  and  BCI   cotton   in   order   to   address   the   environmental   concerns   of   conventional   cotton   production.   H&M   has   increased  their  BCI  and  organic  cotton  consumption,  by  2013,  15.8%  of  cotton  sourced  by  H&M  was  BCI,   organic  or  recycled.        All  five  of  the  sample  set  of  retailers  now  source  a  portion  of  organic  cotton  in  their  supply  chains.  All   retailers,  with  the  exception  of  Gildan  now  source  a  portion  of  their  cotton  from  BCI  with  each  retailer   setting  targets  to  increase  the  amount  of  organic  cotton  sourced  each  year.        Industrial   dyeing   in   the   fashion   industry   contributes   17-20%   of   industrial   freshwater   pollution.   It   is   estimated   that   280,000   tonnes   of   dyestuffs      (about   10-15%   of   total   dyestuffs)   used   during   the   manufacturing   phase   is   released,   untreated,   into   the   environment   each   year   (Greenpeace   Detox   Campaign).  90.5%  of  Gildan's  total  water  demands  are  a  result  of  its  dyeing  process  (Gildan,  20130).  A   wide  range  of  organic  compounds  and  complex  structures  are  used  for  textile  dyeing  and  finishing.  The   wastewater   produced   during   the   processing   phase   is   not   always   biodegradable   and   can   pose   environmental   concern.      In   2011,   Greenpeace   launched   their   Detox   Campaign   `...to   expose   the   direct   links   between   global   clothing   brands,   their   supplier   and   toxic   water   pollution   around   the   world'   (Greenpeace   Detox   Campaign).   Greenpeace   asked   major   retailers   around   the   world   to   commit   to   become   toxic   free   by   2020.   Each   of   the   five   retailers   has   signed   on   to   the   Detox   Campaign.   In   2013,   Gildan   completed   construction   on   their   first   brine   recovery   system   at   one   of   their   textile   factories   in   Honduras.  The  system  mechanically  recovers  salt  from  dye  house  effluents;  the  salt  and  water  are  then   reused   throughout   different   parts   of   the   dyeing   process.      By   the   end   of   2014,   Gildan   is   set   finish   the   interconnection   piping   to   its   facilities   in   Honduras   to   include   the   recovered   brine   into   the   process,

4.5.3  Energy  Use  
The  sample  retail  set  highlighted  the  consumer  end-phase  as  one  the  most  energy  intensive  phases  in   the  garment  lifecycle.  Lynn  (2010)  claims  that  washing  and  drying  garments  can  account  for  an   estimated  82%  of  energy  use  in  a  garment's  lifecycle.  However,  NIKE  reports  total  energy  consumption   of  a  garment  in  the  `consumer  use  phase'  accounts  for  24%  of  overall  energy.  Similarly,  H&M  states  that   26%  of  a  garment's  climate  impacts  occur  in  the  consumer  phase.  H&M  addresses  the  issue  of  consumer   care  through  their  conscious  actions.  In  2011,  H&M  partnered  with  Ginetex,  the  current  leader  in  global   standard  care  labelling  systems.  H&M's  target  is  to  develop  a  common  and  mainstreamed  consumer   facing  care  label  that  encourages  consumers  to  care  for  their  clothing  in  a  more  sustainable  way  by   reducing  the  water  temperature  of  washing  machines  from  60C  to  30C.  The  Conscious  Care  label  states   that  reducing  the  temperature  of  the  washing  machine  by  half  requires  50%  less  energy  (H&M,  2013).   H&M  is  on  target  to  have  all  products  carrying  the  conscious  care  label  by  the  end  of  2014.        NIKE  reported  that  the  design  and  material  phase  accounted  for  54%  of  its  overall  direct  energy   consumption.  Material  production,  from  growing  cotton  to  extracting  oil  for  polyester  and  to  raising   livestock  for  leather,  represents  23%  of  total  energy  use  throughout  the  value  chain  for  NIKE.    Adding   material  processing  phases  such  as  dyeing  and  finishing,  energy  consumption  increases  to  54%  of  total   energy  use.        Renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  were  stated  as  goals  across  the  sample  set.  H&M  now  sources   18%  of  its  entire  energy  from  renewable  energy  and  147  of  its  retail  locations  are  engaged  in  energy   efficiency  programs.  Inditex  now  sources  45%  of  its  energy  from  renewable  sources  at  its  head  offices   and  factories.  Gildan  did  not  report  on  energy  efficiency,  but  instead  reported  an  increase  in  overall   energy  consumption  in  2013  over  2012  levels.  This  increase  in  energy  consumption  can  be  attributed  to

Retailers   cited   numerous   challenges   to   improving   overall   sustainability   throughout   the   supply   chain.   Challenges  and  barriers  include;  lack  of  common  standards;  continually  changing  information  regarding   materials,   lack   of   access   to   information   (for   designers),   and   insufficient   focus   on   materials   innovation   (NIKE  CSR  2013).  NIKE  reported  that  improving  environmental  standards,  including  reducing  waste  and   improving  efficiency  could  improve  the  company's  competitiveness  (NIKE  CSR,  2013).    Firms  cited  that   reducing   their   contributions   to   climate   change   was   the   primary   aim   of   their   sustainability   strategies   (Adidas,  Gildan,  H&M,  Inditex  &  NIKE,  2013).  Each  retailer  set  out  a  number  of  specific  targets  relating  to   energy,   CO2   emissions,   waste   and   water.   NIKE   remains   at   the   forefront   of   innovation,   creating   the   Material   Sustainability   Index,   rating   materials   on   their   sustainability   factors,   energy,   water   and   chemistry.  More  efficient  materials  are  rated  more  favourably,  standing  a  better  chance  of  being  chosen   by  NIKE  designers  (NIKE,  2013).

This   summary   of   the   CSR   reports   of   five   of   the   leading   fashion   retailers   demonstrates   the   next   potential   shift   in   the   industry,   towards   addressing   sustainability   across   the   supply   chain.   The   1990s   witnessed   isolated   incidents   affecting   individual   companies   like   Nike   for   accusations   of   the   use   of   child   labour.   The   2000s   witnessed   an   overhaul   of   corporate   governance   practices   through   failures   of   the   like   of   Enron.   The   collapse   of   Rana   Plaza   in   Bangladesh   in   2013   accelerated   these   trends   of   holding   corporations   responsible.  Following  the  collapse,  retailers  have  come  together  to  address  safety  and  social  concerns   at   offshore   factories   through   the   creation   of   accords   like   the   Bangladesh   Safety   Accord.   Increasingly,   boards,  in  all  business  sectors,  are  looking  to  improve  their  CSR  strategies  (SSI  Review  2014).          These  five  retailers  demonstrate  the  advances  in  sustainability  practices.  H&M  claims  to  be  a  leader  in   sustainability  by  making  a  big  investment  in  sustainability,  and  advocating  to  consumers  through  their   `Conscious   Collection'   line.      H&M   claims   sustainability   is   more   than   a   PR   initiative,   and   has   refused   to   work   with   suppliers   that   will   not   comply   with   their   sustainable   and   social   standards.   Like   NIKE,   H&M   states   sustainability   that   respects   both   planet   and   people   is   a   business   case,   beyond   a   sustainability   case,   as   factories   with   strong   employee   practices   see   no   strikes   (H&M,   2013).      As   some   of   the   largest   retailers  in  the  world,  Adidas,  Gildan,  H&M,  Inditex  and  NIKE  have  significant  impact  over  the  future  of   sustainability  in  the  fashion  industry.           Complete   lifecycle   assessments   (LCA)   allow   companies   to   highlight   areas   of   concern   throughout   their   supply   chains.   GIldan   began   conducting   LCAs   in   2010   where   they   discovered   water   consumption   and   disposal,   in   textile   manufacturing,   have   significant   environmental   impacts   (Gildan,   2013).   Since   2010,   Gildan  has  been  looking  at  ways  to  address  their  water  consumption  and  disposal  processes.  H&M  is  is   addressing   post-consumer   waste   and   disposal   by   acting   on   behalf   of   their   consumers   by   providing   an   easy  way  to  recycle  their  textile  waste  directly  at  H&M  locations.    Kozlowski,  Bardecki  &  Searcy  (2012)   highlight  the  importance  of  lifecycle  assessment  throughout  the  fashion  supply  chain  siting  that  an  LCA   can   help,   despite   the   long   and   complicated   lifecycle   of   garment   production,   provide   an   overall   environmental  profile.  LCAs  can  help  retailers  discover  how  environmental,  social  and  financial  aspects   of  the  fashion  supply  chain  are  all  connected  and  demonstrate  how  they  interact  (Kozlowski,  Bardecki  &   Searcy,  2012).          The   material   phase   remains   the   most   resource   heavy   phase,   using   the   most   water   and   toxins   throughout  the  supply  chain.  Each  of  the  retailers  from  the  sample  set  are  addressing  the  environmental

concerns  presented  by  conventional  materials  such  as  cotton  and  polyester  by  looking  to  less  intensive   materials   including   organic   and   better   cotton   and   recycled   polyester.      The   use   of   organic   or   better   cotton  is  on  the  rise,  with  each  of  the  five  companies  setting  targets  to  increase  the  amount  of  better   cotton   throughout   their   supply   chain.   H&M   first   partnered   with   BCI   in   2002   and   remains   an   active   member.   Since   2010,   in   partnership   with   WWF   and   Solidaridad,   300,000   cotton   farmers   have   been   trained  to  produce  BCI  (H&M  2013).  Through  BCI  farmers  receive  the  know-how  and  tools  to  produce   cotton  with  less  impact  on  the  environment  while  increasing  their  profit.  H&M  set  a  2015  target  to  train   1  million  farmers  by  2015.        The  lack  of  cohesive  standards  to  address  the  environmental  impacts  generated  by  the  fashion  industry   make  a  direct  comparison  difficult.  Each  of  the  retailers  reported  on  Waste,  Water,  Energy  and  CO2,  but   to   varying   degrees.   In   addition,   retailers   used   different   base   years   to   set   standards   and   targets.   As   such,   an   overall   comparison   of   total   waste   reduction,   water   reduction,   energy   reduction   and   CO2   reduction   could  not  be  made,  making  it  difficult  to  see  overall  trends.  The  retailers  all  acknowledged  the  need  to   improve  their  sustainability  standards  and  metrics.  CSR  reports  have  become  more  in  depth  each  year;   the   next   step   could   be   to   create   an   industry   standard   for   reporting,   allowing   for   direct   comparison   between  companies.        Companies   like   NIKE   state   that   improving   environmental   standards   can   improve   a   company's   competitiveness.  NIKE's  comprehensive  CSR  report  uses  scenario  planning  to  understand  the  potential   impact   of   their   sustainability   actions   on   their   business   and   plan   accordingly.   NIKE   looks   beyond   their   processes  to  understand  how  external  issues  such  as  climate  change  and  resource  scarcity  might  affect   business   (NIKE,   2013).   This   understanding   of   external   influences   such   as   climate   change   on   business   practices   and   the   financial   and   social   interconnections   is   what   will   allow   the   fashion   industry   to   see   wider   change   adopted.   Addressing   environmental   concerns   cannot   be   seen   as   add   on,   but   rather   something  that  must  be  integrated  into  the  company's  core  structures.  With  the  creation  of  a  standard   initiative,   code   or   labeling   program   that   addresses   environmental   concerns   presented   throughout   the   fashion  supply  chain  will  make  future  research  into  sustainability  trends  easier  to  track.    Chapter  6  will   highlight  leading  retailers  that  have  taken  sustainability  on  as  part  of  their  mission  and  used  it  to  their   competitive  advantage.

Chapter  5  Lesson  Drawing:  Fair  Trade  Coffee  and   Sustainable  Fashion    
5.1  Introduction      
Research   is   looking   to   find   parallels   between   fair   trade   type   certification   for   coffee   and   sustainable   certification  for  fashion,  particularly  focusing  on  cotton.  This  chapter  looks  to  fair  trade  type  certification   schemes  for  lessons  that  can  be  applied  to  the  sustainable  fashion  market.  Literature  demonstrates  that   sustainable   coffee   production   is   one   of   the   more   mature   markets   in   operation,   and   has   acted   as   a   testing  ground  for  voluntary  initiatives  across  commodities.    Certification  for  coffee  dates  back  to  1967;   however,  the  first  certification  explicitly  targeting  coffee  was  introduced  in  Holland  in  1988.     The  coffee   sector   has   seen   incredible   growth   over   the   past   10   years   along   with   an   increase   in   new   schemes   and   mainstream   adaptation.     This   chapter   will   outline   the   growth   of   fair   trade   type   certification   and   its   impact   on   farmers   and   the   environment.     Fair   trade   certification   has   extended   to   cotton   production,   thus  making  for  a  good  comparison  for  the  fashion  industry.    Of  the  many  textiles  used  in  the  fashion   industry,  cotton  is  the  most  widely  used  and  as  such  will  be  the  focus  of  research.    Voluntary  initiatives   for  both  the  coffee  and  cotton  industry  will  be  highlighted  and  compared  based  on  their  mission,  retail   involvement,   auditing   process,   commercial   conditions,   history   and   supply   chain   traceability.   Research   will  draw  parallels  between  both  coffee  and  cotton.     

5.1.2  How  Fair  Trade-Type  Certifications  Work     
Fair   trade-type   certification   functions   as   a   multi   stakeholder   process   addressing   both   social   and   environmental   standards   in   the   coffee   sector.     Fair   trade-type   certifications   aim   to   ensure   more   equitable   trading   arrangements   for   disadvantaged   farmers   and   producers   and   to   promote   social   and   environmental  sustainability  in  the  agricultural  sector  by  developing  standards  and  providing  technical   support.   Standards   are   implemented   through   the   multi   stakeholder   process   by   a   third   party   entity.     Third   party   certification   allows   for   separate   auditors   to   ensure   that   coffee   brands   and   farmers   meet   their   requirements.   Individual   coffee   brands   must   go   through   the   certification   process   using   the   third   party   auditor   before   they   can   use   the   label.   Consumers   identify   and   recognize   labels   as   addressing   both   environmental   and   social   issues.   Fair   trade-type   certification   addresses   issues   of   maintaining   biodiversity,  climate  change,  worker  health  and  safety  and  poverty.  Pricing  premiums  for  certified  coffee   ranges  from  1  to  30%,  (in  2012).

Following   the   2001   coffee   crisis,   fair   trade-type   certified   coffee   has   grown   to   represent   10%   of   total   coffee  sales.    Fair  trade  type  certification  for  coffee  has  seen  considerable  growth,  resulting  in  social  and   environmental  improvements  for  farmers  growing  fair  trade  coffee.  In  2012,  3.3  million  metric  tonnes  of   fair   trade-type   certified   coffee   were   produced,   of   which   840,000   metric   tonnes   were   sold   as   certified,   representing  25%  of  certified  coffee  produced  and  10%  of  global  production  (SSI  Review  2014).  Certified   coffee   offers   poverty   reduction   for   producers   in   developing   countries   and   ensures   equitable   trading   arrangements   for   small   producers.     It   is   estimated   that   20-25   million   farmers   grow   coffee   globally   on   10.5  million  hectares  harvested.     

5.1.3  Fair  trade  coffee  and  sustainable  fashion  
Fair  trade-type  certification  for  coffee  was  chosen  as  a  comparison  for  sustainable  fashion,  specifically   cotton  manufacturing,  as  coffee  and  cotton  share  many  similarities.    Cotton  and  coffee  provide  the  units   of   analysis   to   compare   the   specialty   coffee   industry   and   the   fast   fashion   industry.   While   the   comparison   is   not   perfect,   the   two   industries   provide   significant   similarities.   Both   crops   present   social   and   environmental  concerns  requiring  significant  amounts  of  water  and  pesticides  to  grow  and  rely  on  cheap   labour  to  harvest.  Both  cotton  and  coffee  are  widely  grown  in  developing  countries  (with  the  exception   of   cotton   grown   in   the   US)   where   developing   countries   rely   on   the   export   of   these   crops.   Coffee   was   chosen   as   a   comparison   over   a   label   like   `organic'   for   food,   as   the   organic   movement   is   seen   as   a   health   movement.  Consumers  do  not  look  to  fair  trade-type  coffee  or  sustainable  fashion  as  a  health  concern.   The  comparison  as  noted  in  Chapter  1  is  not  perfect;  for  example,  there  are  specific  retail  facing  coffee   shops,   but   no   retail   facing   cotton   shops.   Fashion   offers   a   more   complex   supply   chain,   where   cotton   production   only   accounts   for   a   portion   of   the   supply   chain.   However,   as   demonstrated   in   Chapter   4,   the   manufacturing   of   textiles   for   fashion   plays   a   major   role   in   the   environmental   impacts   of   garment   production.    Table  11  below  illustrates  the  commonalities  and  differences  between  coffee  and  cotton.        Cotton   Labour  intensive   Water,  energy,  pesticide   intensive   Grown  in  developing   countries  and  US   Insecure  supply  chain*   Ethics  based   Cotton  is  made  into  a  textile   and  then  consumed  by   Coffee   Labour  intensive   Water  and  pesticide  intensive   Grown  in  developing   countries   Insecure  supply  chain*   Ethics  based   Coffee  is  the  end  product

defined  by  high  volatility  and  long  term  declining  prices.        Fair   trade   consumer   facing   labels,   (FLO,   Rainforest   Alliance   and   Fair   trade   Certified)   have   become   recognizable   and   trusted   labels   among   consumers,   specifically   for   coffee,   tea,   chocolate   and   sugar.   As   such,   the   fair   trade   labeling   and   certification   will   be   used   to   compare   and   contrast   current   initiatives   within  the  fashion  sector.  Fair  trade  coffee  and  the  fashion  industry  share  similarities  as  both  deal  with   consumable   goods   often   produced   in   a   developing   nation   where   environmental   and   labour   standards   are   lower   than   where   they   are   sold   in   the   market.   As   one   of   the   most   mature   markets   currently   in   operation,   the   coffee   market   has   operating   almost   as   a   testing   ground   for   many   of   the   voluntary   initiatives   across   commodities.   The   growth   of   both   production   and   sales   of   sustainable   coffee   continues   to  grow  at  a  rapid  pace,  with  new  initiatives  entering  the  market  UTZ  (2002)  and  4C  (2006)  (SSI  Review,   2014).  According  to  the  SSI  2014  Review,  trends  demonstrate  that  sustainable  and  compliant  coffee  is   here  to  stay,  and  soon  one  standard  or  another  may  become  a  requirement  for  the  market.        Fair   trade-type   coffee   certification   was   chosen   over   other   labels,   as   fair   trade   has   already   begun   to   integrate  with  the  fashion  industry,  specifically  cotton.  Fair  trade  cotton  is  on  the  rise,  and  production  of   fair   trade   cotton   saw   a   50%   growth   in   2012   (SSI   Review,   2014).      Fair   trade   certified   clothing   is   slowly   entering  the  market,  predominantly  through  fair  trade  certified  cotton.  In  2015,  Patagonia  is  looking  to   further  integrate  fair  trade  clothing  into  their  product  line.  In  addition,  smaller  retailers  are  selling  fair   trade.  The  Azadi  Project  located  in  Toronto,  Oliberte  Shoes,  the  first  Fair  Trade  Certified  shoe  factory  in   Africa,   and   MEC   all   offer   fair   trade   garments.      Chapter   6   will   further   highlight   key   retailers   integrating   fair  trade  cotton  into  their  production.      Fair  trade  certification  is  label  and  consumer  driven  using  retailers  as  proxies  for  consumers,  working  in   a   business   to   consumer   model.   Fair   trade   has   a   remarkable   part   of   the   market   place   for   sustainable   purchasing.  In  order  to  properly  compare  the  fashion  initiatives  to  that  of  fair  trade  certification,  a  set  of   guidelines  has  been  set.  Voluntary  initiatives  will  be  assessed  based  on  the  following:  mission,  history,   commercial   conditions,   supply   chain   traceability,   certification   method,   consumer   communication   and   retail  involvement.

   Coffee,  similar  to  fast  fashion  at  the  current  time,  faced  media,  NGO  and  consumer  scrutiny  in  2000  as   the   industry   was   stung   by   charges   of   labour   rights   violations   in   Central   American   Plantations   with   the   threat   of   large-scale   protests   and   boycotts.   In   response,   the   coffee   industry   listened   to   consumer   demands,  fueled  by  the  fear  of  boycotts,  by  increasing  the  prevalence  of  fair  trade-type  coffee  options   (Jaffee,   2012).   Four   of   these   options-FLO   (fair   trade   labeling   organization),   Rainforest   Alliance,   4C   and   UTZ   will   be   highlighted   throughout   this   research.      The   coffee   crisis   resulted   in   stakeholder   collaboration   with   ICO   to   form   the   Sustainable   Coffee   Partnership,   which   called   for   greater   reporting   on   sustainability   standards   and   performance   data   in   the   coffee   industry   (SSI   Review,   2014).      Standard   compliant   production  in  the  coffee  industry  now  represents  40%  of  the  market  production  share  up  from  15%  over   2008    (SSI  Review,  2014).          Following  the  coffee  crisis  in  2001,  the  fair  trade  coffee  industry  faced  critiques  regarding  quality,  cost  to   consumer  and  availability.  The  onset  of  sustainable  fashion  has  seen  similar  challenges  with  sustainable   fashion  being  critiqued  for  its  high  price,  lack  of  availability  and  low  quality  or  low  design  aesthetic.    Fair   trade   coffee   certifiers   quickly   realized   that   relying   solely   on   ethics   would   not   sell   coffee.   In   order   to   convince  consumers  to  pay  a  premium,  the  coffee  had  to  be  high  quality  (Jaffee,  2012).  Fair  trade  coffee   certifiers   are   still   attempting   to   increase   their   market   presence   through   consumer   support   and   large   corporate   collaboration.   Fair   trade-type   certification   accounts   for   a   growing   share   of   market   production   (40%).    Sales  of  certified  coffee  represents  10%  of  the  market  share  (SSI  Review,  2014),  growing  from  0%   in  1990  following  the  coffee  crisis.  Fair  trade  certifiers  realized  the  link  between  marketing  and  labeling   activities.      Therefore,   consumer   facing   models   and   labels,   such   as   the   fair   trade   (FLO),   Fair   Trade   Certified   and   Rainforest   Alliance   labels   that   inform   consumers   about   production   practices   are   often   linked  with  educational  information.  Labeling  can  provide  a  way  for  brands  to  differentiate  themselves   from   their   competition.   Consumer   facing   models   seek   to   increase   consumer   demand   for   sustainable   products  (SSI  Review,  2014).  This  lesson  of  the  power  of  consumer  facing  labels  linked  with  educational   information  contributing  to  the  increase  in  demand  for  sustainable  goods  can  be  applied  to  the  fashion   industry.    By  providing  consumers  with  clear  labels  and  a  more  transparent  supply  chain  could  lead  to   greater  consumer  confidence  in  sustainable  fashion  thereby  creating  the  potential  for  greater  growth  to   the  sustainable  fashion  sector.

Just   as   fair   trade-type   certified   coffee   has   moved   away   from   selling   coffee   based   solely   on   an   ethical   premise,  the  fashion  industry  has  begun  to  shift  away  from  selling  sustainable  fashion  solely  based  on  its   ethics   and   sustainability   merits.   Initially   the   introduction   of   sustainable   fashion   was   met   with   design   criticism,  however  major  designers  and  retailers  realized  that  sustainable  fashion  must  stand  alongside   conventional   fashion   in   design,   aesthetic   and   accessibility.   Many   celebrities   are   placing   their   name   behind   the   need   for   sustainable   fashion.   Vivienne   Westwood   and   Stella   McCartney   have   been   long   time   champions   of   sustainable   fashion   and   Livia   Firth   created   the   green   carpet   challenge,   encouraging   celebrities  to  wear  sustainable  fashion  on  the  red  carpet.    In  addition  to  celebrity  support,  a  number  of   initiatives   have   emerged   to   promote   sustainable   fashion   and   textile   production.   The   Better   Cotton   Initiative  (BCI)  has  attempted  to  address  the  issues  of  accessibility  and  supply  of  cotton  by  providing  a   secure   supply   chain   of   `better   cotton',   by   creating   stability   in   the   cotton   production   supply   chain   through  farmer  training  programs.      The   Better   Cotton   Initiative   (BCI)   began   in   2005,   with   a   global   multi-stakeholder   consultation   process   involving   actors   from   along   the   cotton   supply   chain   (BCI   2011).   From   the   initial   consultation   the   BCI   created   six   core   components   to   establish   their   monitoring   system   which   include:   1.   Production   principles   and   criteria   to   provide   a   global   definition   of   `better   cotton';   2.   Farmer   support   to   promote   enabling   mechanisms   at   both   the   global   and   local   level;   3.   Farm   assessment   encouraging   farmer   improvement  through  results  and  learning  cycles;  4.  Supply  chain  to  connect  supply  and  demand  with   identifiable   100%   `better   cotton';   5.   Monitoring,   evaluating   and   learning   to   measure   progress   for   intended  impacts;  6.  Tools  to  function  as  guidelines  and  learning  forums  to  facilitate  exchange  of  best   practices  (BCI  2011).            Similar   to   the   many   fair   trade   coffee   certification   labels,   sustainable   fashion   offers   many   certification   schemes.   However,   fashion   differs   from   fair   trade   coffee   certifications,   in   that   fashion   certifications   address  one  aspect  of  the  supply  chain.    For  example,  fair  trade  certified  cotton  does  not  address  labour   or   environmental   conditions   where   the   cotton   is   milled   or   at   the   factories   where   garments   are   manufactured.   Similarly,   a   garment   factory   may   be   fair   trade   certified;   yet   the   textiles   manufactured   may   not   be   certified.   Patagonia   now   offers   a   line   of   women's   Fair   Trade   Certified   clothing,   however   this   only   ensures   that   sewing   factories   are   fair   trade   Certified,   not   the   textiles.      Patagonia   plans   to   to   incorporate  Fair  Trade  Certified  cotton  into  their  production  by  2015  (Patagonia,  2015).

While   fair   trade-type   certifications   for   coffee   address   both   environmental   and   social   concerns,   there   remains  controversy  over  how  to  engage  large  corporate  players.  Similarly,  sustainable  fashion  lacks  a   cohesive   and   widely   accepted   definition.   Social   responsibility   is   a   complex   issue   for   retailers   where   businesses   may   find   it   difficult   to   track   and   monitor   the   exact   factory   where   a   garment   was   manufactured   due   to   multiple   subcontractors   used   in   an   order.   Businesses   find   it   difficult   to   develop   transparent   reporting   practices   as   there   has   yet   to   be   an   agreed   upon   set   of   standards   defining   sustainable  fashion  (Dickson,  Loker  &  Eckman,  2009).        The  fashion  industry  now  faces  criticism  in  light  of  disasters  such  as  Rana  Plaza  in  April  of  2013  where   1,138   garment   workers   lost   their   lives   due   to   unsafe   working   conditions.   The   fashion   industry   is   now   doing  damage  control  to  repair  the  negative  social  and  environmental  implications  associated  with  the   industry.   Currently   `There   are   not   enough   rules   and   legislation   to   limit   pollution   in   the   fashion   supply   chain,   and   enforcement   in   some   jurisdictions   is   weak,   resulting   in   lower   retail   prices   for   fast   fashion   companies   (Meadows   1999,   p.   36).   The   scope   and   reach   of   the   fashion   industry   and   its   historical   reliance  on  cheap  labour  to  manufacture  has  led  to  intense  political  interest  in  both  the  developed  and   developing   worlds.   The   fashion   industry   has   been   shaped   by   international   trading   agreements.   The   transient   nature   of   the   industry,   where   a   garment   often   transcends   many   borders   in   its   lifecycle,   makes   regulation  difficult  to  monitor  and  uphold.  This  is  where  clear  voluntary  initiatives  (VI)  with  clear  labeling   schemes  can  play  a  role  in  shaping  the  future  of  sustainable  fashion.        Both  sustainable  fashion  and  fair  trade  coffee  share  similar  issues  in  regard  to  making  their  respective   movements'   mainstream.   Both   the   coffee   industry   and   the   fashion   industry   need   to   create   consumer   confidence   in   their   labels   in   order   to   increase   consumer   demand.   Fair   trade-type   coffee   has   seen   significant  gains  in  market  availability  and  share  since  its  introduction  to  the  market  in  1998;  however,   fair  trade  sales  at  10%  still  holds  only  a  minor  portion  of  global  coffee  sales  (SSI  2014).    One  core  issue   for  consumers  shopping  for  sustainable  fashion  is  a  lack  of  awareness  of  the  environmental  impacts  of   the   fashion   industry.   A   clear   label   linked   with   educational   information   for   consumers   could   lead   to   greater   consumer   awareness.   As   consumers   cited   a   fear   of   `greenwashing'   by   retailers,   a   third   party   certified  model  could  lead  to  greater  consumer  confidence.  In  addition,  a  clear  label  that  addresses  the   entire   lifecycle   could   lead   to   greater   consumer   confidence   and   a   greater   understanding   of   the   environmental  impacts  of  fashion.

5.2  Retailer  Collaboration  
Following   the   coffee   crisis   in   2000,   the   coffee   industry,   through   unprecedented   stakeholder   collaboration,   came   together   with   ICO   to   form   the   Sustainable   Coffee   Partnership.   The   proposals   resulting   from   the   partnership   later   gave   way   to   the   establishment   of   the   State   of   Sustainability   Initiatives   (SSI   Review   2014).      Following   the   collapse   of   Rana   Plaza,   the   fashion   industry   has   seen   an   increase  in  stakeholder  collaboration.  In  order  for  the  fashion  industry  to  follow  suit,  sustainable  fashion   must  be  `co-created'  (Cataldi,  Dickson  &  Grover,  2013).    Historically,  the  fashion  industry  has  operated   as  a  secretive,  protective  industry  based  on  competition.  In  order  for  sustainable  fashion  values  to  grow,   values   should   be   co-created   from   industry   players   within   to   provide   guidance   for   emerging   designers   and  brands  (Cataldi,  Dickson  &  Grover,  2013).  NIKE  is  attempting  to  do  this  through  their  Apparel  Design   Tool  and  Making  It  App.        The  Sustainable  Apparel  Coalition  (SAC),  created  by  a  number  of  large  retailers,  including  Adidas,  Gildan,   H&M,  Inditex  and  NIKE  is  attempting  to  address  sustainability  and  social  issues  throughout  the  fashion   supply   chain.   The   industry   led   initiative   tackles   both   sustainability   and   social   concerns   in   textiles   and   footwear.      The   SAC   created   the   Higg   Index,   an   indicator   based   assessment   tool   for   best   practices   and   sustainability  performance  in  apparel  and  footwear  (Sustainable  Apparel  Coalition,  2014).  The  tool  was  a   collaborative   process   based   on   the   Eco   Index   and   Nike's   Apparel   Environmental   Design   Tool   and   the   Global   Social   Compliance   Tool.   The   Higg   Index   was   updated   to   the   Higg   Index   2.0,   and   now   tests   the   entire  life-cycle  of  a  garment  right  to  end  of  use.  This  standard  was  developed  to  help  businesses  and   organizations   standardize   how   they   measure   and   evaluate   both   social   and   environmental   performances   across   the   supply   chain   (SAC,   2014).      The   SAC   provides   a   starting   point   for   the   sustainable   fashion   industry  through  a  collaboration  of  large  retailers  working  to  create  tools  to  measure  sustainability  and   labour  practices.  Currently,  the  Higg  Index  is  a  self-monitoring  tool  without  a  consumer-facing  label.        Fair  trade  certification  schemes  distinguish  themselves  from  other  social  movements  and  labels  through   their  breadth  in  addressing  both  social  and  environmental  concerns  and  tackle  trade  issues  along  with   productions   conditions   (Raynolds,   2009).      Fair   trade   offers   a   third   party   verification   for   brands   and   a   consumer-facing  label.  The  success  of  the  Fair  trade  movement  has  come  to  symbolize  a  counterpoint  to   the   socially   and   environmentally   destructive   characteristics   of   the   food   system   (Raynolds,   2009).   However,  the  rising  popularity  of  the  movement  has  placed  pressure  on   the  once  alternative  movement   to   become   embedded   in   the   mainstream   market   by   engaging   with   large   retailers   thus   incorporating

standard   business   norms   and   practices   (Reynolds,   2009).      Fair   trade   is   not   promoted   on   health   benefits,   but  rather  the  benefits  created  for  producers  through  environmental  stewardship  and  equity.    Fashion   must  rely  on  this  type  of  messaging  as  fashion  is  not  directly  linked  to  health  in  the  consumer's  mind.   Like   fair   trade   coffee,   sustainable   fashion   must   rely   on   creating   a   connection   between   consumer   and   producer  while  highlighting  the  impacts  along  the  supply  chain  in  order  to  be  successful.        Fair   trade   involves   complex   and   often   contradictory   projects   involving   a   multitude   of   stakeholders   pursuing   varying   objectives.      Creating   a   label   for   fashion   represents   an   even   more   complex   supply   chain   with   a   greater   number   of   stakeholders,   thus   making   the   issue   of   adopting   a   voluntary   initiative   or   labeling  scheme  that  much  more  difficult  to  implement.  Below,  figures   7  and  8  outline  the  coffee  and   the  cotton  supply  chain  from  production  to  consumption.

   This  key  element  of  creating  a  more  direct  connection  between  consumers  and  producers  is  lacking  in   the   fashion   industry.   The   fashion   industry   lacks   clear   and   cohesive   labeling   to   incite   consumer   confidence   (Gam,   2007).   Fair   trade-type   certification   schemes   for   coffee   have   offered   that   connection   for   consumers.   By   contrast,   to   date   the   fashion   industry   has   yet   to   implement   or   to   offer   a   mainstreamed   certification   scheme   or   label   to   generate   widespread   consumer   confidence   among   fashion  consumers.  The  SAC's  Higg  Index  2.0  offers  a  good  start,  but  lacks  third  party  verification  and  a   trusted   consumer-facing   label.   A   number   of   additional   voluntary   initiatives   and   labels   exist   specifically   for  the  fashion  industry  including  the  Better  Cotton  Initiative  (BCI),  MADE  BY,  Water<less,  Organic,  Eco   Label,  Cradle  to  Cradle  Certification  and  NICE.  Depending  who  you  ask,  there  are  over  300  eco  labels  for   the   fashion   industry.   Despite   this,   there   is   an   inconsistency   among   measurement,   criteria   and   word   usage  used  to  define  sustainable  fashion.

As   a   result   consumers   lack   confidence   in   labels   and   certifications   regarding   the   fashion   industry.   As   noted   earlier,   the   Fair   trade   label   (both   FLO   and   TransFair)   has   taken   root   in   the   fashion   industry   through   Patagonia,   MEC,   Oliberte   and   other   small   scale   designers.   However,   fair   trade   certification   in   the  fashion  industry  applies  to  only  part  of  the  supply  chain.  Oliberte  has  certified  their  shoe  factory  in   Ethiopia,  but  does  not  use  fair  trade  certified  products.

5.4  Learning  Lessons  from  Fair  Trade:  
It   is   not   likely   that   Fair   trade   certification,   or   any   labeling   scheme,   alone   will   completely   transform   markets   to   the   point   where   people   and   the   environment   are   at   the   center   of   production,   trade   and   consumption  (Taylor,  2004).    Instead,  change  requires  attention  and  action  both  formally  and  informally   to   show   mainstream   logics   and   practices   can   shift   organizational   trajectories   over   time.      Labeling   and   certification   play   an   important   role   in   this   shift   toward   more   sustainable   industries,   but   require   the   involvement  of  large  retail  actors.  However,  these  large  retail  actors  in  the  Fair  trade  movement  could   serve   to   undermine   the   very   logic   and   practices   set   out   by   Fair   trade   in   the   first   place.   Taylor   (2004)   argues   that   the   use   of   large-scale   retail   actors   highlights   the   issue   of   supply   and   demand   at   a   rate   suitable  for  large  retailers.  However,  as  stated  in  Chapter  4,  production  numbers  demonstrate  that  fair   trade-type  certified  coffee  (or  compliant  coffee)  far  exceeds  its  sales.        Fair   trade's   biggest   challenge   comes   from   the   rise   of   market   driven   corporate   buyers,   such   as   Starbucks   and  Nestle.  Fair  trade  has  attempted  to  embed  itself  in  the  market  exchange  within  a  system  of  social   and   moral   relations.   As   the   movement   has   continued   to   grow   and   attract   corporate   support   it   now

continues   to   attempt   to   push   back   against   the   same   market   it   has   penetrated.   Certifications   like   Fair   trade  are  gaining  attention  worldwide  with  their  promise  to  create  consumption  change.  Labels  stress   the   importance   of   shifting   the   market   paradigm   to   walk   the   line   of   globalization   by   placing   markets   first   and   prioritizing   people   and   development   (Taylor   2004).   Fair   trade's   capacity   to   effect   change   in   the   market   and   throughout   different   industries,   relies   on   it   moving   away   from   niche   markets   to   more   mainstream  markets.  Fashion,  as  an  industry,  can  learn  from  this  model  as  it  shifts  into  larger  retailers   such  as  Patagonia.        However,  this  shift  away  from  niche  markets  to  incorporation  of  larger  retailers  and  multinationals  must   function  as  a  hybrid  `...simultaneously  a  social  movement  and  an  alternative  market  structure'  (Jaffee,   2012,  p.1).  Fair  trade-type  models  for  both  coffee  and  fashion  must  operate  within  the  logic  of  market   capitalism   yet   function   as   an   alternative   to   unequal   economic   relations   surrounding   conventional   trade.   In  order  to  properly  function,  the  Fair  trade  model  must  use  structures  of  the  market  it  seeks  to  alter.   Large   retailers   have   acknowledged   the   environmental   impacts   of   their   production,   and   as   Chapter   4   demonstrates,   retailers   are   increasing   their   reporting   on   sustainability   measures   and   setting   more   aggressive  targets  to  address  environmental  concerns  along  their  supply  chains.        The   Fair   trade   movement   faces   skepticism   over   its   partnership   with   large   retailers   and   multinationals.   The   Fair   Trade   USA   movement   began   to   target   larger   firms   following   the   2000   price   crash   for   conventional  coffee.  Fair  Trade  USA  chose  Starbucks,  a  larger  specialty  roaster.  Starbucks  was  licensed   under   TransFair   to   sell   both   wholesale   and   brewed   coffee   at   all   its   US   stores   promising   to   purchase   653,000  pounds  in  2010,  with  an  increase  to  1  million  in  2011  (Jaeffee,  2012).  However,  this  represents   below  1%  of  all  Starbucks  supplies,  far  below  the  5%  minimum  fair  trade  requires  of  firms  in  order  to  use   the  seal.  The  Starbucks  partnership  and  purchase  of  fair  trade  coffee  increased  the  visibility  of  the  Fair   Trade   brand,   but   created   tension   between   Fair   Trade   USA   and   Fair   Trade   International.   In   2012,   Fair   Trade   USA   separated   from   FLO   and   trademarked   Fair   Trade   Certified.   In   order   to   create   a   sustainable   certification   scheme,   the   sustainable   fashion   certification   labels   must   find   a   way   to   address   these   complex  issues  of  incorporating  large  retailers  such  as  Adidas,  Gildan,  Inditex,  H&M  and  NIKE.     

5.5  Barriers  to  Implementing  CSR  Practices  
Currently,   there   is   no   set   standard   for   sustainability   reporting   for   the   fashion   industry.   Before   a   consumer-facing   label   can   be   implemented,   the   industry   must   come   together   to   create   a   standard

reporting   mechanism.   The   SAC   is   attempting   to   create   this   with   the   help   of   NIKE.   However,   the   SAC   remains  self-monitored.  In  order  to  become  trusted  by  consumers,  a  third  party  monitoring  for  the  SAC   is  needed.      

  
Beyond   a   lack   of   clarity   in   reporting,   consumers   lack   an   awareness   of   the   environmental   impacts   of   fashion.   NGO   campaigns   like   the   Greenpeace   Detox   Challenge   help   to   create   greater   consumer   awareness,  but  to  date  have  not  provided  a  long  time  media  presence  to  engage  the  public.  Educating   consumers  on  sustainable  fashion  will  be  a  pivotal  component  to  making  a  successful  VI  and  consumer- facing   label   for   the   fashion   industry.   Business   development   of   social   responsibility   is   difficult   to   implement.   Consumers   find   it   difficult   to   engage   with   sustainability   and   social   responsibility   due   to   a   lack   of   clarity   and   access   to   information.   Not   all   companies   provide   information   into   the   workings   of   their   supply   chains,   and   often   when   it   is   presented,   the   information   is   difficult   to   describe   (Dickson,   Locker   &   Eckman,   2013).   As   businesses   are   making   their   way   to   becoming   more   sustainable   and   compliant,  their  message  can  be  diluted.  Implementing  sustainability  is  not  black  and  white;  rather  it  is  a   complex  process  involving  gradual  change.       

5.6  Conclusion  
Fair   trade-type   certification   demonstrates   the   impact   a   consumer   facing   label   engaged   in   education,   with  strong  NGO  support  and  large  retail  inclusion,  can  have  on  a  market.  Fair  trade-type  certifications   have  become  relatively  mainstreamed,  and  captured  both  production  and  market  share  that  continue  to   grow  each  year.  Fashion  can  learn  from  fair  trade-type  certification  allowing  the  labeling  to  educate  and   inform  consumers  and  for  retailers  to  act  as  the  proxies  for  consumers.    Certifications  and  labels  like  fair   trade   gain   worldwide   attention   with   their   promise   to   create   consumption   change.   They   stress   the   importance  of  shifting  the  market  paradigm  by  placing  people  and  the  environment  in  the  market.        Fair   trade-type   certification   and   labeling   for   coffee   provides   a   holistic   and   cohesive   view   of   the   coffee   industry,   addressing   both   environmental   and   social   concerns.   Currently,   the   fashion   industry   lacks   a   cohesive   label   that   addresses   the   entire   supply   chain.   By   applying   lessons   from   fair   trade   compliant   coffee  certification,  the  fashion  industry  can  look  to  create  a  label  addressing  its  entire  supply  chain.  The   label   itself   will   not   completely   transform   the   market;   it   will   require   retailer   cooperation,   consumer   education   and   media   attention.   However,   as   consumers   cite   a   lack   of   trust   in   sustainable   claims   of  

  

82  

companies,   a   third   party   certified   label   that   addresses   the   entire   supply   chain   could   lead   to   greater   consumer  trust  and  an  increase  in  sustainable  fashion  purchases.       

Chapter  6  Role  of  retailers  as  proxies  for  consumers    
6.1  Introduction  
Voluntary  initiatives  and  awareness  campaigns  by  NGOs  may  be  used  to  generate  influence  beyond  the   direct   parties   involved   in   order   to   influence   both   producers   and   consumers   (Webb   2004).   Literature   demonstrates  that  retailers  can  lead  in  voluntary  initiatives  and  be  positioned  in  a  way  to  advocate  on   behalf  of  consumers  and  anticipate  future  demands  or  trends  (Webb  2004).  As  such,  retailers  have  the   unique   ability   to   implement   or   demand   producers   uphold   voluntary   codes   and   thus   may   act   as   `proxies'   for   consumers   while   anticipating   future   trends   in   sustainability.      It   remains   imperative   that   NGOs   and   retailers  work  together  in  order  to  create  credibility  for  industry  standards  and  codes  (Webb  2004).      This   chapter   highlights   the   unique   role   retailers   can   play   in   implementing   sustainability   into   their   supply   chains.      Literature   demonstrates   the   role   retailers   can   play   as   proxies   for   consumers,   by   doing   the   research   for   consumers   and   acting   on   behalf   of   environmentally   and   socially   responsible   consumers.   Large   retailers   with   strong   brand   recognition   may   try   to   mitigate   possible   criticisms   by   implementing   strong  CSR  strategies.  In  addition,  brands  look  to  identify  upcoming  trends  in  the  industry,  and  may  be   looking   to   enhance   their   reputation   as   a   socially   and   environmentally   responsible   brand.      Following   events   like   Rana   Plaza   and   the   negative   media   attention   that   followed,   companies   have   struggled   to   reverse   the   negative   effects   with   socially   and   environmentally   irresponsible   production   (Park,   2006).      As   a  result,  companies  looking  to  improve  their  competitiveness  and  improve  brand  reputation  may  look  to   more   sustainable   sourcing   and   production.   Retailers   function   as   proxies   as   they   do   the   work   for   the   consumers   by   anticipating   future   trends   in   the   industry   and   can   provide   the   avenue   for   consumers   to   purchase  sustainably  and  ethically.      Chapter  4  demonstrated  the  sustainability  initiatives  the  sample  set  of  retailers  have  incorporated  into   their  supply  chains.  The  content  analysis  highlighted  the  shortcomings  in  the  reporting  structure  where   there  is  no  set  standards.  NIKE  is  looking  to  address  this  by  working  with  the  SAC  to  improve  the  Higg   Index   so   that   retailers   can   use   the   same   language   and   implement   a   set   standard   for   reporting.   In   NIKE's   2014   CSR   report,   the   lack   of   a   set   standard   is   highlighted   as   major   issues   within   the   fashion   industry.   By   working  the  Sustainable  Apparel  Coalition,  NIKE  is  actively  pursuing  ways  to  implement  a  set-reporting

standard.   Chapter   5   drew   lesson   from   fair-trade   type   coffee   certification   for   the   fashion   industry,   demonstrating  the  role  that  large  retailers  can  play  in  implementing  voluntary  initiatives  and  exposing   consumers   to   initiatives   and   labels.      This   chapter   will   build   on   the   role   that   retailers   can   play   by   highlighting  two  key  fashion  retailers  that  have  addressed  sustainability  and  incorporated  it  directly  into   their  core  business  model.    Patagonia  and  Marks  &  Spencer  are  highlighted  as  two  leaders  in  sustainable   fashion.  Patagonia  is  a  sports  apparel  &  outdoor  retailer  and  Marks  &  Spencer  (M&S)  is  a  fast  fashion   retailer.     

6.2  Patagonia  
Patagonia,  founded  in  1972,  is  an  environmentally  conscious  outdoor  apparel  company,  spearheaded  by   founder,   Yvon   Chouinard.   As   an   avid   outdoorsman,   Chouinard   started   Patagonia   with   the   explicit   mission  to  create  a  company  with  limited  impact  on  the  natural  environment  with  a  mission  to  `Build  the   best   product,   cause   no   unnecessary   harm,   use   business   to   inspire   and   implement   solutions   to   the   environmental   crisis'   (Patagonia,   2014).   However,   while   Chouinard   holds   a   strong   commitment   to   the   environment,  Chouinard  acknowledges  that  Patagonia  is  a  product-based  business,  and  in  order  to  make   a  difference,  the  company  has  to  sell  their  products  and  make  a  profit.  Patagonia  demonstrates  the  role   a   retailer   can   play   in   acting   as   proxy   for   consumers   by   doing   research   for   its   consumers   in   order   to   provide   products   that   are   well   made,   functional   and   with   a   limited   environmental   impact.   Patagonia's   mission  was  formed  around  four  values:  quality,  integrity,  environmentalism,  and  innovation  to  provide     products  of  the  highest  quality  possible  (Patagonia,  2014).  In  addition  to  acting  as  proxy  for  consumers,   Patagonia   has   influenced   leaders   within   the   fashion   industry,   most   notably   through   its   use   of   organic   cotton  and  Synchilla,  a  fleece-like  material  made  from  recycled  pop  bottles.        Patagonia's   commitment   to   creating   garments   with   a   low   environmental   impact   caused   Patagonia   to   explore   the   life   cycle   impacts   of   four   of   their   major   textiles;   polyester,   nylon,   cotton   and   rayon   in   the   early   1990s.   Patagonia   discovered   cotton   generated   significant   environmental   and   social   costs.   As   cotton   accounted   for   20%   of   Patagonia's   products,   Chouinard   implemented   a   strategy   to   address   the   environmental   concerns,   giving   managers   18   months   to   substitute   organic   cotton   for   conventional   cotton   in   1994.   By   1996,   Patagonia   had   switched   all   of   their   cotton   products   to   organic   cotton   and   reduced   packaging   throughout   the   company   (Gardiner,   1997).   However,   this   came   at   a   cost   to   the   company  as  Patagonia  had  to  drop  lucrative  products  from  their  collection  due  to  their  increase  in  price.   While  making  the  transition  to  organic  cotton,  the  company  realized  that  profit  margins  would  have  to

be   lowered.   However,   consumer   demand   for   organic   cotton,   combined   with   Chouinard's   commitment   to   the   environment,   were   the   deciding   factors   for   the   transition   (Gardiner   1997).   Sourcing   organic   cotton  increased  production  costs  by  20%,  but  Patagonia  only  increased  prices  by  5%.  The  risk  paid  off   for   Patagonia   in   the   long   run   as   cotton   sales   increased   by   25%   in   in   1996   (Little,   2011).   In   addition,   Patagonia   set   the   precedent   for   other   companies   in   the   organic   cotton   industry   to   follow   suit,   with   Patagonia  providing  incentive  and  the  business  model  for  companies  like  NIKE  and  Walmart.        Patagonia's   pollution   prevention   effort   includes   a   life   cycle   analysis   to   determine   how   to   reduce   toxic   waste,  water  and  energy  use.  In  1993,  Patagonia  began  manufacturing  jackets  from  Synchilla,  a  fleece- like   fabric   made   of   recycled   pop   bottles.   Patagonia   was   the   first   outdoors   apparel   company   to   use   Synchilla   in   their   product   line.   By   2011,   Patagonia   had   recycled   over   86   million   soda   bottles   using   Synchilla   (Patagonia   2,   2014).   In   addition,   Patagonia   advocates   for   consumers   to   consume   and   purchase   less.   In   2012   for   Black   Friday,   Patagonia   launched   the   `don't   buy   me'   campaign   advocating   for   consumers  to  repair  their  old  Patagonia  wear  rather  than  buying  something  new.        Patagonia   demonstrates   that   a   commitment   to   the   environment   can   be   economically   feasible   and   beneficial   for   a   brand's   identity   as   the   company   grossed   154   million   US   in   1995   (Gardiner   1997),   with   sales   increasing   each   year,   with   600   million   in   revenues   in   2013   (Patagonia   3,   2014).   At   the   core   of   Patagonia   is   a   commitment   to   the   environment,   with   preventative   measures   integral   to   their   environmental  standards.  Patagonia  commits  1%  of  their  profit  or  10%  of  their  sales  (whichever  is  more)   to   environmental   organizations.   Since   1985,   they   have   donated   over   $25   million   to   over   1,000   organizations   (Patagonia   3,   2014).   In   2001   Chouinard   co-founded   1%   for   the   Planet,   an   alliance   for   businesses  like  Patagonia  who  commit  1%  of  their  profits  to  the  environment.  Since  its  inception,  over   1,477  members  worldwide  donate  $15  million  annually  to  over  2,000  organizations  (Patagonia  3,  2014).      Patagonia's   commitment   to   the   environment   extends   beyond   materials   to   include   energy   efficiency   and   transparency.   Patagonia   audited   their   facilities   resulting   in   installing   energy   efficient   lighting   and   installing  skylights  and  advanced  heating  and  cooling  technologies  leading  to  a  25%  increase  in  energy   savings   (Lutz,   2011).   In   2005   Patagonia   installed   its   first   solar   PV   system   on   a   facility   at   its   offices   in   Ventura.      In   order   to   increase   accountability,   Chouinard   stresses   transparency   throughout   its   supply   chain   to   include   social   standards.   As   a   way   to   create   greater   consumer   confidence   in   their   sustainability

and  social  claims,  Patagonia  publishes  its  annual  factory  list  so  that  NGOs,  customers  and  governments   can  easily  monitor  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  its  garments.        Patagonia's   mission   is   rooted   in   creating   apparel   with   limited   environmental   impacts.   Chouinard   understands   that   in   order   to   be   successful,   Patagonia   must   create   products   that   are   well   made   and   sustainable.   Chouinard   embeds   sustainability   throughout   the   entire   process,   from   the   materials   used,   the   energy   efficiency   of   Patagonia   facilities,   employee   engagement   to   consumer   consumption   and   disposal.   Patagonia   encourages   employees   to   suggest   environmental   initiatives.   Patagonia   has   faced   challenges  in  incorporating  sustainability  throughout  their  entire  supply  chain,  however,  each  time  the   company   made   the   decision   to   implement   processes   to   improve   their   environmental   commitments,   they  paid  off  financially.      Patagonia   demonstrates   the   role   a   retailer   can   play,   both   in   acting   as   proxy   for   consumers   and   in   influencing   other   brands.   Patagonia's   commitment   to   the   environment,   particularly   to   sustainable   cotton,  has  led  to  others  in  the  industry  following  suit.  Patagonia's  culture  of  environmental  and  social   consciousness   is   rooted   in   Chouinard's   belief   in   sustainability.   Patagonia's   success   is   rooted   in   its   founder's  core  beliefs,  quality  apparel  and  strong  marketing.  Patagonia  offers  indication  that  there  exists   a  business  case  for  sustainable  fashion.       

6.3  Marks  &  Spencer  
Marks  &  Spencer  (M&S)  is  a  UK  based  retailer  of  own-brand  clothing,  home  products  and  quality  food   with   1253   stores   worldwide   serving   over   33.6   million   customers   in   the   UK.      M&S   has   embedded   sustainability  directly  into  their  core  mission  and  makes  claims  of  being  the  most  sustainable  retailer.  To   address   environmental   and   social   concerns,   M&S   has   partnered   with   NGOs   like   WWF,   Oxfam   and   UNICEF   to   create   programs   and   initiatives   addressing   sustainability   throughout   their   supply   chain.     In2007,  M&S  launched  Plan  A,  the  retailer's  sustainability  program  with  the  help  of  WWF.  The  program   addresses   both   social   and   environmental   concerns   throughout   the   supply   chain   of   clothing,   home   products  and  food.    Plan  A  incorporates  four  main  pillars;  Inspiration,  Intouch,  Integrity  and  Innovation.   Each  is  used  to  engage  with  consumers  and  suppliers  on  sustainability.  Since  its  2007  launch,  M&S  has   improved   energy   efficiency   by   25%,   cut   waste   by   34%,   addressed   the   sustainability   of   raw   materials   (such  as  cotton)  and  increased  its  work  on  ethical  trade  (M&S,  2014).

Plan  A  lists  100  commitments  to  address  material  impacts  generated  throughout  their  supply  chain.  In   2013,   M&S   achieved   9   of   its   commitments,   is   on   target   for   79   and   behind/not   started   on   12   commitments.  One  of  their  most  ambitious  initiatives  is  to  have  a  sustainability  credential  attached  to   50%  of  its  products  by  2015,  and  to  100%  of  its  products  by  2020.  Among  the  sustainability  credentials  is   sustainable   cotton   sourcing,   green   factory   programs   and   recycling   partnerships.   M&S   became   the   world's  largest  purchaser  of  organic  cotton  in  2010,  and  by  2013,  M&S  sourced  20%  of  its  cotton  from   sustainable  sources  including  BCI,  Fair  trade,  organic  and  recycled  (Plan  A,  2014).    In  addition,  M&S  has   incorporated  fair  sourcing  into  its  supply  chain,  and  is  pursuing  a  Factory  Ethical  Excellence  initiative  to   train   500,000   supply   chain   workers.   Training   will   include   support   for   disadvantaged   small   producers   and   education  on  worker  rights.        To   address   the   lifecycle   of   its   clothing,   M&S   partnered   with   Oxfam   to   introduce   its   `Shwopping   program'.    M&S  encourages  customers  to  bring  in  their  used  clothing  to  participating  M&S  stores,  where   it   will   be   donated   to   UNICEF   to   resell   online,   in   their   stores   or   in   international   markets   (M&S,   2014).     What   is   not   sold   will   be   recycled,   with   high-end   materials   made   into   new   fabrics   and   low   quality   materials   used   for   stuffing.   Since   initiating   the   `Shwopping'   program,   over   7.8   million   garments,   at   an   estimated  Â£5.5  million  have  been  donated  to  Oxfam.      M&S  functions  as  a  proxy  for  consumers  by  advocating  for  sustainability  and  equality  to  its  customers   and  other  organizations.    M&S  partnered  with  UNICEF  in  2013  to  create  a  hanger-recycling  program.  The   hanger   recycling   program   encourages   consumers   to   leave   their   hangers   at   the   till   when   they   pay,   allowing  M&S  to  recycle  and  reuse  the  hangers,  saving  the  company  money.    In  2013,  M&S  recycled  152   million  hangers,  saving  15,000  tonnes  of  CO2,  and  donated  57p  for  reach  box  of  hangers  recycled  M&S   2,   2014).   M&S   has   set   a   target   to   recycle   200   million   hangers   each   year,   donating   a   minimum   of   Â£650,000 per  year  for  the  next  three  years  to  UNICEF.    M&S  and  UNICEF  are  directing  the  money  to  a   pilot   program   in   Bangladesh,   working   in   communities   to   improve   health   care,   access   to   water   and   ensuring   education   (M&S   2,   2014).   In   addition,   M&S   partnered   with   UNICEF   UK   ambassador   and   celebrity  Cat  Deeley  to  promote  their  hanger-recycling  program  and  engage  with  UK  consumers.        M&S'   success   as   a   sustainable   retailer   extends   beyond   fashion   to   its   food   and   home   products   line.   M&S   has   made   it   their   mission   to   set   a   standard   for   sustainable   and   ethical   sourcing.   As   a   result   of   their

ambitious  Plan  A,  M&S  has  received  over  100  sustainability  awards  and  is  recognized  as  a  sustainability   leader  (M&S,  2014).  

6.4  Conclusion  
   Patagonia   and   M&S   demonstrate   the   influence   retailers   can   have   on   other   industry   players   and   on   their   customers.  Due  to  their  market  success  as  sustainable  retailers,  Patagonia  and  M&S  are  in  a  position  to   be   influential   for   other   private   sector   players.   Both   Patagonia   and   M&S   have   high   level   management   invested  in  their  sustainable  initiatives  to  make  sure  environmental  sustainability  is  at  the  core  of  their   business   practices.      Both   M&S   and   Patagonia   address   supply   chain   issues,   and   work   toward   providing   greater  transparency  throughout  their  supply  chain.  Both  Patagonia  and  M&S  have  acted  as  proxies  for   consumers  by  providing  clothing  that  is  sustainable.    Additionally  they  have  acted  as  innovators  in  their   industry   to   encourage   other   retailers   to   follow   suit.   Patagonia   was   the   first   apparel   retailer   to   introduce   Synchilla   to   their   line   and   incorporate   100%   organic   cotton   into   their   supply   chain,   establishing   an   organic   cotton   industry   to   act   as   a   model   for   companies   like   NIKE,   H&M   and   Walmart      (Gardiner,   2011).     In   addition,   Patagonia   uses   consumers   facing   labels,   and   currently   sources   Fair   Trade   Certified   cotton   and  it  produces  a  line  of  clothing  in  Fair  Trade  Certified  factories.        In   order   to   address   sustainability   issues   and   instill   greater   awareness   and   trust   in   their   sustainability   claims,   M&S   and   Patagonia   have   partnered   with   NGOs   like   BCI   to   source   better   cotton.      M&S   and   Patagonia   understand   the   value   of   marketing   their   sustainability   issues   to   their   consumers.   M&S   has   strategically   partnered   with   NGOs   and   celebrities   to   engage   with   their   consumers   on   aspects   of   sustainability.   Patagonia   has   launched   campaigns   encouraging   their   customers   to   fix   their   old   Patagonia   gear  rather  than  buying  new  gear.    By  partnering  with  NGOs  to  incorporate  VIs  that  are  well  marketed   and  promoted,  Patagonia  and  M&S  are  well  positioned  to  influence  both  producers  and  consumers.      Retailers   have   the   unique   opportunity   to   act   as   proxy   for   their   consumers,   Patagonia   and   M&S   demonstrate  that  incorporating  sustainability  into  core  business  actions  can  be  financially  beneficial  for   a  company.    By  incorporating  sustainability  into  their  supply  chains,  Patagonia  and  M&S  are  positioned   to  act  on  behalf  of  their  consumers  to  provide  sustainability  options  and  anticipate  future  trends  (Webb,   2004).    M&S  and  Patagonia  have  integrated  sustainability  into  the  core  of  their  businesses,  advocating   for  greater  transparency  and  accountability  throughout  their  supply  chains.  In  doing  so,  both  are  placing   greater  pressure  on  retailers  to  follow  suit.

Historically,  the  fashion  industry  has  acted  on  the  spectrum  of  weak  sustainability  with  greater  emphasis   placed  on  economic  performance.  A  greater  acceptance  and  acknowledgement  of  the  negative  impacts   the   industry   has   on   both   society   and   the   environment   can   aid   in   shifting   away   from   the   current   conventional   model   (Giddings,   Hopwood   &   O'Brian,   2002).   Literature   demonstrates   that   there   are   considerable  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  generated  throughout  the  fashion  supply  chain,   in  the  production  of  textiles,  the  manufacturing  of  garments  and  in  the  consumer  and  disposal  phase.      The  traditional  fashion  industry  supply  chain  emphasizes  economic  gain  and  transactional  relationships   where  success  is  placed  on  economic  drivers  and  performances.  The  fashion  industry  has  benefited  from   the   globalized   and   fragmented   supply   chain,   allowing   brands   to   avert   direct   responsibility   through   subcontracting   their   manufacturing   abroad.   Fast   fashion   is   the   latest   manifestation   of   the   fashion   model,   accelerating   the   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   of   the   industry.   However,   due   to   increasing  consumer  awareness  through  media  coverage  and  NGO  campaigns,  retailers  are  increasingly   being  held  accountable  for  garments  throughout  the  entire  production  lifecycle.    As  a  result,  sustainable   fashion   is   becoming   an   increasingly   popular   topic,   with   most   retailers   releasing   yearly   CSR   reports   tracking  their  environmental  and  social  progress.      While  globalization  has  led  to  a  diversification  of  the  fashion  industry,  it  also  allows  for  consumers  to  be   more   engaged   with   the   brands   they   buy,   including   understanding   their   supply   chains.   NGOs   can   use   the   increase   in   communication   to   their   advantage   by   using   social   media   to   educate   consumers   on   the   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.   Following   the   collapse   of   Rana   Plaza   in   2013,   pictures   of   the   tragic   collapse   made   their   way   around   the   world.   NGO   and   media   campaigns   engaged   with   and   educated   consumers   on   the   impacts   of   the   industry.   In   response,   NGO   campaigns   were   able   to   place   increased   pressure  on  companies  to  respond  and  address  social  concerns  where  their  garments  were  made.        There  exists  clear  academic  recognition  on  the  need  to  integrate  the  economy,  society  and  environment   to  create  a  sustainable  fashion  industry,  yet  there  exists  little  guidance  on  how  this  can  be  achieved  in   theory   and   practice   (Giddings,   Hopwood   &   O'Brian,   2002).      As   the   study   demonstrates,   incorporating   sustainability   into   the   supply   chain   and   a   slowing   down   of   production   can   function   to   create   tangible

benefits  for  the  brands  including  safer  and  cleaner  facilities,  reduced  environmental  and  health  risks  and   an   improvement   in   product   quality   (Giddings,   Hopwood   &   O'Brian,   2002).   In   addition,   sustainable   initiatives   can   create   positive   PR   for   brands.   For   example,   in   2011   H&M   launched   its   Conscious   Collection   integrating   organic   cotton,   recycled   polyester   and   tencel.   H&M   claims   to   be   a   leader   in   sustainable   fashion   and   uses   their   actions   to   generate   PR.   Adopting   sustainability   also   creates   competitive  advantage  for  firms  to  move  ahead  of  regulations  and  shows  a  firms  due  diligence.        As   demonstrated   in   Chapter   4,   CSR   reports   are   the   industry   norm,   with   reports   becoming   more   detailed   each  year.  Leading  retailers  are  reporting  on  sustainability,  with  water,  waste,  CO2  and  energy  listed  as   high   priority.   Despite   the   lack   of   a   clear   industry   standard   and   cohesive   monitoring,   trends   in   sustainability  have  emerged  in  the  fashion  industry.  Across  the  sector,  the  material  sourcing  phase  was   highlighted  as  contributing  the  greatest  environmental  impacts.  Each  of  the  sample  set  of  retailers  has   adopted  measures  to  address  the  issues  presented  through  textile  production,  specifically  in  regards  to   cotton.   Furthermore,   retailers   highlighted   the   impacts   generated   in   the   consumer   phase.   To   address   this,  retailers  have  begun  to  adopt  take-back  programs  in  order  to  recycle  or  reuse  used  garments.       

7.2  Harmonizing  Voluntary  Initiatives  
Literature   emphasizes   the   shortcomings   of   existing   voluntary   initiatives   in   the   fashion   industry   due   to   their   lack   of   cohesiveness   and   lack   of   consumer   recognition.   Regulations/laws   can   be   difficult   to   implement   at   an   international   level   due   to   the   long   supply   chain   of   fashion,   often   traversing   multiple   borders   in   its   manufacturing   phase.      Through   VIs   or   certification   schemes,   retailers   can   demand   transparency  from  their  suppliers  throughout  their  supply  chains  to  ensure  sustainability  is  embedded   throughout   the   entire   life   cycle   of   a   garment.   A   clear   V.I.   with   an   embedded   certification   model   can   communicate   to   consumers   through   a   trusted   labeling   scheme.   However,   there   currently   does   not   exist   a   comprehensive   scheme   for   supplier   factories   to   adopt,   one   that   addresses   the   entire   lifecycle   and   scope  of  fashion.        There   exist   many   VIs   for   the   fashion   industry,   many   with   overlap   in   their   content   and   standards.   However,  these  VIs  often  have  different  standards  of  reporting  and  monitoring,  which  can  act  in  conflict   with  each  other  (Newitt,  2013).    While  there  is  growing  awareness  among  retailers  and  NGOs  alike  on   the   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry,   this   has   yet   to   lead   to   a   consensus   around   CSR   activities   and   objectives  for  the  fashion  industry.  Supplier  factories  often  complain  of  the  multitude  of  standards  and

codes,   which   can   lead   to   audit   fatigue   and   high   costs,   specifically   when   codes   overlap   in   content   but   differ   in   reporting   mechanisms   (Newitt,   2013).   The   contradictory   monitoring   and   reporting   of   these   standards  can  serve  to  impede  progress,  and  discourage  factory  suppliers  from  complying  due  to  cost  or   lack  of  time.        Due   to   the   fashion   industry's   global   reach,   spanning   many   jurisdictions,   regulations   are   difficult   to   implement,   monitor   and   enforce   (Gam,   2007).   Strict   voluntary   initiatives   that   focus   on   raising   consumer   awareness,   thereby   creating   greater   demand   for   eco   fashion   have   greater   potential   to   lead   to   reform   within  the  fashion  industry.  To  do  so,  voluntary  initiatives  must  include  clear  labeling  of  `eco'  products   and   designer   input,   and   include   strict   guidelines   for   company   and   designer   standards.   Standards   must   take   the   entire   life   cycle   of   a   garment   into   consideration.   Furthermore,   a   voluntary   initiative   must     address   social   and   ethical   concerns   generated   throughout   the   supply   chain.   A   comprehensive   VI   must   include   both   strict   environmental   and   social   standards.      Fashion   can   apply   lessons   from   the   fair   trade   coffee  industry  by  appealing  to  consumers  based  on  ethics  and  environmental  responsibility  through  a   trusted   consumer-facing   label.   Fair   trade   was   successful,   in   part,   due   to   their   recognizable   label.   Fair   trade   type   certifications   are   most   often   business   to   consumer   facing   and   provide   consumers   with   the   environmental   and   social   information   on   the   benefits   of   purchasing   fair   trade.   Fair   trade   certification   models  have  capitalized  on  large  retailer  involvement,  allowing  certifications  to  become  mainstreamed   and  therefore  more  accessible  for  consumers.        There   continues   to   be   a   lack   of   consumer   awareness   regarding   the   negative   environmental   and   social   impacts   of   the   clothing   industry.   With   the   shift   towards   fast   fashion   these   environmental   and   social   impacts   have   been   exaggerated.   While   recycling   and   the   acceptance   of   organic   have   become   more   mainstreamed   in   the   food   industry,   this   has   yet   to   be   translated   to   the   fashion/apparel   sector.   Consumer   awareness   and   education   campaigns   are   key   to   success   of   a   comprehensive   V.I.   Education   on   the   negative   impacts   on   both   producers   and   the   planet   generated   during   the   manufacturing   phase   is   needed,   in   addition   to   placing   onus   on   consumers   to   properly   care   for   clothing   and   dispose   of   garments   properly.  Brands  like  H&M  are  attempting  to  educate  consumers  through  their  responsible  care  labels,   but  this  has  yet  to  extend  to  their  lifecycle  assessments.  H&M  continues  to  make  garments  made  quickly   and  affordably,  garments  that  are  designed  to  be  worn  for  a  season  and  discarded.  Sustainability  must   be   thought   of   throughout   the   entire   supply   chain,   by   creating   clothing   made   environmentally   and   social   responsible,  and  designed  to  last.

   Research  demonstrates  that  `green'  methods  adopted  for  the  manufacturing  of  cotton  can  prove  to  be   beneficial  for  the  apparel  industry,  consumers  and  the  environment  alike  (Moore,  2004).  A  sustainable   supply   chain   of   organic   cotton   can   lead   to   greater   stability   for   producers   and   manufacturers   alike   leading  to  improvements  in  social  and  environmental  standards.  BCI  is  attempting  to  create  that  stable   cotton   supply   chain   and   has   partnered   with   many   large   retailers   including   H&M,   NIKE,   Adidas   and   Inditex.  However,  BCI  offers  only  one  part  of  the  solution  and  is  not  consumer  facing.        Creating   a   straightforward   labeling   process,   one   that   adheres   to   a   comprehensive   voluntary   initiative,   will   help   to   inform   consumers   on   how   to   consume   more   sustainable   products.   According   to   Gam   (2007)   consumers   are   willing   to   purchase   `green'   (sustainable)   products,   but   are   often   confused   by   labels.   A   number  of  consumers  appear  to  find  product  labels  hard  to  understand.  Research  has  found  that  there   are   consumers   who   will   buy   lower   quality   green   products   in   comparison   to   alternative   products,   but   only   when   environmental   information   is   clearly   stated   on   labels   (D'Souza   et   al.,   2006).   Price   sensitive   eco   consumers,   who   claim   to   always   read   labels,   expressed   that   their   decision   to   purchase   `eco'   products   was   contingent   on   sufficient   and   straightforward   information   displayed   on   product   labels   (D'Souza  et  al.,  2006).     Reforming  the  fashion  industry,  to  improve  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  generated  throughout   the  supply  chain,  is  a  critical  element  in  order  to  create  a  more  sustainable  fashion  industry  (Kadolph,   2010).   The   textile   industry   has   a   past   deeply   rooted   in   migration;   the   determining   factor   of   this   migration  is  lower  cost  of  production.  As  a  result,  the  industry  has  moved  to  where  regulations  are  less   stringent  and  therefore  provides  no  incentive  for  facilities  in  the  Global  South  to  encourage  innovative   alternatives   to   toxic   dyes.   Regulation   alone   will   not   serve   to   effectively   prohibit   the   use   of   toxic   chemicals,   but   a   comprehensive   voluntary   initiative   addressing   the   entire   life   cycle   of   garments   that   works  in  conjunction  with  environmental  and  ethical  regulations  will  have  a  greater  potential  to  lead  to   reform   within   the   fashion   industry.   With   increased   media   attention   and   NGO   campaigns   working   to   engage  and  inform  consumers  to  demand  sustainable  clothing,  major  retailers  will  find  it  best  for  their   brands  to  adhere  to  the  new  trends  (Gam,  2007).  Campaigns  by  organizations  such  as  Greenpeace  with   the   Detox   Challenge   are   vital   in   bridging   the   gap   between   policy   and   science.   These   campaigns   function   to   inform   consumers   who   can   then   place   greater   demand   on   industry   leaders   to   sign   on   to   voluntary   initiatives  and  place  pressure  on  policy  officials  to  create  effective  regulation  and  enforcement  tools.

The  increase  in  green  purchasing  by  industry  leaders  like  Patagonia  and  M&S  demonstrates  the  demand   for   green   products   and   services.   However,   while   `green   purchasing'   is   on   the   rise,   fast   fashion   continues   to   dominate   sales.   Consumers   lack   awareness   on   the   negative   health   and   environmental   impacts   of   their  clothing  and  therefore  are  hesitant  to  make  the  switch  to  purchasing  sustainable  fashion.  Price  and   quality   play   a   primary   role   in   purchasing   of   eco   garments.   A   study   by   Nakano   (2001)   found   that   consumers   are   not   willing   to   pay   over   10%   more   for   sustainable   and   that   consumers   associate   purchasing  `green'  products  with  saving  money.  Alternatively,  a  study  by  Bhaduri  et  al.  (2011)  found  that   there  exists  a  lack  of  trust  in  business  and  retailer  claims  of  sustainability;  consumers  do  not  want  to  fall   victim  to  `green  washing'  schemes.  Furthermore,  consumers  find  labeling  unclear  and  inconsistent.     

7.3  Potential  Application  of  Research  
Several  industry  recommendations  can  be  drawn  from  this  study's  analysis.  First,  the  study  draws  on  the   lack  of  cohesive  tracking  and  monitoring  standards  throughout  the  fashion  industry.    According  to  the   analysis,  retailers  generally  report  on  sustainability  initiatives,  but  have  yet  to  set  an  industry  standard,   making   it   difficult   to   track   overall   improvements   in   the   industry   in   regards   to   water,   waste,   CO2   and   energy.   There   is   a   pressing   need   to   develop   a   cohesive   and   holistic   monitoring   tool   for   the   fashion   industry  in  order  to  develop  greater  transparency  and  consumer  confidence.  A  holistic  monitoring  tool   must  also  include  social  standards.      Second,   fair   trade-type   certification   schemes   offer   a   starting   point   to   address   retailer   engagement   in   sustainability.   As   identified   throughout   the   report,   voluntary   initiatives   play   a   key   role   in   policy   framework  as  they  can  function  to  strengthen  regulation.  Due  to  the  multi-jurisdictional  aspect  of  the   fashion  industry,  regulation  can  be  difficult  to  uphold  and  monitor.    Fair  trade  type  certification  schemes   rely   on   consumer   facing   labels   and   consumer   education   and   awareness   through   retailers   who   act   as   proxies  for  consumers.  Fair  trade-type  certification  addresses  both  social  and  environmental  concerns,   and   have   looked   to   mainstream   their   movements   by   partnering   with   major   retailers.   The   fashion   industry   can   adopt   lessons   from   fair   trade   by   adopting   a   standard   that   addresses   both   environmental   and   social   standards.   Like   the   fair   trade   label,   a   label   used   in   the   fashion   industry   must   be   consumer   facing   in   order   to   generate   awareness   and   trust.   Retailers   can   play   a   key   role   in   acting   as   proxies   for   consumers  by  adhering  to  a  singular  code  that  allows  for  standardized  reporting  methods.

Thirdly,  by  the  fashion  industry  investing  and  adopting  proper  monitoring  and  data  collection  tools  the   industry   can   begin   to   address   major   environmental   concerns   across   the   sector.   Future   applications   of   this  research  can  help  companies  carry  out  a  risk  assessment  of  their  business  models  and  supply  chains;   put   together   a   sustainability   roadmap   covering   the   full   product/service   lifecycle;   and   ensure   they   understand  the  social  and  environmental  context  in  which  their  products  and  services  are  used.  As  the   fashion  industry  and  consumer  demands  shift  towards  more  sustainable  practices  companies  will  need   to  start  developing  the  skills  they  will  need  to  be  successful  in  the  future.    The  industry  will  need  climate   change   experts,   water   policy   specialists,  and   innovators   with   skills   in   design   for   disassembly   and   closed- loop  manufacturing  and  many  more.      Finally,   with   greater   consumer   and   industry   awareness   regarding   sustainable   practices   for   the   fashion   industry  through  the  creation  of  a  comprehensive  and  easily  understood  voluntary  initiative,  a  greater   sense  of  consumer  confidence  in  sustainable  apparel  will  be  created.  A  consumer  facing  label,  adopted   and   implemented   by   retailers,   with   adequate   information   could   lead   to   greater   purchasing   of   sustainable  fashion  alternatives  by  conscious  consumers.       

7.4  Further  Investigation  
Eco  fashion  is  a  fast  growing  trend  among  researchers  and  scientists.  In  2013  the  Journal  of  Corporate   Citizenship   released   a   special   issue   on   sustainable   fashion.   Large   retail   brands   such   as   NIKE,   Adidas,   Inditex,   Gildan   and   H&M   have   begun   to   release   corporate   sustainability   reports   and   a   number   of   widely   recognized   NGOs   (World   Wildlife   Fund   and   Greenpeace)   have   launched   campaigns   and   reports   addressing   the   negative   environmental   impacts   of   the   fashion   industry.   However,   as   it   is   still   an   emerging  topic,  many  issues  and  questions  remain.      Furthermore,   research   must   look   to   address   both   social   and   environmental   concerns   through   one   initiative   for   the   fashion   industry.   While   this   paper   focused   primarily   on   the   environmental   impacts   generated  by  the  fashion  industry,  a  comprehensive  VI  for  the  fashion  industry  must  also  include  clear   commitments  and  guidelines  to  address  the  social  impacts  of  apparel  production.    Just  as  fair  trade-type   coffee  certifications  aim  to  address  both  the  social  and  environmental  concerns,  so  too  must  a  VI  for  the   fashion  industry.

Past  research  has  assessed  voluntary  initiatives  in  the  fashion  industry  on  an  individual  basis.  Research   has   yet   to   be   compiled   in   a   comparative   sense   that   encompasses   the   breadth   of   initiatives   that   exist.   This   comparative   analysis   provides   a   starting   point   for   creating   a   new   holistic   voluntary   initiative   for   the   fashion   industry.   Future   researchers   can   take   the   information   gathered   on   consumer   behaviour   and   eco   awareness   combined   with   designer   and   retailer   input   to   create   an   initiative   that   includes   the   full   life   cycle  of  a  garment  from  agricultural  phase  right  to  post  consumption.        Further   research   could   be   completed   on   the   impact   of   clear   labeling   schemes   directed   at   consumers.   The   development   of   a   clearly   labeled   voluntary   initiative   for   fashion,   such   as   that   of   fair   trade,   could   lead  to  greater  consumer  awareness  and  greater  purchasing  of  sustainable  fashion.    Further  studies  are   needed  to  determine  its  impact  on  consumer  behaviour.      This  research  looked  to  large  fast  fashion  retailers  with  a  presence  in  Canada.  Future  research  could  look   to  the  influence  that  name  designers,  luxury  designers  and  small  designers  and  retailers  could  have  on   impacting  sustainability  in  the  fashion  industry.      Sustainable   fashion   must   concentrate   on   materials-based   or   technical   innovations   and   social   change,   everything  from  championing  lower  impact  fiber  types  to  fairer  employment  methods  to  more  efficient   processing   techniques.  Designers   are   thought   to   influence   an   estimated   80   percent   of   the   environmental   impact   of   a   product   and   so   designers   must   be   part   of   the   solution.   The   study   assessed   larger  retailers  and  their  CSR  models,  however,  due  to  the  scope  did  not  look  at  the  role  name  designers   and   smaller   retailers   can   play   in   addressing   sustainability.   The   demands   driven   from   smaller   retailers   may  present  results  and  levels  of  engagement  as  they  relate  to  CSR.  Future  research  needs  to  assess  to   what   extent   designers   can   be   involved   throughout   the   process.   Research   can   look   to   how   to   better   incorporate   sustainability   standards   into   academic   institutions   housing   fashion   programs.   It   is   integral   that  emerging  designers  be  knowledgeable  not  only  of  the  sustainable  options,  but  also  of  the  negative   impacts  of  conventional  clothing  practices.        In   general,   CSR   is   a   rising   issue   across   the   fashion   retail   sector;   the   suggestion   made   here   is   that   to   address   the   sustainability   dimensions   of   fashion   there   must   first   be   development   of   a   comprehensive   standard   to   allow   measurement   and   reporting   on   the   environmental   and   social   impacts      across   the   supply  chain  that  would  enhance  the  ability  of  all  actors  to  track  improvements  and  industry  trends
