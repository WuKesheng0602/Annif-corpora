CATALYZING THE IN-BETWEEN: Mediating Architecture, Landscape & Infrastructure Hannah Hyder Master of Architecture 2015 Architecture Program, Ryerson University

Abstract
Dominated by motion, time, and event, the contemporary American metropolis has evolved into a loose agglomerated field, where residual space rules over built form (Lerup, 2000). Theorized as Dross by Lars Lerup, these interstitial residual territories disrupt connectivity and urban cohesion (Lerup, 2000). They emerge as the byproduct of infrastructure where processes accommodating flows are more valued than physical place-generating public domain. Architecture has become increasingly marginalized and is no longer the building block as traditionally understood in Aldo Rossi's terms (Rossi, 1984). the degraded By redesigning a specific site within

downtown core of Houston Texas, this thesis

contends that Architecture can seek new opportunities for urban cohesion when intersected with Landscape Urbanism and urban infrastructure. This synthesis has the potential to

generate a public realm through strategies that can catalyze novel relationships and connections between territories that are separated by infrastructural systems. By mediating between architecture, landscape and infrastructure, the subsequent site will be restored and become a catalyst for further socioeconomic developments.

CHAPTER 1 : formless city: architecture's nemesis

1

1.1 Introduction

In the past few decades, the concept of the city has changed fundamentally. Whereas it was once a defined hierarchy within an urban area, it is now a conglomeration of discrete areas and urban voids (Mayne & Allen, city 2011). is or Driven a by rapid

urbanization, metropolis,

the

now

polycentric (city

of many cities) that yet needs a morphological definition.

This

spatial

restructuring

has

been

largely

influenced by forces of capitalism and globalization under both private and governmental influence. The flux of human and financial capital has altered the spatial form of cities, and their relationship with architecture (Mayne & Allen, 2011). The meaning of Architecture has been reduced to a mere commodity, a reflection of economic and status quo forces.

The

effects

of

urbanization

on

a

city's

infrastructure, spatial form and interconnectivity is a key concern. This issue is reinforced by future global migratory trends which suggest that by 2050, 70% of the world's population will be living in cities (UN DESA, 2014). It is crucial to

2

understand how rapid urbanization will shape the built environment. What will the implications of this urbanization be on resources, environment, infrastructure, urbanism, and overall spatial

form? What is the role of architecture in the changing dynamics of cities?

Given this broad global perspective, while some metropolitan cities have managed to consolidate rapid urbanization through vertical growth, others have experienced further horizontal expansion.

American cities in particular have a history of horizontal sprawl, and treating urban land as a commodity. The problems of a suburban metropolis are extreme as urbanization of its physical

landscape has created issues of an infrastructural scale (Berger, 2006). Dominated by speed, free enterprise and residential privacy, the suburban metropolis is a formless city.

Discontinuity, fragmentation, large tracts of waste lands, environmental degradation, and irregular and chaotic structures - have rendered the suburban metropolis formless (Berger, 2006). This lack of spatial definition has altered the traditional

relationship of architecture to the city. Concrete architectural concepts such as Form, Boundary and

3

Symbolism have

diminished in importance in the

face of networks and flows that favour convenience and speed (Seewang, 2013). Buildings are largely

conditioned by the context of their infrastructure, by movements and flows. The post-WWII abandonment of the traditional urban grid led to the development of a spine-like system of freeways and cul-de-

sacs; this has generated a highly private urbanism (Pope, 2011).

In

the

late

20th

century,

the

trend

toward

horizontal sprawl was caused by

the industrial

city. At present, horizontal sprawl is occurring as a result of debilitated city centers caused by intersecting infrastructural systems and market driven practices. While the global trend in the 21st century has been toward dense central cores, many American cities find themselves trapped in 20th-century development patterns of sprawl.

Certain

trends

have

encapsulated

the

need

to

rehabilitate American central cores, which are now plagued with systematic infrastructural problems caused by the destruction of inner cities in the 20th century. Changing demographics such as the aging populations of baby boomers, young professionals, and immigrant populations demand a new urbanism.

4

The failure of ecological systems

that

at times

results in problems such as flooding, has been caused by urbanization of watersheds. We must

search for alternatives. Throughout the world, the rehabilitation of central city cores has often been followed by urban regeneration initiatives such as waterfront revitalizations. However, the infrastructural conditions of the American central urban core does not allow for straightforward

revitalization.

How can Architecture create a sense of place in the American suburban metropolis given the spatial conditions created by complex

infrastructural

systems in the central core?

One point of departure is to use void spaces usually dismissed as urban waste, as catalysts for achieving interconnectivity through a holistic design approach. Theorized as Dross by Lars Lerup, these large tracts of waste lands and urban voids have emerged from the and through process of de-industrialization real estate development

practices (Lerup, 2000). However, reclaiming these landscapes is complicated due to the large scale and infrastructural problems associated with these sites (Berger, 2006).

5

In

the

field

of

design,

the

concept

of

infrastructure has become increasingly relevant by which the spatial form of contemporary cities can

be better understood (Seewang, 2013). By definition infrastructure can be understood as systems, works and networks upon which the human inhabitation is reliant on (Carleson, 2013). As a means to address the issues of interconnectivity between built form and open space, the notion of infrastructure has expanded over the years to include the natural ecological systems along with gray infrastructures.

The need to address the issue of urban waste by recognizing the impact of infrastructure on the built environment is becoming a territory for

design. As the lifeblood of cities, infrastructure is by not only the primary but area its for investment as an

This thesis proposes to create a specific unified place within the formless suburban metropolis of Houston Texas, where market driven growth in the absence of zoning and planning governance, have resulted in countless Dross space and complex

spatial conditions. By identifying a potential site as a catalyst in the degraded historic downtown core, this thesis aims to create a collective sense of place by using cultural, institutional and natural assets for revitalizing Dross, using

has eroded in the contemporary city (Fig 3). The distributed and uses of the contemporary metropolis have

replaced the value of

1.3 Architecture in Extreme Urbanization

Since the birth of modern metropolis in the 19th century, architects have taken several positions to rethink and enhance the discipline's engagement with the formless city.
Fig 7. 19th Century metropolis, London. Exponential growth, congestion and inhabitable living conditions were few problems of the industrial city.

In City Catalyst: Architecture in the Age of Extreme Urbanisation, Alexander Eisenschmidt states architects embraced have the either resisted city or as a that

These attitudes of radically embracing or resisting the contemporary city have developed in the

last two centuries with the exponential growth of cities. Beginning with the industrial cities of Fig 8 (b). 19th century renovation of Paris, Paris, 1853-1870

technological advancements, communication networks and new modes of production gave birth to the modern metropolis (Fig 7). New ways of thinking were needed to understand the city as previous forms of problems of the

design could not respond to the new urban culture and industrial city

(Eisenschmidt, 2012). Among others, Ebenezer Howard's

Garden City movement (Fig 8. a) and Georges-EugÃ¨ne Haussmann's renovation for Paris (Fig 8. b) were a few design concepts that emerged as radical for embracing the problems of the congested industrial city.

Towards the 20th century post-war years, the effects of urbanization driven by forces of modernization altered the shape of cities towards formlessness (Fig 9). Technological advancements such as the automobile

and freeway systems led to increased fragmentation, residential privacy and unprecedented horizontal expansion.

Architects became increasingly critical of the contemporary city as formlessness challenged its significance and its privileged status as an urban form-maker in the city. This led to two extreme positions, "either resisting the current change or radicalising it" (Eisenschmidt, 2012, p.19). Both these stances aimed to use architecture to bring order to the increasingly disordered environment of the formless city.

Fig. 9. Cedric Price - depicted formless and unbounded quality of the contemporary city

16

Some Architects resisted change by returning to history as a model for ordering cities. Among others, the work of Aldo Rossi was influential in presenting the city as an Urban Artifact, and as a critique of Modernism which emphasized function over various qualities of space (Eisenschmidt, 2012).

Rossi uses Palazzo della Ragione as an example of an Urban Artifact built in medieval times. He argues that if this building were constructed today, it would not have the same value and impact on the urban fabric as it had at the time. Its value arises from its multiple uses over the years. It has acquired permanence and became a focal point around which the city structured over the centuries (Fig 10 a,b).

This architectural form generated a sense of space, and over time came to define the character of the city itself. For this reason, the city is a place, a locus of collective memory, and a

cultural artifact (Rossi, 1984).

Ludwig Hilberseimer - The High-Rise City

On the other side of the spectrum, architects radically embraced the contemporary city

driven by post WWII conditions. These included new technologies, production methods and the mass culture of consumption (Eisenschmidt, 2012).
Fig 12 (a). The vision for high density living

The High rise City was conceived with the technologies of its time, and within that time's social and economic context. It

Learning From Las Vegas

In

their 1972 publication, Learning from Denise Scott

Las Vegas , Robert Venturi and

Brown advocated for approaching the American post WWII city on its own terms. By engaging with the existing conditions, architects

can overcome their fear of chaos instilled by Modernism's revolutionary, puristic and utopian predilection for changing existing environments. It is more revolutionary for is a defined space within the
suburban metropolis. Fig 15. The Las Vegas strip,

Corbusier's suggestion in the 1920's to tear down Paris and begin again. (Venturi & Brown, 1977).

In the auto-centric city of Las Vegas, the traditional constructs of urban space as an environment defined by boundaries and urban

form was revised. The contemporary landscape of sprawl, driven by post-WWII urbanization, had produced a special quality of place. Exemplified through the Las Vegas Strip (Fig 15), the chaotic and openness of the strip is significant to Las Vegas, just as an

22

enclosed urban space like a piazza is to Rome (Venturi & Brown, 1977). The Las Vegas as

strip is defined by symbols in space such

signage, ornaments, and by the monumentality
Fig 17. Building as a Duck, buildings are symbols themselves

of its casinos, rather than by form (Fig 16). The signage and symbols clearly communicate their buildings' functions. Unlike Modern buildings which did not communicate anything, Las Vegas was a place well defined by

"intensified communication along the highway, where "If you take the sign away there is no place." (Venturi & Brown, 1977, p.18).
Fig 18 (a). Big sign, little building.

Architecture has a limited role in defining the city as "spatial relationships are defined by symbols", rather than architectural form (Venturi & Brown, 1977, p.13). Buildings can be classified as either a Duck or a Decorated Shed (Fig a,b) in terms of how they

communicate with their context (Venturi & Brown, 1977). Most post-war American cities like Las Vegas consist of buildings of the

of

architecture expressed information to the public through symbolism- for instance, Greek

23

and Roman temples or Egyptian hieroglyph and mosaics. Buildings throughout history have expressed communication by being signs as well. Therefore, symbolism has always been an essential element of architecture throughout history until the 20th century (Becker, 2005). By doing so, buildings can engage with their context by using iconography to communicate meaning. Symbolism should return as one of the functions of Architecture (Venturi &

Brown, 1977).

24

1.5 Summary

By returning to symbolism as an essential component of architectural form, the spatial relationship space can be between built form and open

communication. This is especially relevant in the context of the formless city where buildings play a smaller role in defining

spatial relationships.

A symbolic

a signifying role for creating value and a place of character through meaningful

expression. By doing so, Architecture can potentially renew its engagement with the city by creating spatial definition that

has been deconstructed by infrastructural systems.

2.1 Formless Houston

In his publication After the City, architect and urban theorist Lars Lerup attempts to redefine the diminishing role of Architecture in the auto-centric metropolis of Houston, Texas where "The metropolis has replaced the city, and as a consequence architecture as a static enterprise has been displaced by architecture as a form of software" (Lerup, 2000, p.22).
Fig 19. American cities are sprawling with no defined boundary controlling their growth.

This typical Texas city where bigger is better is understood as a means of achieving a better quality of life, is sprawling out of control. It has erased the boundary between the city, country and hinterland (Fig.19-21), appearing oceanic in its experience, with no boundaries to control (Lerup, 2000). geographic

This has contributed to the formless spatial order and the destruction of the public realm where "Space as value, as locus of events, as genius loci, is reduced to interior space, a return to the cave" (Lerup, 2000, p.58). As a city sustained by intensive networks of infrastructural systems, "it is dominated by motion, time and event" (Lerup, 2000, p.58).

Spatial disorder created by infrastructural systems has fragmented the built environment, giving rise to territories that do not contribute in creating a sense of place. Infrastructural systems such as freeways, bayous, rail lines create boundaries and connections within the metropolis, but also produce physical discontinuity by disrupting the urban fabric in various ways (Fig 28).

(c)

Fig 28. Infrastructural systems such as freeways (a), railways (b) and bayous (c) intersect the ground plane and create residual territories.

The result is in-between wasted residual spaces that do not contribute to the public realm. These in-between marginalized territories are theorized as Dross, the "ignored, undervalued, unfortunate residues of the metropolitan machine" (Lerup, 2000, p.58). Lerup explains the deformation of space into residues as being "constantly carved out in the front and abandoned behind" (Lerup, 2000, p.48). How can Architecture

renew its engagement with a city that is dominated by motion, time and event? How can it create a sense of place within the suburban metropolis of Houston that will generate public domain?.

2.2 Stim and Dross

In The Order of Things - An Archaeology of the Human Sciences, French philosopher Michel Foucault suggests that one must invent and evolve a grey anonymous language to transpose the visible into words, because "However hard one may try to say
Fig 29. Las Meninas, Diego VelÃ¡zquez, 1659

what one sees, what one sees never fully inhabits what one says" (Pedri & Petit, 2013, p.13). Foucault argues that the relationship between the language and the visible is an infinite one. By stating the obvious of what one names or (proper sees by using identifiable it suppresses other

names),

relative hidden elements from being discovered, that compose the visible image. Instead, one

must "pretend not to know", abstain from using "proper names" and (Foucault, 2012). depend on "the visible facts"

Foucault exemplifies the importance of anonymous and ambiguous language by using the Las Meninas painting as the material object. While concealing the facts about the painting, Foucault ambiguously discusses the sequential elements, the hidden

subject, representation, and the complexity of perspective lines that questions the relationship between subject and object. Upon identifying the

36

characters with their proper names, the material object transforms from a discursive space to a representation of known facts. The message that Foucault gives us through Las Meninas in regards to the use of grey anonymous language, is to challenge our perception of how we think about space. The use of an ambiguous and anonymous

language allows one to engage in the complexities of space and to transgress the boundaries imposed by proper names.

Applying the notion of grey language to a highly exaggerated formless city, Lars Lerup invents a new vocabulary of metaphors to describe the ecologies governing

By articulating the invisible complexities, Lerup summarizes the city's formless spatial conditions as being self organized. The city has its own order to it that provides reasoning for its built environment and urbanism, as opposed to being

spatial form - the Holey plane, holes being the urban voids (Lerup, 2000, p.50). Lerup claims that the urbanized surface of any city consists of Stim and Dross.

Perceiving Stims as objects and Dross as

subject,

one can understand that the relationship of built form to space is interrelated (Lerup, 2000). Cities are dynamic entities that should be understood more than the binary thinking of subject/object. It is more important to understand the city as a

series of correlating relationships than separate entities, that would inform design decisions

38

for meaningful architectural responses.

Lerup tests his hypothesis of Stim and Dross in rationalizing the fragmented plane of Houston, where the residual Dross space dominates over

form. Understanding the city through an activity surface in the downtown core and holey plane

in the suburban developments, he concludes that Dross is the byproduct of Stims (Lerup, 2000). The production of of Dross creates where the its spatial relentless

39

Downtown Activity Surface

The activity surface captures the invisible relationship of space to points of high and low intensity in time (Fig 32).It also captures the dynamic nature of the non-static plane (Lerup, 2011). Dross is understood in terms of occupying patterns of the landscape and raises questions regarding efficiency of use of space. Most residents commute daily from the suburbs to downtown for work. Based on this activity during the day, the agglomeration of office towers are considered to be Stims, surrounded by the vast underutilized landscape of Dross (Lerup, 2011).

The agglomeration of office towers (which creates a Megashape in Lerup's metaphorical terms), projects an image of a typical downtown core. However, when observed from close-up they resemble prisons for being hermetic and concealed (Lerup, 2011). Parking garages connect to sky bridges leading to office towers that contain underground tunnels (Fig 33). The extensive underground tunnel network consists mainly of commercial and retail activities that compete with the street.

This raises questions regarding efficient use of the extensive networks of infrastructure, the abundant available space, and of amenities that exist in the downtown core.

"the ignored, undervalued, unfortunate economic residues of the metropolitan machine" (Lerup, 2000, p.58). In the absence of planning governance,

these market-driven practices encourage wasteful thinking by treating urban land as a commodity, thereby accommodating speed and convenience

instead of urban cohesion.

Fig 35. Leapfrog development: Leap frogging creates urban voids (holey plane)

43

As a result, the entire composition of the city appears as mottled - a fragmented plane combining urban voids, awkward programmatic juxtapositions, freeways and bits of untouched natural elements. It resembles a surface "dominated by a peculiar sense of ongoing struggle: struggle of economies against nature" (Lerup, 2000, p.50).

Territory for Architecture

Lerup states that Architecture's role of creating stability and permanence, has been taken for granted in the formless city of Houston (Lerup, 2000). Dross space provides a

promising territory for Architecture as it has the unique ability to give form to the invisible and the visible spatial relationships.

By approaching the notion of urban waste as Dross in the metaphoric sense, it forces one to think about a site's

history, its relevance and flows, the processes that have created the residual space, and the governing inter-connected ecologies. This can inform design decisions for catalytic potential. It shifts the architectural perspective from

considering the object in isolation to the relationships that create the object. By approaching Dross space through the composition of subject/object, a conceptual understanding of the parts to whole relationship can be achieved where the relationship between built form and open space can become holistically integrated (Lerup, 2000).

45

From this perspective, Dross spaces takes on an important transformative role and could potentially open up a renewed dialogue between architecture and the city. Dross space

can be an architectural catalyst that connects the past with the present and the future, creating a sense of permanence, stability and socio-economic value over time.

Considering residual territories as catalysts can lead to the achievement of a more cohesive urban order, as Lerup writes "only in the hybrid field of stimdross may we begin to rethink and recover from this holey plane some of the many potential futures" (Lerup, 2000, p.62).

2.3 Alternative to the American Dream

In

1996

publication

American

Architect and theorist Albert Pope

writes that a

city's urban grid, the spatial form it produces and the urban identity it generates are interrelated (Pope, 1996).
Fig 37. Houston constructs spine based urbanism (Ladders), instead of grid block urbanism (right)

Most post war American cities have constructed a spine based urbanism, a single access closed geometry of (centripetal) grid that is finite and indivisible, as opposed to the 19th century prewar open street (centrifugal) grid system. Few examples of a centripetal system are cul-de-sac suburban developments, office parks, and shopping malls

Fig 38. Centripetal grid, Metropolitan scale, a contained and bounded figure

that create an enclosed and discontinuous built environment. This system limits "the potential for integration into an extensive urban field" (Pope, 1996, p. 63). Additionally, this closed system of urban organization creates an internal logic of operations, an internalized public domain.
Fig 39. Centripetal grid at the local scale.

Pope applies structural notation to define this closed organizational system that produces the fragmented spatial form of the metropolis, as

These spaces lacking in identity and more

accessibility impact the contemporary city

than built form, and suppress the architectural significance to which Pope refers as Primacy of space over Primacy of form (Pope, 1996).

Pope explains that these spaces have been ignored by architects and planners that prefer designing discrete areas, while ignoring the real situation of the contemporary city where space is emphasized over form. He suggests that for design to confront

Architectural form may not hold the privileged status in defining a city dominated by space, but it can spatially reposition itself to recreate a

48

dialogue between built form and open space. Pope suggests that the "key is to a revised urban strategy.. that aims indirectly at the primary

target of space through a secondary intervention of form" (Pope, 1996, p. 8). The idea is not to develop residual space through a conventional architectural intervention by filling up void spaces, but to enhance its spatial qualities by and open space. re-establishing a strong link between built form

Both Albert Pope and Lars Lerup convey that this conventional urban relationship is a vital link even in the urban development of a city

that is dominated by space; as Stims cannot exist without Dross and that only in the hybrid field of Stimdross, the city can potentially recover

from the holey plane (Lerup, 2000). In addition to revising the built form relationship, we must consider for alternatives to the closed

centripetal system of urban organization (or Ladders) as it internalizes the public domain, and contributes to the (Pope, 1996). disappearance of the city

49

Pope states that the centripetal structure was allowed to be developed in the absence of stable and centralized urban centers by 20th century

urban reformers. The 20th century planners and designers viewed the 19th century grid as "the instrument of a reductive and banal form of social organization" where it was perceived as "a threat to heterogeneity and to choice" (Pope, 1996, p. 19). The gridded city that was initially perceived as an icon of order - a form of control was

As a result of these changes, Houston's urban environment became highly introspective after WWII, from a 19th century gridded city to Albert Pope's Laddered city; favouring the trend of sprawl until the present. Both Lars Lerup and Albert Pope suggest that the goal of any city should be the "formation of the metropolitan consciousness" (Lerup, 2000, p.28). How can Architecture create a collective metropolitan sense in this formless city that continues to favour the trend of sprawl?.

2.4 The Emerging Frontier: The Downtown Core

One strategy is to approach the downtown core as the territory for creating a collective sense of place, where the sprawling suburban metropolis can identify around by the itself. In the 21st century, cities world have their re-invented downtown themselves through

extensive underground tunnel system and the in-between residual spaces don't create a public domain (Fig 61). The city lacks an alternative model of development as there are only two development patterns: either low density residential sprawl or mid to high rise hermetic office towers.

An alternative model for development is needed which would aim at creating urban cohesion while accommodating the various infrastructural flows

and generate a public domain.

Rethinking the urbanism of this Texas metropolis is a challenging task where the motto the bigger the better prevails as the status quo. Lerup states that change will not come from social consciousness but from economic or natural calamity (Williams, 2009). Therefore, the potential for any catalytic architectural intervention in the downtown depends on socio-economic and natural forces that push for alternative thinking.

per square mile) have continued to consume vast amounts of land resources. It is projected that by 2040, 81.4% of the land within the city will be developed (Fig 62). Houston's current population of 6 million people is expected to grow by 3.7 million by 2040 (HGAC, 2013, P.17). This presents a problem as huge investment in infrastructures will be needed to sustain the sprawling growth.

Additionally, the city's relentless growth and horizontal expansion has failed its natural

ecological systems. They could have benefited the city if speed, convenience and private benefits were not the primary driving motives of development. The city's natural drainage runoff systems (bayous) and its associated watersheds, have been neglected and destroyed as a result of ongoing horizontal expansion.

Consequently, flooding of the downtown core has become a major barrier for its revitalization as the city's main drainage route (Buffalo Bayou) passes through it (Fig 63).

66

67

Over the past several years, shifting demographic trends have reflected the need to inhabit the downtown core. Changing demographics such as baby boomers, young professionals, and immigrant populations

have created a demand for an alternative urbanism (HGAC, 2013).

Given the global trend of downtown rehabilitation, Houston does not want to see itself as a large Texas city but "as a world-renowned metropolis defined by its downtown and central city" (Downtown Management District, 2006, p.3). The city has started to recognize the importance of strategizing density or it may "risk losing in-migrating residents and businesses to other parts of the region" (HGAC, 2013, P.42).

According to the Houston Urban Framework plan, density can be strategized within urban centers of the city where infrastructure, services and transit will support the growth. Existing infrastructure should be utilized efficiently by increasing its usage instead of constructing new infrastructure to facilitate sprawl. Additionally, "densities

should be focused near areas that have higher amenity density, so as to build upon existing infrastructure" (HGAC, 2013, P.44).

68

An urban center has the potential to become a viable pedestrian live-work-play community if

services and amenities are accessible within a quarter-mile walking distance. In addition to

Light Rail Transit and access to amenities, the 19th century downtown grid has the potential to generate pedestrian oriented urbanism as it is composed by "smaller block sizes when compared to
Fig 64. Larger block sizes - lower connectivity

other centers" (HGAC, 2013, p.77). (Refer to Fig 64,65). Typical block sizes in the downtown core are 80x80 meters.

As the central business district of the city, it is significant for being the economic hub, containing corporate headquarters of prominent companies.

Houston's downtown core also includes left-over historical fabric and other cultural, commercial and institutional assets (HGAC, 2013). It's close proximity to the water's edge has potential for creating a waterfront character that could drive
Fig 65. Downtown core - Smaller block sizes - higher connectivity

revitalization. Waterfronts are an important asset as they can enhance the overall spatial character of a city and its collective image.

As potential catalysts for growth, these assets can attract elements of economic and demographic growth. Existing amenities, cultural and natural

69

assets, access to various types of infrastructures, and the compact grid structure; make the core a strategic location for strategizing density and becoming a collective cultural place.

However, revitalizing the downtown core through a conventional architectural intervention by filling up residual Dross space is not sufficient where conflicting infrastructural systems have created complex ground plane conditions. A holistic approach to place-making is needed which will enhance the existing spatial qualities relative to existing assets while accommodating the infrastructural

flows that shape the built environment.

2.5 Infrastructure as Framework

Over the past few decades, the concept of infrastructure has become central in various disciplinary discourses concerning the future of cities and urbanism. Given the increasing trends, formlessness resulting from urbanization systematic approach to

a holistic and

design has become

relevant. The

consideration of

infrastructure in the design agency has extended to include the design and operations of systems, rather

than being limited to designing discrete parts of the city. This has led to re-conceptualizing the role of infrastructure as a framework based on its potential for direct impact, structuring and operating capabilities on the scale of the city (Carlisle & Pevzner, 2013). The definition of infrastructure and urbanism in its basic terms are widely understood follows:

infrastructure -the basic, underlying framework or features of a system or organization

urbanism - the way of life of people who live in a large city

72

Since the 20th century, the traditional concept of infrastructure has been associated with gray infrastructure such as roads, bridges, utilities, sewage systems and communication systems; to meet the modern city's need for technical efficiency. The term exclusively belonged in the realm of engineers who relied solely on technical criteria for evaluating urban environments, "disregarding social, aesthetic and ecological functions of

space" (Waldheim, 2006, p. 171).

At

present,

the

mono-functional

realm

of

infrastructure is experiencing a paradigm shift to realize its full benefits by holistically

integrating urban and natural systems in the urban environment. Increased environmental degradation caused by urbanization, commodification of the

public realm, and accumulation of Dross sites, has led to a need to reconceptualise the role of infrastructure in addressing these issues

coherently (Waldheim, 2006). Defining contemporary infrastructure in the realm of design varies in relation to its application in design fields. the different

Given

the indeterminate and complex nature of

cities, the traditional concept of a regulated urban plan or a master plan, as a means of

controlling and organizing the future growth comes into question. How can a master plan organize future developments based on future predictions that cannot be accurately substantiated?

74

Comparatively,

Architecture's

considered as buildings set in a fixed matrix of a master plan, "becomes obsolete in the indeterminate changing environment" (Mayne & Allen, 2001, p.9).

The projective approach of a master plan which still dominates modern planning, has become

criticised for oversimplifying the complex urban field of the city into a limited time-frame and distinct categories. This goes against the dynamic nature of the contemporary city and urbanism.

A framework approach is necessary to designing cities as it allows for a structure that can stay flexible to future changes, while responding to the present needs of the city. Through phasing

as an example, framework plans can still achieve a level of control and better integration between built form, open space and infrastructural systems (Waldheim, 2006).

75

2.6 Summary

As human habitation is reliant on infrastructures, approaching it as a framework for designing

cities, territories can achieve urban cohesion in a meaningful way. By working with systems and operations instead of parts of the city, a holistic integration between built form and open space can be achieved. Addressing interconnectivity through infrastructure disciplinary as framework allows for transthe

initiatives,

and

for

Part of architecture's limitation in engaging a formless city like Houston, is its isolation from Urban Planning. The seperation between Dross and articulated objects of Stims is an example of

this. Therefore, a framework approach is necessary in activating residual space for a more unified

compositional order.

How can infrastructure

be used as a framework to

holistically integrate the relationship between built form and open space?

This hybrid, often designated as Landscape Urbanism, presents an alternative strategy for place-making, one that incorporates the reconstruction of nature in the city (Waldheim, 2006).

Landscape Urbanism believes that the horizontal organization of the contemporary American city and the horizontality of a green irrigated open field, have certain similar characteristics (Fig 69 a,b). Both decentralized conditions of the urban and natural landscapes have a horizontal organizational structure systems that (Allen, are linked by infrastructural infrastructural

Building upon the notion of Landscape Ecology, Landscape Urbanism synthesized practices such as Urban Design, Infrastructure, Ecology and Hydrology to produce new working concepts that were able to articulate a variety of ground plane conditions (Stan Allen, 2009). The surface of the city is understood as Landscape with the primary objective of returning performative and ecological functions to the ground plane (Waldheim, 2006, p.31).

80

3.2 Definition

By redefining the term Landscape, Landscape Urbanism re-conceptualizes the ground plane as an urban infrastructure (Waldheim, 2006 ,p.30). Landscape is conceived as a horizontal ecological surface condition that comprises both man-made systems and natural is systems in the as built a environment.

This redefinition allows landscape architects to play a larger role in the city by engaging with large-scale projects, while staying in the realms of their traditional expertise of working on the ground plane. Since the 19th century, the role of Landscape Architecture in the built environment was greater for responding to the social, environmental and aesthetic issues of the industrial city (Allen, 2009).

Fig 71. Prospect Park, Frederick Law Olmsted, 1880, New York City -"Tree moving machines" were invented for reconstructing nature in most urban parks in the 19th century.

Landscape Urbanism contends that by reconstructing the role of nature, cities can achieve better spatial organization (Allen, 2009). (Refer to Fig 71-73).

Fig 73. Landscape as catalyst - presented as "natural", it attracted urban development around it over time. Equally significant, the "grid block urbanism" of Manhattan played a larger role in conditioning Central Park as a restored urban space.

82

The core argument of Landscape Urbanism is that "Landscape rather than Architecture provides the basic building block of the city" (Waldheim,

2006, p.37). The best way to organize cities is through the design of Landscape and Landscape

Ecology. Urban forms should be determined by the natural ecology and developments should be shaped by landscape rather than the other way around (Waldheim, 2006).

83

3.3 Working Concepts

According to Stan Allen, the working concepts of Landscape Urbanism can be articulated in four

variables (Allen, 2009). These variables summarize the provisional themes of Landscape Urbanism as initially mentioned by landscape architect and theorist, James Corner, in the Landscape Urbanism Reader.

Allen summarizes the working methods and techniques of Landscape Urbanism in order to determine how these concepts can be physically implemented in projects. These methods signify an ecological re-

infrastructural approach that can potentially contextualize Dross sites.

1. Infrastructural scale

Since landscape is conceived as urban infrastructure with the objective to return ecological functions to the ground plane, the ambition of Landscape Urbanism is to work on an infrastructural scale (Allen, 2009). The intent that is to work the on the

ground

plane conditions of the city. By working with infrastructural components such as services,

84

supply and flow, it allows landscape architects to work on a much larger scale in the city (Allen, 2009). This approach also starts to influence the traditional domain of Urban Planning, as working on an infrastructural scale means it has to be understood in its larger regional and ecological networks. An example for this concept is the 1999 Downsview Park Competition entry by Field Operations. One of the strategies in transforming the site into an urban park was to conceive the site in relation to its larger regional system (Fig 74).

By conceiving the site within its larger regional system, it can potentially inform design decisions and integrate the site better within its context.

85

2. Surface and Pattern

Ground plane surfaces achieve a level of organization and identity based on patterns thematic to the site (Allen, 2009). Deriving these patterns from natural elements such as vegetation, water flows, drainage, contours, slope, and topography of allows for better can

86

3. Process and Change

By creating an ecological logic for the site, over time its structure will evolve as it plays itself out (Allen, 2009). In Landscape Architecture, this concept is referred to as designing a method for landscape succession by "staging surfaces" with planting regimens (Waldheim, 2006, p.28).

By staging surfaces with planting regimens, a range of diverse environments can emerge over time (Fig 77-78). The framework organization created by patterns leads to the transformation of the site over time (Allen, 2009). This concept suggests designing the site for present circumstances to some extent, while staying flexible with future uses.

Fig 77. Downsview Park Competition, Field Operations, 1999. Surfaces are "staged" with planting regimens to create unique environments.

Landscape architects believe that this concept is the most appropriate one for designing contemporary cities that are indeterminate and dynamic by nature. Instead of working towards a predetermined master plan without a guaranteed outcome, we should

consider framework approaches that will guide the evolution of urban fabric over time (Waldheim, 2006).

4. Program and Event

The

of

is

often

cited

in

the

discourse surrounding Landscape Urbanism projects, where along with the spatial qualities created by surface and pattern, public events must be accommodated in numerous ways. The site must remain flexible and open to indeterminate events and future uses (Waldheim, 2006). Through staging different landscape surfaces with various planting regimens, programmatic use is unspecified and therefore remains open to various current and future uses (Allen, 2009).

An example of this working concept is OMA'S Scheme for the 1982 Competition for Parc de la Villette. It is the most referenced example of programmatic indeterminacy in Landscape Urbanism for using landscape as a means to program space.

88

This unbuilt scheme explores the concept of creating a "social condenser on an empty lot" (ÃZKAN, 2008, p.64); by combining "architectural design specificity with programmatic indeterminacy" to establish a socially condensed environment on a metropolitan Dross site in Paris (ÃZKAN, 2008, p.5). Through the architectural design of the park's infrastructure, and the superimposition of several layers, programmatic elements can be juxtaposed to generate heterogeneous and unplanned relationships between various park programs (ÃZKAN, 2008). Instead of deriving patterns from ecology for surface organization, it uses a projective strategy of grids and parallel strips on the landscape (Fig 79).

This concept allows for a particular way of thinking about programs and events that emphasizes the qualities of the landscape as a continuous horizontal field on which program unfolds. (Allen, 2009)

mounds are the primary concerns. If not controlled, water seepage in contact with waste can pollute the groundwater systems as the landfill sits on the Fresh Kills watershed (NYC, Department of City Planning, 2001).

In the competition brief, New York State asked for respondents to consider the hydrological issues of the site which would stabilize existing sterile soil conditions to create opportunities for plant growth (NYC, Department of City Planning, 2001). Field Operations was selected for designing a layered process which would help densify soil matter and create a diversity of plant species over time (Fig 82). It would also create special qualities of place, where a variety of passive program uses could occur (Allen, 2009).

another on the north side, it would, over time create a site with a strong differentiated character. The organization of patterns and surfaces are thematic according to site conditions (Fig 82-83).

The project uses an ecological infrastructural approach in reconstructing nature. A system of swales and water retention basins is used to divert water away from the mounds and to mitigate potential erosion of the mounds. A hydrological solution was critical to the site as the capped surface of the mounds needed to be protected from releasing the toxins into the regional water systems. Additionally, a planting strategy follows the swale lines to increase water absorption, attract wild life and create the park.

Additional water gets absorbed by wooded vegetation in between. The delaying of the water speed through a meandering effect, increased water storage through swales and heavy wooded vegetation in between, mitigates flooding and erosion.

The Highline, Field Operations & Diller Scofidio + Renfro, New York City, 2005-2007

Background summary: Led by a design team of landscape architect James Corner and architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the objective was to convert a derelict rail infrastructure into a linear park. The project was conceived as a catalyst for a former industrial area in the lower west side of Manhattan by using landscape as the medium (Milbourne, 2014).
Fig 88. Circulation patterns are projected on the bridge surface to derive an order for landscape and flows.

This project implements the concept of architectural specificity to strategically determine an order for the landscape, circulation and seating areas, in order to transform this bridge into a slow speed zone.
Fig 89. The Highline creates a slow speed zone by introducing special moments along the path that attracts users and accomodates pedestrian activities. By repurposing the bridge structure and programming it with the landscape, it provides various opportunities for users to engage with the city.

By projecting proposed circulation flow patterns on to the bridge,

96

a meandering path was derived which would demarcate zones for vegetation (Fig 88). The designers preserved the rail-road character of the bridge by maintaining a linear language (Margolis & Robinson, 2007). This is reflected in the paving patterns, materiality, and seating arrangements. A few special moments along the path of the bridge break away from the linearity to frame views into the city (Fig 89). Landscape plays a critical role in staging the surface with various plant species that attract wild life, nature based tourism and create unique opportunities for Urban Design. By using a concrete linear paving system with tapered joints, the project integrated plant life on the bridge with walking and seating surfaces.

3.5 Limitations of Landscape Theory in Urbanization
As mentioned in Chapter 2, that in order to fully realize the benefits of infrastructure as a framework in revitalizing debilitated downtown cores, territories of built form, open space and infrastructural systems must be integrated holistically. Landscape Urbanism becomes controversial when contrasted with Urbanism. It emerged as a hybrid discipline between Landscape Architecture and Urban Design but it negates the role of Architecture within the realms of urbanism and as an urban formmaker.

Stan Allen has criticized Landscape Urbanism for being specific to the problems of the American city and being limited as a theory that can be applied to other cities such as in Asia or the Middle East, that are rapidly growing (Fig 91). He states that although it offers a productive model for a design process, its tools for implementation "have been limited to park-like

interventions that leave the city more or less untouched" (Allen, Ramos, Boeri, & Turan, 2009, p.17).

The design processes that incorporate landscape concepts for adaptation, transformation, growth and succession are analogous to contemporary processes of urbanization (Van der Velde, 2012).

98

The working concepts such as indeterminate programming, transformation over time, and achieving horizontal continuity with surface and pattern, are appropriate for contemporary urbanization trends. For this reason, Landscape Urbanism offers a productive model for a design process. Through these design concepts, Landscape Urbanism aims to achieve

interconnectivity in the formless American city by recovering postindustrial and Dross sites (Waldheim, 2006).

However, cities are man-made artifacts as well, where permanence and stability generated by architectural form over time contributes to collective memory and to identity of a place (Rossi, 1984). Through architectural form, cities reflect an indicator of healthy growth and embody the social relations that allow for urban life. Therefore, the core argument of Landscape Urbanism theory that "Landscape rather than Architecture provides the basic building block of the city" (Waldheim, 2006, p.37), is problematic in most dense and rapidly urbanizing cities where Architecture as an urban form maker has spatially defined its boundaries and urbanism.

Fig 91. Hong Kong

99

3.6 False Promises

Continuing on with the discussion on the limitations of landscape theory, Stan Allen states that despite the lessons learned from Landscape Urbanism with its ecological approach in transforming Dross environments and conceiving the city as an ecological model, there are contributions that are specific to Architecture (Allen, 2009).

Unlike Landscape Architecture which operates in the horizontal alignment of the ground plane and emphasizes horizontal continuities, Architecture is associated with the vertical plane where "marking out of territory and the separation of a protected interior space from nature are founding acts of architecture" (Allen, 2011, p. 24). Establishments of boundaries and limits by separating interior space from exterior is fundamental to human habitation and spatial use. This fundamental difference between landscape and architecture, contributes to the

iconic power of the architectural object, in terms of its relationship with the landscape as a vertical figure in the horizontal plane (Allen, 2011).

There are other elements where Architecture contributes to constructing the built environment as an urban formmaker as opposed to the promises made by Landscape

False promise of programmatic indeterminacy

Unlike the concept of programmatic indeterminacy where a variety of programmatic functions and unplanned events unfold in the horizontal landscape, Architects need to be specific because in programmatically unspecified places where anything can happen, nothing happens

(Allen, 2009). Architecture is

obligated to specify

programmatic functions of space that determine the use and organizational relationship of the site.

False promise of self-organization

The concept of Process and Change whereby specifying an ecological logic in the site, it will allow it to self organize itself over time, still requires specifying rules (Allen, 2009). This concept was used as part of the argument of Landscape Urbanism theory which argues that landscape rather than architecture is more flexible, adaptive and transforming in accommodating various

functions of space (Waldheim, 2006). This argument was made relative to conceiving the contemporary city as an ecological model, one that is unpredictable and

their own without the design of rules. Landscape architects still have to design a set of rules for the emergence over time of various planting patterns of the site. The concept of designing a space based on some level of prediction and precision, is still relevant.

He suggests that for architects to apply the notion of self-organization within Architecture, they

need to understand with a high level of precision what can be designed in the given moment and what cannot be designed over time (Allen, 2009). It is important to note that self-organization and the transformation of the urban fabric over time are not new concepts and deeply belong to the history of Architecture (Allen, 2011).

As referenced in Chapter 1, Aldo Rossi's Palazzo Della Ragione as an Urban Artifact transformed the urban fabric and incrementally adaptive to over time, by

Allen suggests that within the context of fluid transformations of the contemporary city,

102

we should consider the definition of Architecture as understood by Rossi, as "a geological matter, hard and persistent, yet capable of accommodating change over time". (Allen, 2011, p. 36)

3.7 Summary

In debilitated downtown cores, an infrastructural approach to landscape can be an important

catalyst for revitalization. However, Landscape Urbanism on its own cannot activate Dross with park interventions and in downtown cores that

are dominated by motion, time and event as, by principle, density creates walk-ability (Duany, 2013). Similarly, architectural density cannot

occur in downtown cores that have become debilitated due to conflicting infrastructural and ecological systems. A new synthesis between architecture, infrastructure and landscape is needed to create a sense of place that would mediate the relationship between built form and open space.

its historical past, to address the crises of its meaning within the context of formless cities. It communicated by representing its meaning rather than focusing on Architecture's instrumentality and functionality. As Allen cites Robin Evans, "a building was once an opportunity to improve the human condition, now it is conceived as an

opportunity to express the human condition" (Allen, 1999, p.50).

Much of the work in Architecture within this period, was based on a representational model that focused on critique (Fig 93). It focused on representing the contemporary issues of the city, rather than on constructing alternative realities (Allen, 1999).

While

Modernism sought to design cities following

the logic of the new model of industrial mass production, large-scale interventions and

standardization led to problems such as homogenous landscapes and social problems (Fig 94). For this

functionality and the instrumentality that once influenced the construction of the city over time, in addition to representing its meaning. (Allen, 1999).

One of the ways Architecture can reposition itself as an urban form-maker in the context of formless cities, is to consider the systematic design

approaches used in other fields. Architecture can learn from Landscape Urbanism which utilizes an infrastructural approach in working on larger

systems and connections that affect the ground plane (Allen, 2010). By understanding how larger systems affect the urban environment, it can inform meaningful design decisions and allow architects to practice more extensively.

108

4.3 Landscape Techniques in Architecture

Re-interpreting landscape infrastructural effects of surface connectivity, programmatic indeterminacy and change over time into Architecture, creates potential for renewed dialogue between built form and open space, as "the techniques of one discipline are re-contextualized within another" (Allen,

2011, p.28). In the publication, Infrastructure as Architecture: Designing Composite Networks,

Stan Allen explains how landscape concepts have been implemented within Architecture, that use an infrastructural approach in creating a dialogue between built form and open space.

Similar to infrastructures, buildings themselves are static but create surface connectivity through established programmatic functions, that trigger movement into the site (Allen, 2010). Formally, buildings have created surface connectivity by implementing topography

this reason, buildings should be considered as infrastructures as well, and be part of the equation in designing cities.

An example of this concept is the Olympic Sculpture Park by Weiss Manfredi Architects (Fig 96 a,b). By using landscape the techniques project of constructing surface

connectivity over existing infrastructure systems which disconnected the city of Seattle from its waterfront (Allen, 2011).

Sculptural pieces are placed along the paths surrounded by landscape. The site is anchored by a

pavilion on one end that is used for art exhibits and other events. Circulation paths connect the pavilion to the water, to trigger movements across the site. The site sections convey different spatial conditions that are created by new topography and landscape (Fig 97).

Yan Ping waterfront - Stan Allen Architect, (under construction) Taipei, Taiwan

This project is another example of an architectural infrastructural approach that creates surface

connectivity by constructing topography.

The goal was to connect the city of Taipei to its waterfront by designing an urban park that it can identify with. The design challenge was to connect the city while maintaining the existing 8.3 m high flood wall levee system, which physically

disconnected the site (Fig 98). An urban park could not be simply created without re-considering the levee system. By rethinking the architecture of the flood wall levee system, the architect created strategic access points to allow pedestrian

movements into the site (Gerfen, 2009).

Instead of a straight wall that would have to be maintained to protect the city from river flooding, the design approach reshaped the wall system to

resolve the issue of access, views and program (Fig 98). The serpentine form of flood wall opens up the site (Fig 99). It creates new spaces for program while maintaining the requisite height for flood protection (Gerfen, 2009).

113

Architectural Specificity/Programmatic Indeterminacy

The concept of unprecedented programmatic events accommodated by the openness of

landscape offers Architecture a model for considering the relationship between program and site (Allen, 2010). However, the spatial use of any site depends on specifying to some extent how various programmatic events can occur.

Events cannot unfold in the landscape without "concentrations of density that in turn

trigger concentrations of activity" (Allen, 2010, p.41). Prominent landscape precedents such as Fresh Kills Urban Park, the Highline, and the Olympic Sculpture Park have all had partial success due to their dense context.

Therefore,

infrastructure that offers connectivity by strategically specifying movement through

Architecture and Change Over Time

As mentioned in Chapter 3, one of the concepts of landscape is for a site's potential to evolve over time and to create distinct the

qualities of space that will influence

surrounding context. Landscape achieves this change by constructing new site ecologies as urban infrastructure, and by preparing the ground surfaces through an ecological logic, rather than through a single-surface construction approach (Allen, 2010).

By shaping and staging surfaces with different planting regimens, for landscape creates

events and therefore maintains flexibility for future change (Allen, 2010). As Stan Allen emphasizes, what this means for Architecture is to consider what can be designed in the present moment and what needs to be left open to future changes. By designing strategic aspects of the urban fabric that can be controlled, it leaves future possibilities for the context to adapt around it over time.

One of the project examples for designing for change over time, is the Taichung Gateway Park. This was a framework plan for repurposing a former airport site which left 240 hectares of void space in the urban fabric after relocating in the 1990's (Allen, 2008).

Over time, the large-scale site became encircled by built fabric of various uses and scales, that created demands for the urban void to be activated. Considering the large scale of the

site, this design was mainly invested in what the city could control such as the roadways and park (Allen, 2008)

The architectural strategy was to create a framework infrastructure for the park that provided spatial order for various elements such as circulation, landscape ecologies, new cultural institutions, and public anchors (Fig 104).

Fig 105. The strategy was to design key features of the site to restore the urban void into a place. The design focused on creating the figurative landscape and an iconic architectural form which would create new identity for the site and guide new developments around it over time.

120

The project strategically defined zones for the figurative landscape, while opening up edges to future developments over time

(Allen, 2008).

One of the key infrastructural architecture design elements was the gateway structure that bridged the park and urban fabric at the north end of the site (Fig 106). The architect created an iconic presence with these buildings that projects as over the These

buildings rest on a bridge structure that maintains the horizontal continuity of the figurative landscape (Allen, 2008).

121

4.4 Summary

Architecture can have a more meaningful role in engaging with the formless city if it repositions itself as infrastructure. By engaging with larger infrastructural systems that affect territories and impact the spatial order of the city, Architecture can potentially extend its specific design expertise to encompass designing larger urban systems and structures. Landscape Urbanism teaches us that design can operate at the level of infrastructure where form and function work together, neither one following the other. It teaches us that a systematic design approach can integrate Dross territories holistically and ecologically.

How can architecture, infrastructure and landscape together integrate residual space, and invent

spatial qualities for creating a place?

122

CHAPTER 5 : Design Project

123

If

Architecture interior

creates and

boundaries and connections between exterior space, how can it create a bounded public domain sense of in an place which will generate infrastructural dominated

and marginalized site?

124

5.1 Project Description

By identifying an actual subject - a site for experimentation, Architecture's instrumental

capacity for integrating disjoined surfaces and creating public domain can be explored. This

thesis is an effort to investigate how design can implement urban cohesion between the segregated domains created by infrastructural systems and generate public realm, creating socio-economic

value in residual space.

An ideal site would be where infrastructural systems intersect the ground plane to create residual inbetween territory and where restoring such a site can generate public realm by creating a unique spatial experience through design.

A criteria for identifying the potential site was used -

125

Criteria for identifying potential site:

1. Infrastructure has cut off the ground plane creating a residual site

2. Site as potential catalyst for activating dross space

3. Infrastructure intersects with key assets & open space

4. Potential to generate pedestrian activities

The site consisting the University of Houston Downtown was chosen as it met the specified criteria. It intersects with infrastructural systems that have created residual sites. It is already somewhat activated by student activities and can be accessed directly by the light rail transit. The entire campus is situated within the 5 min walking radius, therefore restoring this site as a pedestrian campus and its location on the waterfront can potentially allow the site to become a catalyst for other residual spaces.

The landscape conditions of the site are comprised of impermeable surfaces created by an extensive use of concrete. Concrete street furniture, paths, spread footings, parking surfaces and concretized banks dominate the site. Erosion takes place along the edges of the bayou where it has not been stablized. Invasive species overcoming leftover native vegetation are changing the character of the bayou and don't accomodate wildlife habitats. These conditions contribute to a neglected site.

There are unique spatial conditions along the bridge that have the potential to create public interest. Spaces such as the bridge ramp which spans over the bayou, create a unique condition for being closer to the water, in ways that cannot be experienced anywhere else as the ramp spans directly over it (Fig 124 (c)). It can provide a unique opportunity to experience the bayou which is often ignored and driven by. The Main Street bridge offers unique views to the city and to the historic fabric around it that can potentially contribute to creating public interest as these Urban Artifacts have been forgotten.

(e)

146

There is no defined boundary for the site which indicates where the campus starts and ends. On the north side, the freeway spans over the bridge, creating an unaesthetic condition for pedestrians to walk by (Fig 124 (e)). The bridge is 22 meters wide, shared between the tramline, pedestrian corridors on each end, and two car lanes. Some areas of the bridge will have to be widened for transforming this bridge into a pedestrian zone. Areas along the tramline can be widened as the tramline cuts off the circulation.

147

5.3 Site History

The historic significance of the site relates to the fact that it was the first port of Houston which connected the city with the rest of the world, and therefore is considered as the "birth place of Houston". Locally
Fig 125. Allen's Landing - first port and Main street evolved the 19th century downtown grid.

known as the Allen's Landing, the site was strategic for laying the city grid as the confluence of the two bayou's served as a natural turning basin for port activities. The site - being 50 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico, gave protection from storm surges

(Fisher, 2014).

Houston as a 19th century industrial city, grew in land from the site with the downtown core being the central hub and Buffalo Bayou as the primary transportation infrastructure. As

a result of port related activities the heavy wooded riparian forest was cleared off its banks to serve the shipping and rail industry (Fisher, 2014).

5.4 Alterations to Buffalo Bayou

Since Allen's landing was designated as a port of delivery in the 19th century, significant alterations to Buffalo Bayou were made in the late 1800's. In order to improve navigation and allow for deep water vessels through the meandering bayou, U.S Army Corps of Engineers recommended dredging of the shallow bayou to allow for deep water ocean vessels. bayou was dredged from 9ft to 12 ft.

How can infrastructure be used as a catalyst to restore a university campus and revitalize drosscape along Buffalo Bayou?

153

5.5 Design Principles

As mentioned in Chapter 3, the concept of infrastructure field over the has last emerged in the design in

decades,

primarily

the inter-discipline of Landscape Urbanism. Three prominent examples of built projects that use landscape to restore the and infrastructural sites are park

techniques the

residual

Highline,

Olympic

Sculpture

and the Fresh Kills Urban Park. The Olympic Sculpture Park constructs new topography to bridge over existing infrastructural systems to create surface continuity for accessing the waterfront. The Highline reuses a

redundant bridge infrastructure and landscape techniques to create a linear park experience which would serve as a catalyst for the

adjacent neighborhood. The Fresh Kills Urban Park uses landscape ecological techniques

to create infrastructural spatial qualities for restoring an ecologically bereft landfill into an urban park and catalyst. Learning from these precedents, the thesis proposes to create certain rules that guide the vision for the site to transform it into a catalyst.

154

6 STEPS FOR RESTORING THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND ACTIVATING DROSSCAPE ALONG BUFFALO BAYOU

1.

Adaptive reuse of existing infrastructure Programming the bridge Creating interconnectivity with proposed buildings Bridging the Linear Park Renaturalization of the bayou Rules for campus expansion

2. 3.

4. 5. 6.

The university campus is separated from the city by the river of the Buffalo Bayou. The Main Street Bridge and other bridges on the east and west side are the only connection points. The university campus is fragmented with 3 distinct campus buildings as anchors but nothing in between that establishes an urban connection.

155

Due to flooding, the ground plane in the Bayou only has built form that has been there from a long time ago or buildings that were constructed on top of a super- structure that would protect it from flooding. This reality has brought a lot of neglect to the site with no real plan or strategy as to how to address the flooding while maintaining space for nature and people. Currently the UHD building addresses the flooding in the site with a parking garage at the lowest two levels with a jail and police station (Fig. 136 (a)). To move forward in revitalizing this site, there needs to be an implementation of natural processes to accomodate the flood plain and potentially link the river front to create a park. Strategies need to be formed to create edge conditions along the empty infrastructure and residual space.
Fig 136(a). Underneath the Main St. Bridge. The University is built above the flood plain by resting on top of a parking garage that consists of a police station.

The existing infrastructure can play a key role in connecting urbanity to the University of Houston Downtown campus. Looking at (Fig. 136 (b)) these

buildings reside in a 5 minute walking distance and are connected by the Main St. bridge with an existing tram line Â­ recently extended north. In Houston the heat is a major factor in driving people indoors unless considerable effort is taken in designing an urban space that can protect people

from it. At the same time the overall built form of the bridge or relationship of the bridge to adjacent buildings needs to be addressed. A boundary of built form needs to be created to give scale to the users and intimacy with the surroundings. A number of existing underused bridges connecting south and north Houston can be activated to alleviate traffic 1. Adaptive reuse redundant bridge infrastructure

on the Main Street Bridge in order to give more space for pedestrians and possibly new buildings that engage the landscape, bridge and city. The first step in the design intervention was to create a pedestrian spine of urban activity that would connect the three anchors (ecological center, rowing club and the arts building) with the UHD campus and back to the city. That was then used as a way to connect to other forms of existing infrastructure in order to establish three dimensional connectivity from the bridge and to the Bayou (Fig 138).

By utilizing the existing bridge, all the active program can be placed on the bridge while protecting the landscape below (Fig 141). It opens up the site to various uses while being resilient to flooding by placing institutional, commercial and cultural program above the flood line and recreational below (Fig 142). This activates and programmatically connects the site end to end and above/below. By curating new program combinations that can be flexible for various institutional and cultural uses, the proposed program is compatible for a university campus setting

while encouraging waterfront recreational activities. At present, their is no bayou ecological center in Houston, nor any rowing facilities that directly access the bayou. As a liberal arts institution, University of Houston Downtown does not have much variety in the arts program despite the growing demand in the downtown entertainment sector.

Fig 143. Place the attractors while keeping the span of the arch clear.

The programs are placed on the bridge to create anchor points, to trigger motion across the bridge and into the landscape, while keeping the span of the arch clear (Fig 143).

163

Fig 144 (a). The formal order was derived from the existing structural grid of the bridge. By projecting and intersecting lines into the landscape, an architectural language was derived for the buildings.

One strategy to derive an order to place program on this banal bridge is to extract patterns from its structural grid. This strategy aims to maintain the linear language of the bridge while creating new spatial relationships by projecting lines towards key views into the site (Fig 144 (a,b).

The galleries interconnect with each other while framing views to the landscape. The two main galleries anchor the circulation which wraps

On the mid section of the bridge, a student lounge and the arts building anchors the space.

There is a cafÃ© on the ground floor level on the bridge with a atrium that extends vertically, interconnecting the two floor plates while keeping the visual connection with the bridge. The theatre portion bridges above the Main street bridge creating a visual gateway while framing a view from the theatre to Bayou. The circulation is oriented along the exterior with interstitial common space Â­ this creates large views to the city and other elements around the site (Fig 154 b,c,d).

Deck surface pattern: The surface patterning is a mix of soft and hard scape that has been oriented to emphasize the internal structure of the bridge as well as the key views off the site. The hard-scapes are composed of precast concrete pavers and Ipe decking. The soft-scape ranges depending on where you are on the bridge. Grasses are used on the north side to create vertical scale with the buildings around it. Smaller grasses are used on the south to reinforce the landscape edges where the Ecological Centre is located. Grasses are also used on the steps on both the restaurant and Student Centre.

183

Fig 169. Bridge Linear Park - In order to transform this bridge into a pedestrian park space, it had to be extended at key locations. Areas along the tramline (indicated as red), are extended to increase the width along the tramline.

The bridge deck was extended along the tram line in key areas to allow the creation of pedestrian platforms. Additionally, rooftops of the buildings (indicated as green) provide new pedestrian space and opportunities for engaging with the landscape (Fig 170).

184

Landform Bridge - Entrance: New deck extension along the west end of the bridge creates a canopy for the farmers market with outdoor exhibition space at the top. Landscape intersects the two vertically, providing a shaded area for the outdoor exhibit space above while staying uninterrupted at the bottom to allow for market activities (Fig 171).

as a precedent for re-naturalizing other areas of the bayou (Hung, 2013). There were similar site specific landscape issues such as eroding banks, concrete edges, dying vegetation, obstructed access and views to the street. Seasonal storm water flows cause soil friction along the banks causing it to erode, as removal of heavy wooded riparian

vegetation and impermeable surfaces contributed to a higher rate of water flow velocity reaching the bayou (Hung, 2013). The edges of the bayou were stabilized by open gabion cages that were filled by 12,700 metric tons of rock and recycled crushed concrete (Fig 184). The porosity of open gabion cages allowed for tree roots and riparian ground cover to form a natural edge (Hung, 2013). The root

system of riparian vegetation grows horizontally, providing additional soil stabilization over time (Fig 185).

This re-animates the ecological character of the Bayou previous to its pavement by meandering flow patterns and increasing flood conveyance through a swale system.

Landscape zones of Buffalo Bayou Figurative Landscape

Based on the Buffalo Bayou Masterplan, distinct ecological zones were derived that are native to the Buffalo Bayou. These include:

5 zones - Riparian forest - Wild flower gardens - Prairies - Wetlands - Forests

These zones create an additional buffer system along the swale lines and are flood compatible. By overlapping ecologies, a differentiated landscape character can be established, attracting wild

life and creating new identity for the site. The landscape figure changes during the dry and wet seasons.

5.7 Conclusion

This design project demonstrates that Architecture, when combined with Landscape Urbanism practices informed by a deep understanding of the local manmade and natural infrastructure of Drosscapes, has the potential to rejuvenate post-war urban centres in car-dominated American cities. While Landscape Urbanism theory has recognized the criticality of a holistic approach to urban interventions, addressing ecology, geography and human infrastructure at ever-larger scales of consideration, it has devalued architecture's efficacy within this open terrain.

Architecture and program, in this case new university facilities, and cultural and recreational programs, both animate the site and catalyze its future growth and connectivity. Through an operation of editing the

existing infrastructure and drawing upon its form and monumentality to generate a language for new built form; spatial coherence and destination are restored within this amorphous and degraded urban centre. The project creates a new identity for the site by integrating architecture, landscape and infrastructure while respecting the existing arch and bridge as Urban Artifacts to create form, place, meaning and connectivity

Appendix a.2 : Design Process

221

Design Process

Bridge Grid
By extracting the the patterns of the bridge structural grid, it provided an order to place the proposed program onto the bridge.

222

223

Majority of the programs are placed on the east end of the bridge as the tracks of the tramline occupy the west end of the bridge. The strategy was to build over or along the existing heritage railing as it cannot be removed. Similarly, the structure of the bridge has to be preserved as a heritage element, therefore the programs are placed directly on the bridge deck.

Landscape re-naturalization layers

226

After deriving geometrical order for the program, the next step was to work out the placement of the buildings with existing pedestrian interface between the landscape, historic First iterations of the design were

railing and individual buildings.

conceptual explorations on how landscape and program massing can fold to become a linear system to provide pedestrian experience. By placing the

program on east side of the bridge, circulation of the tramline is not obstructed. The best views into the site are along this end, however

due to the presence of the historic railing, program is cantilevered from the bridge. A green strip notating linear park folds over the volumes to provide potential access and pedestrian experience.

227

Ecological Center

The ramp continues off the bridge and becomes the roof of the ecological center, creating new potential for ecological park space that will be accessed by pedestrians.

Circulation connecting the ground plane into the center can be through stairs from the street and ramps that provide access into the didactic landscape. The building is lifted above the existing historic railing.

228

The building is placed along the edge of the historic railing and potentially is built around it.

The initial concept was that all the gallery spaces would be at the top to protect artefacts from flood and the lobby space would be at the bottom, connected to the main stair case.

The multipurpose space (gallery and an occasional classroom, steps down towards the monumental arch to capture the view of the bayou.
229

A ramp was added to the stairs for accessible entrance that connects to landscape paths. A wider atrium in the middle accomodates reception and temporary gallery space.

The North end not be placed Arts building well with the

of the bridge needed revision as the rowing club could under the bridge due to the columns occupying space. The consisting music studios and theater did not interface sloping ramp of the bridge.

Circulation into the Arts building is connected to the bridge and to the ground plane with an elevator shaft for access to the rowing club.
235

The Rowing club was moved to the east end of the bridge for functionable spaces, direct access and views towards the water. By doing so, it could share the elevator shaft connected to the bridge. Potentially, the cantilevered stage can connect to the roof, providing additional pedestrian space and circulation.

236

The building can step down gradually towards the bayou, activating the residual space with waterfront recreation. The building would rest on terraced - earth berm on one end and lifted above on the other. This maintains access and activates redundant bridge underneath for pedestrian circulation, while connecting to the bridge

237

238

239

Formal explorations: After acheiving some sense of order in terms of how program and circulation can interwine on the bridge, further formal explorations were done to achieve an architectural language that informs the bridge holistically and spatially define interior spaces better.

240

The ecological center was revised to find a fluid formal language where interior paths can create a meandering experience surrounded by galleries, framed by views and trees. The gallery sizes were expanded to optimize its functionality.

241

242

243

244

Although this scheme is more interesting then the previous one as it is spatially following a similar meandering language of the bayou, it projects too far into the landscape, which would compromise native vegetation and require increasing amounts of structural columns.

245

The student lounge space, Arts building and the rowing club was also revised to compositionally distribute the mass better so it does not interfere with the renaturalized landscape below, while optimizing

existing infrastructure. The rowing club was moved on the existing bridge ramp and "on the bayou", making the building appear more linear and extended towards key views on the water. The Arts building hovers above the existing bridge inorder to optimize existing infrastructure for placing support structure on and for meeting the spatial requirements of arts program.

246

247

248

The Rowing club and the arts building hovering above - provides a new boundary along the north end of the bridge. The rowing club is situated on the existing bridge ramp, and directly on the bayou. It was initially envisioned as a curvateous form that would speak to the fluid language of the bayou.

249

Compositionally, the programmed bridge appears more balanced with the landscape compared to before and formally starts to express the fluid, meandering language of the bayou. It structurally utilizes the existing bridge more efficiently by being placed on it directly with the exception of the ecological center.
