LOCAL CALIBRATION OF MEPDG RUTTING MODEL FOR ONTARIO'S SUPERPAVE PAVEMENTS By Gyan Prasad Gautam Master of Applied Science, 2015 Civil Engineering, Ryerson University Toronto, Canada

ABSTRACT

The rutting models in the AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) have been calibrated to Ontario's conditions for flexible pavements of Marshall mixes, and have yet to be calibrated for the Superpave materials. This study differs from previous studies in several counts: First, the local calibration database included both Superpave and Marshall mixes . Second, two of the five local calibration parameters (the temperature and traffic exponents) were pre-fixed based on a secondary study of the NCHRP 719 report. Third, both cross-sectional and longitudinal calibrations were performed and compared. It was concluded that the Superpave and Marshall mix pavements should be separately treated in the local calibration and that the crosssectional and longitudinal calibrations behaved drastically differently in terms of residual errors. A set of local calibration parameters were recommended for future pavement design. It was recommended that trench investigations be done to further validate the results from the study.

Key words: Superpave; local calibration; Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG); rutting model; longitudinal calibration.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

First of all, my foremost gratitude goes to my mentor and supervisor Dr. Arnold (Xian-Xun) Yuan, who expertly guided me through my graduate studies since my first day at Ryerson University. The suggestions on challenges of study, essential materials, encouragement, continual support, guidance and compassion throughout the work as well as his ideologies and teachings are of immense values for me for which I am indebted. Without his remarkable support and valuable contribution, this dissertation would not be possible to come into this form. His consistent mentoring developed my ethics of scientific research and motivated me to spoil in his attractive domain of civil engineering research. It is gratefully acknowledged that the research is part of the project funded by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) Highway Infrastructure Innovation Funding Program (FY2013-2015). I would like to extend my gratitude to Mr. Warren Lee from the MTO, Pavement and Foundation Section, for his generous and sincere help. As part of the Ryerson Research Group led by Dr. Yuan on the MEPDG Local Calibration, I would also like to acknowledge the great help from Mr. Afzal Waseem at the early stage of my study. Afzal kindly shared his database passed down from Ms. Gulfam Jannat, and the semi-automated local calibration procedure, which has greatly sped up my local calibration analyses. I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Desmond Rogan, the Network Administrator of the Department of Civil Engineering, for his support in Network connections. I would also like to extend my thanks to Dr. Medhat Shehata and Dr. Joseph Chow, members of the oral examination committee, for their valuable comments and suggestions. Last but not least, with due respect, I would like to thank my parents and other family members for their financial and moral support and encouragement on my study.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The modern rational pavement design method started with the Public Roads (PR) soil classification during 1920s (Huang 2004). Afterwards, many models were developed and improved but none of them significantly changed the trend of the pavement design before the road tests were conducted by Highway Research Board (HRB) during 1950s. The AASHO Road Test in Ottawa, Illinois is considered as one of the most important research project in the historical evolution of pavement design that shifted the trend of pavement design from stressbased to performance-based by establishing the empirical relationships between axle loads and structural performance of the pavements (Huang 2004). Based on the results of the AASHO Road Test, AASHTO developed its first interim design guide by 1961 and, thereafter, continuously enhanced it in years 1972, 1986, and 1993. Over the past two decades, the AASHTO pavement design guide version 1993 has served well as the primary method of pavement design in majority of highway agencies in North America. Despite its widespread use, the method is purely empirical with a limited range of design conditions that limits the validation of the models only to the original test range of geographic locations, traffic loadings, soil types and construction methods (AASHTO 2008). However, extrapolation out of the specific range of experimental conditions requires compromise on the accuracy of the method. To address these limitations, AASHTO MechanisticEmpirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) and the corresponding software had been developed under the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 1-37A by the end of 2004 (AASHTO 2008). Several subsequent updates were performed in the MEPDG and its software during 2005-2013 under the NCHRP Projects 1-40D and 9-30A. Recently in August 2013, AASHTO released the AASHTOWare pavement design software version 2.1 as its latest version for commercial purpose. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) is currently practicing its own pavement design method for design and rehabilitation of Ontario's highways, but it is anticipated 1

that the MEPDG method will be the standard pavement design method for the foreseeable future. Under this scenario, MTO also decided to use the MEPDG method for future pavement design. However, the method includes a suite of globally calibrated empirical transfer models that without local calibration, might fail to characterize the local conditions, materials and construction practices. Preliminary studies have shown that the globally calibrated models overpredict the rutting for Ontario's roads (Jannat 2012, Waseem 2013). At the very beginning of this research, the author performed a preliminary evaluation of some selected Superpave sections in order to evaluate the prediction performance of globally calibrated rutting models. The comparison between the observed and predicted total pavement rutting is shown in Figure 1.1 where the predicted values of all the sections are much higher than the field observed values as mentioned by Jannat (2012). Therefore, to implement the method in Ontario's conditions, local calibration is unavoidable.

calibration. Therefore, there is also an urgent need to pay adequate attention to the development of local calibration methodology along with database development under the Ontario's conditions. Jannat (2012) contributed on database development for Ontario's local calibration of MEPDG distress models. In particular, she developed a database of 101 section cycles integrated with high quality section specific material, pavement performance and traffic data. Using the database, Waseem (2013) developed a semi-automated local calibration methodology and performed local calibration for the MEPDG rutting models. However, a major constraint of the database was that it included only flexible pavements with Marshall mixes. Rutting as an important decision parameter of the pavement design has a significant impact on the performance of pavements by causing hydroplaning phenomena, difficulties in driving, formation of ice in the wheel path, roughness and structural damages (Xu et al. 2012). Superpave material was invented in 1993 mainly to improve the rutting resistance. A preliminary observation of total rut depth to some typical Superpave pavement sections (SPPS) and Marshall mix pavement sections (MMPS) from same location of Ontario (refer to Tables B1 to B6) are shown in the Figure 1.2. The curves demonstrate that the rutting is significantly lower in Superpave rather than Marshall mix sections. This has proved the better rutting performance of the Superpave mix. However, whether a separate sets of rutting models is required for the different mix types in the MEPDG remains to be an open question, because albeit the observed difference in rutting, this difference might be able to explained and captured by the mechanistic models in the MEPDG (for example, through the different dynamic modulus models for the different mixes).

On the other hand, pavement design requires clear projection of rutting to ensure the structural and functional requirements. The current cross-sectional calibration method that is suggested by the AASHTO Local Calibration Guide may be able to reduce both the bias and residuals to an acceptable level from the whole database perspective, but the rutting models that were so locally calibrated might still systematically over or under predict the rutting along the life cycle for a specific pavement section. This means that although the overall system bias might have been reduced to a minimal level, the section-specific bias across the life cycle may be still substantial. Calibrating the rutting models so as to reduce, if not eliminate, both the system-wide bias and section-specific bias, remains to be a challenging issue. And this involves development of some innovative local calibration method.

1.2 Problem Statement and Significance
Although MEPDG method provides a rational design approach with a solid foundation of engineering mechanics, the empirical models that relate mechanistic structural responses to predicted distresses are globally calibrated using Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) and Pavement Management Systems (PMS) database and fail to characterize the local conditions, materials and construction practices. The former studies pointed out that the globally calibrated models compromise on the accuracy of predicted pavement performance under the local circumstances. The recent studies by Jannat (2012) and Waseem (2013) also verified the result of former studies and concluded that the globally calibrated models over-predict the rutting to Ontario`s road. The same conclusion is drawn from the study of prediction performance of the rutting models for Ontario's Superpave sections under this research. So, the local calibration of rutting models are essential for realistic representation of evolution of rutting before implementation of MEPDG method to Ontario conditions. The rutting models have been recently calibrated by Waseem (2013) to Ontario's pavements with AC layers of Marshall type. Although Superpave mix has been almost exclusively used in Ontario's roads since 2001, it is still unknown whether a separate set of calibration parameters are required for Superpave pavements or not. Also, the database developed by Jannat (2012) are limited to Marshall mix types. Therefore, there is also an urgent need to pay adequate attention for database development, methodology development and local calibration of MEPDG rutting models for Superpave mixes under the Ontario's conditions. 4

This research used the Ontario's PMS database for local calibration of rutting models in contrast to LTPP or road test data that most of the former studies used. This thesis is also significant as the rutting models have yet to be calibrated to Ontario's pavements with AC layers of Superpave mixes. All these issues are to be addressed in this thesis study.

1.3 Research Objective
The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive local calibration study of the empirical rutting models of the MEPDG method for the Ontario's highway pavement design and maintenance practices. The research consist of: 1. A thorough review of previous efforts on local calibration. 2. Development of a local calibration database that includes a number of selected, typical pavement sections under MTO's jurisdiction with input data and observed rutting data from MTO's PMS database. 3. Development and comparison of local calibration procedures to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the local calibration study. 4. Recommendation of one or several sets of local calibration coefficients of the rutting models for future pavement design in Ontario using MEPDG.

1.4 Research Methodology
This research used both the cross-sectional and longitudinal calibration strategies. In the first type of model calibration, all rutting data from different sections are pooled together to obtain a single set of local calibration parameters, whereas, in the second type of model calibration, each section with a relatively long series of rut records was individually calibrated, thus, a section-bysection calibration. The Residual Sum of Square (RSS) minimization process is used during the both types of model calibration by considering the equal weight for each observed rut depth. A comprehensive literature review was performed on previous efforts for local calibration. This study raised a plenty of specific issues related to the behavior of the models (such as layer contribution, model exponents) and the type of models for new/reconstructed and rehabilitated pavement sections for full local calibration. These issues were resolved by performing a number of tests (such as t-tests and sensitivity analysis) based on the available 5

information. A local calibration database for a number of selected, typical pavement sections under MTO's jurisdiction was developed that includes input data and accuracy levels for AASHTOWare pavement design software along with the observed rutting data from MTO's PMS database. Two different local calibration methods were compared in the literature review and the optimization procedure was developed using the analysis results from the AASHTOWare environment based on least square method. Finally, the proposed cross-sectional and longitudinal method of model calibration were applied to Ontario's Superpave and Marshall mix sections and the results were verified separately.

1.5 Thesis Organization
The thesis is organized into eight chapters. The first chapter introduces the background and elaborates the need and scope of the research. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature to this study. It reviews basic concepts of rutting, historical developments of pavement design methods, overall concept and design process of the MEPDG method and the corresponding design software, the rutting models used in MEPDG, and the current practices of local calibration and the methodology used by previous local calibration studies. Chapter 3 is devoted to a discussion of the nature of field and laboratory derived plastic deformation coefficients obtained under the NCHRP Project 9-30A, particularly, the temperature and traffic exponents used in the AC rutting model of the MEPDG. Specific values of the temperature and traffic exponents are proposed for the subsequent local calibration analyses. Chapter 4 discusses the local calibration methodology used by the author for the calibration of rutting models to Ontario's roads. With a fixed set of temperature and traffic exponents, simultaneous linear equations derived from the least square principle are established for both cross-sectional and longitudinal calibrations. Chapter 5 summarizes the calibration database required for local calibration. The detailed input data regarding traffic, climate, pavement material and structure and level of accuracy used for local calibration are discussed.

Chapter 6 discusses the implementation of cross-sectional local calibration methodology and presents the results of locally calibrated parameters for Ontario's Superpave as well as Marshall mix pavement sections. Chapter 7 discusses the implementation of longitudinal local calibration methodology and presents the results of locally calibrated parameters for Ontario's Superpave as well as Marshall mix pavement sections. Finally, Chapter 8 summarizes the research with conclusions and recommendations. Appendix A, B, C, D and E describes the field and laboratory derived plastic deformation coefficients under NCHRP Project 9-30A, characteristics of the pavement sections, traffic, climate and material input data, input level and sources of these input parameters used in AASHTOWare pavement design software.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Historical Development of Pavement Design Methods
The AASHTO MEPDG has come from a long way of highway design and construction, along which generations of pavement scientists and engineers have strived to develop a rational pavement design method and various efficient construction methods through systematic experiments, sober and often painful lesson learning from failures, and bold engineering innovations of various forms. Huang (2004) provides an excellent summary of the historical development of pavement design methods. According to Huang (2004), rational pavement design method started with the Public Roads (PR) soil classification, which was the first empirical pavement design method proposed by Hogentogler and Terzaghi during 1920s. In 1928, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) method was developed by California Highways Department to estimate the thickness of layers against sub-grade shear failure based on CBR value of the materials. Further, the method was improved under Highway Research Board (HRB) in 1945 by grouping soil for the best estimate of sub-base quality and pavement thicknesses. AASHO Road Test in Ottawa, Illinois conducted by HRB during 1950s is taken as the most imperative research in the historical evolution of pavement design that contributed toward the serviceability design concept by establishing the empirical relationships between axle loads and structural performance of the pavements (Huang 2004). Based on results of AASHO Road Test, the later renamed AASHTO developed regression equations and published its first interim design guide by 1961 (Dzotepe and Ksaibati 2011). The guide was purely empirical with limited range of design parameters that includes only one climate, one sub-grade, two years life span, limited cross sections and materials, traffic volumes, specifications and construction methods (AASHTO 2008). Clearly, the equations were not compatible for all soil, traffic and climate. Despite of the many subsequent updates to the regression models up to the year 1993, the AASHTO empirical design equations still lack to incorporate complex behavior of different materials and accuracy of performance predictions. In the meanwhile, many analytically-based mechanistic empirical (ME) design methods were being developed; for example, the Shell, Asphalt Institute and VESYS pavement design methods (Monismith 2004). The methods were mechanistic-empirical, in that they incorporated 8

multi-layer analysis software such as BISAR, DAMA, VESYS, CIRCLY, and JULEA for the analysis and pavements were designed by limiting rutting and fatigue cracking on the surface of sub-grade and at the bottom of the asphalt layer respectively. Some of those analytically-based design procedure for flexible pavements are listed in Table 2.1.

2.2 AASHTO ME Design Method
2.2.1 General Framework Under the joint initiatives of AASHTO and FHWA, the MEPDG and corresponding software were developed under NCHRP Project 1-37A and completed at the end of 2004 (AAHTO 2008). The guide accounts for several advanced modeling concepts by integrating the mechanistic theories of engineering with experimental results and utilizes a user-friendly software with three hierarchical levels of accuracy for input including traffic, climate, and materials during the 9

analysis and design of new and rehabilitated pavements. The whole concept of the guide is shown in Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1: Overall concept of MEPDG The MEPDG method is a hybrid approach, representing a major shift from previous empirical methods of pavement design. It requires inputs of materials, traffic, climate and type of construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation activities. It incorporates the effects of change in inputs parameters during the service life (e.g., traffic loading, temperature, moisture content, air voids, stiffness and density of the materials) and performs the pavement analysis in two steps: engineering mechanistic analysis and empirical transfer models. For flexible pavements, the first step uses multi-layered elastic theory to evaluate structural responses (stresses, strains and deflection), whereas, the second step uses these structural responses to estimate pavement surface distresses through empirical transfer models (NCHRP 2004). The transfer models for flexible pavements includes: fatigue cracking models, thermal cracking models, rutting models and International Roughness Index (IRI) models. These models have been calibrated to actual pavement performance by using the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. Since the database used for the calibration covers a wide range of states in the USA and provinces in Canada, the calibration was called global calibration. The performance of a pavement is evaluated through the predicted distress. For flexible pavements, the MEPDG method considers AC bottom-up fatigue cracking, AC top-down fatigue 10 For: New and Rehabilitation pavements design.

cracking, AC thermal cracking, rutting and International Roughness Index (IRI) to be the major performance prediction indicators. These indicators have certain limiting values established by regional transport agencies to indicate the structural and functional condition of the pavements. The designers should ensure the pavement distresses within the pre-established limit during the design and maintenance practices in a particular jurisdictional region. The flow chart in ME design procedure is shown in Figure 2.2.

Figure 2.2: ME design procedure 2.2.2 The MEPDG Software The design software has evolved a lot since it was first introduced to the pavement community. Even the name has been changed a few times. Starting with the name of MEPDG, the software was renamed to DARWin-ME in 2011, and changed again to AASHTOware Pavement ME in 2013. The first publicly available MEPDG software version 0.7 was developed at the end of 2004 as a part of delivery of NCHRP Project 1-37A. Several updates were performed in the software during 2005-2009 under the NCHRP Projects 1-40D and 9-30A as shown in Table 2.2. The major changes during the period were 11

related to traffic and other general topics, integrated climatic model, pavement design and analysis approach. The latest research version of user-friendly software, known as AASHTOWare pavement design software, based on the mechanistic-empirical models incorporated in MEPDG version 2.1 is released by AASHTO in August 2013 for commercial purposes. This is a production-ready new generation software that represents a major revolution in the pavement design by providing a direct tie between materials, structure, construction practices, climate, traffic and design features. It is intended to simplify the day-to-day pavement design and analysis. This study is based on AASHTOware Pavement ME version 2.1. This version includes a choice on single or multi-layer rutting coefficients for asphalt rutting. It now supports summary reports for backcalculation and allows user to utilize backcalculation data for thickness optimization. It also provides an option to automatically update the system and converts the old files to version 2.0.

The first step creates a trial design for project. The second step runs the software to predict the key distresses for trial design. In the last step, it compares the predicted performance of the trial design to the performance criteria and modifies the trial design if the performance targets are not satisfied, until a feasible design solution is obtained within the performance criteria.

2.2.2.2 Hierarchical Input Levels AASHTOWare pavement design software provides flexibility to select hierarchical input levels related to traffic, material, and pavement condition as shown in Table 2.3. This is intended to help reduce the cost of material testing during pavement site investigation. So, selection of input hierarchy primarily depends upon the economic importance of the pavement structure. Table 2.3: Hierarchy of input levels Level Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 2.2.2.3 Operation AASHTOWare pavement design software also provides a database option for enterprise operation (AASHTO 2011). It includes archiving projects, creating data libraries, exporting and importing input data files. It has the capability to run many projects consecutively at same time. It uses the globally calibrated empirical transfer function to estimate the pavement distresses. However, it is also compatible for the use of local calibration coefficients in the transfer models. 2.2.2.4 Output Report Finally, AASHTOWare pavement design software generates reports in PDF and Excel formats. This report contains the summary of the inputs about the materials, traffic, climates and the calibration coefficients used in the analysis of the project. The report also summarizes the predicted distress of the pavement for entire pavement life.

2.3 Rutting in Pavement
2.3.1 Mechanism of Rutting The phenomenon of rutting in flexible pavement is the result of material densification and plastic shear deformation in all pavement layers due to repeated traffic load. However, many other internal phenomena such as poor sub-grade and base layers compaction, poor water proofing layers, weak structural design, poor construction quality and weak material stiffness also 13

contribute to rutting (AASHTO 2008). Despite of these collective and possible synergistic effects of all these factors, present rutting studies for pavement structural design only focus on trafficinduced permanent deformation. The rutting in the pavement is usually characterized in three stages, known as the primary stage, secondary stage and tertiary stage (Figure 2.3). The main features of three stages mechanism of rutting are listed below (AASHTO 2004). (a) Primary stage:          initial stage of loading high rate of rutting most rutting is due to volumetric changes of the mixture

(b) Secondary stage: small and constant rate of rutting densification decreases and shear deformation increases most rutting is due to the plastic shear deformation

(c) Tertiary stage: high rate of rutting rutting is due to the plastic shear deformation under no volume change conditions shear failure occur and the mixture flows to rupture

Modeling of rutting mechanism is required to estimate the true evolution of rutting. The MEPDG rutting models consider only the primary and secondary stages of deformation, assuming that the tertiary stage is not reached in in-service pavements, because the magnitude of rutting associated with tertiary stage yields a very high rut depth compared to the actually accepted level in the practice. Therefore, modeling for true plastic shear deformations in the tertiary stage is a research field mainly to material engineers, but not to design engineers. 2.3.2 Design Consideration Rutting as a major failure mode has a significant impact on the performance of asphalt pavement. Adding roughness, it reduces not only the service life, but also functional serviceability of the pavement due to hydroplaning, steering difficulty and ice accumulation. Significant amount of rutting adds safety challenges to highway users (Xu et al. 2012). Therefore, to ensure the structural and functional requirements, the pavement requires limiting the maximum rut depth over the pavement lifetime. Table 2.4 shows the limiting value of rutting recommended by the AASHTO MEPDG (AASHTO 2008) for different types of highway pavements. The table also shows the limiting values recommend by MTO. Unlike the AASHTO guide, MTO limits both the total rutting and the AC rutting. Table 2.4: Recommended threshold values of rutting for flexible pavement Agency Highway types Primary AASHTO (2008) MTO (2012) Interstate Other (< 45mph, or 72.42 kph) King's and Secondary King's and Secondary Total or AC rutting Total Total Total Total AC Maximum recommended value 0.50" (12.50 mm) 0.40" (10.20 mm) 0.65" (16.50 mm) 0.75" (19.00 mm) 0.24" (6.00 mm)

2.3.3 Measurement of Rutting In early days, manual methods such as wire method, straight edge method and dipstick method were used to measure rut depth (Gramling et al. 1991, LTPP 2013). An example of straight edge method is shown in Figure 2.4a where the rut depth was measured manually using a 3m straight 15

edge and displacement transducer (Gramling et al. 1991). However, these measurement approaches are not reliable and may easily result in large error because of their subjective nature. Recently, a modern automated laser scanner method is placed in service in MTO for accurate measurement of rut on the surface of the pavements. The method consists of an advanced pavement data collection vehicle equipped with Automatic Road Analyzer (ARAN). The ARAN technology utilizes a 4m laser transverse profiler with 36 ultrasound sensors as shown in Figure 2.4b to measure the surface profile including rutting, roughness and texture at about 100 mm spacing with an accuracy of 1 mm and reports the average rut depth for each 20 m or 100 m or any desired section length (Li 2011). MTO has started the use of the ARAN technology for rutting measurement since 2002. The current approach first determines the maximum rut depths in the left and right wheel path, respectively, and then reports the average of these two values as the measured rut depth for a specific pavement section (Li 2011). This research utilizes the MTO's ARAN rut depth for the local calibration of MEPDG rutting model to the local condition. However, the modern ARAN measurements are significantly updated (e.g., number of sensors, compatibility and technology) for higher accuracy. Even in MTO, the new ARAN technology uses 3D laser scan for the rutting, whereas, the old ARAN rutting was based on ultrasonic system. This technological changes can greatly influence the accuracy of the rut depth measurement which can be an issue for local calibration.

2.3.4 Forensic Investigation The concept of forensic investigation in the pavement design is to conduct the investigation of experimental test sections. It mostly focuses on investigating the underlying causes of premature pavement failure, validating pavement performance prediction, or collecting project specific data for calibration of performance perdition models (Rada et al. 2013). The surface rut depth is a general indicator of the structural performance of the pavement but it fails to provide enough information regarding the root cause of the overall rutting. Independent studies conducted by Villiers et al. (2005) reported inconsistence rut depth with traffic, time and mix properties. Therefore, careful evaluation and identification of the possible source of rutting is an important factor that provide the necessary information to the designers for rehabilitation. In this regard, Simpson et al. (1995) introduced an area technique and later on White et al. (2002) proposed an extension of the Simpson theory to explain the sources of rutting in the pavement section for a NCHRP Project 1-34A. In the report (NCHRP 468), White et al. (2002) proposed the following criteria using the total area (A) and the ratio of the positive to negative area (R) under the transverse surface profile to determine the possible dominating layers to rutting using a typical transverse profile as shown in Figure 2.5. They are: i) AC layer rutting failure, if ii) Base/sub-base layer failure, if iii) Sub-grade layer failure, otherwise. and and ; ; and

Figure 2.5: Typical transverse profile The notations used in the above criteria are explained below: (2-1) 17

(2-2) (2-3) (2-4) (2-5) where: positive and negative area of transverse profile respectively (mm2), , and

= theoretical average total area for AC failure, base/sub-base failure and sub-grade failure respectively (mm2), maximum rut depth (mm). It should be noted that although NCHRP Report 468 is entitled "Contribution of Pavement Structural Layers to Rutting of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements," the proposed method would only present a likelihood that a certain structural layer is the dominating rutting failure layer. To make it clearer, the percentage reported from the procedure refers to a probability of the layer being the caprice instead of the quantitative percentage of contribution to the total surface rut depth. According to NCHRP report 468 (White et al. 2002), percentage of layer contribution to rutting is section specific and depend on material properties, load, and climatic condition. Further, the report used an analysis of transverse surface profile to determine the possible dominating layers to rutting. Under this circumstance, a pilot study is performed using transverse surface profile of some typical pavement sections from LTPP database with long historical performance records used during global calibration in NCHRP 1-37A to identify the link between percentage of dominating layers and percentage of layer contribution to rutting. The result is compared with predicted layer contribution to rutting as shown in Table 2.5. This comparison also rejects the initial assumption of the study. The layer contribution to rutting is still indistinct and thus not used in this research. In contrast to this non-destructive technique, a destructive technique is the most accurate and widely accepted approach where the rut depth in each layer is directly measured by cutting the trenches on experimental test sections, hence known as trench analysis. The typical example of trench analysis is presented in the Figure 2.6. As shown, the advantage of the trench analysis is that it measures directly the rut depth in each structural layer of the pavement.

Figure 2.6: Trench profile analysis (Source: Hussan 2013) 2.3.5 Layer Contribution The information of layer-specific rut depth would eliminate the indeterminacy and interdependency of the rutting models during local calibration through RSS minimization in order to determine a unique solution of the local calibration parameters. The trench analysis discussed in the preceding subsection is a straight approach for determining the actual percentages of layer contribution to rutting. However, no trench analysis data has been available or made available to the research project from the MTO. Therefore, a review of past trench studies were performed. Meanwhile, a typical Superpave pavement structure designed in Ontario (200 mm AC layer, 550 mm granular base and sub-grade with = 35 MPa) is analyzed with

different software packages under this research to estimate the surface displacement. The results are presented in Table 2.6, showing contradicting observations. The software packages predict much higher rutting in sub-grade and negligible rutting in AC layer, whereas, it is just opposite from trench studies. To resolve the non-uniqueness issue, Waseem (2013) investigated the layer contribution to rutting from several aspects (e.g., global default models, elastic multilayer 19

computer packages and empirical studies) and also made similar conclusions in this regard. Finally based on literature review, he proposed a pre-set value of layer contribution to rutting for new/reconstructed and rehabilitated pavement sections separately. Because there is no further adequate evidence to support this line of argument, this research takes another approach to resolve the indeterminacy issue; the details are discussed in Chapter 3.

2.4 The MEPDG Rutting Models
The rutting models for flexible pavement in the MEPDG are based on accumulation of incremental damage for each application of traffic loading. Each material within the pavement system is divided into several analysis sub-layers and different models are used to evaluate the accumulated vertical plastic strain in each sub-layers at the end of each sub-season. The calculated plastic strain is further used to estimate the damage at the mid depth of each sub-layer for each sub-season. Total rutting for a given season is the sum of the rut depth in each layer and expressed mathematically by the following equation. (2-6) where: = Total pavement rutting at age t n = Number of computational sub-layers of the pavement structural system = Accumulative plastic strain at age t in the ith sub-layer and = Thickness of the ith sub-layer

20

To evaluate the accumulative plastic strain

for each sublayer at different age, MEPDG first

calculates the resilient or elastic strain under different seasons at various traffic loads, and then uses a set of empirical equations to calculate the plastic strain by incorporating the strain hardening principle to link the traffic loads, temperature, and age. These empirical equations are collectively called the rutting models. Note that in reality various traffic loadings are applied at different time under different climates and seasons. Thus, accumulation of the permanent deformation under different loading conditions is calculated by using the strain hardening concept discussed next in detail. But before that, the exact forms of the empirical models are explained first. 2.4.1 AC Rutting Model In 1989, Leahy proposed an AC rutting model based on his laboratory data from repeated load permanent deformation tests. Leahy's model was modified by Ayres (1997) using additional laboratory data. Later, Kaloush (2001) developed several models based on the laboratory test data with many more types of mixtures at multiple levels of temperature and loading stress. In the end, the model with temperature and load repetition term was selected by the team of NCHRP Project 1-37A to be the MEPDG model for global calibration using the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database. The general form of the AC rutting model in MEPDG, on the basis of the Kaloush model, is expressed as (2-7) where: = accumulated plastic strain at N repetitions of load = resilient strain of the asphalt material = mix (or pavement layer) temperature (Â°F) = number of load repetitions = global calibration parameter and equal to = global calibration parameter and equal to = global calibration parameter and equal to = depth confinement factor and equal to in the global MEPDG model in the global MEPDG model in the global MEPDG model by default by default

2.4.2 Unbound Layer Rutting Model Tseng and Lytton in 1989 developed unbound layer rutting model to estimate the permanent deformation behaviour based upon the type of materials. The model was modified by Ayres (1997) using same but combined data in one database. Later, El-Basyouny and Witczak (2004) modified the model to enhance its overall performance by changing the slope and intercept of the relationship between Vs during NCHRP Project 1-37A. The general form of the unbound

layer rutting model in MEPDG is expressed as (2-8) where: = accumulated plastic strain of layer or sub-layer = number of traffic repetitions = average vertical resilient strain in layer or sub-layer obtained from the primary response model = resilient strain imposed in laboratory test to obtain material properties = global field calibration parameters for unbound granular base and sub-grade material and equal to by default for both granular base and fine soil layer in MEPDG

model. Hereafter, global calibration parameters for granular base is defined by and that for sub-grade material is defined by .

= local calibration parameters for unbound granular base and sub-grade material. Hereafter, the local calibration factor is denoted by for granular base and by for

sub-grade material. Both parameters are set 1.0 by default. = material properties. These properties are the function of water content, deviator stress, bulk stress and resilient modulus of the layer and given by the following equations. (2-9) (2-10)

and

For a specific set of pavement conditions (defined by climatic and environmental conditions as well as a particular configuration and combination of tire loading), the total plastic deformation at the end of pavement age is calculated by using the so-called strain hardening concept as

shown in Figure 2.7. According to the principle of strain hardening, the total number of load repetitions at the end of pavement age is estimated by using the equivalent number of load

cycle at the beginning of that pavement age expressed as: (2-12) where: = Total number of load repetitions at the end of pavement age t = Application of traffic load during pavement age t = Equivalent number of load cycle at the beginning of pavement age t associated with total deformation at the end of each pavement age

The total plastic strain

is first calculated and

corresponds to a total number of load repetitions resilient strain layer temperature

The rutting models in the AASHTO MEPDG include two separate models, one for AC layers and the other for unbound materials, which include base/sub-base layers and sub-grade soils. These models are globally calibrated and need local calibration before use to reduce the bias. Although the predicted rutting of each layer is the explicit function of traffic load, the effects of temperature and moisture content are also included in the prediction of rutting through resilient modulus for granular layers and dynamic modulus for AC layer. 23

2.5 Global Calibration
To understand the local calibration discussed in this study, it is important to establish a good appreciation of the global calibration process, because both calibrations represent a systematic process of eliminating bias and minimizing the residual errors between observed and predicted rut depth by modifying calibration parameters in the model. This section deals with global calibration only. 2.5.1 Calibration in NCHRP 1-37A The global calibration in the NCHRP Project 1-37A initially included 136 LTPP test sections (94 new and 42 overlay sections) selected from USA and Canada. But only 88 new sections (including 1 from New Brunswick, Canada) that had permanent deformation data were used for global calibration of rutting models. The calibration process also includes 38 AASHO Road Test sections and 7 MnRoad sections. The overall calibration process is summarized in the following three steps.

24

Step One: The temperature exponent ( ) and traffic exponent ( ) were calibrated using the 88 pavement and ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 were

sections from LTPP database. Eleven combinations of

used during simulation run in two different optimization approaches for each pavement section. The first optimization was done with a constant value of and and varying to obtain

minimum RSS in total rut and zero error in AC rut, whereas the second optimization was done with varying , and simultaneously to obtain minimum RSS and zero error in total rut. = 0.9 and = 1.2) from both

The final result was the selection of same set of coefficients ( approaches. Step Two: The unbound layer coefficients and

were calibrated using 38 imaginary sections = 1.05 and = 1.35

designed by AASHTO 1993 model. The analysis found the values of

by comparing the average predicted rut depth of base/sub-base layer with 0.075" (1.9 mm) and sub-grade with 0.2" (5 mm) over 20 years. Here, the average 20 years rut depths were fixed based on a survey among nearly 40 DOT material engineers under the assumption that the rut depth should be same irrespective of the sub-grade support and traffic level. This calibration used the first optimization approach with a constant value of the first stage and found the value of = 0.9 and = 1.2 calculated from

= 0.551 using a corrected AC rut model from MnRoad

test study. The correction in AC rut model is given by; (2-13) (2-14) (2-15) where: = depth confinement factor as a function of total asphalt layer thickness and depth to computational point = depth below the surface = total AC thickness Step Three: Further, the calibration was performed with LTPP pavement sections using second optimization approach taking the previously found coefficients = 0.9 and 25 = 1.2 as a constant values. The

calibration process also utilized a corrected AC rut model from MnRoad test study and the final

selected result was

= 0.509,

= 1.673 and

= 1.35.

Thus, the results from this three steps global calibration process was used to obtain the calibration parameters for rutting models to equations 2-7 and 2-8 which were, = plastic deformation factor representing intercept of the logÂ­log relationship between the number of load applications and cumulative plastic strain and equal to - 3.4488 based on the global calibration effort for all AC mixes = plastic deformation factor related to the effect of temperature on intercept and equal to 1.5606 based on the global calibration effort for all AC mixes = plastic deformation factor representing steady-state slope related to the effect of wheel loads and equal to 0.4792 based on the global calibration effort for all AC mixes = global field calibration parameters for granular base/sub-base and is equal to 1.673 based on the global calibration effort = global field calibration parameters for fine soil layer and is equal to 1.35 based on the global calibration effort = local calibration parameters and equal to 1.0 for the AC mixtures based on the global calibration effort , effort From this calibration process, It is noted that the original model developers in Project 1-37A already pointed out the need of trench analysis. Further, a preset value of rutting for base/subbase and sub-grade layer is fixed from export knowledge during the analysis of the 38 AASHO road test sections because of lack trench analysis. 2.5.2 Validation in NCHRP 1-40A An independent comprehensive third-party engineering review of the rutting models developed under NCHRP Project 1-37A was performed under the subsequent funding support of NCHRP Project 1-40A. A number of issues were raised regarding the technical aspects, design reliability, nature and calibration of the distress models, and properties of the pavement layers (NCHRP 2006). Based on their study, the reviewer recommended for: = local calibration parameters and equal to 1.0 based on the global calibration

26

(i) Local calibration of the distress models rather than continuously adjusting the global calibrations, (ii) The use of mixture-specific plastic deformation coefficients to individual AC layers, (iii) Recalibration of the AC transfer functions of NCHRP Project 1-37A. These recommendations all have been considered in the later development and enhancement of the MEPDG. A local calibration manual was developed and released in 2010 (AASHTO 2010). Many state-wide and even municipality-wide local calibration studies have been subsequently conducted; these are reviewed in Section 2.6. The use of mixture-specific coefficients were allowed in the latest AASHTOware Pavement ME software, although what different coefficients to be used for different mixtures remains unknown. Validation and recalibration of distress transfer functions were performed under NCHRP Project 1-40D with correct estimation of resilient modulus and expanded database. This calibration effort resulted in a new set of global calibration parameters 1.5606, = 0.4791, = 2.03 and = - 3.3541, =

= 1.67 which are incorporated in the later versions of

the AASHTOWare. The study of NCHRP Project 1-40A also recognized a large bias related to AC volumetric properties as a major limitation of using one set of plastic deformation coefficients for all AC mixes. To enhance the rutting prediction accuracy, mixture-specific coefficients as given below were suggested to replace the global calibration parameters. (2-16) (2-17)

2.5.3 Recent Development in NCHRP 9-30A NCHRP Project 9-30A represents a more recent effort of the MEPDG research community to upgrade and enhance the performance of the rutting models (Von Quintus et al. 2012). The research outcomes were summarized in the NCHRP Report 719. Among many useful conclusions, the team concluded that the global value of the traffic (N-term) exponent is too high, whereas they observed a contradictory result for the temperature exponent detailed analysis of NCHRP Report 719 is discussed in Chapter 3. The NCHRP Project 9-30A focused on enhancing and populating the database to upgrade the prediction performance of the MEPDG AC rutting model developed under NCHRP Projects 1-37A and 1-40 by recalibration process (Von Quintus et al. 2012). The recalibration process contributed toward the measurement of AC rutting property testing protocols (triaxial test vs. shear test) in the laboratory for fixing the local calibration parameters. Also, the process involved the use of same database for a comparative study of the different AC rut depth transfer models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and robustness to identify the possibility of their use as alternative models. In this regards, the following three rut depth transfer function were added to the MEPDG software version 9-30A, which unfortunately has not yet been made publicly accessible as of the time the thesis is written. (i) WesTrack shear strain and stress transfer function, (2-20) where: = permanent shear strain at a depth of 2 inches beneath the tire edge = corresponding resilient or elastic shear strain = corresponding elastic shear stress N = number of load cycles a,b,c = regression coefficients, recommended a = 2.114, b = 0.04, and c = 0.124 for conventional AC mixtures (ii) Verstraeten deviator stress transfer function, (2-21) where: = permanent or plastic strain and = vertical and radial stresses 29 0.479 .A

= dynamic modulus of asphalt mixture N = number of load cycles f = frequency of load, Hz and = regression coefficients

(iii) Asphalt Institute vertical strain and deviator stress transfer function, (2-22) where: = plastic strain = resilient strain = mix ( or pavement layer) temperature = number of load repetitions = deviator stress = viscosity of the asphalt binder = effective asphalt content by volume = air void volume All these models have a traffic term, all in exponential form. Some models do not have temperature term, arguing that the temperature effects have been considered in the dynamic modulus model. The use of these different transfer models resulted in insignificant error in predicted rut depths. However, there are some other important differences, such as the consideration of confining pressures and testing protocols. Therefore, Von Quintus et al. (2012) performed a study on the effect of stress state (confining pressure, deviator stress) and temperature on plastic deformation coefficients by triaxial repeated-load permanent deformation test as a part of NCHRP Project 9-30A. 2.5.3.1 Effects of Stress State The study showed that a small confining pressure of 10 psi (689.5 KPa) considerably reduces the plastic strains throughout the test but it remains almost same to 20 psi. On the other side, the effects of deviator stress level on the plastic strain relationship was observed specially at higher number of loading cycles. However, the differences in slope was insignificant at 50-psi in 30

comparison with 30-psi deviator stress. Therefore, the NCHRP 9-30A team recommended confining pressure of 10 psi and deviator stress of 50-psi for the test. The major observation from this study is that the slope of plastic strain relationship ranges from 0.17 to 0.35 which is same to the field derived value of N-term exponent given as in NCHRP report 719, Table 8 and 9 (refer to Table A-1 and A-2 in the Appendix of the thesis). NCHRP 9-30A team further observed slight but systematic difference between the repeated-load triaxial and shear strain in the primary stage of rutting, however, the slope of the secondary stage almost remains within the range of 0.15 to 0.40 as reported in NCHRP report 719, Tables 24 and 25 (refer to Table A-3). 2.5.3.2 Effects of Temperature Similarly, the study characterized the overall temperature effect by power law trend lines. The value of trend line coefficients was around 1.0 and was the image of the temperature exponent value which is substantially less than its corresponding globally calibrated value of 1.5606, although it was dependent on the volumetric properties of the mixtures. On the other side, a contradictory result is observed for temperature exponent through repeated-load triaxial and shear tests as reported in NCHRP report 719, Tables 24 and 25 which is significantly high with respect to its global value of 1.5606. Under this scenario, the team observed accurate simulate the AC layer rutting with global value of temperature exponent by simply adjusting the intercept value with field conditions. Thus, their study found that all the models incorporated in the MEPDG software Version NCHRP 9-30A accurately simulate the evolution of AC layer rutting with proper calibration using repeated-load plastic deformation tests (shear and triaxial) that allows the user to enter the layer-specific permanent deformation parameters and provide a choice of transfer functions for predicting the rutting behaviour of the AC layer. 2.5.4 Remarks Based on the discussions in this section, it is clear that the model coefficients differ in each global calibration exercise and they are influenced by the properties of the pavement materials. However, the global calibration studies continuously put their efforts to upgrade the prediction performance of the models by taking account of the material properties in both field and laboratory environment. The latest effort on NCHRP Project 9-30A is taken as the basis for this research. 31

2.6 Efforts on Local Calibration
Many highway agencies in North America have prepared plans to implement the AASHTO MEPDG in the practice of design and rehabilitation of the pavements. However, due to the difference in input parameters for different jurisdictional regions, the global rutting models result in significantly biased prediction. Therefore, transportation agencies throughout North America started partial or full local calibration studies of the empirical distress models to use it in local level. The previous local calibration studies in U.S. and Canada are summarized below. 2.6.1 The Local Calibration Guide To facilitate and somehow unite the local calibration studies that many transportation agencies need to do, AASHTO (2010) developed a Guide for the Local Calibration of the MechanicalEmpirical Pavement Design Guide (or "Local Calibration Guide" hereafter for brevity) . This guide elaborates the step-by-step procedure of local calibration. The basic steps are summarized in the form of a flow chart in Figure 2.8.

According to the guide, the local calibration process starts by selecting the accuracy level for each input parameter. The selection of input accuracy is influenced by agencies because of their policy differences but it is better to use the highest level of inputs available at the time of design to improve the standard error of the prediction model. The guide also specify a minimum number of pavement sections for local calibration studies. For the rutting study, it recommended a minimum number of 20 pavement sections at a significance level of 90%. The guide further suggests a fractional balance factorial of the key factors such as climatic zone (geographical regions), pavement types (new and rehabilitated sections), truck traffic application (highway type), etc. when selecting the roadway sections for the study. These recommendations are considered in this research study. The next major step of local calibration stated by the guide is the extraction of project specific data such as location parameters, traffic loading, material properties, design structure and performance observation. This study developed a local calibration database for selected, typical pavement sections from MTO-PMS including all these features. Before optimization of the models, the guide recommended for the validation test of the global models by comparing the predicted verses observed performance data in terms of bias and standard error. Based on the findings, local calibration coefficients are adjusted to eliminate the bias and reduce the standard error by optimization process. Finally, the optimized models are compared with global models, and calibration results are validated for general use. 2.6.2 Local Calibration Efforts in USA Many states in the USA have completed their local calibration studies. For Montana State, VonQuintus and Moulthrop (2007) focused on implementation of MEPDG distress models in local conditions using 102 new, reconstructed and rehabilitated AC pavement test sections: 34 LTPP and 13 non-LTPP pavements sections from Montana and 55 LTPP sections from adjacent US States and Canadian provinces. The analysis using material test data, historical traffic data with input level 1 and level 3 showed that the global models significantly over-predict rutting, which is similar to what Jannat (2012) and Waseem (2013) have observed recently for Ontario's roads. Also, the model resulted in significant erroneous predictions to AC rutting. Similarly, the field investigation showed that most of the rutting occurred in the AC layer. Based on these findings, Von Quintus and Moulthrop proposed a new method for local adjustment factor of AC 33

layer ( and sub-grade (

) as described in NCHRP Project 1-40 and a value of 0.20 for both base ( ) material.

)

For Texas, Banerjee et al. (2009) calibrated MEPDG distress transfer functions for flexible pavements using eighteen Specific Pavement Studies (SPS) 1 and 3 sections from LTPP database of 5 different geographical regions. They established the overall default calibration coefficient of Texas for input Level 3 using the average of Level 2 calibration coefficients of these regions. Trial runs were conducted for all regions separately with multiple combinations of the calibration coefficients to minimize the RSS between predicted and measured values. During this study, for AC rutting model was fixed to one by assuming that the temperature

dependency of the specific material depends upon its mix properties and should be determined in the laboratory. Similarly, the calibration coefficient for unbound sub-grade material ( ) was set

to the regional default value on the basis of average moisture content of the sub-grade soil. Although, the proposed calibration parameters can be safely used for the regions and location undertaken in the study, it pointed out the possibility of further updates on these calibration parameters by calibrating all the sections jointly with additional data sets. For Washington State, Li et al. (2009) conducted local calibrated of MEPDG rutting models for flexible pavements using level 2 inputs from WSDOT default value. Five basic steps including: (a) bench testing (b) model analysis (c) calibration (d) validation, and (e) iteration are followed during the calibration process. The sensitivity study of various input parameters showed that the global models under-predict rutting for Washington State pavements, which is opposite to what Jannat (2012) and Waseem (2013) have observed for Ontario's roads. Also the model was found less sensitive to layer thickness and resilient strain which helps to conclude that the corresponding rutting model calibration factor ( ) should be very near to its global value.

Meanwhile, the observation of historical pavement performance data from WSPMS showed very small rutting in sub-grade of Washington State pavements. So, Li et al. (2009) preset zero for the local calibration coefficient for sub-grade ( ). Among the 18 possible subgroups categorized

based on 3 traffic level with different AADTT, 2 sub-grade soil types with different resilient modulus and 3 different climates, only eight subgroups having section information were used for calibration. The calibration process involved an iterative method with a set of calibration parameters to obtain least value of RMSE between the MEPDG prediction and WSPMS measures. 34

For Ohio State, Glover and Mallela (2009) performed validation and recalibration of MEPDG rutting models for new and reconstructed AC pavements using 13 LTPP projects with sufficient amount of distress data. The statistical and non-statistical analysis was performed to determine overall adequacy of MEPDG model in terms of prediction capability, accuracy, and bias under Ohio conditions. Considering the biased predictions and poor correlation as a result on findings, Glover and Mallela (2009) purposed modification to the local calibration coefficients , and only which significantly improved the model accuracy but not the bias. So, and of the AC rutting model by laboratory

they further purposed recalibration to

investigation of accumulation of permanent deformation with repeated loadings. Darter et al. (2009) presented a final report on "Implementation of MEPDG in Utah: validation, calibration and development of the UDOT MEPDG user's guide" for Flexible Pavement Design to the Utah Department of Transportation Research Division. The study focused on the validation and calibration of the MEPDG distress prediction models for new, reconstructed and overlaid AC pavements using data from both LTPP and UDOT's pavement management system. The statistical and non-statistical analysis showed biased and poor correlation between the measured and predicted rutting specially for new Superpave pavement under Utah conditions. So, Darter et al. (2009) purposed optimization of model's local calibration coefficients using SAS statistical software maintaining the proportion of the contribution of each layers to rutting. A sensitivity analysis showed that the locally calibrated model significantly improve the goodness of fit and removed all significant bias. For Arkansas, Hall et al. (2010) presented a study of MEPDG local calibration and validation for flexible pavement models using 26 sections (20 for calibration and 6 for validation) from LTPP and PMS database. Depending upon the information available for traffic, climate and structure, they used all three input level for Iterative runs of the MEPDG using discrete calibration coefficients to minimize the RSS between predicted and measured values. But, the calibration coefficient for granular base was set as one assuming that the rutting mostly occur in AC and sub-grade layers. It is found that the local calibration improve the prediction performance of the rutting models. Thus, it sets up a basic outline for MEPDG local calibration procedure, however the paper strongly recommended to collect more rutting data in the PMS database before implementation of the MEPDG in Arkansas. 35

For Arizona, Souliman et al. (2010) performed the calibration of the MEPDG predictive models for flexible pavement using 39 Arizona pavement sections included in LTPP database. The study focused on the development of ADOT database for MEPDG input parameters related to asphalt binders, asphalt mixtures, base and sub-grade materials, climate, and traffic characteristics. The data obtained from LTPP and ADOT databases were used for optimum calibration coefficients producing least sum of squared error and zero sum of standard error between measured and predicted values by trial and error method. Momin (2011) in his dissertation study completed local calibration for north eastern United States including General Pavement Section (GPS) 1 and 2 experiments. The calibration parameters for flexible pavements were found through a mathematical process using 17 GPS sections from LTPP database. The process involved estimating the measured rut depth in each layer by finding the layer contribution to rutting using globally calibrated model ( =1.0 and =1.0,

=1.0). The measured and predicted values of rutting in each layer were used

simultaneously to obtain the local calibration parameters by performing a simple linear regression with no intercept, taking the measured value as the independent variable. The study didn't say anything about other two calibration parameters ( and ). An analysis suggested

that the local calibration coefficients give a better fit between measured and predicted permanent deformation in all layers. Kim et al. (2011) complied a report on Local Calibration of the MEPDG for Flexible Pavement Design to the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The study was performed with 46 sections among which 22 LTPP sections, 6 SPS and 16 GPS were used for calibration and 24 NCDOT PMS sections for validation. Two approaches, i.e., a generalized reduced gradient (GRG) approach and a genetic algorithm optimization (GAO) approach have been used to calibrate the rutting models for local conditions and materials. The GRG approach used 110 combinations of and to optimize , and for smallest RSS between the

predicted and measured distresses using Microsoft Excel Solver. The GAO approach used the MATLABÂ® environment to optimize for a single set of all five model coefficients and , , ,

simultaneously. The study suggested the results of GAO approach as local

calibration coefficients for North Carolina because of its better validation statistics.

36

Tareder et al. (2013) finished the local calibration for New Mexico using a flexible pavement database of New Mexico Department of Transportation. The project was based on the study of model's performance prediction to local condition using a total of 24 sections: 11 from LTPP pavement sections and 13 from PMS database. The calibration involved finding a set of calibration coefficients ( , , , and ) that minimizes the sum of squared error. The and (exponents to T and N)

analysis observed that the non-linear calibration coefficients

are highly sensitive to rutting. So, Tareder et al. (2013) proposed two step iterative process for calibration of rutting model. The first step is minimizing the RSS with different set of taking all other betas constant to 1, whereas, the second step utilizes the obtained values for further reduction of RSS by changing , and . and and

For Oregon, Williams and Shaidur (2013) calibrated rutting distress model using 44 rehabilitated pavements integrating from 3 regions, 5 pavement types, 2 traffic level and 3 level of pavement performance. The field condition distress surveys showed that most of the rutting is from the AC layers only. So, Williams and Shaidur (2013) proposed zero for calibration parameters of granular base and sub-grade layer. However, they proposed two steps iterative calibration approach for AC layer because of highly sensitivity nature of rutting to overlay properties. The first step concerned with finding the value of involved for estimation of and whereas the second step

by minimizing the RSS using Excel Solver.

For Colorado, Mallela et al. (2013) performed a study of MEPDG model for calibration and validation to local Colorado conditions. This was accomplished by using collectively 72 LTPP and 55 CDOT PMS database for new and rehabilitated pavement projects located throughout Colorado. The analysis showed that the globally calibrated models have significant bias in prediction of total rutting. So, Mallela et al. (2013) proposed an adjustment in rutting models by considering the information obtained through laboratory testing (RLPD test and HWT tests) and trench analysis. The calibration involved the use of non-linear model optimization function of SAS statistical software using laboratory-derived AC rutting model coefficients and ,

as seed values and simultaneously ensuring the contribution of each layers to rutting

without compromising goodness of fit and bias. Beside these, Donahue (2008) performed a study of local calibration of AC pavements by using MoDOT and LTPP database for Missouri. For New Jersey, verification of distress and 37

roughness of MEPDG was done by Siraj et al. (2008) with combination of LTPP and non-LTPP pavement sections. Hoegh et al. (2010) published an article about the local calibration of rutting model using historical rutting performance data of 12 test sections for MnDOT full-scale pavement. sections. Schram and Abdelrahman (2010) used PMS database of Nebraska for calibration and validation of distress models at the local project level. Similarly, Ahammed et al. (2011) worked for sensitivity of MEPDG with variation of truck traffic distributions, AADTT and axle load spectra using regional data on Manitoba pavement section. Calibration parameters of rutting model obtained from past local calibration studies in the USA are present in Table 2.10. Clearly, the previous calibration studies did not follow a same optimization procedure on local calibration practices. Some of these studies proposed a preset value for calibration parameter(s) from global calibration or/and regional default or/and pilot study, specifically , the global value for temperature exponent ( ) whereas some calibrated ) and . The

other calibration parameters largely fluctuate in each study.

2.6.3 Local Calibration Efforts in Canada Although, numerous studies were performed for calibration and validation of distress model in the USA, Canadian studies have been very few. The Ryerson group has been the major research group of local calibration in Canada. For Alberta, He et al. (2011) evaluated Darwin-ME pavement rutting prediction models using automatically collected pavement inventory and performance data from Alberta's PMS database. A unique network level approach was adopted to handle the rutting issue where the average rut depths of inventory sections are organized in 14 pavement groups within three category: five under the new construction category, four under the rehabilitation with milling category and five under the straight overlay category. These rut depths were compared with predicted rut depths against the pavement age for each group at the network level. The study found that DARWin-ME global rutting model over predict the total rutting for newly constructed flexible pavements, under predict for treated milling overlay pavements and closely predict for treated straight overlays pavements against the Alberta's local conditions. The findings from the study provide a general sense about the sensitivity of input parameter for future calibration of the rutting models in DARWin-ME for Canadian studies. Boone (2013) performed a comparative study of Ontario pavement designs using AASHTO 1993 method and MEPDG method. A two-stage procedure was used to evaluate a total of 140 Ontario's historical pavements designed by AASHTO 1993 method. The first stage was the pavements performance prediction using globally calibrated MEPDG distress models to determine the prediction consistency of the methods under local design conditions whereas the next step was comparison between methods based on the thickness of AC layers required to satisfy their respective design criteria. The analysis found that the MEPDG method generally under-predict pavement performance of flexible pavements w.r.t. AASHTO 1993 method and increase the cost of the design by increasing the AC layer thickness. So, Boone (2013) recommended recalibration and validation of the MEPDG models for Ontario conditions. Jannat (2012) was the first investigator who started a systematic study for Ontario's roads. Funded by an Highway Infrastructure Innovation Fund Program (HIIFP) project entitled Database Development for Ontario's local calibration of Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) distress models, Jannat's MASc dissertation research started with 5,555 pavement section cycles from Ontario's PMS-2 considering geographical regions, highway 39

types, facility types, number of lanes, lengths of section, rehabilitation type, and quality of performance to develop a unified high quality pavement database for local calibration. She introduced the term "section cycle" to define the life of a section from its construction or reconstruction or rehabilitation year to the next major rehabilitation year. In the end, she developed a database composing of 101 section cycles integrated with high quality section specific material, pavement performance and traffic data. While the project specific information (construction dates, locations, and site data) was retrieved from the MTO's contract documents, the pavement performance data (rutting and IRI) were developed from the Ministry's Pavement Management System (PMS) database. Because pavement cracking damage was qualitatively evaluated in the MTO until 2012 when the new ARAN system was deployed, the local calibration database did not include useful crack data. Meanwhile, the Ministry had also developed a MEPDG Default Input Parameters Guide (MTO 2012). Missing traffic, climate and environmental data, and material properties have been collected from that Guide as a Level 3 inputs. On the other hand, all of these sections, including both reconstructed and rehabilitated sections, are flexible pavements with asphalt concrete of Marshall mix. These all represent the limitations of the first local calibration database that was developed by the Ryerson Group. Based on the database developed, Jannat (2012) evaluated the MEPDG rutting models using 77 section cycles and concluded that the globally calibrated models generally over predict rutting for Ontario's roads. Some preliminary regression analyses based on road section, highway functional class, geographical region, AC layer properties and sub-grade modulus were carried out. It was suggested that highway functional class be the best clustering parameter for local calibration of rutting to Ontario's highways. Using the same database, Waseem (2013) performed a more rigorous local calibration study of the rutting models for the Ontario's flexible pavements. In his study, he selected 29 flexible pavement sections (10 reconstructed and 19 rehabilitated). The calibration process expected a unique optimum point for the calibration parameters by RSS minimization process; however, he found multiple local optima. This triggered his first attempt to determine the layer contribution of rutting in pavement structural layers. Hence, based on previous studies, Waseem (2013) proposed a set of layers contributions (for new/reconstructed pavement sections: 32% from AC, 59% from granular base and 9% from sub-grade soil and for rehabilitated pavement sections: 50% from AC layer and granular layer each) to the total rutting. 40

Further, he utilized preset layer contribution from different structural layers and used a two-stage layer-by-layer, section-by-section longitudinal local calibration methodology for the calibration of permanent deformation models to both reconstructed as well as rehabilitated pavement sections by using DARWin ME software. The first stage utilized a linear optimization to calibrate , and with exponential calibration parameters ( and ) at default

value of 1 while the second stage used a MATLAB environment for non linear optimization of only AC layer rutting parameters ( , and ), by minimizing the RSS of each individual

structural layer. The final result of the layer-by-layer, section-by-section longitudinal local calibration parameters obtained by Waseem (2013) are presented in the Table 2.11 and 2.12 below. The Section-by-Section longitudinal calibration provided large variation in the optimized local calibration coefficients. The average values of the five calibration parameters (for reconstructed sections: 0.290, 1.209, 0.810, 1.455 and 0.034 and for rehabilitated sections: 0.632, 1.203, 0.869, 1.152 and 0.000) were found to be inapplicable for future pavement design. Moreover, the cross-sectional calibration coefficients (for reconstructed sections: 0.30, 1.00, 1.00, 0.80 and 0.03 and for rehabilitated sections: 0.90, 1.23, 0.77, 0.985 and 0.00) were found to be very different than the averaged value of the longitudinal calibration results. Thus, several areas of further study were recommended in the end to enhance the local calibration of the rutting models for Ontario's flexible pavements.

2.6.4 Existing Local Calibration Methodologies Most of the previous calibration studies took the cross-sectional calibration, or pooled calibration approach in which all sections under the study area were analyzed jointly to propose a set of calibration parameters with a minimized RSS. The RSS is calculated by comparing the observed total rutting and the AASHTOWare predicted total rutting. Such approach suggested a set of regional average value of local calibration. In contrast, Waseem (2013) proposed site specific calibration parameters by a section-by-section calibration approach for Ontario's roads. However, the accuracy of the model depends on the approach of optimization to selection of final calibrated coefficient. The previous studies are summarized into the following four categories based on the approaches they used for optimization: 42

i) Studies used regional default values or historical performance data or laboratory findings to preset one or two local calibration parameters, whereas, the studies suggested to use their global default value in case of lack of information. Trial runs are conducted with multiple combinations of remaining calibration coefficients and a set of calibration coefficients are selected corresponding to minimum RSS (Banerjee et al. 2009). ii) Studies focused on finding a single set of all five model coefficients and , , ,

simultaneously through iteration process. Multiple combinations of calibration

coefficients are used as seed value for the analysis and final calibration coefficients are determined by using numerical optimization process such as MATLABÂ® or SAS statistical software (Darter et al. 2009). iii) Studies focused on two steps iterative process for calibration of rutting model. The first step is minimizing the RSS with different set of and taking all other betas and values for

constant to 1, whereas, the second step utilizes the obtained further reduction of RSS by changing (Tareder et al. 2013). , and

using Microsoft Excel Solver

iv) Studies utilized a preset value of layer contribution to rutting during two steps iterative process for calibration of rutting model. The first step is finding the calibration parameters of and by minimizing the RSS with different set of , and ,

whereas, the second step utilizes the MATLABÂ® environment for numerical optimization of , and in AC layer rutting model (Waseem 2013).

2.7 Concluding Remarks
Standing out as an emerging mainstream pavement design method throughout the North America, the MEPDG is still considered as unsuitable in predicting the performance of pavement for all locations. To implement the method in Ontario's conditions, local calibration is unavoidable. Waseem (2013) recently worked toward the local calibration of rutting models for Marshal mix pavements. Although, Superpave mix has since 2001 been almost exclusively used in Ontario's roads, it is still unknown whether a separate set of calibration parameters are required for Superpave pavements or not. This research contributes to calibrate the rutting model for Ontario's Superpave pavements. 43

The AASHTO local calibration guidelines and experiences of numerous transportation agencies throughout North America provide guidance for this study. Their calibration approaches serve for better understanding of adopted process and methodology. The knowledge from these calibration effort will be utilized during the calibration process of rutting models under this research. However, the literature review has clearly indicated that there has been no universally accepted local calibration method. Two major categories of approaches emerge from the divergent local calibration practice. The first approach leaves the optimization process to determine their values, while the other would prefix some of the local calibration parameters to a certain value before optimization and ask the RSS minimization to determine the others. Because of indeterminacy and interdependency between the models, the first approach blurs the nature of the problem that without layer contribution to rutting there would exist multiple optimum solutions. Indirect pilot studies have been attempted to determine the layer contribution, but in the absence of sample trench studies for Ontario's roads, the results were hard to validate. Meanwhile, the recent NCHRP 9-30A project published some reliable calibration results based on field performance and laboratory test data. These studies and data thereof may form a solid ground to prefix some of the local calibration parameters before the RSS minimization process. The next Chapter deals with the determination of the traffic and temperature exponents of the AC rutting model by studying the results from the NCHRP 9-30A project.

CHAPTER 3 TRAFFIC AND TEMPERATURE EXPONENTS
3.1 Introduction
As one can see in Chapter 2, different calibration procedures have been tried out in previous global and local calibration studies, resulting in very dissimilar optimal values of the local calibration parameters. Some researchers chose to prefix a certain local calibration parameters before the RSS minimization for probably two reasons: (1) The fewer optimization variables would reduce the numerical burden of the optimization iterations; (2) Some engineering experience may indicate a certain local calibration parameter to be a particular value. For example, Waseem (2013) prefixed for rehabilitated pavement sections on the ground

that subgrade soils in those sections have been sufficiently consolidated and no further significant permanent deformation will occur in relatively deep depth. This Chapter reports the result of a similar effort of determining a prior value of the temperature and traffic exponents ( by reviewing the calibration results in NCHRP Report 719. Report 719 (Von Quintus et al. 2012) summarizes the major research findings of NCHRP Project 9-30A. The project team focused on recalibration of the MEPDG AC rutting model by measuring its rutting property in both field and laboratory. The field test were performed through forensic investigations (e.g., trenches cutting, cores excavation, falling weight deflectometer deflection), whereas, repeated-load triaxial test and shear test were performed for laboratory test protocols. A total number of 60 field sections and 46 laboratory specimens were used in their calibration. For each of those sections, longitudinal calibration was performed and the plastic deformation coefficients of temperature and traffic terms, known as temperature exponent ( ) and traffic exponent ( ), respectively, were determined. The results of and )

field derived coefficients for new and rehabilitated pavement sections are replicated in Tables A1 and A-2. Similarly, the results of laboratory derived coefficient are replicated in Table A-3. In the following, a few simple statistical analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to determine a proper value for the subsequent local calibration study for Ontario's roads.

45

3.2 The Traffic Exponent
In order to determine a proper prefixed traffic exponent ( have to be tested at first: (1) H1: The new and rehabilitated pavement sections share the same traffic exponent value. (2) H2: The field- and laboratory-derived traffic exponents are the same. (3) H3: Material testing protocols do not affect the traffic exponent. To test these hypotheses, t-tests are performed. Table 3.1: Test statistics between observed traffic exponents under NCHRP Project 9-30A Hypothesis H1 H2 H3 Test data Table A1 vs. A2 Table (A1+A2) vs. A3 (TT) Table (A1+A2) vs. A3 (ST) Table A3 (TT and ST) Statistic and degrees of freedom 0.322 (n = 39) 4.744 (n = 52) 0.187 (n = 37) 3.323 (n = 39) p value 0.374 8.36E-0.6 0.426 0.001 ) value, three hypotheses

The number of t-tests analysis are done during this research by using the field and laboratory derived traffic exponent under NCHRP Project 9-30A. For the first test, it was hypothesized that there is no significant difference between derived mean value for new and rehabilitated sections. The calculated t-value for field derived traffic exponent between new and rehabilitated sections is 0.322 which accepts the null hypothesis. Hence, there is no need to separate the traffic exponent for new and rehabilitated sections as mentioned by Waseem (2013). Similarly, t-test analysis is performed to identify the feasibility of direct use of repeatedload triaxial and shear test for calibration of AC layer rutting model. It is observed that there is no difference in traffic exponent from field derived and repeated-load shear test (t value = 0.187), whereas significant difference from repeated-load triaxial test (t value = 4.744). Further, a large difference is observed in traffic exponent between data collected by repeated-load triaxial test (TT) and shear test (ST). Due to such observation, further t-test analysis is performed to identify the difference between mean value of traffic exponent from these test protocols. The test verifies that there is a significant difference (t value = 3.323) in traffic exponent by material testing 46

protocols. These test results guided that the mean traffic exponent value from repeated-load plastic deformation shear tests can be directly used as a level-2 input for the calibration of rutting model. But, repeated-load plastic deformation shear tests are usually not performed not only because of time limitation, but also of the test apparatus and protocol limitations. A further sensitivity analysis was carried out to check the overall impact of the traffic exponent (m) on rutting prediction. For this purpose, the total rutting of 12 Ontario Superpave sections are predicted at different value of m ranging from 0.11 to 0.57, with the local calibration coefficient correspondingly being 0.2296 to 1.1897. The comparison between the predicted

rutting with different value of m for these typical Superpave pavement sections are shown in Figure 3.1. An ANOVA analysis as presented in Table 3.2 and 3.3 found that the value of traffic exponent is insensitive within its global value of 0.48, but highly sensitive beyond this value. The reason for such a variation is indistinct and need further intensive study.

On the other hand, some models (e.g., the modified Leahy model and the Verstraeten model) used m-value of 0.25. Also, a histogram plotted from the results of field and laboratory derived traffic exponent concentrated to an average value of 0.30 with standard deviation of 0.08 as presented in Figure 3.2. Further, NCHRP Report 719 demonstrated no significant evidence for different m for new and rehabilitated sections and concluded that the current global coefficient for traffic exponent seems to be too large. Thus, under these circumstances, the traffic exponent is fixed to a value of 0.30 as level 3 input for this research.

3.3 Temperature Exponent
Among the alternative rutting models, only the MEPDG model and the Asphalt Institute (AI) model include a temperature term. The AI model used a temperature exponent (n) of 2.767 whereas the value is 1.5606 for MEPDG model. Report 719 concludes that the laboratoryderived temperature exponent (Refer to Table A.3 for the replicated data) are highly dependent upon the material testing methods. The histograms of the triaxial and shear loading test data are depicted in Figure 3.3. While the mean exponent of the triaxial test is 2.665, that of the repeated load shear test is 7.720, more than doubled. Moreover, most of the past local calibration studies as reviewed in Section 2.6 simply used its global value. For these reasons, this study also chose to fix the temperature exponent at its global value of 1.5606. That is, the local calibration coefficient
10

is preset to 1.0 in this local calibration study.

3.4 Concluding Remarks
The global value of temperature exponent (n) of the AC rutting model in the MEPDG based on the NCHRP 1-40D is 1.5606. A recent research by Waseem (2013) found this value ranging from 1.459 to 2.712 for Ontario's Marshall mix design, whereas NCHRP Project 9-30A found its laboratory derived values to lie between 1.200 to 4.25. Also, the study of the effect of temperature on plastic deformation coefficients by NCHRP Project 9-30A team found this value around 1.0 and slightly less for high quality of material. This large variation and contradictory observations of temperature exponent blurs the issue and the solution becomes vague. The author 49

believes that an intensive study of temperature exponent be required to settle down this issue. For this study, the coefficient is pragmatically fixed to 1.5606 . That is, is preset to 1.0.

On the contrary, the traffic exponent has shown much smaller variation in the global and local calibration studies. The global value of traffic exponent (m) for MEPDG rutting model based on the NCHRP 1-40D is 0.4791. Waseem (2013) found this value ranging from 0.11 to 0.57 for Ontario's Marshall mix design, whereas NCHRP Project 9-30A team found this value between 0.16 to 0.55 with an average of 0.30 and standard deviation of 0.08. This statistical result showed that the current global coefficient for traffic exponent seems to be too large. The statistical analysis of the Project 9-30A data also confirmed that the field- and laboratory-derived traffic exponents for new and rehabilitated sections can be considered to come from the same population and thus there is no need to separately treat the new and rehabilitated sections in local calibration. Moreover, a pilot sensitivity study shows that the value has little effects on rutting prediction if the range is confined to be within 0.11 Â­ 0.35. Therefore, this study chose to preset the value at 0.30 (or ) for the local calibration, while using 0.11 to 0.57 for

sensitivity studies.

CHAPTER 4 LOCAL CALIBRATION METHODS
4.1 Guiding Principle
This chapter discusses the two local calibration methods that are used in this study. As discussed in Chapter 2, the MEPDG method includes three empirical rutting models (c.f., equations 2.7 and 2.8) for asphalt concrete, granular base/sub-base materials, and sub-grade soils, respectively. These models altogether contain five calibration coefficients ( granular base/sub-base, and , for AC, for

for sub-grade soils). As discussed in Chapter 3, to reduce the and ) have been

indeterminacy of the optimization process, the two exponent coefficients (

prefixed to some specific values. Therefore, the local calibration optimization aims to determine the three scale coefficients ( ) with the following two objectives: (1) minimize bias

and (2) minimize the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). These two objectives are usually compatible because any additional bias will increase the RSS. In ideal case, the RSS is minimized only if the bias is eliminated. However, the natural constraint that the three scale coefficients must be nonnegative sometimes cannot ensure that the bias be eliminated when the RSS is minimized. The residual in the term RSS is defined as the difference between the observed or measured rut depth that is available from the PMS database (Details are explained in Chapter 5) and the MEPDG-predicted total rut depth at the same measurement or inspection time. The RSS and bias are expressed as, respectively, (4-1a) (4-2b)

where:

= total number of rut depth measurements in the calibration set; = observed total rut depth; = calculated total rut depth as given in equation (4-2), which is a function of the five local calibration parameters; (4-3) 51

= calculated total rut depth of AC layer, which is a function of the three local calibration parameters , . . .

= calculated total rut depth of granular base layer, a function of = calculated total rut depth of sub-grade layer, a function of

Based on the previous discussion on Chapter 3, a preset value for temperature exponent (n) and traffic exponent (m) are suggested as 1.5606 and 0.30, respectively, in the following study. This fixes the local calibration parameters Since the calibration parameters , and and as 1.0 and 0.6262 respectively.

all are direct multipliers of the rutting models,

one can estimate the rut depth for each structural layer by using the rutting models with =1 and and =1, and = 0.6262. Denote so estimated rut depths by ,

=1,

for the AC, granular base/sub-base, and sub-grade soil layers, respectively. Then Eq.

(4-2) can be rewritten as (4-3) If RSS is the only objective function of the local calibration, then it can be readily shown that the three scale parameters can be solved from the following simultaneous linear equations, which are derived from the simple least square principle: (4-4) (4-5) (4-6)

Unfortunately, some testing calibrations suggested that this simple least square solution sometimes led to negative values for the three parameters. Therefore, additional constraints should be added to the minimization process and the other objective: minimization of the absolute value of the bias has to be introduced. In the end, the local calibration problem is formulated as the following two-objective constrained optimization problem: min s.t. 52 RSS and Bias

To solve this problem, the author realize that the best feasible solution is the trial and error method to reach a minimum RSS value. A number of trial run are conducted with multiple combination of calibration coefficients , and using the semi-automated local

calibration procedure developed by Waseem (2013) in Excel Macros. A set of calibration coefficients are selected corresponding to minimum RSS. Some random spot checks are done to confirm the optimization before selecting optimal solution by varying , and with few

neighbouring values. Finally, the results from this method are validated and compared with global calibration efforts.

4.2 Cross-sectional Calibration and Longitudinal Calibration
This study proposes two different local calibration methods: the cross-sectional calibration and longitudinal calibration. In the first type of model calibration, the rut depth measurements from the calibration sections are pooled together for the local calibration. An advantage of the crosssection calibration, or pooled calibration as Waseem (2013) named it, is that it allows to use as many sections as possible in the minimization process to obtain a single set of local calibration parameters. Therefore, The cross-sectional study does not require long-time rut records for any specific sections. However, the data quality requirement is not less constrained. To avoid the high fluctuation on the observed rut depth along the service life of the pavement and for the consistency consideration, only the last rut depth measurements of the calibration sections in the year 2012 are used for cross-sectional calibration. In the longitudinal calibration, each calibration section is treated as a calibration object for which the minimization process is performed to obtain a section-specific set of local calibration coefficients. Therefore, only those sections with a relatively long series of rut records (say, at least 3 years) were calibrated. Unfortunately, the magnitude of field observed rut depth data retrieved from the MTO's PMS database fluctuate with high variability along the service life of the pavement. This has greatly limited the number of pavement sections that can be used in the longitudinal study. It is important to understand that the equal weight is given for each observed rut depth during the both type of model calibration. On the other side, the predicted rut data are estimated using rutting models within the AASHTOWare pavement design software environment. This 53

requires the detailed input and level of accuracy of the sections as described in Chapter 5. Input and its level significantly contributes towards total standard error. However, this research completely relied on the already available database and no additional tests were performed to upgrade the input level. Figure 4.2 is presented here to elaborate the example of longitudinal calibration methodology.

Figure 4.1: Typical example for longitudinal calibration methodology The cross-sectional calibration approach is easy for data management, analysis and adaptation for further pavement design, in contract to the longitudinal calibration approach. However, the results are less precise. In the longitudinal calibration, model development for precise estimation of calibration parameters for specific pavement section is always the challenging part during design and maintenance practices.

4.3 Validation Methods
The calibration results from cross-sectional and longitudinal calibration methods are verified separately. For the cross-sectional validation, the optimized calibration parameters are used on 35% of selected pavement sections to predict the total rut depth. Finally, the statistical analysis is performed to test the variance of the residual error between the calibration and validation sets at a significant level of 5%. For longitudinal approach, each calibrated sections are individually verified with the latest rut depth measurements.

CHAPTER 5 CALIBRATION DATABASE
5.1 Data Requirement for Local Calibration
Basically, two types of data are required for local calibration to rutting models: observed rut depth data and pavement analysis input data for the prediction of rut depth of selected pavement sections. The observed data are retrieved from the MTO's database and integrated into the calibration database through screening and selection process. The predicted rut data are estimated using rutting models that are to be locally calibrated by simulating the existing field pavement condition within the AASHTOWare pavement design software. This requires the detailed input and level of accuracy of selected road sections. The major inputs for the evaluation of pavement rutting in the AASHTOWare include: i) General project information ii) Traffic data iii) Climate data iv) Pavement material and structural data The details of the data are discussed in details in the following. But before this, the pavement sections selected for the calibration study is described at first.

5.2 Accuracy of Input Data
Based on the availability of resources, input data for traffic and materials are classified in three levels of accuracy as described below. AASHTOWare pavement design software provides flexibility to make a choice of level of accuracy of input data depending on the importance of the project. This research utilizes the highest level of inputs as far as available. Level 1: This level of inputs represents highest level of accuracy and obtained directly from specific site measurements, laboratory observations and actual field testing results. However, these inputs require expensive experimentation and, hence, used for the projects having high economical risks. Generally, dynamic modulus, resilient modulus, AADTT, lane number, growth factor, etc. are used for this level. 55

Level 2: This level of inputs represents intermediate level of accuracy and obtained from mathematical correlations or regression equations. Regional default values established by local authority also represent level 2 input. Some examples of level 2 data are resilient modulus estimated from CBR values, axle configuration, truck vehicle classification, etc. and are used whenever project or site specific values are not available. Level 3: This level of inputs represents lowest level of accuracy and estimated based on the experiences. Regional and global default values also represent level 3 input. As far, this level of inputs are avoided for the design practices, however, can be used for low volume roads.

5.3 Sample Selection
The Province of Ontario has more than 16,500 lane-km paved roads segmented into about 1,800 pavement sections under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) (Li et al. 2008). Among them, the majority are flexible pavements. Studying all of the flexible sections for the rutting model calibration is neither possible (because of time and cost limitation) nor necessary. However, there is a minimum number of pavement sections (sample size) that a local calibration study needs so that the results can be statistically generalized without biasing the findings. The Guide for the Local Calibration of the Mechanical-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (AASHTO 2010) recommends a minimum number of 20 pavement sections for total rutting study at a significance level of 90%. The guide further suggests a fractional balance factorial of the key factors such as climatic zone (geographical regions), pavement types (new and rehabilitated sections), truck traffic application (highway type), etc. when selecting the roadway sections for the study. This recommendations are considered in this research study. MTO started to introduce Superpave in the year of 2001. As of 2012, there have been in total 87 projects that used Superpave mix in the top asphalt layer(s), which amounts to 140 sections. These projects have different pavement structures and highway types, spreading over all of the five climatic zone of Ontario as shown in Figure 5.1. Preliminarily, 133 pavement sections are selected excluding the secondary highway because of its small sample size. A total of 31 SMA and widening sections are also removed. The remaining 102 sections are further processed 56

for the cross-sectional calibration. However, only 84 sections are viable for cross-sectional calibration because of lack of trustable structural and/or material information. For longitudinal calibration purpose, further screening of the 84 sections are performed based on the quality of the observed rut depth data. In this regard, the pavement sections with service life of more than 3 years are selected to ensure that a realistic trend of rut progression can be established and observed. Finally 33 sections from 22 roadway segments are selected for the longitudinal local calibration purpose as shown in Figure 5.2. For these selected pavement sections, the input data are collected, verified and combined with assistance from MTO staff to create a unified database for the use of local calibration. The details of the selected sections are presented in Table B-1 to B-5.

5.4 Major Input Variables for MEPDG
A typical design in MEPDG required numerous inputs related to material, traffic and climate for the AASHTOWare pavement design analysis. The input requirements during local calibration of new, reconstructed and rehabilitated flexible pavement sections are discussed below. 5.4.1 General Project Information In AASHTOWare pavement design software, project related inputs regarding some general information, design criteria and project identifiers are required as in Table 5.1. The general information includes the life, type and history of the pavement section where as project identifiers represents the identity of the pavement section under consideration. These information are collected from MTO database for each pavement sections. However, limiting value of predicted distress corresponding to 50 % reliability recommended in Ontario's default parameters for AASHTOWare pavement ME design interim report 2012 are taken as input data under design criteria for local calibration.

5.4.2 Traffic Data The AASHTOWare incorporate traffic inputs under 6 main groups as presented in Table 5.2. The site specific traffic data are mostly preferred for the analysis. However, site-related, regional or agency-wide or AASHTOWare default traffic parameters can be used in some specific cases. For this study, MTO database, Ontario's default parameters for AASHTOWare pavement ME design interim report 2012, AASHTOWare default values are taken as key sources for traffic input for each pavement sections during local calibration. Traffic information for selected pavement sections are presented in Tables C-15 to C-20. Table 5.2: Summary of traffic input requirements and the accuracy level used in this study

Note: MOP - Manual of Practice 5.4.3 Climatic Data Local weather conditions such as temperature, precipitation, season and depth of water table acts as a phenomenon of producing extreme long term distresses that significantly affect the pavement performance. As a result, estimation of local climate conditions are essential to predict the distribution of temperature and moisture in the pavement structure that are highly sensitive to AC and unbound material stiffness respectively. The AASHTOWare uses the observed location parameters in the Integrated Climatic Model (ICM) to obtain the local climatic data (mean annual air temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean monthly temperatures, number of wet days, freezing index and average number of freeze/thaw cycles) from a library of more than 800 weather stations throughout USA and Canada. Table D-1 presents the Ontario's 34 weather stations that are included in AASHTOWare pavement design software. In AASHTOWare, location parameters and ground water related information are required for climatic data inputs as shown in Table 5.3. The location parameters include the latitude, longitude and elevation of the pavement sections under consideration as shown in Table D-2 to D-7, for which the site specific information are collected from Google maps. However, a regional default value of 6.1 m is used for the depth of ground water table (GWT). Table 5.3: Climate input requirement used for AASHTOWare in this study

5.4.4 Pavement Material and Structural Data A typical flexible pavement is designed in two types of structural layers, known as AC layer and unbound (granular and fine) layer by using different types of material. AC layer mainly uses Superpave, stone matrix asphalt (SMA), Marshall mix and asphalt stabilized material, whereas, Granular materials, chemically stabilized base materials and fine sub-grade soil are used for unbound layer in Ontario's roads, which are presented in Tables E-7 to E-11. The AASHTOWare needs material properties of the pavement layers for mechanistic analysis to obtain the pavement responses and distresses under local condition. The material inputs are categorized into 5 main groups for AC layer and 3 groups for unbound layer, as presented in Tables 5.4 and 5.5, respectively. In terms of the accuracy level, the Level 1 (project specific) material properties are preferred. However, many properties such as aggregate gradation, air voids, binder content are difficult, but not impossible to obtain or retrieve. For this reason and to facilitate the local calibration, the MTO has developed a guide document that specifies the default values for those parameters that are not easy to obtain their project-specific values (MTO 2012).

5.5 Calibration Database
In Canada, Jannat (2012) was the first person who worked on development of calibration database during her MASc requirement. She used 5555 pavement section cycles (the life of a section from its construction or reconstruction or rehabilitation year to the next major rehabilitation year) from Ontario's PMS-2 considering geographical regions, highway types, facility types, number of lanes, lengths of section, rehabilitation type and quality of performance and finally, she developed a unified high quality pavement database of 101 section cycles for local calibration. The developed database was further used by Waseem (2013), a member of Ryerson group led by Professor Yuan, during local calibration study to the Ontario's Marshall mix sections. This study differ from the study of Waseem (2013) in terms of AC layer(s) material and methodology. The study mainly focus on the local calibration of MEPDG rutting models for Ontario's Superpave sections and the required database is developed during the study. However, the database developed by Jannat (2012) and used by Waseem (2013) are also used in this study to see the reliability of developed new methodology to the Marshall mix sections.

5.6 Summary
This chapter discussed the details of three major categories of input data (i.e., traffic, climate and materials) requirement and their hierarchical level used for local calibration of pavement sections in Ontario. Pavement sections for local calibration were selected by screening based on the quality of historical pavement performance data retrieved from the MTO database. For all the selected sections, performance data including section name, route name, route direction, station beginning mile, station end mile, facility type, functional class, AADTT, subgrade modulus, axle configuration, vehicle class, materials properties etc. were collected and compiled to the proper format for the use of local calibration. Latitude, longitude and elevation for specific section are collected from google map and complied accordingly in to the data file. Finally, these integrated data will be used for pavement analysis as discussed in the following local calibration studies.

CHAPTER 6

CROSS-SECTIONAL CALIBRATION

6.1 Calibration and Validation Results
6.1.1 Results for Superpave Sections The rutting models for Superpave sections are calibrated by using local calibration methodology as described in Chapter 4. The cross-sectional calibrations was performed on fifty three Ontario's Superpave pavement sections by comparing the observed and predicted rut depth in the year 2012. The total RSS was minimized at = 2.692, = 0.000 and = 0.185 with standard

error of 1.200 mm and a bias of 0.086 mm, yielding an average layer contribution of 31.21%, 0.00% and 68.79% for AC, base and sub-grade layer respectively. Meanwhile, the observed total pavement rutting is plotted against the corresponding predicted values as shown in Figure 6.1a which showed a poor correlation (0.350) between them. However, the obtained calibration parameters are further used to the 31 Superpave sections (refer Figure 6.2b) that results in a standard error of 1.193 mm and a bias of 0.151 mm. An F-test for the residual error was performed among these calibration and validation sets. The test result is presented in Table 6.1, where the ratio of variance (F=1.02) is less than F critical (F critical=1.76) at a significance level of 5%. Thus, the null hypothesis of no significant difference between the residual error of calibration and validation sets is accepted.

Although it shows extremely poor correlation (0.350), the overall standard error of 1.200 mm (refer to Figure 6.1a) is better than the result from the global calibration. However, the observation of small R2 value pointed toward a need to consider the weighted on the observed rutting with the age of the pavement during the calibration.

6.1.2 Results for Marshall Mix Sections The cross-sectional calibration methodology was applied to Ontario's Marshall mix pavement sections taken by the Waseem (2013) considering the rut depth measured in the year 2009 and 2010 using preset value of local calibration parameters for temperature exponent ( and traffic exponent ( )

). Most of these Marshall mix sections under gone for the rehabilitated

process after year 2010 and have no information about the structural layer. Thus, the latest rut observation in the year 2012 could not be used for the analysis as done in Superpave sections. The analysis was performed on 19 Marshall mix pavement sections with a preset value of 1.000 and 0.6262 for local calibration parameters of temperature exponent ( exponent ( ) respectively. The total RSS was minimized at = 3.449, ) and traffic =

= 1.207 and

0.058 resulting an average layer contribution of 21.53%, 68.98% and 9.49% for AC, base and sub-grade layer respectively. Meanwhile, the observed total pavement rutting is plotted against the corresponding predicted values as shown in Figure 6.3a which showed a poor correlation (0.521) between them with a standard error of 2.208 and a bias of 0.202 mm. However, the obtained calibration parameters are further used to 10 Marshall mix sections that results in a standard error of 2.495 mm and a bias of 0.329 mm (refer to Figure 6.3b). A Ftest for the residual error was performed among these calibration and validation sets. The test result is presented in Table 6.2, where the ratio of variance (F = 1.26) is less than F critical (F critical = 2.46). Thus, the null hypothesis of no significant difference between residual error of calibration and validation sets is accepted.

On the other side, it shows poor correlation (0.521) that is expected to improve by considering the weighted on the observed rutting with the age of the pavement during the calibration. However, the standard error of 2.208 (refer to Figure 6.3a) is better than the result from the global calibration.

6.1.3 Discussions The local calibration coefficients for Superpave sections = 2.692, = 0.000 and =

0.185 with corresponding average layer contribution of 31.21%, 0.00% and 68.79% and Marshall mix sections = 3.449, = 1.207 and = 0.058 with corresponding average layer

contribution of 21.53%, 68.98% and 9.42% shows a great variation between these two mix type, which is expected because of difference in the performance behavior to rutting by the pavement materials. The superior performance of the Superpave section provides a long term protection to the underneath granular base/ sub-base layer which is relatively poor in Marshall mix type. Despite of these large variation in calibration coefficient and layer contribution, all Superpave and Marshall sections are collectively recalibrated to see the possibility of use of a single model for these two materials. The total RSS was minimized at and = 2.701, = 0.198

= 0.215, yielding corresponding average layer contribution of 23.76%, 18.02% and

58.21% and a standard error of 2.396 mm and a bias of 0.078 mm. The recalibration results are almost similar to the result of Superpave sections because of its large sample size in compare to Marshall mix sections. But on the other side, the standard error is increased. Meanwhile, the cross-sectional calibration results obtained for Ontario's Superpave and Marshall mix pavement sections are also compared with the global calibration results in terms of the standard error as shown in Table 6.3. Although the cross-sectional calibration bear very poor correlation between the predicted and observed rutting, the resulting overall standard error is lower than that from the global calibration which indicates the improvement in the performance of the models. It is noted that all three models have a bias of almost zero and a standard error of lower than from global calibration, all these models can be used for Ontario's pavement design. However, the use of separate models for Superpave and Marshall mix sections are considered as efficient and precise model for Ontario's condition.

As the observed rut trend along the pavement age is different for different mix type including Superpave and Marshall type (refer to chapter 1.1), it is important to see whether crosssectional calibration can capture this longitudinal trend of rutting or not. Thus, the model coefficients from cross-sectional calibration results are further used on typical selected Superpave and Marshall sections to predict the longitudinal rutting trend. The comparison of observed and predicted rutting is shown in the Figure 6.5 and 6.6. The two major conclusions are made from this study. One is that the cross-sectional calibration fails to capture the longitudinal trend of evolution of rutting and the bias increases with pavement age. The next is that the separate model coefficients clustering by pavement mix type are more precise than the combined model coefficients for estimate of the longitudinal trend. This issue can be addressed either by considering the weighted value of observed rut depth along the pavement age or/and by longitudinal calibration. In this research, longitudinal approach of model calibration is discussed in the later chapter.

6.2 Clustering Analysis
As discussed in section 6.1.3, the cluster analysis by pavement mix type may improve the performance of the model. Thus, the author of this research is interested for further cluster analysis in order to improve the standard error and goodness of fit. The cross-sectional calibration methodology was applied to Ontario's flexible pavements in different cluster groups to evaluate the prediction performance of the models in terms of standard error.

6.2.2 Cluster Analysis for Marshall Mix Sections As described above, the cross-sectional calibration methodology was used on 19 Ontario's Marshall mix pavement sections in different cluster groups for recalibration by comparing the observed and predicted rut depth in the year 2009 and 2010. The summary of the results are presented in the Table 6.5, which shows a significant improvement in the prediction performance of the rutting models in Ontario's highway. However, we observed a large variation on the layer contribution to the rutting specially by Ontario zone, but the base layer remains as the major contributor as obtained in non-cluster calibration.

6.3 Concluding Remarks
A separate cluster, non-cluster and combined cross-calibration to both Superpave and Marshall mix sections give some concrete results about the performance efficiency of the model. One of the important finding is that it is unrealistic to use a single model for both materials for Ontario's condition. Secondly, cluster calibration based on top layer material and its performance grade improves the Superpave rutting models whereas the models for Marshall mix are improved by Ontario zone and sub-grade modulus. Thus, it establishes the need of more sophisticated cluster analysis. Further, the simple cross-sectional calibration is not sufficient to capture the longitudinal trend of rutting and the nature of the residual error consistently changes from a certain value of total rut depth. To address this issue, the model need to be recalibrated by considering the weighted on the observed rutting with the age of the pavement. A summary of the cross-sectional results for Marshall mix sections by Waseem (2013) is presented in the Table 6.6 for the purpose of comparison with cluster and non-cluster calibration. A large variation in the calibration parameters is observed that is believed to cause due to specific issues (c.f. layer contribution to rutting, temperature and traffic exponent) involved in local calibration method which are still unknown to the Ontario's roads. Despite of this large variation, the model developed by non-cluster calibration has almost same precision as developed 72

by Waseem for Ontario condition. However, the models developed by cluster analysis in this research are more precise among all these models. Thus, this observation also confirms a need of more sophisticated cluster analysis in the local calibration practices. The most optimal cluster analysis in the local calibration study are calibrating the individual pavement section having a relatively long series of rut records, thus the study is a section-by-section longitudinal calibration. The following chapter discuss the details of longitudinal calibration methodology. Table 6.6: Comparison of cross-sectional calibration results for Marshall mix sections

CHAPTER 7 LONGITUDINAL CALIBRATION
7.1 Characterization of Rut Depth
Local calibration compares the predicted rut depth against the observed rut depth. In this study, the field observed rut depth data are retrieved from the MTO's database. The database consists of a series of ARAN rut depth data for each pavements measured by MTO staff. However, the magnitude of these data randomly fluctuate with high variability. On the other side, the quality of observed rut depth affects the overall accuracy of the design. Hence, the author realized the need of screening the pavement sections before selecting and integrating into the calibration database. The observed rutting data for each pavement section included in the study were reviewed through visual inspections. Screening was done based on the quality of pavement performance and observed number of rutting data points as explained in section 5.3. Any zeros in the observed rut in between the pavement service life was removed and deemed to be no observation at that point. Measurements on rehabilitation year were carefully considered as either the first reading of the next cycle or the last reading of the ongoing cycle. The observed rutting data were used in two ways during previous local calibration studies. Some researchers suggested to use smoothed observed rutting data to minimize the magnitude of residual error. In contract, other researchers emphasized the use of unmodified observed rutting data to simplify the local calibration procedure from variance associated with smoothed data. A study conducted by Waseem (2013) also found smaller RSS value for smoothed rut data as compared to the original rut data. However, his study found no effect in final selection of local calibration parameters. Considering that the smoothing of the observed rutting data would distort the estimation of the standard error in the local calibration, this study used the original observed rut data for the calibration purpose. The predicted rut data are estimated using rutting models within the AASHTOWare pavement design software version 2.1. This requires the detailed input and level of accuracy of selected road sections as described in chapter 5.

7.2 Results for Superpave Sections
7.2.1 Calibration Results The section-by-section, longitudinal local calibration methodology as described in Chapter 4 was employed for the 33 flexible pavement sections to calibrate the five local calibration parameters in the three rutting models. As discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, a preset value of 1.0 and 0.6262 were used for the temperature exponent ( ) and traffic exponent ( ), respectively. The RSS

minimization process is followed to obtain the other three parameters. The obtained optimum values of , and for the 33 sections are listed together with the corresponding RSS,

bias and percentage of layer contribution in Table 7.1. Table 7.1: Longitudinal calibration results for the Superpave sections (with and )

7.2.2 Discussions The optimized calibration parameters are consistently varying from one section to the other; in specific, the AC scaling parameter ( ( ) varies from 1.801 to 4.300, the granular base parameter ) varied from 0.013 to 0.137. The

) from 0.185 to 2.137 and the fine soil parameters (

layer contribution by AC layer, granular base layer and fine soil layer after calibration also seems to be consistent with small variation resulting an average value of about 28.56%, 51.63% and 19.81% respectively. However, the fine soil scaling parameters ( ) of section 80, 477 and 613 is relatively in

higher range whereas this value goes to the lower range for sections 197, 206 and 334 in compare to other sections. The reason for such a variation in the value of fine soil scaling parameters ( is indistinct and need further study. Similarly, granular base scaling parameters ( )

) for sections

1297 and 1301 are 2.137 and 1.657 respectively representing high value as compared to other sections. This higher end values for these sections are due to a layer of 100 mm cement treated OGDL (Open graded drainage layer), which provides a long term protection to the underneath granular layer. Also, this value is 1.549 and 1.401 to the sections 78 and 79 respectively because of the presence of 150 mm old asphalt layer. The section 477 also has a higher end value of 1.211 as a result 75 mm asphalt stabilized CIR (cold in-place recycling) material. On the other side, due to the influence of thin AC layer, sections 574, 575, 576, 577 and 578 has the lowest values for granular base scaling parameters ( ) ranging in between 0.185 to 0.201 as shown in Table 7.1.

Further, these sections are grouped together by projects. Despite of large variation in the calibration coefficients from one section to another, the calibration coefficients of the sections within a project are almost similar. Meanwhile, the observed total pavement rutting is plotted against the corresponding predicted values as shown in Figure 7.2 which showed a good correlation (0.804) between them with a standard error of 0.524 mm. The local calibration results small RSS for all the sections except sections 80, 323, 577, 578 and 1240. This large RSS is contributed due to a large fluctuation of observed rut depth in between the service life of the pavement sections.

Next, the optimum average values for the three calibration parameters of all are , and

. The reason for variation in local calibration parameters is not clear

and need further intensive study. However, the changes are project specific and governed by pavement material properties and structure. The use of an average values of these three calibration parameters results a standard error of which is as good as to the result from the ) with a bias of

global calibration. However, it shows a very poor correlation (

. Hence, these average values will be appropriate as level 3 input for Ontario. 7.2.3 Validation Ontario's thirty three Superpave pavement sections were calibrated by section-by-section longitudinal local calibrations methodology with a preset value of 1.000 and 0.6262 for local calibration parameters of temperature exponent ( ) and traffic exponent ( ) respectively and

the results was presented in Table 7.1. The calibration process utilized the field observed rut depth data from MTO's database that consist of a series of rut depth data for each pavements by the end of year 2012. But after calibration, MTO staff provide the rut depth data for the year 2013 and 2014. Hence, the author decided to apply the most recent data of all 33 sections for validation purposes during this study. 81

Sections having no observation in the year 2013 or/and 2014 are carefully removed from the analysis. Thus, sections 156, 613 and 835 are removed from validation process because of lack of rut data in the database. Finally, the calibration results presented in Table 7.1 are utilized on all 30 sections to compare the predicted rut depth against its measured value during the year 2013 and 2014. Meanwhile, a plot between the observed total pavement rutting and the corresponding predicted values (refer to Figure 7.3) bears relatively low correlation (0.731) between them with a standard error of 0.958 mm, the resulting overall standard error is actually as good as to the result from the global calibration, as shown in Table 7.8.

The histogram for the local calibration coefficients for all three scenarios are presented in the Figure 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8. It is clear that the value of local calibration coefficient for AC layer, base layer and sub-grade layer decreases with increase in traffic exponent value (refer to Figure 7.9). However, the average layer contribution of AC layer increases with the increase in the traffic exponent value, but the contribution decreases for base and sub-grade layer (refer to Figure 7.10). 87

7.4 Results of Marshall Mix Sections
Similar longitudinal calibration is done to the 29 Marshall mix sections selected by Waseem (2013). Waseem (2013) already did a longitudinal calibration. But his methodology was slightly different than this. In this study, the traffic and temperature exponents are pre-fixed, as explained earlier, whereas in Waseem's study all of the five parameters are determined under a pre assumed layer contribution distribution. A set of sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the robustness of the local calibration results at different values of or . For all of the

following analyses, the temperature exponent is kept to be 1.0, with reasons already explained in Chapter 3.

Next, the average values of the three optimum calibration parameters of the 29 sections are 2.723, 1.036 and 0.248, respectively. The reason for variation in local calibration parameters is not clear and need further intensive study. However, using an average values of these three calibration parameters results a standard error of 2.392 mm, an average bias of -0.993 and R2 = 0.732 which is as good as to the result from the global calibration. Hence, these average values will be appropriate as level 3 input for Ontario. 7.4.2 Local Calibration Parameters for m=0.479 Similarly, At or , the optimum values of , and through the RSS

minimization process are presented in Table 7.6. The observed total pavement rutting is plotted against the corresponding predicted values as shown in Figure 7.12 which showed a good 90

correlation (0.970) between them with a standard error of 0.437 mm. The average values of the three optimum calibration parameters of the 29 sections are 0.259, 1.458 and 0.060, respectively.

The histogram of the local calibration coefficients for two different scenarios are presented in the Figure 7.13, and 7.14. It is clear that the value of local calibration coefficient for AC layer and the sub-grade layer decreases with increase in traffic exponent value whereas it increases with increase in traffic exponent for the base layer (refer to Figure 7.15). However, the average layer contribution of AC and base layer increases with the increase in the traffic exponent value, but the contribution of sub-grade layer decreases (refer to Figure 7.16).

Figure 7.16: Variation of layer contribution with section specific calibration coefficients 7.4.4 Validation for Local Calibration Results Ontario's twenty nine Marshall mix pavement sections were calibrated by section-by-section longitudinal local calibrations methodology with a preset value of 1.0 and 0.6262 for local calibration parameters of temperature exponent ( ) and traffic exponent ( ) respectively and

the results was presented in Table 7.5. The most of these Marshall mix sections under gone for the rehabilitated process by the year 2010 and 2011 and thus Waseem (2013) used a series of the field observed rut depth data for each pavements from MTO's database by the end of year 2010 for the calibration. Because of the lack of structural layer information as well as insufficient number of rut depth observation after rehabilitated process, this research failed to use the most recent rut depth observation by the year 2012, 2013 and 2014. However, the calibration and validation process under this research used the field observed rut depth data for each pavements from MTO's database by the end of year 2010 as used by Waseem (2013) for the calibration. Keeping on the mind for the validation of the results, the author decided to split the rut depth observation of all 29 sections till the year 2009 for calibration and at year 2010 for validation purposes during this study. However, the sections 356, 1189 and 1200 having poor quality of rut observation in the year 2010 are carefully removed from the analysis through screening process. Similarly, sections 139, 811, 1053 and 1188 are removed from validation process because of lack of observed rut data in the database. Finally, the calibration results presented in Table 7.5 are used on all 22 sections to compare the predicted rut depth against its measured value. Meanwhile, a plot 94

between the observed total pavement rutting and the corresponding predicted values (refer to Figure 7.17) bare very good correlation (0.948) between them with a standard error of 0.879 mm. The resulting overall standard deviation is actually as good as to the result from the global calibration, as shown in Table 7.8.

7.6 Second-Stage Factor Analysis
Despite of difficulties for data management, analysis and result adaptation, the longitudinal calibration is performed to address the limitations of cross-sectional calibration. Due to a number of sets of calibration parameters, it is not possible to apply the results of longitudinal calibration directly for design and maintenance practices. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model that can best estimate the value of calibration parameters. Factor analysis is aimed to identify the causes behind the variation of calibration parameters for individual section so that a regression equation can be developed through multiple regression analysis 7.6.1 Superpave versus Marshall mix After obtaining a different sets of calibration coefficients, this study was concerned to find out whether a separate set of calibration parameters are required for Superpave and Marshall mix sections or not. A t-test was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no significant difference between mean value of calibration coefficients for Superpave and Marshall mix sections. The summary of the test is presented in Table 7.9 which rejects the null hypothesis for and and hence, it indicates a need of separate models for them. But on the other side, the and indicates that there is no need to separate the AC layer

null hypothesis is accepted for

rutting model for both mix type. The stiffness of Superpave mix is much greater than Marshall mix type and provide a strong protection to the underneath pavement layer. This difference in the mix properties cause a change in the calibration coefficients for base and sub-grade layer. Further, the better stiffness of Superpave mix enhance the load resistance and cause an increase in AC layer contribution to rutting in compare to Marshall mix type. The similar behavior on AC layer contribution is observed in the cross-sectional calibration. 96

However, there is large variation in the calibration coefficients. The use of average value of calibration coefficient increases the standard error and reduces the value as explained in

Section 7.2.2 and 7.4.1. Although it is better than the results from global calibration, this is not only the enough evident to generalize the calibration coefficients for the rutting models. A comparison of total rutting in Superpave and Marshall mix pavement also shows a great variation in the rutting behavior by project group but it is almost similar to a project (refer to section 1.1). The similar conclusion is drawn during the local calibration (refer to section 7.2.2). Hence, a comprehensive study of the rutting behavior for different mix type is required to explain the AC rutting model. Table 7.9: Summary of the t-test statistics for calibration parameters

7.6.2 Single factor analysis Further, the calibration coefficients obtained for each sections differ from another. This adds difficulties in the application of the model for design and maintenance practices. To overcome from such a situation, the effects of the local parameters such as environment, highway type, top AC layer thickness ( ( , total AC layer thickness ( , total granular base layer thickness

, sub-grade modulus (

, and AADTT on the obtained calibration coefficients were

observed. 7.6.2.1 Environment A t-test was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no environmental effect on calibration coefficients. The statistics also shows that there is no effect of environment on the sub-grade layer. This is because there is least effect of environment at low level. Similarly, the effect is insignificant for AC layer. From this observation, we can simply say that the model for dynamic 97

modulus included in AASHTOWare is sufficient to reflect the environmental effects. However, the test statistics for base layer rejects the null hypothesis. The possible reasons may be that the resilience modulus itself is either inadequate or does not reflect the environmental effect in the base layer.

7.6.2.2 Highway types A t-test was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no effect of highway type on calibration coefficients. The statistics accepts the null hypothesis and concludes no effect of highway type on calibration coefficients. This further concludes that the traffic load component is adequately considered in MEPDG rutting models and the estimation of its exponent is also reasonable. However, a effect is observed in the AC layer for Superpave sections which is not trustable because of very few number of Superpave sections from 400 series.

7.6.2.3 Top AC layer thickness A regression analysis, as shown in Table 7.14, was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no effect of top AC layer thickness on calibration coefficients. The relationship of top AC layer thickness with calibration coefficients are presented in Figures 7.18 and 7.19. A negative relationship is established by general observation but the effect is significant only for base layer. This is because the base layer is protected from thick top layer. The observation for Marshall mix are not trustable because of same thickness for almost all sections.

7.6.2.4 Total AC layer thickness A regression analysis (refer to Table 7.15) was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no effect of total AC layer thickness on calibration coefficients. The relationship of total AC layer thickness with calibration coefficients are presented in Figures 7.20 and 7.21. By general observation, a positive relationship is established for Superpave mix. But for Marshall type, a negative relationship is seen to AC and sub-grade layer where as a positive for base layer. On the 100

other side, the effect is significant only for base and sub-grade layer. The reason is not clear and hence this relationship is not trustable. However, an intensive investigation with precise material properties and layer specific coefficient is required to establish the relationship.

7.6.2.5 Total GB layer thickness A regression analysis, as shown in Table 7.16, was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no effect of total granular base (GB) layer thickness on calibration coefficients. The Figures 7.22 and 7.23 shows the relationship between total GB layer thickness and calibration coefficients. A negative relationship is established by general observation which is logical. The thick layer is more stiffer that protects itself from the rutting. From the test statistics, the effect is observed significant only for base layer.

7.6.2.6 Sub-grade modulus A regression analysis (refer to Table 7.17) was performed by setting a hypothesis that there is no effect of sub-grade modulus ( on calibration coefficients. The relationship of sub-grade

modulus with calibration coefficients are presented in Figures 7.24 and 7.25. A positive relationship is observed with AC and sub-grade layer coefficients where as negative with base layer. Further, there are only two Superpave section having sub-grade modulus 80MPa. for more realistic representation, the analysis was performed by removing these two sections which shows that the effect is significant in sub-grade layer. However, the effect of sub-grade modulus on AC layer coefficient of Marshall type is not clear. Table 7.17: Summary of the regression analysis for effect of sub-grade modulus

The Figures 7.26 and 7.27 shows the relationship between total AADTT and calibration coefficients. The trend of effect is similar to both mix type. However, the test statistics shows a significant effect on Superpave base which is contradictory and non trustable because of poor distribution of traffic. Hence, no significant evidence is available to establish the relationship between them. Table 7.18: Summary of the regression analysis for AADTT

7.6.2.8 Summary The summary of the effect of single factor on calibration coefficients are presented below. Based on the findings of the single factor analysis, it was aimed to develop a regression model through multiple regression analysis for the purpose of precise estimation of calibration coefficients which are required for design and maintenance practices within Ontario region. However, the results from this analysis are not sufficient to generalize the cause and effect relationship between them. Further, it is required to indentify others factors, if any, and develop a relationship through an intensive study. But at this point, comprehensive effect analysis is not possible because of lack of layer specific information such as layer contribution to rutting and layer specific rutting coefficient for AC layer.

7.7 Methodological Comparison
A full study of cross-sectional and longitudinal calibration was performed in this study. The results showed that the both type of model calibration are better than the global models comparing in terms of standard error (refer to Table 6.3 and 7.8).

105

A comparative plot of residual errors (Figure 7.28 and 7.29) for total predicted rut depth showed that the residuals errors for longitudinal calibration were closely and equally scattered on both sides of zero line, whereas for cross-sectional calibration, they were widely scattered. On the other side, the section-by-section calibration gave very efficient results of R2 value which shows great correlation between the predicted and observed values. But, in contrast, the crosssectional calibration shows extremely poor correlation with relatively high standard error. The similar result is observed from a comparative longitudinal plot of total rutting to some typical Superpave and Marshall type sections from Ontario's highways (refer to Figure 7.30). The model can be further improved by using layer by layer calibration strategy that requires the information of layer contribution to rutting which is still unknown to Ontario's roads. Thus, there is an urgent need of trench analysis for precise investigation.

CHAPTER 8

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This chapter summarizes the work of the local calibration study of the empirical rutting models of MEPDG method under Ontario's condition, draws conclusions from the analyses, and presents recommendations for future studies.

8.1 Summary
This thesis represents the third study at Ryerson University on the local calibration of the MEPDG distress models for Ontario's roadways. The study focuses on the rutting models and covers both the Superpave and Marshall mix sections. The study was partly funded by the MTO HIIFP (2013-2015). A comprehensive literature review was performed on previous efforts for local calibration. The study investigated the needs and challenges involved in the local calibration process. These issues were resolved based on a solid analyses of literature and statistical tests. Cross-sectional and longitudinal types of model calibration strategies were used for calibration of the rutting models. The results were compared, verified and proposed for the design and maintenance practices within Ontario. In addition to the first local calibration database developed by Jannat (2012), another local calibration database for Superpave sections under MTO's jurisdiction was developed and used them for calibration. The study of the behavior of rutting models raised a specific issues of indeterminacy and interdependency between the models during the full local calibration. To deal with this issue, the traffic and temperature exponents were prefixed to 0.30 and 1.5606, respectively, based on statistical analyses of the calibration results presented in NCHRP Report 719. Moreover, two different local calibration methods were developed: cross-sectional calibration to balance the section coverage issue and longitudinal calibration to satisfy the rutting trend tracking need. Both methods were used to calibrate the selected Superpave and Marshall mix pavement sections by considering equal weight for each observed rut depth. Further, a sensitivity study was performed with different value of traffic exponent during the longitudinal calibration to observe the prediction performance of the models based on standard error. The 108

results from both cross-sectional and longitudinal calibration methodology were compared with the results from global calibration and validated separately. Clustering analysis was performed based on Ontario zone, Highway functional class, Subgrade modulus, Top layer material and its performance grade to determine the possible cluster groups that improve the performance of the model. Further, factor analysis was also performed to see the possible causes of variation in calibration parameters during the longitudinal calibration.

8.2 Conclusions
Based on this study, the following conclusions are drawn: 1) The default, global rutting models consistently overestimate rutting in Ontario's existing flexible highways. This result echoes many previous calibration studies in U.S. and Canada. 2) The cross-sectional calibration reduces the residual standard deviation to a value of 1.20 mm and 2.21 mm for Superpave and Marshall mix sections, respectively, and 2.40 when calibrated jointly. The overall residual standard deviation is still less than the result from the global calibration. This implies that the cross-sectional calibration results can be used as level 3 input for Ontario's roads. 3) The large difference of the residual standard deviations in Superpave and Marshall mix sections suggests that the two types of materials should be separated and two rutting models be used. 4) The cross-sectional clustering analysis provides inconsistent and unconvincing results. While clustering based on environmental zone and sub-grade modulus seems to improve significantly the prediction performance of the rutting models for Marshall mix pavement sections, for Superpave pavement sections top layer material and top layer performance grade improve the model performance. 5) The sensitivity analyses suggested that the AC rutting model with the traffic exponent value of 0.30 obtains the lowest value of residual standard deviation. 6) The cross-sectional calibration fails to capture the longitudinal trend of evolution of rutting to Ontario's highway.

7)

The longitudinal calibration parameters of Superpave pavement sections spread over a wide range. In particular, AC scaling parameter ( granular base scaling parameters ( parameters ( ) varied from 1.801 to 4.300,

) varied from 0.185 to 2.137 and fine soil scaling

) varied from 0.013 to 0.137. Using an average value of calibration

parameters (2.717, 0.604 and 0.063) results in a standard error of 1.761 mm, comparable to the result from the global calibration. Hence, these average values will be appropriate as level 3 input for Ontario. 8) The longitudinal calibration parameters of Marshall mix pavement sections also spread over a wide range, where AC scaling parameter ( granular base scaling parameters ( parameters ( ) varied from 0.962 to 5.005,

) varied from 0.017 to 2.996 and fine soil scaling

) varied from 0.006 to 0.889. Using an average value of calibration

parameters (2.723, 1.036 and 0.246) results in a standard error of 2.254 which is as good as to the result from the global calibration. Hence, these average values will be appropriate as level 3 input for Ontario. 9) From the results of longitudinal calibration, it is concluded that the pavement sections should be treated separately by different mixes types including Superpave and Marshall mixes during the database management for pavement management system.

8.3 Recommendations
Based on the local calibration findings, the following important recommendations are made by the author for the further local calibration practices of the rutting models in Ontario.  For a more solid full local calibration study, it is recommended to take core and forensic investigation of the Ontario's pavements to determine the layer contribution to rutting. Solving linear regression equations sometimes complicates the optimization problem resulting negative values for the calibration coefficients which should never be the case. On the other side, the calculated layer contribution highly fluctuate. Thus, this confirms the value of layer contribution to rutting.  This research utilized only a limited number of new, reconstructed and rehabilitated pavement sections. Hence, the number of sections with long 110

historical data should be increased for local calibration practices ones retrieved from the MTO database.   It is recommended to collect the detailed material characterization data as level 1 input to robust the prediction performance of the models. The scope of this research was limited to King's highways and no pavement sections from secondary highways were selected in the calibration, although they are included in the database. Hence, further calibration for the secondary highways is needed.  It is important to understand that many other asphalt materials were excluded during this research (e.g., stone-matrix asphalt or SMA). Hence, the scope of the study could be expanded by incorporating such SMA pavement sections in future local calibration of the MEPDG models for Ontario.  It is better to understand that the results from section-by-section longitudinal calibration are more precise but less adaptable to design practices. Therefore to enhance the adaptability, it is recommended to develop a relationship between factors and the calibration coefficients by using highest accuracy level for material characterization and layer specific rutting coefficients before recalibration of the MEPDG rutting models for Ontario.
