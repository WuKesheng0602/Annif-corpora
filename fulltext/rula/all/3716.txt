ABSTRACT   
  Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) bars are rapidly becoming an alternative to conventional steel reinforcing  bars  in  bridge  construction.  This  research  investigated  the  bond  behaviour  of  glass  fiber  reinforced  polymer  (GFRP)  bars  embedded  in  highperformance  concrete  (HPC).  Sandcoated  and  ribbedsurface  GFRP  bars  of  16  and  20  mm  diameters  were  considered  in  this  study.  Concrete  blocks  were  cast  with  embedded GFPR bars to conducted pullout tests to examine the effect of varying parameters on their  pullout and bond strengths, namely: embedment length, bar diameter, surface treatment, and concrete  cover.  In  addition,  bond  characteristic  were  analyzed  between  straight  and  headended  sandcoated  GFRP bars. The experimental results were used to evaluate the development lengths specified in design  codes. It was determined that the development lengths for straight GFRP bars provided by the codes are  conservative.  Also,  the  development  length  for  headend  bar  is  shorter  than  that  for  similar  bar  with  straight end.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction 
1.1. Introduction  
In  Canada,  the  majority  of  bridges  were  built  throughout  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  many  of  these bridges are located in Ontario (Ametrano, 2011). Bridges built within this period of time did not  use  proper  airentrained  concrete  and  are  deteriorating  due  to  repetitive  freezethaw  cycles.  The   reinforcing steel is also corroding due to repetitive penetration of winter deicing salts over the years.  According  to  Weber  et  al.  (1998)  over  40%  of  all  bridges  in  Canada  require  significant  maintenance,  rehabilitation, and replacement, which amounts to an estimated value of $10 billion.  However, current  bridge  rehabilitation  procedures  are  costly  and  timeconsuming,  and  Canada  is  in  desperate  needs  to  develop an alternative solution to provide durable, sustainable bridges to avoid the high rehabilitation  costs.   Currently, two design codes in Canada permit the use of FRP bars as internal reinforcement in  concrete structures and are used to completely replace the role of conventional reinforcing steel.  There  are several types of existing FRP technology being used today, such as carbon fibre reinforced polymer  (CFRP),  aramid  fibre  reinforced  polymer  (AFRP),  and  glass  fibre  reinforced  polymer  (GFRP).  However,  GFRP bars are more frequently used due to its inexpensive cost relative to the other products. FRPs have  many advantages that can be considered as an excellent alternative to reinforcing steel in bridge decks,  including its noncorrodible composition, electromagnetic neutrality, high durability and high strength toweight ratio. This advanced reinforcing technology has high potential of improving the durability of  bridges;  however,  FRP  bars  are  fairly  new  products  in  North  America,  and  there  is  still  a  lot  of  development  and  understanding  of  how  it  will  endure  and  perform  as  it  replaces  conventional  reinforcing steel.  One critical aspect that still needs more development is the bond performance of FRP  in concrete. It is vital to study the bond behaviour of FRP bars embedded in concrete to develop a design  standards that can be utilized by engineers. 

1.2 Objective of the Project 
  Â· The main objectives of this research project are to:  Evaluate the controlling variables that affect the bond stress and bond mechanism between HPC  and GFRP bars which included:  o o surface treatment  embedment length  1 

 

o o o Â·

bar diameter  concrete cover  bar's end condition (straight or headed)  

Conduct comparative analysis of the bond stress vs. slip relationship between the different  types of GFRP bars preinstalled in HPC 

Â·

Determine the development length and verify if the calculated values based on prescribed  design codes can potentially be used in prefabricated deck panels 

1.3 Layout of the Project 
  The  layout  of  the  project  includes  a  literature  review  and  experimental  investigation  on  the  bond performance and mechanisms that exist for different GFRP bars embedded in HPC. The focus of  the  study  was  to  investigate  the  potential  usage  of  different  type  of  GFRP  bars,  namely  sandcoated  surface bars (VRod) and ribbedsurface bars (SchÃ¶ck ComBAR), in the joints of precast bridge decks. The  study  also  focused  on  how  the  controlling  factors,  such  as  bar  diameter,  surface  treatment,  concrete  cover and embedment length, influenced the variability of the results.   Chapter 2 provides background, literature review and introduces the design equations that are used in  the  research.  The  background  and  literature  review  covers  previous  research  studies  relevant  to  the  bond  behaviour  and  mechanism  relevant  to  GFRP  and  FRP  in  varies  concrete  mix.  This  chapter  also  includes  information  on  the  different  controlling  variables  that  plays  a  role  in  the  variability  of  the  results.  Chapter 3 presents the experimental program. All materials, software and methodologies used for the  experimental procedures are also covered in this chapter.  Chapter  4  presents  the  experimental  results  and  a  full  parametric  study  of  the  effects  of  embedment  length,  bar  diameter,  concrete  cover,  surface  treatments,  and  bar's  end  conditions  on  the  bond  characteristics  of  GFRP  bars  embedded  in  high  performance  concrete.  Comparative  analysis  and  discussions of different GFRP products are conducted in terms of performance and bond failure mode.  Also,  the  design  equations  are  used  in  this  chapter  to  determine  the  basic  experimental  development  length.

Chapter  5  presents  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  results  that  are  used  to  provide  a  comparative  analysis  regarding  the  bond  performance  of  the  two  different  GFRP  bar.  Recommendations  are  also  included  to  better  enhance  this  research  and  future  studies  that  can  potentially  branch  off  from  this  research.

Chapter 2: Background, Literature Review and Design Equations  
2.1  Introduction 
  It is a fact that the majority of bridges across Canada are deteriorating due to the nonuse of air entrained concrete and repetitive cycles of freezethaw, and corroding steel due to the penetration of  winter  deicing  salts,  and  it  is  costing  our  country  billions  of  dollars  to  rehabilitate  and  replace  these  bridges. However, with current technology and research, new productions such as FRP reinforcing bars  are receiving more acknowledgements in the industry and they are being accepted as an alternative to  reinforcing steel in bridge decks.   There  have  been  growing  numbers  of  researchers  eager  to  learn  more  about  the  new  technology and study the bond behaviour of FRP bars embedded in concrete, which has allowed us to  develop  a  design  standard  that  can  be  utilized  by  engineers  in  the  near  future.  Thus,  this  chapter  presents  a  few  broad  overview  studies  conducted  that  relate  to  GFRP  and  other  FRP  reinforcing  bars  used with several types of concrete mixes.  

2.2 General Features of FRPs 
Fibre  reinforced  polymers  (FRPs)  are  composite  materials  that  consist  of  fibres  in  a  polymer  matrix  (Bisby,  2006).  The  matrix  consists  of  a  binding  material  that  is  used  to  bind  the  fibres  together  and protect the fibres from any abrasion and environmental degradations. This bond is essential and is  the main component that provides FRPs' advantageous mechanical properties when used as reinforcing  material. Figure 2.1 demonstrates an elementary composition of FRPs.

2.2.1 Fibres  
  There  is  a  wide  selection  of  fibres  used  in  FRPs;  however,  when  used  in  current  structural  engineering  practices,  the  most  commonly  used  fibres  are  glass  (GFRP),  carbon  (CFRP),  and  aramid  (AFRP). By standard procedures, fibres must be treated with coupling agents to effectively bond with the  resin matrix.     Glass  fibres  are  processed  from  glass  composed  of  silica  oxide  from  silica  sand  and  some  may 

consist  of  raw  materials,  such  as  limestone,  fluorspar,  boric  acid  and  clay.  The  glass  fibres  are  manufactured  by  melting  the  oxides  into  fine  particles,  with  particle  sizes  ranging  from 3 to 24  .  In  the current civil engineering applications, GFRP bars are most commonly used due to their high strength  with their relatively lower cost. The most common use of glass fibre in the industry is Eglass.     Carbon  fibre  is  manufactured  from  a  pyrolysis  process,  which  is  a  procedure  that  requires 

processing  temperatures  above  1500Â°C.  Carbon  fibres  are  known  for  their  high  elastic  modulus  and  fatigue strength relative to glass fibres, thus they are widely used in prestressing tendons and structural  FRP wraps for restoration projects.     Aramid  is  the  third  type  of  fibre.  It  is  manufactured  from  a  solution  of  aromatic  polyamide 

through an extrusion procedure at temperature ranges between 50Â°C to 80Â°C, then placed in a cylinder  of temperature 200Â°C. From the manufacturing process, the aramid fibres exhibit anisotropic properties,  and results in a relatively lower compressive and shear strengths.  

2.2.2 Resins  
  The  selection  of  the  matrix  that  bonds  the  fibres  is  crucial,  as  the  physical  properties  of  the  matrix significantly affect the final mechanical properties of the FRPs. The main role of the matrix is to  help  transfer  stresses  between  the  fibres.  In  order  to  obtain  the  optimal  strength  of  the  fibres,  the  matrix  must  have  the  ability  to  produce  higher  ultimate  strain  than  the  fibres  (Philips,  1989).  Additionally,  coating  of  the  fibres  is  highly  recommended  to  protect  the  fibres  from  abrasion  and  friction. The matrix materials are categorized into two groups depending on the manufacturing process,  and  they  are  thermoplastic  and  thermosetting  polymer.  Thermoplastic  polymers  are  commonly  nylon,  polyetheretheketine (PEEK), polyesters and epoxies. The thermoplastics matrix polymers are produced  by  aligning  molecules  in  a  linear  formation  (Ametrano,  2011).  As  for  thermosetting  matrix  polymers,  they  are  produced  from  semisolid  precursors  (Tuakta,  2004).  At  the  final  manufacturing  process,  the  resin hardens and cannot be reformed or reshaped by applying heat or pressure. Thermosetting resins  offer  high  rigidity,  and  thermal  and  dimensional  stability  at  service  temperature  relative  to  thermoplastic matrix polymer (Ametrano, 2011), which can be advantageous.   5 

 

2.2.3 Properties of FRPs 
FRP  materials  are  isotropic;  therefore,  the  mechanical  and  physical  properties  of  FRP  vary  differently  in  the  longitudinal  and  transverse  direction.  Based  on  Bisby's  paper  (2006),  the  transverse  properties depend on the resin of the FRP bar, whereas the fibres dominate the longitudinal properties.  All  FRPs  produce  a  similar  linear  elastic  tensile  stressstrain  relationship  and  when  used  in  concrete  reinforcing  applications,  they  exhibit  this  trend  up  to  failure,  whereas  the  conventional  steel  reinforcement  exhibits  a  plateau  relationship.  FRP  reinforcements  have  high  strengthtoweight  ratios  and have an elastic linear behaviour in tensile strength that can be achieved with one fifth of the weight  of steel (Tuakta, 2005). The stressstrain relationship between different FRP bars and conventional steel  bars is shown in Figure 2.2. Yielding in the FRP does not exist, indicating that failure is brittle, when the  tensile strength of the material is exceeded. The properties of each FRP vary depending on the type and  proportions of fibre, the matrix used, and the manufacturing process. The different branches of stress strain curves in the graph for each different FRP bars demonstrate this.

2.3 Applications of FRPs in Structural Engineering  
  FRPs are used in current civil engineering practices in different forms. FRP reinforcing bars  entered into the North American construction industry in the late 1970's and, since then, have been  used in many rehabilitation projects, such as restoring pedestrian and highway bridges, deck panels, and  even concrete highway barriers. FRPs can also be used as internal reinforcing bars and prestressing  tendons. In Canada, one of the first concrete bridge deck slabs that solely used FRP reinforcing bars was  constructed in 1995 over the Salmon River in Nova Scotia. Since then, there have been numerous  amounts of bridges that have incorporated the use of FRP bars. In addition, FRP reinforcing bars have  various surface treatments, which aid the bond between the bars and the surrounding concrete. Such  surface treatments include sandcoating, wound surface and ribbedsurface. Another application of FRPs  is FRP shear strengthening strips. FRPs have prominent shear and flexural strengthening abilities and are  mainly used in rehabilitation projects. Materials used for these projects are premanufactured rigid FRP  strips, which bond to the surface of elements that exhibit inadequate shear strength (Bisby, 2006). An  example of such application is shown in Figure 2.3. This photograph illustrates a bridge in Maryland in  Winnipeg, which was constructed in 1969. This bridge was investigated in accordance with current  codes and it was discovered that the Lshaped concrete girder lacked the shear strength to withstand  the current truckloads. As a solution, four girders were strengthened using FRP sheets and to this day,  strain gauges are attached to the girders for ongoing basis monitoring.

Over the past few years, FRP applications have gradually been implemented in many structural  engineering projects and are now fully recognized by design codes and provisions, such as CHBDC 2006,  and CSA S80612. Full chapter of standards, minimum requirements, and guides on the use of FRPs  materials have fully been developed in the standards. 

2.4 HighPerformance Concrete (HPC) 
  Highperformance concrete (HPC) exceeds the properties of normal concrete. In current  construction practices, HPC is used in tunnels, bridges, and tall buildings due to its strength, durability,  and high modulus of elasticity.  HPC has an average compressive strength between 70 MPa and 140  MPa, and is made with selected high quality ingredients. HPC provides many advantageous  characteristics relative to normal concrete including:  Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· High early strength  High modulus of elasticity  High durability  Resistance to chemical attack  Volume stability   High resistance to frost and deicer scaling damage 

Tables 2.1 highlight the general properties of HPC, respectively.

2.5 Bond Mechanism 
2.5.1 StraightEnded Bars    The  bond  mechanism  of  FRP  bars  performs  differently  than  conventional  steel  reinforcement  due to the different manufacturing procedures and difference in material properties in both longitudinal  and transverse directions (Cosenza et al., 1997). In Cosenza et al.'s research (1997), experimental results  suggested  that  the  bond  between  FRP  reinforcement  and  concrete  is  controlled  by  several  factors  including  chemical  bond,  friction  due  to  surface  roughness  of  FRP  bars,  mechanical  interlock,  and  expansion  of  the  FRP  bar  due  to  temperature  change  and  moisture  absorption.  The  bond  action  between FRP and surrounding concrete reaches maximum tensile strength, adequate flexural capacity,  and shear resistance only when there is tight bond between the concrete and the FRP bar. In Figure 2.4,  the three bond mechanisms are shown on a typical bar. The forces applied to the bar are counteracted  by  the  compressive  and  shear  stresses  in  the  surrounding  concrete,  and  these  forces  result  in  tensile  stresses  which  are  released  in  the  form  of  cracks  in  the  concrete.  Thus,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  bond  mechanism  of  FRP  bars  differ  from  the  conventional  steel  reinforcing  bars.  To  fully  characterize  the  mechanism of load and stress transfer along the surface of the FRP bar and the surrounding concrete,  the anisotropic nature of FRP needs to be understood. FRP's mechanical and physical properties differ in  the  longitudinal  and  transverse  direction.  Based  on  Bisby's  paper  (2006),  the  transverse  properties  depend on the resin of the FRP bar, whereas the fibres dominate the longitudinal properties. It is also  found that the strength of the resin is lower than the compressive strength of the concrete. Thus, this  results  in  a  different  bond  interaction  from  that  of  conventional  steel  reinforcements  and,  also,  demonstrates  that  the  bond  strength  greatly  depends  on  the  failure  stresses  and  strains  in  FRP's  longitudinal  and  transverse  directions  (Cosenza  et  al.  1997).  Although  the  bond  behaviour  and  mechanism  of  FRP  bars  depend  on  various  factors,  the  factors  discussed  above  demonstrate  that  by  understanding  FRP's  properties,  it  will  aid  researchers  to  understand  more  on  its  effect  on  bond  behaviour and strength.

2.5.2 Bond Failure Modes   Typically, there are three types of failures that occur when pullout tests are conducted. These  failure types are dependent on bond properties between the concrete and the FRP bars. The failure  types are as follows:  Â· Â· Â· Bar rupture  Bar pullout   Concrete splitting  

Bar rupture occurs when the full tensile strength of the bar is reached or exceeded during the  bond test. This type of failure is classified as a premature failure of the bar and is not recommended as  it provides limited information on the required bar development length and insignificant input in the  analysis of the bond behavior of the system.    A  bar  pullout  failure  occurs  when  the  bond  between  the  FRP  bar  and  the  concrete  cannot  resist the load applied on the test bar with adequate confinement and the concrete cover is sufficient  to prevent a splitting failure. This failure is usually associated with shearing of the surrounding concrete  around the bar when the bar slips out (Ametrano, 2011), which is schematically shown in Figure 2.5. 

  Figure 2.5: Side View of Shear Cracking due to Bar Pullout Failure (Ametrano, 2011)  Concrete splitting is the type of failure that represents a wellconfined bond between the FRP  bar and the concrete and is able to withstand the splitting stresses. As the bar is under tension, cracks  are  typically  formed  around  the  bar,  which  propagate  to  the  surface  and,  when  there  is  sufficient  cracking, the embedded bar will be exposed. Splitting failure is characterized by the concrete splitting  along the bar length.

2.6 Bond Stress versus Slip  
The bond characteristics between reinforcement and concrete can be graphically described by  means of a bond stressslip relationship and can also be used to calculate the development and splice  lengths (Cosenza et al. 1996). An example of a bondslip graph is illustrated in Figure 2.6 for sandcoated  CFRP specimens. The two graphs demonstrate the bond stress plotted against the loadedend slip and  the unloadedend slip. Typically, the bond stressslip graphs compose of an initial steep curve, indicating  the increasing of bond strength with a small slip up to the ultimate bond stress. This point on the graph  demonstrates that the frictional force and chemical adhesion between the concrete and reinforcing bar  are fully contributing in attaining this bond of the entire system (Baena et al. 2009).  

  Figure 2.6: BondSlip Relationship (M. Baena et al., 2009) Despite the numerous existing formulations for steel reinforcing bars, extensive research efforts are still  required to establish a consistent analytical model of the bond stressslip behaviour for FRP bars. In the  following subsections, an overview of a number of available models for FRP bars is presented.   2.6.1 Malvar Model    The Malvar Model, developed by Malvar (1994), was one of the first models created to explain 

the  bond  characteristics  of  FRP  bars  with  concrete.  The  experimental  research  was  carried  out  with  GFRP  bars  composed  of  different  outer  surface  shapes  and  a  fixed  tensile  strength  of  the  concrete.  Based  on  the  experimental  results,  Malvar  (1994)  proposed  a  refined  model  for  the  overall  bond  behaviour and it is represented by the following relationship:

( 2 .1 )     ! 1+ -2 + ! !  where:   !  is the peak bond stress    is the confining axisymmetric radial pressure  ! is the slip at peak bond stress   F,G is empirical constants for each bar type  2.6.2 Eligehausen, Popov, and Bertero Model (BPE Model)    The BPE model is a wellknown bond stressslip law developed in 1983 by Eligehausen et al. by 

failing deformed steel bars through pullout experimentation. The BPE model, shown in Figure 2.7, shows  4  different  curves.  The  initial  curve  on  the  bond  stressslip  relationship  ascends  to  the  point (! , ! ),  indicating  the  maximum  bond  stress,  ,  is  achieved  at  a  slip  of ! ,  for  < ! .  The  second  curve  is  a  plateau,  demonstrating  that  the  maximum  bond  stress  is  attained  while  the  slip  is  increasing  up  to !   until failure. A gradual descending line follows this from points (! , ! ) to (! , ! ) and a horizontal trend  line is developed with a value of  = !  and with the slip  > ! .  

  Figure 2.7: BPE Model (Eligehausen et al., 1983)             12 

The initial ascending curve was then modeled in the following expression:    = ! ! where:  !  is the maximum bond stress   ! is the slip corresponding to the maximum bond stress   , is a curvefitting parameter and must not be greater than 1  (Ametrano, 2011)  Researchers, including Cosenza et al. (1996), have successfully applied this model to FRP bars  with minor modifications to the BPE model to represent the FRP bond stressslip relationship. From the  experimental results by Cosenza et al. (1996), the second trend line, as illustrated in Figure 2.7, was non existent for FRP bars, thus the team proposed the modified BPE model with a different expression for  the same initial ascending trend line, which is given by:    =1- - 1                                                                                                                                                  ( 2 .3 )   ! ! where:    ! , is the slope from points  ! , ! to (! , ! ).

Which resulted in the following model shown in Figure 2.8.

2.6.3 CMR Model     A refined model of the bond stressslip model was developed by Cosenza et al (1997) to remodel 

the  ascending  branch  of  the  BPE  model  to  captivate  the  bond  stressslip  behaviour  for  FRP  bars.  This  model represents an alternative to the BPE model and the modified expression is given as:

where:  !  is the peak bond stress  !  and   are parameters used for curvefitting purposes for the actual data 

2.7 Controlling Variables Affecting Bond Behaviour of FRP bar Embedded in Concrete 
  There  are  several  factors  that  affect  the  bond  between  FRP  bars  and  concrete.  The  factors  include  fibre  type,  surface  treatment,  bar  diameter,  embedment  length,  concrete  cover  and  the  concrete properties. These factors each play a significant role in the bond behaviour and it is essential to  understand how each parameter affect the bond mechanism and bond strength.  2.7.1 Effect of Fibre Type on Bond Action     Two design codes that are used in this research project are the CHBDC 2006 and CSA S80612  and they are used to determine the minimum required development length for the FRP bars. Only the  CSA S80612 design code takes into account the bar fibre, which influences the development length and  the bond strength. The bar fibre factor of 1.0 corresponds to CFRP and GFRP bars and a factor of 1.25 is  assigned  to  AFRP  bars.  Thus,  CSA  S80612  recognizes  that  AFRP  bars  produce  lower  bond  strength  relative to CFRP and GFRP bars. The research conducted by Achillides et al. (2004) validates CSA S806 12's notion. The research consisted of beam tests to evaluate the bond strength between GFRP, CFRP,  and  traditional  steel  reinforcing  bars.  It  was  concluded  that  specimens  with  GFRP  and  CFRP  bars  produced  a  bond  strength  of  72%  of  the  bond  strength  of  the  traditional  steel  reinforcing  bars,  which  validated that glass and carbon fibres have a similar effect on the bond strength.   2.7.2 Effect of Surface Treatment and Configuration on Bond Action   

 

GFRP bars can be manufactured with various surface configurations and surface treatments to  improve the bond action with the surrounding concrete to optimize load transfer.  The different surface  configurations  and  treatments  include  ribbed,  spiraled  wrapped,  helical,  and  sandcoated  surfaces.  These  are  used  to  improve  the  bond  between  the  reinforcing  bar  and  the  surrounding  concrete.  14 

 

Similarly, in conventional steel reinforcing bar practices, the deformation on the bar results in a higher  bond relative to a plain, smooth bar, as it provides mechanical interlocking between the surface of the  rebar and concrete (Alunno Rossetti  et al., 1995).    In the research conducted by Al Â­Zahrani (1995), the  experimental program was set up to investigate the behaviour of smooth glassvinyl ester bars with the  removal of the resinrich layer. The experimental results demonstrated an increase of bond strength due  to the bar's surface condition. It shows that the surface condition affects the adhesion and friction bond  mechanisms.  In  CSA  S80612,  Clause  9.9.3  (e),  the  bar  surface  profile  factor  is  provided  for  different  types of surface treatments, such as 1.0 for sandcoated surfaces, 1.05 for spiral pattern, 1.0 for braided  pattern, 1.05 for ribbed surfaces and 1.80 for indented surfaces. Thus, it can be seen that CSA S80612,  listed  both  sandcoated  surface  and  braided  pattern  FRP  bars  to  produce  relatively  higher  bond  strength.  The  study  conducted  by  Morales  Arias  et  al.  (2012)  supports  this  statement.  Morales  et  al.  (2012)  studied  the  influence  of  sand  granulometry  on  the  bond  strength  between  sandcoated  GFRP  bars and concrete. Two different bar sizes of 9 mm and 16 mm were used, and for each size, the bar was  coated  with  fine  and  coarse  sand  with  the  mean  grain  size  of  1.2  mm  and  300  respectively.  In  addition, two different types of concrete were used, including conventional concrete and high resistance  concrete  (HRC)  with  a  mean  7  day  strength  of  23.5  MPa  and  56  MPa,  respectively.  The  pullout  specimens  were  prepared  in  cylinder  molds  with  a  diameter  of  100  mm  and  a  height  of  200  mm.  Embedment  lengths  of  5 !  and  10!  were  also  used  for  investigation.  The  experimental  results  concluded  that  GFRP  bars  coated  with  the  coarser  sand  resulted  in  higher  bond  strength  due  to  increased friction and interlocking forces.   As for the GFRP bars with a finer sand coat, this group of specimens resulted in a lower bond  strength due to the stripping of the sand particles, although the research conducted by Morales et al.  (2012) suggests that sandcoated surface profile provides higher bond strength. Makitanit et al. (1993)  also noted that the sandcovered FRP bars demonstrate good bond performance due to the increased  chemical bond provided by the sand particles initially, but abrupt detachment of the sand particles led  to a brittle bond failure. However, Hao et al. (2009) suggests differently. This research group studied the  effect  of  bond  action  between  GFRP  bars  and  concrete  with  various  ribbed  patterned  GFRP  bars.  The  test included 24 different rib geometries of GFRP bars. The rib configurations included rib spacing, which  is  measured  from  centertocenter  of  the  bar's  ribs,  rib  angle,  which  is  angle  measured  between  the  longitudinal axis to the inclined rib, and the rib height, which is the difference between the bar radius at  the rib and radius at midpoint between the rib to the next one. The research showed that ribbed GFRP  bars with rib spacing equal to the bar diameter exceeds the bond strength of the sandcoated bar and 

 

15 

exhibits  a  better  bondslip  relationship  with  the  least  end  slip  at  failure.  It  can  be  seen  that  research  conducted  by  both  Morales  et  al.  (2012)  and  Hao  et  al.  (2009)  led  to  different  conclusions  and  essentially  opposes  each  other.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  FRP  surface  treatment  still  requires  more  investigation and is open to debate.   2.7.3 Effects of GFRP bar diameter on Bond Action   The  relationship  between  bar  diameter  and  bond  strength  of  FRP  bars  embedded  in  concrete  has been widely investigated by Larradle and Silva Rodriguez (1993), Benmokrane et al. (1996), Baena et  al. (2008), Tighiouart et al. (1998 and 1999), Hao et al. (2009) and Morales et al. (2012). All researchers  attained  similar  results  and  concluded  that  the  bond  strength  increases  as  the  diameter  of  the  bar  decreases.  Benmokrane et al. (1996) conducted the experiment with GFRP bars with bar diameters of  12.7,  15.9,  19.1  and  25.4  mm  and  the  resulting  bond  strengths  were  10.6,  7.3,  6.6  and  6.4  MPa,  respectively.  Baena  et  al.  (2008)  studied  both  CFRP  and  GFRP  with  various  diameter  sizes  with  the  largest  being  19.55  mm  for  GFRP  and  13.43  mm  for  CFRP.  As  a  result,  the  larger  diameter  FRP  bars  resulted  in  lower  bond  strengths,  which  validates  the  preceding  findings.  This  phenomenon  can  be  explained by the peak bond stress gradually migrating from the loaded end towards the unloaded end,  which  results  in  the  lower  than  average  bond  strength.  Baena  et  al.  (2008)  also  suggested  that  the  Poisson effect may also be another reason that the pullout forces increase as the bar diameter gradually  decreases. This demonstrates that the Poisson effect can potentially have greater influence on the bond  properties for specimens with bars of larger diameter. Ultimately, this reduces the frictional forces and  mechanical locking stresses. Additionally, Tigouart et al. (1998) concluded that this phenomenon is due  to the bleed water trapped around the bar creating an interfacial transition zone that limits the contact  surface  between  the  bar  and  the  surrounding  concrete,  and  also  reduces  the  frictional  forces  and  mechanical  interlocking.  This  was  also  the  conclusion  drawn  from  the  research  conducted  by  Sayed  Ahmed et al. (2009).  2.7.4 Effects of Embedment Length on Bond Action   Embedment  length  is  defined  as  the  length  that  will  bond  with  the  surrounding  concrete  to  transfer the loads and stresses. According to research conducted by, Benmokrane et al. (1996), Tigiouart  et al. (1998 & 1999) and Firas et al. (2009), the increase of embedment length results in a decrease in  bond strength. This relationship can be explained by the nonlinear distribution of bond stress along the  FRP bar embedded in the concrete. In recent studies conducted by Firas et al. (2009), the experimental  results  demonstrated  that  the  embedment  length  is  a  function  of  bar  diameter  and  is  directly 

 

16 

proportional  to  it.  Thus,  with  an  increase  of  the  GFRP  bar  diameter,  a  larger  embedment  length  is  needed to reach the same normal bond stress in order to avoid nonlinear distribution of bond stresses  along the FRP bar from bei ng so pronounced (Firas et al., 2009). Morales et al. (2012) presented similar  results  with  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  where  the  bond  strength  for  shorter  length  is  double  that  of  the  longer length. Sayed Ahmad et al. (2009) explained that friction reduction occurs from the elongation of  the bar from the pullout force and concluded that shorter embedment lengths developed higher bond  strength,  which  provides  more  frictional  forces.  Results  obtained  by  Ametrano  (2011)  confirm  the  preceding  findings.  Ametrano  (2011)  conducted  both  beam  and  pullout  tests  with  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  embedded  in  high  strength  and  ultrahigh  performance  concrete,  which  both  demonstrated  a  decrease in bond strength as the embedment length increased.   2.7.5 Effect of Concrete Cover on Bond Action   Research  conducted  by  Ehsani  et  al.  (1997)  included  a  total  of  102  specimens  with  three  different diameter GFRP bars. It was observed that the mode of failure was greatly dependent on the  concrete cover. Specimens with a concrete cover of one bar diameter, 1! , resulted in splitting failure,  whereas specimens with a concrete cover of two bar diameter, 2! , resulted in either a pullout failure  or bar rupture.  Wambeke and Shield (2006) also presented similar results where splitting failures were  accompanied by a clear cover between one and three bar diameter and half of the group of specimens  resulted in pullout failures with a concrete cover of more than three bar diameter, 3! . From Ryerson  University,  Ametrano  (2011)  discovered  that  the  effect  of  the  concrete  cover  on  bond  behaviour  was  more pronounced with specimens casted with high strength concrete. From these specimens, Ametrano  (2011)  discovered  that  with  a  19.1  mm  bar  diameter  and  a  concrete  cover  of  60  mm,  stronger  bond  strength  was  achieved,  relative  to  the  group  of  specimens  with  a  concrete  cover  of  40  mm.  As  for  specimens casted with a 15.9 mm bar diameter, an average increase of 9% in bond strength from 40 mm  to  60  mm  concrete  cover  was  found.  Therefore,  the  preceding  findings  suggest  that  the  effect  of  concrete  cover  significantly  affects  the  mode  of  bond  failure  and  bond  strength.  Additionally,  in  CSA  S80612, a factor is incorporated to account for the effect of concrete cover in the development length  and bond strength design equations.  2.7.6 Effect of Concrete Properties on Bond Action      Concrete compressive strength is another parameter that affects the bond action between FRP 

bar and the concrete.  In design codes, such as CSA S80612 and ACI, the effect of concrete strength is  taken into consideration using the square root of the compressive strength (  ).  Stated earlier, the 

 

17 

bond mechanism consists of adhesion, bearing, and friction when there is applied load on the bar. The  forces  subjected  to  the  bar  are  counteracted  by  both  compressive  and  shear  stresses  around  the  concrete, which can prompt bond failure due to either tensile splitting or shearing off concrete (ACI). To  resist tensile splitting failure, the compressive strength of the concrete needs to be increased because of  the proportional relationship between concrete's compressive strength and its tensile strength (ACI). In  Ehasani  et  al.'s  research  (1997),  the  team  casted  specimens  with  concrete  compressive  strengths  ranging from 28 MPa and 56 MPa, the specimens were tested in pairs with all other factors remaining  constant except for the concrete strengths. The ultimate bond stress for the specimens were 4.83 MPa  (700  psi)  versus  5.46  MPa  (792  psi);  and  3.91  MPa  (567  psi)  and  4.08  MPa  (592  psi).  The  two  pairs  demonstrated a slight increase of bond stress with increasing concrete compressive strength. However,  the increase was not proportional to the expected square root of concrete compressive strength, which  is still implied in North American design codes. Ehasnai et al. (1997) also discovered that both splitting  failure and pullout failure were dependent on the concrete strength, whereas bar fracture is controlled  by tensile capacity of the GFRP bar only. In Ametrano's study (2011) specimens with sandcoated GFRP  bars were casted with 4 different concrete strengths, ranging from 70 MPa to 175 Mpa. The results also  demonstrated  a  slight  increase  in  bond  strength  with  increasing  concrete  strength.  The  research  conducted by Achillides et al. (2004) included concrete compressive strength of 15Mpa and 30 MPa. The  findings  demonstrated  for  the  case  of  concrete  strength  greater  than  30  MPa,  bond  failure  occurred  partly on the surface of the GFRP bar and in the concrete. Baena et al. (2009) explained that when this  happens, it indicates that the bond strength of the FRP bar does not depend on the concrete strength,  but  rather  on  the  GFRP  bar's  properties.  As  for  specimens  with  a  compressive  strength  of  15  MPa,  crushing  of  the  concrete  away  from  the  surface  of  the  bar  was  noted,  indicating  the  bond  strength  is  dependent  on  the  concrete  strength  (Achillides  et  al.  2004).  The  preceding  finding  was  validated  by  Baena et al. (2009) with two different concrete strengths, 28.63 MPa and 52.19 MPa, labelled as ! and  ! ,  respectively.  The  experimental  results  demonstrated  that  concrete  with  compressive  strength  greater than 30 MPa caused bond failure to occur at the vicinity of the FRP bar, indicating that the bond  strength  depends  on  the  bar's  properties,  rather  than  the  concrete  strength.  However,  for  lower  compressive strength concrete, around 15 MPa, the bond failure mode changes and failure was seen to  take place at the concrete matrix interface. When !  concrete specimens were tested, all the specimens  failed  in  a  pullout  mode  with  failure  taking  place  in  the  concrete  surface.  Increasing  the  concrete  strength above !  did not change the mode of failure; nevertheless, there was more damage on the   GFRP bar surface (Baena et al. 2009).

2.8 Determination of Bond Strength 
  ACI  defines  bond  stress  as  the  resultant  stress  at  the  surface  of  the  FRP  bar  from  the  force  component  in  the  direction  of  the  bar.  Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  bond  strength  of  FRP  bar  embedded  in  concrete  has  been  extensively  investigated  by  researchers,  as  mentioned  in  previous  sections, through different types of tests, such as pullout tests, beam tests, splice tests, and cantilever  beam tests to determine a conventional empirical formula that allow designers and other professionals  to define bond strength. In earlier studies, bond strength was simply evaluated with the ultimate tensile  load until failure from these tests. Ehasnai et al. (1997) defined bond stress as the shear force per unit  surface area of the rebar, and has the following form:                                                                                                                                                                    ( 2 .5 )    ! !"

where    is  the  bond  stress,    is  the  applied  tension  force,  !  is  the  bar  diameter  and  !"  is  the  embedment length. Equation 2.5 was developed with an assumption of a uniform distribution of stress  and that the force on the bar is resisted by an average bond stress,  , which is acting along the surface  of  the  bar  (Ametrano,  2011).  Although  this  equation  is  used  to  determine  the  bond  stress,  it  is  not  enough to define the strength of FRP bars embedded in concrete. By solely measuring the ultimate bond  strength, it only gives an average sense, and does not provide a good representation of, the actual bond  properties. Slipstrain and bond stressslip relationships also need to be established to fully understand  the FRP bond strength along with the parameters Tighiouart et al. (2008) specifically discussed, such as  embedment length, bar diameter, concrete cover and surface treatment.

2.9 Development Length Equations in Design Codes 
  In  current  design  codes,  development  and  splice  lengths  are  already  implemented  and  they  represent  the  length  of  embedded  reinforcement  requires  to  develop  adequate  strength  of  the  reinforcement at any critical location (CSA S80612). The development lengths provided by CSA S80612  and CHBDC 2006 are presented in the following sections.   2.9.1 CHBDC 2006 Development Length Equation     In CHBDC 2006, the development length equation shown in Equation 2.6 is provided in section

2.10 Experimental Development Length  
The  main  derivation  of  the  experimental  development  length  is  based  on  the  methodology  presented in the report by H.R. Khederzadeh et al. (2013). The basic development length is derived using  the experimental results and with the assumption of constant bond stress along the embedded length of  the  FRP  bar  and  for  specimens  that  have  experienced  pullout  failure.  Specimens  that  experienced  in concrete splitting were omitted in the derivation process of the bond factor and the development length  calculations. The basic equilibrium equation derived in a form of:   ! !"  = ! !"                                                                                                                                                     (2.8)  Isolating for the development length, !"  produces the following,   !" =

                                                                                                                                                 (2.9)  

Khederzadel et al. (2013) used the theorem of the average bond strength being a linear function of the  square  root  of  the  concrete  compressive  strength  and  bar  diameter.  Thus,  resulting  to  the  following  expression:   21

! ,is  a  constant,  which  was  assigned  to  investigate  the  other  parameters  that  may  affect  the  bond  stress. Substituting Equation 2.10 into Equation 2.9 provides the final equation used to determine the  basic experimental development length. Substituting the equations yields the following:  !" =

                                                                                                                                                            (2.11)

                                                                                                                                                                     (2.12)  

The purpose of the second constant, ! , is to introduce a bond factor that reflects the effect of the bar  diameter  and  concrete  compressive  strength  when  calculating  the  development  length.  Thus,  by  substituting Equation 2.12 to Equation 2.11, the development length then becomes,  !" =

Khederzadel  et  al.  (2013)  determined  the  bond  constant  for  all  the  specimens  with  Equation  2.14  for  those specimens that experienced pullout bond failure. Bond factors of the lowest of 0.11 and highest of  0.173 were observed. In order to obtain an appropriate value for the ! factor, linear regression analysis  was  conducted  to  obtain  a  single  bond  factor  that  better  represented  the  data  and  would  be  used  to  determine  the  basic  experimental  development  length.  Figure  2.9  illustrates  the  linear  regression  analysis  that  was  carried  out  for  both  straight  and  headed  bars,  and  the  final  modified  bond  factors  were 0.175 and 0.161 for straight and headed VROD GFRP bars, respectively (Khederzadel et al. 2013).

Chapter 3: Experimental Investigation  
3.1 Introduction  
  This  chapter  outlines  the  scope  of  the  research  conducted  and  introduces  the  group  of  specimens and apparatus that were used to obtain the experimental results. The experimental program  also provides details on the pullout test specimens, specimen configuration, material properties, pullout  test procedures, apparatus setup, and acquisition system used during the research process.  

3.2 Experimental Program  
  The  main  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  conduct  a  parametric  study  of  effect  of  different  factors on bond characteristics of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) embedded in high performance  concrete  (HPC)  and  to  determine  experimental  development  lengths.    The  parametric  study  included  factors such as surface treatment, bar diameter, embedment length and concrete cover.  Two types of  GFRP bars were included in this study:  sandcoated GFRP bars and ribbedsurfaced bar. Specifically, for  the sandcoated GFRP bars, an additional factor of the bar's end conditions, straight or with anchorage  head, was included in the parametric study. In total, 145 specimens with straightended GFRP bars, both  sandcoated and ribbedsurfaced, and 45 sandcoated specimens with an anchorage head were casted  and  tested.  For  the  straight  GFRP  bars,  the  four  parameters  were  investigated.  The  effect  of  surface  treatment  on  bond  strength  is  investigated  with  two  different  types  of  GFRP  bars,  which  are  sand coated and ribbedsurfaced. The sandcoated GFRP bars were supplied by TrancelsPultrall Canada Inc.  (VRod)  and  the  ribbedcoated  GFRP  bars  were  provided  by  SchÃ¶ck  Canada  Inc.  (ComBAR).  For  the  straightended  GFRP  bars,  the  effect  of  bar  diameter  is  investigated  with  two  different  bar  diameters.  For the sandcoated GFRP bars, nominal diameters of 15.875 mm and 19.05 mm were used and for the  ribbedsurface  GFRP  bars,  nominal  diameters  of  16  mm  and  20  mm  were  used.  The  effect  of  embedment  length  is  examined  with  three  varying  lengths,  such  as  4  times  the  bar  diameter  (4! ),  6  times the bar diameter (6! ) and 8 times the bar diameter (8! ). For the fourth factor, concrete cover  of 40 mm and 60 mm were used in this study.   As  for  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  with  the  anchorage  head,  only  three  parameters  were  investigated. The effect of bar diameter was examined with two separate bar diameters of 15.875 mm  and 19.050 mm, with anchorage heads of exterior diameters of 47.625 mm and 57.15 mm, respectively.  The effect of embedment length on bond strength was investigated with two different lengths of, firstly,  the length of the anchorage head (0! ) and, secondly, the length of the anchorage head and four times  the  bar  diameter  4! .  A  final  comparison  of  the  bond  strength  was  then  conducted  between  the    24 

sandcoated  GFRP  straight  bars  and  the  headed  bars.  For  all  configurations,  five  duplicate  specimens  were  casted  and  tested.  Table  3.1  and  Table  3.2  summarize  the  investigated  parameters  for  both  straight bars and headed bars.

3.3 Pullout Test Specimen Matrix and Configuration 
  The configuration of the pullout test specimens consisted of GFRP bars embedded into concrete  blocks. For the straightended bars, the concrete specimens had a length and width of 200 mm by 200  mm,  essentially  a  square  base,  and  the  height  of  the  specimen  varied  depending  on  the  embedment  length  that  needed  to  be  installed.  Concrete  cover  of  40  mm  and  60  mm  were  investigated  for  each  configuration  of  embedment  length.  As  for  the  headed  specimens,  the  concrete  blocks  had  a  base  dimension of 300 mm by 300 mm with varying heights due to the varying embedment lengths. Concrete  cover of 40 mm and 60 mm were investigated for each configuration of embedment length. Table 3.3  and  Table  3.4  show  the  embedment  lengths  required  in  the  pullout  test  specimens  for  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  and  ribbedsurfaced  bars,  respectively.  Figure  3.1  and  Figure  3.2  demonstrates  the  pullout  test  specimen  configuration,  which  was  referred  to  during  the  construction  of  the  formwork  and  pre installment of the GFRP bars.

3.4 Materials  
  This section discusses the materials and their properties used for this research and are divided  into subsections to discuss the GFRP bars and HPC.   3.4.1 GFRP Straight Bars    Two types of GFRP bars were selected for this research project:  sandcoated bars provided by 

TrancelsPultrall Canada Inc. (VRod) and ribbedcoated bars provided by SchÃ¶ck Canada Inc. (ComBAR).  For  the  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  provided  by  TrancelsPultrall  Canada  Inc.,  VRODÂ® HM  type  was  used  with a nominal tensile modulus of 60 GPa. #5 GFRP and #6 GFRP were the specific code names for the  15.875 mm and 19.050 mm diameter bars, respectively. All of the VRODÂ® HM bars consisted of a glass  content of 65% in volume. For ribbedcoated GFRP bars provided by SchÃ¶ck Canada Inc., straightended  ComBARÂ®  bars  were  used,  which  have  a  nominal  tensile  modulus  of  60  GPa.  M15  and  M20  were  the  specific  code  names  for  the  16  mm  and  20  mm  core  diameter  bars,  respectively.  For  both  GFRP  bars,  lengths  of  1500  mm  were  used  to  allow  installation  of  a  grip  system  for  testing  the  specimen.  The  technical information for each type of GFRP are presented in Table 3.5 and Table 3.6 and Figure 3.3 in  below  illustrates  the  photos  of  the  different  GFRP  bars  used  for  this  research.  Additionally,  Table  3.7  shows the technical information on the anchorage head for the sandcoated GFRP bar.

3.4.2 Headedend VROD GFRP Bars    VRODÂ® HM  GFRP  bars  with  preinstalled  anchorage  heads  are  supplied  from  TrancelsPultrall 

Canada Inc. The headed VROD GFRP bars with diameter size of #5 GFRP and #6 GFRP were used with a  nominal  tensile  modulus  of  60  GPa.  The  maximum  exterior  diameters  of  the  anchorage  heads  are  3  times  the  diameter  of  the  bar,  with  the  head  length  of  approximately  100  mm.  This  information  is  summarized  in  Table  3.7.  Figure  3.4  shows  an  overview  of  a  VROD  GFRP  bar  with  a  preinstalled  anchorage  head  and  it  can  be  seen  that  the  head  tapers  in  five  steps  to  the  exterior  anchorage  head  diameter. The purpose of the anchorage head is to provide a strong anchoring system and avoid splitting  mechanism around the anchorage head. During the manufacturing process, the length of the GFRP bar  to be installed inside the anchorage head is prepared with grooves around its circumference, which is  shown in Figure 3.5, with the ribbedbar in the middle. This process enables the bar and the anchorage  head  to  achieve  an  adequate  bond  and  to  increase  the  mechanical  interlocking  (Mohamed,  2012).  Figure 3.6 shows an AutoCAD drawing of the bar and anchorage head interface.

3.4.3 HighPerformance Concrete (HPC)    High Performance Concrete (HPC) was used to cast the samples, which was supplied as a ready

mix from St. Mary Canada. Due to the confidentiality agreement with St. Mary's Canada, only minimal  information is provided. The HPC specifically used for this project has a compressive strength of 70 MPa.  Three cylinders with the dimensions of 4 inches in diameter and 8 inches in length were also cast at the  beginning of the concrete pour. Compressive strength tests were conducted after the curing period with  specifications  outlined  by  ASTM  C90013,  Standard  Test  Method  for  Pullout  Strength  of  Hardened  Concrete.  The  compressive  strength  test  results  are  shown  in  Table  3.8  and  the  average  concrete  compressive strengths was calculated as 79.10  .

3.5 Material and Specimen Preparations 
  This  section  provides  detailed  procedures  taken  to  construct  the  formwork  and  preinstall  the  GFRP bars with the proper embedment lengths and concrete cover for the final product used to perform  the pullout tests.   3.5.1 Formwork     The  formwork  for  the  concrete  specimens  was  fabricated  from  3/4 inch  plywood  with  a 

standard  dimension  of  4  inches  by  8  inches.  All  pieces  were  assembled  together  with  screws.  Proper  care was taken to ensure that the screws secured the connecting formwork pieces together to prevent  voids in the formwork for the concrete pour. Before assembling the formwork, holes were drilled in the  plywood so that the longitudinal GFRP bars could be positioned accurately. Proper measurements were  marked on all of the plywood pieces to ensure that all of the GFRP bars were installed accurately and  precisely to match the proposed sketches. Wood boring drill bit sizes of Â¾ inch and 1 inch were used for  16  mm  and  20  mm  diameter  GFRP  bars  respectively  to  ensure  the  bars  did  not  move  during  the  concrete pour. Figure 3.7 below illustrates the final formwork assembly.

Figure 3.8: Moist Resisting Foam 

Prior to the concrete pour, the GFRP bars had to be inserted into the formwork, and there were 

various specific instructions that needed to be followed. It was required that GFRP bars protrude from  the formwork at least 100 mm to ease in handling the specimen and also the extended length allows a  LVDT to be placed at the end (loaded end) to measure the slip of the GFRP bars. All GFRP bars installed  have a length of 1500 mm to allow the gripping system to be installed in the pullout apparatus set up.  The  different  embedment  lengths  were  achieved  by  taping  moistureresistant  foam  on  the  bar  before  inserting the bars in the formwork. The foam also acted as a seal and filled in the gap between the GFRP  bars and the drilled hole in the formwork, which can be seen in Figure 3.8.   3.5.3 GFRP Bar Embedment Lengths    As discussed in previous sections, the embedment lengths of 0!   4!  were investigated for 

the  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  with  the  anchorage  heads,  and  embedment  lengths  of 4! , 6!    8!   were investigated for straightended GFRP bars. Different embedment lengths were achieved by taping  the moistureresistance foam on both sides of the GFRP bars. As seen in Figure 3.9, 50 mm of moisture resistant foam is installed above the required embedment length. Casting the concrete specimen with  just its required embedment length would introduce more human error and the 50 mm coverage aids in  eliminating  uncontrollable  errors  during  the  concrete  pour  and  ensures  that  the  exact  embedment  length was achieved for each specimen. Figure 3.9c illustrates the detailed design of the placement of  the foam to achieve the required embedment length for the specimens.     33

3.5.4 Concrete Casting    The specimens were cast after the final assembly of the formwork and proper installment of the 

GFRP  bars  in  the  formwork.  Concrete  was  poured  into  each  of  the  five  specimens  for  each  block,  and  each specimen was then vibrated to ensure adequate consolidation of the concrete and eliminate any  voids below or around the GFRP bar. After the vibration, the top of the specimens was smoothed out.  This procedure was carried out swiftly and with care to ensure that the readymix concrete did not dry  out and lose its slump. All of the specimens were casted on September 3rd, 2013 during the afternoon.   3.5.5 Concrete Curing     All  of  the  specimens  were  cured  under  the  same  conditions  and  for  the  same  duration.  The 

specimens  were  placed  outdoors,  exposed  to  a  temperature  range  of  2027  degrees  Celsius.  Thus,  burlap sheets were placed over the specimens and were wet twice a day, once in the morning and once  in  the  evening,  to  ensure  minimum  loss  of  moisture  content  and  to  avoid  undesirable  early  stages  of    34 

drying shrinkage. Plastic sheets were placed on top of the specimens after every wetting process of the  burlap sheets. This procedure was followed for 10 days to allow for proper curing of the concrete. All of  the specimens were transferred into the lab by midOctober and the groups of specimens were stripped  from  the  forms  on  a  biweekly  basis.  All  of  the  specimens  were  organized  in  the  lab  in  the  order  of  testing. 

3.6 Pullout Test Setup and Procedures 
  The  pullout  tests  were  performed  once  the  concrete  cylinders  had  reached  the  desired  compressive strength. The following section presents the pullout test set up, apparatus, and procedures  used  to  conduct  the  tests  to  collect  the  required  data  for  analysis,  which  is  presented  in  the  next  chapter.   3.6.1 Pullout Test Setup  The pullout test apparatus can be seen in a sketch in Figure 3.10, and an actual photo of the set up can be seen Figure 3.11. The apparatus consisted of 4 steel plates, a loading cell, and the grip system.  The  steel  plates  have  a  thickness  of  2.5  in.  and  they  were  placed  in  a  position  to  distribute  the  compression  reaction  on  the  specimen  face.  This  reaction  is  shown  in  the  sketch  in  Figure  3.12.  The  loading cell is attached to a computer data acquisition system. An aluminum hollow plunger cylinder is  the main component used to exert the tensile force on the specimen's GFRP bar and the grip system is a  standard wedge type grip system. The wedges have specific grooving patterns to allow full contact with  the  GFRP  bars,  which  help  minimize  localized  transverse  stress  and  reduce  the  chances  of  premature  failure in the bar itself.

  Figure 3.12: Schematic View of Distributed Compression Forces on Specimen    3.6.2 Grip System     The grip system is a standard wedge type setup and is shown in Figure 3.13. The black hollow 

aluminum tube is the support system for the three wedges that are used to grip the GFRP bar. For this  research,  wedges  #5  and  #6  are  specifically  used  for  16/15.875  mm  and  20/19.05  mm  GFRP  bars,  respectively. As mentioned in the previous section, the wedges are grooved so that full contact with the  GFRP bars is achieved. For each specimen, the hollow tube was sprayed with graphite as lubricate for  easy  insert  and  removal  of  the  three  wedges  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  pullout  test.  The  steel  wedges  were  then  carefully  hammered  into  place,  surrounding  the  bar.  It  was  important  that  the  bar  was  in  the  center  and  that  the  steel  wedges  were  equally  spaced  out  so  that  the  bar  will  experience  equal stress all around its circumference. After each test, the residue on the wedges from the previous  bar was cleaned off to ensure proper grip was achieved for the next test.

3.6.3 Computer Data Acquisition System     All  measurements  were  recorded  using  System  8000's  SmartStrain  from  MicroMeasurement. 

Two measurements, freeend slip and loadedend slip, were recorded with Linear Variable Differential  Transformers (LVDTs), whereas the load measurement was recorded with a load cell. The freeend slip  and loadedend slip measurements were recorded with the acquisition system at an excitation of 2 Hz,  while the loading cell scanner was excited with 10 Hz. In Figure 3.14, the highlighted red box shows the  LVDTs used to measure the freeend slip, which was labelled as "Free End on 2", and the loadend slip,  which  was  labelled  as  "Elongation  of  Bar  on  3".  The  load  cell  used  for  recording  the  pullout  load  was  labelled as "Load Cell on 1". The numbering in the labels represents the channel assigned for each data  acquisition.   

The LVDTs had to be carefully positioned at the center of the GFRP bar. A steel bracket and a 16  in. deepthroat bar clamp were used to clamp the LVDT in position and this is shown in Figure 3.15a. As  for  the  loadedend  slip  measurement,  the  LVDT  was  placed  parallel  to  the  grip  system  and  the  measurements  were  taken  with  the  end  of  the  hollow  plunger  cylinder  as  the  reference,  as  shown  in  Figure 3.15b.   Before starting the test, the LVDTs had to be calibrated and checked to determine if they would  present accurate results. A reference object with a known length of 16.6 mm was placed between the  tip of the LVDT and the relative point, and the SmartStrain software should yield out an indicated output  of 16.6 mm and this is shown in Figure 3.14 with a highlighted blue box. This procedure was followed for  every  specimen.  There  were  several  occasions  when  the  software  yielded  out  an  unacceptable  value,  and it was discovered that LVDTs lost its functionality due to wiring issues or the LVDTs had simply worn  out. Thus, this step was very crucial to ensure all data was recorded accurately.

3.6.4 Pullout Test Procedures  The entire pullout test was conducted according to the procedures outlined in this section. The  concrete specimen was horizontally inserted into the experimental setup with the GFRP bar aligned in  the center of the hollow steel tubes, ready for the steel wedges to be inserted in. A flush surface had to  be  established  between  the  face  of  the  concrete  specimen  and  the  supporting  steel  plate,  and  this  automatically centered the bar. These alignments were very important, as it allowed the GFRP bars to  be  pulled  straight  out  from  the  concrete  specimen.  The  grip  system  was  lubricated  with  graphite  to  allow the wedges to be inserted with ease, and the spaces between the wedges were equally spaced to  allow  constant  stress  to  be  applied  on  the  bar  when  the  specimen  was  being  pulled  out.    The  LVDTs  were  then  secured  in  placed  and  the  acquisition  system  was  calibrated  before  the  commencement  of  the experimental testing.     After application of 15kN of load, the concrete specimen had positioned itself against the steel 

plate.  This  position  was  maintained  until  the  ultimate  tensile  load.  After  failure,  any  surface  cracks  on  the  concrete  specimen  were  marked  with  a  marker.  As  for  the  samples  where  the  bar  experienced 

 

38 

slippage, they were placed aside and later cut in half to permit a visual review of the slippage within the  concrete specimen.     After  each  failure,  the  type  of  bond  failure  was  recorded  and  photos  were  taken.  After  every 

completed test, the bond failure mode was visually inspected and recorded.  

3.7 Specimen Notations  
The specimens were labeled with ascending letters and numbers that represented the varying  embedment lengths and the different cover lengths. For the sake of simplicity and future referencing in  the report, the specimens were labeled with the same notation format as presented in the tables in the  Appendix. For example, for the specimen notation of S5C64SCHOCK:  Â· Â· The letter S, represents the GFRP bar's straight end   The number 5, represents the diameter of the GFRP bar, where "5" represents 15.875 mm for V ROD and 16 mm for SchÃ¶ck bars and "6" represents 19.05 mm for VROD and 20 mm for SchÃ¶ck  bars.   Â· Â· C, represents the bar position, which is placed concentrically   "64" in the third position represents the embedment length

Chapter 4: Experimental Results and Analysis   
4.1 Introduction 
  This  chapter  presents  the  pullout  test  results  attained  from  the  experiments  on  GFRP  bars  embedded  in  highperformance  concrete  blocks.    The  effects  of  a  few  parameters  on  the  bond  properties of GFRP are also discussed in this section. For the specimens with the straightend GFRP bars,  four parameters are analyzed to evaluate their influences on the bond strength, namely: bar size, type  of bar surface, concrete cover to the bar and bar embedment length. As for the sandcoated specimens  with anchorage heads, the effects of bar size, concrete cover to the bar and bar embedment length on  the  bond  strength  is  presented.  Bondslip  relationships  are  presented  to  elaborate  on  the  bond  properties.  In  the  final  sections,  the  experimental  development  length  is  determined  and  is  compared  with the minimum required development length provided by design codes.  

4.2 Pullout Test Specimen Results 
  In total, 145 specimens with straightend GFRP bars, both sandcoated and ribbedsurfaced, and  45 sandcoated specimens with an anchorage head, were cast and tested to failure. For the specimens  with straightend GFRP bars, four modes of bond failure occurred. For the sandcoated specimens with  the  anchorage  heads,  two  modes  of  bond  failure  and  three  types  of  anchorage  head  damage  were  experienced. The modes of bond failure are separated into subsections for the specimens with straight end  and  with  headed  end.  Table  A  in  Appendix  A  summarizes  the  failure  modes,  pullout  force  and  calculated bon stress for all tested specimens.  4.2.1 Pullout Test Specimen Results for StraightEnd GFRP bars    Test  results  showed  that  GFRP  bars  located  at  the  center  of  the  concrete  blocks  experienced 

two  failure  modes,  namely:  pure  bar  pullout  of  concrete  (BP)  and  bar  slippage  followed  by  concrete  block  splitting  (BSCS).  Figure  4.1  shows  the  photos  of  these  failure  modes  after  testing.  Most  of  the  specimens experienced concrete splitting after initial bar slip, which is an indication of adequate bond  between the GFRP bar and the surrounding concrete inside the specimen. For example, specimens with  the bar positioned concentrically with a diameter of 20 mm and embedment length of 6! , S6C114V,  experienced a bar pullout initially and the pullout load swiftly dropped to 0  . When loaded again, the  load  reached  to  a  value  10%  lower  than  the  first  applied  load  and  was  able  to  sustain  this  load  for  a  short period of time before concrete splitting failure occurred.         40

Figure 4.1: Failure Modes for Concrete Blocks with Concentric GFRP Bar 
 

For  concrete  blocks  with  concentrically  positioned  GFRP  ribbedsurface  bar  of  16  mm  diameter,  concrete  blocks  with  embedment  length  of  4db  experienced  pure  bar  pullout  failure,  whereas  specimens with embedment length of 6db   and  8db experienced bar slippage followed by concrete block  splitting. The specimens that experienced pure bar pullout failure required the most time to reach to its  ultimate  load.  Once  the  ultimate  load  was  reached,  the  load  immediately  drops  to  zero  due  to  the  shearing  of  the  ribs  and  the  core  bar  as  depicted  in  Figure  4.1(a).  Specimens  of  embedment  length  of  4db and 8db  for sandcoated GFRP bars failed due to bar slippage, followed by concrete splitting (BSCS)  as depicted in Figure 4.1(b), except one specimen with 4db embedment length as depicted in Table A1a.  For  specimens  with  embedment  length  of 6db ,  pure  bar  pullout  occurred  at  failure  (BP)  with  shear  failure at the interface between the sandcoating and the core diameter of the bar which can be seen in  Figure  4.1(a).  As  for  the  20mm  diameter  bars,  results  reported  in  Table  A1b  showed  that  specimens  with  different  embedment  lengths  for  the  ribbedsurface  and  sandcoated  bars  failed  due  to  bar  slippage followed by concrete splitting. The only exception was the case of embedment length of 4db for  the ribbedsurface bar on which the failure mode was pure bar pullout.

43 

Figures  4.2  to  4.3  demonstrate  typical  failure  modes  for  concrete  blocks  with  40  mm  and  60  mm  eccentric  GFRP  bars.  For  these  two  groups,  bar  slippage  followed  by  concrete  cover  crack  was  the  dominating  failure  mode.  Observed  bar  slippage  (BS)  followed  by  concrete  cover  crack  patterns  were  designated herein as side concrete cover crack (BSSCCC), vnotch concrete cover crack (BSVCCC), and  diagonal concrete cover crack (BSDCC). During the visual inspection of these two groups of specimens,  it was noted that specimens with embedment length of 4db  of the ribbedsurface GFRP bar with 40 mm  concrete cover and specimens with embedment length of 6db  of the sandcoated GFRP bar with 60 mm  concrete  cover  deviated  from  this  trend  by  having  a  failure  mode  of  pure  bar  pullout.  Tables  41c  through A1e summarize the failure modes for each specimen with eccentric bar location.   Figures  4.4(a)  and  4.4(b)  show  concrete  splitting  failure  for  both  the  ribbedsurface  bar  and  the  sandcoated  bar,  respectively,  along  with  views  of  the  bar  surface  along  the  embedment  length  after  failure. For sandcoated bars, the surface of the bar was left bare. The sand particles and the membrane  are  completely  stripped  off  as  the  specimen  failed  in  concrete  splitting.  For  majority  of  the  ribbed surface  GFRP  bars,  the  ribbedsurface  completely  stripped  from  the  bar  near  the  loaded  end,  with  portion of the surface remaining intact further away from the loaded end.  Comparing the two types of  GFRP  bars,  the  sandcoated  surface  bars  experienced  complete  stripping  of  both  the  membrane  and  sand  particles,  whereas  the  ribbedsurface  GFRP  bars  experienced  partial  stripping  of  the  ribs  off  the  surface. It was also noted that some of the ribs were sheared off, but not completely ripped off.   The sand particles on the GFRP bars are the main component that attributes to the bond behaviour  between GFRP bars and the concrete. The sand particles on the bar provide frictional forces as a load is  being applied to it, and provide a relatively higher surface area for the surrounding concrete to adhere  to  it.  The  bare  stripping  of  the  bar  and  the  concrete  split  failure  explains  that  there  was  a  successful  bonding mechanism between the sand particles and the surrounding concrete, which also resulted in a  higher average ultimate load. However, the bond failure was very abrupt and brittle in most cases. As  for  the  ribbedsurface  bar,  the  successively  ribbed  geometry  on  the  bar  is  responsible  for  the  bond  properties. The surrounding concrete fills in the trough between the rib crests to provide an interlocking  mechanism.

Figure 4.4: Straight GFRP bar slippage followed by concrete splitting failure, showing shear failure at  the ribbar interface for ribbed and at the sand coatingbar interface in case of sandcoated bars    4.2.2 Pullout Test Specimen Results for the Headed GFRP bars  Figures  4.5  and  4.6  show  the  failure  modes  for  concrete  blocks  with  concentric  and  eccentric  sandcoated GFRP bars with headed ends, respectively.    For the concrete blocks with concentrically positioned GFRP bars, the common failure mode was  either  bar  slippage  from  the  head  (BS)  or  bar  head  breakage  followed  by  bar  slippage  and  concrete  splitting  (HBBSCS)  as  depicted  in  Figure  4.5.  In  the  first  stage,  as  the  ultimate  load  is  achieved,  the  anchorage head ruptures due to the wedging effect that the anchorage head produces followed by bar  slippage.  Then,  concrete  splitting  occurs  to  the  specimen.  As  for  concrete  blocks  with  eccentric  GFRP  bars, three common failure modes were noted, namely: bar slippage from the anchorage head followed  by concrete splitting (BSCS) as depicted in Figure 4.6(a), bar slippage from the anchorage head followed  by  a  Vnotch  side  concrete  crack  (BSVSCCC)  ad  depicted  in  Figure  4.6b,  and  bar  slippage  from  the  anchorage head and concrete cover splitting (BSCCS), shown in Figure 4.6c.        45

b) Bar Head Breakage through Longitudinal Crack followed by Bar Slippage  and Concrete Splitting (HBBSCS) 

Figure 4.5: Failure Modes for Concrete Blocks with 60 mm Concentric GFRP with SandCoated Surface     During  the  analysis  of  the  surface  condition  of  headedend  bars  installed  concentrically  in  the  concrete block, two types of failure were observed in the bar head. The first type of failure happened  when  the  bar  head  is  broken  at  the  largest  desk  near  the  bar  end,  as  depicted  in  4.5a,  at  a  force  exceeding the tensile rupture strength of the material forming the head, followed by concrete splitting.  The second type of deformation is when the bar slips from the anchorage head at a force exceeding the  shear  strength  between  the  bar  itself  and  anchorage  head,  causing  a  longitudinal  crack  in  the  head,  followed by concrete splitting through the entire specimen as depicted in Figure 4.5b.  The length of the  anchorage  head  serves  a  similar  role  as  the  embedment  length  of  straight  bars.  Also,  the  anchorage  head provides an additional wedging effect that allows the headed specimens to achieve similar bond  strength to straightended specimens with longer embedment lengths. Thus, this finding confirms that  the anchorage head provides adequate adhesive bond properties and is the main component to achieve  the successful bond mechanism.

During  the  analysis  of  the  surface  condition  of  headedend  bars  installed  eccentrically  in  the  concrete block, three types of failure were observed in the bar head. The first type of failure is depicted  in Figure 4.6 on which the bar slips from the head followed by concrete splitting. The left image in Figure  4.6a  shows  the  portion  of  the  bar  to  the  right  of  head  slipped  off  the  head  as  identified  by  the  appearance of Orings introduced to the bar by the manufacturer to provide bond between the bar core  and the cast head. Also, the image shows that the straight portion of the embedment length outside the  bar has the sandcoating sheared off the bar core as an indication of bar slippage. Similar observation is  depicted  in  right  image  in  Figure  4.6b.  The  second  and  third  failure  modes  shown  in  Figures  4.6b  and  4.6c are identical to the first failure mode depicted in Figure 4.6a except that concrete splitting was due  to Vnotch side concrete cover crack and concrete cover splitting, respectively.     

4.3 Experimental Results for StraightEnded Specimens: Effect of Controlling  Parameters on Bond Stress 
  Tables  A1  and  A2  in Appendix  A  include the recorded  maximum  pullout  load,  along with  the  loadedend  slip  and  freeend  slip  measurements.  The  fifth  column  in  the  table  provides  the  type  of  failure  that  each  specimen  experienced,  which  were  visually  examined  and  noted  after  testing  each  specimen. From these tables, it can be seen that some values may have a large variance from the other  identical  specimens  and  it  may  be  due  to  experimental  errors  and  unexpected  failure,  which  will  be  discussed  in  later  sections.  Tables  A1  and  A2  also  present  the  recorded  ultimate  load  for  each  specimen  in  each  specimen.  The  bond  stress  reported  in  the  last  column  of  these  tables  is  calculated  with  Equation  4.1  and  is  averaged  with  the  duplicate  specimens  and  plotted  with  the  controlling  parameters for analysis. It should be noted that some specimens failed prematurely so that there were  excluded from Table A.    =                                                                                                                                                                   ( 4 .1 )    ! !"

Where   is the bond stress, T is the experimental failure load, db is the bar diameter, and ldb is the bar  development length. It should be noted that bar development length in case of headedend bar is the  sum of the head length and the straight portion of the bar if bonded to concrete.

4.3.1 Experimental Results: Effect of GFRP Bar's Surface Treatment on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress  Results reported in Table A showed that a higher ultimate load was achieved with the bars that  were  sandcoated  compared  to  those  with  ribbedsurface.  This  relationship  can  be  explained  by  observing the ultimate load and the failure mode of the specimens with an embedment length of 64 mm  diameter bar positioned concentrically (i.e. S5C64SchÃ¶ck & S5C64VROD). Figure 4.7a presents such  finding  through  the  average  ultimate  load  of  #5  GFRP  bars plotted  with  increasing  embedment  length  for  the  concentric  samples.  This  phenomenon  can  be  described  by  the  studies  of  Morales  Arias  et  al.  (2012),  where  the  sandcoated  surface  of  GFRP  bars  provides  a  larger  surface  area  of  contact  for  surrounding concrete to bond with when compared to ribbedsurface. Figure 4.7b presents the average  bond stress versus the embedment length for the same two groups of specimens. A similar trend can be  seen,  where  the  sandcoated  specimens  produced  a  relatively  higher  bond  stress  than  the  ribbed surface specimens.

Figure 4.7: Effect of Surface Treatment on a) Ultimate Load and b) Bond Stress    4.3.2 Experimental Results: Effect of Embedment Length on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress    As  mentioned  in  the  previous  chapter,  three  embedment  lengths  of  4! , 6! ,   8! were  implemented  with  straight  ended  GFRP  bars.  In  Figure  4.8,  the  most  obvious  trend  is  the  increase  of  average ultimate load with increase in the embedment length. However, the rate of increase in ultimate  load  with  increase  in  embedment  length  is  scattered  when  considering  concentric  or  eccentric  bars,  irrespective  of  the  surface  type  of  the  GFRP  bars.    Figure  4.9  demonstrates  the  effect  of  embedment  length on the average bond stress. Overall, the trend lines demonstrate a decline of bond strength with  increasing embedment length. This trend verifies the findings from researchers' experimental results, as  discussed in Chapter 2. This can be explained by the nonlinear distribution of bond stresses along the    49 

GFRP bar within the concrete when the specimen is subjected to tensile force. To compare the effect of  embedment  length  on  the  average  bond  stress  between  SchÃ¶ck  and  VROD  specimens,  reference  is  made to the groups of specimens with bars concentrically position with bar diameter of #5, dark blue  trend  lines  in  Figure  4.9a  and  Figure  4.9b.    However,  this  trend  is  altered  in  few  samples  with  larger  diameter (i.e. #6 bars). This may be attributed to the type of failure that changed from one group to the  other.

4.3.3 Experimental Results: Effect of GFRP Bar Diameter on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress     Figure  4.10  show  the  effect  of  bar  diameter  on  the  average  ultimate  load  with  specimens 

separated by the bar's surface treatment. For VROD specimens Figure 4.10a, the trend of the change in  ultimate load with increase in bar diameter is rather scattered as half of the trend lines demonstrate an  increase of average ultimate load with an increase in bar diameter, and vice versa for the other half of  the  specimens.  Similar  trend  lines  were  produced  for  the  group  of  SchÃ¶ck  specimens.  Figure  4.11  demonstrates  the  relationship  between  the  bar  diameter  and  the  bond  stress.  It  can  be  seen  that  for  both sandcoated and ribbedsurfaced specimens, lower bond strength is produced as the bar diameter  increases. As presented by Baena et al. (2008), this relationship is expected to govern for all specimens  with  straightend  bars  due  to  the  migration  of  stress  from  the  loaded  end  of  the  bar  to  the  unloaded  end,  which  results  in  a  lower  average  bond  strength.  In  addition,  Baena  et  al.  (2008)  explained  the  increase of Poisson effect is more pronounced with increasing bar diameter.

4.3.4 Experimental Results: Effect of Concrete Cover on Ultimate Load       The relationship between the concrete cover and ultimate load has been analyzed based on the 

concrete splitting failure of the specimens. Figures 4.12 through 4.15 illustrate the relationship between  the average ultimate load, average bond stress, and concrete cover. The effect of concrete cover on the  ultimate  load  showed  scattered  trend.  For  example,  for  the  group  of  SchÃ¶ck  ComBAR  specimens,  the  trend  lines  tend  to  concave  downwards,  demonstrating  that  a  concrete  cover  of  60  mm  provided  the  higher average ultimate load, which is shown in Figure 4.12a. Whereas for groups of VROD specimens  (Figure 4.12b), the trend lines concaves upwards, indicating that a concrete cover of 60 mm produced a  lower  average  ultimate  load.  Thus,  these  two  graphs  are  not  good  representations  of  the  effect  of  concrete  cover  on  the  average  ultimate  load.  Although,  scattered  results  are  still  depicted  in  the  relationship  between  the  average  bond  stress  and  concrete  cover,  as  shown  in  Figures  4.14  and  4.15,  some of the graphs lends towards the expected results presented by Ametrano (2011). For example, in  Figure 4.14a, the trend lines for 4!  and 6!  converges to the findings presented by Ametrano, where  the average bond stress increases with concrete cover. Similar trends can be seen in Figure 4.14b and  Figure 4.15b.

4.3.5 Summary of the Variables' Influence on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress for StraightEnded  Specimens    Through  sections  4.3.1  to  4.3.4,  each  of  the  controlling  variables'  experimental  results  were 

analyzed  to  determine  how  it  influences  the  average  ultimate  load,  bond  stress,  and  the  governing  failure  mode.  Overall,  the  parametric  studies  demonstrated  good  convergence  towards  other  researchers'  findings,  which  were  discussed  in  the  literature  review.  As  a  summary,  the  experimental  results demonstrated the following relationships:  Â· Sandcoated  GFRP  bars  (VROD)  resulted  in  higher  average  ultimate  load  and  bond  stress  relative to the ribbedcoated GFRP bars (SchÃ¶ck ComBAR). This is due to the additional physical  bond  from  the  sand  particles  that  VROD  GFRP  bars  provided.  However,  most  specimens  experienced brittle and abrupt failure after ultimate pullout load was achieved.  Â· In general, a gradual drop in bond stress was experienced with increasing embedment length.  Which is similar to the behaviour experienced in other researchers' findings, such as Firas et al.  (2009).   Â· The effect of bar diameter on the average ultimate load produced rather scattered results and  was  not  appropriate  to  generalize  any  sort  of  relationship.  As  for  its  effect  on  average  bond  stress,  overall,  an  increase  in  bar  diameter  led  to  a  drop  in  bond  stress,  which  validates  the  expected behaviour of this phenomenon.   Â· Overall,  the  increase  of  concrete  cover  yielded  scattered  results.  However,  a  few  results  did  demonstrate a convergence towards expected relationship

4.4 Experimental Results for Headed Specimens: Effect of Controlling Parameters on  Bond Stress 
  Table A2 in the Appendix includes the recorded maximum pullout load and the loadedend slip  and freeend measurements for specimens with preinstalled sandcoated GFRP bars. The effect of three  controlling  parameters  were  analyzed  and  related  to  the  average  ultimate  load  and  bond  stress.  The  three controlling parameters include the embedment length, bar diameter and concrete cover. Each of  the  variables  are  analyzed  and  discussed  in  the  following  sections.  The  bond  stress  is  calculated  with  Equation 4.1 and is averaged with the duplicate specimens and plotted with the controlling parameters  for analysis. There are only two embedment lengths, 0!  and 4! , installed for the specimens with the  anchorage  heads.  In  order  to  calculate  the  bond  stress,  the  total  embedment  length  is  initially  calculated. Figure 4.16 demonstrates how the total embedment length of headed bars is calculated. The  total embedment length includes both the length of the anchorage head and the installed embedment  length.  Few  specimens  failed  due  to  pure  bar  pullout  of  bar  slippage  followed  by  side  concrete  cover  splitting were sliced at the head location to show the amount of slip of bar from the end of head. The  sliced blocks are demonstrated in Figure 4.19.   
   

Figure 4.16: Total Embedment Length of Headed Bars  ((Source: SchÃ¶ck ComBARÂ®, April 2013)    4.4.1 Effect of Embedment Length on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress     Figure 4.17a illustrates the relationship between the average ultimate load and the embedment 

length.  By analyzing the trend lines, it can observe that the average ultimate load generally increases  with an increasing embedment length. Figure 4.17b demonstrates the relationship between the average  bond  stress  and  embedment  length.  It  can  be  seen  that  bond  stress  decreases  with  increase  in  bar  embedment length.

The results are rather scattered with increase in bar  diameter  as  a  result  of  change  in  bar  locations.  For  example,  concentric  samples  demonstrated  an  increasing  trend  in  the  average  ultimate  load  and  average  bond  stress.  As  for  specimens  with  an  eccentricity of 40 mm, a decline of both average ultimate load and bond stress is shown for increase in  bar diameter.

Figure 4.18: Effect of Bar Diameter on a) Average Ultimate Load and b) Average Bond Stress    4.4.3 Effect of Concrete Cover on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress     Figures  4.20  and  4.21  illustrate  the  effect  of  the  concrete  cover  on  the  average  ultimate  load  and  average  bond  stress,  respectively.    In  Figures  4.20a  and  4.21a,  the  red  trend  line  represents  the  group of specimens with the length of the anchorage head as the total embedment length, labeled as  0! . The blue trend line represents the group of specimens with an embedment length of4! , plus the  length of the anchorage head. Results show that the ultimate load decreases with increase in concrete    56 

cover over 60 mm while the trend is altered when the concrete cover is 40 mm. This may be attributed  to the mode of failure associated with each amount of concrete cover. On the other hand, Figures 4.20b  and 4.21b show that bond stress increases with increase in concrete cover. Recall that from the studies  conducted by Tighiouart et al. (1998 and 1999), for a larger bar diameter, it is more prone for bleeding  of  water  to  accumulate,  creating  interfacial  transition  zones  (ITZ)  around  the  GFRP  bar that  reduce  its  bond to the surrounding concrete. It is suggested the ITZ avoided the possible pullout of the GFRP bar  from the anchorage head as less stress is accumulated on the GFRP bar and the anchorage head, and  resulted in concrete splitting for the concentric specimens.    Figure 4.19 demonstrates the different concrete cover and the resulted GFRP bar slip from the 

anchorage head. It can easily be seen that a relatively pronounce slip exist for the concentric specimens.

4.4.4 Summary of the Variables' Influence on Ultimate Load and Bond Stress for Headed bar  Specimens   Through sections 4.4.1 to 4.2.3, each of the controlling variables' experimental results have been  analyzed to determine how they influence the average ultimate load and bond stress. As a summary, the  experimental results demonstrated the following relationships:  Â· Similar to straightend bars, with the increase in bar embedment length, results show scattered  results  due  to  the  change  in  failure  mode.  In  most  of  the  tested  samples,  the  ultimate  load  increases with increase in bar embedment length. Similar observations were observed in case  of the change in ultimate load and bond stress with the change in bar diameter as well as the  concrete cover to the bar  Â· The effect of the bar diameter on average ultimate load and bond stress is rather scattered and  did not converge to expected results  Â· Overall,  higher  average  bond  stress  resulted  with  increasing  concrete  cover,  which  supports  researchers'  findings  and  the  expected  results.  Also,  figures  demonstrated  that  a  larger  concrete cover exhibit a relatively larger bar slip within the anchorage head 

4.5 Bond Behaviour Comparison: StraightEnd Versus HeadedEnd Specimens 
  The  previous  two  sections  covered  the  effect  of  each  factor  on  the  average  ultimate  load  and  bond  stress.  The  results  have  shown  a  few  resemblances  between  the  groups  of  specimens.  From  experimental findings, the anchorage heads can adequately be used to replace traditional exposure of  the  bar  to  achieve  required  embedment  lengths.  From  Tables  A1  and  A2,  it  can  be  seen  that  a  relatively  high  average  ultimate  load  was  achieved.  Unlike  the  straightend  GFRP  bars,  the  anchorage  head provides a different bonding mechanism with the surrounding concrete. The anchorage head has  an  increasing  diameter  along  the  length  up  to  the  maximum  exterior  diameter,  and  it  created  an  additional wedging effect. This allowed the headed specimens to produce higher bond strength similar  to  those  with  straightend  bars,  with  a  significantly  smaller  embedment  length.  In  terms  of  the  bond  failure,  the  headedend  specimens  produced  similar  concrete  splitting  mechanism  as  the  straightend  specimens.  However,  when  these  specimens  failed,  the  surrounding  concrete  exploded  destructively.  The  failures  were  rather  brittle  and  destructive  damages  on  the  head  portion  were  experienced,  as  shown in subsection 4.2.2.  

 

59 

4.6 Load and Slip Relationship 
The load and slip relationships for the groups of specimens are graphically shown in Figures 4.22  to  4.25.  The  bond  strengths  are  plotted  against  the  freeend  slip,  in  millimeters,  for  different  types  of  GFRP bars and embedment lengths.   The bond stress versus slip is graphed for concentric samples with increasing embedment length  and  the  same  bar  diameter  for  both  sandcoated  and  ribbedsurfaced  specimens,  and  is  shown  in  Figures 4.22a and 4.22b. It can be seen that the increase of embedment length results in a reduction of  the average bond stress, which validates the expected results described in section 4.5. Thus, at the same  slip value, the bond stress is less for those specimens with the larger embedment length. In Figure 4.22a,  the ribbedsurface group of specimens experienced a gradual decrease of bond stress and this is due to  the  bar  slip  failure.  Figure  4.22b  illustrates  a  sudden  loss  of  bond  stress  for  the  group  of  sandcoated  specimens  and  this  is  due  to  concrete  splitting  bond  failure.  As  for  specimens  with  straight,  ribbed surfaced GFRP bars positioned with a concrete cover of 60 mm,  the  relationship is represented in the  graph shown in Figure 4.23. The trend lines are very similar to those in Figure 4.22b, also indicating that  these  groups  of  specimens  have  experienced  a  concrete  splitting  bond  failure.  For  all  three  graphs,  significantly larger slips were experienced for the specimens that experienced concrete splitting, which  is  due  to  the  large  movement  of  the  LVDT  behind  the  specimens.  Some  specimens  even  experienced  explosive concrete splitting failure that caused the LVDT to detach itself from the specimens, leading to  large freeend slip values.   For the headedend specimens, a similar trend can also be seen.  The specimens with just the  length of the anchorage head as embedment length experienced bond stress that is larger than those  with  both  the  headed  end  and  length  of 4! as  the  total  embedment  length  used.  This  validates  the  analysis  on  the  effect  of  embedment  lengths  on  bond  stress  for  headedend  bar  specimens.  Figures  4.24a  and  4.24b  show  the  bond  stress  versus  slip  for  sandcoated  groups  of  specimens  with  a  bar  diameter of 15.875 mm and concrete covers of 125 mm (concentric) and 40 mm, respectively. The trend  lines in these graphs show a gradual decline of bond stress, verifying the slip of the GFRP bar from the  anchorage  heads.  Specifically  in  Figure  4.24b,  a  gradual  decrease  of  bond  stress  was  followed  by  a  sudden loss of bond stress. The trend lines that exhibit this pattern indicate a slip of the GFRP bar from  the  anchorage,  followed  by  a  global  concrete  spitting  failure.  Figure  4.25  illustrates  more  examples  of  groups of specimens that initially experienced bar slip from the anchorage followed by concrete splitting  bond failure.

Chapter 5: Comparative Analysis of Experimental Development Length and Code  Requirements   
5.1 Introduction 
  This  chapter  presents  the  calculation  of  the  required  development  lengths  based  on  the  experimental  study  for  both  sandcoated  and  ribbedsurface  GFRP  bars.  From  the  experimental  test  results, bond factors are derived for both straight and headed GFRP bars, which are used to determine  the basic required development length. A comparison is conducted between the development lengths  derived from the experimental results and the code requirements.  

5.2 Basic Development Length  
As  discussed  in  Chapter  2,  the  basic  development  length  equation  is  derived  based  on  the  assumption of constant bond stress along the embedded length in the concrete subjected to a pullout  force (Khederzadeh et al., 2013). The basic development length equation is calculated as follows:  !" =
!! !! !!
! !!

                                                                                                                                                          (5.1) 

Where ! , bond factor constant is represented as,

                                                                                                                                                                    (5.2)

Where  , is the average ultimate load recorded from the experiment.   For  the  straightend  specimens,  all  results  reported  in  Table  A1  in  Appendix  A  were  used  to  develop the bond factor constant, C2, and development length, Ld, as shown in Table 5.1. For the headed  end specimens, all results reported in Table A2 in Appendix A were used to develop the bond factor  constant, C2, and development length, Ld, as shown in Table 5.1.  A linear regression analysis is conducted  after the calculation of both the bond factor and development length to obtain a single, modified basic  development length equation.         63

Table 5.4 includes the values for each parameter used in Equation 5.4 for each bar size and different  GFRP bars used in this study.

As mentioned previously, !"  is the distance from the concrete surface to the center of the bar.  However, !"  cannot be greater than 2.5! .  As seen in Tables 5.4 and 5.5, the denominator is taken as  the  limit.  Additionally, !!  used  to  calculate !"  cannot  be  greater  than  64  MPa,  which  resulted  in  3.2  MPa that was used to determine the development lengths of the specimens shown in Table 5.6.

5.3.2 CSA S80612 Development Length    The development length equation for FRP bars provided by the CSA S80612 is presented below.   ! = 1.15! ! ! ! ! !" + !" ! !!     !

Similarly, !"  in Tables 5.7 and 5.8 shows different values from the distance from the center of the bar  to the closest concrete surface and it can be seen that all values were greater than two times the bar  diameter.  Additionally,  !! cannot  be  greater  than  8  MPa,  which  was  taken  into  account  when  calculating  the  development  length.  As  a  result,  the  development  lengths  in  Table  5.9  lean  toward  a  conservative side and increase the amount of development length required.

Overall,  CSA  S80612  produced  the  highest  development  length.  This  demonstrates  that  the  design  codes  and  provisions  provide  a  much  greater  minimum  requirement  of  development  length  for  GFRP  bars to provide an adequate level of margin of safety.

5.4 Experimental Errors 
There were inevitable and avoidable errors that were encountered during this research process.  The  inevitable  errors  are  those  in  the  experimental  stages.  Pullout  tests  are  destructive  and  many  specimens experienced significant concrete splitting that skewed some of the readings recorded by the  LVDTs.  The  LVDTs  were  very  sensitive  and  gave  irrelevant  and  skewed  readings  when  the  specimen  experienced concrete splitting and broken concrete pieces perturbed and made contact with the LVDTs.     Overall,  the  experimental  results  were  fairly  consistent  and  as  discussed  in  the  previous 

sections, the majority of the results validated other researchers' findings, which were mentioned in the  literature review. As recommendations, it is preferable to have a stable and standard pullout apparatus  that could potentially ease the experimental processes and procedures.  

5.5 Conclusion of Experimental Results 
The experimental results were used to analyze the four controlling variables for straightended  specimens  and  the  three  controlling  variables  for  the  headedend  specimens  that  played  a  significant  role in the bond mechanisms, properties, and bond failure modes of GFRP bars cast in HPC. The sand coated  (VROD)  GFRP  bar  developed  bond  strengths  with  frictional  forces,  while  the  ribbedsurface  (SchÃ¶ck  ComBAR)  GFRP  bar  used  mechanical  interlock.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  sandcoated  GFRP  bar  specimens produced higher range of bond strength; however, it is accompanied by brittle and sudden  failure.    As  for  the  headedend  specimens,  the  anchorage  head  provided  an  additional  wedging  effect  that enabled the specimens to achieve similar bond strength as the straightend GFRP bars achieved, but  with much smaller embedment lengths. The basic experimental development lengths were determined  based on the assumption that constant stress was achieved along the embedded length of the GFRP bar  for  all  specimens.  After  a  comparative  analysis,  it  was  determined  that  the  minimum  required  development  length  provided  by  design  codes  and  provisions  resulted  in  a  larger  development  length  than  the  experimental  development  length,  thus  a  fairly  high  discrepancy  between  the  experimental  and the theoretical development lengths was observed.

Chapter 6: Conclusions  
6.1 General  
  This research project consisted of a parametric study of the effect of the controlling variables on  the  bond  behaviour  of  two  different  GFRP  bar  types  cast  in  highperformance  concrete  (HPC)  with  a  compressive  strength  of  79.1  MPa,  and  to  determine  the  basic  experimental  development  lengths.  Pullout  test  was  conducted  during  the  experimental  investigation,  the  controlling  variables,  including:  bar diameter, concrete cover dimensions, type of GFRP bar and the surface treatment of the bar, were  investigated  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  experimental  results.  A  comparative  analysis  was  conducted  between  the  experimental  development  length  and  the  prescribed  equations  provided  by  both  the  CHBDC 200, CSA S806. The experimental findings discuss in this report is summarized in the following  conclusions:  Â· Two different surfacetreated GFRP bars cast in HPC, namely: sandcoated (VROD) and ribbed surface  (SchÃ¶ck  ComBAR)  were  used  in  this  research  project.  The  sandcoated  GFRP  bars  resulted in higher average bond stress and average ultimate load relative to the ribbedsurface  GFRP bars as a result of the physical bond that the sand particles provided leading to an increase  in  frictional  stresses  with  the  bar  core,  compared  to  the  bearing  stress  on  the  ribs  in  case  of  ribbedsurface bars.   Â· The  effects  of  embedment  length  on  bond  strength  results  were  similar  to  other  researchers'  findings.  As  the  embedment  length  increases  from 6!  to 8! , it  can  be  seen  that  the  bond  strength  decrease.  This  behaviour  is  explained  by  the  nonuniform  distribution  of  stress  along  the  bar  as  the  GFRP  bar  is  subjected  to  increasing  tensile  forces.    As  for  the  headedend  bar  specimens,  scattered  data  showed  uneven  trend  as  a  result  of  the  head  breakage  and  bar  slippage from the head.   Â· For  most  of  the  specimens  with  preinstalled  straightend  GFRP  bars,  the  increase  in  bar  diameter  was  accompanied  by  a  decrease  in  the  bond  strength.  It  was  established  that  an  increase of bar diameter, decreases the bond strength due to Poisson effect as discussed in the  research  done  by  Firas  et  al.  (2009).    As  for  the  headedend  bar  specimens,  scattered  data  showed uneven trend as a result of the head breakage and bar slippage from the head.   Â· For the straightend specimens, experimental results showed a slight increase in bond strength  as the concrete cover increases from 40 to 60 mm. It was expected that specimens with GFRP  bars preinstalled concentrically would produce higher bond strength; however, there were few 

 

72 

cases where this was not the case and resulted in minor scattered plots. As for the headedend  bar specimens, scattered data showed uneven trend as a result of the head breakage and bar  slippage from the head.   Â· The  basic  experimental  development  length  was  determined  for  all  successfully  tested  specimens experiencing pullout bond failure or bar slippage followed by concrete splitting crack.  The  basic  development  length  was  determined  under  the  assumption  of  constant  bond  stress  along the embedded length in concrete subjected to a pullout force. Linear regression analysis  was  conducted  to  obtain  an  appropriate  bond  factor  constant, ! ,  which  was  incorporated  in  the  development  equation.  A  comparison  between  the  experimental  and  design  code's  development  length  was  conducted  and  it  was  concluded  that  the  design  codes  and  provision  provide a significantly greater minimum requirement of development length for GFRP to provide  an adequate level of margin of safety.  

6.2 Recommendations for Future Work  
This research has expanded our knowledge of the use of different surfacetreated GFRP bars in  HPC  materials  that  can  potentially  be  used  in  the  joints  of  precast  bridge  decks.  However,  there  is  definitely more research in this area still required to expand the knowledge in this topic. The following  are some recommendations for future research:  Â· Conduct  beam  tests  to  determine  more  reliable  GFRP  bar  bond  strength  and  development lengths.   Â· Â· Conduct longterm creep tests on GFRP bars embedded in HPC.   Conduct pullout tests on GFRP bars using different exposure to elements such as freeze  thaw cycles of concrete and other environmental effects.  Â· A  standardized  pullout  test  apparatus  needs  to  be  established  for  future  experimental  research.
