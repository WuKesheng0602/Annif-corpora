"Critical  geography"  is  both  an  approach  to  scholarship  and  a  practice  of  scholarship.  The  term  "critical"  refers  to  a tradition  of  critical  theory. An  often  cited  representative  of  this  tradition  is  the  socalled  Frankfurt  School.  This  "school"  consisted of a network of researchers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research in  Frankfurt, Germany, which operated from 1923 to 1933, moved to New York during  the  Nazi  regime,  but  reopened  in  Frankfurt  in  1950.  Although  the  label  "Frankfurt  School"  is  problematic  and  inexact  (Behrens,  2002),  it  does  permit  associating  some  basic  ideas  with  the  notion  of  "critical".  According  to  Herbert  Marcuse  (1964:  x),  a  prominent  member  of  this  school:  "To  investigate  the  roots  of  [social]  developments  and examine their historical alternatives is part of the aim of a critical theory, a theory  which  analyzes  society  in  the  light  of  its  used  and  unused  or  abused  capacities  for  improving the human condition."    Achieving this aim, however, is complicated by the inability of researchers to  assume  objective  viewpoints  and  completely  dissociate  themselves  from  the  social  world  and  the  technologies  they  use.  In  fact,  scholars  and  scientists  as  well  as  the  institutions  in  which  they  operate  are  firmly  embedded  in  the  social  and  political  world.  If  scholarship  is  uncritical  towards  its  social  embeddedness,  it  is  prone  to  reproduce existing social order and inadvertently promote political, social and cultural  interests.  Critical  scholarship  therefore  does  not  deny  these  interests  but  rather  incorporates  them  into  its  approach.  Critical  scholarship  addresses  the  inevitable  dilemma of being a social and political activity by focusing on the tension between the  existing social and material world and the possibility for changing this world. With this  focus, critical scholarship realizes its role in society not to blindly reproduce existing  social order, but to create the conditions in which progressive change can occur. This

focus  also  means  that  the  separation  between  scholarship  and  practice  cannot  be  maintained. Rather, critical scholarship embraces the connection to critical practice.   In  the  discipline  of  Geography,  critical  scholarship  has  a  long  tradition.  This  tradition,  however,  has  varied  considerably  based  on  the  places  and  language communities  in  which  geographical  knowledge  is  produced  and  geographical  education  occurs.  The  still  largely  `white',  Eurocentric  viewpoints  that  prevail  in  `Anglophone' academic geography, as Laura Pulido points out in Chapter 7, reflects its  institutional  provenance  in  and  spread  from  central  and  western  Europe.  The  publications included in this Collection necessarily suffer from this narrow perspective  and  from  the  continuing  emphasis  in  `Anglophone'  academia  on  constructing  and  drawing  from  narrow  historical  and  intellectual  lineages  and  selective  evidence  (see  Diop,  1974).  Anglophone  histories  of  critical  geography  still  largely  ignore  the  contributions  of  African,  Asian  and  Latin  American  knowledge  systems  and  the  geographical  knowledges  developed  in  other  cultures.  An  example  is  Chapter  9  by  Elisée Reclus, included in this collection. This is a mid19th Century work, originally  in  French,  which  influenced  `Anglophone'  geographers  associated  with  the  socalled  "New  Left"  and  "radical  geography"  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  (Peet,  1977).  The  New  Left and radical geography had the great merit of rediscovering and reworking critical  approaches  from  both  within  and  outside  geography.  However,  the  main  sources  of  theoretical inspiration came from `white', male, heterosexual European perspectives2.  We  do  not  suggest  that  a  critical  outlook  is  impossible  through  a  single  or  limited  cultural  framework  (Marxist  work,  for  example,  has  had  much  applicability  beyond  white  males  in  Europe  and  North  America).  Recently,  however,  the  perspective  has  been  broadened  with  the  development  of  feminist,  sexuality,  and  postcolonial  approaches.  These  recent  approaches,  along  with  earlier  radical  approaches,  have  contributed to the emergence of the term "critical geographies" (Gibbons, 2001 Peet,  1998).  Despite  the  long  tradition  of  critical  thinking  in  Geography,  the  label  of  "critical geography" is a rather recent phenomenon. It gained popularity, for example,  in  Scandinavia  in  the  early  1980s  with  the  establishment  of  an  annual  meeting  for  critical  geography.  In  the  United  States,  an  annual  miniconference  on  critical  geography was initiated in 1994. In the United Kingdom, some geographers organized  under  the  label  critical  geography  in  the  mid1990s,  opposing  the  sponsorship  of  the  Royal  Geographical  Society  by  Shell  Oil,  a  corporation  associated  with  a  brutal  military  regime in  Nigeria (Berg, 2002  Blomley, 2008  Watts, 2001). In an effort to  foster  international  linkages,  critical  geographers  have  been  congregating  for  the  bi annual International Conference on Critical Geography since 1997 and met in Canada,  South Korea, Hungary, Mexico and India (see Chapter 6).                                                   
In addition, there is still an uncritical tendency to reproduce Eurocentric knowledge genealogies, often starting in Greece some 2000 years ago (e.g., Gibbons, 2001) or in Britain about 500 years ago (e.g., Johnston, 2003).

A particular issue, with which critical geographers have been concerned, is the  link  between  geographical  scholarship  and  activism.  While  some  critical  geographic  research  has  sought  to  support  activist  struggles  "on  the  street",  other  research  has  chosen  activism  as  a  research  topic.  In  addition,  critical  geographic  scholarship  has  been concerned with finding ways in which the university and the very nature in which  scholarship  is  practiced  can  be  transformed  (BanerjeeGuha,  2002  Blomley,  2008  Castree, 2000 Fuller and Kitchin, 2004 Moss et al., 2002, 3 Peet, 1998).   Today, critical geographies embrace wideranging topics, themes and theories.  Yet,  one  can  and  should  distinguish  between  critical  scholarship  and  "uncritical"  scholarship, which may entail critical thinking but  otherwise lacks the recognition of  subjectivity,  selfreflexivity  and  the  awareness  of  social  and  political  embeddedness  (Blomley, 2006). The texts selected in this book belong to this wider range of critical  scholarship in the tradition of critical theory that exists within academic geography.   However,  the  label  of  critical  scholarship  is  also  contested  (Katz,  1998).  For  example, one author, whose work is included in this book, explicitly rejected the label  critical  geographer  and  preferred  to  be  called  a  socialist  geographer.  Critical  scholarship, which follows critical approaches and practice, in fact, reaches far beyond  the community that identifies itself as "critical geographers". At the risk of excluding  critical  audiences  that  do  not  embrace  the  label  "critical  geographies"  and  including  authors  who  do  not  wish  to  carry  this  label,  we  used  the  term  as  the  title  in  this  Collection  because,  in  our  eyes,  it  represents  inclusiveness  and  reflects  the  nature  of  the  work  published  in  the  book.  In  addition,  we  chose  the  title  for  strategic  reasons,  seeking  to  claim  the  notion  of  "critical  geographies"  for  an  openaccess  publication  intended to be "owned" by the geographic community before it is  appropriated by the  corporate  publishing  industry.  Even  in  selecting  a  title  for  this  book,  we  are  confronting  the  problem  that  critical  scholarship  and  practice  are  inseparably  intertwined. There is no way around it.   In  geographical  education,  the  link  between  scholarship  and  practice  is  particularly important. Perhaps the ideas of critical theory translate most directly into  practice in the context of education. The core of critical scholarship relates to the ideas  developed  by  enlightenment  thinkers  in  the  18th  and  19th  Centuries  (Behrens  2002).  The German philosopher Immanuel Kant, for example, showed that the categories and  concepts, which make up the human world, are formed within the human subject itself.  To be  "critical", in this context, means  to  explore the origin and the limits of reason  (Werlen,  1999,  198).  Now,  consider  Kant's  famous  quote  from  1783  (2008/1783,  emphasis in the original):   Enlightenment  is  a  person's  release  from  his  selfimposed  tutelage.  Tutelage  is  a  person's  inability  to  use  of  one's  own  reason  without  guidance  from  someone  else.  Selfimposed  is  this  tutelage  when  its  origin  does  not  lie  in  the  lack  of  reason  but  in  the  lack  of  resolve  and  courage to use one's reason without guidance from someone else.

aude!  "Have  courage  to  use  your  own  reason!"  ­  that  is  the  motto  of  enlightenment.3  It  is  an  important  objective  of  critical  education  to  enable  students  to  use  their  own  reason and not uncritically internalize dogma, reproduce existing norms or regurgitate  conventional  knowledge.  Independent  thinking  and  reasoning,  however,  has  to  be  exercised with caution and discretion, because it harbours the potential to loop back to  dogma  and  convention,  and  lead  to  destruction  and  violence,  as  illustrated  in  the  catastrophes  of  Nazism  and  Stalinism  in  the  20th  Century  (Horkheimer  and  Adorno,  2002/1944).    Another important figure in critical scholarship is Karl Marx, who recognized  the  role  of  education  and  the  educator.  In  1845,  Marx  (1969/1845)  scribbled  eleven  theses in response to a book by Ludwig Feuerbach, whom he critiqued for neglecting  the influence of human practice and activity on shaping the human world (first thesis).  Before arriving at the famous eleventh thesis "The philosophers have only  interpreted  the world in various ways the point is to change it," Marx wrote in the third thesis:   The  materialist  doctrine  [followed  by  Feuerbach]  concerning  the  changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are  changed by people and that it is essential to educate the educator him or  herself. This doctrine must, therefore, divide society into two parts, one  of which is superior to society.   The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity  or  selfchanging  can  be  conceived  and  rationally  understood  only  as  revolutionary practice.  Scholarship and education are activities that influence the course of history and shape  the world. Rather than conveying objective truths about the world from a hypothetical  and nonexisting vantage point located outside of the world, scholarship and education  always  occur  in  a  particular  geographical  context  and  point  in  history.  They  are  practical and "revolutionary" activities because they shape the manner in which people  understand the world and how people act on the basis of this understanding (see also  David Harvey, Chapter 11).    The  importance  of  pedagogy  was  not  lost  on  geographer  and  anarchist  Peter  Kropotkin. In Chapter 2, which he wrote in 1885, he makes several proposals to teach  geography in a manner that cultivates a sense of commonality of all people as human  beings,  belonging  to  the  same  species.  As  part  of  what  would  now  be  called  pedagogical activism, Kropotkin insisted that egalitarianism should be practiced in the                                                   
Different translations exist of this text, which was originally published in German. We translated  Kant's  original  text  (and  Marx'  text  below)  in  a  manner  that  best  reflects,  in  our  eyes,  its  meaning in the context of this Introduction.

classroom and that teaching should lead to the development of selfteaching. It was not  until the past few decades, however, that such classroom strategies have gained wide ranging attention in the educational systems of North America and Europe.  As Kropotkin understood, pedagogical practices are directly connected to one's  understanding  and  practice  of  geography  (Kearns,  2004).  But  only  in  the  last  three  decades have Englishspeaking geographers begun critiquing the objectivity and truth  claims  assumed  in  mainstream  geography.  They  have  begun  recognizing  the  subjective,  persuasive  and  "poetic"  nature  of  geographical  inquiry  (e.g.  Barnes  and  Gregory,  1998).  For  example,  geographers  who  have  drawn  on  the  French  historian  Michel Foucault have made the relationship between knowledge and power a central  theme  of  their  scholarly  activities.  These  geographers  acknowledge  that  scientific  knowledge,  language  and  our  understanding  of  the  everyday  world  are  inseparably  intertwined.  Contemporary  critical  geographers  generally  realize  that  their  work  as  scientists,  their  roles  as  educators  and  their  participation  in  public  life  are  deeply  political.  This  realization,  however,  raises  questions  of  what  to  do  and  how  to  use  one's abilities (and "reason" as Kant pointed out) to change the world.   The following chapters offer a wide range of answers to these questions. They  all  engage  in  some  way  with  the  idea  that  critical  scholarship,  if  unhappy  with  the  circumstances it uncovers, must help create the conditions for progressive change. The  chapters  of  Part  I  of  this  Collection  are  summarized  under  the  rubric  "critical  reflections."  These  chapters  look  inward,  focusing  on  the  practices  of  academic  geographers themselves. What might look to outsiders as exercises in navelgazing, are  to  critical  geographers  valuable  assessments  of  their  own  practices  and  important  discussion  on  how  to  rectify  undesirable  circumstances.  The  chapters  of  Part  II  fall  under the label "space and society." These chapters examine geographical perspectives  of society, aiming to facilitate social change. Part III features chapters that engage with  our relations with the rest of nature, or the environment. A common theme throughout  many of these chapters is  not to take received ideas about nature or the environment  for  granted.  Rather,  these  ideas  are  ideological  reflections  of  the  societies  in  which  they  occur,  often  intertwined  with  practices  of  social  distinction  and  subordination.  Another  theme  consists in  understanding  environmental  problems  as  deeply  social  in  character, intimately intertwined with issues of social justice. Finally, the fourth set of  chapters  represents  work  on  cartography  (i.e.,  mapmaking)  and  Geographic  Information  Systems  that  shows  the  impossibility  of  neutrality  and  objectivity  in  representing the Earth's surface.   The  four  Parts  of  the  book  cover  a  vast  thematic  and  theoretical  terrain  of  geographical knowledge and reflection. Rather than offering a focused overview of a  particular body of critical work, this book involves a diverse set of geographical topics,  perspectives or approaches. This diversity should illustrate the wide range of problems  to  which  geographers  are  applying  critical  scholarship  and  inspire  readers  to  address  geographical problems in fresh and creative ways. It represents a sort of "hypertext",  showing multiple ways of understanding and interpreting similar issues and concerns.

Introduction: Critical Scholarship, Practice and Education 

In Roland Barthes's term, hypertext produces "writerly" texts that do not  dominate the reader and insist on particular readings, but instead engage  the reader as an "author" and insist upon the openness and intertextuality  of  the  text  -  that  is,  its  openness  to  other  texts  and  readings  (Pickles,  Chapter 33, 6).   We  hope  to  have  reinforced,  through  this  collection,  this  openness  to  a  variety  of  critical  approaches,  as  well  as  the  necessary  dialogue  among  these  perspectives  that  promotes the further development of "critical" political ideas.
