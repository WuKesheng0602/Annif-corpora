Abstract  
   This  thesis  investigates  the  privacy  risks  that  m-learning  app  users  face  by  identifying   the  personal  information  that  m-learning  apps  collect  from  their  users,  and  the  privacy   policies  of  these  apps.  It  reveals  that  most  of  the  m-learning  applications  have  similar   privacy  policies,  which  seem  to  protect  the  interests  of  the  providers  rather  than  the   users.  The  Privacy  by  Design  framework  is  reviewed  to  determine  whether  it  can  help   the  developers  address  user  privacy  concerns.  A  survey  is  conducted  to  explore  user   concerns  about  m-learning  apps'  privacy  practices.  The  results  from  the  sample  of  260   participants  suggest  that  users  are  less  concerned  with  the  collection  of  personal   information  that  is  non-identifiable.    The  survey  also  revealed  that  the  users  are  more   concerned  when  an  app  shares  their  personal  information  with  third  parties  for   commercial  purposes  than  when  it  is  shared  with  the  government.

Chapter  1  ­  Introduction  and  Research  Overview  
   In  our  age  of  rapid  technological  development,  personal  data  generated  by  user   behaviour  has  gained  a  new  meaning  and  a  new  value.  This  personal  information  has   become  an  economic  asset  for  many  businesses  and  organizations.  (Cavoukian  &  Reed,   2013.)  Unfortunately,  the  increase  in  the  value  of  personal  information  may  lead  to   larger  privacy  risks  and  greater  challenges  for  personal  data  protection.        This  thesis  is  focused  on  the  user-related  privacy  concerns  in  mobile  learning  or  m- learning.  According  to  Ugray  (2009),  there  are  three  m-learning  user  groups  that  can  be   affected  by  the  m-learning  security  issues  and  threats:  the  managers,  the  instructors,   and  the  learners.  The  instructors  and  the  managers  are  the  m-learning  developers,   implementers,  and  content  providers.  For  the  purposes  of  this  study  they  are  not   considered  to  be  end-users  as  they  do  not  have  to  register  or  subscribe  to  the  learning   material,  or  enrol  into  classes.  They  are  faced  with  fewer  privacy  issues,  because  they   don't  have  to  provide  as  much  personal  information  as  learners  who  are  using  m- learning  applications.  This  research  is  mainly  focused  on  the  learners,  because   ultimately  they  are  the  end-users;  and  as  such,  they  bear  the  greatest  privacy  risk.      The  thesis  explores  privacy  challenges  in  the  app-based  mobile  learning  environment.   Different  types  of  the  m-learning  applications  and  their  privacy  policies  were  reviewed   for  this  study  to  find  out  what  information  is  collected  from  the  users  and  how  this   information  is  used.    This  research  also  explores  how  the  Privacy  by  Design  framework   can  be  applied  to  address  privacy  concerns  in  the  m-learning  apps  and  to  provide  

   1  

         guidelines  on  embedding  privacy  in  the  development  process  of  m-learning  solutions.   Quantitative  data  were  collected  and  analysed  for  this  study  in  order  to  examine  the   importance  of  privacy  for  the  m-learning  app  users  and  to  investigate  whether  privacy   concerns  have  any  impact  on  their  usage  patterns.       

1.1.  Research  Objectives  and  Research  Questions  
   Whether  privacy  has  to  be  sacrificed  for  the  sake  of  the  innovation  and/or  business   development  is  the  subject  of  debate.  There  is  a  belief  that  privacy  cannot  exist  in  our   modern  digital  world.  However,  as  pointed  out  by  Cavoukian  (2012),  this  is  a   misleading  and  flawed  "zero-sum  model"  that  has  to  be  shifted  towards  a  "positive-sum   paradigm"  that  should  be  inclusive  and  allow  for  the  simultaneous  growth  of  privacy   and  other  functionalities.  Following  this  idea,  I  adopt  a  viewpoint  that  privacy  should  be   embedded  in  the  designs  of  mobile  learning  solutions,  because  it  is  the  responsible   thing  for  the  developers  to  do  and  is  beneficial  for  them  and  their  users.      The  primary  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  identify  the  privacy  concerns  in  m-learning   applications,  to  investigate  whether  users  are  concerned  with  the  privacy  risks  at  all,   and  to  determine  if  those  concerns  somehow  affect  their  use  of  the  m-learning   applications.  The  secondary  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  explore  how  and  if  Privacy  by   Design  (PbD)  can  address  user  privacy  concerns  and  help  developers  of  m-learning   applications  create  more  privacy-conscious  solutions  while  being  more  transparent   with  their  users.  Privacy  by  Design  is  a  framework  developed  in  the  1990s  by  the   former  Information  and  Privacy  Commissioner  of  Ontario,  Ann  Cavoukian.  The  main   idea  behind  this  approach  is  that  privacy  should  be  embedded  in  the  design  principles,      2  

         the  core  processes,  and  the  daily  operations  of  any  organization.  According  to  PbD,  user   privacy  should  be  a  primary  design  consideration  so  that  organizations  can  be  proactive   rather  than  reactive  when  it  comes  to  the  privacy  threats.        For  the  purposes  of  this  thesis,  PbD  is  not  used  as  a  theory  to  guide  the  research   process;  though  I  do  attempt  to  apply  the  principles  of  PbD  to  demonstrate  their   potential  in  m-learning.  The  PbD  approach  is  built  upon  7  principles  that  allow   organizations  to  embed  privacy  concerns  in  the  architecture  of  their  systems  and   processes.  Together  those  principles  (see  Chapter  2)  define  a  number  of  the   responsibilities  and  requirements  that  could  be  considered  a  strategy  or  a  guideline  for   the  successful  implementation  of  the  best  privacy  practices  in  business  and  product   development.      The  research  is  guided  by  the  following  research  question:   · What  are  the  user  privacy  concerns  regarding  m-learning  applications  and  what   effect  these  concerns  have,  if  any,  on  the  use  of  m-learning  applications?        The  following  sub-questions  are  explored  to  support  the  main  research  question:   · How  do  m-learning  applications  communicate  privacy  information  to  the  users?   Do  they  have  privacy  policies?  And  how  transparent  are  they  about  their  use  of   personal  information?   · How  user  privacy  concerns  can  be  addressed  to  embed  best  privacy  practices  in   the  app-based  m-learning  environment?

How  concerned  are  users  (experienced,  novice  and/or  potential)  of  the  m- learning  apps  about  user  information  collection?  Does  it  matter  to  the  users  what   type  of  personal  information  is  collected  from  them?

Does  it  matter  to  the  users  what  kind  of  user  information  their  m-learning  apps   share  with  third  parties,  for  what  purposes,  or  with  which  parties?

Can  Privacy  by  Design  approach  help  developers  create  m-learning  applications   that  protect  user  privacy?  If  so,  how?  

   The  review  of  Privacy  by  Design  framework  helped  direct  this  research  and  focus  more   on  particular  issues  of  communicating  privacy  information  to  the  users  of  m-learning   apps.  Privacy  by  Design  framework  helped  to  guide  the  review  of  the  privacy  policies  of   the  mobile  learning  applications.  The  review  of  the  privacy  policies  was  necessary  to   design  a  comprehensive  survey  that  would  address  the  main  research  question.  Privacy   by  Design  framework  also  helped  to  focus  my  attention  to  the  following  issues  while   reviewing  m-learning  applications:   · · · Are  users  informed  about  what  data  is  collected  from  them  and  how  it  is  used?   Can  users  of  m-learning  apps  opt-out  from  sharing  their  privacy  information?   Who  can  access  user  information,  is  it  shared  with  third  parties  and  for  what   purposes?

1.2.  Mobile  Learning  Defined  
   According  to  Verma  et  al.  (2012),  m-learning  is  a  perfect  ecosystem  for  learning  to   occur,  because  learning  as  an  activity  is  dynamic  and  mobile  with  regards  to  space,  time,   and  topic  areas:  "learning  occurs  at  different  places  (e.g.,  learning  institutes,  workplaces,   homes,  and  even  places  of  leisure),  at  different  times  (e.g.,  working  days,  weekends,  or   holidays),  and  between  different  topic  areas  of  life  (e.g.  education,  work,  self- improvement,  or  leisure)".  Verma  et  al.  (2012)  generalized  that  there  are  three  types  of   the  m-learning  systems:  push-based,  application-based,  and  browser-based.  This   research  is  focused  on  the  application-based  m-learning  (i.e.,  apps  that  have  to  be   downloaded  and  installed  on  mobile  devices,  and  not  web  browser-based  tools).  Push- based  tools  differ  from  the  others  in  that  information  delivery  is  initiated  by  the   provider  of  the  m-learning  tool  and  not  by  the  user,  i.e.  they  don't  provide  on-demand   service.  Mobile  learning  applications  (app-based  tools)  require  more  personal   involvement  and  control  from  users  than  push-based  solutions,  which  is  why  the  user   privacy  concerns  are  potentially  higher  in  app-based  solutions.      Li  Shiliang  and  Sun  Hongtao  (2013)  define  m-learning  as  "any  learning  or  training  (i.e.   knowledge  construction,  skill  development  training,  and  performance  support)  which   learners  engage  in  across  various  locations  and  contexts  at  the  time  of  their  choosing".   Dye  et  al.  (2003,  as  cited  in  Chong  et  al,  2011)  expand  this  definition  by  stating  that  m- learning  is  any  learning  or  training  that  occurs  on  a  device  that  can  provide  content  and   wireless  communication  between  a  course  instructor  and  a  learner,  meaning  that  m- learning  requires  interactivity.  In  this  thesis,  I  adopt  the  aforementioned  views,  adding  

   5  

         that  m-learning  has  to  be  performed  using  a  handheld  mobile  device  such  as  a  tablet,  a   personal  digital  assistant  (PDA),  a  smartphone,  or  a  mobile  phone.        Even  though  different  researchers  propose  different  definitions  for  the  mobile  learning,   all  of  those  definitions  can  be  roughly  classified  into  two  categories:     1)  a  techno-centric  perspective  on  m-learning,  through  which  the  m-learning  is   defined  by  the  technology:  m-learning  is  any  learning  or  training  that  is  delivered   and  received  by  the  means  of  the  mobile  devices  such  as  phones,  PDAs,  digital   audio  players,  and  even  digital  cameras,  voice  recorders,  pen  scanners,  etc.;   2)  a  learner-centred  perspective,  when  m-learning  is  defined  as  "any  sort  of   learning  that  happens  when  the  learner  is  not  at  a  fixed,  predetermined  location,   or  [as]  learning  opportunities  offered  by  mobile  technologies"  (Keskin  &  Metcalf,   2011).   To  properly  understand  the  uniqueness  of  the  mobile  learning  ecosystem  and  its   challenges,  we  should  consider  both  the  technological  and  the  learner  (user)  centred   perspectives  of  m-learning,  which  is  why  this  research  takes  into  account  the  specifics   on  m-learning  delivery  via  applications  on  mobile  devices,  as  well  as  the  views  and   concerns  of  the  current  and  potential  users  of  such  apps.      There  are  many  mobile  learning  applications  available  and  many  are  in  development.   Hao  and  Dennen  (in  Miller  &  Doering,  2014)  categorise  the  variety  of  m-learning   applications  according  to  their  paradigms  and  functions.  They  identify  four  types:   1) M-learning  app  as  a  "Tutor":  the  main  function  is  direct  instruction  and   assessment  (e.g.,  Flash  cards,  quiz  games  apps);  

   6  

         2) M-learning  app  as  an  "Information  source":  the  main  function  is  to  present   information  (e.g.,  eBooks,  animations);   3) "Simulator":  an  m-learning  app  that  presents  an  environment  (e.g.,  role-play   games  or  virtual  worlds);   4) "Collaboration  enabler":  an  app  that  connects  people  and  helps  them  work   together  (e.g.,  discussion  forums,  Web  2.0).      Considering  the  definition  of  m-learning  adopted  in  this  thesis,  the  applications  that   provide  learning  content  but  do  not  require  users  to  interact  with  a  course  instructor   and/or  between  each  other  are  not  considered  mobile  learning  applications.  The   methodology  part  of  this  thesis  (Chapter  3)  discusses  in  more  detail  what  type  of  m- learning  apps  were  included  in  this  research  and  why.  

   1.3.  Motivation  for  the  Research  
   Mobile  learning  (m-learning,  also  sometimes  spelled  mLearning)  has  been  around  for   about  two  decades.  It  used  to  be  considered  a  part  of  e-learning  or  a  transition  from  it,   and  some  researchers  still  share  this  view  (Kadirire,  2009;  Park  et  al.,  2012;  Ayoma  and   Oboka,  2013).  However,  a  growing  number  of  researchers  (Haag,  2011;  Cheon  et  al.,   2012;  Kambourakis,  2013;  Garg,  2013)  agree  that  m-learning  is  a  completely  separate   practice  from  e-learning,  with  its  own  rules  and  philosophy.  According  to  Kambourakis   (2013),  compared  to  e-learning,  m-learning  "imposes  an  entirely  different  path  to  be   followed  towards  information  presentation,  instructional  design,  graphic  and  user   experience  design".  Mobile  devices  are  becoming  more  ubiquitous  than  personal   computers  due  to  their  affordability  and  portability.  Because  of  that,  users  in  many      7  

         countries  bypass  e-learning  technologies  in  favour  of  adopting  m-learning.  (Towards   Maturity,  2013.)  In  many  developed  countries,  including  Canada,  being  mobile  and   digital  is  more  of  a  necessity  rather  than  a  luxury  in  recent  years.  People  increasingly   use  mobile  devices  in  their  everyday  lives  for  socialising  and  communication,  shopping,   business,  entertainment,  planning  out  their  tasks  and  schedules,  accessing  news,  and   more  (Nielsen,  2014).  As  mobile  devices  become  more  affordable  and  accessible,  mobile   learning  technologies  become  more  widespread  and  relevant.  The  latest  advances  in  the   mobile  devices  not  only  help  increase  the  popularity  of  the  mobile  learning,  but  also   create  new  possibilities  for  the  development  of  the  mobile  learning  applications.  Due  to   these  technological  developments,  the  "paradigms  of  teaching  and  learning  are  being   transformed  from  a  traditional,  situated,  and  lecture-based  format  to  an  on-demand,   online  environment,  where  learning  is  collaborative  and  socially  constructed"   (Schroeder,  2013).      The  researchers  and  scholars  who  explored  m-learning  in  the  early  1990s  expected  a   rapid  revolution  in  education  with  the  emergence  of  m-learning  technologies.  Despite   these  high  expectations,  no  dramatic  change  in  the  education  or  workplace  training  was   achieved  at  that  time,  and  we  still  have  a  long  way  to  go  until  we  embrace  the  full   potential  of  the  mobile  devices  and  the  mobile  learning  technologies  in  schools  and  in   the  workplace  (Cheon  et  al.,  2012).  This  raises  questions  about  the  possible  challenges   and  obstacles  for  m-learning  development  and  motivated  me  to  explore  user-related   concerns  in  the  m-learning  ecosystem.    

  
The  literature  review  (see  Chapter  2)  revealed  that  there  is  a  lack  of  research  about  the   privacy  threats  in  the  m-learning  environment.  Current  research  about  m-learning      8  

         revolves  mostly  around  the  economic  challenges  of  m-learning  delivery  and  acceptance   (e.g.,  no  access  to  mobile  devices)  and  less  so  around  the  socio-technological  problems   within  the  m-learning  ecosystem.  Even  though  there  is  a  growing  body  of  research  on   the  issues  of  the  m-learning  design  (Uden,  2007;  Maske  et  al.,  2011),  adoption  (Liu  et  al.,   2010;  Crescente  &  Lee,  2010;  Gong  &  Wallace,  2012),  and  acceptance  (Liaw  et  al.,  2010;   Maske  et  al.,  2011;  Cheon  et  al.,  2012;  Mohammad  &  Job,  2013),  there  is  a  lack  of  studies   on  the  issues  of  privacy  in  m-learning  (Kambourakis,  2013;  Ugray,  2009).  The  research   that  has  been  done  in  the  area  so  far  is  mainly  focused  on  the  challenges  from  the   developers'  and  designers'  perspective,  and  on  the  privacy  concerns  of  the  educators   who  provide  the  content  for  the  m-learning  solutions.  Unfortunately,  little  to  no   attention  has  been  given  to  the  actual  users  of  the  m-learning  tools  (i.e.,  the  learners)   with  regard  to  what  privacy  threats  they  may  encounter  using  m-learning  applications,   and  how  much  they  care  about  their  privacy  in  their  use  of  m-learning  apps.      It  is  important  to  identify  the  m-learning  privacy  challenges  in  order  to  design  the   solutions  that  deal  with  those  challenges  effectively.  Starting  from  the  early  stages  of  the   product  development,  the  designers  have  to  consider  that  the  m-learning  applications   they  create  can  have  potential  privacy  risks  for  the  users  of  those  applications.       

1.4.  Structure  of  This  Thesis  
   The  research  process  for  this  thesis  included  a  literature  review  on  the  privacy  concerns   in  the  m-learning  ecosystem,  a  review  of  the  m-learning  apps,  and  a  survey  of  user   privacy  concerns  in  the  use  of  m-learning  applications.         9  

         Chapter  2  covers  the  literature  and  theory  review.  In  this  chapter,  I  present  a  relevant   body  of  literature  and  current  research  in  the  field  of  m-learning  in  general,  and  the   review  of  the  literature  on  privacy  issues  in  m-learning  in  particular.  This  chapter   discusses  the  most  common  concerns  in  the  mobile  learning  industry  and  identifies  the   gap  in  the  research  on  m-learning  privacy  challenges.  It  starts  from  a  general  overview   of  the  field  of  study  and  then  proceeds  to  a  more  narrow  inquiry  into  the  specific   privacy  concerns  in  m-learning.  In  addition,  this  chapter  focuses  on  the  Privacy  by   Design  approach  and  explores  if  it  can  be  applied  (and  how)  in  the  mobile  learning  apps   research  and  development.      The  literature  review  helped  in  defining  the  research  problem  and  set  the  ground  for   the  next  stages  in  the  research  process.  Apart  from  the  literature  review  and  the   theoretical  considerations,  the  research  involved  two  major  steps:  the  review  of  the   privacy  policies  of  m-learning  applications,  and  the  survey  study.        Chapter  3  outlines  the  research  design  and  discusses  the  methods  used  for  this  thesis   project.  Both  secondary  and  primary  data  were  collected  for  the  purposes  of  this  study.   The  secondary  data  included  reviews  of  the  academic  publications,  white  papers,  media   articles  and  reports,  and  other  publicly  available  materials.  The  Privacy  Policies  and  the   Terms  of  Service  of  different  m-learning  apps  were  reviewed  for  this  research  in  order   to  identify  potential  user-related  privacy  risks  and  to  explore  what  needs  to  be   addressed  in  the  survey  research.  Chapter  3  discusses  different  types  of  m-learning   applications  and  the  context  of  this  study  to  explain  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria   for  the  mobile  learning  apps  for  the  review.  It  also  presents  the  methodology  for  the   survey  study  and  the  design  of  the  survey  instrument.

2.1.  M-Learning  Challenges  and  Main  Research  Areas  
   M-learning  has  been  viewed  either  as  a  part,  or  as  an  extension,  of  e-learning  since  the   1990s,  but  lately  more  researchers  consider  it  a  discipline  in  its  own  right  (Ugray,  2009;   Crescente  &  Lee,  2010).  According  to  Crompton  (2013),  m-learning  became  a   recognized  term  only  in  2005.  M-learning  has  the  potential  of  making  learning  more   widely  accessible,  because  it  decreases  the  limitation  of  the  learning  location  with  the   mobility  of  the  general  portable  devices  (Ayoma  &  Oboko,  2013).  It  is  a  growing   industry  in  many  regions  in  the  world,  especially  in  the  United  States  and  China  (Liu  et   al.,  2010).        There  are  many  issues  to  consider  in  the  m-learning  ecosystem.  M-learning  used  to  be   considered  a  disruptive  innovation  and  was  expected  to  substantially  change  the   learning  and  training  practices  and  become  ubiquitous  over  two  decades  ago.  This   revolution  occurred  neither  in  education  nor  in  business  environment.  For  mobile   learning  to  move  "from  project  status  to  the  mainstream",  Paliwal  and  Sharma  (2009)   suggested  the  following:   · · Convince  the  universities  to  accept  m-learning;     Produce  m-learning  development  kits  for  the  universities  and  colleges   worldwide;     · Produce  course  guides  and  develop  literature  on  m-learning;

However,  before  taking  the  aforementioned  steps,  there  is  still  a  need  to  understand  the   specific  problems  and  concerns  in  the  m-learning  environment.  Knowing  what   challenges  have  to  be  addressed  in  m-learning  can  potentially  boost  its  development   and  implementation,  and  also  improve  m-learning  adoption,  perceptions  and   acceptance  toward  it.  Common  m-learning  challenges  can  be  identified  from  reviewing   relevant  literature.        According  to  McConatha  and  Praul  (2007),  the  first  published  studies  focusing   specifically  on  m-learning  date  back  to  the  early  2000s.  Within  those  studies  the   question  of  the  mobile  learning  challenges  has  been  raised  repeatedly,  yet  there  is  some   controversy  about  it  among  the  researchers  and  educators  (McConatha  &  Praul,  2007).   Consequently,  there  are  different  perspectives  on  how  those  challenges  should  be   addressed  and  resolved.  Table  2-1  below  summarizes  various  problems,  challenges  and   concerns  in  the  m-learning  environment  identified  and  discussed  in  the  literature.      Table  2-1:  The  primary  foci  of  the  research  on  the  m-learning  challenges.   What  questions  were  raised;  what   problems  were  explored   Adoption  of  m- · Empirical  analysis  of  factors  affecting   learning   the  adoption  of  m-learning  in  Malaysia   based  on  the  extended  technology   acceptance  model  (TAM)  and  the   theory  of  planned  behaviour  (TPB).   · Literature  reviews  of  m-learning   adoption  processes  worldwide.   User  readiness  or   · Exploration  of  older  workers'   market   attitudes  toward  m-learning  in   Topic/concern   Notable  publications   Liu  et  al.,  2010;     Chong  et  al.,  2011;   Crescente  &  Lee,  2011;     Gong  &  Wallace,  2012.

            The  literature  review  conducted  for  this  thesis  revealed  that  the  problems  of  m-learning   adoption  and  acceptance  are  the  most  explored  subjects  in  research  on  m-learning.  The   most  commonly  used  theories  in  the  studies  on  those  issues  are  the  Theory  of  Planned   Behaviour  (TPB)  and  the  Technology  Acceptance  Model  (TAM).  In  addition,  the  Activity   Theory  developed  by  Engeström  is  becoming  increasingly  popular  in  m-learning   research.  For  a  detailed  review  of  theoretical  approaches  used  in  m-learning  research,   see  Keskin  &  Metcalf  (2011).  After  technology  adoption  and  acceptance,  the  most   popular  research  subject  in  m-learning  is  m-learning  design.  The  variety  of  mobile   devices  makes  it  difficult  to  create  common  m-learning  standards  and  to  design  m- learning  solutions  that  cater  to  different  platforms  (Educause,  2010);  both  of  which  can   explain  why  challenges  of  m-learning  design  is  a  popular  research  topic.      M-learning  providers  and  developers  face  pedagogical,  technical,  administrative,  and   even  legal  challenges  when  designing  their  m-learning  products  and  services.  It  is   important  to  recognise  that  those  challenges  also  include  security  and  privacy  concerns   (Kambourakis,  2013).  For  instance,  one  of  the  most  recent  books  on  mobile  learning,   "The  New  Landscape  of  Mobile  Learning",  edited  by  Charles  Miller  and  Aaron  Doering   (2014),  combined  a  number  of  articles  with  the  latest  research  on  the  design  challenges   in  the  app-based  m-learning,  yet  privacy  concerns  were  completely  overlooked  in  all  of   the  studies  selected  for  this  publication.  Generally  speaking,  the  research  gathered  in   this  book  was  mostly  conducted  from  the  designers'  perspective  or  the  teachers'  and   content  developers'  perspectives,  but  not  from  the  users'  perspective.  This  sort  of   ignorance  of  the  user-related  privacy  concerns  seems  to  be  a  common  problem  in  m- learning  research.  The  researchers  express  concerns  with  the  protection  of  the  course

         materials  from  the  course  developer's  perspective,  i.e.  copyright  issues  (Kambourakis,   2013),  but  there  is  no  discussion  about  protecting  the  users  and  the  information  they   provide  to  m-learning  applications.      There  is  a  need  to  identify  possible  insecurities  that  are  specific  to  the  m-learning   environment,  because  an  understanding  of  the  user  privacy  concerns  is  a  prerequisite   for  the  development  of  the  user-centered  design.  This  thesis  aims  to  begin  an  inquiry   into  user-related  privacy  concerns  in  app-based  m-learning  ecosystem.     

2.2.  Privacy  Considerations  in  M-Learning  
   2.2.1.  Mobile  Device-Related  Vulnerabilities   As  m-learning  gains  more  acceptance,  the  developers  face  more  challenges  in  the  m- learning  implementation  and  design.  Some  of  these  challenges  are  directly  related  to  the   reliance  on  the  mobile  and  wireless  technology  (Ugray,  2009).  It  may  be  harder  to   manage  security  concerns  in  application-based  mobile  learning  than  in  the  web-based   mobile  learning  because  the  applications  are  downloaded  directly  onto  the  users'   devices.  Mobile  and  wireless  devices  are  inherently  vulnerable  to  the  privacy  risks,   security  breaches  and  cyber  threats  because  of  the  broadcast  nature  of  wireless   communication  (Ugray,  2009;  Garg,  2013).  Hence,  the  developers  have  to  think  about   the  privacy  and  security  concerns  of  both  the  apps  and  the  devices  (Kam,  2012;  Garg,   2013).  Mobile  devices  used  for  system-to-system  data  transfers  or  to  enable  interaction   (e.g.,  in  m-learning  context)  may  trigger  privacy  risks  such  as  unwanted  data  collection   or  leakage,  user's  location  tracking,  improper  redirection  to  an  unknown  website,

         initiation  of  an  unknown  service,  receipt  of  unwanted  content,  and  also  identifying   users  when  they  want  to  stay  anonymous  (Cavoukian,  2011).      According  to  Kam  (2012),  the  devices  and  the  apps  follow  a  standard  lifecycle  of   technological  development,  in  which  a  security  is  not  a  concern  until  a  technology  is   adopted  and  becomes  a  part  of  consumers'  everyday  life.  Rapid  adoption  is  encouraged   to  get  this  lifecycle  going  and  to  boost  innovation  and  development.  Such  "backwards   approach"  to  security  may  be  justified  by  the  vendors'  uncertainty  about  the  adoption  of   the  new  technology,  but  it  creates  a  problem  defined  as  a  "lifecycle  of  insecurity"  (Kam,   2012):  developers  often  address  security  issues  at  the  point  when  a  device  or  an  app  is   already  adopted  and  is  already  popular  with  the  users.  This  order  of  things  doesn't   make  the  job  of  the  developers  easier.  Ignoring  security  aspects  to  release  an  app  or  a   device  as  soon  as  possible  doesn't  necessarily  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  business   development  as  well.  It  would  be  more  reasonable  to  "reverse  the  cycle"  and  embed   privacy  and  security  in  the  design  rather  than  coming  up  with  the  solutions  after  the   security  threats  become  a  major  problem.  (Kam,  2012.)        Users  cannot  rely  on  applications  and  wi-fi  hotspots  for  security  if  they  need  safe   Internet  connection  to  use  an  app;  and  mobile  devices  do  not  necessarily  have  built-in   protections  like  anti-virus  software,  firewalls,  or  VPN.  Users  can  download  applications   to  protect  their  data,  but  it  should  not  be  only  the  users'  responsibility  to  protect  the   data  on  their  devices  from  privacy  and  security  threats,  as  many  users  may  not  be   aware  of  all  the  risks  that  come  with  downloading  an  app.  There  is  also  a  concern  that   mobile  users  do  not  take  the  necessary  measures  to  protect  themselves  from  the   privacy  risks  and  the  possible  vulnerabilities.  According  to  Symantec's  Norton  Report  

  18  

         2013,  57  percent  of  adults  were  unaware  about  the  existence  of  the  security  solutions   that  can  protect  their  mobile  devices  in  2013;  yet,  in  2012  this  number  was  at  44   percent.  If  this  trend  is  correct,  it  can  be  explained  by  rapidly  growing  numbers  of  the   users  of  the  mobile  devices  (Symantec,  2014).  As  mobile  devices  become  more   ubiquitous  and  users  come  from  increasingly  diverse  backgrounds,  increasing  numbers   of  users  may  not  see  the  value  of  personal  information  protection  until  they  experience   a  breach  of  their  data  security.  Furthermore,  privacy  protection  cannot  be  left  to  the   users  alone  as  most  users  may  not  know  how  to  protect  their  data,  or  may  not  have  the   tools  or  resources  to  do  so.      Contrary  to  popular  belief,  password  protection  is  insufficient  to  secure  personally   identifiable  information  (PII)  on  a  mobile  device.  Access  to  PII  on  a  mobile  device  has  to   be  both  password-protected  and  encrypted  to  secure  the  device  from  the  breaches  of   PII  (Cavoukian,  2013b).  Fortunately,  iPhones  and  Android  phones  are  now  encrypted  by   default,  not  relying  on  user  skills  or  even  awareness  to  provide  this  security.  However,   Garg  (2013)  claims  that  the  data  encryption  and  the  login-protected  access  are  not   enough;  he  suggests  that  m-learning  app  users  need  to  implement  more  rigorous   security  measures  such  as  Mobile  Device  Management  (MDM)  and  Mobile  Application   Management  (MAM).        Apart  from  the  breaches  and  cyber  threats,  there  are  other  more  common  risks  that   users  might  not  be  aware  of.  For  instance,  mobile  applications  often  collect  highly   accurate  sensor  data  (such  as  location)  without  users'  knowledge,  without  a  clear   explanation  of  why  they  need  to  collect  these  data,  and  without  explicitly  declaring  who   has  access  to  this  information  after  it  is  collected.

            The  above-mentioned  data  protection  measures  may  seem  extreme  for  m-learning   apps'  users;  but  student  or  learner  information  may  be  very  sensitive.  M-learning   applications  collect  not  only  personal  information  such  as  birth  date,  personal  contact   information,  and  credit  card  information,  but  they  also  collect  and  store  their  users'   educational  history  (e.g.,  courses/classes  taken  or  enrolled  in),  grades,  test  scores,   learning  progress,  etc.  It  should  be  considered  that  sharing  this  information  with   commercial  organizations,  government,  or  any  unknown  third  parties  might  be   damaging  or  unpleasant  for  some  users.      2.2.2.  Mobile  Apps  Permissions   Most  apps  require  their  users  to  grant  various  permissions  to  enable  even  the  basic   features  of  the  apps.  An  application's  permission  means  an  access  to  the  information  on   a  user's  mobile  device  that  this  application  requires  in  order  to  operate  or  to  unlock   special  features  for  the  user.  Every  application  has  some  baseline  permissions  that  are   granted  automatically  when  the  app  is  installed  (e.g.,  access  to  the  Internet).  In  addition,   an  app  could  ask  for  many  extra  permissions  such  as  access  to  contacts,  access  to   calendar,  GPS/location  tracking,  access  to  a  camera  or  a  microphone,  etc.      More  than  1,200  mobile  apps  were  examined  in  the  Global  Privacy  Enforcement   Network  (GPEN)  Sweep  in  May  2014  (Cohen,  2014).  In  the  course  of  this  sweep,  26   privacy  enforcement  authorities  from  different  countries  reviewed  the  privacy  policies   of  1,211  mobile  applications  and  found  that  more  than  30%  of  those  apps  ask  users  to   grant  permissions  beyond  the  functionalities  of  the  apps  or  do  not  provide  an   explanation  why  they  need  an  access  to  some  of  the  user  personal  data  (Cohen,  2014).

         For  example,  it  is  understandable  that  Instagram  (a  photo-sharing  app)  requires  a   permission  to  access  a  camera  so  that  users  can  take  pictures  using  the  app;  and  it  asks   for  an  access  to  its  users'  photos  for  users  to  be  able  to  upload  their  pictures  to  their   Instagram  feeds.  As  another  example,  it  is  unclear  why  a  flashlight  application  would   ask  to  access  users'  location,  and  contacts.  The  sweep  revealed  that  most  of  the  apps   track  users  location,  but  in  many  cases  it  is  unclear  why.  (Cohen,  2014.)  According  to   Sweatt  et  al.  (2014),  sharing  user  location  "with  the  public  or  specific  third  parties   might  be  risking  robbery,  identity  theft,  etc."  (Sweatt  et  al.,  2014,  p.27).  Considering  how   sensitive  such  information  could  be,  it  is  important  to  find  out  how  applications  use  this   information  and  whether  they  share  it  with  any  third  parties.        Depending  on  the  app  or  on  the  device,  users  may  grant  all  app's  permissions  by  default.   For  instance,  due  to  Android's  design,  mobile  applications  "must  grant  all  access   regardless  of  the  permission  type  or  need"  (Liccardi  et  al.,  2014).  In  other  words,  an   Android  user  can  either  choose  to  allow  all  permissions  at  install  time  or  opt-out  from   using  some  apps  altogether.  Apple  users  manage  their  permissions  differently.  An  iOS   app's  permissions  system  does  not  grant  any  special  permissions  for  the  apps  when  a   user  installs  an  application,  allowing  for  only  basic  permissions.  When  an  iOS   application  needs  to  use  additional  permissions,  a  pop-up  window  occurs  asking  the   user  to  grant  the  access,  and  the  user  then  has  a  choice  of  refusing  to  provide  it.  An  iOS   user  can  also  manage  the  permissions  in  the  Settings  after  the  app  is  already  installed.   Android  users  used  to  have  a  similar  option  with  an  even  better  functionality  via  the   AppOps  built-in  application  permission  manager,  but  it  is  no  longer  available  for

         Android  4.4.2.  Some  advanced  users  can  root1  their  Android  devices  to  allow  them  to   individually  manage  permissions;  but  this  is  a  complicated  process  and  most  users   would  not  have  the  technical  skills,  nor  the  wish  to  void  their  device's  warranty.      It  is  worth  mentioning,  however,  that  not  everything  that  may  be  perceived  as  privacy   breach  or  developers  neglecting  privacy  is  intentional.  According  to  Fekete  (2012),   without  proper  monitoring  programs  installed,  the  developers  may  not  know  that  their   apps  handle  personal  information  exactly  as  it  is  described  in  their  apps'  privacy   policies.  Fekete  (2012)  also  suggests  that  some  apps  may  collect  personal  information   "simply  because  it  may  be  useful  in  the  future",  and  he  cautions  to  avoid  following  this   practice.        Generally,  users  can  opt-out  from  sharing  certain  data  with  the  mobile  apps  only  if  they   are  aware  of  the  permissions  and  the  privacy  policies  of  the  apps  they  use.  However,   many  applications  are  ambiguous  about  what  information  is  collected  on  their  users   and  for  what  purposes.  To  investigate  how  m-learning  applications  use  personal   information,  I  profiled  31  m-learning  apps.  The  results  of  this  examination  are   presented  in  the  Chapter  4.      2.2.3.  M-Learning  Apps-Related  Privacy  Issues,  Threats  and  Concerns   The  literature  review  suggests  that  there  are  many  issues  in  m-learning  directly  related   to  the  mobile  devices  and  the  insecurities  of  the  wireless  networks;  however,  there  is  a   lack  of  research  exploring  the  m-learning-specific  privacy  threats.  The  mobile  apps

         developers  and  designers  share  many  common  security  and  user  privacy  protection   challenges,  but  every  type  of  application  might  have  specific  concerns  related  to  its   functionalities.  Specific  challenges  for  the  developers  of  m-learning  apps  should  be   explored.      There  are  many  privacy  risks  to  consider  in  m-learning.  One  of  the  main  concerns   remains  the  fact  that  users  have  little  to  no  ability  to  manage  their  privacy  settings  in   mobile  applications.  As  was  mentioned  earlier  in  this  chapter,  users  may  share   personally  identifiable  information  with  the  apps,  including  but  not  limited  to  the   information  about  their  courses,  their  progress  and  grades,  their  academic  and   professional  or  even  personal  interests.  Information  about  what  course  a  user  wants  to   take  or  takes  for  personal  or  professional  development  may  be  sensitive,  a  user  may  not   want  to  share  this  information  with  third  parties.  Information  about  the  progress  of  the   m-learning  users  and  their  grades  may  be  another  piece  of  information  that  they  would   not  want  to  share  with  anyone.  Increasing  numbers  of  m-learning  applications  also   incorporate  connections  to  social  networking  sites  (Ugray,  2009),  meaning  that  those   applications  have  access  to  the  users'  profiles  on  social  networks  and  vice  versa.  This   creates  additional  privacy  challenges,  because  learning-related  information  may  be  too   sensitive  to  share  it  with  others  (Ugray,  2009).        In  recent  years,  many  m-learning  solutions  have  been  integrated  with  cloud  computing   due  to  the  limited  storage  and  computational  power  available  on  mobile  devices.  With   the  help  of  cloud  technologies  it  is  now  easier  for  educators  and  learners  to  share  large   files  via  m-learning  platforms  (Kambourakis,  2013).  However,  the  cloud  computing   paradigm  presents  new  security  challenges  for  the  educational  environment.  Verma  et

In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  issues,  Kambourakis  (2013)  suggests  that  there  are   problems  of  "content  filtering",  and  the  protection  of  copyright  and  intellectual  property   rights  (IPR).  He  describes  the  need  for  content  filtering  as  the  need  to  block  some   inappropriate  content  from  children  (Kambourakis,  2013).  In  the  case  of  app-based  m- learning,  providing  appropriate  content  for  learning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  course   instructors  and  content  developers,  with  app  developers  responsible  for  preventing  any   inappropriate  third  party  advertising.  As  for  the  copyright,  while  protection  of  the   learning  materials  in  m-learning  apps  may  be  a  valid  concern,  the  focus  on  this  topic   within  a  discussion  on  privacy  challenges  in  m-learning  provides  another  example  of   the  research  where  attention  is  given  to  addressing  the  problems  of  content  developers   and  system  designers  rather  than  to  the  exploration  of  the  learners'  personal  data   protection.  Admittedly,  Kambourakis  (2013)  makes  a  point  that  there  should  be  a  fair   trade-off  between  the  users  and  developers:  the  users  have  to  share  some  data  so  that   developers  can  provide  their  assistance,  enable  assessment  and  support  collaboration.   However,  it  should  also  be  said  that  often  users  have  to  provide  more  information  than   an  app  requires  to  function,  and  often  users  have  no  possibility  to  opt-out  from  sharing   this  information  with  the  app.

            To  sum  up,  the  literature  review  identified  the  following  gaps  that  this  thesis  aims  to   address:     · There  is  little  research  on  privacy  issues  in  m-learning,  and  in  this  research  only   developers'  and  providers'  privacy  challenges  are  considered.  No  attention  has   been  given  to  the  privacy  concerns  from  the  perspective  of  m-learning  users   (learners).   · The  privacy  concerns  that  have  been  mentioned  in  the  literature  on  m-learning   are  very  general  and  can  be  applied  to  anything  that  is  done  on  mobile  devices,   and  not  specific  to  m-learning  activities.     

2.3  Privacy  by  Design  Framework  
   2.3.1.  The  Roots  and  Fundamentals  of  PbD   Privacy  by  Design  (PbD)  is  a  framework  created  in  the  1990s  by  the  former  Information   and  Privacy  Commissioner  of  Ontario,  Canada,  Ann  Cavoukian.  PbD  advocates  for   embedding  best  privacy  practices  in  an  organization's  default  mode  of  operation  rather   than  trying  to  assure  user  privacy  only  by  complying  with  regulatory  frameworks  and   privacy  legislation.  This  approach  states  that  privacy  risks  should  be  addressed  when  a   technology  is  being  developed  and  not  when  it  has  been  already  adopted  (Cavoukian,   2012),  which  is  why  PbD  could  be  an  appropriate  approach  for  breaking  the  "lifecycle  of   insecurity"  in  the  modern  technologies.        PbD  is  composed  of  the  seven  principles  that  are  designed  to  serve  as  a  guide  for   embedding  best  privacy  practices  across  the  business  ecosystem.  Each  principle     26  

         encompasses  a  set  of  actions  that  are  needed  for  successful  systematic  execution  and   fulfillment  of  those  principles.  The  PbD  framework  was  developed  to  anticipate  and   prevent  privacy-invasive  events  rather  than  wait  for  privacy  risks  to  turn  into  breaches   (Cavoukian,  2013a);  thus  the  first  principle  of  PbD  is  called  "Proactive  not  Reactive;   Preventive  not  Remedial".  It  dictates  a  number  of  actions  that  focus  on  the  roles  played   by  organizational  senior  management  in  the  development  and  execution  of  an  effective   privacy  policy  (Cavoukian,  2012).      The  second  principle  of  PbD  is  "Privacy  as  the  Default  Setting".  It  was  set  to  protect   users'  privacy  even  when  they  don't  protect  themselves.  As  was  discussed  earlier  in  this   thesis,  users  are  not  always  aware  of  the  privacy  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  mobile   devices  or  m-learning  applications.  Moreover,  even  if  a  user  knows  about  the  threats,   they  may  not  know  how  to  address  them.  For  that  reason,  the  PbD  approach  encourages   the  developers  and  managers  to  ensure  that  personal  data  are  automatically  protected   by  IT  solutions  and  business  practices.  This  principle  dictates  that  ensuring  the  security   of  personal  data  should  not  be  the  responsibility  of  a  user  alone.  The  providers,   designers,  and  developers  should  be  responsible  for  creating  safe  and  secure  systems   that  would  have  user  privacy  protection  as  a  default  setting.      The  next  principle  ­  "Privacy  Embedded  into  Design"  ­  urges  organisations  to   incorporate  best  privacy  practices  in  the  core  of  their  business  practices,  IT  solutions,   and  system  development  lifecycles  instead  of  making  privacy  an  "add-on"  feature  after   the  systems  have  been  already  developed.  According  to  PbD,  user  privacy  should  be  an   essential  design  component  rather  than  a  secondary  feature  (Cavoukian,  2013a).

         PbD  advocates  the  philosophy  that  if  some  design  features  are  not  feasible  from  the   privacy  perspective,  than  the  developers  should  let  go  of  those  features  at  the  design   stage  or  find  a  technological  solution  that  would  allow  adding  the  desired  features   without  jeopardising  user  privacy.  It  is  unethical  of  the  designers  to  add  features  to   their  products  that  cannot  be  built  to  respect  user  privacy.      One  of  the  most  challenging  dimensions  of  the  PbD  is  its  fourth  principle,  called  "Full   Functionality  ­  Positive-Sum,  not  Zero-Sum"  (Cavoukian,  2012).  The  PbD  approach   doesn't  tolerate  zero-sum  solutions  that  require  making  trade-offs  to  the  disadvantage   of  the  user  privacy  protection.  This  principle  aims  to  provide  a  set  of  requirements  and   activities  for  organizations  to  accommodate  their  development  without  sacrificing   privacy,  emphasising  that  innovation  and  legitimate  business  interest  can  coexist  with   best  privacy  practices  and  solutions.        The  principle  "End-to-End  Security  ­  Full  Lifecycle  Protection"  states  that  the  PbD   approach  has  to  be  embedded  into  the  systems  from  the  beginning  and  then  extend  data   protection  from  the  period  when  first  elements  of  information  are  collected  throughout   the  full  lifecycle  of  that  data  involved  from  start  to  finish,  until  the  time  when  the   retained  data  is  "securely  destroyed  at  the  end  of  the  process,  in  a  timely  fashion"   (Cavoukian,  2013a).        Next,  the  sixth  principle  is  "Visibility  and  Transparency  ­  Keep  it  Open  ":  it  states  that   visibility  and  transparency  are  essential  for  the  strong  privacy  program.  An   organization's  approach  to  privacy  should  be  visible  and  clear  to  its  customers  to   generate  trust  in  an  organization  and  its  operations.  

  28  

            Finally,  the  last  principle  of  the  framework  is  "Respect  for  User  Privacy  ­  Keep  it  User- Centric":  the  PbD  approach  protects  the  interests  of  the  end-user  above  all,  and  the   compliance  with  the  PbD  requires  organizations  to  make  their  systems  user-friendly.   From  the  PbD  perspective,  user-centricity  means  "anticipating  users'  interests  and   capabilities,  making  it  easy  for  them  to  interact  with  a  given  system,  to  understand  the   essential  privacy-related  processes,  their  applicability  and  relevance  and  to  make   effective  use  of  available  options  to  express  [user]  privacy  preferences  and  customize   [user]  online  experience"  (Cavoukian  &  Weiss,  2012).  Furthermore,  creating  a  user- friendly  and  user-centric  design  means  taking  into  account  or  anticipating,  whenever   possible,  who  the  end-user  will  be,  and  developing  tools  and  solutions  with  that   particular  user  in  mind.  For  instance,  if  a  product  or  a  system  is  intended  for  children's   use,  it  might  be  appropriate  to  make  the  privacy  settings  more  restrictive  (Cavoukian  &   Weiss,  2012).      2.3.2.  PbD  Application  Areas  and  Global  Adoption   Over  the  last  almost  20  years,  PbD  gained  a  widespread  acceptance  within  the  public   and  private  sectors.  The  PbD  framework  has  been  endorsed  by  the  International   Association  of  Data  Protection  Authorities  and  Privacy  Commissioners,  the  European   Union,  the  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission,  and  many  individual  privacy  professionals   (Cavoukian,  2012).        In  2010  PbD  was  unanimously  approved  as  an  international  standard  by  the   International  Assembly  of  Privacy  and  Data  Protection  Authorities  at  their  annual   conference  in  October  2010  in  Jerusalem,  Israel  (Cavoukian  &  Jutla,  2014).  At  this  

  29  

         conference  PbD  has  been  declared  an  essential  component  of  fundamental  privacy   protection  in  the  Resolution,  which  was  co-sponsored  by  Canadian  Privacy   Commissioner  Jennifer  Stoddart  and  Commissioners  from  Germany,  New  Zealand,  the   Czech  Republic,  and  Estonia  (Cavoukian,  2013a).        Since  then,  the  PbD  has  been  organized  in  nine  application  areas  and  translated  into  37   different  languages  (Privacy  by  Design,  2014).  According  to  Cavoukian  (2012),  the  key   application  areas  in  which  the  PbD  research  is  currently  directed  are:     1)  CCTV/Surveillance  Cameras  in  Mass  Transit  Systems;     2)  Biometrics  Used  in  Casinos  and  Gaming  Facilities;     3)  Smart  Meters  and  the  Smart  Grid;     4)  Mobile  Devices  and  Communications;     5)  Near  Field  Communications  (NFC);     6)  RFIDs  and  Sensor  Technologies;     7)  Redesigning  IP  Geolocation  Data;     8)  Remote  Home  Health  Care;  and     9)  Big  Data  and  Data  Analytics.      Previous  PbD  research,  however,  has  not  been  focused  on  education.  Some  studies  have   been  done  with  the  focus  on  mobile  communications  technologies,  but  there  was  no   specific  focus  on  mobile  learning.  Those  studies  examined  the  design  and  architecture  of   Mobile  Location  Analytics  (MLA)  (Cavoukian,  Bansal  &  Koudas,  2014),  Near  Field   Communications  (NFC)  technologies  in  mobile  devices  (Cavoukian,  2011),  and  the   privacy  practices  for  mobile  devices  (Cavoukian  &  Prosch,  2010;  Cavoukian  &  Weiss,   2012;  Cavoukian,  2013b).  The  purpose  of  every  paper  published  by  Cavoukian  in  this  

  30  

         field  was  to  produce  guidelines  or  a  set  of  practical  steps  that  could  be  taken  by  all   players  in  the  industry  (e.g.,  device  manufacturers,  operating  system  and  platform   developers,  network  providers,  application  developers,  and  users)  to  build-in  privacy   protections  and  make  the  design  of  mobile  technologies  safer  and  more  user-centric.        2.3.3.  Criticism  and  Challenges  of  PbD   PbD  is  not  a  theory  that  can  be  used  in  academic  research  to  develop  and  test   hypotheses.  It  is  considered  to  be  a  guideline  that  can  be  used  as  a  practical  tool  to   establish  ethical  business  practices  with  the  user  privacy  in  mind.  Even  though  PbD  is   often  referred  to  as  a  "conceptual  framework",  it  is  actually  a  set  of  seven  principles  that   don't  have  relationships  between  each  other  or  influence  each  other  in  any  way.  For  this   reason,  PbD  cannot  be  applied  in  constructing  and  testing  theoretical  models,  i.e.,  it   cannot  be  applied  for  making  predictions  in  any  industry  or  area  of  research.      Despite  the  theoretical  shortcomings,  PbD  is  still  considered  one  of  the  most   comprehensive  guides  for  embedding  and  protecting  user  privacy  across  different  areas   in  our  Digital  Age.  The  unique  value  of  this  approach  is  that  it  recognises  the  importance   of  embedding  privacy  in  operations  and  technology  to  protect  the  users  and  not  only  the   companies.  However,  PbD  has  flaws  and  limitations  in  the  way  it  suggests  to  embed  and   protect  privacy.      While  the  critics  of  the  PbD  do  not  say  that  the  approach  is  bad  or  wrong  in  any  way,   they  point  out  that  PbD  cannot  be  implemented  because  the  framework  lacks  practical   and  feasible  methodology  of  implementation.  The  most  common  criticism  towards  PbD   in  the  literature  is  that  the  7  Principles  of  the  framework  are  too  vague  (Cürses  et  al.,  

  31  

         2011;  Spiekermann,  2012)  and  don't  elaborate  on  how  privacy  can  be  embedded  into   systems  from  an  engineering  perspective  (Cürses  et  al.,  2011;  Birnhack  et  al.,  2014).   Previously  cited  in  this  thesis  articles  by  Ann  Cavoukian  describing  the  methods  of   application  of  PbD  in  different  areas  of  business  and  technology  do  not  provide  specific   technical  steps  on  how  to  implement  PbD,  and  only  suggest  managerial  initiatives.  This   is  likely  the  reason  why  Birnhack  (2013)  calls  PbD  "a  legal  attempt  to  shape  technology"   (p.30),  suggesting  that  there  is  a  difference  between  understanding  the  technology  from   the  regulatory  and  from  the  engineering  perspectives;  and  that  in  order  for  PbD  to  be   effective,  the  framework  has  to  present  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  technical  aspects.      Spiekermann  (2012)  asserts  that  PbD  faces  some  challenges  even  if  managers  and   engineers  work  together  to  provide  more  specific  and  technical  guidelines  of  how  PbD   should  be  applied.  She  identifies  three  concerns:     1) Privacy  is  a  poorly  defined  concept  and  is  often  confused  with  security;  to   protect  privacy,  all  the  actors  have  to  know  what  exactly  they  are  trying  to   protect.   2) There  is  no  "agreed-upon  methodology  [that]  supports  the  systematic   engineering  of  privacy  into  systems".   3) There  is  a  lack  of  information  on  what  are  the  benefits  and  risks  "associated  with   companies'  privacy  practices".  (Spiekermann  2012,  p.38.)      Mulligan  and  King  agree  that  a  tool  that  could  help  in  "translation  privacy  into  design"   does  not  yet  exist  (2014,  p.  982).  They  argue  that  before  developing  any  methods  of   embedding  privacy  as  a  default  setting,  the  regulators  should  ensure  that  their  methods   are  economically  sound  and  that  companies  would  be  able  to  afford  developing

         solutions  with  the  desirable  forms  of  privacy  protection  (Mulligan  &  King,  2014).  From   the  review  of  the  publications  promoting  PbD  and  from  the  7  Principles  of  PbD  it  is   unclear  whether  this  framework  considered  the  financial  aspect  at  all  when  developing   recommendations  for  companies.      It  is  important  to  note  that  none  of  the  critics  dismiss  the  PbD  as  a  valuable  framework   completely,  but  they  strongly  establish  that  there  are  certain  weak  points  in  the  PbD   approach  and  it  needs  further  development  and  improvement.  There  are  new   technological  advances  and  tools  being  developed  every  day;  it  is  hard  for  regulators  to   stay  on  top  of  the  innovations  and  to  provide  methods  for  protecting  privacy  for  the   tools  and  products  that  go  through  their  technological  life  cycles  faster  than  their   potential  effect  on  privacy  can  be  discovered.  PbD  is  an  example  of  policymakers   recognising  "the  power  of  technology  to  not  only  implement,  but  also  to  settle  policy   through  architecture,  configuration,  interfaces,  and  default  settings"  (Mulligan  &  King,   2014,  p.992).      

  
2.3.4.  Applying  PbD  Principles  to  App-Based  M-Learning   There  are  no  recommendations  available  specifically  for  mobile  learning  applications,   but  Cavoukian  &  Prosch  (2010)  developed  a  set  of  requirements  for  all  mobile   application  developers  in  general.  These  requirements  or  recommendations  for   implementing  PbD  include  the  following  actions  and  tasks  that  mobile  app  developers   should  undertake  (adapted  from  Cavoukian  &  Prosch,  2010):   · Inform  users  about  how  they  use  their  data  and  provide  timely  notices  about  any   changes.   · Employ  informed  consent  if  they  gather  any  personal  information  from  the  users.     33  

        

· ·

Utilize  appropriate  security  practices.   Practice  data  minimization  techniques:  do  not  collect  more  information  from  the   users  than  needed  for  the  app  to  function  and  to  provide  good  user  experience.   There  should  be  "collection  limitation"  and  it  should  be  specified  for  what   purposes  personal  information  is  collected.  

·

App  developers  should  protect  the  personal  data  they  collect  throughout  the   entire  lifecycle  of  the  data  ­  from  data  collection  stage,  to  data  use  and  storage,   and  until  these  data  are  no  longer  needed  and  should  be  destroyed.    

·

All  the  security  practices  implemented  by  the  app  developers  should  be  clearly   documented.  

   One  of  the  objectives  of  this  research  was  to  examine  if  PbD  can  help  the  developers   design  m-learning  apps  that  protect  their  users'  privacy.  As  can  be  seen  from  the   summary  recommendations  outlined  above,  PbD  provides  steps  of  what  has  to  be  done,   but  not  how  it  should  be  done.  This  example  supports  the  previously  expressed   concerns  by  some  researchers  (Cürses  et  al.,  2011;  Spiekermann,  2012;  Birnhack,  2013;   Birnhack  et  al.,  2014)  that  PbD  is  currently  not  mature  enough  as  a  model  to  be   successfully  implemented  because  it  doesn't  provide  any  practical  tools  or  methods  to   achieve  Privacy  by  Design.  PbD  framework  could  work  as  an  ethical  guide  for  managers,   but  it  needs  to  evolve  methodologically  to  become  useful  and  practical  for  engineers   and  software  developers.        Nonetheless,  based  on  PbD  Principles  at  their  current  stage  of  maturity,  I  developed   some  guidelines  for  the  review  of  m-learning  applications  in  this  research.  Based  on  the  

  34  

         actions  that  PbD  suggested  for  the  app  developers  to  take,  I  composed  several  questions   that  had  to  be  answered  during  the  review  of  the  m-learning  apps'  privacy  policies:      · Does  the  app  have  a  privacy  policy  or  make  its  privacy  information  available  for   the  users  in  any  way?       · · Does  the  app  ask  for  the  consent  to  collect  user  information?   Does  the  app  notify  the  users  about  the  changes  in  privacy  policy  or  any  changes   in  the  use  of  personal  information?   · Is  it  possible  for  the  users  to  opt-out  from  sharing  their  information  with  the   app?   · Is  there  enough  transparency  in  communication  privacy  information  to  the   users?     · · Is  there  any  explanation  of  how  the  personal  data  is  used  and  for  what  purposes?   Is  it  explained  how  the  user  data  is  protected?  Who  can  access  personal   information  that  users  share  with  the  app?        These  questions  helped  to  identify  red  flags  in  the  way  some  applications  communicate   privacy  information  to  their  users.  Chapter  4  present  the  results  of  this  examination  of   the  m-learning  apps'  privacy  communications.  Further  application  of  PbD  in  app-based   m-learning  will  be  explored  in  Discussion  part  of  this  thesis  (see  Chapter  6).

   Both  secondary  and  primary  data  were  collected  for  this  research.  A  quantitative   method  was  applied  to  collect  primary  data.  These  data  were  collected  by  administering   an  online  questionnaire.  The  research  was  approved  by  the  Ryerson  University's   Research  Ethics  Board  (REB)  (see  Appendix  C).  The  survey  study  involved  minimal  risks   to  the  participants  and  was  not  experimental  in  nature.  Section  3.3  presents  the  design   and  procedure  for  the  survey  instrument.  The  secondary  data  included  reviews  of  the   academic  publications,  white  papers,  media  articles  and  reports,  government  policies   and  other  publicly  available  materials.  In  addition,  secondary  data  such  as  applications'   privacy  policies  and  terms  of  conditions  were  reviewed  for  the  investigation  on  what   mobile  learning  apps  do  with  their  users'  information.  This  review  helped  in  designing  a   survey  for  the  collection  of  primary  data.  The  next  Section  3.2  explains  the   methodological  considerations  for  collection  and  analysis  of  the  secondary  data.     

3.2.  Selection  Criteria  for  the  Apps  for  Privacy  Policies  Review  
   I  selected  the  apps  presented  in  this  chapter  without  using  any  special  software  to  find   the  relevant  applications  and  information  on  them.  As  pointed  out  by  Maske  et  al.   (2011),  no  m-learning  application  dominates  the  market,  because  there  is  a  lack  of   standards  for  m-learning  app  development.  With  more  than  1,600  new  apps  being   added  to  app  stores  on  a  daily  basis  (Article  29  Data  Protection  Working  Party,  2013),  it

         was  difficult  to  manually  process  all  the  apps  that  are  self-described  as  m-learning  or   mobile  learning  applications  and  select  those  which  are  relevant  to  the  scope  of  this   study.  A  representative  sample  of  various  apps  targeted  at  adult  learners  was  selected.   These  apps  were  included  in  the  review  because  of  their  diversity  in  subject  matter,   developers,  target  consumers,  prices  and  platforms.  Table  3-1  (at  the  end  of  this  section   of  the  thesis)  provides  a  summary  of  the  basic  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  the  m- learning  apps  that  were  selected  for  analysis.      This  research  is  focused  primarily  on  the  interactive  m-learning  applications.  The   "Information  source"  apps  (see  Chapter  1  for  definition)  are  not  covered  in  this  study,   because  they  are  not  interactive  and  hence  do  not  fall  under  the  category  of  m-learning   applications  as  defined  in  this  thesis.  The  referential  tools  and  the  info-libraries  are  not   included  in  the  review  as  well,  because  they  can  also  be  classified  as  the  "information   source"  tools.        Arguably,  apps  that  have  only  video  content  or  present  animations,  or  deliver  materials   in  form  of  eBooks  or  any  other  downloadable  content,  can  be  considered  mobile   applications  for  the  purpose  of  learning.  However,  there  are  too  many  of  such  systems   currently  available  on  the  market  and  they  often  do  not  require  their  users  to  actively   engage  in  the  learning  process.  These  applications  also  trigger  fewer  privacy  concerns,   because  the  users  are  not  asked  to  upload  their  own  files  for  assessment  or  to  engage  in   online  discussions  with  other  learners  or  course  instructors.  Therefore,  to  make  the   research  narrower  and  more  specific,  any  m-learning  apps  that  solely  present   information  and  do  not  facilitate  collaborative  learning  were  disregarded.  Only  m-

         learning  apps  that  offer  users  a  possibility  of  self-assessment  or  checking  their  progress   were  reviewed.        In  addition,  a  few  of  the  Learning  Management  Systems  (LMS)  available  for  mobile   devices  and  app-based  mobile  learning  platforms  were  included.  A  Learning   Management  System  or  LMS  is  a  software  application  used  for  the  delivery  and   management  of  the  learning  content  and  resources.  An  LMS  usually  allows  for  the   learner  registration,  the  delivery  and  tracking  of  the  courses  or  training  programs,  and   also  for  student  testing.  (Training  Force,  2014.)  Most  Learning  Management  Systems   (LMS)  are  designed  for  desktop  computer  or  a  laptop  and  often  don't  cater  content  for   mobile  devices  such  as  smartphones,  which  is  why  only  a  small  number  of  LMSs  are   included  in  this  study.      The  iTunes  University  app  (iTunes  U)  was  included  in  the  list  of  LMS  applications  even   though  it  is  a  course  management  system  rather  than  a  learning  management  system.  The   difference  between  such  systems  is  that  usually  LMSs  are  more  interactive  and  support   collaborative  learning  and  communication  with  course  instructors.  At  the  time  when   iTunes  U  was  first  launched  in  2007  (Apple  Press  Info,  May  30,  2007),  it  provided   nothing  more  than  some  open-source  course  materials  (e.g.,  videos,  lecture  transcripts,   audio  files,  reading  materials,  etc.)  from  different  universities.  However,  today  the  users   of  iTunes  U  can  take  self-assessment  tests  to  check  their  progress  and  understanding  of   the  material.  Many  courses  now  also  provide  various  assignments  (as  homework)  for   the  users  to  apply  to  a  practical  task  what  they  learnt  from  lectures.  For  these  reasons,  it   was  decided  not  to  exclude  iTunes  U  app  from  the  review.

         Similarly  to  LMSs,  most  MOOCs  are  primarily  web-based  learning  tools.  The  review   includes  only  application-based  solution.  Some  MOOCs  such  as  Coursera  have  recently   released  apps  for  iOS  and  Android  devices,  but  since  those  apps  weren't  initially   designed  as  mobile  learning  solutions,  they  were  not  reviewed  for  this  study.  MOOC   apps  have  yet  to  be  developed  and  redesigned  to  cater  for  mobile  users.      The  selected  sample  originally  included  56  apps,  but  was  narrowed  down  to  28  due  to   similarities  between  some  of  the  apps  and  because  of  the  lack  of  interactive  features  or   low  popularity  of  the  excluded  apps.  In  October  2014,  I  was  contacted  by  some   representatives  of  the  learning  management  systems  that  were  competing  for  the   contract  with  the  Ryerson  University  to  replace  Blackboard  that  is  currently   implemented  for  the  university.  These  companies  had  no  impact  on  the  study  and  just   expressed  their  interest  in  the  results  of  the  survey  research.  After  some  consideration,   I  decided  that  some  of  the  companies  competing  with  Blackboard  have  to  be  included  in   the  review,  provided  that  they  had  a  good  application  available  for  mobile  devices.  Thus,   a  total  number  of  the  apps  included  in  the  study  was  31.  10  of  those  apps  were  LMSs.      Table  3-1:  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  the  m-learning  apps  for  review   Inclusion  Criteria   App-based  solution   · Interactive   Provide  an  option  of  checking  learner's   · progress  /  Has  assessment  feature   · Apps  that  are  available  for  download   for  free  or  should  be  purchased  ­  both   of  these  categories  had  to  be  included   Available  for  download  in  Canada   · · Exclusion  Criteria   Web-based  mobile  learning  solutions   (don't  have  an  application)   Apps  that  are  targeted  only  for  little   kids   Apps  that  just  present  information  and   have  no  interactive  features,  don't   actively  engage  student  participation  in   a  course   Apps  with  very  similar  contents   Not  available  in  English

            The  results  of  this  stage  of  the  research  are  presented  in  the  Chapter  4  of  this  thesis.     

3.3.  Quantitative  Study  
   3.3.1.  Target  Population  and  Sample   The  target  group  for  this  study  was  adults  over  the  age  of  18.  There  were  no  specific   exclusion  criteria  other  than  age.  The  population  of  interest  included  people  of  any   gender,  any  educational  background,  and  any  occupation.  As  defined  by  the  purposes  of   this  study  (see  Chapter  1),  both  current  users  of  the  mobile  learning  applications  and   any  potential  or  prospective  users  had  to  be  included  in  the  research,  which  broadened   the  potential  participants  to  include  any  adult,  anywhere  in  the  world,  with  access  to  the   survey.  Though  the  research  was  not  catered  specifically  for  Canadians,  more  than  70%   of  the  participants  were  residents  of  the  province  of  Ontario.      The  participation  in  this  research  was  voluntary  and  anyone  who  had  a  link  to  the   survey  could  participate,  which  is  why  it  was  hard  to  determine  a  specific  sample.  Non- probability  or  convenience  sampling  was  used  for  this  study.  The  participants  were  self- selected  volunteers,  which  raised  the  possibility  of  undercoverage  and  voluntary   response  bias  in  this  survey  study.  A  pilot  study  was  conducted  to  minimise  the   potential  biases.      The  participants  were  recruited  via  email  and  social  media.  I  had  access  to  the  contact   list  of  the  Privacy  and  Cyber  Crime  Institute  of  the  Ryerson  University,  which  included   about  6000  subscribers  (although  I  don't  know  how  many  of  those  6000  email     40  

         addresses  were  still  active  at  the  time  of  the  research).  The  subscribers  of  the  Privacy   and  Cyber  Crime  Institute  were  mostly  students,  faculty  and  staff  of  the  Ryerson   University,  some  technology  journalists,  and  associates  of  the  Institute.  Considering  that   the  subscribers  of  the  Privacy  and  Cyber  Crime  Institute  might  be  generally  more   apprehensive  about  privacy  issues  than  other  people,  it  was  not  specified  that  the  focus   of  the  study  would  be  on  privacy  concerns.  This  was  also  done  in  order  not  to  lead  the   participants  and  to  counter  response  and  sampling  bias.        The  survey  was  also  distributed  through  Twitter,  LinkedIn,  Reddit,  Google+,  Facebook   and  Couchsurfing.  In  addition,  I  also  asked  my  colleagues,  peers  and  friends  to  share  the   link  with  their  contacts,  which  is  why  it  would  be  hard  to  estimate  how  many  people  in   total  saw  the  invitation  to  participate  in  the  study.      The  sample  size  was  260  participants.  According  to  Alvin  C.  Burns  and  Ronald  F.  Bush   (2014),  I  calculated  the  margin  of  error  for  this  sample  and  confidence  level  95%  using   the  following  formula:      Margin  of  sample  error  formula     ± = 1.96×    In  this  formula  "n"  is  our  sample  size,  and  both  "p"  and  "q"  stand  for  the  variability  in   the  responses  to  any  given  question  of  the  survey.        ×    

  41  

         The  values  of  "p"  and  "q"  should  always  sum  to  100%.  Burns  and  Bush  (2014,  p.  242)   explain  that  "[a]  50/50  split  in  response  signifies  maximum  variability  (dissimilarity)  in   the  population,  whereas  a  90/10  split  signifies  little  variability."  Since  the  target   demographics  include  everyone  above  the  age  of  18,  there  is  a  possibility  of  significant   differences  in  the  responses.  Hence,  to  calculate  the  maximum  margin  for  sampling   error,  we  should  assume  that  both  "p"  and  "q"  stand  for  50%.  As  a  result,  the  margin  of   sample  error  in  this  survey  research  would  be  ±6.07%.      50×50 2,500 = 1.96× = ±6.07   260 260

± = 1.96×   

In  conclusion,  at  a  95%  confidence  level,  there  is  a  margin  of  error  of  about  ±6%  in  the   sample  results.  This  means,  for  instance,  that  if  45%  of  people  sampled  answered  that   they  were  familiar  with  m-learning  applications  and  used  them  before,  we  can  be   confident  that  between  39%  (=45%  -  6%)  and  51%  (=45%  +6%)  people  in  general  have   tried  using  mobile  learning  applications  (considering  that  the  margin  of  error  is  plus  or   minus  6%).      3.3.2.  Survey  Design   The  pilot  questionnaire  was  composed  of  28  questions  and  took  approximately  20   minutes  for  the  respondents  to  complete.  Suggestions  from  other  researchers  and   Ryerson  University  faculty  also  helped  to  compose  questions  to  avoid  leading  the   participants  and  reduce  the  researcher's  bias.  Administrating  a  pilot  survey  helped  in   determining  whether  the  participants  were  able  to  follow  instructions,  whether  the  

  42  

         questions  were  phrased  clearly  enough  for  the  respondents  to  understand,  and  whether   there  are  any  errors  previously  unidentified  by  the  researcher.      The  results  of  the  pilot  questionnaire  helped  to  determine  which  questions  were  more   important  than  others  for  the  purposes  of  the  research.  The  respondents  of  the  pilot   questionnaire  were  able  to  leave  comments  in  the  text  box  answer  options  for  some  of   the  questions.  The  participants  of  the  pilot  study  left  comments  regarding  several   questions,  suggested  additional  answer  choices  and/or  rephrasing.  These  comments   provided  a  valuable  feedback  for  improving  the  survey.  The  survey  was  redesigned  to   take  10  minutes  instead  of  20  minutes.      The  final  survey  used  to  collect  the  data  included  21  close-ended  and  partially   structured  questions:  fixed  response  questions  with  a  possibility  for  the  respondents  to   add  their  own  answer  or  opinion  in  the  "Other"  text-box  reply  options.  7-point  Likert   scale  rating  questions  were  used  to  find  out  how  respondents  feel  about  particular   issues  and  to  find  out  about  their  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  mobile  learning   applications;  whereas  5-point  Likert  scale  questions  were  used  to  determine  some  of   the  usage  patterns,  such  frequency  of  use  of  the  m-learning  apps,  user  familiarity  with   the  apps,  etc.  Most  of  the  5-point  Likert  scale  items  were  deleted  from  the  final   questionnaire,  because  the  pilot  survey  revealed  that  those  questions  do  not  contribute   to  the  research  purposes  and  have  no  impact  on  other  variables.  After  all  the  changes   and  improvements  of  the  survey  design  were  made,  the  average  completion  time  for  the   survey  became  10  minutes.

         The  online  survey  site  was  set  up  using  FluidSurveys  survey  software  tool2,  which  is  a   multi-lingual  survey  tool  that  supports  multiple  different  question  types  and  has  an   option  of  custom  formatting  and  editing.  Using  this  survey  instrument,  I  was  able  to   create  multiple-choice  questions,  closed-ended  dropdown  menu  questions,  open-ended   text  questions,  checkbox  questions  (to  allow  respondents  select  multiple  answers  per   question),  and  multiple  choice  grid  questions  (to  present  many  variable  in  one  question   in  a  table).        There  were  no  significant  physical,  psychological,  social,  economic,  or  legal  harm  that   could  result  from  the  participation  in  this  research.  This  was  a  simple  minimal  risk   research  protocol.  The  only  minor  risk  associated  with  this  study  was  the  possibility   that  the  participants  could  feel  fatigued  or  inconvenienced  as  a  result  of  taking  the   survey.      The  questionnaire  asked  personal  information  such  as  age,  gender,  whether  the   respondents  were  residents  of  Ontario  or  any  other  area  in  or  outside  of  Canada,  and   what  were  the  occupations  of  the  respondents.  Despite  those  questions,  no  personally   identifiable  information  (e.g.,  names,  addresses,  email  addresses,  etc.)  was  collected.   Moreover,  the  respondents  had  a  possibility  to  not  provide  the  answers  for  those   questions  by  choosing  a  response  option  "Prefer  not  to  answer".  The  respondents'  age,   gender  and  level  of  education,  and  their  use  of  m-learning  applications  (have  or  have   not  used  before,  frequency  of  use)  were  used  as  control  variables  in  contingency  tables   with  the  other  study  factors.

         Apart  from  the  questions  that  collected  the  basic  demographic  information  about  the   participants,  the  survey  included  questions  that  were  set  to  investigate  user  privacy   concerns,  attitudes  toward  m-learning  applications'  user  data  collection  and  third  party   sharing,  and  the  usage  patterns  of  m-learning  apps.  Those  questions  were  divided  into   four  categories  and  mixed  in  the  questionnaire  (presented  to  the  participants  in  non- consecutive  order)  to  avoid  getting  the  participants  focused  on  some  particular   concerns,  avoid  leading  them  or  suggesting  opinions,  and  to  keep  them  from  getting   bored,  fatigued  or  irritated  with  long  questions.  Each  of  the  survey  study  factors   included  up  to  seven  questions,  because,  according  to  Chong  et  al.  (2011),  having  more   than  one  question  asked  for  each  factor  is  important  for  reducing  response  bias.        Survey  item  selection  was  primarily  based  on  the  information  collected  from  the  review   of  the  privacy  policies  of  the  m-learning  applications.  Some  questions  included  more   than  one  variable  (see  all  of  the  survey  questions  with  the  answer  choices  in  the   Appendix  F).  For  instance,  questions  10-13  included  up  to  11  variables  to  explore  the   importance  of  different  m-learning  apps'  properties  or  features  for  users  and  the  levels   of  users'  concerns  about  the  apps'  abilities  to  access  different  types  of  personal   information.  The  purpose  of  these  questions  was  to  find  out  how  users  feel  about   sharing  different  types  of  information  about  themselves  and  their  app  usage  with  the   app  developers  and  any  possible  third  parties.  The  full  list  of  variables  included  in  the   survey  research  can  be  found  in  the  Appendix  G.

         3.3.3.  Procedure   The  participants  were  not  identified  or  specifically  selected  for  the  study.  There  was  no   compensation  or  payment  for  the  participation  in  this  study.  The  participation  was   voluntary  and  anonymous.        The  pilot  survey  was  deployed  on  July  31st,  2014.  The  survey  was  live  (i.e.,  open  to   collect  responses)  for  13  days  from  July  31st  to  August  12th,  2014,  inclusive.  207  adults   over  18  years  old  agreed  to  participate  in  the  pilot  study,  but  only  123  of  them   completed  the  questionnaire.  The  outcomes  of  the  pilot  study  revealed  the  need  to   modify  and  shorten  the  survey.  I  reviewed  the  comments  from  the  pilot  study   participants  and  made  changes  in  the  survey  design.  The  full-scale  survey  was  deployed   on  October  16th  and  collected  responses  until  December  10,  2014.  Clear  instructions   were  provided  for  the  participants  of  the  study  in  the  beginning  of  the  survey.        Participants  were  asked  to  give  their  informed  consent  to  participate  in  the  study.  The   participants  were  not  asked  to  provide  any  personally  identifiable  information.  The   intentions  of  the  survey  data  collection  were  explained  in  the  consent  form  provided   prior  to  the  survey  questions,  to  ensure  that  the  respondents  understood  the  objectives   of  the  study  and  what  would  be  asked  of  them.  The  participants  were  able  to  withdraw   their  consent  to  participation  at  any  stage  of  taking  the  survey  by  closing  the  browser   tab  with  the  survey  link.  All  the  recruitment  materials  and  the  Consent  Form  for  the   participation  in  the  study  were  scripted  to  comply  with  the  2nd  edition  of  Tri-Council   Policy  Statement:  Ethical  Conduct  for  Research  Involving  Humans3  (TCPS  2).

Chapter  4  ­  M-Learning  Applications  and  Their  Privacy   Policies  
   The  privacy  policies  and  Terms  of  Use/Service  (ToS)  of  31  m-learning  applications  were   reviewed  for  this  study.  As  was  mentioned  in  the  previous  chapter,  eleven  of  the   reviewed  applications  were  LMSs.  Table  5-1  presents  a  list  of  mobile  learning  apps   reviewed  and  the  results  of  the  review  including  the  types  of  the  data  they  collect,  store   and  share  about  their  users;  as  well  as  the  applications'  prices  and  user  ratings.  The   user  ratings  can  change  between  the  different  app  versions  and  for  different  OS  or   devices  (iOS  and  Android  apps  may  have  different  ratings  due  to  differences  in  the   designs),  which  is  why  the  average  user  ratings  for  all  versions  of  the  apps  are   presented.        Given  that  privacy  legislation  and  related  laws  vary  across  the  world,  the  developers   home  country  was  specifically  noted.  In  some  cases  the  data  collected  from  the  users  is   protected  and  shared  according  to  the  regulations  of  the  countries  of  the  apps'   developers  and  not  the  location  of  the  users.        While  it  would  be  logical  to  assume  that  m-learning  apps  from  different  countries  may   define  personal  information  differently  in  their  privacy  communication  to  the  users,  a   review  of  the  privacy  policies  suggests  that  the  language  used  in  such  documents  is   similar  regardless  of  where  an  app  was  developed.  Terms  such  as  "personal   information"  and  "aggregated  non-personal  data"  were  used  in  almost  every  privacy   policy.  American  developers  avoided  using  the  popular  (in  the  USA)  abbreviations  "PII"  

  48  

         and  "Non-PII",  which  may  be  explained  by  the  developers'  intentions  to  target  audience   outside  the  USA  and/or  to  make  the  language  of  the  privacy  policies  easier  to   understand  by  not  using  specialized,  industry-specific  terms.      This  and  other  information  was  gathered  about  the  applications  to  create  a   comprehensive  profile  and  to  identify  possible  patterns  or  relationship.  However,  no   apparent  relationship  between  the  apps'  sizes,  prices,  ratings,  target  markets,  or   subjects  and  the  privacy  policies  of  the  apps  have  been  observed.  In  general,  most  of  the   applications  had  quite  similar  policies  that  were  obviously  phrased  to  protect  the   interests  of  the  developers  and  providers  rather  that  the  users.  None  of  the  policies   specifically  identified  which  third  parties  had  access  to  user  information,  and  the   information  gathered  was  defined  quite  vaguely  and  could  potentially  be  much  more   broad  than  the  users  might  suspect.          When  this  research  was  originally  conducted  in  May  2014,  13  or  42%  of  the  31   applications  included  in  the  review  did  not  have  a  privacy  policy  at  all,  which  is  an   alarming  number  for  such  small  sample.  However,  in  January  2015  all  of  the   applications  were  reviewed  again  for  changes  in  their  privacy  policies  and/or  how  they   communicate  privacy  information  to  the  users.  By  that  time  only  7  apps  (or  22.5%)   from  the  original  list  still  did  not  provide  a  privacy  policy  to  their  users,  a  decrease  of   almost  50%.      Among  those  apps  that  had  a  privacy  policy,  most  did  not  have  it  available  within  the   mobile  app,  but  required  their  users  to  find  the  website  of  the  application  provider  or   the  developer  to  access  this  information.  This  creates  unnecessary  obstacles  for  the  

  49  

         customers  who  should  not  be  forced  to  search  for  these  documents  on  the  internet  or   contact  a  company  directly  for  this  information.  Documents  such  as  privacy  policies  and   terms  of  service  should  be  easily  and  immediately  accessible  for  all  users.      Based  on  user-accessible  privacy  policies  and  terms  of  use,  it  was  found  that  m-learning   applications  presented  in  the  sample  collect  all  or  most  of  the  following  data  from  their   users:   · Registration  data:  usually  includes  a  user's  name  and  email  address,  and   occasionally  other  personal  details  such  as  mailing  and  billing  addresses,  phone   number,  business  information,  etc.   · Shipping  and  billing  information:  shipping  and  billing  addresses,  credit  card   number  and  expiration  date.   · Aggregate  data:  aggregated  non-personal  data  usually  includes  information   about  usage  patterns  such  as  the  frequency  of  application  use,  nature  of   inquiries,  etc.  It  is  usually  collected  to  find  out  how  the  app  is  being  used  and   determine  how  it  can  be  improved  based  on  this  information.   · Transmission  data:  the  information  regarding  what  content  a  user  sends   through  the  app  and  whom  he/she  sends  it  to.   · Log  data  or  the  app  and  the  site  usage  information,  if  some  content  is   available  via  browser:  the  information  about  a  user's  browser,  domain  name,   IP  address,  the  web  pages  he  or  she  visits  and  how  much  time  is  spent  on  every   webpage.  This  information  is  usually  not  linked  to  the  users  personally,  but   considering  that  the  IP  addresses  are  retained,  we  can  argue  that  an  individual   can  be  identified  via  this  information.

   The  review  of  the  privacy  policies  revealed  not  only  specific  types  of  data  collection  and   tools  for  doing  the  collection,  but  also  outlined  some  instances  of  how  data  can  be   stored,  managed,  and  resold.  The  most  common  aspect  of  data  management  relevant  to   a  privacy-conscious  user  is  a  business  transfer.  According  to  the  reviewed  policies,  the   companies  may  sell,  transfer,  or  otherwise  share  some  or  all  of  their  assets  in   connection  with  a  business  transaction,  merger,  reorganization,  or  in  the  event  of   bankruptcy  or  selling  their  company  to  another  entity.  When  this  happens,  the  users'   information  is  usually  regarded  as  one  of  the  assets  transferred.  Some  applications  take   the  responsibility  for  notifying  their  users  in  case  of  business  transfers  and  consequent   transfer  of  the  user  data  to  another  company.  However,  some  may  transfer  or  sell  user   information  without  notice,  in  which  case  users  would  not  be  aware  of  the  business

         transfer.  Only  4  out  of  the  31  companies  included  in  the  review  mentioned  in  their   privacy  policies  that  they  would  notify  their  customers  in  case  of  business  transactions   when  they  have  to  provide  some  other  party  with  all  the  users'  PII  and  Non-PII  (e.g.   when  a  company  enters  bankruptcy,  is  acquired  by  a  third  party,  or  in  case  of  a  merger).      It  was  often  specified  in  the  reviewed  privacy  policies  that  an  application  may  collect   any  personal  or  demographic  information  from  their  users  if  the  users  provide  such   information  voluntarily.  This  is  a  misleading  phrasing,  because  users  of  those  apps  have   to  provide  personal  information  to  register  for  these  services,  and  they  can't  use  the   service  without  prior  registration.  Opting  out  from  providing  any  personal  information   means  you  cannot  use  the  application,  which  is  not  the  same  as  making  a  choice   between  not  providing  any  personal  information  to  the  app  and  voluntarily  sharing   some  information  while  already  being  a  user.  A  note  on  this  is  most  explicitly  written  in   the  Privacy  Policy  of  Qualcomm  (provider  of  QLearn  LMS),  which  has  a  special  section   "Opting  out"  with  the  following  explanation  on  how  users  can  opt  out  from  providing   their  personal  information  to  the  app:        "You  can  stop  all  collection  of  information  by  the  Apps  by  uninstalling  the  Apps."   (QLearn  Privacy  Policy,  2014).      In  other  words,  if  learners  want  to  protect  their  privacy  using  m-learning  apps,  they   have  only  one  choice  ­  not  to  use  m-learning  application  at  all.  This  is  not  a  choice  but   rather  an  ultimatum  from  the  service  providers,  as  it  forces  users  to  provide  whatever   information  is  asked  of  them  if  they  want  to  use  the  service/tool.  Users  are  offered  no   granularity  in  the  control  of  their  own  personal  data.  Knowing  that  some  learners  

  52  

         cannot  opt  out  from  using  the  tool  no  matter  what  (e.g.,  some  apps  might  be  obligatory   for  university  students  or  for  some  employees  to  use  as  part  of  their  course  program  or   professional  training),  the  applications'  providers  can  exploit  their  advantageous   position  and  start  collecting  and  sharing  any  of  their  users'  personal  information  for  any   reason  without  notice.  Currently,  there  is  no  penalty  for  such  behaviour,  and  the   providers  can  always  say  that  the  users  could  have  protected  their  information  by   refusing  to  use  an  application.      In  fact,  we  cannot  know  the  extent  to  which  the  applications  collect  and  share  user  data,   because  there  is  an  obvious  lack  of  transparency  in  every  privacy  policy.  The  third   parties  who  are  given  access  to  the  users'  information  are  never  explicitly  named.  Every   privacy  policy  lists  the  circumstances  and  the  reasons  for  sharing  the  user  data  with   these  third  parties,  but  it  is  also  clear  that  a  "third  party"  could  be  basically  anyone.      On  a  positive  side,  it  was  interesting  to  note  that  the  reviewed  m-learning  applications   do  not  directly  monetize  their  users'  information  with  third  parties  for  unrelated   marketing  purposes.  Although  they  do  share  user  information  with  third  parties  to   market  their  own  products.  This  phrasing  is  somewhat  controversial  and  tricky.

         In  all  the  reviewed  privacy  policies  it  was  stated  that  an  application  collects  and  uses   their  users'  personal  information  to  improve  their  services.  While  I  agree  that  having   some  personal  information  on  individual  users  can  help  in  providing  personalized  user   experience,  it  is  not  clear  why  an  application  needs  to  collect  data  on  its  users  about   anything  beyond  their  personal  preferences  regarding  the  use  of  this  application.  For   example,  it  is  unclear  why  the  developers  of  a  mobile  learning  app  need  to  know  the   users'  IP  addresses,  their  unique  device  identifiers,  or  business  contact  information  to   improve  the  service  for  those  users.  It  should  be  explicitly  explained  to  the  users  how   this  information  is  used  to  make  the  user  experience  better,  if  it  is  really  the  purpose  of   collecting  such  information  to  begin  with.  Only  a  couple  of  the  applications  profiled  for   this  study  elaborated  in  their  Privacy  Policy  what  they  do  to  provide  a  "better  service"   for  their  users  (Canvas  and  QLearn).  I  suspect  that  not  all  of  the  collected  user  data  is   required  to  maintain  a  good  quality  service  and  to  provide  a  personalised  experience,   and  that  a  lot  of  data  is  gathered  not  for  the  benefit  of  the  learners,  but  to  help  the   application  in  marketing  their  own  services  to  the  users  and  to  third  parties.  A  more  in- depth  inquiry  on  how  the  mobile  learning  applications'  user  data  is  utilized  and   manipulated  by  the  service  providers  and  developers  can  yield  interesting  insights  and   should  be  explored  in  the  further  research  beyond  the  scope  of  this  thesis.      All  the  applications  included  in  the  sample  may  share  any  user  data  with  the   government  to  comply  with  the  legal  processes.  In  fact,  a  privacy  policy  of  almost  every   of  the  reviewed  apps  has  an  identical  paragraph  on  this  subject.  Since  the  phrasing  is   similar,  the  following  sentence  should  give  a  general  idea  to  the  reader  about  the   content  of  such  paragraph  on  legal  issues:

         We  may  release  Personal  Information  when  we  believe  in  good  faith  that  release  is   necessary  to  comply  with  the  law  (such  as  to  comply  with  a  subpoena,  a  court   order,  or  a  search  warrant);  enforce  or  apply  our  Terms  of  Service  and  other   agreements;  or  protect  our  rights,  property,  or  safety  of  our  employees,  our  users,   or  others.      One  can  argue  that  sentences  phrased  in  such  manner  could  release  the  apps'  providers   from  any  responsibility  of  keeping  user  data  confidential.      Most  of  the  developers  warn  that  the  users  should  use  caution  when  deciding  what   information  and  content  to  share  through  their  apps.  They  also  add  that  if  they  provide   links  to  the  third  parties'  websites  or  apps  on  their  m-learning  application,  they  are  not   responsible  if  a  user  clicks  on  those  links.  It  is  also  stated  in  ToSs  that  that  the  app's   providers  cannot  guarantee  the  safety  of  user's  information  and  cannot  inform  what   type  of  personal  information  could  be  accessed  by  the  party  that  the  link  belongs  to,  and   how  the  user's  data  could  be  used  by  this  party  if  the  user  clicks  on  the  link  provided  by   the  developer.  Simply  put,  the  providers  and  developers  wash  their  hands  of  the   responsibility  over  the  protection  of  the  user  information  if  a  user  follows  the  links   suggested  by  the  developer.  Shifting  a  responsibility  for  the  information  protection  to   the  users  is  not  an  optimal  solution  when  it  comes  to  designing  a  secure  user-centric   and  safe  mobile  application  for  learning.  The  developers  should  avoid  designing   solutions  that  would  direct  the  users  to  the  untrusted  third  parties.      Generally  speaking,  all  of  the  m-learning  apps  that  had  a  privacy  policy  share  user   information  with  some  third  parties.  We  can  assume  that  the  apps  that  did  not  have  an  

  67  

         explicit  privacy  policy  or  even  a  ToS,  operate  by  the  similar  principles.  The  only   difference  is  that  the  users  have  no  way  of  knowing  what  information  is  being  collected   from  them  and  how  this  information  is  stored,  shared,  and  protected.      In  conclusion,  none  of  the  applications  reviewed  were  transparent  about  what   information  they  collect  from  their  users  and  how  they  use  this  information.  This  lack  of   transparency  was  manifested  in  different  ways:  1)  some  applications  didn't  use  clear   language  describing  what  they  do  with  user  information;  2)  a  couple  of  the  apps  had  a   redirection  loop  ­  Privacy  Policies  referred  to  ToS  for  more  information,  while  ToS  said   that  the  information  about  user  data  collection  can  be  found  in  the  Privacy  Policy,  but   neither  of  these  documents  provided  any  information  on  the  issue;  3)  some  apps  didn't   make  their  privacy  information  easily  available  and  some  didn't  provide  it  at  all.      As  was  briefly  mentioned  in  Chapter  2,  in  the  spring  of  2014,  the  GPEN  Sweep  took   place  and  assessed  1,211  mobile  apps  (not  only  mobile  learning  apps,  but  also  various   types  of  applications  for  mobile  devices).  This  sweep  involved  26  privacy  enforcement   authorities  from  around  the  world,  including  the  Office  of  the  Privacy  Commissioner   (OPC)  of  Canada.  43%  of  the  assessed  apps  did  not  tailor  their  privacy  policies  for  small   screens,  which  means  that  users  cannot  easily  read  these  apps'  the  privacy  information   on  mobile  devices.  The  OPC  examined  151  of  the  1,211  apps  and  found  that  26%  of   those  examined  don't  have  a  presence  of  a  privacy  policy.  (Cohen,  2014.)  Based  on  this   review,  the  OPC  developed  a  10-step  guideline  for  the  mobile  apps  developers  and   providers.  The  guidelines  are  broken  down  into  three  categories  that  suggest  the   developers  to  (A)  be  more  transparent,  (B)  explain  what  they  do  with  user  information,   and  (C)  make  privacy  policies  accessible  for  users.  These  suggestions  were  composed  to

         help  the  providers  present  the  privacy  communications  to  their  users  in  an  accessible   way,  to  achieve  better  transparency  between  the  apps  providers  and  the  users,  to  gain   user  trust  and  implement  better  business  practice.  In  addition,  these  steps  could  help   the  developers  and  providers  comply  with  Personal  Information  Protection  and   Electronic  Documents  Act  (PIPEDA).  (OPC  Fact  Sheets,  2014.)  The  developers  of  the  m- learning  apps'  included  in  the  sample  for  the  study  in  this  thesis  should  take  these   recommendations  under  consideration  as  well.  More  detailed  information  on  the  OPC's   recommendations  can  be  found  in  Appendix  B.      The  review  of  the  privacy  policies  and  ToSs  helped  identify  what  information  is   collected  on  the  user  and  in  what  cases  and  with  whom  this  information,  or  a  part  of  it,   can  be  shared.  This  review  clearly  established  that  companies  differentiate  between  PII   and  Non-PII,  and  collect  these  data  for  different  purposes.  This  knowledge  raised  a   question  whether  the  users  care  for  what  purposes  and,  more  importantly,  what   information  exactly  is  shared  and  with  whom.  This  was  explored  in  the  survey  research   discussed  in  the  next  chapter.

Chapter  5  ­  Results  of  the  Survey  Study  
  

5.1.  Data  Preparation  Process  
   As  described  in  Chapter  3,  data  were  collected  from  the  respondents  through  an  online   survey  tool  over  a  period  of  56  days.  I  used  FluidSurveys  online  survey  software  to   collect  the  data.  After  the  data  were  collected,  the  raw  responses  of  267  completed   questionnaires  were  exported  into  Excel  for  initial  analysis.  Next,  I  manually  entered  the   raw  data  from  Excel  into  SPSS  Statistics  22  to  create  data  file  and  data  output  for   analysis.        The  accuracy  of  the  entries  was  checked  several  times  by  visually  comparing  the  entries   in  the  SPSS  and  the  raw  data  in  Excel,  as  well  as  by  conducting  a  basic  descriptive   analysis  within  FluidSurvey,  and  then  in  Excel  and  SPSS  to  ensure  that  there  were  no   discrepancies.  The  SPSS  data  file  was  also  checked  for  mistakes  such  as  out  of  range   scores.  Such  mistakes  were  unlikely,  because  data  was  exported  to  Excel  and  then   copied  into  SPSS  from  there;  but  the  data  file  still  had  to  be  checked  for  common  errors   in  the  data  entry.        Initially,  75  variables  were  created  in  SPSS  Statistics  22  data  file  for  21  questions  of  the   survey,  because  some  questions  investigated  the  respondents'  view  on  several  issues  of   concern.  Two  sets  of  separate  variables  were  entered  for  two  questions  that  allowed  the   participants  select  more  than  one  answer  choices.  One  of  those  variables  was  deleted   after  the  visual  examination  of  the  dataset  revealed  that  no  one  chose  that  answer  

  70  

         option  (Answer  "I  don't  know"  for  Question  9:  "Which  of  the  following  features  you   hope/expect  to  see  in  m-learning  application?  Choose  everything  that  applies.").  Later,   additional  2  variables  were  created  to  analyse  demographic  information  provided  by   the  participants.  Therefore,  a  total  of  76  variables  were  created  for  the  survey  analysis.      For  the  next  step  in  the  analysis,  the  data  file  was  checked  for  internal  respondent   errors.  There  was  the  possibility  that  some  respondents  might  click  on  the  same   response  option  for  all  the  questions  to  go  through  the  survey  quicker.  Three  such   questionnaires  were  found  and  excluded  from  further  analysis.        Next,  I  examined  the  data  for  missing  values.  Initial  examination  indicated  that  most  of   the  participants  didn't  skip  many  questions  or  provided  an  answer  for  every  question  of   the  survey.  However,  two  questionnaires  contained  the  answers  only  for  the  questions   about  the  respondents'  age  or  gender  and  residence,  with  all  other  values  missing.   These  questionnaires  were  excluded  from  further  analysis  as  they  contained  no  data   relevant  to  the  study.        According  to  Dong  and  Peng  (2013),  there  is  no  established  standard  in  the  literature  on   what  proportion  of  missing  data  is  acceptable:  some  researchers  suggest  5%,  while   others  assert  that  the  results  of  the  analysis  can  be  biased  if  more  than  10%  of  data  is   missing.  Referring  to  Tabachnick  and  Fidell  (2012),  they  make  a  point  that  patterns  in   the  missing  data  have  a  greater  effect  on  the  results  than  the  percentage  of  missing  data   in  general  (Dong  &  Peng,  2013).  The  dataset  for  this  research  was  further  analysed  for   missing  values  and  two  cases  were  found  with  more  than  10%  responses  missing.  These   cases  were  examined  closely  and  it  was  uncovered  that  the  data  were  missing  not  at  

  71  

         random:  it  was  obvious  that  the  respondents  skipped  a  set  of  questions  for  some  reason   (e.g.,  the  respondents  were  undecided  about  their  opinion  on  the  issues,  experienced   fatigue  or  boredom,  or  were  anxious  to  finish  the  questionnaire  quicker).  For  this   reason,  these  questionnaires  had  to  be  eliminated,  which  left  us  with  260  responses  for   the  formal  in-depth  statistical  analysis  of  the  results.

   400  people  agreed  to  participate  in  the  study,  but  only  267  of  them  took  the   questionnaire  and  completed  it,  which  indicates  a  completion  rate  at  67%.  The  average   completion  time  for  the  survey  was  10:09  minutes.  As  was  discussed  in  the  previous   section,  after  the  responses  were  entered  in  SPSS  Statistics  22,  the  data  were  examined   and  cleaned,  and  7  questionnaires  were  eliminated  from  the  sample.  Thus,  the  final   sample  for  the  analysis  included  260  completed  questionnaires.        Among  the  participants  who  chose  to  reply  to  the  question  about  their  year  of  birth   (230  out  of  260),  the  age  range  was  53  years,  with  the  respondents  of  the  survey  being   from  18  to  71  years  old.  The  average  age  of  the  participants  was  35.  The  majority  of  the   respondents  were  between  25  and  34  years  old  (see  Figure  5-1  below).

5.3.  The  Sample's  Familiarity  With  M-Learning  Applications  
   Among  260  participants,  117  people  (45%  of  the  respondents)  said  that  they  have  used   or  are  currently  using  mobile  learning  applications.  63  respondents  (24%)  were   familiar  with  m-learning  applications,  but  have  never  used  them  before.  Almost  31%  or   80  people  responded  that  they  were  completely  unfamiliar  with  such  applications  and   have  never  used  them.  This  means  that  only  45%  of  the  participants  were  m-learning   app  users,  while  the  rest  of  the  sample  can  be  considered  potential  users  of  such  apps.   Almost  70%  of  the  participants  knew  about  m-learning  applications  regardless  whether   they  have  ever  used  such  applications  (Figure  5-4).      When  respondents  were  asked  whether  they  have  ever  used  m-learning  applications,   55%  responded  that  they  have  not;  yet  on  the  question  about  how  often  the  participants   use  these  apps  only  48.1%  (N=125)  responded  that  they  never  use  m-learning   applications.  This  difference  in  the  results  indicates  that  there  was  some  inconsistency   in  the  participants'  answers.        21.2%  (N=55)  of  the  participants  replied  that  they  use  the  m-learning  applications  at   least  sometimes,  and  21.5%  or  56  people  said  they  use  them  rarely.  Only  2%  of  the   participants  reported  using  m-learning  applications  "a  lot".

  77  

         The  question  about  the  frequency  of  use  of  the  apps  was  composed  using  5-point  Likert   scale  items  with  the  answer  choices  from  1  ­  for  never  using  the  m-learning  apps,  to  5  ­   using  such  apps  a  lot  (Figure  5-5).  The  mean  for  this  question  was  1.93  and  the  standard   deviation  was  1.076.      The  results  of  the  survey  indicate  that  the  people  who  are  the  most  familiar  with  m- learning  apps  are  adults  under  34.  People  who  had  Master's  and/or  undergraduate   degrees  used  m-learning  apps  most  often.  No  significant  differences  were  identified  in   the  familiarity  with  m-learning  applications  and  frequency  of  use  of  these  tools  between   men  and  women.  The  following  bar  charts  (Figures  5-6  to  5-11)  were  created  to  visually   present  the  results  about  the  use  of  m-learning  apps  in  correlation  with  the  sample's   demographic  information.

   Figure  5-11:  Frequency  of  use  of  m-learning  application  and  the  participants'   education  levels      Among  people  who  said  that  they  have  never  used  m-learning  apps  before,  the  most   common  reasons  for  not  using  such  applications  were:   · · "Didn't  need  to  use"  ­  31.4%   "Didn't  know  about  such  apps"  ­  28.6%  

8.5%  of  the  participants,  who  have  never  used  m-learning  apps,  said  the  reason  for  this   is  that  they  didn't  want  to  pay  for  such  apps.  All  the  other  reasons  provided  by  the   respondents  for  not  using  m-learning  apps  were  less  significant.  Only  2  people  replied   that  they  have  never  used  m-learning  apps,  because  they  did  not  agree  with  privacy   settings  of  the  apps  they  wanted  to  install.  2  other  people  said  they  did  not  use  m- learning  apps,  because  they  did  not  want  to  give  the  required  permissions  to  those  apps.  

  81  

         Thus,  privacy  settings  were  not  a  major  reason  for  the  respondents  to  decide  not  to  use   m-learning  apps.  The  importance  of  the  privacy  settings  and  permissions  for  the  users  is   explored  further  in  this  report.     

5.4  Privacy  Concerns  and  the  Importance  of  Privacy  Settings  
   The  majority  of  those  who  reported  using  m-learning  applications  said  that  they  use   those  apps  mostly  on  smartphones  (65.8%).  Tablets  were  on  the  second  place  as  the   preferred  device  for  accessing  m-learning  content  (29.1%  of  the  respondents  who   use/used  m-learning  apps).        I  became  familiar  with  different  types  of  applications,  their  features  and  functionalities   after  conducting  a  literature  review  and  reviewing  of  the  privacy  information  of   different  m-learning  apps.  This  knowledge  helped  me  in  composing  the  survey   questions  regarding  what  types  of  features  they  customized  in  their  m-learning  apps   and  what  type  of  features  they  would  like  to  see  in  the  m-learning  apps  that  they  use  or   could  use  in  the  future.  The  respondents  were  allowed  to  choose  multiple  options  for   those  questions.  The  following  figures  present  findings  about  features  that  the   participants  would  value  the  most  in  the  m-learning  apps.      113  respondents  said  that  they  customized  some  features  in  m-learning  applications.   Figure  6-12  shows  that  41  (or  36%)  of  those  respondents  customized  privacy  settings   of  their  m-learning  apps.  34  respondents  (30%  of  113  people  who  made  some  changes   in  their  m-learning  apps)  customized  the  permissions.  4  people  (3.5%)  chose  answer  

  82  

         option  "Other"  for  this  question,  and  three  of  them  elaborated  on  the  changes  they   made.  They  customized  the  following:   · "Referencing  announcements,  assignments,  lecture  notes  and  course  documents  I   have  previously  posted  for  students  on  Blackboard."   · · "Content  (chose  to  study  simplified  rather  than  traditional  Chinese  characters)."   "Notifications."  

See  Table  I-1  in  Appendix  I  for  the  details  on  information  presented  in  Figure  5-12   below.     

   Figure  5-12:  Settings  that  the  users  have  customized  in  their  m-learning  apps        The  questions  about  the  desired  features  ("What  features  would  you  like  to  have  in  a   mobile  learning  app?")  were  addressed  to  all  of  the  participants,  even  to  those  who  have   never  used  a  mobile  learning  application  in  their  lives,  because  people  who  are  not   using  mobile  applications  for  learning  can  still  become  users  in  the  future.  It  is  equally   important  to  find  out  the  opinions  of  the  potential  users  as  that  of  the  current  users.          83  

         Almost  50%  (N=128)  of  all  participants  said  that  they  would  like  to  be  able  to  see  and   customize  privacy  settings  in  the  m-learning  apps.  Almost  40%  (N=103)  reported  that   they  would  like  to  be  able  to  customize  permissions  (see  Figure  5-13  below  and  Table  I- 2  in  Appendix  I  for  more  details).  Figure  5-13  presents  different  features  from  most   selected  to  the  least  selected  by  the  participants  and  the  corresponding  numbers  of   respondents  or  how  many  people  from  the  sample  want  to  have  each  of  following   features.  Some  of  the  participants  who  chose  "Other"  answer  option  left  a  comment  that   they  would  like  to  see  full  replication  of  PC  environment  in  a  mobile  learning  app.

         study,  training,  learning  and/or  teaching  purposes.  They  had  to  rank  the  importance  of   each  factor  on  the  scale  from  1  (Very  important)  to  7  (Not  at  all  important).    Based  on   the  survey  results,  an  app's  Privacy  Policy  would  be  ranked  5th  in  order  of  importance   for  the  participants.  The  means  in  the  Figure  5-14  indicate  that  application  security  is   "important"  for  the  survey  participants,  and  the  privacy  policies  and  permissions  of  the   apps  are  either  "important"  or  "somewhat  important"  (See  Appendix  J  for  the  detailed   tables  of  means  with  the  standard  deviation  values).  The  most  important  factors  in  the   user  decision-making  about  m-learning  apps  seemed  to  be  their  device  compatibility,   the  content  of  an  app,  and  its  price.  The  participants  were  less  concerned  with  how   popular  the  application  was  (i.e.,  how  many  times  it  was  downloaded  and  installed);   many  people  chose  to  answer  that  the  app's  popularity  is  either  "somewhat  important"   or  "somewhat  not  important"  for  them.

            The  review  of  the  privacy  policies  (see  Chapter  4)  revealed  that  all  m-learning   applications  collect  some  information  from  their  users  to  provide  a  better  user   experience.  As  was  previously  discussed,  some  personal  information  has  to  be  collected   to  allow  the  application  to  function  properly  and  to  provide  a  personalized  experience   for  the  users;  however,  sometimes  it  is  unclear  why  some  applications  collect  certain   user  data.  For  instance,  if  an  app  presents  information  on  mathematical  formulas  and   teaches  its  users  to  apply  those  formulas  in  different  problems,  why  would  it  collect   location  data  and  ask  an  access  for  user  contacts?  I  asked  the  participants  how  much   they  agree  that  a  mobile  learning  application  could  collect  their  personal  information  in   order  to  "improve"  the  mobile  learning  apps'  services,  as  the  apps  state  in  their  privacy   policies.  Figure  6-15  presents  the  results  in  a  bar  chart  of  means:  the  means  were   calculated  based  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale  question,  in  which  the  respondents  chose  a   reply  on  a  scale  from  1  ­  for  "Strongly  Agree  [that  this  information  should  be  collected]",   to  7  ­  "Strongly  Disagree  [that  this  information  should  be  collected]".  As  can  be  seen   from  Figure  6-15,  the  participants  tend  to  strongly  disagree  that  an  app  should  collect   their  credit  card  information  to  allow  for  basic  use  of  the  app.  The  participants  tend  to   be  undecided  about  whether  they  would  agree  or  disagree  that  an  m-learning  app   should  request  to  collect  their  users'  browser  information,  email  addresses,  and  even   user  names.

         I  tested  the  relationships  between  the  participants'  demographic  profile  and  privacy- related  items  of  the  questionnaire.  For  this  purpose,  a  separate  data  entry  was  created   in  SPSS  Statistics  22,  that  included  only  50  variables:  4  independent  (age  group,  gender,   education,  and  the  participants'  familiarity  with  m-learning  apps)  and  46  dependent   variables  for  7-point  Likert  scale  items.  The  latter  items  mostly  explored  user  concerns   and  feelings  about  m-learning  apps  collecting  and  sharing  user  data  with  third  parties.  I   created  184  contingency  tables  and  performed  chi-square  tests  based  on  the  survey   data  to  see  if  there  were  any  observable  relationships.  I  used  a  separate  data  file  and  a   separate  output  for  this  analysis  for  convenience  purposes  only,  i.e.,  not  to  mix  chi- square  test  results  with  other  tests  and  tables  in  the  analysis.  Chi-square  tests  did  not   reveal  that  the  participants'  levels  of  familiarity  with  m-learning  apps  made  any   difference  in  their  opinions  about  m-learning  apps'  practices  of  collecting  and  sharing   user  information.  In  other  words,  the  responses  about  the  preferred  features  and   concerns  about  privacy  did  not  vary  depending  on  whether  the  respondents  used  m- learning  apps  before  or  did  not  know  anything  about  such  apps.  In  general,  chi-square   analysis  did  not  provide  much  insight  into  possible  relationships  between  the   participants'  demographic  profile  and  their  responses;  nevertheless,  high  significance   levels  were  observed  for  some  variables.  I  looked  for  results  where  p  <  0.05,  because  the   p-value  associated  with  a  95%  confidence  level  is  0.05.  Results  where  p  <  0.01  had  a   confidence  level  of  99%.      The  chi-square  results  suggested  that  there  might  be  a  relationship  between  users  age   group  and  how  important  is  a  size  of  an  application  for  them  if  they  want  to  install  it  (p   =  0.008).    There  was  also  an  indication  that  there  was  a  significant  difference  between   the  sexes  in  the  responses  about  the  importance  of  device  compatibility  in  an  app  (p  =

         Price  has  different  importance  for  users  of  different  age  groups:  the  results  indicate  that   the  older  respondents  tend  to  care  less  about  the  price  of  an  application  when  they   decide  whether  to  install  a  mobile  learning  app.  The  comparison  of  means  revealed  that   people  between  18  and  24  care  about  the  price  much  more  than  people  between  45  and   54,  which  makes  sense,  because  45  years  old  or  older  users  most  likely  have  more   steady  income  than  people  under  24  (see  Appendix  K).        There  was  also  a  variation  in  responses  between  people  with  different  levels  of   education  and  how  important  are  such  factors  as  course  offerings  (or  content)  of  an   application  and  an  app's  size.    People  with  a  Doctorate  degree  or  equivalent  cared  about   the  content  of  an  app  a  bit  more  (Mean  =  1.42  on  a  scale  from  1  to  7,  were  1  is  "Very   important")  than  people  who  graduated  from  college  (Mean  =  2.05)  or  had  a  Masters   degree  (Mean  =  1.93).  People  without  post-secondary  education  also  mostly  replied  that   a  "course  offerings"  is  an  important  factor  (Mean  =  1.67).  Those  with  a  higher  level  of   education  cared  less  about  the  size  of  an  application.  People  with  just  a  High  School   diploma  replied  that  size  is  somewhat  important,  but  people  with  Master's  or  Doctorate   degrees  mostly  replied  that  it's  somewhat  not  important  to  them.      There  was  also  a  slight  variation  in  responses  about  the  importance  of  an  app's   popularity  for  the  users.  People  without  any  post-secondary  education  tended  to   respond  that  number  of  an  app  installs  (or  how  popular  an  app  was  among  users)  was   somewhat  important  for  them,  while  is  was  not  very  important  for  people  with   undergraduate  degrees.

         The  participants'  reaction  to  user  data  collection  didn't  vary  much  between  different   groups  of  respondents.  Figure  5-15  in  this  Chapter  presented  the  general  respondents   on  this  subject.  The  only  slight  variation  observed  was  related  to  the  collection  of  email   address  from  the  users.  Most  participants  were  undecided  whether  an  app  really  needs   to  ask  them  for  their  emails,  but  people  from  35  to  44  years  old  tended  to  reply  that   they  somewhat  disagree  that  an  application  has  to  collect  their  email  addresses  to  allow   for  basic  functionalities.      User  concerns  about  Permissions   The  ANOVA  test  results  revealed  there  was  a  significant  difference  in  responses   between  genders  about  user  attitudes  towards  granting  to  a  mobile  learning  app  such   permissions  as  access  to  data  sharing  via  Bluetooth  and  access  to  the  user's  Cloud.    The   survey  results  indicate  that  women  are  concerned  when  an  app  asks  them  to  grant   access  to  their  Bluetooth  and  the  Cloud,  while  men  are  only  a  little  concerned  about  it.   (See  the  tables  with  comparison  of  means  and  ANOVA  results  in  Appendix  K.)      Other  observed  differences  in  responses  about  m-learning  applications'  permissions   and  how  users  feel  about  granting  those  permissions  varied  between  participants  of   different  age  and  education  levels.  Significant  differences  in  responses  (with  95%   confidence  level)  between  age  groups  included  different  levels  of  concerns  about   permissions  to  access  contacts  on  the  devices  of  the  respondents  (p  =  0.013),  access   calendars  (p  =  0.002),  notes  and  reminders  on  the  devices  (p  =  0.001),  and  access  to   social  networks  (p  =  0.004).  A  comparison  of  means  revealed  the  following  trends  (see   Appendix  K  for  descriptive  tables):

When  looking  at  the  responses  of  people  from  18  to  44,  the  more  concerned  they   were  about  granting  to  an  application  permission  to  access  their  contacts.  This   trend  seems  to  start  moving  in  another  direction  in  responses  of  participants   from  45  and  older.  The  greater  difference  (p  =  0.024)  was  in  responses  between   people  under  24  (generally  concerned)  and  in  the  age  group  from  35  to  44  (very   concerned).

A  clear  trend  can  be  seen  in  responses  about  granting  an  app  permission  to   access  calendar:  younger  respondents  were  somewhat  concerned  about  it,   leaning  towards  undecided  (participants  from  18  to  24  years  old),  and  the  older   the  participants  were,  the  more  they  were  concerned  (people  over  45  were  the   most  concerned  about  it).  

·

Similar  trends  were  observed  in  responses  about  concerns  if  an  application   required  permissions  to  the  Notes/reminders.  People  under  24  were  somewhat   concerned,  but  then  the  levels  of  concern  rose  according  to  the  ages  of  the   respondents.  People  from  45  to  54  were  the  most  and  very  concerned.  However,   the  concern  level  then  falls  again  to  generally  "concerned"  in  responses  of   participants  over  55.

The  observed  trend  in  responses  about  concern  levels  when  an  app  requires   access  to  social  networks'  profiles  was  the  same  as  with  access  to  notes  and   reminders.  From  18  to  54,  the  older  the  respondents  were,  the  more  concerned   they  reported  to  be  about  an  app  accessing  their  social  networks'  profiles  (from   just  concerned  to  very  much  concerned).  There  was  no  difference  in  responses   between  people  from  34  to  44  and  over  55  years  old.  The  greatest  difference  (p   =  0.049)  was  in  responses  between  people  under  24  and  from  45  to  54:  younger

         respondents  were  significantly  less  concerned  about  granting  permissions  to   access  social  networks.   · The  older  the  participants  were,  the  more  they  were  concerned  about  granting   permissions  to  access  Bluetooth.  People  over  55  were  concerned  about  it  more   than  people  under  34,  but  post-hoc  analysis  showed  the  difference  was  not  too   dramatic.  Answers  varied  from  "concerned"  (for  older  people)  to  "somewhat   concerned"  (for  younger  respondents).   · Comparison  of  means  revealed  a  clear  trend  of  people  being  "somewhat   concerned"  (Mean  =  2.81)  when  an  app  requires  permission  to  access  Dropbox   or  any  other  file  sharing  app  used  by  the  respondents,  when  the  respondents   were  under  24,  but  the  level  of  concern  grew  to  "concerned",  leaning  towards   "very  concerned"  among  older  respondents.  The  greater  difference  in  responses   was  between  people  under  24  and  people  over  55.        Similar  trends  were  observed  for  all  the  other  permissions:  in  the  responses  of  people   from  18  to  54  there  was  a  clear  progression  and  growth  of  concern  levels.  The  older   respondents  were,  the  more  concerned  they  were  about  granting  different  permissions.   But  in  responses  of  people  over  55  the  levels  of  concerns  dropped  compared  to   responses  of  people  from  45  to  54.  In  general,  reported  levels  of  concerns  of  people  over   55  were  almost  the  same  as  those  of  people  from  35  to  44.  The  biggest  difference  in   responses  was  always  between  people  of  18-24  and  45-54  years  old.  However,  for  all   other  types  of  permissions  those  differences  weren't  significant  enough  to  claim  that   there  were  some  correlations.

         ANOVA  tests  revealed  significant  differences  in  responses  between  people  with   different  levels  of  education  about  permissions  to  access  photos  (p  =  0.049),  access   calendar  (p  =  0.017),  access  notes  or  reminders  (p  =  0.020),  access  social  networks'   profiles  (p  =  0.006).  I  used  Bonferroni  procedure  for  comparisons  between  data  groups   after  the  one-way  ANOVA  analysis  to  find  out  the  most  significant  differences  in   answers  between  respondents  with  different  education.  The  most  significant   differences  were  between  the  following  groups:   · Between  people  who  completed  undergraduate  schools  and  people  who  had   Ph.D.  or  equivalent  level  of  education  in  their  replies  about  concerns  regarding   permission  to  access  calendar  (p  =  0.027).  Respondents  with  Bachelor's  degrees   tended  to  be  somewhat  concerned  about  it,  but  participants  with  Doctorate   degrees  were  much  more  concerned.     · Very  significant  difference  was  observed  in  responses  about  access  to  social   networks  between  people  with  Doctorate  degrees  and  people  who  finished  High   School  but  had  no  post-secondary  education  (p  =  0.004).  Less  educated  people   were  concerned  about  granting  this  type  of  permission,  but  respondents  who   completed  graduate  schools  were  more  concerned  about  it  (most  of  them   responded  being  very  concerned  if  an  app  requires  access  to  social  media   profiles).      Post-hoc  analysis  revealed  that  differences  in  responses  between  groups  of  interest  for   other  variables  were  not  significant  enough  to  report.  However,  a  comparison  of  means   still  revealed  some  interesting  tendencies:

The  higher  was  the  education  level  of  the  respondents,  the  more  they  were   concerned  if  an  app  required  permission  to  access  their  photos,  access  contacts,   access  calendar,  and  access  social  networks'  profiles.

People  with  graduate  degrees  were  more  concerned  about  granting  permissions   to  access  their  file-sharing  apps  compared  to  respondents  with  undergraduate   degrees  or  just  a  High  School  diploma.  

   User  levels  of  concern  when  an  app  shares  their  user  data  with  third  parties   I  asked  the  participants  how  concerned  they  would  be  (on  the  scale  from  1  ­  strongly   concerned,  to  7  ­  not  concerned  at  all)  if  a  mobile  learning  application  shares  their   information  with  third  parties.  One  of  the  questions  presented  different  types  of   information  that  could  be  collected  from  the  users,  and  I  asked  the  participants  how   would  they  feel  if  some  of  their  particular  data  were  shared  (see  Figure  5-16  in  this   Chapter  for  the  average  responses  of  the  sample)  with  any  independent  third  party.  I   didn't  specify  the  purpose  of  the  data  sharing.  There  were  no  significant  differences  in   responses  for  this  question  between  different  genders.  The  ANOVA  test  revealed   differences  in  responses  between  age  groups  about  the  concerns  if  an  app  shares  such   user  information  as  a  user  name  (p  =  0.002),  phone  number  (p  =  044),  and  email  (p  =   0.000).  The  post-hoc  test  found  the  most  significant  differences  between  multiple   groups,  in  particular:   · Responses  of  people  between  18  and  24  were  significantly  different  from  those   of  people  in  the  age  groups  25-34  (p  =  0.030),  35-44  (p  =  0.003),  and  over  55   years  old  (p  =  0.018).  The  comparison  of  means  showed  that  people  under  24  are   only  a  little  bit  concerned  if  an  app  shares  their  names  with  third  parties,  while   older  people  are  generally  concerned  if  that  happens.     97

People  between  35  and  44  answered  differently  about  how  worried  they  would   be  if  an  app  shares  their  phone  number  with  anyone,  compared  to  the  answers  of   people  under  24  (p  =  0.046):  the  older  respondents  were  very  concerned  about   such  possibility,  while  younger  people  were  concerned,  but  not  as  much.

The  comparison  of  means  revealed  a  linear  trend  that  the  older  the  respondents   were,  the  more  concerned  they  were  about  a  possibility  that  an  app  could  share   their  email  addresses  with  some  unknown  third  parties.  People  under  24  were   somewhat  concerned  about  it,  and  the  reported  levels  of  concern  increased   according  to  the  respondents'  age  to  the  point  that  the  participants  over  55  were   very  concerned  about  their  apps  sharing  their  emails  with  third  parties.  

     There  were  also  differences  in  responses  about  third-party  sharing  of  the  users'   information  among  people  with  different  education.  Significant  differences  in  responses   were  observed  only  regarding  sharing  email  addresses  (p  =  0.000)  and  phone  numbers   (p  =  0.005).  There  was  a  strong  indication  that  the  higher  degree  the  respondents  had,   the  more  they  were  concerned  about  those  issues  (see  Appendix  K  for  the  table  of   means).    Concerns  about  a  possibility  that  a  user's  phone  number  could  be  shared  with   some  unknown  third  parties  ranged  from  generally  just  "concerned"  to  "very   concerned".  People  without  post-secondary  education  tended  to  reply  that  they  were   "somewhat  concerned"  if  an  app  shares  their  emails  with  somebody.  The  levels  of   concern  on  this  issue  rose  proportionally  to  the  levels  of  the  respondents'  education,   and  people  with  graduate  and  postgraduate  education  were  very  concerned  about  it.

         Levels  of  concern  if  a  mobile  learning  app  shares  user  data  with  independent  third   parties  for  commercial  purposes   When  the  participants  were  asked  about  their  concern  level  if  an  app  would  share  their   personal  information  (PII)  with  any  third  party  for  marketing  purposes,  the  responses   did  not  differ  much  between  sexes,  but  there  was  a  variation  in  responses  between   people  of  different  age  (p  =  0.017).  A  post-hoc  analysis  revealed  that  the  biggest   difference  in  responses  was  between  groups  of  people  from  18  to  24  in  comparison  to   the  responses  of  people  over  55  (p  =  0.043).  Older  people  were  more  concerned  about   the  possibility  that  an  m-learning  app  they  use  (or  would  like  to  use)  could  share  their   personal  information  with  anyone  for  commercial  purposes.      While  the  variation  in  responses  between  people  with  different  levels  of  education  was   not  significant,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  comparison  of  means  presented  a  slightly   noticeable  trend:  the  higher  level  of  education  of  the  respondents,  the  more  they  were   concerned  if  an  app  shares  their  personal  information  with  third  parties  for  marketing   purposes.  It  would  be  interesting  to  explore  if  a  larger  and  more  random  sample  of   respondents  could  increase  the  significance  level  (p-value)  of  this  trend,  or,  in  other   words,  demonstrate  a  bigger  difference  in  responses  between  less  and  more  educated   people.      The  participants  were  also  asked  if  they  were  concerned  that  a  mobile  learning  app  they   use  could  share  their  usage  patterns  with  independent  third  parties  for  commercial   purposes.  The  usage  patterns  of  a  mobile  application  would  include  data  about  how   often  the  application  is  used,  which  courses/topics  are  accessed  the  most  by  the   individual  users,  and  how  much  time  a  user  spends  on  different  tasks  or  topics.  When  it  

  99  

         was  said  that  such  information  could  not  be  linked  to  an  individual  user  (i.e.,  would  not   be  personally  identifiable),  the  respondents  were  mostly  undecided  if  they  should  be   concerned  about  it.    There  were  no  significant  differences  in  responses  of  people  of   different  genders  or  education  levels.  Although,  the  comparison  of  means  showed  that   people  with  Doctorate  degrees  tended  to  respond  that  they  were  somewhat  concerned   about  it,  while  people  with  undergraduate  or  lower  degrees  were  mostly  undecided.   There  was  a  significant  variance  in  responses  of  the  participants  in  correlation  with   their  age:  people  under  24  were  undecided  on  the  issue  with  slight  inclination  of  being   "somewhat  not  concerned",  but  the  older  the  participants  were,  the  more  their   responses  leaned  towards  "somewhat  concerned".  Thus,  the  biggest  difference  on  this   matter  was  in  responses  between  groups  of  18-24  year  old  participants  and  those  of  55   and  older.          When  the  participants  were  asked  about  their  attitudes  towards  third-party  sharing  for   marketing  purposes  if  the  usage  patterns  shared  would  be  personally  identifiable  (PII),   the  respondents  tended  to  answer  that  they  were  concerned  about  it  (see  Figure  6-18).   The  responses  did  not  differ  between  people  either  according  to  their  genders  or  age.   However,  people  with  college  education  were  less  concerned  about  it  in  comparison   with  people  who  had  a  Master's  degree  (p  =  0.043).      Levels  of  concern  if  a  mobile  learning  app  shares  user  data  with  the  government   The  participants  reported  to  be  concerned  when  I  asked  how  much  they  would  care  if   the  personal  they  provided  to  their  m-learning  app  was  shared  with  the  government  for   any  reason.  Females  were  slightly  more  concerned  about  it  (Mean  =  1.82;  on  a  7-point   Likert  scale  from  1  ­  very  concerned,  to  7  ­  not  concerned  at  all)  than  males  (Mean  =  

100     

         2.31).  However,  there  were  no  significant  relationships  between  the  opinions  on  this   issue  and  the  age  or  education  of  the  respondents.      Just  as  with  the  question  about  third-party  sharing  of  aggregated  usage  patterns  data   (Non-PII)  for  commercial  purposes,  the  participants  tended  to  be  undecided  if  they   would  be  concerned  in  case  an  app  shares  their  Non-PII  with  the  government.  ANOVA   tests  did  not  reveal  any  differences  in  responses  on  this  question  between  people  of   different  age,  education  or  gender.  However,  when  I  asked  the  participants  how  would   they  feel  if  such  shared  usage  patterns  data  would  be  personally  identifiable,  they   tended  to  reply  that  they  would  be  concerned  about  it.  Those  responses  did  not  differ   depending  on  the  participants'  demographic  profile.        Further  interpretation  of  the  results  is  presented  in  the  next  and  concluding  Chapter  6.

6.1.  PbD  Approach  
   The  review  of  PbD  as  a  theory  revealed  that  it  is  not  specific  enough  to  be  used  as  a   technical  guide  for  the  m-learning  app  developers;  however,  it  could  be  adopted  as  a   regulatory  framework  to  set  the  ethical  standard  of  the  best  privacy  practices  for  the   developers  and  providers  of  the  mobile  learning  tools.  For  instance,  following  PbD   Principles,  m-learning  app developers should  limit  the  information  they  collect  from  their   users  to  only  what  is  absolutely  necessarily  for  the  app  to  function.  According  to  PbD,  it   is  insensitive  (and  potentially  dangerous  to  the  user)  to  collect  user  information  that  is   unnecessary  for  an  app  to  function,  but  may  be  perceived  by  the  developers  as   something  that  might  be  useful  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  even  if  an  app  doesn't  collect   anything  from  their  users,  the  developers  have  to  make  it  explicit  to  the  users  that   nothing  is  collected.  If  an  app  claims  to  collect  Non-PII,  then  it  should  be  explicitly  stated   what  kind  of  information  they  consider  Non-PII,  because  users  should  not  be  left   guessing  about  what  exact  information  is  collected  from  them,  and  they  may  disagree   that  certain  information  cannot  be  linked  to  them  personally.      The  PbD  concept  stresses  that  it  is  important  to  think  about  privacy  from  the  beginning,   from  the  design  and  development  stage  of  any  product.  In  the  process  of  conducting  this   research,  I  have  talked  to  different  developers  and  it's  obvious  from  those  conversations   that  none  of  them  intend  to  violate  their  users'  privacy.  However,  developers  may   prioritize  other  issues  above  privacy  concerns,  or  they  may  just  not  care  enough  to  look  

102     

         into  privacy  vulnerabilities  and  limit  the  information  that  would  be  automatically   collected  from  the  users.  This  is  precisely  why  the  PbD  principle  of  "Proactive  ­  Not   Reactive"  is  important  for  developers  to  adopt.  There  might  be  privacy  risks  to  the  users   that  even  developers  cannot  anticipate  and  it  is  important  to  develop  privacy- preserving  solutions  into  the  development  process  itself,  well  before  user  privacy  is   violated.  The  Principles  of  PbD  can  be  used  as  a  guide  for  the  developers  on  what  to   consider  (from  the  user  perspective)  when  deciding  what  information  needs  to  be   collected  from  the  users  and  how  to  communicate  to  the  users  about  how  and  why  their   information  is  collected.       

6.2.  Findings  from  the  Privacy  Policies  Review  
   One  of  the  primary  research  questions  for  this  project  was  "What  are  the  user  privacy   concerns  regarding  m-learning  applications  and  what  effect  do  these  concerns  have,  if   any,  on  the  use  of  m-learning  applications?"  I  reviewed  the  privacy  policies  of  several   mobile  learning  applications  to  identify  some  of  the  issues  that  needed  to  be  explored:   e.g.,  what  could  worry  the  users  and  with  what  they  might  disagree.  This  research   revealed  that  there  is  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the  privacy  policies  of  m-learning   applications.  The  privacy  policies  of  31  applications  were  reviewed  for  this  research,   and  not  all  of  those  applications  had  a  privacy  policy  or  any  privacy  statement.  Some   privacy  policies  were  merely  a  few  sentences  of  text  stating  that  they  don't  collect   personal  information  from  their  users,  but  may  collect  personally  non-identifiable  data   for  use  in  analytics.     

103     

         The  review  of  the  m-learning  apps'  privacy  policies  show  little  to  no  existing  adoption  of   the  Principles  of  PbD,  at  least  not  obviously  so.  As  was  mentioned  earlier,  the  privacy   policies  are  not  transparent  and  clear  enough  with  the  users  about  how  their  data  is   collected  and  used,  which  is  violates  the  6th  principle  of  PbD  ("Visibility  and   Transparency").  Most  of  the  privacy  policies  made  it  obvious  that  they  seek  to   accommodate  and  protect  the  providers  and  developers  rather  than  users  (e.g.,  in   almost  every  privacy  policy  it  was  said  that  the  app  would  share  user  information  with   the  government  if  they  feel  that  that  would  be  in  their  interests,  which  is  a  somewhat   ambiguous  reason  to  provide  user  data  to  the  government  parties).  It  is  understandable   that  the  developers  and  providers  would  want  to  protect  themselves  from  any  legal   action  or  misunderstanding  with  their  users  and  with  third  parties  about  the  use  of  the   data  they  collect.  However,  in  keeping  with  the  "Full  Functionality"  Principle  of  PbD,  I   feel  that  the  approach  to  privacy  protection  and  communicating  privacy  information   should  not  necessarily  have  trade-offs,  meaning  that  protecting  developers'  interests   should  not  mean  neglecting  users'  interest.  PbD  is  a  valuable  concept  because  it  dictates   that  users'  privacy  is  something  that  should  never  be  ignored  or  traded  for  something   else,  e.g.  for  security  or  some  functionality.     

6.3.  Survey  Findings  
   A  survey  study  was  conducted  to  find  out  how  and  if  users'  attitudes  towards  some   privacy  issues  affect  their  use  of  m-learning  applications  and  how  concerned  people   may  be  about  their  privacy  when  they  use  these  apps.  I  could  not  find  explicit  support   for  PbD  from  the  survey  results  of  the  potential  and  current  users.  The  results  indicate   that  privacy  policy  is  not  a  very  important  factor  in  the  users'  decision-making  when   104     

         they  have  to  select  a  mobile  learning  application  to  install.  However,  the  respondents   still  replied  that  a  privacy  policy  of  an  app  would  be  somewhat  important  to  them;   women  considered  it  to  be  a  bit  more  important  factor  than  men  did.  The  survey  study   revealed  that  participants  don't  agree  that  a  mobile  learning  application  has  to  collect   their  users'  credit  card  information,  phone  number,  address  and  business  contact   information  for  the  stated  purpose  of  allowing  for  basic  functionalities  and  to  provide  a   better  service  for  the  users.      The  research  revealed  that  the  respondents'  concerns  about  m-learning  applications  did   not  have  an  effect  on  their  use  of  m-learning  apps.  The  survey  showed  that  the  main   reason  people  do  not  use  m-learning  apps  is  because  they  are  unaware  of  them  or  don't   believe  they  need  them,  and  not  because  they  are  concerned  about  privacy  or  security   issues.  This  is  consistent  with  the  Technology  Acceptance  Model  (Davis,  1989),  which   states  that  one  of  the  main  factors  influencing  users'  decision  whether  to  use  new   technology  is  the  perceived  usefulness  of  this  technology.  The  observed  lack  of   familiarity  with  m-learning  apps  explains  why  the  respondents  provided  very  generic   answers  regarding  their  opinions  about  the  collection  and  sharing  of  user  information   by  m-learning  apps.  It  is  simply  difficult  to  have  a  strong  opinion  on  a  specific  aspect  of  a   service  you  are  not  using  frequently.      According  to  Blank,  Bolsover  and  Dubois  (2014),  who  proposed  "a  new  privacy   paradox",  young  people  are  more  concerned  about  their  privacy  on  the  internet  than   their  elders.  Assuming  that  the  perception  of  privacy  depends  on  social  circles,  younger   people  are  more  sensitive  to  privacy  issues,  because  their  social  circles  are  rapidly   expanding  (Blank  et.  al,  2014).  I  thought  that  the  younger  generation  might  have  more  

105     

         privacy-related  concerns  about  their  use  of  m-learning  apps,  because  they  might  be   more  familiar  with  the  technology  and  with  how  apps  use  their  data  than  older   generations.  I  also  assumed  that  younger  people  might  be  more  aware  about  digital   privacy  issues  and  worry  about  privacy  much  more  than  older  people,  but  it  would   seem  that  I  was  absolutely  wrong  in  this  assumption.  The  results  of  my  survey  are  not   directly  related  to  Blank  et.  al's  "new  privacy  paradox",  but  they  contradict  their   findings  that  younger  people  are  more  concerned  about  privacy  than  their  elders.  The   analysis  of  the  survey  results  showed  that  the  older  the  respondents  were  and  the   higher  their  level  of  education  was,  the  more  concerned  they  were  about  the  different   issues  explored  in  this  study.  These  issues  and  items  of  interest  included  granting  an   app  the  permissions  to  access  contacts,  Bluetooth,  and  any  file  sharing  service  (e.g.,   Dropbox)  on  the  users'  devices.  Furthermore,  people  under  24  were  generally  less   concerned  than  the  older  respondents  if  a  mobile  learning  app  shares  their  user   information  with  third  parties.        The  participants  with  higher  levels  of  education  than  other  respondents  were  more   concerned  that  an  app  might  share  their  phone  numbers  and  email  addresses  with  some   third  parties.  In  addition,  more  educated  people  (e.g.,  the  respondents  who  had  a   graduate  degree  compared  to  those  who  just  attended  college  or  had  no  post-secondary   education)  were  more  concerned  about  granting  permissions  to  access  social  networks,   calendars,  photos  and  contacts  on  their  mobile  devices.  More  educated  people  were  also   more  concerned  about  a  fact  that  mobile  learning  apps  share  their  aggregate  Non-PII  for   commercial  purposes.  On  average,  the  participants  tended  to  be  undecided  on  whether   they  should  be  concerned  about  it  or  not.  They  were  also  rather  undecided  about  their   feelings  regarding  sharing  Non-PII  with  the  government  and  there  were  no  significant

         differences  in  the  responses  between  people  of  different  age,  education,  or  gender.  The   results  also  suggest  that  the  users  have  a  tendency  to  be  less  concerned  about  sharing   their  Non-PII  aggregated  data  with  any  third  parties  rather  than  sharing  their  PII.  Based   on  these  findings,  we  can  hypothesize  that  the  levels  of  user  concern  or  their  attitudes   about  m-learning  apps  sharing  their  user  information  with  third  parties  depends  on  the   types  of  the  information  being  shared  and  not  the  identities  of  the  those  third  parties.      In  addition,  the  survey  results  presented  what  features  or  characteristics  of  m-learning   apps  are  the  most  important  for  the  users.  In  the  survey  study,  the  users  shared  what  is   the  most  important  for  them  when  they  select  which  mobile  learning  application  to   install,  and  what  would  they  want  for  mobile  applications  to  be  able  to  do  in  future  or   how  they  would  improve  those  apps.  In  general,  most  respondents  wanted  a  possibility   of  using  their  mobile  learning  apps  offline  (i.e.,  when  they  don't  have  internet   connection  on  their  mobile  devices)  and  they  also  wanted  a  possibility  to  see  their   learning  progress  or  see  their  grades.  Those  findings  would  be  valuable  for  the   developers  of  mobile  learning  solutions  and  they  can  use  this  information  to  develop   new  functionalities  and  offer  what  their  users  want  in  these  applications.     

6.4.  Limitations  
   Despite  the  comprehensiveness  of  this  study,  it  had  several  limitations.  First,  I  used   convenience  sampling.  Some  of  the  respondents  were  people  subscribed  to  the  Privacy   and  Cyber  Crime  Institute's  newsletter.  The  fact  they  are  subscribed  to  those  updates   means  that  they  are  probably  aware  of  some  digital  privacy  issues  and  may  think  about   privacy  more  than  any  other  average  person.  This  awareness  and  their  general  interest   107     

         in  the  privacy-related  issues  might  have  been  reflected  in  their  answers.  Second,  the   surveyed  population  for  this  research  appeared  to  be  mostly  highly  educated,  which   made  it  hard  to  ascertain  whether  there  was  a  strong  relationship  between  their  level  of   education  and  their  familiarity  with  the  m-learning  apps  or  how  they  felt  about  some   privacy-related  issues.  A  random  probability  sampling  method  would  have  reduced  a   sampling  error  and  bias,  but  it  couldn't  be  applied  due  to  exploratory  nature  of  this   study.       

6.5.  Implications  and  Further  Research  
   The  review  of  the  PbD  framework  revealed  that  it  cannot  be  applied  as  a  theoretical   model  and  could  not  be  used  to  make  any  predictions  or  develop  a  testable  model  for   this  research.  To  analyse  any  phenomenon  or  test  a  hypothesis  and  understand  a   problem,  a  theoretical  model  should  not  only  have  a  set  of  variables  needed  for  analysis,   but  also  should  define  those  variables  and  be  able  to  establish  relationship  between   them,  explain  and/or  predict  behaviour  of  those  variables,  make  assumptions,  and   interpret  results/outcomes.  The  relationships  between  the  PbD  Principles  and  their   impact  on  the  product  design  or  user  behaviour  are  not  sufficiently  established  and   need  further  development  to  be  used  as  a  theoretical  model  in  a  research.  However,  PbD   Principles  can  help  the  developers  better  communicate  privacy  information  to  their   users.  Moreover,  PbD  could  be  applied  as  a  regulatory  framework  or  a  quality  standard   for  privacy  practices  for  developers  and  providers  of  mobile  learning  applications.  The   work  on  PbD  development  into  a  more  practically  applicable  tool  should  be  continued,   and  some  specific  examples  should  be  added  for  every  one  of  the  7  Principles  to  help   achieve  compliance  with  PbD.     108     

            The  survey  findings  indicate  that  there  is  a  need  to  raise  awareness  amongst  the  Ontario   population  about  the  app-based  m-learning  technology  and  also  about  privacy  threats   in  mobile  applications  in  general.  It  seems  that  most  people  don't  see  the  benefit  in  m- learning  to  use  it  on  their  own  (i.e.  if  neither  their  school  nor  workplace  requires  them   to  use  m-learning  for  their  education  or  professional  development).  The  survey  results   suggest  that  user  concerns  regarding  Privacy  Policies,  Terms  of  Service,  Permissions,  or   app  design  are  not  the  primary  barrier  to  the  use  of  m-learning  apps.  Instead,  use  is   limited  because  there  is  a  general  lack  of  awareness  that  m-learning  applications  exist,   and  those  that  know  of  them  often  feel  that  they  do  not  need  to  use  such  applications.   The  researchers  and  the  m-learning  applications'  developers  should  explore  this   concept  of  need  to  find  out  what  makes  the  users  feel  like  they  need  to  use  a  particular   application.  Theories  such  as  the  Technology  Acceptance  Model,  Uses  and  Gratifications   theory  and  Diffusion  of  Innovation  theory  are  likely  to  apply  in  this  context  and  could   provide  a  valuable  insight  into  why  people  don't  use  m-learning  apps  more  often.  Such   inquiry  into  the  users'  motivations  and  intentions  to  use  an  app  would  also  be  beneficial   for  the  marketers,  because  it  could  reveal  how  to  appeal  to  the  customers  that  don't  feel   the  need  for  using  m-learning  tools.  It  would  be  a  great  step  forward  for  the  m-learning   industry  development  if  the  learners  would  choose  to  use  m-learning  apps  not  because   they  need  or  have  to  do  it  (e.g.,  when  they  are  driven  by  some  external  factors  such  as   school  requirements  or  an  obligatory  corporate  training  program),  but  because  they   genuinely  want  to  use  such  applications  on  their  own  initiative  for  their  personal  or   professional  development.     

109     

         The  findings  of  this  thesis  revealed  that  the  majority  of  the  respondents  are  quite   concerned  that  m-learning  applications  could  collect  their  PII  and  share  it  with  third   parties.  The  responses  indicate  that  users  don't  really  know  if  they  have  to  be  concerned   about  aggregated  Non-PII  that  is  collected  from  them  and  shared  with  various  third   parties  for  analytics  and  for  marketing  purposes.  It  means  that  there  is  a  lack  of   understanding  about  what  aggregated  data  is  and  whether  Non-PII  can  pose  any  privacy   or  security  threats  to  the  users.  Further  research  is  needed  to  explore  if  people  know   the  difference  between  personally  identifiable  information  and  personally  non- identifiable  information,  and  what  concerns  they  might  have  regarding  one  or  the  other.        The  results  of  the  survey  showed  that  people  are  slightly  more  concerned  about  a   possibility  that  an  app  might  share  their  information  for  commercial  purposes  than  if  an   app  shares  user  information  with  the  government.  Considering  that  most  of  the   respondents  were  Canadians  and  residents  of  Ontario,  we  can  infer  from  the  results  that   Canadians  trust  the  government  more  than  they  trust  corporations  or  commercial   organizations.  In  addition,  ANOVA  analyses  revealed  that  women  are  marginally  more   concerned  than  men  that  an  app  may  share  their  information  with  the  government.  The   survey  results  also  revealed  that  women  are  more  concerned  than  men  about  granting   an  app  the  permission  to  access  their  cloud  or  the  ability  to  share  information  via   Bluetooth.  Further  research  is  needed  to  determine  generalizability  of  these  findings   and  to  explore  why  there  is  a  difference  in  response  between  genders  regarding  these   types  of  permissions.          Finally,  based  on  the  observed  trends  in  the  participants'  responses  for  my  survey,  I   suggest  that  older  people  and  more  educated  people  are  more  concerned  about  their  

110     

         privacy  and  how  applications  use  their  information  than  younger  people,  because  they   probably  have  more  knowledge  about  the  privacy  risks.  Further  research  is  needed  to   develop  this  proposition.

Appendices  
Appendix  A  ­  The  7  Foundation  Principles  of  Privacy  by  Design  
Principle   1.  Proactive  not   Reactive;   Preventative  not   Remedial   Description  
Privacy  by  Design  is  characterized  by  proactive  rather  than  reactive   measures.  It  anticipates  and  prevents  privacy  invasive  events  before   they  happen.  PbD  does  not  wait  for  privacy  risks  to  materialize,  nor   does  it  offer  remedies  for  resolving  privacy  infractions  once  they  have   occurred  ­  it  aims  to  prevent  them  from  occurring.  In  short,  Privacy  by   Design  comes  before-the-fact,  not  after.   We  can  all  be  certain  of  one  thing  ­  the  default  rules!  Privacy  by  Design   seeks  to  deliver  the  maximum  degree  of  privacy  by  ensuring  that   personal  data  are  automatically  protected  in  any  given  IT  system  or   business  practice.  If  an  individual  does  nothing,  their  privacy  still   remains  intact.  No  action  is  required  on  the  part  of  the  individual  to   protect  their  privacy  ­  it  is  built  into  the  system,  by  default.   Privacy  by  Design  is  embedded  into  the  design  and  architecture  of  IT   systems  and  business  practices.  It  is  not  bolted  on  as  an  add-on,  after   the  fact.  The  result  is  that  privacy  becomes  an  essential  component  of   the  core  functionality  being  delivered.  Privacy  is  integral  to  the  system,   without  diminishing  functionality.   Privacy  by  Design  seeks  to  accommodate  all  legitimate  interests  and   objectives  in  a  positive-sum  "win-win"  manner,  not  through  a  dated,   zero-sum  approach,  where  unnecessary  trade-offs  are  made.  Privacy   by  Design  avoids  the  pretence  of  false  dichotomies,  such  as  privacy  vs.   security,  demonstrating  that  it  is  possible  to  have  both.   Privacy  by  Design,  having  been  embedded  into  the  system  prior  to  the   first  element  of  information  being  collected,  extends  securely   throughout  the  entire  lifecycle  of  the  data  involved  ­  strong  security   measures  are  essential  to  privacy,  from  start  to  finish.  This  ensures   that  all  data  are  securely  retained,  and  then  securely  destroyed  at  the   end  of  the  process,  in  a  timely  fashion.  Thus,  Privacy  by  Design  ensures   cradle  to  grave,  secure  lifecycle  management  of  information,  end-to- end.   Privacy  by  Design  seeks  to  assure  all  stakeholders  that  whatever  the   business  practice  or  technology  involved,  it  is  in  fact,  operating   according  to  the  stated  promises  and  objectives,  subject  to   independent  verification.  Its  component  parts  and  operations  remain   visible  and  transparent,  to  both  users  and  providers  alike.  Remember,   trust  but  verify.   Above  all,  Privacy  by  Design  requires  architects  and  operators  to  keep   the  interests  of  the  individual  uppermost  by  offering  such  measures  as   strong  privacy  defaults,  appropriate  notice,  and  empowering  user- friendly  options.  Keep  it  user-centric.

Appendix  B  ­  The  Tips  for  Communicating  Privacy  Practices  to  The  Apps'   Users,  as  Suggested  by  the  Office  of  the  Privacy  Commissioner  of  Canada    
   Recommendation/Step   Be  Transparent.   The  user  can  find  out  about  what  information  an   app  collects  from  them  from  various  sources   such  as  media,  academic  research  or  publication,   analysis  by  a  third  party  or  anyone  else.  To   generate  users'  trust,  the  app  developers  should   ensure  that  users  find  out  about  privacy   information  from  developers  and  not  by  accident   from  some  other  third  party.     2   Be  specific.   Generic  and  overly  broad  information  makes  it   harder  for  users  to  give  their  meaningful   consent,  which  is  why  app  developers  have  to  be   very  specific  in  their  privacy  communication.     If  there  are  any  changes  in  the  privacy  policy,  the   users  should  be  notified.   3   Speak  to  your  audience.   The  app  providers  should  know  their  users  and   communicate  in  the  accessible  and   comprehensive  way  with  their  users.  They   should  use  the  language  that  their  audience  can   understand.   4   Tailor  to  the  environment.   Developers  of  mobile  apps  should  cater  for  small   screens  and  make  the  privacy  information   accessible  for  the  mobile  devices.   Explain  the  data  you  are  requesting  and  collecting.   5   Describe  how  your  app  uses  the   permissions  it  seeks.   It  is  insufficient  to  inform  the  users  what   permission  the  app  would  ask  from  them.  The   users  should  be  informed  why  the  users  should   grant  those  permissions.   Many  applications  ask  or  require  users  to  log  in   or  register  using  social  media  accounts.  It  should   be  explain  what  information  is  collected  through   these  accounts.     "Absent  additional  information,  the  fact  that  a   user  has  been  notified  of  the  app's  ability  to   access  certain  personal  information  would  not   1   Make  sure  privacy  information   comes  from  you.   Explanation

Appendix  E  ­  Consent  Form  for  the  Participation  in  the  Study  
   Dear  respondent,   Before  you  give  your  consent,  please  read  the  following  information  about  your   involvement.      You  are  being  asked  to  voluntarily  participate  in  a  research  study.  This  research  study  is   being  conducted  by  Daria  Ilkina,  a  MMSc  Candidate  from  Ted  Rogers  School  of   Management  at  Ryerson  University.      This  survey  is  designed  to  learn  about  your  opinions  and/or  experience  using  mobile   learning  (m-learning)  apps.  In  this  questionnaire,  m-learning  app  is  an  application  that   offers  course  materials  and  facilitates  learning  on  mobile/handheld  devices.  For   example,  apps  like  iTunes  University,  Blackboard  Mobile,  Algebra  Tutor,  Lumosity,   Rosetta  Course,  TripLingo,  etc.  are  m-learning  apps.      The  results  from  this  study  will  provide  new  insights  for  the  m-learning  app  developers   and  designers  on  what  are  the  user  concerns,  what  is  important  for  potential  and   current  users  of  m-learning  applications.      All  individual  responses  will  remain  anonymous  and  confidential.  The  data  may  be  used   in  scholarly  and  professional  publications  or  conference  presentations.  The  data   collected  through  this  survey  will  be  stored  securely  on  the  researcher's  computer,  and   then  destroyed  in  a  year  after  the  research  completion.        120     

         While  the  survey  is  online,  the  data  will  be  hosted  on  Canadian  servers.  However,  there   is  a  small  chance  that  data  submitted  through  the  site  may  be  routed  through  other   localities  and  so  we  cannot  guarantee  absolute  confidentiality  of  data,  though  the  data   will  still  be  anonymized.      You  should  expect  to  be  able  to  complete  this  questionnaire  in  10  minutes.  There're   minimum  risks  associated  with  the  participation  in  this  study.  At  most,  you  may  feel   fatigued  or  slightly  inconvenienced  after  taking  this  survey.  Should  you  feel   uncomfortable  answering  any  of  the  questions  presented  in  this  survey,  you  may  stop   your  participation  at  any  time  by  closing  your  web  browser  to  exit  the  survey,   effectively  withdrawing  your  consent  to  participate.  The  information  that  you  provided   prior  to  the  withdrawal  of  your  consent  will  not  be  collected  in  case  you  choose  to   discontinue  your  participation  in  this  study.        You  should  be  18  or  older  to  participate  in  this  study.      If  you  have  any  questions  or  comments  about  your  participation,  please  contact  the   researcher  who  is  conducting  this  study,  Daria  Ilkina:  daria.ilkina@ryerson.ca.      You  can  also  contact  Daria  Ilkina's  supervisor,  Dr.  Avner  Levin,  via  this  email:   avner.levin@ryerson.ca.      This  study  has  been  reviewed  by  the  Ryerson  University  Research  Ethics  Board.  If  you   have  questions  regarding  your  rights  as  a  participant  in  this  study  please  contact:

         the  purposes  of  this  research,  I  considered  only  applications  that  offer  course  materials   for  m-learning.   Mobile  application:  An  application  software  designed  to  run  on  mobile  devices.   Mobile  device:  In  the  context  of  this  study,  mobile  devices  are  all  portable  handheld   computing  devices  such  as  smartphones,  mobile  feature  phones,  tablets  or  any  other   personal  digital  assistants  (PDAs).   Non-personally  identifiable  information  (Non-PII):  Any  information  about  an   individual  that  cannot  be  directly  linked  to  him/her,  i.e.,  cannot  be  used  to  identify  a   person.   Personally  identifiable  information  (PII):  Any  information  that  may  be  used  to   identify  an  individual.   Privacy  by  Design  (PbD):  Privacy  by  Design  is  a  concept  developed  by  Ann  Cavoukian   in  the  1990s  to  address  growing  and  systemic  effects  of  the  ICTs  and  the  large-scale   networked  data  systems.  According  to  PbD  principles,  privacy  protection  cannot  rely   solely  on  regulations  and  public  policies,  but  the  privacy  assurance  must  become  an   organization's  default  mode  of  operation.   VPN  or  Virtual  Private  Network:  A  private  network  that  uses  another  public  network   (usually  the  internet)  to  connect  multiple  users.  Enables  users  to  connect  to  the  private   network  from  a  public  network  without  sacrificing  security  concerns.   Web  Beacons  (also  called  web  bugs  and  clear  GIFs):  used  in  combination  with  cookies   to  help  people  running  websites  to  understand  the  behaviour  of  their  customers.  A  web   beacon  is  typically  a  transparent  graphic  image  (usually  1  pixel  x  1  pixel)  that  is  placed   on  a  site  or  in  an  email.  (Source:  AllAboutCookies.org,  2014.)
