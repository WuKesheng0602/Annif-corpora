STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOUR OF ULTRA HIGH PERFROMANCE FIBRE REINFORCED CONCRETE COMPOSITE MEMBERS

Luaay Hussein PhD, Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University, 2015

Abstract
The aging and deterioration of reinforced concrete infrastructures in North America present major technical and economical challenges to infrastructure owners. To effectively address some of the challenges, there is a need to develop innovative and cost-effective systems. The main objective of this research was to develop composite members of ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete and normal strength concrete or high strength concrete (UHPFRCNSC/HSC). In order to achieve this objective, the first phase of this research investigates the structural behaviour of UHPFRC with varying fibre content beams without web reinforcement. Test results indicated that the addition of 1% of steel fibres effectively improves the shear strength of UHPC beams by 77% due to the crack-bridging stress that develops across the crack surface. In the second phase, experimental studies were carried out on UHPFRC-NSC/HSC prisms and beams without stirrups to investigate the flexural and shear capacity of those composite members. Each beam specimen was designed to have the UHPFRC layer in tension and the NSC/HSC layer in compression. Additional varied parameters included fibre volume content, and shear connectors were investigated. Test results showed that the performance of the proposed composite system in terms of the flexural and shear capacity was successfully enhanced. All composite beams failed in shear at a force that is 1.6 to 2.0 times higher than that of the NSC/HSC beam's resistance. Test results showed that the effect of using HSC versus NSC in the composite beam was negligible, and the bond strength between the two concrete material layers (UHPFRC and NSC/HSC) was significantly high that the addition of shear connectors was unnecessary. In the third phase, an analytical and finite element models to predict the ultimate shear capacity of UHPFRC composite beams were proposed and validated with the experimental results. The results of the finite element analysis showed that the size effect in structures made of UHPFRC material has little influence on the shear capacity. Finally a comparison between the finite element model and the analytical model indicated that both

models developed in this research are capable of predicting the shear behaviour of UHPFRC and UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams.

Introduction

1.1 Introduction
The aging and deterioration of highway bridge structures in North America present major technical and economic challenges to bridge owners regarding when and how to upgrade these damaged structures and extend their service lives at the minimum life cycle cost. These problems are further compounded by the budgetary constraints that face most highway agencies. Highway bridge girders are approaching the end of their service life and some of them present serious structural deficiencies due to the effects of corrosion, overload, inadequate original design, poor construction, and lack of reliable inspection and effective maintenance. To effectively address some of the above challenges, there is a need to develop effective management tools as well as innovative and cost-effective materials, construction techniques and structural systems to build the next generation of high-performance bridges.

Ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) represents a major step forward when compared to conventional normal strength concrete (NSC) and high strength concrete (HSC), due to the achievement of very high strength and very low permeability. The UHPC is a concrete with a compressive strength above 150 MPa, pre-and post-cracking tensile strengths above 5 MPa, and has enhanced durability via its discontinuous pore structure (Graybeal, 2005). This "ultra" high strength is achieved through different techniques such as the use of improved materials, ultra-fine pozzolans (e.g. silica fume), low water-cement ratio, improved quality and higher dosage of superplasticizer, use of fibres (metallic or synthetic) to increase energy absorption capacity and decrease brittleness, high cementitious material content, longer mixing time and heat treatment (Rahman et al., 2005). UHPFRC tensile strength varies from 10 to 30 MPa, and the modulus of elasticity varies between 60 and 100 GPa (Buitelaar et al., 2004). Using UHPFRC in the construction of new bridges and in the renewal of existing highway bridge networks could minimize maintenance requirements in the construction of new long lasting
1

bridges and result in lower life cycle costs (Almansour and Lounis, 2010). UHPC's initial construction cost is significantly higher than that of normal strength concrete (NSC), which has limited its use in North America and elsewhere. The structural efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using UHPFRC in composite construction is investigated in this study, to address some of the challenges faced by bridge owners. Therefore, to strengthen the bridge zones that are most exposed to severe environmental deterioration and high mechanical loading, a system combining NSC/HSC with UHPFRC in a composite construction is intended to optimize the use of the properties of both materials. In this composite construction, UHPFRC was used in the parts of the structure that require high mechanical loading and/or low permeability to detrimental substances, whereas, the other parts were made using NSC/HSC. The proposed system of composite "UHPFRC-NSC/HSC" structures can be used for the effective construction of new structures and the rehabilitation of existing structures. Such a composite system will enable structures (e.g. bridges) with longer service lives, longer spans, lighter weights, and lower maintenance costs over their life cycle.

1.2 Objectives and Scope of the research
1.2.1 Objectives The commonly used design codes in North America, ACI-318-11 and CSA A23.3-04 and in Europe EN 1992-1-1:2004 could not predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams with a compressive strength exceeding 150 MPa (22 ksi). In addition, the experimental studies of the shear characteristic for UHPFRC beams are extremely limited. Thus, the primary objectives of this research are: 1. Investigate the performance and structural behaviour of new composite UHPFRC-NSC, and UHPFRC-HSC members subjected to shear and bending. 2. Develop an analytical model to predict the shear strength of new composite elements UHPFRC-NSC, and UHPFRC-HSC beams. 3. Develop a finite element model to predict the shear strength of new composite elements UHPFRC-NSC, and UHPFRC-HSC beams.

In order to understand shear behaviour of composite UHPFRC-NSC, and UHPFRC-HSC members, the following objectives were investigated: 4. Investigate the shear behaviour of ultra-high performance concrete UHPC beams without web reinforcement, and ultra-high performance steel fibre reinforced concrete UHPFRC without web reinforcement. 5. Investigate the concrete contribution to shear strength, and the contribution of steel fibres to shear strength of UHPC beams and UHPFRC beams without web reinforcement. 6. Investigate the shear failure mechanism, and the ultimate shear strength of UHPFRC beams. 7. Develop an analytical model to predict the shear strength of UHPFRC beams. 8. Develop an analytical model to predict the flexural strength of UHPFRC beams.

1.2.2 Scope This investigation was limited to simply supported beams subjected to concentrate monotonic loading. Other loading schemes such as cyclic, reversed cyclic and dynamic loading, which are substantially different than monotonic loading were not investigated. This research is also limited to concrete compressive strength between 150 and 200 MPa, without and with straight steel fibres. However, the results of this investigation can be applicable to FRC beams constructed with other deformed steel fibres that exhibit bond stress versus slip response similar to that of straight steel fibres used in this investigation.

Chapter 2 Literature Review

This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the various topics that were studied in this thesis. The literature review begins with the concept of using UHPFRC as a structural material and will summarize some of the mechanical properties. Section 2.1 describes the characteristic of UHPFRC material. Section 2.2 summarizes some of the methods that can be used to predict the shear behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete beams and presents a summary of some of the past research that has focussed on the use of steel fibres in Reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Section 2.3 introduces the concept of composite concrete members and summarizes the past research that has focussed on composite concrete members.

2.1 UHPFRC
2.1.1 Historical overview The term ultra-high performance concrete was first used in a publication by de Larrard and Sedran (1994). Although no precise definition could be found in the reviewed technical literature to ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), UHPC is defined as the concrete or cementitious composites with compressive strength over 150 MPa (22 ksi) and with water to cementitious ratio (w/c) less than 0.2 (Wille and Naaman, 2012). When steel fibres are added to UHPC to increase the energy absorption capacity and decrease brittleness, the term ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is used.

UHPFRC development found its origin in early 1970s, Yudenfreund et al. (1972) investigated high strength pastes with low w/c ratios (w/c = 0.2 to 0.3). They achieved 230 MPa by using vacuum mixing process to reduce the porosity of the cement paste. Hot temperature and pressure technique was first applied by Roy et al. (1972), and resulted in high strength cement pastes with compressive strengths up to 680 MPa. With the development of superplasticizers and pozzolanic
5

admixtures such as silica fume, Birchall et al. (1981) developed polymer modified cementitious materials called Macro-Defect-Free (MDF) cements, and Bache (1987) developed the densified small particles (DSP) which use the interaction of superplasticizers and silica fume to decrease the porosity of the material and to increase the strengths. This led to compressive strengths between 120 and 250 MPa. This matrix was theoretically investigated and optimized by DeLarrard and Sedran (1994). Richard and Cheyrezy (1995) introduced reactive powder concrete (RPC) and reported compressive strengths up to 800 MPa using a temperature of up to 400C, pressure of 50 MPa, 10% volume content of steel fibres, and steel aggregates. However, these high strength cement pastes and mortars are very brittle. Consequently, the addition of fibres is necessary to enhance ductility. Compact reinforced composite (CRC) was developed by Aalborg Portland (1986) in Denmark. This type of UHPC contains 5 to 10% of steel fibres (6 mm length and 0.15 mm of diameter) to improve the tensile strength of the material without improving the ductility of a structure (Bache, 1987). Reactive powder concrete (RPC) was further developed by Bouygues, France in 1995 which contains maximum 2.5% of steel fibres by volume (13 mm length and 0.16 mm of diameter) (Richard and Cheyrezy 1995, Orange et al. 2000). The length of the fibre in RPC is twice longer than CRC. This low fibre content of RPC doesn't increase the tensile strength of the matrix, which is around 8 MPa; however, the bond between fibres and the matrix was found to be improved compared to CRC. The multi-scale cement composite (MSCC) using a mixture of short and long steel fibres were developed at the LCPC in France and are known under the name CEMTECmultiscal Â® (Rossi 1997, Rossi, 2002)

2.1.2 UHPFRC composition UHPFRC consists of cement, silica fume, fine sand, fibres, water and superplasticizer. Typical water/cement ratio is 0.15-0.20. Cement: The cement content is very high, more than two times higher than that of the normal strength concrete  700kg / m3 . The cement used in UHPFRC usually has low alkali content, low to medium fineness and low C3A-content, thus, reducing water need, ettringite formation and heat of hydration. The homogeneity of the mix was improved by eliminating the coarse aggregate, and optimizing the packing density. Some researchers used quartz powder of 25% of cement content as a filler to optimize the packing density (Wille and Naaman, 2012).
6

Silica fume: Silica fume is used in UHPFRC to fill the voids between cement grains. It improves rheological properties, and it forms hydration products. Silica fume of 25% of cement content is found to be the optimum filling capacity (Wille and Naaman, 2012). However, the use of silica fume increases the shrinkage of the mix to be more than that of the conventional concrete with similar water to binder ratio (Loukili, 1999). Sand: Sand with a mean particle size smaller than 1 mm is used to produce UHPFRC mix. Quartz sand is more suitable for UHPFRC due to its high hardness property and its good interface with the cement paste. Superplasticizer: Superplasticizers are essential to ensure a good workability of UHPFRC. They improve rheology of the fresh material and reduce the need for water. Polycarboxylates and polycarboxylatethers are very efficient superplasticizers . Fibres: UHPC is a brittle material; therefore, fibres with different geometries and lengths are added to UHPC to increase the energy absorption capacity and decrease brittleness. Steel fibres are mostly adapted due its high strength and stiffness. Steel and organic fibres are used in UHPFRC. Steel fibres in UHPFRC are generally pulled out; therefore, fibre ductility is less important than it strength. Naaman (2008) developed curves for strain hardening under bending and uniaxial tension as a function of the fibre properties. Rossi (2002) developed UHPFRC on the basis of the multiscale concept with several kinds of steel fibres to increase the tensile strength of the material and the deformation capacity of the structure.

2.1.3 Structural applications Application of UHPC has been used internationally in the construction of a limited number of bridges in Canada, the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The first application for a footbridge was realized with a use of RPC, in Sherbrooke, Canada in 1997 (Fig. 2.1(a)). It is 60 m long and 3.3 m wide post-tensioned truss with 30 mm thick slab. Deck and truss members are made from UHPFRC, no passive reinforcement was used. Amongst this type of the UHPC applications are Seonyu footbridge in Seoul, South Korea (Fig. 2.1(b)); the Sakata Maria footbridge in Sakata city, Japan (Fig. 2.1(c)); the Yokemuri footbridge in Yagamata, Japan; and

7

the Papatoetoe and Penrose footbridges in Auckland, New Zealand (Ahlborn et al., 2008, Suleiman et al., 2008, Schmidt and Fehling, 2004, Buitelaar, 2004)

The first UHPC highway bridge was opened to traffic in France in 2001 (Hajar et al. 2004), and at the same time, another UHPC bridge was constructed in Italy with 11.8 m span. (Meda and Rosati, 2003). In late 2005, a 33.8 m span UHPC bridge was designed and opened to traffic in Iowa (Bierwagen and Abu-Hawash, 2005).

Other application of UHPC include piles lining in oil production platform in the lake of Maracaibo in Venezuela in 1992 and 1993 (Buitelaar, 2004), as a rehabilitation material in the Kinzua Dam Stilling Basin in 1983 (Buitelaar, 2004), and as an architectural shape in tollgate of Millau Viaduct in France (Fig. 2.1(d)) (Schmidt and Fehling, 2004).

2.1.4 Effect of fibres on concrete properties The incorporation of steel fibres in the mix design overcomes the brittle behaviour of plain UHPC under tensile loading, and significantly improves its post-cracking tensile resistance and toughness. The performance of UHPFRC depends greatly on the bond between steel fibres and concrete, fibres distribution in the concrete matrix, and the fibre content. The primary role of steel fibres is bridging the cracks. As cracks open, the fibres can either fracture or pull out from the concrete depending on the bond strength between the fibres and the concrete. Pull out failure is more often due to the amount of energy absorbed in the concrete matrix. Therefore, improving the bond characteristic between the steel fibres and concrete is desirable to increase the bridging affect.

Figure 2.1 Applications of UHPFRC

Different types of fibres were used in the concrete industry; the common types are shown in Figures 2.2 and 2.3. Straight fibre was the first type of steel fibres used in concrete and its bond strength depends on the friction between the fibre and the concrete. Therefore, higher surface area to volume ratio of fibres has high bond strength. Also, the bond strength depends on the aspect ratio, which is the length of fibre to diameter ratio. The deformation of fibres significantly improves the bond strength between fibres and concrete. However, increasing fibre aspect ratio, introducing mechanical anchorage, and changing fibre cross section may decrease the bond strength due to inadequate workability and fibre distribution (ACI Committee 544, 1988).

Figure 2.2 Different types of steel fibres grouped according to their bond characteristics (Wille and Naaman, 2012b)

Figure 2.3 Different types of steel fibres (Wille and Naaman, 2012b) 10

The fibre matrix bond mechanism depends on physico-chemical bond that is based on the adhesive and frictional forces, and mechanical bond due to fibre deformation (Wille and Naaman, 2012a). Fig. 2.4 shows comparison between smooth fibres and deformed fibres, such as end hooked or twisted fibres. It can be noted from Fig. 2.4 that mechanical contribution of deformed fibres increases the bond component, which leads to the increase in the pull out resistance. The mechanical bond properties are affected by the geometric deformation of the fibre and the matrix tensile stress resistance. The deformation along fibre length provide a mechanical bond contribution along the fibre such as in crimped, indented or polygonal twisted fibres whereas the deformation at the fibre end increases the mechanical bond such as paddles, buttons or hooks fibres.

Chan and Chu (2004), Markovic (2006), and Stengel (2009) studied the behaviour of steel fibres embedded in UHPC. Wille and Naaman (2012b) developed Fig. 2.5 to illustrate fibre tensile stress-slip behaviour of straight (S), hooked-end (H), and twisted (T) fibres based on pullout tests of fibres embedded in high-strength cementitious matrix by Sujiravorakul (2001), Kim et al. (2008), Naaman and Najm (1991), Robins et al. (2002), and Cunha et al. (2010).

It can be noted from Fig. 2.5 that the pullout response of one single S-fibre is characterized by a rapid increase of fibre stress followed by a decrease of tensile stress with an increase of pullout slip due to fibre debonding. The bond strength between S-fibre surface and the matrix is predominantly controlled by the physicochemical bond properties; while in hooked-end fibre, the pullout induces pressure on the cement matrix at the end of the hook which increases the frictional force and thus increases the pullout resistance. However, this mechanical contribution decreases with an increase in slip due to straighten of the end hook. For Polygonal-shaped Tfibres, the mechanical contribution along the fibre length provided by the un-twist torque resistance increases the pressure on the cement matrix along the fibre length and thus increases the pullout resistance and the amount of dissipated energy up to very high slips.

12

The average pullout load-versus-slip curves of the S-, H-, and T-fibres are shown in Fig. 2.6(a). Fig. 2.6(b) shows the mechanical bond contribution of the deformed fibres in comparison to Sfibres. It can be noted from Fig. 2.6(b) that the maximum fibre stress for the pulled-out deformed fibres (T1 and T2) is approximately three times the stress achieved by the S-fibres. The material use factor which is defined as the maximum tensile stress achieved through pullout divided by the material tensile strength was between 0.9 and 1.0 for deformed fibres which is more than twice the value of 0.44 for the S-fibre.

Figure 2.6 Effect of fibre geometry on pullout behaviour of steel fibres embedded in UHPC-A (Wille and Naaman, 2012b)

Banthia and Trottier (1994) studied the effect of inclination angle with respect to loading direction for hooked steel fibre in normal, mid and high strength concrete. They found that the load-slip curve was not significantly affected by changing the inclination angle that ranged between 0 and 15 degrees, while at an angle higher than 30 degrees, the effect of fibre inclination was more pronounced up to a slip of 3.5 mm as shown in Fig. 2.7.

13

Figure 2.7 Effect of fibre inclination for hooked steel fibre in high strength concrete (Banthia and Trottier, 1994)

According to Hannant (1978), the fibre composite tensile strength,  cc , and elastic modulus, Ec , are:

 cc   f *Vsf   mu (1  Vsf )

(2.1)

Ec  E f *Vsf  Em (1  Vsf )

(2.2)

where,  f = fibre tensile strength,

 mu = matrix tensile strength at first crack
E f = fibre modulus,

E m = matrix modulus, and
Vsf = fibre volume content

To account for fibre length factor, 1 , and fibre orientation factor,  , the composite tensile strength,  cc , and elastic modulus, Ec , can be calculated as follows:

 cc  1 f *Vsf   mu (1  Vsf )
Ec  1E f *Vsf  Em (1  Vsf )

(2.3) (2.4)

Allen (1972) proposed a fibre length factor takes into consideration the ability to develop the bond along the fibres as follows:

 lf  ifl f  l c  2l 1   c 1  l f ifl  l c  2l c f 

(2.5)

Where, l f is the fibre length and l c is the two times the length of the fibre embedment length required to induce fibre fracture as opposed to fibre pullout. The fibre embedment length can vary between l f / 2 and 0. If pullout occurs from the side with the smaller embedment length, the average effective embedment length is l f / 4 (Narayanan and Darwish, 1987, Aoude, 2007); therefore the factor 1 = 0.5. The fibre orientation factor  for one, two and three dimensional fibre orientations is 1, 2 /  , and 0.5 respectively (Naaman, 2008).

The "effective" number of fibres per unit area, n fib , can be calculated using equation (2.6) for fibres randomly oriented in three dimensions (Hannant, 1978):
n fib  Vsf Asf *  * 1

(2.6)

where, Asf is the cross-sectional area of the fibre.
15

The post-cracking tensile strength,  pc , can be calculated on the basis of the average bond strength, the number of fibres per unit area, and the effective bond length (Naaman and Reinhardt, 1995):

 pc  12 3Vsf

lf df

(2.7)

 where, 1 , 2 , and 3 are the effective bond length, fibre orientation factor and group factor
associated with number of factors crossing a unit area for post-cracking state, d f is the diameter of the fibre, and



is bond between the fibre and the matrix

The critical fibre volume content can be defined as the volume content where the composite can carry additional stress after the matrix cracked (  pc   cc ) as shown in Fig. 2.8. Naaman and Reinhardt (1995) derived an expression for critical fibre volume content taking into account the fibre distribution and the bond between the fibre and the matrix as follows:

V fc 

1

 lf 1 (     1  2 )  mu d f 1 2 3

(2.8)

where,  1 and  2 are fibre length and fibre orientation factor for uncracked composite. For hooked steel fibres, Naaman and Reinhardt predicted a volume content factor of 2%.

2.1.5 Material properties 2.1.5.1 Compressive strength Several authors reported that the effect of fibres on the compressive strength was not significantly increased (Minelli, 2005, Dupont, 2003, Nataraja et al., 1999). Tomas and Ramaswamy (2007) reported that the increase in the peak compressive strength was less than 10% when fibres with 1.5% volume content was added to the concrete. However, the addition of fibres significantly reduced the rate of strength loss after the peak stress. Johnston (2001) showed that lateral swelling of the concrete takes place during the uniaxial compressive test resulting in a combination of shear and tensile stresses in the concrete section due to the improved postcracking resistance of the steel fibre reinforced concrete. Several investigators have proposed models for the characterization of the compressive stress-strain behaviour of SFRC (Nataraja et al., 1999, Mansur et al., 1999).

Graybeal and Davis (2008) investigated the relationship between the measured compressive strength of cylinder specimens and cube specimens of UHPFRC in the strengths that ranged from 80 to 200 MPa. They found the followings: 1. A factor of 0.96 should be applied to convert the 70.7 mm (2.78 in.) cube strength result into an equivalent 76 mm (3 in.) diameter cylinder result
17

2. The 102 mm (4 in.) diameter cylinders, 76 mm (3 in.) diameter cylinders, and 100 mm (4 in.) cubes are acceptable and interchangeable test specimens for the determination of the compressive strength of UHPFRC

2.1.5.2 Tensile strength It is difficult to experimentally evaluate the direct tensile behaviour of steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC). The problem arises from the need for specimens that have sufficiently large cross section area such that the fibre distribution will be similar to that in real structural members. Therefore, this size of specimen often poses difficulty in the design of fixtures to grip the end of the specimen. The average strain is hard to interpret because after cracking the average strain is due to local crack opening. In addition, the length of the strain gauge affects the average strain. Recent research by Graybeal and Baby (2013) presented a direct tension test method applicable to UHPC based on a concept of a standard tension test applied to metals. They investigated different fibre percentage contents and curing conditions of UHPC. The results showed that the uniaxial tensile strength of UHPFRC was higher than 9 MPa.

Usually, the concrete tensile strength is obtained from indirect tests due to the difficulties to achieve truly axial tension without secondary stresses induced by the holding devices in the direct tension test as shown in Fig. 2.9(a). Indirect tests such as the bending or modulus of rupture test, Fig. 2.9(b), the double punch test, Fig. 2.9(c), or the split cylinder test, Fig. 2.9(d). While indirect tests are easier to perform, they require assumptions about the state of stress within the specimen in order to determine the tensile strength from the measured failure load.

Shah (1978) performed direct tensile test with straight, hooked and standard steel fibres as shown in Fig. 2.10 (ACI Committee 544, 1988)

Figure 2.10 Direct tensile stress-strain curves for different types of SFRC (ACI Committee 544, 1988)

Noghabai (2000) studied the tensile characteristics of the concrete by testing notched concrete cylinder specimen under uniaxial tension loads. The advantage of this test method is it 's applicability to any type of concrete, regardless of type of fibre used taking into account fibre orientation. However, when larger fibres are used, the small cross section of the specimen may not represent the material adequately. Noghabai (2000) found that the use of high strength concrete increases both the first crack and the post-cracking tensile strength of SFRC (Fig. 2.11).

As mentioned earlier, incorporating steel fibres will increase the fracture energy, ductility, compressive and tensile strength while the cracking reducing tendency of the concrete matrix. In general, UHPFRC mixture tensile behaviour has three main stages as shown in Fig. 2.12 (Spasojevic, 2008): 1. Linear-elastic response stage Â­ The response of the UHPFRC concrete under increasing strain is essentially linear-elastic until the applied load induces a stress level in the UHPFRC mixture that matches the concrete tensile strength and a first microcrack appears. 2. Pseudo strain hardening stage Â­ This stage is also referred to as "pseudo plastic" because there is no real plastic microstructural changes occur. In fact, deformations continue to increase strongly as a result of formation of the several microcracks (Spasojevic, 2008), while the uniaxial tensile stress does not change considerably, or increases considerably slower compared to the linear-elastic stage. The development of multiple microcracking with uniformly distributed openings secured together by the fibres within the UHPFRC is similar to strain hardening or plastic deformation.

20

3. Strain softening stage Â­ This stage occurs at the onset of any of the UHPFRC mixture sections fails to transfer the average stress of the same intensity, resulting in reaching the strain hardening capacity of UHPFRC mixture. Then the formation of macrocracks occurs and will start opening further until eventually reach the deformation capacity, normally addressed as half the length of the longest fibre (Spasojevic, 2008).

Figure 2.12 Â­ Response of UHPFRC in uniaxial tensile stress state compared to conventional (CC), fibre- reinforced normal or high-strength concrete (FRC, HSFRC), as well as engineered cementitious composites (ECC) with short polymeric (PE, PVA) fibres (adapted from Spasojevi, 2008)

Similarly, Wille and Naaman, (2011) studied the tensile behaviour of the UHPFRC, Fig. 2.13 illustrates a simplified response of strain-hardening FRC composites in tension where stress is defined as the obtained tensile load, when the first percolation crack occurs, divided by the specimen cross sectional area, and the maximum post-cracking stress is defined as the maximum tensile load divided by the specimen cross sectional area. The elastic behaviour (Part I) up to 90Â­ 95% of cracking strength followed by development of micro cracks and activation of fibres; the

strain hardening behaviour when, multiple cracks will form with small crack width and inelastic strain (Part II); and the strain softening behaviour (Part III).

Figure 2.13 Idealized simplified response of strain-hardening FRC composites in tension (Wille et al., 2011)

Increasing the fibre volume content within a certain range increases the tensile strength as well as the tensile strain at peak stress as shown in Fig. 2.14. Naaman and Wille (2010) recommended a fibre factor in order to preserve a suitable workability of UHPFRC without fibre clumping.

Figure 2.14 Influence of fibre volume fraction on tensile behaviour. (a) Smooth (S) fibres and (b) twisted (T) fibres (Wille et al., 2011) 22

Naaman (2008) introduced the utilization factor to evaluate the utilization of the fibre material. The utilization factor,  u , is defined as the ratio of maximum post-cracking stress to the ultimate tensile strength of the composite, assuming all fibres fail simultaneously.

The ultimate tensile strength of the composite  cu can be obtained from equation (2.10)

where,  = orientation factor,  fu = the ultimate tensile strength of fibre. The maximum postcracking stress  pc can be obtained from equation (2.11)

The value of maximum post-cracking stress  pc can be obtained from direct tensile test. Naaman (2008) also suggested equation (2.12) for calculating the first cracking strength of the composite (  cc ):

Wille et al. (2011) improved the strain hardening capacity from 0.3 to 0.6% of UHPFRC composites. They used different types of steel fibres as shown in Fig. 2.3. The test results are shown in Fig. 2.14. They evaluated the utilization of fibre material,  u , using equations (2.9) and (2.10), and was in the range of 28 to 51%. This range concluded that it's possible for a further improvement in the bond behaviour in order to increase the fibre utilization which leads to a higher tensile strength for a given fibre volume content. The average tensile stress of the fibres,  fpc within the composite at peak strength  pc was calculated from equation (2.13), which was derived from equation (2.10).

 fpc 

 pc Vsf

(2.13)

By assuming   0.75 , the maximum average fibre tensile stress  fpc within different UHPFRC is shown in Fig. 2.15. It can be noted from Fig. 2.15 that the fibre tensile stress  fpc of straight fibres is not significantly affected by the different fibre volume content, while the  fpc of hooked fibres is significantly affected by the fibre volume content. They attributed that to the group effect which was affected by the localized mechanical bond anchorage at the end of the hook that leads to peak stress concentrations in the matrix causing micro cracks which in turn reduce the proportional increase in the tensile strength when fibre volume content was increased. While for the twisted fibres, the fibre tensile stress  fpc was not significantly affected by the fibre volume content due to the distribution of mechanical bond over the entire length of the fibre.

24

Figure 2.15 Average fibre tensile stress  fpc within the composite at peak strength  pc (Wille et al., 2011)

The parameter  was estimated using equations (2.10) and (2.11), and by obtaining the tensile strength  pc from the tensile test results, and the equivalent bond strength  was obtained from tests on single fibre pull out as follows:



Pmax d f ( Le  S p )

(2.14)

where, Pmax is the maximum pull out load, Le the embedment length, and S p slip at Pmax . Wille et al. (2011) found out the value of  for straight fibres is 0.95, and for deformed fibres is 0.24 which represent the group effect of fibres in the composite by considering constant fibre orientation, and neglecting the spalling effect. These results show a significant difference between straight fibres and deformed fibres. They attributed the low values of  for deformed bars to the strong mechanical bond that causes high stress concentration and damages the matrix
25

locally, and the smaller crack spacing less than fibre length that reduces the mean embedment length, leading to a decrease in pull out resistance

ACI Committee 544 (1988) commented that the first-crack flexural strength and the peak postcracking flexural strength should be reported from the flexural test which can be calculated by assuming linear stress distribution.

Wafa and Ashour (1992) found that 1.5% volume content of fibres with an aspect ratio of 80 increased the first-crack flexural strength by 67%. Tomas and Ramaswamy (2007) found that adding 0.5 to 1.5% by volume of hooked steel fibres with an aspect ratio of 60 increased the first-crack flexural strength by 40%.

Wille et al. (2011) performed bending tests on UHPFRC to confirm the effectiveness of fibre geometry observed in the direct tensile tests as shown in Fig. 2.16. They noted that the ratio of equivalent bending strength to direct tensile strength ranged between 2.4 and 2.65.

The effect of specimen size on the flexural and axial tensile strengths was investigated by Reineck and Frettlohr (Reineck and Frettlohr, 2010). The results show that strength decreased with increasing size of test specimens

Wille and Parra-Montesinos (2012) investigated the effects of beam size, casting method, and support conditions on UHPC flexure test results. The results show that large discrepancies in equivalent bending strengths using the same UHPFRC mixture design, depending on the test setup and specimen characteristics. They noted that that the equivalent bending strengths was ranged between 10 MPa and 29 MPa depend on various casting methods, and support conditions.

2.1.5.3 Modulus of elasticity Graybeal (2005) measured the modulus of elasticity of UHPFRC material by testing compression cylinders according to the ASTM C469 test method. The results from these tests show that the modulus of elasticity for air treated cylinders was 42.7 GPa. The results show that the specimens continued to gain strength for at least 8 weeks after casting. Graybeal also measured the modulus of elasticity using direct tension tests. The average measured value was 47.6 GPa.

2.2 Shear behaviour of reinforced concrete beams
2.2.1 Shear stresses distribution and failure of plain concrete beams For simply supported rectangular beams with no stirrups and no longitudinal reinforcement subjected to a concentrated load at mid span as shown in Fig. 2.17, the normal and shear stresses for x  a are determined from beam theory as follows:
27

f ( x, y )  

My 12Vxy  I bh 3

(2.15)

VQ 6V h 2 v( y )   3 (  y2 ) Ib bh 4

(2.16)

where, V = Shear force on the cross section M = Moment on the cross section I = moment of inertia of the cross section Q = first moment about the centroidal axis of the part of the cross-sectional area lying farther from the centroidal axis than the point where the shear stresses are being calculated b = width of the member at the section where the stresses are being calculated h = height of the member at the section where the stresses are being calculated

As shown in Fig. 2.17 which illustrates the normal and shear distribution of stresses at the top and bottom surfaces, the shear stress is zero and the beam is subjected to a pure tension or compression stress state, while at the mid-depth level of the beam, the shear stress is maximum, which is determined as follows:

vmax ( y  0) 

3V 2bh

(2.17)

The shear stress in equation (2.17) is pure shear stress, leads to principal tension and compression stresses with the same magnitude. When the principal tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of concrete, crack forms at the mid-depth level of the beam usually perpendicular to the direction of the principal tensile stress know as diagonal tension cracks. For plain concrete,

28

flexural cracking will likely precede diagonal cracking leading to immediate collapse of the beam.

Figure 2.17 Plain concrete beam subjected to a concentrated load

2.2.2 Shear in reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement 2.2.2.1 Inclined cracking pattern and modes of shear failure When longitudinal reinforcement is added to the beam, flexural cracks form due to the ability of longitudinal reinforcement to bridge cracks and transfer stresses to concrete by bond action. Reinforced concrete beams without stirrups may fail in shear. Two different modes of shear cracks were specified by Winter and Nilson (1979): web-shear cracks and flexure shear cracks as shown in Fig. 2.18. When the flexural stresses are small at the particular location, the diagonal tension stresses are inclined at an angle about 45 0 and equal in magnitude to the shear stress with a maximum at the neutral axis. These diagonal web-shear cracks start mostly near the neutral axis and propagate in both directions as shown in Fig. 2.18(a). While when both the shear forces and bending moments have large values, the flexural tension cracks form first and their width are
29

controlled by the presence of longitudinal reinforcement. However, when the principal tension stress at the upper end of one or more of these cracks exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete, diagonal tension crack form and propagates known as flexural-shear cracks as shown in Fig. 2.18(b). These flexural-shear cracks are more common than web-shear cracks.

Figure 2.18 Flexural and diagonal tension cracks (Winter and Nilson, 1979)

In reinforced concrete beams, shear is transferred by two mechanisms: beam action and arch action; depending on the shear span a to depth d ratio ( a / d ratio). The contribution of beam action and arch action and the amount of shear reinforcement affects the behaviour of beams failing in shear (Wight and MacGregor, 2012). The moments and shears at inclined cracking and failure of a rectangular beam without shear reinforcement are shown in Fig. 2.19. The shaded areas in Fig. 2.19 show the reduction in strength due to shear. Therefore, web reinforcement is provided to achieve the full flexural capacity.
30

Figure 2.19 Effect of shear span to depth ratio (a/d) on shear strength of beams without stirrups (Wight and MacGregor, 2012)

According to Wight and MacGregor (2012), beams can be classified based on shear span to depth ratio (a/d), into four types: 1. Very short: when the shear span to depth ratio between 0 and 1. These beams develop inclined cracks between the load and the support which in turn destroy the horizontal shear flow from the longitudinal reinforcement to the compression zone, changing the behaviour from beam action to arch action. In this case, the reinforcement serves as the

31

tension tie between the supports, and the failure occurs due to anchorage failure at the ends of the tension tie as shown in Fig. 2.20. 2. Short: when the shear span to depth ratio between 1 and 2.5. These beams develop inclined cracks and are able to carry additional load after the redistribution of internal forces. Failure in these beams usually due to bond failure, a splitting failure or a dowel failure along the tension reinforcement as shown in Fig. 2.21(a) or by crushing of concrete in the compression zone over the shear crack know as shear-compression failure as shown in Fig. 2.21(b). 3. Slender: when the shear span to depth ratio between 2.5 and 6. These beams develop inclined cracks that disrupt the equilibrium to such an extent that the beam fails at the inclined cracking load. 4. Very slender: when the shear span to depth ratio greater than 6. These beams will fail in flexure prior to the formation of inclined cracks.

Figure 2.20 Beams failure mode (ACI- ASCE, 1973)

32

Figure 2.21 modes of failure of short spans with a/d ranging from 1 to 2.5 (ACI- ASCE, 1973)

2.2.2.2 Shear resisting mechanism According to ACI- ASCE committee 445 (1998), five components for shear transfer in cracked concrete beams are identified as shown in Fig. 2.22: 1- Shear resistance provided by uncracked concrete above the neutral axis Vcz 2- Shear transfer along interface of the two faces of the shear cracks known as aggregate interlock Va 3- Dowel action of the tensile reinforcement Vd 4- Residual tensile stresses across the crack due to bridging action Vrt 5- Arch action Vac in deep members
33

These components are generally lumped together and referred to as the concrete contribution to shear strength Vc .

Figure 2.22 Shear resistance components in a cracked concrete beam without shear reinforcement

The concrete contribution for beams with shear reinforcement is influenced by the concrete tensile strength, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, shear span to effective depth ratio, axial forces, and the depth of concrete member (ASCE-ACI committee 445, 1998)

2.2.3 Shear in reinforced concrete beams with shear reinforcement Shear failure in reinforced concrete beams is frequently sudden and without any warning due to the brittle nature of plain concrete behaviour in tension. Therefore, concrete beams are generally reinforced with shear reinforcement to ensure the flexural failure will occur rather than shear failure. Richart (1927) and Moretto (1945) showed experimentally that stirrups in reinforced concrete beams are only effective after the formation of diagonal cracks. Winter and Nilson (1979) reported that the effect of stirrups prior to formation of diagonal cracks was not noticeable and the presence of shear reinforcement will not prevent the formation of diagonal cracks; therefore, the main role of stirrup reinforcement is to carry the redistributed shear stresses through tension after the formation of the diagonal cracks. However, stirrups slow down the propagation of diagonal cracks through their contribution to shear performance of reinforced
34

concrete beams. In addition, stirrup reinforcement controls the crack opening, in turn, helps aggregate interlock resist shear, increase the confinement of the cross section, which increases the compressive strength of the concrete, enhance the bond and prevent a premature splitting failure of longitudinal tensile reinforcement.

After formation of diagonal cracks, the internal forces in a typical reinforced concrete beam reinforced with steel stirrups are shown in Fig. 2.23(a). The shear resisting components are: the shear in compression zone Vcz ; the vertical component of shear transfer across the crack by aggregate interlock Vay ; the dowel action of longitudinal reinforcement Vd ; shear transferred by tension in stirrups V s . Fig. 2.23(b) shows the loading history of such a beam. Prior to flexural cracking, the uncracked concrete carries the entire shear, and as soon as the inclined cracks appear, stirrups contribute and resist a portion of the applied shear. When the applied shear increases, the stirrups yield and their contribution remain constant, which lead to widen the inclined crack, results in decreasing the contribution of aggregate interlock, and increasing the dowel action and uncracked concrete contributions until either a splitting (dowel) failure occurs, or the compression zone crushes due to combined shear and compression stresses.

2.2.4 Shear in steel fibre reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement In steel fibre reinforced concrete SFRC beams without stirrup reinforcement, steel fibres play a similar role to that of stirrups in RC beams. Steel fibres carry the redistributed tensile stresses and slow down the propagation of diagonal cracks through their contribution to shear performance of SFRC beams. In addition, steel fibres control crack opening, foster the formation of multiple diagonal cracks, and prevent a premature splitting failure along the tensile reinforcement. However, in shear strength analysis of SFRC beams without stirrups present several challenges due to uncertain distribution of fibres in concrete that lead to non-uniform mechanical properties, and the widening of diagonal cracks in SFRC which are due to fibre pullout instead of stirrups yielding in RC beams. This makes the problem more complicated due to complex behaviour of fibres pullout and bond between fibres and concrete.

35

(b) Distribution of internal shear Figure 2.23 Internal forces in a cracked concrete beam with stirrups (ACI- ASCE, 1973)

Many researchers investigated the shear behaviour of SFRC beams without stirrups. They investigated the following parameters: cross section shape, beam size, tensile reinforcement ratio, beam slenderness, aggregate size, concrete tensile strength and ductility.
36

Swamy and Bahia (1985), and Rosenbusch and Teutsch (2002) studied the effect of beam cross sectional shape by comparing the shear behaviour of rectangular beams with that of T-beams. Swamy and Bahia showed that T-beams with flange thickness equal to one fifth of the beam depth and flange width equal to three times the web width results in 30% increase in the ultimate shear strength compared to rectangular beams. Rosenbusch and Teutsch showed that the load deflection response not significantly influenced by changing the flange width from 20 to 40 inches, while changing the flange thickness from 6 in to 8 in led to 54% increase in the ultimate shear strength compared to rectangular beam with the same height.

Schanzt (1993), Adebar et al. (1997), Noghabai (2000), Rosenbusch and Teutsch (2002), and Dinh et al. (2010) investigated the size effect of shear behaviour of SFRC beams, Noghabai showed that increase in the effective depth from 409 mm to 569 mm results a 15% decrease in average shear stress at failure. While Dinh et al. (2010) showed that increase the effective depth from 457 mm to 686 mm resulted in a 7% decrease in the shear stress, and concluded that size effect is negligible for beam depths up to 686 mm.

The effect of shear span to effective depth ratio on shear behaviour of SFRC beams has been extensively investigated by researchers. Batson et al. (1972) proposed a critical value of 3 of shear span to effective depth ratio for SFRC beams to distinguish between deep and slender beams. Ashour et al. (1992), Swamy et al. (1993), and Dina et al. (2010) investigated the effect of longitudinal tensile reinforcement ratio on the beam strength. They concluded that higher tensile reinforcement ratio resulted in higher shear strength due to increase dowel action and deeper compression zone.

Kwak et al. (2002) studied the effect of SFRC compressive strength on the shear strength of reinforced SFRC beams. They found the shear strength increased 20% when the concrete compressive strength doubled.

37

Dina et al. (2010) showed that minimum fibre volume content greater than or equal to 0.75% led to multiple diagonal cracking and a substantial increase in shear strength compared to reinforced concrete beams without stirrup reinforcement. Susetyo et al. (2011) showed that 0.5% fibre content was incapable of controlling crack propagation in reinforced concrete panels.

The safety margins of the shear design provisions of the AFGC (Association FranÃ§aise de GÃ©nie Civil) were investigated by Baby et al. (2010) on nine 3 m long I-shaped girders with various types of shear reinforcement (stirrups only, fibres only, and stirrups/fibres). They found that the ratio between the ultimate predicted and experimentally applied loads for beams without stirrups was around 0.52. Yang et al. (2012) investigated the shear behaviour of UHPFRC beams. UHPFRC I beam specimens with a depth 700 mm were casted as shown in Fig. 2.24. They investigated the shear span to effective depth ratio, the volume content of steel fibres, and the presence or absence of pre-stress. Test results showed that the ultimate shear strength decreases as the shear span to effective depth ratio increases due to the arch action at the low shear span to effective depth ratio.

Figure 2.24 Beam cross-section area (Yang et al., 2012) 38

2.2.5 Shear strength analysis of SFRC beams Shear behaviour of SFRC beams is complicated due to many factors affecting shear strength. The primary controlling factors are the tensile strength of fibre reinforced concrete, shear span to effective depth ratio, and longitudinal reinforcement ratio. The tensile strength of SFRC beams are affected by fibre aspect ratio, fibre geometry, fibre content, and fibre tensile strength. In this section, some of the main methods that were developed to predict the shear behaviour of SFRC beams are presented.

Sharma (1986) Sharma studied the shear behaviour of SFRC beams by testing seven normal and SFRC beams subjected to bending and shear. The beams were 150 mm x 300 mm in cross section with concrete compressive strength between 42.3 MPa and 48.6 MPa. Stirrups were provided only at load points and supports. Based on the splitting tensile strength f sp , and shear span to effective depth ratio a / d , Sharma proposed the ultimate shear strength as follows:

d 0.25 vu  (k1 f sp ) a
where,

(2.18)

vu is shear stress of fibrous concrete, is a constant equal to 2/3 as suggested by Wright k1

(1955), who found out that direct tensile stress of the order of 2/3 of the splitting tensile strength. It can be noted from equation (2.18) that the contribution of fibres and longitudinal reinforcement ratio were not introduced in the expression. To determine the tensile strength of concrete f sp , Sharma used the following equation that was adopted from European Concrete Committee (1993):

f sp  9.5 f c (psi)

(2.19)

Sharma validated the expression with 41 SFRC beams and showed good estimates.

39

Mansur, Ong, and Paramasivam (1986) Mansur et al. adopted the ACI-ASCE Committee 426 equation for shear that takes into account the contribution of shear strength in compression region, aggregate interlock and dowel action, and include the contribution of fibres to shear strength by calculating the post-cracking tensile strength,  pc , that can be obtained from direct tensile test of dog-bone specimens.

(2.20)

To include the effect of arch action, the ratio M / V was defined as:

M M max a   V V 2 M M max  d V V

for a / d  2.0

(2.21)

for a / d  2.0

(2.22)

They used the post-cracking tensile strength,  pc , that proposed by Swamy and Al-Taan (1981), and assuming that this stress is uniformly distributed over the critical diagonal crack, and assuming that the horizontal projection of this critical crack is equal to the effective depth of the beam d.

Narayanan and Darwish (1987) Narayanan and Darwish investigated the behaviour of SFRC beams subjected to shear. They tested 49 beams simply supported rectangular beams under symmetrical concentrated loads, 10 beams contained conventional stirrups and 33 were reinforced with crimped steel fibres as web reinforcement. Test results showed that shear cracks in SFRC beams were similar to that in conventional RC beams. However, the spacings between cracks in the SFRC beams were closer than that in conventional RC beams. They attributed that to the redistribution of stresses beyond cracking, and fibres become more effective after shear cracking by resisting the principal tensile stresses until the complete pullout of all fibres occurred at one critical crack. In addition, the inclusion of steel fibres eliminated the spalling of concrete even at very late stages of failure compared with some spalling occurred at the ultimate stages in beams reinforced with
40

conventional stirrups. They showed that the shear failure in specimens with shear span to effective depth ratio a / d  3 was due to splitting failure or failure in the compression zone as shown in Fig. 2.25(a), while for specimens with shear span to effective depth ratio a / d  2.5 was due to compression splitting failure, flexural failure or crushing of concrete zone as shown in Fig. 2.25(b).

To consider the shear contribution of steel fibres, v f , they assumed the diagonal crack angle is 45, and the average bond strength of fibre,  , was assumed to be the average pullout length l f / 4 , and the number of fibres over a unit area n fib was adopted from the work of Romualdi et al. (1964) as follows:

n fib 

1.64Vsf

d 2 f

(2.23)

Thus, the shear contribution of steel fibres, v f , counted on a diagonal crack that has vertical projection equal to the distance between the center of tension reinforcement to the upper tip of diagonal crack is:
v f  0.41Vsf lf df

(2.24)

where,   average bond strength of fibre taken as 4.15 MPa based on flexural strength results by Swamy et al. (1974). Equation (2.25) was modified to account for the effect of fibre geometry on bond,  , as follows:

v f  0.41F
where, F  Vsf

(2.25)

 is the fibre factor, and the bond factor,  , was adopted from Narayanan and

Kareem-Palanjian (1984), is approximately 0.5, 0.75, and 1 for round, crimped, and indented fibres respectively.

Based on, regression analysis for 91 test results, and taking into account the fibre contribution to the total shear strength in terms of split tensile strength, f sp , dowel action, and the shear span to effective depth ratio a / d , the ultimate shear strength is:
d  vu  e  Af sp  B    v f a 

(2.26)

where, e is a non-dimensional factor that takes into account the effect of arch action and is equal to 1 for slender beams

a / d  2.8 , and is equal to 2.8d / a for shorter beams a / d  2.8 ;

this model that the contribution of shear in the compression region was not directly specified. In addition, the authors neglect the contribution of aggregate interlock.

Al- Ta'an and Al-Feel (1990) Al- Ta'an and Al-Feel proposed a method to calculated the ultimate shear strength of SFRC beams based on an equation developed by Zsutty (1971), and Places and Regan (1971) that takes into account the contribution of uncracked compression zone, aggregate interlock, and dowel action, v c , as shown in equations (2.27), and (2.28)

The contribution of fibre was obtained by considering the post cracking tensile stress along the diagonal crack. To estimate the contribution of fibres to the shear resistance, the depth of neutral axis was calculated by equating the external moment to the internal resisting moment as shown in Fig. 2.26 and equation (2.29):

M u  Vu * a  vcbda   0.85 f cac b(d 

ac  f y (d  d ) )  As 2

(2.29)

where, vc = ultimate shear strength without fibres (MPa) d = effective depth of beam (m) a = shear span (m)

a c = equivalent compression stress block depth

 = Flexural reduction factor

43

d  = depth of compression steel reinforcement (m)

Figure 2.26 Forces within fibre reinforced concrete beam with diagonal tension crack (Al- Ta'an and Al-Feel, 1990)

It was observed that the effect of steel fibres on flexural strength is small and not more that 10% (Al- Ta'an and Al-Feel, 1990); therefore, this increase in the moment resistance was used to eliminate the flexural reduction factor. To determine the contribution of steel fibre to ultimate shear strength, they calculated the post-cracking strength,  pc , as follows:
 pc  n fib . f fib

(2.30)

Where n fib is the number of fibres crossing a unit area, and can be obtained from a proposal by Aveston et al. (1974):

n fib 

2Vsf

d 2 f

(2.31)

and f fib = average fibre pull-out force per fibre can be determined from equation (2.32) assuming the average fibre pull-out length is l f / 4
f fib  d f l f / 4

(2.32)

44

where,   average bond strength of fibre taken as 4.15 MPa based on flexural strength results by Swamy and Mangat (1976). This leads to a post-cracking strength,  pc , as follows:
 pc  0.5F

(2.33)

Therefore, the unit stress provided by the fibre is:

v f   pcb(h  c) / d

(2.34)

where, c = depth of compression region. Thus the total ultimate shear strength of SFRC beams is:

vu  vc  v f

(2.35)

This method compared with experimental data of 89 SFRC beams by other researches, and gave acceptable results.

Ashour, Hasanain, and Wafa (1992) Ashour et al. tested 18 rectangular high strength fibre reinforced concrete beams subjected to combined shear and flexure. All beam were singly reinforced and without shear reinforcement. Test results showed that steel fibres increased the shear strengths, stiffness, and ductility of beams. They modified the ACI committee 318 equation on shear by incorporating the effect of shear span to effective depth ratio a / d from a regression analysis to the parameters

(2.38)

The shear strength of fibre, v f , can be calculated form equation (2.25) similar to Narayanan and Darwish (1987). The above equations showed good agreement with the test results by the author.

Khuntia, Stojadinovic, and Goel (1999) Khuntia et al. adopted the ACI Committee 318 equation for shear equation (2.39) that takes into account the contribution of shear strength in compression region, aggregate interlock and dowel action, and include the contribution of fibres to shear strength by using equation (2.25).

vc  0.167 f c

(2.39)

Based on suggestion by Naaman (1987) that the fibre bond stress for hooked steel fibres is about 2 times the tensile strength of plain concrete, they assumed the bond stress of fibres as follows:

  0.68 f c

MPa

(2.40)

By applying equation (2.40) into (2.25), and assuming the vertical projection of the diagonal crack equal to 0.9d, the shear strength of fibres,
vf

, becomes: (2.41)

v f  0.25F f c

MPa

To include the arch action, they multiplied the total shear strength by the arch action factor A , equal to 2.5d / a . Therefore, the ultimate shear strength is:

vu  0.167 A  0.25F  f c

(2.42)

Equation (2.42) was validated with tested beams from different researches and showed good results.

Kwak, Eberhard, Woo-Suk Kim, and Jubum Kim (2002) Kwak et al. developed an equation to predict the shear strength of fiber reinforced concrete beams based on an equation developed by Zsutty's (1971) that takes into account the influence of tensile strength on arching action with additional fibre term as proposed by Narayanan and Darwish as shown in equation (2.24). Therefore, the ultimate shear strength is:

where e is a function of the a / d ratio which is equal to 1 for a / d  3.4 , and equal to

3. 4 d for a

a / d  3.4 . Equation (2.43) was validated with 139 tested beams from different researches and
showed good results for concrete with a compressive strength between 31 and 65 MPa.

Aoude et al. (2012) Aoude et al. proposed a model to predict the shear behaviour of SFRC beams. They assumed the shear resistance of SFRC beam is equivalent to the expected shear strength of a traditional reinforced concrete beam plus additional shear resistance provided by fibres and can be calculated from equation (2.35). They obtained the shear strength vc for a traditional reinforced concrete beam from Modified compression field theory (Collins et al., 1996), and the fibre contribution to shear resistance from equation (2.43):
V f  n fib * 0.83 f fib * bw * d v * cot 

(2.44)

where, n fib is the effective number of fibres per unit area, and can be obtained from equation (2.31),  is the crack inclination, and f fib is the fibre pullout strength that can be calculated from equation (2.44)

(2.46)

The proposed model validated with the experiment results by the author and other researches and showed good estimates.

A summary of the relationships that have been proposed in the literature for predicting the shear resistance of fibre reinforced concrete beams is shown in Table 2.1.

2.3 Composite reinforced concrete beams
UHPFRC material is a new material that needs to be investigated in order to better characterize its properties and optimize its use in structural applications. A few works have been dedicated to study the behaviour of composite "UHPFRC- concrete" elements for slender beams with a / d between 3 and 4. Structural applications with the concept of composite concrete-concrete elements were studied by Habel et al. (2006), and Martinola et al. (2010). They investigated the compatibility of two materials of different ages, their long term behaviour, transverse cracking and debonding risk. They proposed a model to add a layer of UHPFRC with steel bars as an external tensile flexural reinforcement. The early age material properties appeared important for successful structural interventions. Kamen et al. (2008) performed analysis of thermomechanical behaviour at early age of UHPFRC. They studied hydration, shrinkage under different temperatures, and performed first creep tests in tension. Noshiravani and Bruhwiler (2010) investigated the structural response of composite UHPFRC-RC beams subjected to bending and shear. The results show that the UHPFRC layer increases the member shear strength without impairing the deformation capacity. They used the Critical Shear Crack Theory to show the enhanced response of the composite beams.

Bond characteristics at the interface zone are one of the most difficult phenomena to predict due to difference in composition, and material property. Different test methods have been proposed to assess the bond strength between the two different concrete materials. The basic types of bond tests are direct tension tests, direct shear tests, indirect tension tests, shear and compression tests, and pull off test (Saucier et al., 1991) 2.3.1 Tension tests: Tension tests can be classified into direct and indirect tests. In a direct tension test as shown in Fig. 2.27(a), the tensile force is transmitted to the concrete either by glued metal or by special grips. In this test, the alignment of the specimen is essential; therefore the test consumes a lot of time to get good results (Saucier et al., 1991). However, the indirect tension tests include flexural tests and splitting tests as shown in Fig. 2.27(c) are much easier to perform. In flexural test, the area of the bonded surface subjected to loading is small compared to the specimen volume, leads to only a small part of the bonded plane is subjected to the maximum stress; therefore, the efficiency of this test is low compared to direct tension test (Momayez et. al., 2005). The splitting test is more efficient in this regard, and the method was later adopted as a standard test ASTM C496.

Figure 2.27 Different types of bond tensile test

50

The pull-off test as shown in Fig. 2.27(b) is a relatively new bond test. In this test, the preparation of the specimen involved preparation of the concrete surface, gluing on a disc using a fast curing epoxy, partial coring around the disc perpendicular to the planed surface, and pulling the disc using a calibrated hydraulic pull machine reacting against a centered counter pressure resting on the planed surface. The results of this method are more accurate in predicting the tensile bond strength.

2.3.2 Shear tests: In a direct shear test as shown in Fig. 2.28(a), the bonded surface is subjected to shear stress and a small bending stress due to some stress concentrations at the edge of the bonding planes leading to scatter in the test results (Saucier et al., 1991, Momayez et. al., 2005). The shear stress is combined with a compression stress in the axis perpendicular to the bonding plane in the slant shear test as shown in Fig. 2.28(b). The composite cylinder in slant test is loaded as in a standard compression test. This test was modified by Wall and Shrive (1988) by using a prism with a length three times the cross sectional dimension. The results of the modified test showed that a slight misalignment of the two halves of the prism specimen has negligible effects on the capacity of the composite specimens.

Figure 2.28 Different types of bond shear test

51

2.3.3 Splitting prism test Momayez et al. (2005) investigated the effect of different test methods on bond strength between concrete substrate and repair material. In their study, four test methods pull-off, slant shear, splitting prism and a new direct shear named Bi-Surface shear test as shown in Fig. 2.29 with cementitious or modified-cementitious repair materials, and two surface roughness's were studied. They found that the bond strength dependent on the test method used. They observed from test results that the measured bond strength decreases with the test method in the following order: slant shear, Bi-Surface shear, splitting, and pull-off.

Chapter 3 Experimental Program

The experimental study consists of two main phases: the first phase of the experimental program was to investigate the shear and flexural behaviour of ultra-high performance reinforced concrete, UHPFRC, and ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete, UHPFRC, without web reinforcement. The second phase of the experimental program focused on the development of new composite beams build with the combination of ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete and conventional normal strength concrete, NSC, and high strength concrete, HSC, and on investigating the shear and flexural behaviour of UHPFRC-NSC and UHPFRC-HSC composite beams.

This chapter presents the details of test specimens, test setup, test procedure, and the properties of different material used in this experimental program. A total of twenty eight beams were tested. In addition, tests to obtain the mechanical properties of the materials (cylinder tests, split tensile tests, four points bending tests, splitting prism tests) were performed. The following sections provide details of the experimental program.

3.1 Material properties
3.1.1 Concrete mixture The UHPC mixture that was used in this study is a commercial product, DuctalÂ®, which is composed of premix powder, water, superplasticizer. The premix powder includes cement, silica fume, ground quartz, and sand. Table 3.1 shows the typical composition of this material. The NSC mixture used in this study is a commercial product provided by Dufferin concrete while the HSC mixture is a commercial product provided by Innocon concrete. Both mixtures have a maximum aggregate size 19 mm.

3.1.2 Selection of fibres type and volume content One type and three quantities of fibres were incorporated in this study. DuctalÂ® UHPFRC suggested the use of straight steel fibres geometry (13 mm length x 0.2 mm diameter) with a tensile strength above 2500 MPa as shown in Fig. 3.1. This is in agreement with the recommendations of the Japanese code for UHPFRC. Previous research conducted by Dina et al. (2010) and Susetyo et al. (2011) has shown that 0.5% fibre volume content is incapable of controlling crack propagation in reinforced concrete panels. Therefore, to determine the effect of fibre volume content on the shear behaviour of UHPFRC beams, three volume content ratios of steel fibres were used in the present study, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%.

3.1.3 Selection of longitudinal steel reinforcement The longitudinal steel reinforcements used in this study were obtained locally, conforming to the Canadian Standard Association (CSA) Standard G30.14-M83. To determine the mechanical properties of the reinforcing steel, tension tests were performed on six randomly obtained deformed from each batch of the 25M, 30M reinforcing bars. All of the coupons exhibited a yield plateau, with average experimental yield strengths of 474 MPa, and 468 MPa and ultimate strength of 590 MPa, and 688 MPa respectively.

3.2 Design of beam specimens
3.2.1 Selection of shear span to effective depth ratio a / d As discussed in chapter two, deep beam classified when a / d  2.5 and slender beam when

a / d  2.5 . Different a / d ratios were investigated to examine the effect of arch action on shear
behaviour of UHPFRC beams. For series 2 and 3, all the beams were having a / d ratio of 3 to minimize the effect of arch action.

3.2.2 Beam size According to ACI specification 11.4.6.1, no minimum area of shear reinforcement is required for reinforced concrete flexural members for beams with height not greater than 250 mm. Thus, the minimum beam depth in this test program was designed to be 300 mm. All the beams had cross section of 150 wide and 300 mm deep.

3.2.3 Selection of longitudinal steel reinforcement ratio As previously mentioned, UHPFRC is a new material without any design guidelines for shear. The elementary calculations of the shear strength of the beams were based on Parra-Montesinos recommendation (2006), the shear strength for steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) with a fibre volume content of 1% is 0.3 f c ( MPa ) , which was considered adequate for the purpose of evaluating the use of deformed steel fibres as minimum shear regardless of concrete compressive strength and the effective span depth, while the shear strength for SFRC concrete

55

with a fibre volume content greater than 1% is 0.4 f c ( MPa ) . These assumptions based on a concrete compressive strength of up to 103MPa; it should be noted that these assumptions were used in the present program as elementary calculations for the shear strength of the beams. For example to determine the shear load required of beam with shear span to effective depth ratio

a / d  3.5 , and fibre volume content 1% is:

Table 3.2 shows the calculation of shear strength based on these assumptions. However, all of the fibre reinforced beams in series 1 failed in flexure. Therefore, the flexural capacity of the beams was increased in series by using 4-30M in order to investigate the shear behaviour of the
56

beams. Experimental results of series 1 showed that both beams with 1% and 2% fibre volume content failed in flexure, and testing another beam with 1.5% fibre volume content will not contribute to the study. Therefore, the beam with 1.5% fibre volume content in series 1 was omitted.

Based on the experimental results in series 1, the test beams in phase 1 were classified according to their steel reinforcement ratio as shown in Fig. 3.2. Beams in series 1 were 1275 mm long with a cross section of 150 mm wide by 300 mm deep, and beams in series 2 were 1284 mm long with a cross section of 150 mm wide by 300 mm deep. The experimental parameters of the test beams in both series are summarized in Table 3.3. The length of the beams was designed to provide a left shear span to effective depth ratio between 1.5 and 3.5 in series 1 and 3.0 in series 2. The end reinforcing bars were bended to prevent anchorage failure as shown in Fig 3.2. In addition, the right span was reinforced with enough stirrups to ensure shear failure in the left span. Four longitudinal bars were used as the main reinforcement, and 15M bars were used as compression reinforcement in all beams with concrete cover thickness of 20 mm.

The specimen nomenclature was derived as follows: the first and second letters indicate the type of concrete strength (concrete mixture) used in the specimen followed by the series number of the specimen, the following number indicates the volume of fibre content used and the last number indicates the shear span to effective depth ratio. For example, specimen US1-1-3.5 is a specimen cast using UHPC strength with a series 1 configuration which has a 1% fibre volume content and shear span to effective depth ratio of 3.5. In series 2, two UHPC beams without fibre content (US2-0-3.0-a and US2-0-3.0-b) were tested to act as control specimens.
57

In the second phase the composite beam combining UHPFRC-NSC and UHPFRC-HSC materials were developed and investigated. The length of the beam was designed to provide a left shear span to effective depth of 3.0 and no anchorage failure will occur as shown in Fig 3.2. In addition, the shorter span was reinforced with enough stirrups to ensure shear failure in the longer span.

According to ACI code (ACI, 2011), which states that the steel reinforcement should be well distributed over the zone of maximum concrete tension, the total effective tension area of the concrete surrounding the reinforcement is double the distance from the face of outside tension fibre to the centroid of the tension reinforcement, y, multiplied by the beam width as shown in Fig. 3.3a. The NSC and HSC were bonded to the UHPFRC using either shear stud connectors or dowels as shown in Fig. 3.3b. Two dowels of 10M bars were installed 200 mm, and 400 mm from the left support and used as a shear connector with the beams reinforced with dowels. For the beams reinforced with shear studs, three shear studs with 10 mm diameter and 100 MPa

tensile strength were placed 150 mm spacing from the left support and used as a shear connector for the beams. Series 3 test variables are summarized in Table 3.4

The shear span to effective depth ratio in all beams in series 3 was 3.0. Therefore, the specimen nomenclature of series 3 was derived as follows without indicating the shear span to effective depth ratio: the first and second letters indicate the type of concrete strength (concrete mixture) used in the specimen followed by the series number of the specimen, the following number indicates the volume of fibre used and the last number indicates the shear connector. For

60

example, specimen UN3-1D is a specimen cast using UHPFRC-NSC strength with a series 3 configuration which has 1% fibre volume content and dowels as the shear connector.

3.3 Preparation of test specimens
Wooden forms were used to cast the beam test specimens. A thin layer of grease was applied to the internal surfaces to ensure easy stripping and to prevent water absorption. The reinforcements were placed inside the forms, providing a minimum clear concrete cover of 20 mm. The UHPFRC was mixed in a 250 L capacity shear mixer. After casting, the UHPC specimens were sprayed with water and covered with plastic sheets and were stored at room temperature until the day of testing.

When casting composite members, the setting time for UHPFRC is longer than NSC, HSC, and the UHPC premix provided by Lafarge Inc. without an accelerator. For this reason, the beams were casted upside down. The NSC/HSC layer was casted first and then the UHPFRC layer was casted on top of the NSC/HSC layer without any surface preparation of the NSC or HSC layers prior to casting. After casting, the composite specimens were sprayed with water and covered with plastic sheets and were stored at room temperature until the day of testing. However, the NSC and HSC specimen were cured for 28 days. All the beams in phase 1 were tested after 28 days of casting. The composite beams in phase 2 with NSC were tested after 28 days and the composite beams with HSC were tested after 90 days.

It should be noted that the NSC/HSC layer need vibration to consolidate the concrete by removing the entrapped air to the surface and allowing concrete to flow into corners, around the reinforcement rebar and flush against the form face. Therefore, the NSC/HSC layer must cast first then the UHPFRC layer which is self-consolidated. Thus, the proposed composite system is applicable to precast concrete.

3.4 Test setup and procedure
The simply supported beam specimens were subjected to a concentrated load that was applied at a distance from the left support according to the shear span to effective depth ratios for series 1 and at the mid-span for series 2 and 3. The test setup is shown in Fig. 3.4. In this system, the force of the hydraulic actuator machine was measured by a load cell with 1340 kN loading capacity. During the testing procedure, loading was incrementally increased by 20 kN. Between loading increments, the beams were inspected for the initiation of any cracks and marked. In series 1, two potentiometers were installed under the loading point at the mid span on each beam to measure the deflection as shown in Fig. 3.4.

Figure 3.4 Test setup for beams in series 1

For series 2 and 3, two potentiometers were installed under the loading point at the mid span of each beam on each side to measure the deflection as shown in Fig. 3.5. For series 1, eight strain
62

gauges labelled S1 to S8 were attached to the bottom reinforcing bars. For series 2 and3, six strain gauges labelled S1 to S6 were attached to the bottom reinforcing bars to measure the strain of the reinforcement and three 60 mm concrete strain gauges labelled C1 to C3 were mounted onto the concrete surface along the height of the mid-span of the beam at distances 20 mm, 70 mm and 150 mm from the top layer as shown in Fig. 3.2. In addition, three crack gauges were used for series 3 to measure the crack width at the interface between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers. The crack gauges were mounted on the concrete surface at a distance 150 mm, 300 mm, and 450 mm from the left support as shown in Fig. 3.2. Gauge readings were recorded until they became unreliable due to the cracking in the underlying concrete. These gauges were capable of detecting strain due to small crack openings in each location. However, the readings of concrete strain gauges were unreliable when a localised macro crack developed and hence were not considered.

3.5 Tests
3.5.1 Mechanical properties of concrete  The compressive strength, f c , of the UHPFRC, NSC and HSC was obtained through compressive testing of cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and height of 200 mm in accordance with ASTM C39/C39M. The cylindrical specimens were cast at the same time as the test beams. After casting, the UHPFRC specimens were covered with plastic sheets and were stored at room temperature for 28 days, while the NSC and HSC specimens were cured for 28 days. The ends of the cylinder were ground to remove the weak paste layers, and to ensure that the cylinders were uniformly and axially loaded. All specimens were tested at the same day as the beams.

3.5.2 Split cylinder test The tensile strength of the UHPC and the UHPFRC was obtained through spilt cylinder testing,
f sp , of specimens in accordance with ASTM C496 "Standard Test Method for Splitting Tensile

Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens". The same concrete cylinder used in the compression test was placed on its side and a compression force was applied along the diameter of the concrete cylinder, as shown in Fig. 3.6(a), (Wight and MacGregor, 2012). Fig. 3.6(c) shows an element on the vertical diameter subjected to biaxial tension and compression stresses, and Fig. 3.6(d) shows the distribution of both compression and tension stresses along the vertical circular face. There are two areas of high transverse compression on the far ends of the top and bottom of the vertical circular face of the concrete cylinder, but on the rest of the diameter, there is almost a uniform tension. The ends of the cylinder were ground flat to remove the weak paste layers. All specimens were tested at the same day of testing the beams.

3.5.3 Flexural test In order to determine the flexural tensile strength of UHPFRC, bending tests were performed on concrete prisms 152 x 152 x 457 mm in size. The composite UHPFRC-NSC/HSC prisms were made up of a 101 mm NSC/HSC layer at the top, and a 51 mm UHPC layer at the bottom. The NSC/HSC and UHPFRC layers were cast at the same time; the NSC/HSC layer was cast first and then the UHPFRC layer was cast on the top. In order to allow for better visualization, the NSC and HSC layers were painted white and the UHPFRC layer was painted grey. For each composite type, a minimum of three four-point un-notched bending tests were performed while loaded at a rate of 0.05 mm/min in accordance with ASTM C 1609 (2006). Measurements were obtained from a set of four potentiometers, one at each support to measure the support displacement and two at mid-span to measure the mid-span displacement. The net mid-span deflections were determined using these measurements and the load-deflection curve was drawn. In addition, the first-cracking load, and the ultimate load of the concrete were registered during the tests. The first-cracking strength and the ultimate cracking strength were calculated according to eq. (3.8).

3.5.4 Bond strength between UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers To evaluate the bond characteristics between the UHPFRC, NSC/HSC materials, splitting test were performed with 150 mm cube specimens. The specimens were loaded along an interface plane to simulate a tensile load perpendicular to the plane as shown in Fig. 3.8. This test followed a similar procedure as the ASTM C496 test used for splitting tensile strength of

cylindrical concrete specimens. Three samples of each UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite were tested using this method and the average values of the three specimens were evaluated for each combination.

Chapter 4 Experimental Results of UHPFRC Members

This chapter describes the material tests conducted in this experimental program and provides details on the analytical procedure used to study the structural behaviour of the UHPFRC tested beams. To study the specimens' structural behaviour, including, its load Â­ deflection relationship, reinforcement strains, crack pattern, and concrete strains in the critical shear span, each beam was analysed separately. In addition, this chapter compares the responses of UHPFRC specimens with that of the UHPC specimens to better understand the benefits associated with the use of steel fibres in UHPC members.

4.1 Cylinder compressive strength
Results from the concrete cylinder compressive strength tests are shown in Table 4.1. The results summarized in Table 4.1 indicate that fibre addition didn't significantly affect the compressive strength of the concrete. It was observed from the tests that the UHPC without fibres addition exhibit explosive failures during compression tests while UHPFRC did not exhibit explosive failures during compression tests. This can be attributed to the restraining and confining effects of the fibres. Fig. 4.1 shows the different failure modes of UHPC and UHPFRC cylinders under the compression-loading test.

4.2 Split cylinder tests
As was mentioned earlier, cracking is a form of tension failure. Hence, the purpose of tensile strength of concrete is necessary to determine the load at which the concrete members may crack. The results of the splitting tensile strength tests, f sp , for each cylinder were calculated according to equation (3.1), and summarised in Table 4.2. The results indicate that fibre addition enhanced the splitting tensile strength of the concrete. It was also observed that the addition of the fibres altered the failure mode of the cylinders tested. A brittle splitting failure mode was observed in the non-fibre reinforced concrete cylinders, while the fibre reinforced concrete cylinders remained intact with indications of hairline crack fracture across the length of the cylinders. It was noted that the fibres increased the splitting resistance of the concrete by limiting and controlling the transverse tensile stresses and strains in the concrete. Fig. 4.2 shows the different cylinder splitting failure modes of UHPC and UHPFRC cylinders.

4.3 Flexural tests
The flexural behaviour of UHPC and UHPFRC prism specimens differed significantly. The prism specimens without the addition of fibre underwent brittle failure and the first crack propagated quickly after initiation, leading to a sudden drop in load carrying capacity after reaching the peak load. For the fibre prisms, the first crack propagated slowly until failure. The prisms were also able to carry the load after failure. This demonstrates that the fibres have the

71

ability to redistribute stresses across the crack until fibres pull out from the matrix. The addition of fibres enhanced the flexural strength and ductility of the concrete prisms.

The average first crack load and the average peak crack load were calculated according to equation (3.2), and summarized in Table 4.3. The first crack load and the first crack deflection are the loads where the first crack initiated and its corresponding deflection while the peak load and peak deflection are the peak load and its corresponding deflection. The average first crack load was calculated by obtaining the mean of all deflections at first crack loads. The average first crack load is the load corresponding to average deflection that was calculated by interpolating the two nearest points on the load-deflection curves. Similar procedure used to calculate the average peak load and its corresponding deflection. Fig. 4.3 shows the cracking behaviour of UHPFRC prisms. After first crack initiated in the prisms with 0% fibre content (US0), the crack propagated very fast and the prisms suddenly collapsed, while crack propagated slowly after initiation in the prisms with 1% (US1), 1.5% (US1.5), and 2% (US2) fibre content. Therefore, adding fibres to the UHPC changed the failure mode from brittle mode to ductile mode. Fig. 4.4 shows the load versus net deflection relationship for series US0, US1, US1.5, and US2 respectively.

The average first crack load, first crack deflection, peak load, and peak deflection are shown in Table 4.3. The addition of fibres enhanced the flexural strength and ductility of the concrete prisms as shown in Table 4.3 and Fig. 4.5. The average ultimate load for UHPFRC (US) prisms with 0%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibres volume content were 43.88, 66.09, 76.93 and 85.45 kN respectively. It can be noted from Table 4.3 that the addition of steel fibres enhanced the flexural capacity by 83%, 127%, and 136% for US1, US1.5, and US2 respectively.

The toughness of concrete prisms was calculated by estimating the area under the load-deflection curve up to a net deflection of 1/150 of the span length. Table 4.4 shows the flexural toughness number rounded to the nearest Joule, and the modulus of rupture f r , which was determined by flexural members that had dimensions of 152 x 152 x 457 mm. It was observed that the addition of steel fibres significantly improved the toughness of the prisms (as shown in Table 4.4). For instance, concrete prisms with 1% fibres were approximately 27 times tougher than concrete prisms without fibres.

4.4 Behaviour of beam tests
4.4.1 Beam US1-0-3.5 Figures 4.10 and 4.11 show the load versus central deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure respectively. Inclined cracks began to develop in the left span at the mid depth of the beam at an applied load 190 kN. As the load increased, the cracks began to propagate to the bottom surface of the beam and to the loading point simultaneously. Additional cracks developed at the shear span before the crack width increased and the beam failed at an applied load of 240 kN. It can be seen from Fig. 4.11 that the crack propagated along the top and lower layer of the reinforcing bars at the lower end of the inclined crack. This can be attributed to lower dowel action mechanism combined with bond failure at the steel concrete interface. From Fig. 4.10, it can be seen that the central deflection increased linearly and it was proportional with the applied load up to a load of 200 kN where the first crack developed in the left span. Beyond this point, the relationship between the load and central deflection was nonlinear. The deflection at ultimate load was 3.15 mm and the maximum deflection of the beam was 4.79 mm.

Fig. 4.12 shows the load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US1-0-3.5. It can be noted from Fig. 4.12 that the strains at S2 and S3 gauges were very small up to the load at first diagonal crack (190 kN). Then the strains at these gauges started to increase due to the inclined cracks that developed in the vicinity of the gauges. At the peak load the strain at S1 through S8 were still in the linear range of the reinforcement stress-strain curve.

4.4.2 Beam US1-1-3.5 Figures 4.13 and 4.14 show the load versus deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure respectively. Flexural cracks began to develop from the bottom surface of the beam in the region below the loading point at applied load 430 kN. As the applied load increased to 600 kN, another cracks developed in the mid depth of the beam below the loading point where the maximum moment occurred. At the same time, cracks at bottom surface of the beam developed below the loading point. As the applied load increased to 667 kN, these cracks were connected together and the beam failed as shown in Fig. 4.14. It can be noted from Fig. 4.13 that the central deflection increased linearly with the applied load up to a load of 560 kN even after the initiation of the first flexural crack. The addition of steel fibres significantly increased the ductility of the UHPC beams as shown in Fig. 4.13. The deflection at the ultimate load was 10.559 mm and the maximum deflection at failure was 14.418 mm.

Fig. 4.15 shows the load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US1-1-3.5. It can be noted from Fig. 4.15 that the strain gauge S8 was very small up to 520 kN load, then the flexural cracks started to propagate toward the loading point while the strains at S1, S2 and S3 gauges were very small due to the fact that no cracks were developed at the region close the left support. The strains at most of the gauges were proportionally linear up to a load which depends
80

of the location of the strain gauges then the strains at these gauges started to increase rapidly due to the cracks that developed in the vicinity of the gauges. The lower layer reinforcing steel bar yielded at S7, S5, and S8 at an applied load 440, 530, 617 kN respectively.

4.4.3 Beam US1-2-3.5 Figures 4.16 and 4.17 show the load versus deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure respectively. Flexural cracks started to develop from the bottom surface of the beam in the region below the loading point at applied load 650 kN. As the applied load increased to 690 kN, another cracks developed, below the loading point where the maximum moment occurred. As the applied load increased to 724 kN, the crack width increased and the beam failed as shown in Fig. 4.17. It can be noted from Fig. 4.16 that the central deflection at the ultimate load was 8.78 mm and the maximum deflection at failure, was 10.05 mm. It can be noted from Fig. 4.18 that the central deflection increased linearly with the applied load up to a load of 600 kN where the flexural cracks started to propagate to the loading point.

Fig. 4.18 shows the load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US1-2-3.5. It can be noted from Fig. 4.18 that the strain at S3, S7 and S8 were increased linearly with the applied load increased. The upper layer of steel reinforcing bar was yielded at S8 at an applied load 640 kN. At this applied load (640 kN), the flexural crack started to propagate upward in this region. The lower layer reinforcing bar yielded at S5 at an applied load 700 kN. Strain gauges S5, and

82

S6 were unstable beyond 700 kN applied load. In addition, the strain gauge S2 was defective at the beginning of the test.

4.4.4 Beam US1-2-2.0 The load versus central deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure are shown in Figures 4.19 and 4.20 respectively. Flexural cracks started to develop from the bottom surface of the beam in the region below the loading point at applied load 550 kN. As the applied load increased to 600 kN, the crack started to propagate upward. Then the crack width increased with increasing the applied load. Another cracks to the right of the loading point developed at an applied load of 750 kN and the beam failed at an applied load 780 kN. It can be seen from Fig. 4.20 that only one single major flexural crack developed, below the loading point where the maximum moment occurred. It can be seen from Fig. 4.19 that the central deflection at the ultimate load was 6.15 mm and the maximum deflection at failure, was 9.27 mm.

Fig. 4.21 shows the load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US1-2-2.0. The strains at most of the gauges were proportionally linear with the applied load. The strain gauges S1 and S5 were higher than S7 due to the crack that developed in the vicinity of the gauges. The reinforcing steel bar yielded at S5, S1, S6, and S7 with applied loads of 601, 693, 732, and 736 kN respectively.

Flexural cracks started to develop from the bottom surface of the beam in the region below the loading point at applied load 600 kN. As the applied load increased to 680 kN, the crack started to propagate upward. Then the crack width increased with increasing the applied load to 800 kN. Another cracks started to develop at the mid depth between the support and the loading point at applied load between 780 and 820 kN. The beam failed at an applied load 882 kN. It can be seen from Fig. 4.21 that only one single major flexural crack developed, below the loading point where the maximum moment occurred. It can be noted from Fig. 4.22 that the central deflection at the ultimate load was 4.96 mm and the maximum deflection at failure was 7.79 mm. In addition, the load versus central deflection was proportionally linear up to applied load 800 kN.

The load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US1-2-1.5 is shown in Fig. 4.24. Most of the strain gauge readings were proportionally linear up to an applied load of 700 kN. The strain gauge S5 was higher than the others due to the crack that developed in the vicinity of the gauge. The reinforcing steel bar yielded at S5, S1, and S2 at applied loads of 775, 796 and 874 kN respectively.

Inclined cracks started to develop in the left span at the mid depth of the beam at applied load 170 kN. As the applied load increased, another crack started to develop in the left span at load 200 kN as shown in the Fig. 4.26. These cracks began to propagate to the bottom surface of the beam and to the loading point at the same time. The crack width increased and the beam failed in shear at applied load 284 kN. The central deflection increased linearly with applied load up to 279.42 kN even after the cracks formed and propagated to the loading point, and to the bottom of the beam. Then a sudden drop in the deflection at load 279.42 kN followed by increasing the load up to 284.05 kN at which the beam failed. The maximum deflection at failure was 4.63 mm.

Fig. 4.27 show the load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US2-0-3.0-a. Most of the strain gauges readings were proportionally linear up to an applied load of 280 kN. The strain gauge S1 significantly increased at an applied load of 195 kN due to the inclined crack that developed in the vicinity of the gauge. It can be observed from Fig. 4.27 that the reinforcing steel
88

bar did not reach the yield point at all gauges. In addition, the reading of strain gauge C3, which is at the mid-depth of the beam, was almost zero. This indicates that the neutral axis was at the mid depth of the beam.

4.4.7 Beam US2-0-3.0-b The behaviour of beam US2-0-3.0-b was similar to beam US2-0-3.0-a as shown in Figures 4.28 and 4.29. The beam failed at an applied load 294.5 kN. The load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US2-0-3.0-b is shown in Fig. 4.30. It can noted that the strain gauge S2 significantly started to increase at applied load 100 kN due to the inclined cracks that formed in the vicinity of the gauge, and the steel bar yielded at an applied load of 256 kN.

4.4.8 Beam US2-1-3.0 The load versus deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure are shown in Figures 4.31 and 4.32 respectively. Diagonal tension crack started to develop in the left span at the mid depth of the beam at applied load 580 kN. This crack started to propagate to the loading point, and to the bottom of the beam as the applied load increased to 650 kN. At the same time, another crack started to develop at the mid depth of the beam, and to the right of first crack. These cracks connected together at applied load 680 kN. The crack width started to increase as the applied load increased until the beam failed in shear at applied load 789.72 kN as shown in Fig. 4.32. The load versus deflection relationship was almost linear up to an applied load of 680 kN. However, when the width of shear cracks started to increase, the load versus deflection relationship became nonlinear. The maximum deflection at failure was 8.22 mm.

The load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US2-1-3.0 is shown in Figure 4.33. Similarly to previous beams, the strains at most of the gauges were proportionally linear up to an applied load of 680 kN. The strain gauges S5 and S6 reached the yield point at applied load 679 and 735 kN respectively. The strain gauge C1 was lower than C2 due to the crushing of the
92

concrete surface at C1. Therefore, the reading of C1 was not reflecting the actual concrete strain and was disregarded.

Figure 4.33 Load versus reinforcement strain Â­ Beam US2-1-3.0

4.4.9 Beam US2-1.5-3.0 The crack behaviour of beam US2-1.5-3.0 was different from US2-1-3.0. Flexural cracks started to develop at applied load 550 kN at the center region of the beam as shown in Fig. 4.35. As the applied load increased to 700 kN, diagonal shear crack started to develop at the mid depth of the beam in left span. This shear crack propagated upward and downward diagonally. Another shear crack formed between the first inclined crack and the loading point when the applied load reached 860 kN. At this point, the width of the flexural cracks started to increase. As the applied load increased the second shear crack started to propagate rapidly to the loading point and to the bottom of the beam until the beam failed in shear at applied load 911.58 kN. The location of shear crack in beam US2-1.5-3.0 was close to the loading point and different from beam US2-13.0. This can be attributed to the high shear capacity in this beam due to high percentage of steel
93

fibres compared to beam US2-1-3.0. The load versus deflection relationship was similar to previous beams. It was almost linear up to an applied load of 780 kN as shown in Fig. 4.34. The maximum deflection at failure was 10.64 mm.

The load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US2-1.5-3.0 is shown in Fig. 4.36. Similarly to previous beams, the strains at most of the gauges were proportionally linear up to an applied load of 780 kN. The strain gauges S5 and S3 reached the yield point at applied load 768, and 827 kN respectively. The strain gauge C1 was damaged at the beginning of the test due to crushing of the concrete surface at the gauge location.

4.4.10 Beam US2-2-3.0 The load versus deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure are shown in Figures 4.37 and 4.38 respectively. Flexural cracks started to develop at the mid span of the beam under the loading point at applied load 450 kN. As the applied load increased, the flexural cracks started to propagate upward and crack width increased until the beam failed in flexural at applied load 950.13 kN. There was no evidence of forming shear cracks in this beam. It can be observed that increasing the fibre volume percentage to 2% significantly increase the shear capacity; however, the flexural capacity was slightly increased. Similar to beam US2-1.5-3, the load versus
95

deflection relationship was almost linear up to an applied load of 680 kN. The maximum deflection at failure was 10.15 mm.

The load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam US2-2-3.0 is shown in Figure 4.39. Similarly to previous beams, the strain readings of most of the gauges were proportionally linear up to an applied load of 780 kN. The strain gauges S5 and S3 reached the yield point at an applied load of 702, and 945 kN respectively. The strain gauge C1 was damaged at the beginning of the test due to crushing of the concrete surface at the gauge location.

4.4.11 Beams NS2 and HS2 Figures 4.40 and 4.41 show the load versus central deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure respectively for beam NS2-0-3. Inclined cracks started to develop in the left span at the mid depth of the beam at an applied load of 165 kN. In addition, cracks began to develop along the lower layer of reinforcing bars due to dowel action mechanism combined with bond failure at the steel concrete interface. As the load increased, the crack started to propagate to the bottom surface of the beam and the loading point at the same time. Additional cracks developed in the shear span before the crack width increased and the beam failed at applied load 250 kN. From Fig. 4.40, it can be seen that the central deflection increased linearly, and it was proportional to
97

the load up to a load of 165 kN where the first crack developed in the left span. Beyond this point, the relationship between the load and central deflection was nonlinear. At failure, the maximum deflection of the beam was 5.01 mm. It was observed from the Fig. 4.40 that the failure mode is brittle.

Figure 4.42 shows the load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam NS2. It can be noted from Fig. 4.42 that the strains gauge S2 was very high due to the inclined cracks that developed in the vicinity of the gauge.

Figure 4.42 Load versus reinforcement strain Â­ Beam NS2-0-3

The load versus central deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure for beam HS2 are shown in Figures 4.43 and 4.44 respectively. The load versus central deflection relationship of beam HS2 was similar to that of beam NS2. However, the crack pattern of beam HS2 was slightly different from that of beam NS2, the inclined cracks were closer in beam HS2 than that of beam NS2.

The load versus the reinforcement strain relationship for beam HS2 is shown in Fig. 4.45. It can be noted from Fig. 4.45 that the strains gauges S1 and S2 started to increase rapidly when the applied load reached 145 kN due to the inclined cracks that began to form in the vicinity of the gauges.

4.5 Comparison of response of UHPFRC beams
4.5.1 Crack pattern and mode of failure All of the beams in series 1 failed in flexure, except the beam without fibre content failed in shear. Flexural cracks began to develop from the bottom surface of the beam in the region below the loading point. As the applied load increased, more cracks developed in the region below the loading point where the maximum moment occurred. These cracks became connected as the load increased and the beam failed. Table 4.5 shows the initial cracking load, ultimate failure load, and the mode of failure for all beams in series 1 and 2. Beams in series 2 failed in shear except beam US2-2-3 failed in flexure. For beams failed in shear, inclined cracks began to develop in the left span at the mid depth of the beam. As the load increased, another crack began to develop in the left span. These cracks began to propagate to the bottom surface of the beam and to the loading point simultaneously. The crack width increased and the beam failed in shear.

4.5.2 Load-deflection response At each loading step, the deflections were measured by one potentiometer installed at the midspan of the beams in series 1 and two potentiometers installed on each side of the beams in series 2. These measured deflections were then compared. The central deflection curves of the beams with 2% fibre volume fraction in series 1 can be seen in Fig. 4.46. Figure 4.47 illustrates the central deflection curves of the beams in series 2. These figures show that the deflection of the beams increased linearly, and was proportional to the applied load, even after the initiation of cracks. The addition of steel fibres increased the ductility of the UHPC beams. The maximum deflection of beams US2-0-3-a, US2-0-3-b, US2-1-3, US2-1.5-3, and US2-2-3 at failure were 4.65, 5.23, 8.22, 10.64, and 10.15 mm respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4.47 that the behaviour of UHPC beam without addition of fibre was similar to the behaviour of NSC and HSC beams with slightly higher strength due to the high compressive strength of UHPC material compared to NSC and HSC materials. This demonstrates that UHPC without fibres is a brittle
102

material, and that increasing the compressive strength of the concrete will not enhance the shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams. It was noted from Fig. 4.47 that beams US2-2-3 and US21.5-3 showed similar behaviour. This behaviour can be attributed to maximum flexural capacity of the beams in series 2.

Figure 4.46 Load versus central deflection relationship for a/d ratio for Series 1 with 2% fibre volume content

4.5.3 Shear capacity Table 4.6 show that the shear capacity of UHPFRC was significantly increased by increases in fibre volume percentage. It can be noted that that the ultimate shear capacity of UHPFRC beams with 1% and 1.5% fibre volume content is 1.7, and 2.13 times higher than the shear capacity of the UHPC without fibre content.

Chapter 5 Experimental Results of UHPFRC- NSC/HSC Members

This chapter describes the material tests conducted in this experimental program and provides details on the analytical procedure used to study the structural behaviour of the UHPFRC composite members. To study the specimen's structural behaviour, including, its load Â­ deflection relationship, reinforcement strains, crack pattern, and concrete strains in the critical shear span, each beam was analysed separately. In addition, this chapter compares the responses of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC specimens with that of the UHPFRC specimens to better understand the composite action between UHPFRC material and NSC/HSC material.

5.1 Cylinder compressive strength
Results from the concrete cylinder compressive strength tests are shown in Table 5.1. For composite beams, the letters N and H indicate the result for NSC and HSC layer respectively, and the letter U indicates the result of UHPFRC layer.

5.3 Flexural tests
The average peak load and average failure load for UHPFRC/NSC (UN) and UHPFRC/HSC (UH) prisms were calculated according to equation (3.2) and summarized in Table 5.3. The peak load and peak deflection are the peak load and its corresponding deflection while the failure load and the failure deflection are the loads where the prism failed and its corresponding deflection. The average peak load was calculated by obtaining the mean of all deflections at peak loads. The average peak load is the load corresponding to average deflection that was calculated by interpolating the two nearest points on the load-deflection curves. Similar procedure was used to calculate the average failure load and its corresponding deflection.

106

The flexural toughness is the total area under the load-deflection curve up to failure. Table 5.4 shows the flexural toughness number rounded to the nearest Joule, and the modulus of rupture f r , which was determined by flexural members that had dimensions of 152 x 152 x 456 mm. It can be noted from Table 5.4 that the flexural toughness increased with the addition of steel fibres to UHPFRC layer.

The cracking behaviour of UHPFRC/NSC (UN) and UHPFRC/HSC (UH) prisms are shown in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 respectively. Figures 5.3 and 5.4 show the load versus net deflection relationship for the UN, and UH, series respectively. The average peak load for UN prisms with 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibres volume content were 50.32, 68.39 and 77.76 kN respectively, while for the average peak load for UH prisms with 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibres volume content were 54.49, 57.76 and 66.39 kN respectively . The average peak load for NSC prisms was 40.84 kN and for HSC prisms was 37.58 kN. It can be noted that the average ultimate load for NSC prisms was slightly higher than the average ultimate load for HSC prisms. This can be attributed to high brittleness of HSC prisms compared to NSC prisms that made the cracks to propagate faster in HSC prisms compared to NSC prisms. The results show (Fig. 5.3) that the addition of UHPFRC layer with 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibres volume content at the bottom of the UN prisms increased the flexural capacity by 23%, 68%, and 90% respectively. While for UH prisms, the addition of UHPFRC layer with 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibres volume content at the bottom of the UH prisms increased the flexural capacity by 45%, 54%, and 77% respectively.

A comparison between UN and UH prism specimens show that the compressive strength of the NSC or HSC layer had no significant effect on the flexural capacity of composite prisms. However, increasing the steel fibre percentage in the UHPFRC layer significantly improved the flexural strength of the concrete prisms. This can be attributed to the fact that when the fibre percentage increased, the fibre concentration in the vicinity of the crack increased, providing effective stress transfer across the crack. It was noted during the tests of composite prisms that the crack propagated very fast when reached the NSC or HSC layer. This can be attributed to the effect of fibres that bridging the crack, delay the propagation of the macro cracks in the UHPFRC layer.

Furthermore, the addition of UHPFRC layer with 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibres volume content at the bottom of the UN prisms significantly enhanced the ductility by 3.4, 4.6, and 5.3 times respectively compared to NS prism respectively. While for UH prism specimens, the addition of
108

UHPFRC layer with 1%, 1.5% and 2% fibre volume content at the bottom of the UH prisms enhanced the ductility by 3.8, 3.9, and 4.3 times respectively compared to HS prism.

It was observed that addition of steel fibres significantly improved the toughness of the prisms as shown in Table 5.4. For instance, UN and UH prisms with 1% fibres showed approximately 8 and 16 times higher toughness than that of NS and HS prisms respectively.

5.4 Behaviour of beam tests
The initial cracking load, ultimate failure load, and deflection at peak load are summarized in Table 5.5.

5.4.1 Beams UNS3-1, UNS3-1D and UNS3-1S For Beams UNS3-1, UNS3-1D and UNS3-1S, the load versus central deflection relationship and crack pattern after failure are shown in Figures 5. 5 - 5.10 respectively. All beams failed in shear due to concrete crushing in the compression zone in the NSC portion. Inclined crack was initiated in the left span at the bottom of the NSC layer (mid depth of the beam), and as the applied load increased, the crack propagated to the loading point. As the applied load further increased, another inclined crack started to develop in the left span at the bottom of the NSC layer, and the cracks width increased, and fibres were pulled out of the matrix. Failure occurred as one major diagonal crack in the NSC layer resulted in tensile failure of the beam.

111

The UNS3-1, UNS3-1D and UNS3-1S beams failed at applied loads 436, 402 and 430 kN respectively. The shear capacity of the composite beam was not improved by the presence of dowels and shear stud. This can be attributed to the high bond strength between the UHPFRC and NSC layer because the inclined cracks were did not propagate through the interface between the UHPFRC, and NSC layer.

Figures 5.11 - 5.13 show the load - crack width relationships for beams UNS3-1, UNS3-1D and UNS3-1S respectively. It can be noted from Figures 5.11 - 5.13 that the widths of the crack were significantly smaller in all beams between the UHPFRC, and NSC/HSC layers, and when the inclined cracks started to propagate through the NSC/HSC layer, the crack width increased due to forming of diagonal cracks in NSC or HSC layer. For example, Beam UNS3-1, the crack

115

widths at crack gauges were almost zero up to applied 200 kN, then when the inclined cracks started to develop in the NSC layer, the crack widths started to increase.

5.5 Bond between UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers
The bond between the two different layers of concrete (UHPFRC and NSC/ HSC) was examined using a split tensile test. Bond failure is characterized by failure along the interface surface. Some of the specimens failed in bond along the interface surface and others failed by the splitting the NSC or HSC layer. Bond stress is defined as the shear stress along the interface surface between two materials, and can be calculated from equation (3.3).

The average bond strength of composite cubes with 1%, 1.5%, and 2% fibres volume fractions of UHPFRC-NSC were 11.62, 11.12, 11.97 MPa respectively, while the average bond strength of composite cubes with 1%, 1.5%, and 2% fibres volume fractions of UHPFRC-HSC were 10.57, 12.32 and 12.86 MPa respectively. It should be noted that bond strength at the composite interface is independent on the fibre volume content. Figure 5.61 illustrates failure mode of the composite splitting cubes.

142

Out of all the UHPFRC-NSC specimens, only two specimens with 1.5% fibre volume content failed due to splitting failure in the NSC layer, the remainder of the specimens failed in bond at the UHPFRC-NSC interface. Out of all the UHPFRC-HSC specimens, two specimens with 1% fibre volume content and one specimen with 1.5% fibre volume content failed due to splitting failure in the HSC layer (as shown in Fig. 6d), the remainder of the specimens failed in bond at the UHPFRC-HSC interface. The failure load for the cubes that failed due to splitting failure in the NSC or HSC layer was lower than the failure load of the cubes that failed due to splitting along the UHPFRC-NSC/HSC interface. These cubes were thus eliminated from the calculation of average bond strength for the composite cubes.

5.6 Comparison of response of UHPFRC members
5.6.1 Crack pattern and mode of failure All of the beams in series 3 failed in shear. All of the composite beams failed in shear due to the principal tensile stress in the NSC or HSC layer. The tensile stress in these layers exceeded the tensile strength of the concrete, leading to the development of a diagonal tensile crack in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the principal tensile stress.

The UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams underwent three stages. The first stage was the linear elastic stage in which both layers behaved elastically. The second stage began with the appearance of a diagonal crack that started in the left span at the bottom of the NSC/HSC layer (mid depth of the beam) and propagated to the loading point as the load continued to increase. As the applied load increased, another inclined crack started to develop in the left span at the bottom of the NSC/HSC layer and the width of the cracks increased. The third and final stage took place when one or more cracks in the NSC/HSC layer caused the concrete to crush due to excessive strain, causing failure.

The UHPFRC-NSC beams failed at an applied load of 402 and 520 kN which is 1.6 to 2.0 times higher than the failure load of NSC beam. Similarly, the UHPFRC-HSC beams failed at an applied load of 413 and 522 kN which is 1.7 to 2.0 times higher than the failure load of HSC beam.

The results of the composite beam tests indicate that the compressive strength of the NSC or HSC concrete layer controls the ultimate shear strength of the composite beams. It was observed from the tests that the inclined cracks did not propagate into the UHPFRC layer due to high shear strength of this layer. In addition, the inclined cracks started to propagate higher into the NSC/HSC layer of the beams reinforced with dowels and shear stud. Tables 5.6 and 5.7 illustrate that the shear capacity of composite beams was not improved by the presence of dowels and shear studs with the exception of the composite beam with 1.5% fibre volume content. This can
144

be attributed to the bond strength between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers preventing the inclined cracks from propagating through the interface between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers. It was observed from the load - crack width relationships for the composite beams that the crack width of all beams was significantly smaller between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers and increased as the cracks began to propagate through the NSC/HSC layer. For example, in beam UNS3-2, the crack gauges was almost zero up to an applied load of 300 kN. When the inclined cracks began to develop in the NSC layer, the crack width began to increase. In addition, the crack width began to increase early on composite beams with 1%, and 1.5% fibre volume content, while the crack width of the beams with 2% fibre volume content began to increase at loads above 200 kN.

5.6.2 Load-deflection response The central deflection curves of the beams in series 2 and 3 can be seen in Figures 5.62-5.69. The central deflection of the UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams was higher than the central deflection of the NSC/HSC beams due to the high ductility of the composite beams compared to NSC/HSC beams. In addition, the deflection of the beams increased in a linear fashion and was proportional to the applied load, even after the initiation of cracks.

The load-deflection curves of all the composite beams showed similar behaviour and were not significantly influenced by the fibre volume content or the presence of shear connectors, with the exception of the UHPFRC/HSC beams with 1.5% and 2% fibre volume content. The beams were able to carry the applied load and the stiffness was not degraded after the initiation of the inclined cracks. This behaviour can be attributed to the high stiffness of the UHPFRC layer supporting the NSC/HSC layer.

The maximum deflection of beams UNS3-1, UNS3-1D, UNS3-1S, UNS3-1.5, UNS3-1.5D, UNS3-2, UNS3-2D at failure were 6.15, 5.55, 6.46, 7.66, 6.41, 6.63, and 7.24 mm respectively, and for UHS3-1, UHS3-1D, UHS3-1S, UHS3-1.5, UHS3-1.5D, UHS3-2, UHS3-2D at failure were 8.81, 9.69, 6.84, 5.75, 7.06, 7.34, 11.14 mm. It was observed from the test results that some
145

beams were able to carry the load after the crushing of the NSC or HSC layer at the left side of the beam, and showed higher deflection. This can be attributed to the strut mechanism that the load transfer to the UHPFRC layer due to the fact that the right side of the beam was still able to carry the load and the NSC or HSC on the right side was still able to transfer the load to the UHPFRC layer.

A comparison between the UHPFRC beams with UHPFRC-NSC beams with different fibre volume contents are shown in Figures 6.70 Â­ 6.72. It can be noted that the ultimate shear capacity of UHPFRC-NSC beams was 50% of the ultimate shear capacity of UHPFRC beams. However, the ductility of UHPFRC-NSC beams was similar to UHPFRC beams for beams with 1.5% and 2% fibre volume content. This shows that the addition of NSC or HSC layer significantly decreases the ultimate shear capacity of the UHPFRC beams due to the low shear capacity of NSC and HSC layers.

5.6.3 Shear capacity Tables 5.6 and 5.7 show the shear capacity of composite beams compared to NSC or HSC beam. It can be noted the ultimate shear capacity of UHPFRC/NSC beams is 1.6 to 2.0 times higher than the resistance of the NSC beam and the ultimate shear capacity of UHPFRC/HSC beams is 1.7 to 2.0 times higher than the resistance of the HSC beam. It is evident that the improvement in the shear behaviour of the composite beam was due to the addition of the UHPFRC layer in the tension zone. Even with a low fibre volume content of 1%, the shear resistance of the UHPFRCNSC beam was 60% greater than the shear resistance of the NSC beam. Increasing the fibre volume content to 2% resulted in shear resistances that were at least double the resistance of the NSC/HSC beam.

The test results show that the addition of dowels or shear studs did not significantly enhance the ultimate shear capacity of the composite beams. This is due to high bond strength between the NSC/HSC and UHPFRC layers. The results also revealed that increasing the compressive strength from 51 MPa to 70MPa did not enhance the shear capacity of the composite beams.

Chapter 6 Analytical Modeling of UHPFRC & UHPFRC- NSC/HSC Members

This chapter presents the proposed models to predict the structural behaviour of UHPFRC and UHPFRC Â­ NSC/HSC members without shear reinforcement. Section 6.1 compares the experimental results with previous models and recommendations. Section 6.2 presents a method for predicting the shear strength of UHPFRC beams. Section 6.3 describes an analytical model to predict the flexural behaviour of UHPFRC members. Section 6.4 presents a method for predicting the shear strength of UHPFRC Â­ NSC/HSC members without shear reinforcement.

6.1 Comparisons with previous models and recommendations
The experimental results of series 2 and the results obtained in previous research (Yang et al.
2012, Baby et al. 2010) were compared to the models proposed by other researchers in order to

investigate their ability to adequately predict the shear strength of UHPFRC beams. The results indicate that the models proposed by Aouda et al. (2012), Khuntia et al. (1999), Kwak et al. (2002), Narayanan and Darwish (1987), Ashour et al. (1992), JSCE recommendation (2008), and French recommendation (2002) led to under prediction of the shear strength. In addition, the ACI-318-11, Eurocode 2 EN 1992-1-1:2004 and CSA A23.3-04 which is the same model proposed by Aouda et al. without fibres were unable to predict the shear capacity of UHPC beam without fibres.

6.2 Predicting the shear strength of UHPFRC
This section describes the proposed model to predict the shear strength of UHPFRC without shear reinforcement. In this model, an idealized crack represents a critical flexural-shear crack that often observed in fibre reinforced concrete beams that have failed in shear. This inclined crack forms an angle of  from the beam's longitudinal axis and is assumed to extend from the outer face of the tension surface to the location of the neutral axis. The present model ignores the shear deformation of the beam compression zone that causes sliding along the critical crack prior
154

to failure. Therefore, the shear resistance along the inclined crack is resisted by the dowel action of the longitudinal steel reinforcement, and fibre tension. The contribution of dowel action to the shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams was investigated by previous researchers (Singh et al., 2012, Jeli et al., 1999). The results revealed that the diameter of the bar has no effect on the load-carrying capacity of the reinforced concrete members; therefore, the contribution of dowel action to shear resistance is unlikely to be a significant factor in the internal load-transfer mechanism leading to final collapse. Shear resistance along the inclined crack is thus assumed to be a result of fibre tension only.

It was found that the fibre distribution of UHPFRC tend to align in the direction perpendicular to the direction of flow for panel specimens with small thickness (Barnett et al., 2010). The fibre will thus align in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the beam. In the present model,  is assumed to be 0.5 for rectangular cross sections and 1 /  for I

sections ( b  50mm ) due to the narrow width of web in I sections. More research is necessary in order to determine the fibre orientation factor for I sections with a small thickness to height ratio. Thus, the "effective" number of fibres per unit area for rectangular sections is as follows:

The pullout strength of a single fibre can be obtained from equation (6.5) assuming the maximum embedment length is

(6.5)

where  is the efficiency of a single fibre which depends of the angle of the fibre to the direction of fibre loading. This factor has been studied by numerous researchers Maage (1977); Naaman and Shah (1976); Rasmussen (1997). The results showed that the fibres are fully efficient at angles between 0Â° and 75Â°; however, there is a significant decrease in efficiency when the angle is higher than 75Â°. The average fibre angle to the fibre loading direction for UHPFRC was reported to be between 40Â° and 75Â°, depending on the distance from the base of the specimen and the casting procedure (Barnett et al., 2010). Therefore, in the present model, the fibre efficiency was assumed to be 1. There was a promising correlation between this assumption and the experimental results obtained in this study (Table 6.1).

For UHPFRC beams, the contribution of concrete to ultimate shear strength is small. In addition, it is assumed that the contribution of the fibre in the concrete cover is negligible; therefore, it can

158

be assumed that (h  c)  d v . By substitute equation (6.4) and (6.5) into (6.2), the shear resistance provided by the fibres is:

which represent fibre typology (Minelli, 2005), d v  max( 0.72h,0.9d ) (CSA

particle packing density (Orange el al.1999, Wille and Naaman 2013). Thus, in the present model, the average bond strength  is assumed to be 10 MPa. The critical inclined crack angle of beams that failed in shear  was between 40Â° and 45Â°. Yang et al. (2012) found that the critical angle  was around 45Â°; therefore, in order to be conservative, the average angle of the critical inclined cracks was assumed 45Â°. The shear contribution of the compression zone above the neutral axis can be determined from the experimental results obtained from UHPC beams. The ultimate shear force, Vu , resisted by the test beams in the left span can be calculated as follows:

Vu 

Pu ( L  a) L

(6.7)

where, L is the length of the beam, a is the shear span, and

Pu is the ultimate applied load. The

ultimate shear strength, Vu , resisted by the test beams without fibres in the left span is assumed due to the contribution of compression region only; therefore, Vu in equation (6.7) is equivalent to

Vc

in equation (6.1). As seen in Fig. 6.2, the behaviour of UHPC beam without the addition of

fibre was similar to the behaviour of NSC beam with slightly higher strength due to the high compressive strength of UHPC material compared to NSC material. Thus Vc proposed in the
159

ACI code (ACI 318-11, 2011) can be modified based on the experimental results in this study as following:
M *d  Vc  (0.24 f c  17.2  w * ) * bw * d v V

(6.8)

where,

f c  concrete compressive strength,  w is the longitudinal steel reinforcement ratio, d is

the effective depth of beam, and d v is the effective shear depth .

The accuracy of the proposed model was verified using the experimental results obtained in this study as well as the experimental results obtained by Yang et al. (2012) and Baby et al. (2010) as shown in Table 6.1. As seen in this table, there is good agreement between the predicted shear capacities and the experimental results, with a standard deviation Vu pred / Vu exp equal to 0.063.

In order to determine the uniform fibre reinforced concrete stress in tension, f ft , 152 x 152 x 457 mm fibre reinforced concrete prisms with different steel fibre volume percentages, Vsf were tested. Sectional analysis for the prisms can be conducted using an iteration procedure to determine the location of the neutral axis and uniform fibre reinforced concrete stress in tension,

As seen in this table, there is good agreement between the predicted flexural capacities and the experimental results, with a standard deviation Mu / Muexp equal to 0.064.

6.4 Predicting the shear strength of UHPFRC Â­ NSC/HST composite beams
This section describes the proposed model to predict the shear strength of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams without shear reinforcement. In this model, an idealized crack represents a critical shear crack that develops in the NSC/HSC layer of fibre reinforced concrete composite beams that have failed in shear. This inclined crack forms at an angle of  from the beam's longitudinal axis and is assumed to extend from the interface between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers to the location of the neutral axis. The present model ignores the shear
163

deformation of the beam compression zone that causes sliding along the critical crack prior to failure. In addition, the contribution of dowel action to shear resistance is neglected due to small contribution of dowel action to shear resistance. Therefore, The shear resistance of a UHPFRCNSC/HSC beam can be equivalent to the expected shear resistance of a NSC/HSC beam without shear reinforcement,

Vc , plus the additional shear resistance provided by the fibres, V f , due to

the improved post-cracking resistance of the UHPFRC layer as shown Fig. 6.4. The shear strength of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams can be calculated from equation (6.1) as shown in Fig. 6.4.

Figure 6.4 Fibre contributions to shear resistance

The shear resistance provided by the fibres,

Vf

, can be obtained as follows:

V f  b * hu * f fib * n fib

(6.15)

where hu is the thickness of UHPFRC layer.
164

The pullout strength of a single fibre can be obtained from equation (6.5) assuming the maximum embedment length is

, and



is assumed to be 10 MPa. The contribution of

concrete to ultimate shear strength is small; therefore, it can be assumed that

(d  c)  d v where

d v  max( 0.72h,0.9d ) (CSA Standard A23.3-04, 2004). In addition, it is assumed that the
contribution of the fibre in the concrete cover is negligible. Thus, the shear resistance provided by the fibres is:

V f  F * * b * (d  hn )

(6.16)

where

Vsf l f hn is the thickness of NSC/HSC layer, and . The shear contribution by F df

compression zone above the neutral axis can be determined from the proposed equation by the ACI-318-11:

M *d  Vc  (0.16 f c  17.2  w * ) * b * dv V

(6.17)

The proposed model was verified with the experiment results obtained in this study. The results can be seen in Table 6.3. As seen in this table, there is good agreement between the predicted shear capacities and the experimental results, with a standard deviation of 0.85 for Vu pred / Vu exp .

Chapter 7 Finite Element Analysis

To define the limits of the applicability of the proposed model, a wide range of experimental program is required. However, the material cost of UHPFRC is extremely expensive in comparison with normal and high strength concrete. Finite element (FE) methods serve as strong analytical tool to further investigate size effect and to calculate the response of composite members. Thus, FE method is used to perform further investigations on the parameters that affect the shear behaviour of UHPFRC members.

In this chapter, the material behaviour of UHPFRC is modeled by introducing a suitable tension stiffening model to simulate the tension behaviour of UHPFRC beams in tension. The finite element model is developed based on the smeared cracking approach adopting a plasticity-based concrete model. The validity of the proposed model was established through comparison with the results of the experimental test program in this study and with experimental results conducted by other researches.

7.1 Description of finite element model
Despite the significant amount of constitutive models that developed to represent the mechanical behaviour of reinforced concrete members (Chen 1982; Hillerborg et al. 1976; Lubliner et al. 1989; Lee and Fenves 1998), no accurate constitutive model of UHPFRC mechanical response is available in the finite element solutions for structural analysis of UHPFRC members. Therefore, a new model to represent the mechanical behaviour of UHPFRC is required.

In ABAQUS, two concrete constitutive models readily available; concrete smeared cracking (CSC) model and the concrete damaged plasticity (CDP) model. Chen and Graybeal (2012)
167

showed that CDP is more suitable to simulate the mechanical behaviour of UHPFRC girders. Mahmud et al. (2013) showed that the CDP model is suitable to simulate the size effect of UHPFRC. Therefore, in this study, the CDP model is adopted to predict the actual behaviour of UHPFRC beams.

The concrete damaged plasticity (CDP) model in ABAQUS was proposed by Lubliner et al. (1989) for monotonic loading; then Lee and Fenves (1998) developed further the CDP model to consider the dynamic and cyclic loadings. The model assumes isotropic damaged elasticity combined with isotropic tensile and compressive plasticity to represent the inelastic behaviour of concrete. A softening stress-strain relationship is adopted to represent the formation of tensile micro cracks and a stress hardening followed by a strain softening beyond the ultimate compressive strength to represent the compressive plastic response. In addition, the tensile and compressive stiffness degradation of material and the recovery effects have been considered in this model.

The CDP model is smeared crack model which means the individual micro crack is not considered and the constitutive characteristic calculations are preformed independently at each integration point of the finite element analysis and the response in tension is described as a continuum in terms of stressÂ­strain relations. This model include the compression hardening, tension stiffening, yield function and plastic flow of the material.

7.2 Material properties
7.2.1 Material properties of steel In the present study, classical metal plasticity model in ABAQUS was adopted to define the behaviour of steel reinforcement up to failure. The stress-strain curve for steel was plotted based on the principles of strain hardening by Park and Paulay (1974). The young modulus Poisson's ratio

Es

and

 s for steel reinforcement was assumed to be 200 GPa and 0.3 respectively. In
168

ABAQUS, the true stress-plastic strain relationship must be used to define the plastic behaviour of metal plasticity. The nominal stress-strain diagram that can be obtained from uniaxial stressstrain test must be converted to true stress-strain diagram as shown in Fig. 7.1 and equation (7.1), then the plastic behaviour for the classical metal plasticity model must be used as an input in ABAQUS as shown in Fig. 7.2, and equation (7.2)

7.2.2 Material properties of UHPFRC The nonlinear behaviour of UHPFRC is divided into two regions: compression and tension. The material property in compression is straightforward and was obtained from the compression cylinder tests data. The tension stiffening of UHPFRC was calibrated with the experimental
3 results in this study. The concrete density was assumed to be 2565 kg / m (Chen et al., 2012).

The Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were assumed to be 47 GPa and 0.20 respectively.

The uniaxial behaviour in ABAQUS must be defined as the stress-cracking strain or displacement for tensile behaviour and the stress-inelastic strain for compressive behaviour. The inelastic/cracking strains can be calculated according to ABAQUS user's manuals (2010) as follows:

curve for UHPFRC is shown in Fig. 7.3, and the compression inelastic behaviour, compression damage parameter in CDP model are shown in Figs 7.4, and 7.5 respectively.

7.2.2.1 Tension stiffening Cracking is one of prime importance in the nonlinear behaviour of reinforced concrete elements. When the tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of concrete, a crack is formed in the direction normal to the direction of the tensile stress. At the crack the load is carried by the reinforcement only whereas between the cracks the load is shared between steel reinforcement and concrete. This ability of concrete between cracks to share the tensile load with the reinforcement is termed "tension stiffening". Thus, while the concrete stress is zero at the cracks, the average stress over a cracked region is not zero. Cracking occurs in the concrete when the tensile stress at a given location exceeds its tensile strength and it is manifested by a separation of the concrete at this location.

Tension stiffening in CDP can be defined as uniaxial stress-cracking strain relationship, stressfracture energy relationship or stress-displacement relationship. The experimental data obtained from dog-bone specimens by Mahmud et al. (2013) show that the complete fracture occurred at a strain

 cut  0.04 . Based on dog-bone tests for UHPFRC specimens by Wille et al. (2011) and

Mahmud et al. (2013), the tension stiffening in the present study was described as uniaxial stresscracking strain relationship, which is elastic-plastic with linear strain hardening to simulate the post cracking behaviour of UHPFRC, then softening occurs until complete fracture at a strain

 cut  0.04 . The input parameters for UHPFRC (with different fibre volume percentages) that
includes inelastic tension behaviour and tension damage in CDP model are shown in Figs. 7.6 and 7.7 respectively.

7.2.2.2 Yield surface definition The yield surface function in the CDP model is based on the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. This function was originally developed by Lubliner et al. (1989) for monotonic loading, and then modified by Lee and Fenves (1998) to consider the dynamic and cyclic loadings. In ABAQUS, the parameters that define the yield surface function is the ratio of initial equibiaxial compressive yield stress to the initial uniaxial compressive yield stress, ratio of the second stress invariant on the tensile meridian to that on the compressive meridian, and a viscosity parameter that defines viscoplastic regularization. These default values are set to 1.16, 2/3, and 0.0 respectively. The ratio of the second stress invariant on the tensile meridian to that on the compressive meridian

K c by default is 2/3 making the yield criterion approach Rankine's yield criteria (Pankaj 2010).
The maximum value of K c is 1.0 making the yield criterion approach Drucker-Prager yield criterion as shown in Fig 7.8. In the present study the default value of K c (2/3) was adopted in the analysis.

K c , (Hibbitt et al., 2011)

175

7.2.2.3 Plastic flow rule The plastic flow rule function in CDP model is a Drucker-Prager hyperbolic plastic potential function. The purpose of this function is to connect between the yield surface and the uniaxial stress-strain relationships (Malm 2009). In ABQUS, two parameters used to define the flow rule; dilation angle and eccentricity. The dilation angle controls the amount of plastic volumetric strain that can be developed during plastic shearing which is assumed to be constant during
  plastic yielding. The default value of the dilation angle is between 35 and 40 (Malm 2009).

For ductile material, the value of dilation angle is high, while for brittle material the value of dilation angle is low. The eccentricity parameter defines the rate at which the flow rule function approaches the asymptote; the default value is 0.1 which implies the material has the same dilation angle over a wide range of confining pressure stress values. In the present study the
 dilation angle and eccentricity were assumed to be 39 and 0.1 respectively.

The material properties of steel reinforcement and UHPFRC material models used in the FE model are presented in tables 7.1 and 7.2 respectively. For all other parameters, the default values have been used.

7.3 Finite element mesh and geometry description
The concrete in all the beams was modeled by eight node continuum elements with reduced integration (C3D8R), and the steel reinforcement was modelled by 3-node quadratic 3-D truss element (T3D3). The three dimension FE model is shown in Fig. 7.9. The load was applied as a pressure over the central area of the beam to avoid hourglass problem as shown in Fig. 7.10. To simulate the bond between steel reinforcement and surrounding concrete, reinforcement in concrete has been modeled as embedded discrete truss elements tied to the concrete region by assuming perfect bond between the reinforcement and the concrete. In the present analysis, no bond-slip model was considered. Mesh convergence was studied with three mesh sizes 40 mm, 30 mm and 20 mm for beam US2-1.5-3.0. It was found that the latter two led to virtually identical results as shown in Fig. 7.11; therefore, 30 mm mesh size was adopted in this study.

7.4.3 Verification with experimental results of beam Yang et al. (2012) The measured central deflection and the crack patterns of beams S34-F15-P0 and S34-F20-P0 (Yang et al., 2012) for 1.5% and 2% fibre volume content were compared with the present FE model as shown in Figs 7.15 and 7.16 respectively. Good agreement between the FE model and the experimental results by Yang et al. was obtained in this study as seen in Figs 7.15 and 7.16. The comparison of crack patterns obtained using CDP model with the experimental result of beams S34-F20-P0 also show close agreement as shown in Fig. 7.17. This shows that the present model is capable of predicting the shear behaviour of I sections.

7.5 FE model of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams
The finite element model of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams was based on CDP model that was described earlier. Each UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beam is consisted of two materials: UHPFRC material in the lower layer of the beam and NSC or HSC material in the top layer of the beam. The UHPFRC material was described in section 7.2. This section will explain the nonlinear behaviour of NSC and HSC material.

The nonlinear behaviour of NSC or HSC is divided into two regions: compression and tension. The concrete density was assumed to be 2400 kg / m 3 . The Young's modulus was obtained from the following equation Yang et al. (2013):

Ec  8250( f c)

The Poisson's ratio was assumed equal to 0.20.

7.6 Verification of FE model for UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams
To evaluate the capability of the present FE model to simulate the shear behaviour of UHPFRCNSC/HSC beams, the results of the model has been verified with the experimental program in this study. The results of the FE model were compared with the measured central deflection of beam US3-2 as shown in Fig. 7.24. It can be noted from Fig. 7.24 that good agreement between the FE analysis and the experimental results obtained in this study. The comparison of crack patterns obtained using CDP model with the experimental results also show close agreement as shown in Fig. 7.25.

7.7 Parametric study
7.7.1 Size effect of UHPFRC beams To investigate the size effect of UHPFRC beams, FE simulations based on the present CDP model were carried out for beams with 150 x 300 mm, 250 x 500 mm, 300 x 600 mm, and 400 x 1200 mm cross sectional areas. The FE analysis for beam with 150 x 300 mm cross sectional area was verified with the experimental results for beam US2-1.5-3.0 as shown in Fig. 7.11. The steel reinforcement ratio was kept constant to study the effect of beam size on the shear behaviour of UHPFRC beams. The load versus central deflection was compared in Fig. 7.26. Fig. 7.26 shows that the central deflection could go up to 40 mm with beam size 400 x 1200 mm due to high ductility of UHPFRC material. Table 7.3 shows shear capacity comparison for different beam sizes. It can be seen from Table 7.3 that shear capacity was reduced from 1.15 to 0.95 with increasing the beam depth from 300 mm to 1200 mm. This result confirms that the size
191

effect in structures made of UHPFRC material has little influence on the shear capacity. Similar results obtained by Mahmud et al. (2013) and Wille et al. (2012) that showed changes in beam sizes had little influence on the flexural strength.

7.7.2 Size effect of UHPFRC-NSC beams The FE simulations based on the present CDP model were carried out for beams with 150 x 300 mm, 300 x 600 mm, and 400 x 1200 mm cross sectional area to investigate the size effect of UHPFRC-NSC beams. The FE analysis for beam with 150 x 300 mm cross sectional area was verified with the experimental results for beam UNS3-2 as shown in Fig. 7.24. The steel reinforcement ratio was kept constant to study the effect of beam size on the shear behaviour of UHPFRC-NSC beams. It can be noted from the load versus central deflection relationship as shown in Fig. 7.27 that the central deflection could go up to 19 mm with beam size 400 x 1200 mm due to high ductility of UHPFRC material. Table 7.4 shows shear capacity comparison for different beam sizes. It can be seen from Table 7.4 that shear capacity was reduced from 0.60 for beam size 150 x 300 mm to 0.43 for beam size 300 x 600 mm. however, increasing the beam size to 400 x 1200 mm did not result in reduction of shear capacity of UHPFRC-NSC beams.

7.7.3 Compressive strength of NSC/HSC layer A FE analysis was carried on to study the effect of compressive strength of NSC/HSC layer on the shear behaviour of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams as shown in Fig. 7.28. The results show that increasing the compressive strength of concrete layer in compression beyond 51 MPa did not enhance the shear capacity of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams. Furthermore, the beams with 100 MPa of HSC layer show less ductility and the load versus central deflection relationship was linear due the high compressive strength of the concrete in the compression zone. This indicates that using high compressive concrete strength in compression will reduce the ductility of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams due to the increase of the brittleness of concrete layer in compression.

Summary and Conclusions

A comprehensive experimental, analytical and numerical study was carried out to investigate the various mechanical properties of UHPFRC members, and UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite members. The finding can be summarized and conclusions drawn as follow:

8.1 Experimental program
8.1.1 UHPFRC members Twelve prisms 152 x 152 x 533 mm in size constructed using UHPFRC material with different steel fibres content were tested under four-point un-notched bending tests. A total of twelve simply supported UHPFRC beams were tested to failure under a monotonically increased concentrated load. All of the beams have shear span to effective depth ratio between 1.5 and 3.5. These tests examined the influence of steel fibre content on the flexural and shear capacity of UHPFRC members. From series 1 and 2 test results, the following conclusions were made:  Test results showed that the addition of 1% and 1.5% of steel fibres to concrete significantly improved the shear strength of UHPC by 77%, and 120% respectively due to the stresses that develop across the crack surface.  The cracking behaviour of UHPFRC beams in series 2 exhibited a similar pattern. The initial crack was observed to be diagonal in the mid-depth of the shear span. As the applied load increased, additional diagonal cracks were formed within the shear span. Finally, the failure occurred when the fibre pulled-out along the major diagonal crack.  The behaviour of UHPC beam without fibre content shows similar behaviour to NSC beam with slight increase in the shear capacity due to the high compressive strength of UHPC.  The increase of shear span to depth ratio decrease shear strengths. The beam with a shear span to effective depth ratio of 1.5 had more shear capacity than the ratio of 3.5. This
198

could be attributed to the stability of the arch mechanism at lower shear span to effective depth ratios.

8.1.2 UHPFRC-NSC/HSC members Twelve prisms 152 x 152 x 533 mm in size constructed using UHPFRC-NSC/HSC material with different steel fibres contents were tested under four-point un-notched bending tests. The composite UHPFRC-NSC/HSC prisms were made up of 101 mm NSC or HSC layer at the top, and 51 mm UHPC layer at the bottom. A total of fourteen simply supported UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams were tested to failure under a monotonically increased concentrated load. All the beams have shear span to effective depth ratio of 3.0. These tests examined the influence of steel fibre volume percentage and the concrete compressive strength of the top layer on the flexural and shear capacity of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite members. From this series of tests the following conclusions were made:  The addition of UHPFRC layer with 1.5% and 2% fibre volume content at the bottom of the NSC prisms significantly enhanced the flexural capacity by 54%, and 90% respectively compared to NSC prisms.  The average bond strength between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers were between 10.57 and 12.86 MPa. Test results showed that the content of steel fibres in UHPFRC layer did not affect the bond strength at the interface between the UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers.   Test results showed that the ultimate shear capacity of the composite beams were significantly higher than the NSC/HSC beams. The behaviour of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams in series 3 exhibited similar failure mode. The initial crack was observed to be diagonal in the mid-depth of the shear span in the NSC/HSC layer. As the applied load increased, additional diagonal cracks were formed within the shear span. Finally, the failure occurred when the tensile stresses in the NSC/HSC layer exceeds the tensile strength of concrete in the NSC/HSC layer.   The addition of dowels and shear stud was not very effective in enhancing the shear capacity of the composite beam. The composite beams exhibit high ductility compared to NSC/HSC beam.

8.2 Analytical program
Analytical models to predict the flexural and shear behaviour of UHPFRC beams and shear behaviour of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams were developed as shown in Table 8.1.The following conclusions were drawn:  The results of proposed model for predicting the shear capacity based on the average bond strength  for UHPFRC calculated from a single fibre pullout test show good agreement with the experimental tests in this program and by other researchers.  A procedure for predicting the flexural capacity of UHPFRC beams was presented. This method shows good agreement with the experimental test results of this program investigation and with experiments conducted by other researchers.    A model for predicting the shear capacity of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams shows good agreement with the experimental test results of this program. The proposed model allows evaluating the effect of fibre volume content (1%, 1.5%, and 2%) on shear capacity of fibre reinforced concrete beams. A finite element model was developed based on the smeared cracking approach adopting a plasticity-based concrete model. The validity of the proposed model was established through comparison with the results of the experimental test program in this study and with experimental results conducted by other researchers.  The FE model was then carried out for size effect analysis. The results of finite element analysis show that the size effect in structures made of UHPFRC material has little influence on the shear capacity.  Similar to the experimental results, the finite element analysis results show that increasing the compressive strength of HSC concrete layer in compression beyond 51 MPa did not enhance the shear capacity of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams. Furthermore, the beams with 100 MPa of HSC layer show less ductility and the load versus central deflection relationship was linear due the high compressive strength of the concrete in the compression zone. This indicates that using high compressive concrete strength in compression will reduce the ductility of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beams due to the increase of the brittleness of the concrete layer in compression.

A comparison between the finite element analysis and the analytical model for the different UHPFRC and UHPFRC-NSC/HSC composite beam sizes show that the present finite element analysis and the analytical model have very close results. This indicates that both finite element model and the analytical models developed in chapter 6 are capable of predicting the shear behaviour of UHPFRC and UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams.

8.3 Future research
Suggestions for future research are given below: 1- Investigating composite actions with other reinforced concrete members. It was evident that bond strength between UHPFRC and NSC/HSC layers was high; therefore, this composite system can be extended to other structural members such as slabs.

201

2- An experimental program to investigate the reversed cyclic loading response of UHPFRC and UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams. 3- An experimental program to investigate the durability of UHPFRC-NSC/HSC beams such as chloride test, freeze and thaw cycles. 4- Determine the resistance factors of UHPFRC materials through probability study based on experiments to support the analytical data. 5- Determine an effective moment of inertia model that accurately models the behaviour of UHPFRC composite members subjected to shear and bending. 6- Further fibre types could be used to examine the influence of fibre geometry on the structural behaviour of UHPFRC members.
