INVESTIGATION  OF  THE  LIFE  CYCLE  CARBON  IMPACT  OF  PASSIVE  HOUSE   BUILDING  ENVELOPES  IN  CANADA   Master  of  Applied  Science  2015  -  Patrick  Werner  Andres  -  Building  Science  Program   Ryerson  University        

Abstract  
Whole   building   energy   and   life   cycle   impact   modeling   was   conducted   for   a   single- family   detached   reference   building   designed   to   meet   the   Passive   House   Standard.   Life   cycle   operating   global   warming   potential   (GWP)   and   building   envelope   embodied  GWP  were  assessed  for  two  mechanical  system  configurations  and  three   Canadian   cities.   Variations   in   regional   electricity   carbon   intensity   were   found   to   significantly  impact  both  operating  and  embodied  GWP.  Embodied  GWP  was  found   to   be   significant   relative   to   operating   GWP   in   locations   with   access   to   low   carbon   electricity.   Additionally,   use   of   natural   gas   mechanical   systems   in   Edmonton   resulted  in  360%  greater  operating  emissions  than  in  Montreal,  while  electric  heat   pump   mechanicals   yielded   6,600%   higher   emissions.   Finally,   the   Passive   House   Standard   method   for   quantifying   operating   GWP   was   found   to   overestimate   emissions   by   up   to   3700%   in   Montreal   and   underestimate   emissions   by   34%   in   Edmonton,   when   compared   to   a   method   accounting   for   variations   in   regional   electricity  carbon  intensity.

1 Introduction    
The  Passive  House  Standard  for  building  energy  efficiency  has  been  widely  adopted   across  Europe,  with  over  25,000  projects  completed  as  of  2010  (Zeller,  2010).  The   Passive  House  Standard  was  developed  with  the  intention  of  reducing  building   energy  consumption  and  associated  greenhouse  gas  emissions  to  a  rate  that  allows   for  mitigation  of  climate  change  related  to  the  building  sector  (PHIUS,  2013a).   Despite  these  stated  goals,  the  standard  does  not  currently  account  for  the   embodied  global  warming  potential  (GWP)  associated  with  building  materials  nor   does  it  recognize  the  varying  carbon  intensities  of  regional  energy  supply  mixes,   thereby  failing  to  fully  quantify  all  GWP  over  a  building's  entire  life  cycle.     The  research  presented  aims  to  determine  the  impact  of  using  the  Passive   House  Standard  method  for  calculating  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  place  of  a   method  that  accounts  for  regional  variations  in  electricity  emission  intensity.  It  is   also  an  investigation  of  the  impact  that  Passive  House  building  envelope  parameters   and  mechanical  system  fuel  selection  have  on  life  cycle  GWP  for  various  locations   across  Canada.  This  will  assist  Passive  House  designers  in  selecting  mechanical   system  equipment  and  envelope  materials  that  result  in  lower  life  cycle  GWP  and   lay  the  groundwork  for  future  research  assessing  region-specific  trade-offs  of   envelope  and  mechanical  system  parameters.

2 Literature  Review  
2.1 Background  on  the  Passive  House  Standard  
The  Passive  House  Institute  U.S.  (2013a),  describes  the  Passive  House  Standard  as   "a  performance-based  and  verifiable  building  energy  metric  that  has  been   established  based  on  global  carbon  reduction  needed  to  avert  the  climate  crisis  as   well  as  future  costs  of  fossil  fuels  (peak  oil)  and  therefore  the  economic  feasibility  to   society"  (p.  18).  In  addition  to  energy  reductions,  the  Standard  includes  a  set  of   comfort  and  indoor  air  quality  criteria.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  five  main  design   principles  are  followed:  (i)  provide  a  continuous  thermal  envelope  that  avoids   thermal  bridging;  (ii)  ensure  envelope  air  tightness  to  significantly  reduce   ventilation  energy  requirements;  (iii)  use  climate  appropriate  vapour  control  layers   in  addition  to  a  continuous  air  barrier  to  avoid  the  potential  for  interstitial  moisture   accumulation  and  related  durability  issues;  (iv)  select  high-performance  insulated   glazing  units  (IGUs)  that  are  appropriate  to  the  climate;  and  (v)  use  climate  specific   continuous  mechanical  ventilation  with  energy  recovery  to  deliver  a  continuous   supply  of  fresh  air  to  building  occupants  (PHIUS,  2013a).     One  of  the  underlying  assumptions  behind  the  Passive  House  Standard  is  that   by  reducing  the  space-conditioning  load  to  a  level  that  can  be  delivered  through  the   fresh  air  ventilation  system,  the  need  for  a  separate  expensive  central  heating   system  is  eliminated.  Ideally,  savings  from  excluding  a  central  heating  system  offset   the  cost  of  upgrading  insulation  to  sufficiently  reduce  the  heating  demand  (Passive   House  Institute,  2012).  However,  according  to  Wright,  Klingenberg,  and  Pettit   (2014)  and  Abendroth  (2014),  this  does  not  hold  true  for  the  cold  continental   climates  of  North  America  due  to  the  presence  of  significantly  higher  peak  heating   loads  compared  to  Central  Europe.  Although  the  intent  of  the  Passive  House   Standard  is  to  have  heat  supplied  via  the  ventilation  system,  it  does  not  preclude   other  methods  of  heat  delivery  nor  does  it  specify  a  heating  system  type  (PHIUS,   2013a;  Cotterell  &  Dadeby,  2012).

The  Standard  is  comprised  of  multiple  criteria,  including  envelope  air   tightness,  primary  energy  demand  (PED),  thermal  and  acoustic  performance,  and   space  conditioning  energy  consumption,  which  are  summarized  in  Table  2-1.     Energy  performance  criteria  of  the  Passive  House  Standard  are  evaluated  in  relation   to  the  building  treated  floor  area  (TFA),  which  is  calculated  using  a  formula  based   on  the  German  Floor  Area  Ordinance  (Feist,  2007).

   Indoor  air  quality  and  thermal  requirements  of  the  Passive  House  Standard   are  defined  by  ISO  7730  (2005)  and  state  that  the  wintertime  indoor  air   temperature  must  remain  at  or  above  20  Â°C  and  the  surface  temperature  of  external   walls  and  glazing  must  not  be  lower  than  17  Â°C  when  outdoor  temperature  is  -10  Â°C   to  maintain  occupant  comfort  by  preventing  convection  induced  drafts  at  these   locations  (Cotterell  &  Dadeby,  2012).  Fresh  air  ventilation  rates  supplied  to  the   building  are  defined  by  the  German  DIN  1946  health  standard,  which  requires  a   minimum  of  1  m3/(m2-hr)  or  30  m3/hr  per  person  (BRE,  2009).  The  Passive  House   Standard  peak-heating  load  (PHL)  of  10  W/m2  is  derived  from  the  aforementioned   health  and  comfort  standards  (Ibid.)   As  an  alternative  compliance  criterion  to  meeting  10  W/m2  PHL,  the   standard  is  considered  to  be  met  if  the  annual  heating  demand  (AHD)  is  less  than  or   equal  to 15  kWh/m2yr.  Additionally,  the  annual  cooling  demand  (ACD)  limit  of    15  kWh/m2yr  results  from  the  ability  of  the  required  cooling  to  be  supplied   through  the  ventilation  system,  with  the  cooling  coil  maintaining  an  average   temperature  above  0  Â°C.  No  specific  requirement  was  developed  for  latent  cooling,   since  it  is  not  easily  controllable  through  envelope  design  decisions  (Schnieders  et   al.,  2011).  An  additional  requirement  of  the  Passive  House  Standard  is  to  minimize   thermal  bridging  at  all  junctions  of  the  building  envelope.  All  material  junctions  and   envelope  transitions  above  the  linear  thermal  bridge  criteria  of     0.01  W/mK   must  be  accounted  for  (Cotterell  &  Dadeby,  2012).       

2.2 Recent  Literature  on  Passive  House  Life  Cycle  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  
Research  assessing  the  life  cycle  impacts  of  buildings  constructed  to  the   Passive  House  Standard  has  primarily  been  conducted  for  buildings  located  in   Northern  and  Central  European  countries.  Most  literature  reviewed  used  case  study   comparisons  of  life  cycle  primary  energy  or  carbon  impacts  for  various  building   types  and  different  climates,  leading  researchers  to  often  arrive  at  contradicting  

   4  

conclusions  about  the  life  cycle  performance  of  Passive  House  and  low-energy   buildings.   Gustavsson  and  Joelsson  (2010)  conducted  an  analysis  of  life  cycle  primary   energy  use  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions  for  construction  and  operation  phases  of   residential  buildings  in  Sweden.  They  compared  conventional  and  low-energy   residential  buildings  as  well  as  different  heating  and  domestic  hot  water  systems   including  electric  resistance,  ground  source  heat  pump  and  district  heating.     Gustavsson  and  Joelsson  (2010)  confirm  that  as  the  thermal  envelope  of  a  building   is  improved  to  increase  operational  energy  efficiency,  more  materials  are  required,   thus  increasing  the  impact  of  embodied  energy  on  total  life  cycle  energy   consumption.  Electric  resistance  heating  was  found  to  have  the  highest  carbon   emissions,  followed  by  ground  source  heat  pump,  which  had  significantly  less   carbon  emissions  and  finally  district  heat,  which  had  slightly  lower  carbon   emissions  (Gustavsson  &  Joelsson,  2010).  The  results  also  indicated  that  whole   building  embodied  energy  contributes  45%  of  the  total  life  cycle  energy  of  the   conventional  buildings  assessed,  rising  to  60%  for  low-energy  buildings  (Ibid.).     Research  by  DahlstrÃ¸m,  SÃ¸rnes,  Tveit  Eriksen,  and  Hertwich  (2012)   compared  the  life  cycle  environmental  burden  of  wood-framed,  single-family   residential  buildings  built  to  the  2010  Norwegian  Building  Code  and  the  Norwegian   Passive  House  Standard.  The  authors  investigated  four  heating  and  hot  water   combinations,  including:  electric  resistance,  a  combination  of  electric  resistance   (60%)  and  wood  (40%),  vacuum  solar  hot  water  augmented  with  electric   resistance,  and,  a  combination  of  an  air-to-water  heat  pump  (75%)  supplemented   by  electric  resistance  (25%).  Results  indicated  that  heating  with  vacuum  solar  hot   water  and  electric  resistance  produces  the  least  life  cycle  CO2  equivalent  emissions   for  the  passive  house  envelope,  followed  closely  by  the  air-to-water  heat  pump   supplemented  with  electric  heat  (DahlstrÃ¸m  et  al.,  2012).  The  research  also   determined  that  a  Passive  House  envelope  combined  with  an  air-to-water  heat   pump  has  life  cycle  energy  savings  of  close  to  40%  and  greenhouse  gas  emission   reductions  of  30%  over  a  code-built  house  with  a  traditional  electric  resistance   heating  system.  However,  a  house  with  a  traditional  building  envelope  and  heat      5  

pump  was  found  to  have  a  similar  life  cycle  energy  burden  as  a  Passive  House  with   electric  resistance  heating  (Ibid.).     Sartori  and  Hestnes  (2007)  conducted  a  survey  of  60  case  studies  in  nine   different  countries  from  across  the  world,  covering  conventional  and  low-energy   building  life  cycle  energy  use.  The  study  was  limited  to  looking  at  embodied  and   operational  energy  and  included  both  commercial  and  residential  buildings  (Sartori   &  Hestnes,  2007).  The  study  found  a  linear  correlation  between  operating  and  total   energy  in  all  cases  surveyed,  showing  that  operational  energy  is  the  primary  driver   of  life  cycle  energy  use  for  all  climates  and  designs.  Satori  and  Hestnes  (2007)  go  on   to  state  that  low-energy  buildings  have  a  net  benefit  on  life  cycle  energy  use  despite   having  increased  embodied  energy.  Additionally,  buildings  constructed  to  the   Passive  House  Standard  were  found  to  consume  three  times  less  energy  over  their   life  cycles  when  compared  with  conventional  buildings,  while  slightly  increasing   embodied  energy  from  1171  kWh/m2  to  1391  kWh/m2  (Ibid.).  The  study  was   limited  in  that  not  all  case  studies  assessed  indicated  whether  primary  or  end-use   energy  was  being  measured,  resulting  in  assumed  units  of  measure  for  these   instances  (Ibid.).   Research  by  Himpe  et  al.  (2013)  comparing  zero-energy  Passive  House  life   cycle  energy  use  to  a  standard  house  and  a  zero-energy  house  with  a  moderately   performing  thermal  envelope  was  conducted  for  Belgian  climates.  Results  of  the   study  indicated  that  the  range  of  life  cycle  embodied  energy  for  the  standard  and   passive  house  scenarios  were  21-41  kWh/m2-yr  and  27-45  kWh/m2Â­yr,   respectively.  However,  these  same  two  buildings  designed  for  net-zero  energy  use   both  resulted  in  life  cycle  embodied  energy  of  46  kWh/m2-yr  (Himpe  et  al.,  2013).   Additionally,  a  comparison  of  the  non-renewable  embodied  energy  of  timber  and   masonry  building  structures  was  made.  The  standard  timber  building  had  lower   embodied  energy  for  the  construction  than  the  passive  house  timber  building  but   higher  embodied  energy  for  services.  Both  standard  and  passive  house  buildings   with  masonry  structure  resulted  in  significantly  higher  embodied  energy  (Ibid.).     The  findings  also  indicated  that  the  largest  life  cycle  energy  savings  result  from   selection  of  building  materials  and  services  based  on  life  cycle  assessment  criteria.      6  

Himpe  et  al.  (2013)  state  that  the  importance  of  life  cycle  embodied  energy  and  end- of-life  energy  increases  for  low-energy-buildings  as  their  operational  energy   decreases.  Additionally,  they  conclude  that  supplying  space  heating  and  DHW  with   air  source  heat  pumps  achieves  the  lowest  embodied  and  end-of-life  energy,   followed  closely  by  air  source  heat  pumps  combined  with  solar  hot  water  and  then   by  geothermal  heat  pumps  (Ibid.).     Research  conducted  by  Feist  (1997)  focused  on  defining  the  maximum  level   of  energy  reductions  possible  for  German  buildings  implementing  passive  design   strategies  by  analyzing  life  cycle  primary  energy  consumption  of  buildings  designed   to  various  energy  performance  levels.  The  study  concluded  that  over  an  80-year   assumed  building  lifespan,  the  embodied  energy  of  passive  house  insulation  would   overtake  the  life  cycle  savings  only  beyond  a  thickness  of  1050  mm  due  to  the   increase  in  energy  used  for  manufacture  of  the  insulation  and  the  diminishing   returns  in  operating  energy  reductions.  Also,  after  approximately  230  mm  of   insulation,  there  is  a  drop  in  embodied  energy  due  to  elimination  of  a  central   heating  system  (Feist,  1997).     A  journal  article  by  Passer,  Helmuth  and  Maydl  (2012)  assessed  the  life  cycle   energy  consumption  of  5  buildings  in  Austria,  including  a  Passive  House  and  low- energy  houses.  Passer  et  al.  (2012)  state  that  life  cycle  assessments  are  important   tools  for  ensuring  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  low-energy  buildings  are  not   simply  shifted  from  the  operation  to  the  construction  stage.  The  study  results   indicated  that  the  Passive  House  had  the  lowest  life  cycle  energy  use  and  that  the   proportion  of  global  warming  potential  (GWP)  attributable  to  embodied  energy  of   materials  is  31%  (Passer  et  al.,  2012).     A  thesis  by  Bowick  (2011)  focused  on  creating  a  life  cycle  assessment   database  for  new  low-rise  residential  construction  in  Canada.  The  research  scope   was  limited  to  two-storey  detached,  semi-detached  and  row  houses,  sized  according   to  the  average  national  household  size  reported  by  Statistics  Canada  in  the  2006   census.  Results  of  research  by  Bowick  (2011)  indicated  that  climate  and  fuel  mix   have  the  greatest  influence  on  life  cycle  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  It  was  also   determined  that  for  energy  efficient  buildings,  the  proportion  of  life  cycle  GWP      7  

attributable  to  embodied  impacts  can  range  from  11  to  78%  for  detached  housing,   depending  on  location  with  the  highest  percentage  occurring  in  Montreal  and  lowest   in  Halifax  (Bowick,  2011).  Sensitivity  to  material  and  fuel  use  choice  for  detached   dwellings  was  found  to  range  from  344  to  1,373  Mg  CO2eq,  with  the  highest  and   lowest  sensitivities  occurring  in  Calgary  and  Toronto,  respectively.  Regional   electricity  grid  carbon  intensity  was  identified  as  the  primary  factor  influencing  life   cycle  GWP  sensitivity  (Ibid.).  Additionally,  it  was  determined  that  designing  a   building  for  increased  energy  efficiency  results  in  an  increase  in  embodied  energy   due  to  greater  use  of  materials  such  as  insulation.  The  decreased  operating  energy   use  increases  the  influence  that  embodied  energy  has  on  the  total  life  cycle  energy   consumption  (Ibid.).   Existing  literature  covering  life  cycle  assessment  of  buildings  constructed  to   the  Passive  House  Standard  and  other  low  energy  building  standards  has  primarily   focused  on  the  European  context.  One  of  the  common  conclusions  drawn  is  that   embodied  energy  and  by  extension  the  carbon  emissions  of  low  energy  buildings,   generally  make  up  a  significant  proportion  of  the  total  life  cycle  impact.  However,   the  majority  of  this  research  fails  to  quantify  the  proportion  of  life  cycle  emissions   attributable  to  the  increased  envelope  insulation  and  indirect  supporting   components.  Factors  identified  to  have  a  major  influence  on  life  cycle  impact   include:  climate,  energy  supply  mix  carbon  intensity,  mechanical  system  efficiency,   and  carbon  intensity  of  building  materials.  Literature  by  Sartori  and  Hestnes  (2007)   and  Passer  et  al.  (2012)  concluded  that  low  energy  and  Passive  House  buildings   have  net  life  cycle  benefits  over  conventional  construction,  while  other  research   claims  that  certain  configurations  of  envelope  and  mechanical  systems  result  in   similar  life  cycle  impacts  as  conventional  buildings  (DahlstrÃ¸m  et  al.,  2012).   Contradictory  findings  reported  in  the  literature  are  likely  due  to  the  prevalent  use   of  case  studies.  Currently,  little  research  has  been  conducted  using  modeling  to   isolate  the  influence  that  the  various  parameters  have.  This  could  yield  insight  into   the  sensitivity  of  building  life  cycle  emissions  to  the  embodied  effects  of  building   materials  and  energy  supply  mix  carbon  intensities.         8  

3 Problem  Definition  and  Research  Questions  
3.1 Objective  and  Justification  
The  problem  statement  driving  the  research  is  defined  as  follows:  The  Passive   House  Standard  offers  a  building  physics  based  method  for  achieving  large   reductions  in  building  operating  energy  consumption  and  mitigating  climate  change   by  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (PHIUS,  2013a).  The  standard  includes   specifically  defined  energy  intensity  targets  covering  annual  heating  and  cooling   demand,  peak  heating  load  and  annual  primary  energy  demand.  These  intensity   targets  are  constant  across  all  climates,  countries,  and  geographic  regions  within   countries.  Additionally,  a  single  set  of  primary  energy  and  carbon  emission  factors   are  applied  to  the  entire  North  American  continent,  irrespective  of  regional   differences  in  energy  carbon  intensity.  Therefore,  the  standard  cannot  be   considered  reliable  for  quantifying  Passive  House  life  cycle  operating  greenhouse   gas  emissions.  Finally,  the  standard  lacks  consideration  of  embodied  GWP  impacts,   thus  ignoring  a  potentially  significant  portion  of  the  total  life  cycle  climate  impact  of   passive  buildings.  Therefore  a  need  exists  for  a  method  to  assist  designers  in   selecting  a  balanced  combination  of  insulation  and  mechanical  system  fuel  source  to   minimize  the  GWP  impact  of  buildings.       

3.2 Research  Questions  
The  research  addresses  the  following  questions  arising  from  the  problem  statement:     1. How  do  insulation  thickness  and  material  choice  influence  envelope   GWP?     2. What  are  the  relationships  between  location,  mechanical  system  fuel   type  and  life  cycle  GWP?   3. How  does  the  Passive  House  Standard  method  of  predicting  GWP   compare  to  a  method  taking  into  account  region  specific  electricity   carbon  intensity?  

   9  

  

3.3 Scope  and  Limitations  
The  proposed  research  scope  was  limited  to  investigating  the  impact  of  the   following  variables  on  the  life  cycle  GWP  of  a  building  designed  to  the  Passive  House   Standard:  (i)  changing  location,  (ii)  building  envelope  insulation  thickness  and   material  type,  and  (iii)  mechanical  system  fuel  type.  Building  envelope  thickness  and   space  conditioning  systems  were  sized  to  meet  the  building  energy  performance   criteria  of  the  Passive  House  Standard  shown  in  Table  2-1.  It  was  assumed  that  the   remaining  components  of  the  standard  under  the  "elemental  performance   requirements",  "services  performance"  and  "acoustic  performance"  criteria   headings  were  met.  Investigation  of  the  impact  that  variations  in  occupant   behaviour  have  on  building  energy  use  was  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study.     This  study  did  not  examine  all  of  the  aspects  of  life  cycle  GWP,  but  rather   focused  on  a  comparative  assessment  of  the  impact  that  envelope  choices  have  on   both  embodied  and  operating  GWP.  The  primary  reason  for  this  focus  stems  from   the  lack  of  literature  evaluating  the  net  life  cycle  carbon  impacts  of  Passive  House   building  envelopes.  Elements  highlighted  in  blue  in  Figure  3-1,  were  included  in  this   study.  Variables  assessed  in  this  study  are  also  indicated  on  the  Figure,  which   included  space  conditioning  and  opaque  envelope  elements.  Grey-shaded  elements,   all  of  which  fall  under  embodied  impacts,  represent  variables  excluded  due  to   limitations  of  the  chosen  life  cycle  modeling  tool.  Embodied  GWP  impacts  not   evaluated  include:  mechanical  systems,  appliances,  internal  structure,  and  interior   finishes.  Additionally,  transparent  envelope  elements  were  excluded  from  the   embodied  GWP  assessment  due  to  a  lack  of  data  specific  to  insulated  glazing   products  suitable  for  use  in  passive  buildings.  Whole-building  energy  performance   modeling  was  conducted  for  each  case  to  generate  annual  energy  consumption  data   for  input  into  the  life  cycle  assessment  software.  The  life  cycle  assessment   component  of  the  research  was  limited  to  quantification  of  GWP  in  terms  of  carbon   equivalent  emissions  (CO2  eq),  since  climate  change  mitigation  is  the  stated   objective  of  the  Passive  House  Standard.

This  study  was  limited  to  investigation  of  a  single-family  detached  reference   building,  since  the  Passive  House  Standard  is  most  difficult  to  achieve  with  this   building  typology  (Cotterell  &  Dadeby,  2012).  Although  the  level  of  insulation   attainable  would  also  be  dependent  on  financial  factors,  the  research  did  not   address  economic  considerations.  Rather,  the  study  focused  on  technological   feasibility  with  the  intent  that  the  findings  could  provide  a  basis  for  future  research   to  address  economic  concerns.  Finally,  the  study  did  not  address  the  life  cycle   impact  of  deploying  onsite  renewable  electricity  generation,  since  the  Passive  House   Standard  does  not  currently  allow  the  use  of  onsite  generated  electricity  to  meet  the   annual  primary  energy  demand  criteria.  However,  both  the  German  based  Passive   House  Institute  and  the  Passive  House  Institute  U.S.  are  currently  developing   changes  to  their  standards  to  recognize  the  importance  of  onsite  renewable   electricity  generation  in  reducing  GWP  (Wright,  Klingenberg,  &  Pettit,  2014;   WÃ¼nsch,  2014).  Therefore,  this  may  well  become  a  topic  of  further  research  in  the   future.

   A  reference  building  was  designed  according  to  passive  house  principles  to   test  the  impact  of  changing  various  envelope  and  mechanical  system  parameters  on   embodied  and  operating  life  cycle  carbon  emissions.  A  complete  description  of  the   process  used  to  develop  the  reference  building  is  covered  in  Section  4.2  (p.  15),   including  the  rationale  behind  selecting  two  mechanical  system  cases  for  analysis.  A   whole  building  energy  model  of  the  reference  building  was  created  using  WUFI   Passive,  a  software  program  capable  of  determining  the  operating  energy   consumption  in  accordance  with  the  Passive  House  Standard.  An  overview  of  the  

  13  

whole  building  energy  model  is  provided  in  Section  4.3  (p.  30),  while  Appendix  A   covers  the  detailed  inputs  and  assumptions  used  to  construct  the  reference  building   model.     A  life  cycle  carbon  impact  model  of  the  reference  building  was  created  using   Athena  Impact  Estimator  software  to  both  evaluate  envelope  embodied  GWP  and   assess  operating  GWP  based  on  energy  consumption  data  obtained  from  the  whole   building  energy  model.  The  methods  used  and  assumptions  made  are  presented  in   Section  4.4  (p.  32),  with  specific  inputs  and  calculations  for  material  take-offs   provided  in  Appendix  B.     Section  4.5  (p.  34)  covers  the  procedure  used  to  assess  reference  building   GWP  for  two  different  mechanical  system  cases  and  three  separate  Canadian   locations.  Methods  used  to  assess  reference  building  envelope  embodied  GWP   impacts  are  covered  in  Section  4.5.1  (p.  34),  which  includes  evaluation  of  different   envelope  materials  to  determine  a  range  of  impact.  Section  4.5.2  (p.  37)  describes  a   procedure  used  to  model  reference  building  operating  GWP  that  accounts  for   regional  variations  in  electricity  grid  carbon  intensity.  Operating  GWP  results  were   compared  for  different  locations  and  mechanical  systems  to  understand  the   relationship  between  these  parameters  and  to  later  determine  whether  the  regional   approach  for  determining  operating  GWP  is  justified.  Section  4.5.3  (p.  38)  details  the   process  used  to  evaluate  the  significance  of  envelope  embodied  GWP  in  relation  to   operating  GWP  for  each  permutation  of  location  and  mechanical  system  type.  The   method  used  to  compare  results  of  the  regional  based  operating  GWP  to  emissions   predicted  by  the  calculation  method  of  the  Passive  House  Standard  is  presented  in   Section  4.5.4  (p.  39).   Section  4.6  (p.  42)  covers  the  development  of  a  parametric  model  used  to  test   the  impact  that  varying  envelope  insulation  thickness  has  on  embodied  and   operating  carbon  emissions.  The  embodied  GWP  component  of  the  parametric   model,  described  in  Section  4.6.1  (p.  42),  covers  three  assembly  material   configurations  representing  different  insulation  and  wall  cladding  material  types.   Section  4.6.2  (p.  46)  details  the  procedure  used  to  assess  the  net  impact  of  varying  

  14  

insulation  thickness  on  life  cycle  carbon  emissions,  and  to  determine  the  influence   of  location  and  mechanical  system  selection.   Envelope  scenarios  optimized  for  life  cycle  GWP  were  generated  to  evaluate   the  relationship  between  annual  heat  demand  and  life  cycle  GWP,  as  described  in   Section  4.7  (p.  48).  Three  types  of  scenarios  were  evaluated  for  each  location  and   mechanical  system  type,  which  included:  "reasonable"  low  carbon  scenarios  that   account  for  diminishing  reductions  in  life  cycle  GWP  with  increasing  insulation;  life   cycle  GWP  optimized  envelope  scenarios  meeting  the  Passive  House  Standard   annual  heat  demand  criterion,  and  reference  building  envelope  scenarios.  The   method  used  for  selecting  "reasonable"  building  envelope  scenarios,  is  presented  in   Section  4.7.1  (p.  48),  while  the  method  used  for  selecting  Passive  House  building   envelopes  optimized  for  life  cycle  GWP  is  described  in  Section  4.7.2  (p.  49).  The   procedure  implemented  to  analyze  the  relationship  between  annual  heating   demand  and  life  cycle  GWP  in  different  climates  and  for  different  mechanical  system   types,  is  detailed  in  Section  4.7.3  (p.  52).          

4.2 Reference  Building  Design  
4.2.1 Building  Typology   A  reference  building  was  developed  to  model  the  life  cycle  performance  of  different   building  envelope  scenarios.  A  single  detached  house  was  selected  since  it   represents  the  most  difficult  typology  for  meeting  the  Passive  House  Standard.  This   is  due  the  detached  typology  having  a  larger  number  of  exposed  walls  compared  to   semi-detached  and  row  housing,  therefore  resulting  in  a  higher  rate  of  heat  loss.   Additionally,  this  typology  represents  over  half  of  the  residential  building  stock  in   terms  of  dwelling  units  and  67%  of  total  constructed  floor  area  (Natural  Resources   Canada,  2014).  To  ensure  that  the  design  was  relevant  to  the  Canadian  context,  the   reference  building  was  based  on  the  Canadian  average  household  dwelling  area  of   167  m2  (Table  4-1).  The  dwelling  area  was  calculated  based  on  data  for  all  Canadian   single  detached  homes  existing  up  to  2010.

   4.2.2 Geographic  Locations   Geographic  locations  selected  for  assessment  were  required  to  reflect  three   different  climates  and  three  different  electricity  grid  greenhouse  gas  intensities.   Additionally,  only  large  Canadian  population  centres  were  considered,  since  this   increased  the  likelihood  of  procuring  the  necessary  data  to  conduct  the  analyses.   The  three  locations  selected  were  represented  by  the  cities  of  Toronto,  Montreal,   and  Edmonton.  Climates  were  compared  based  on  the  number  of  heating  degree- days,  as  indicated  in  Table  4-2,  while  the  electricity  grid  for  each  location  was   compared  based  on  the  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  greenhouse  gas  emissions  per   kWh  of  electricity  consumed,  as  summarized  in  Table  4-3.

   4.2.3 Site  Characteristics   Site  characteristics  represent  factors  external  to  the  building  envelope,  including   climate,  lot  size,  lot  orientation  and  shading  objects  not  attached  to  the  building.   Microclimate  factors  were  not  considered  in  the  design  of  the  reference  building.  Lot   characteristics  were  assumed  to  allow  for  optimal  solar  south  orientation,  with  no   shading  from  trees  or  neighbouring  buildings  present,  representing  an  idealized   situation  for  Passive  House  design.        4.2.4 Building  Geometry  and  Orientation   The  reference  building  was  designed  to  Passive  House  specifications  while   representing  the  average  floor  area  of  Canadian  single-detached  dwellings.  This   required  several  assumptions  to  be  made  about  the  building  geometry  and  site   orientation.   A  square  footprint  and  two-storey  layout  were  selected  to  adhere  to  the   Passive  House  design  strategy  of  maintaining  a  compact  building  shape.  A  simplified   building  layout  and  geometry  maximize  the  internal  volume  to  floor  area  ratio,   thereby  reducing  heat  loss.  Trade-offs  are  often  made  between  compactness  and   increased  solar  gains  when  designing  passive  homes  for  a  specific  location,  typically   resulting  in  a  rectangular  building  shape  with  the  wider  faÃ§ade  oriented  east-west   for  maximized  southern  exposure.  However,  this  would  have  resulted  in  a   performance  bias  for  a  certain  location.  Therefore,  a  priority  was  given  to  

  17  

compactness  over  solar  gains.  The  geometry  and  layout  of  the  reference  building   was  kept  constant  across  all  three  locations.     The  reference  building  floor  area  was  calculated  from  exterior  envelope   dimensions,  as  per  accepted  standards  for  detached  dwellings  in  Ontario  (Tarion,   1990).  However,  the  Passive  House  Standard  uses  interior-based  floor  areas  to   calculate  energy  intensity  criteria  and  ventilation  system  energy  consumption.   Therefore,  to  enable  a  direct  comparison  of  building  performance  for  different   envelope  insulation  thicknesses,  all  adjustments  to  wall  assembly  dimensions  were   made  with  respect  to  the  interior  wall  surface.  Since  there  was  no  change  between   first  and  second  storey  floor  plates,  each  storey  represented  half  of  the  average   Canadian  floor  area  (i.e.  83.5  m2).      4.2.5 Building  Envelope   The  reference  house  was  developed  based  on  the  envelope  assemblies  of  the  Dublin   Passive  House,  a  certified  Passive  House  located  in  Urbana,  Illinois,  representative  of   a  cold  continental  climate.  The  Dublin  Passive  House  is  a  wood  framed  building  with   a  slab  on  grade  foundation  and  gabled  roof.  This  building  was  selected  due  to  the   availability  of  a  whole  building  energy  model  in  WUFI  Passive,  with  input   parameters  verified  by  PHIUS.      The  reference  building  envelope  was  designed  with  materials  and  assemblies   that  have  been  used  in  cold  climate  Passive  House  design  and  are  widely  available  in   the  Canadian  market.  Insulation  for  the  walls  and  roof  consist  of  blown-in  cellulose,   while  expanded  polystyrene  (EPS)  was  selected  as  insulation  for  the  slab  assembly.   The  reference  building  envelope  wall  sections  are  presented  in  Figure  4-2  and   assembly  thermal  properties  are  summarized  in  Table  4-4.

4.2.6 Reference  Building  Floor  Plans     Basic  floor  plans  were  drawn  to  provide  a  reference  for  placement  of  windows,   mechanical  system  ductwork  and  pipe  layouts.  Floor  plans  were  also  used  to   calculate  the  treated  floor  area  as  required  for  evaluation  of  building  energy   performance  against  the  Passive  House  Standard.  Test  house  floor  plans  are   provided  in  Figure  4-3  and  Figure  4-4.

4.2.7 Thermal  Bridging   It  was  assumed  that  thermal  bridging  would  be  negligible  since  the  reference   building  is  based  on  the  Dublin  Passive  House,  which  was  designed  to  minimize   thermal  bridging  (PHIUS,  2013a).  Therefore,  a  2-dimensional  thermal  bridge   analysis  was  not  conducted  for  assembly  details.      4.2.8 Glazing  size  and  orientation   Passive  House  design  principles  were  followed  when  sizing  windows  for  each   faÃ§ade.  Several  large  windows  located  on  the  south-facing  facade  were  oriented  to   offset  some  of  the  heat  demand.  Fewer  windows  on  the  west  faÃ§ade  helped  to   reduce  overheating,  while  limiting  north-facing  glazing  to  just  two  small  windows   reduced  the  overall  envelope  heat-loss.     High  performance  triple-paned  windows  are  a  requirement  when  designing  a   Passive  House  for  Canadian  climates.  PHIUS  certified  Alpen  725  series  (PHIUS,   2014b)  windows  were  selected  due  to  the  availability  of  data  for  input  into  WUFI   Passive.  These  windows  had  low  U-values  to  limit  heat  loss  and  sufficient  solar  heat   gain  coefficient  values  to  allow  solar  radiation  into  the  house.  The  insulated  glazing   unit  (IGU)  constructions  are  available  in  a  variety  of  configurations,  allowing  tuning   of  the  glazing  solar  heat  gain  coefficients  (SHGC)  based  on  window  orientation.   Windows  with  lower  SHGCs  also  tend  to  have  lower  U-values,  which  help  to  reduce   heat  loss  through  the  IGU.  A  summary  of  window  properties  specified  for  the   reference  building  is  provided  in  Table  4-5.    North,  West,  East,  and  South  elevation   drawings,  including  window  numbers  corresponding  to  those  in  Table  4-5  are   presented  in  Figure  4-5,  Figure  4-6,  Figure  4-7,  and  Figure  4-8,  respectively.

4.2.9 Doors   A  high-performance,  thermally  broken  exterior  entry  door  was  selected  in   accordance  with  Passive  House  design  principles.  Only  one  North  American   manufacturer  was  found  that  produces  doors  with  sufficient  thermal  properties  to   meet  the  Passive  House  Standard.    A  summary  of  the  manufacturer's  properties  for   the  selected  door  is  provided  in  Table  4-6.

   4.2.10 Ventilation  System   High  efficiency  ventilation  heat  recovery  is  a  requirement  for  meeting  the  Passive   House  Standard.  The  Passive  House  Standard  criterion  for  minimum  ventilation   system  efficiency  is  75%  for  units  tested  by  the  international  Passive  House   Institute  (Table  2-1).  High  efficiency  ventilation  systems  can  be  divided  into  two   categories:  heat  recovery  ventilators  (HRVs)  and  energy  (or  enthalpy)  recovery   ventilators  (ERVs).  ERVs  offer  the  added  benefit  of  recovering  a  fraction  of  the  latent   heat  from  water  vapour  in  the  air  to  increase  the  efficiency.  Although  there  are   several  manufacturers  and  products  available  on  the  Canadian  market,  the  Ultimate   Air  RecoupAerator  200  DX  ERV  was  selected.  This  was  based  on  the  unit's   popularity  for  North  American  Passive  House  applications  and  due  to  the  high   recovery  efficiency  compared  with  other  North  American  products.        4.2.11 Heating,  Cooling  and  Domestic  Hot  Water  Systems   Passive  house  heating  systems  are  not  restricted  by  heating  system  type,  but  rather   must  be  accounted  for  in  the  120  kWh/m2-year  primary  energy  demand  (PED)   intensity  criterion  set  out  by  the  Passive  House  Standard.  This  criterion  limits  the   amount  of  source  energy  that  can  be  used  to  operate  the  building,  including  energy  

  28  

used  for  space  conditioning.  This  allows  the  use  of  systems  with  different  fuel  types   having  different  carbon  intensities.  In  order  to  take  into  account  the  potential   variation  in  operating  GWP,  two  heating  systems  representing  the  two  most  popular   fuel  types  in  Canada  were  modeled.  For  2011,  the  two  most  commonly  used  heating   fuels  were  natural  gas  (50%)  and  electricity  (36%)  (Natural  Resources  Canada,   2014).  Table  4-7  provides  a  summary  of  equipment  used  for  the  two  mechanical   systems.

   Case  A  (NG):  A  Viessmann  natural  gas  fired  boiler  was  selected  for  space  heating   due  to  the  efficiency  of  the  unit  and  its  ability  to  also  supply  domestic  hot  water.  A   high  efficiency  Mitsubishi  electric  heat  pump  was  selected  to  supply  cooling.  An   electric  cooling  system  was  selected,  since  no  widely  available  product  capable  of   delivering  cooling  from  natural  gas  existed  on  the  market.        Case  B  (Electric):  A  Mitsubishi  mini-split  electric  air-to-air  heat  pump  system  was   selected  because  of  the  high  efficiency  of  the  unit  and  the  popularity  of  these   systems  for  North  American  Passive  Houses.  The  heat  pump  was  also  capable  of   supplying  space  cooling.    A  GE  electric  air-to-water  heat  pump  was  selected  to   provide  domestic  hot  water,  due  to  its  high  efficiency  relative  to  standard  electric   water  heaters.

4.3 Whole  Building  Energy  Model  
Whole  building  energy  modeling  was  used  to  evaluate  annual  operating  energy   consumption  of  the  reference  building  for  each  permutation  of  location  and   mechanical  system  case.  A  total  of  6  models  were  created.  Energy  consumption  data   was  then  used  to  provide  input  values  to  conduct  further  analyses,  as  described  in   Section  4.4.  This  section  discusses  the  software  used,  along  with  the  assumptions   made  and  parameters  input  into  the  software  to  set  up  the  whole  building  energy   models.        4.3.1 Whole  Building  Energy  Modeling  Software   Whole  building  energy  modeling  was  conducted  using  the  software  WUFI  Passive   (Fraunhofer  Institute  for  Building  Physics,  2012).  This  software  was  developed  as  a   result  of  collaboration  between  PHIUS,  the  Fraunhofer  Institute  for  Building  Physics   and  Owens  Corning  (PHIUS,  2013b).  WUFI  Passive  was  selected  because  it  is  the   first  building  energy  performance  simulation  software  accepted  for  Passive  House   design  certification  specifically  developed  for  use  in  North  American  climates.  The   software  allows  for  buildings  to  be  easily  modeled  and  modified  using  a  third  party   CAD  program  Â­  Trimble  Sketchup.        4.3.2 Weather  Data   WUFI  Passive  accepts  climate  data  that  is  either  manually  entered  or  loaded  into  the   software  from  a  pre-formatted  file.  Climate  data  for  the  select  cities  was  acquired   from  PHIUS  in  both  .XLS  and  .WAC  file  formats  suitable  for  simulation  in  WUFI   Passive.  PHIUS  processes  global  climate  data  from  METEONORM  into  a  format  that   is  useable  with  WUFI  Passive  (PHIUS,  2013b).  METEONORM  is  a  software  program   from  METEOTEST  that  uses  spatial  interpolation  to  provide  climate  data  for  any   location  in  the  world  (METEOTEST,  2014).

4.3.3 Metrics  for  Assessment   HVAC  energy  intensity  is  obtained  from  the  WUFI  Passive  model  and  is  used  to   determine  annual  site  electricity  (kWh/year)  and  gas  demand  (m3/year)  for  input   into  the  Athena  IE  life  cycle  model.  Annual  heating  demand  intensity  (kWh/m2-yr)  is   used  to  compare  the  performance  of  three  envelope  scenarios  with  respect  to  the   Passive  House  Standard  criteria  for  annual  heating  demand  intensity  of  15  kWh/m2- yr.      4.3.4 WUFI  Passive  Modeling  Procedure  &  Assumptions     A  full  description  of  WUFI  Passive  modeling  procedure,  including  input  parameters,   assumptions  and  their  justification  is  provided  in  Appendix  A.  The  following  list   provides  a  summary  of  the  procedure  used  to  set  up  the  whole  building  energy   model.   An  exterior  shell  model  of  the  reference  building  was  created  using  Trimble   Sketchup  8  and  imported  into  WUFI  Passive.  Window  and  door  openings  were  then   drawn  and  defined  in  WUFI  Passive.  Full  assembly  sections  for  each  assembly  case   were  created  in  WUFI  Passive,  including  insulation  and  structural  materials  such  as   studs  and  I-joist  components,  as  described  in  Section  4.2.5  (p.  18).  Assembly   materials  were  defined  from  the  WUFI  Passive  North  America  database.  For   materials  not  found  in  this  database,  the  general  materials  database  was  used.  Due   to  the  use  of  a  vented  rain  screen  for  the  wall  assembly,  the  exterior  cladding  layer   was  excluded  from  thermal  modeling.      4.3.5 Verification  of  WUFI  Passive  Model  Parameters   Input  parameters  used  to  model  the  reference  building  were  compared  with   parameters  of  the  Dublin  Passive  House  WUFI  Passive  model  (PHIUS,  2013a).  The   Passive  House  Institute  U.S  verified  input  parameters  of  the  Dublin  Passive  House   model  during  the  certification  process.  Additionally,  PHIUS  technical  bulletins  and   pre-certification  documents  were  followed  during  development  of  the  reference   building  model  (PHIUS,  2013c;  PHIUS,  2014c).  These  documents  describe  the   methods  for  calculating  mechanical  system  and  appliance  parameters  for  use  with     31  

WUFI  Passive.  The  documents  also  list  acceptable  parameter  ranges  and  default   values  to  be  used  where  no  product  data  is  available  (PHIUS,  2014c).       

4.4 Building  Envelope  Greenhouse  Gas  Model  
The  reference  building  was  modeled  to  determine  envelope  embodied  global   warming  potential  for  each  location  and  for  three  different  assembly  configurations.   This  Section  describes  the  software,  assumptions  and  system  boundaries  used  in  the   analysis.        4.4.1 Life  Cycle  Assessment  Software   Athena  Impact  Estimator  (Athena  IE)  is  a  whole  building,  cradle-to-grave,  life  cycle   assessment  tool  used  for  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impact  of  various  design   decisions  (Athena,  2014a).  The  tool  is  suitable  for  modeling  the  life  cycle  impact  of   building  shell  materials  and  assemblies  for  all  North  American  building  types  and   allows  for  distinction  of  regional  impacts,  including  aspects  such  as  regional   electricity  grid  and  product  manufacturing  impacts,  among  others  (Ibid.).   Additionally,  Athena  (2014a)  states  that  its  software  can  be  used  to  analyze  the   relative  impact  of  trade-offs  between  life  cycle  operating  and  embodied  greenhouse   gas  emissions  for  a  range  of  design  choices.      4.4.2 Software  Version  and  Data  Sources   Athena  Impact  Estimator  version  4.5.0102,  released  in  November  2013  and  revised   in  January  2014,  was  used  for  this  work.  The  Athena  IE  software  uses  a  life  cycle   inventory  (LCI)  database  developed  by  the  Athena  Institute  that  covers  a  wide  array   of  building  materials  and  products.  The  database  also  accounts  for  regional   differences  in  environmental  impact  of  the  materials.  The  data  is  obtained  from   actual  manufacturing  facilities  or  engineered  process  models  (Athena,  2014b).

4.4.3 Metrics  for  Assessment   The  metrics  used  to  assess  the  performance  of  various  envelope  assemblies   included  life  cycle  embodied  carbon  equivalent  emissions  and  life  cycle  operating   carbon  equivalent  emissions.  Athena  IE  outputs  data  for  both  embodied  GWP  and   operating  GWP  in  units  of  kg  CO2  eq,  which  were  subsequently  converted  to  Mg  CO2   eq.      4.4.4 General  Model  Assumptions   Assessment  of  embodied  GWP  was  limited  to  envelope  materials.  Athena  IE  is   currently  not  capable  of  assessing  the  embodied  impacts  of  certain  building   elements  such  as  building  services,  appliances,  cabinetry  and  fixtures.  However,  it   does  allow  for  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  changing  insulation  levels  or   selecting  various  envelope  materials,  including  cladding  and  interior  surface   finishes.  A  comparative  assessment  was  deemed  sufficient  for  the  purposes  of  this   research,  since  the  reason  for  including  embodied  emissions  was  to  investigate  the   interaction  between  envelope  insulation  levels  and  operating  GWP.  Non-envelope   materials  such  as  furnishings,  appliances,  and  fixtures  were  therefore  excluded  from   the  assessment,  since  they  do  not  have  a  direct  impact  on  operating  GWP  and  are   not  specific  to  the  requirements  of  the  Passive  House  Standard.  Although  the   mechanical  systems  assessed  in  this  study  differ  from  systems  used  in  standard   construction  and  differences  in  embodied  impact  between  mechanical  system  cases   are  likely,  building  services  were  not  assessed  because  Athena  currently  lacks  these   capabilities.  This  was  deemed  acceptable,  since  research  by  Passer  et  al.  (2012)   indicates  that  building  services  only  make  up  a  small  proportion  of  total  embodied   energy  in  Passive  Houses.  Finally,  an  assembly  service  life  of  60-years  was  assumed,   which  is  consistent  with  component  service  lives  assumed  in  life  cycle  assessment   research  by  Himpe  et  al.  (2013)  and  Bowick  (2011).

4.4.5 System  Boundaries   In  order  to  perform  life  cycle  analysis,  a  system  boundary  must  be  delineated.  The   system  boundary  for  evaluation  of  embodied  GWP  was  determined  by  the   capabilities  of  the  software.  Athena  IE  is  able  to  account  for  the  impacts  of  material   manufacture,  resource  extraction  and  recycled  content,  associated  transport,  on-site   building  construction,  maintenance  and  replacement  of  materials,  along  with   demolition  and  disposal  (Athena,  2014a).     

4.5 Reference  Building  Model  
Reference  building  assemblies  were  modeled  for  each  location  using  Athena  IE  to   determine  the  impact  of  each  assembly  on  embodied  GWP.  Athena  IE  was  also  used   to  model  operating  GWP  for  each  combination  of  location  and  mechanical  system   case.  Evaluation  of  embodied  GWP  was  conducted  to  determine  the  impact  of   envelope  material  choice  and  geographic  location.  Results  of  the  envelope  embodied   GWP  assessment  were  compared  to  operating  GWP  to  identify  the  significance  of   envelope  embodied  GWP.  A  complete  description  of  the  Athena  IE  reference   building  modeling  procedure,  including  input  parameters  is  provided  in  Appendix  B,   while  the  following  sections  summarize  the  individual  methods  used  to  assess   embodied  GWP,  operating  GWP  and  envelope  life  cycle  GWP.        4.5.1 Impact  of  Assembly  Material  Choice  on  Embodied  GWP   When  attempting  to  design  building  envelopes  with  low  embodied  GWP,  it  is   important  to  understand  the  influence  that  material  choices  can  have  on  the   outcome.  An  assessment  of  individual  life  cycle  processes  was  conducted  to   determine  the  dominant  contributor  to  assembly  embodied  GWP  and  to  identify  the   underlying  reasons  for  any  geographic  variations.  Additionally,  three  different   envelope  material  configurations  were  modeled  using  Athena  IE  to  determine  the   range  of  impact  that  material  choice  can  have  on  embodied  GWP  for  each  of  the   three  previously  defined  locations.  Configurations  1  and  2  were  created  to  represent   insulation  materials  with  low  and  high-embodied  GWP,  respectively.  A  third   configuration  was  created  to  represent  wall  cladding  material  with  high-embodied     34  

GWP  for  comparison  against  Configurations  1  and  2  (Table  4-8).  Results  are   reported  in  Section  5.1.1  (p.  54).

For  Configuration  1,  blown-in  cellulose  insulation  was  specified  as  the  low   embodied  GWP  material  used  in  the  walls  and  roof  assemblies.  EPS  was  the  lowest   embodied  GWP  material  available  which  was  suitable  for  installation  underneath   the  floor  slab.     For  Configuration  2,  blown-in  fiberglass  insulation  was  selected  for  wall  and   roof  assemblies  to  represent  the  high-embodied  GWP  insulation  case.    An  analysis   by  Harvey  (2007)  indicated  that  fiberglass  and  mineral  wool  insulation  have  a   similar  range  of  embodied  energy,  which  is  directly  correlated  with  embodied  GWP.   However,  a  comparison  of  embodied  GWP  for  these  insulation  materials  using   Athena  IE,  indicated  that  fiberglass  insulation  would  result  in  a  20%  higher   embodied  GWP  than  mineral  wool  per  m3.  Extruded  polystyrene  (XPS)  insulation   was  selected  to  represent  the  high-embodied  GWP  scenario  for  the  slab  assembly   had  a  48%  higher  embodied  GWP  than  EPS  per  m3.  Polyurethane  and   polyisocyanurate  foam  insulation  materials  were  identified  as  having  high   embodied  GWP  but  were  ultimately  not  considered  suitable  due  to  the  stance  taken   by  PHIUS  that  the  high  embodied  GWP  of  this  type  of  insulation  and  the  quantities   required  to  meet  the  Standard  render  this  material  unfavourable  (PHIUS,  2012).      Different  envelope  insulation  configurations  were  modeled  in  Athena  IE  by   directly  substituting  the  different  materials  into  the  respective  assemblies.  For  wall   and  roof  insulation  materials,  the  range  of  thermal  conductivity  values  for  blown-in   fiberglass  (0.038  to  0.039  W/m-K)  is  somewhat  lower  than  that  of  blown-in     35  

cellulose  (0.042  to  0.049  W/m-K)  (ASHRAE,  2009).    The  low  end  of  cellulose   conductivity  range  was  assumed  for  cellulose  insulation,  representing  a  well- executed  dense-packed  installation.  This  allowed  for  direct  substitution  and   comparison  of  wall  and  roof  insulation  types  without  the  need  for  re-sizing   insulation  cavities.  A  similar  situation  occurs  with  slab  assembly  insulation  types,   where  XPS  (0.22  to  0.30  W/m-K)  has  a  lower  range  of  thermal  conductivity  than  EPS   (0.32  to  0.39  W/m-K)(Ibid.).  High  density  EPS  suitable  for  insulating  slab  assemblies   has  a  thermal  conductivity  in  the  lower  end  of  this  range.  Additionally,  Harvey   (2007)  identified  that  off  gassing  of  blowing  agents  in  XPS  increases  the  thermal   conductivity  of  the  insulation  over  the  service  life  of  the  building.  Therefore,  EPS   and  XPS  were  assumed  to  have  equivalent  thermal  resistances,  allowing  for  the   same  insulation  thicknesses  to  be  compared  in  the  analysis.     Configuration  2  was  selected  to  represent  the  low  embodied  GWP  cladding   case,  while  Configuration  3  was  created  for  the  high-embodied  GWP  cladding  case.   Insulation  material  type  was  held  constant  between  Configurations  2  and  3  to   isolate  the  impact  of  changing  the  wall  cladding  material.  Cladding  options  were   selected  by  substituting  various  materials  suitable  for  residential  construction  from   the  Athena  IE  database  into  the  reference  building  wall  assembly.  Using  this   material  substitution  method,  pine  ship-lapped  and  residential  grade  30-gauge   metal  siding  were  found  to  have  the  lowest  and  highest  embodied  GWP,  respectively        Locations  were  specified  in  Athena  IE  to  determine  regional  impacts   resulting  from  life  cycle  stages  such  as  transportation  and  product  manufacturing.   Edmonton  was  the  only  location  of  the  three  not  listed  in  the  Athena  IE  database.   Therefore,  Calgary,  the  next  closest  city  in  the  province  was  selected  as  the  proxy   location  as  per  the  method  outlined  in  the  Athena  IE  user  guide  (Athena,  2014a).   Since  Athena  IE  uses  aggregated  regional  data  for  energy  supply  carbon  intensity   and  material  flows,  the  impact  of  choosing  a  proxy  location  that  was  so  close  to  the   study  location  was  deemed  to  yield  negligible  impacts  on  the  results.

4.5.2 Analysis  of  Reference  Building  Operating  Energy  Consumption  and  Operating   GWP     Reference  building  operating  energy  consumption  was  assessed  to  determine  the   impact  of  climate  on  energy  consumption,  while  operating  GWP  was  analyzed  to   determine  the  impact  of  mechanical  system  selection.  Results  are  presented  and   discussed  in  Section  5.1.2  (p.  62).     Operating  energy  consumption  data  for  each  reference  building  location  and   mechanical  system  case  was  obtained  directly  from  the  reported  values  in  WUFI   Passive  and  are  representative  of  energy  consumed  on-site.  A  decision  was  made  to   evaluate  site  energy  demand,  rather  than  the  primary  energy  demand  results   reported  by  WUFI  Passive,  since  a  single  primary  energy  factor  for  electricity  is   applied  to  all  locations  across  North  America,  which  is  not  representative  of  actual   regional  differences  in  losses  associated  with  generation  and  distribution.  Since  all   factors  other  than  location  were  kept  the  same,  results  are  indicative  of  the  impact   that  the  local  climate  has  on  energy  consumption.     Annual  site  energy  consumption  data  was  generated  for  each  reference   building  location  and  mechanical  system  case  using  WUFI  Passive.  This  data  was   subsequently  used  as  input  parameters  for  Athena  IE  to  determine  operating  GWP.   For  Case  A  (NG),  natural  gas  was  used  to  supply  heating  and  domestic  hot  water,   while  electricity  was  used  to  provide  cooling  and  to  power  auxiliary  equipment  such   as  ventilation,  lighting  and  appliances.  Athena  IE  accepts  annual  electricity   consumption  data  in  units  of  kWh,  while  natural  gas  consumption  can  be  input  as   either  kWh  or  m3.  WUFI  Passive  annual  energy  consumption  results  are  broken  out   into  separate  values  for  space  heating,  domestic  hot  water,  and  auxiliary  equipment.   Results  for  auxiliary  equipment  energy  consumption  are  reported  in  terms  of   annual  site  electricity  consumption  (kWh/yr),  which  can  be  directly  input  into   Athena  IE.  However,  heating  and  domestic  hot  water  consumption  results  are   reported  in  units  of  annual  primary  energy  consumption  (kWh/yr),  requiring  the   results  to  be  divided  by  the  primary  energy  factor  for  natural  gas  (PEFNG  =  1.1)  to   obtain  annual  site  energy  consumption  values  (PHIUS  2014c).  

  37  

For  Case  B  (Electric),  all  of  the  building  energy  requirements  are  met  by   electricity.  Therefore,  total  primary  energy  demand  results  were  used  to  back- calculate  the  site  electricity  consumption  values  for  input  into  Athena  IE.  WUFI   Passive  reports  primary  energy  demand  in  terms  of  a  treated  floor  area  (TFA)   intensity  value  (kWh/m2-yr),  which  must  be  converted  to  a  non-intensity  based  site   electricity  consumption  value  (kWh/yr).  This  was  accomplished  by  multiplying  the   primary  energy  demand  intensity  value  by  the  reference  building  treated  floor  area   (TFA  =  119  m2)  and  dividing  the  result  by  the  Passive  House  primary  energy  factor   for  electricity,  PEFELEC  =  2.7  (PHIUS,  2014c).     Life  cycle  operating  GWP  determined  for  each  location  and  mechanical   system  case  represent  the  combined  impact  of  energy  consumed  by  space   conditioning  and  auxiliary  equipment  over  a  60-year  building  life  span.  Results  were   then  compared  to  determine  which  mechanical  system  offered  the  best  operating   GWP  performance  in  each  location.        4.5.3 Comparison  of  Envelope  Embodied  GWP  and  Operating  GWP   A  comparison  of  reference  building  envelope  embodied  GWP  and  operating  GWP   was  made  in  order  to  understand  the  significance  of  envelope  embodied  GWP  in   each  location.  Results  of  the  investigation  are  discussed  in  Section  5.1.2  (p.  62).   Each  of  the  three  previously  defined  envelope  assembly  configurations  were   assessed  to  define  the  range  of  impact  that  the  tested  building  envelopes  have   relative  to  operating  GWP  for  each  permutation  of  location  and  mechanical  system.   The  impact  that  envelope  embodied  GWP  has  on  life  cycle  GWP  was  determined  by   calculating  the  percent  change  in  emissions  with  respect  to  operating  emissions   (Equation  4-1).

Total  Emb  GWP  =  sum  of  embodied  global  warming  potentials  of  the  roof,  wall,  and   slab  assemblies  (Mg  CO2eq)   Op  GWP  =  60-year  operating  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (Mg  CO2eq)        Values  representing  the  total  embodied  GWP  for  each  assembly  configuration  were   obtained  from  the  results  of  the  previous  investigation  described  in  Section  4.5.1  (p.   34).  Results  from  the  previous  analysis  in  Section  4.5.2  (p.  37)  were  used  as  input   values  for  operating  GWP.        4.5.4 Comparison  of  Passive  House  Standard  and  Regional  Based  Methods  for   Calculating  Operating  GWP   Currently,  the  Passive  House  Standard  calculation  method  for  determining   operating  GWP  uses  a  single  electricity  grid  carbon  emission  factor  for  all  of  North   America.  Use  of  operating  GWP  calculated  from  the  Passive  House  Standard  method   could  lead  designers  to  select  mechanical  systems  or  other  equipment  that  may   result  in  higher  operating  GWP  than  is  anticipated.  This  analysis  was  limited  to   looking  at  electricity  emission  factors  and  does  not  consider  the  implications  of   applying  continent-wide  emission  factors  for  other  energy  carriers  such  as  natural   gas.  Results  of  this  investigation  are  reported  in  Section  5.1.3  (p.  70).   Locations  assessed  for  this  study  coincide  with  each  of  Canada's  three   interconnection  regions,  with  Toronto,  Montreal  and  Edmonton  representing   Eastern,  Quebec,  and  Western  electricity  grids,  respectively  (Figure  4-9).  Canadian   provinces  primarily  trade  electricity  with  American  states  to  the  south,  as  opposed   to  neighbouring  provinces  to  the  east  and  west  (Bordeleau,  2011).  Additionally,  the   amount  of  electricity  imported  to  the  locations  analyzed  in  this  study  is  insignificant   compared  to  the  total  electricity  generated  within  the  respective  provinces,  as   indicated  in  Table  4-9.     To  understand  the  impact  that  the  Passive  House  Standard  calculation   method  can  have  on  design  decisions,  a  comparison  was  made  between  operating   GWP  results  calculated  based  on  continental  (Passive  House  method)  and  regional  

  39  

(Athena  IE  method)  carbon  intensities.    Results  were  obtained  for  the  Passive  House   Standard  method  by  modeling  reference  building  operating  GWP  for  each   combination  of  location  and  mechanical  system  using  WUFI  Passive.   Several  calculation  steps  were  required  to  determine  the  operating  GWP   from  WUFI  Passive,  since  the  reports  generated  only  indicate  results  for  mechanical   system  operating  GWP.  Therefore,  emissions  generated  by  the  building  auxiliary   equipment  had  to  be  calculated  for  each  permutation  of  location  and  mechanical   system.  WUFI  Passive  reports  include  the  annual  primary  energy  demand  of   auxiliary  equipment,  which  when  multiplied  together  with  a  carbon  emission  factor   can  be  used  to  calculate  operating  GWP.

The  electricity  grid  carbon  emission  factor  assumed  by  the  Passive  House   Standard  for  all  of  North  America  is  680  g  CO2eq/kWh  final  (Feist,  2007).  This  value   represents  the  quantity  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  GWP  per  kWh  of  energy  used   on  site.  Total  operating  emissions  were  calculated  using  the  Passive  House  method  

  41  

by  first  adding  together  ventilation  system  (Q  vent)  and  appliance  (Q  app)  electricity   demand  results  from  WUFI  Passive  to  obtain  the  auxiliary  equipment  electricity   demand  (Q  aux)  (Equation  4-2).        Q  aux  =  Q  vent  +  Q  app           Auxiliary  electricity  demand  values  were  subsequently  multiplied  by  the  electricity   carbon  emission  factor  (x  CO2)  to  obtain  the  auxiliary  equipment  annual  operating   GWP  (Op  GWP  aux)  (Equation  4-3).        Op  GWP  aux  =  Q  aux  Â·   x  CO2           Auxiliary  equipment  annual  GWP  was  then  added  to  the  mechanical  system  annual   GWP  (Op  GWP  mech)  obtained  from  WUFI  Passive.  The  resulting  values  were   multiplied  by  the  operating  life  span  of  the  building  (60  years)  to  yield  the  final   operating  GWP  (Op  GWP  final)  (Equation  4-4).        Op  GWP  final  =  Op  GWP  aux  +  Op  GWP  mech        Results  previously  obtained  from  the  method  described  in  Section  4.5.2  (p.  38)  were   used  to  represent  the  Athena  IE  calculation  method  for  comparison  with  the  Passive   House  method.  The  percent  difference  between  the  two  methods  was  calculated  to   evaluate  the  amount  of  divergence  in  the  respective  results.        (4-4)      (4-3)      (4-2)  

4.6 Envelope  Parametric  Analysis  
4.6.1 Impact  of  Insulation  Thickness  on  Envelope  Embodied  GWP   The  impact  that  insulation  thickness  has  on  assembly  embodied  GWP  was  evaluated   for  three  locations  and  three  assembly  material  configurations  representing   different  insulation  and  wall  cladding  material  types.  Results  are  presented  in   Section  5.2.1  (p.  72).  The  three  assembly  material  configurations  evaluated  were  

  42  

previously  defined  in  Section  4.5.1  (p.  34).  Each  assembly  was  evaluated  in  isolation   by  varying  the  thickness  of  insulation  using  Athena  IE.  Insulation  increments  for   each  assembly  are  defined  as  follows.     Wall  assemblies  were  modeled  with  varying  levels  of  blown  in  insulation,   defined  by  the  depth  of  the  stud  wall  or  I-joist  cavity  (Table  4-10).  The  first  two   iterations  were  conducted  for  a  140  mm  (2"x6")  structural  stud  cavity,  Iteration  0   contained  no  insulation  (air  filled  cavity)  and  Iteration  1  was  filled  with  blown  in   cellulose  insulation.  Iterations  2  and  3  consisted  of  double  stud  wall  systems,  where   an  insulation  cavity  wall  was  added  to  the  exterior  with  dimensions  of  89  mm  and   140  mm  for  Iterations  2  and  3,  respectively.  Iterations  4  through  11  comprised  a   140  mm  interior  structural  stud  cavity  and  an  exterior  insulation  cavity  framed  with   I-joists.  The  thickness  of  the  I-joist  wall  was  increased  for  each  iteration  by  moving   to  the  next  size  available  from  the  I-joist  manufacturer  to  increase  the  insulation   cavity  depth.

   The  roof  assembly  model  was  created  based  on  the  reference  building.   Depths  of  insulation  for  Iterations  0  through  2  were  adjusted  according  to  the  depth   of  the  interior  ceiling  service  cavity  (Table  4-11).  For  Iterations  0  to  1,  the  service   cavity  was  constructed  from  38  mm  x  89  mm  (2"x4")  joists  spaced  at  400  mm  (16  

  43  

inches)  on  centre.    For  Iterations  2  through  9,  the  ceiling  service  cavity  was   increased  to  140  mm  by  using  38  mm  x  140  mm  (2"x6")  joists,  400  mm  on  centre.   For  insulation  Iterations  3  through  10,  additional  insulation  was  added  on  top  of  the   ceiling  assembly  in  the  vented  attic  space  (between  the  roof  trusses)  and  increased   by  100  mm  increments  for  each  of  the  subsequent  iterations.

   The  floor  slab  assembly  consisted  of  a  200  mm  (8-inch)  concrete  floor  slab   placed  on  top  of  a  polyethylene  vapour  retarder,  with  varying  levels  of  EPS   insulation  located  underneath  these  two  layers.  EPS  insulation  depths  for  Iterations   0  through  4  were  increased  from  0  mm  to  102  mm  (level  0  to  4)  in  25.4  mm  (1  inch)   increments  (Table  4-12).  For  Iterations  5  through  10,  the  insulation  depth  was   increased  in  50.8  mm  (2  inch)  increments  to  a  maximum  of  406  mm  (16  inches).   This  was  done  in  order  to  account  for  the  effects  of  diminishing  energy  savings   when  modeling  life  cycle  GWP.  These  increments  reflect  commonly  available   thicknesses  of  EPS  insulation.

4.6.2 Relative  Impact  of  Insulation  Thickness  on  Building  Life  Cycle  GWP   The  impact  of  insulation  thickness  on  both  operating  GWP  and  embodied  GWP  were   evaluated.  Since  operating  GWP  is  partially  dependent  on  the  type  of  fuel  consumed   to  provide  space  conditioning,  two  mechanical  systems  representing  two  commonly   available  fuel  types  were  assessed.  Although  operating  GWP  at  each  location  differs   between  Case  A  (NG)  and  Case  B  (Electric)  mechanical  systems,  the  envelope   embodied  GWP  for  Cases  A  and  B  remain  identical.     In  order  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  insulation  thickness  on  assembly  life  cycle   GWP  for  each  location  and  mechanical  system,  the  magnitude  of  the  combined   reduction  in  embodied  GWP  and  operating  GWP  was  determined  for  each   incremental  increase  in  insulation  thickness.  The  impact  of  each  insulation   increment  was  evaluated  relative  to  the  reference  building  envelope,  with  results   reported  in  Section  5.2.2  (p.  81).  This  test  was  developed  to  determine  whether   further  additions  of  insulation  beyond  reference  building  levels  yield  a  net  reduction   in  life  cycle  GWP.    

  46  

WUFI  Passive  modeling  was  conducted  by  varying  the  insulation  thickness  of   one  assembly  while  holding  the  other  two  assemblies  constant  at  reference  building   insulation  levels  to  isolate  the  impact  of  the  assembly  in  question.  Assembly   insulation  thickness  was  adjusted  from  0  mm  to  a  maximum  value  for  each  type  of   assembly,  as  previously  defined  in  Section  4.6.1  (p.  42).    Operating  GWP  for  each   increment  in  assembly  insulation  thickness  was  determined  using  the  method   described  in  Section  4.5.2  (p.  37),  while  assembly  embodied  GWP  results  were   obtained  from  the  previous  analysis  described  in  Section  4.6.1  (p.  42).  These   modeling  runs  are  herein  referred  to  as  "assembly  iterations".     By  comparing  assembly  iterations  to  the  reference  building  results,  the   difference  in  magnitude  of  life  cycle  GWP  impact  between  assembly  insulation  levels   can  be  determined  and  data  trends  can  be  identified.  The  GWP  impact  of  the   assembly  relative  to  the  reference  building  was  calculated  by  determining  both  the   difference  in  operating  GWP,  (  )!   and  embodied  GWP,  (  )!    between  the  assembly  in  question  and  reference  building  using  Equations  4-5  and   4-6,  respectively.           And         Where:     (  )   =  Operating  GWP  for  assembly  iteration    (Mg  CO2eq)   (  )   =  Operating  GWP  for  reference  building  assembly  (Mg  CO2eq)   (  )   =  Embodied  GWP  for  assembly  iteration    (Mg  CO2eq)   (  )   =  Embodied  GWP  for  reference  building  assembly  (Mg  CO2eq)      Operating  and  embodied  difference  values  were  then  added  together  to   determine  the  relative  impact  that  changing  to  the  assembly  configuration  in   question  has  on  the  life  cycle  GWP  (Equation  4-7).  This  single  metric  is  referred  to   (  )! =

Assembly  iterations  with  positive  values  for  relative  LC  GWP  indicate  an  increase  in   GWP  impact  over  the  reference  building  assembly,  whereas  negative  values   represent  a  decrease.      (4-7)  

4.7 Envelope  Life  Cycle  Optimization  Model  
4.7.1 Selection  of  Envelope  Scenarios  Based  on  Life  Cycle  GWP     Whole  house  scenarios  were  modeled  for  each  climate  and  mechanical  system  case   for  later  comparison  against  respective  scenarios  meeting  the  annual  heating   demand  criteria  of  the  Passive  House  Standard.  The  dataset  of  life  cycle  GWP  for   individual  building  assemblies  was  used  to  create  several  whole  house  scenarios  for   evaluation  of  the  relationship  between  annual  heating  demand  and  life  cycle   greenhouse  gas  emissions.  These  scenarios  were  based  on  the  reference  building,   with  different  combinations  of  opaque  assemblies  including  walls,  roof  and  floor   slab.  Embodied  GWP  of  these  envelope  components,  along  with  operating  GWP  were   included  in  the  evaluation  of  envelope  life  cycle  GWP  performance.     Scenarios  were  selected  based  on  the  calculation  of  a  life  cycle  GWP   reduction  indicator.  This  indicator  was  created  to  standardize  results  of  the   individual  building  assembly  analyses  for  comparison  of  the  assemblies,  since  the   previously  modeled  assembly  iterations  had  differing  increments  in  insulation   thickness.  By  dividing  the  difference  in  assembly  life  cycle  GWP  by  the  difference  in   insulation  thickness,  the  magnitude  of  GWP  reductions  achieved  by  increasing  the   insulation  thickness  could  be  determined.    Results  are  presented  in  Section  5.3  (p.   92).     A  threshold  value  criterion  representing  a  tolerable  level  of  diminishing  GWP   reductions  with  increasing  insulation  thickness  was  estimated  based  on  the  

  48  

diminishing  return  curves  from  the  results  in  Section  5.3  (p.  92).  A  set  threshold   value  criterion  was  necessary  to  standardize  the  selection  of  assemblies  to  create   whole  building  envelope  scenarios  for  further  analysis.  The  threshold  value   criterion  used  for  scenario  selection  was:     LC  GWP  =  -50  kg  CO2eq/mm  insulation   This  value  represents  a  first  guess  at  a  "reasonable  limit",  beyond  which  the   magnitude  of  life  cycle  GWP  reductions  achieved  no  longer  justify  the  added   insulation.  Additional  scenarios  for  assembly  insulation  levels  just  above  and  below   the  indicator  target  value  were  included  to  increase  confidence  in  the  analysis  and   to  extend  the  data  set  for  later  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  annual  heating   demand  and  life  cycle  global  warming  potential.  In  the  case  where  this  threshold   value  was  not  met,  an  alternative  criterion  was  created  which  allows  for  selection  of   an  assembly  if  the  LC  GWP  result  is  the  same  for  two  consecutive  insulation   increments.  This  alternative  criterion  allows  for  a  situation  where  a  plateau   between  results  occurs.      4.7.2 Selection  of  Passive  House  Envelope  Scenarios  Optimized  for  Life  Cycle  GWP   Assemblies  were  selected  for  each  location  and  mechanical  system  configuration  to   form  whole  building  envelope  scenarios  that  meet  the  Passive  House  Standard   annual  heating  demand  criteria  of  15  kWh/m2-yr.  Wall,  roof  and  slab  assemblies   selected  for  each  scenario  represent  combinations  with  the  lowest  life  cycle  GWP   that  also  met  the  AHD  criteria.  Selection  was  accomplished  through  the  use  of  a   brute-force  optimization  method,  also  known  as  direct  search.  This  optimization   method  was  very  simple  but  was  limited  in  that  it  was  slow  and  could  only  optimize   one  variable  at  a  time  (Bolker,  2008).  Other  optimization  methods  and  programs   were  considered,  such  as  Pareto-based  optimization  using  a  multi-objective  genetic   algorithm  (Flager  et  al.,  2012)  and  COPRAS,  a  multiple  criteria  complex  proportional   assessment  method  (Lapinskiene  &  Martinaitis,  2013).  These  methods  were   ultimately  rejected  due  to  the  requirement  of  specialized  software  and  their   inherent  complexity.  Brute-force  optimization  offered  a  simple  method  without  the  

  49  

need  for  any  specialized  software  and  was  capable  of  being  used  for  selecting   envelope  assembly  configurations  that  will  meet  the  Passive  House  Standard  annual   heating  demand  criteria  with  low  life  cycle  GWP.   The  brute-force  method  was  applied  as  summarized  in  the  following  process   description  and  in  Figure  4-10,  with  numbers  in  the  Figure  correspond  to  the  listed   steps.  For  each  location  and  mechanical  system  case:   1. All  assembly  LC  GWP  results  were  arranged  into  a  single  spreadsheet  column   with  assembly  iteration  names  in  adjacent  column     2. The  difference  in  GWP  (reduction)  was  calculated  between  each  insulation   level  for  each  assembly  type  in  the  column  adjacent  to  the  results   3. All  columns  were  then  sorted  from  highest  to  lowest  reduction  value   4. A  wall,  roof,  and  slab  assembly  were  selected  from  the  top  of  list  as  the   evaluation  starting  point.  These  assemblies  were  input  into  WUFI  Passive  to   check  whether  AHD  met  the  target  value  of  15  kWh/m2-yr  (+/-  0.5  kWh/m2- yr)   5. If  the  AHD  target  value  was  not  met,  the  next  sequential  assembly  in  the   column  was  selected,  while  respecting  the  order  of  assembly  number  (e.g.  the   next  step  beyond  TO  Walls  6  was  to  change  the  roof  assembly  to  TO  Roof  6.   Despite  the  fact  that  TO  Walls  8  had  a  greater  GWP  reduction  value,  it  was   skipped  and  TO  Walls  7  was  assessed.  This  was  required  to  maintain  the   sequence  of  assembly  insulation  level  increases.   6. At  this  point,  the  Passive  House  AHD  criteria  was  met  for  this  permutation  of   location  and  mechanical  system  case

   4.7.3 Comparison  of  Envelope  Scenario  Annual  Heat  Demand  and  Life  Cycle  GWP   A  comparison  of  scenario  annual  heat  demand  and  life  cycle  GWP  was  performed  to   determine  if  a  relationship  exists  between  the  two  variables.  Additionally,  the   comparison  was  used  to  determine  whether  the  Passive  House  criteria  for  annual   heat  demand  results  in  similar  GWP  reductions  for  all  locations  evaluated.  Results   are  discussed  in  Section  5.3.2  (p.  99).   Annual  heat  demand  and  life  cycle  global  warming  potential  were  modeled  for  a   total  of  31  envelope  scenarios.  This  included  6  reference  building  scenarios  defined   in  Section  4.2.5  (p.  18),  19  envelope  scenarios  optimized  for  life  cycle  GWP,  as   defined  in  Section  4.7.1  (p.  48)  and  the  6  Passive  House  envelope  scenarios   described  in  Section  4.7.2  (p.  49).  A  summary  of  scenarios  evaluated  is  presented  in   Table  4-15.

   Annual  heat  demand  values  were  modeled  using  WUFI  Passive,  while  life  cycle   GWP  results  were  determined  using  Athena  IE,  according  to  the  method  in  Section   4.6.2  (p.  46).  Annual  heat  demand  results  were  then  graphed  against  life  cycle  GWP   for  both  mechanical  system  cases,  with  the  scenarios  organized  by  location.  The   relationship  between  AHD  and  life  cycle  GWP  was  determined  for  each  location  by   fitting  a  linear  trend  line  to  the  data  and  examining  the  slope  value  of  the  trendline   equation.  The  slope  value  allows  for  the  significance  that  changing  AHD  has  on  life   cycle  GWP  to  be  determined.

5 Results  and  Discussion  
This  Section  details  the  results  obtained  via  the  methods  described  in  Section  4  (p.   13)  and  provides  an  analysis  of  the  results  in  order  to  answer  the  research   questions  identified  in  Section  3.2  (p.  9).       

5.1 Results  of  Reference  Building  Models  
5.1.1 Impact  of  Envelope  Material  Choice  on  Embodied  GWP   A  life  cycle  analysis  of  reference  building  envelope  embodied  GWP  was  conducted  to   identify  the  process  with  the  greatest  influence  and  to  determine  the  underlying   factors  behind  geographic  variations  in  embodied  GWP  results.  Additionally,  three   envelope  assembly  configurations  were  tested  for  each  location  to  determine  the   impact  that  various  assembly  materials  had  on  embodied  GWP,  according  to  the   method  described  in  Section  4.5.1  (p.  34).        Influence  of  Life  Cycle  Stage  on  Envelope  Embodied  GWP   Results  summarized  in  Table  5-1  indicate  that  for  all  locations  assessed,  the  product   manufacturing  life  cycle  stage  contributes  the  majority  of  emitted  carbon  for  the   wall  assembly.  Manufacturing  process  related  emissions  vary  greatly  based  on   location,  with  assembly  components  manufactured  for  Edmonton  216%  greater   than  Montreal  and  188%  greater  than  Toronto.  The  end  of  life  (deconstruction  and   demolition)  stage  contributes  significantly  to  reducing  the  overall  assembly   embodied  GWP  through  sequestration  of  carbon  with  results  consistent  across  all   three  locations.  Athena  IE  does  not  include  temporary  sequestration  of  carbon   during  the  service  life  of  a  material  but  does  provide  a  credit  for  the  use  of  wood   products  harvested  from  forests  where  no  subsequent  land  use  change  occurs.  The   methodology  used  by  Athena  IE  for  carbon  sequestration  accounting  uses  a  100- year  time-frame  and  is  conducted  in  overall  accordance  with  three  international   standards,  including:  PAS  2050;  ISO/TC  14067;  and  WRI  GHG  Protocol  for  Products  

  54  

   (Athena,  2014a).  Additionally,  end-of-life  emissions  associated  with  wood  products   are  accounted  for  according  to  the  Product  Category  Rules  for  North  America   developed  by  FPInnovations.  This  includes  accounting  of  carbon  emissions  related   to  the  various  end-of-life  processes  including:  recycling;  combustion;  landfill  gas   combustion;  and  fugitive  or  non-combustion  landfill  emissions  (Ibid.).

For  the  reference  building  roof  assembly,  a  majority  of  the  impacts  are  

incurred  during  the  product  manufacturing  life  cycle  stage,  while  the  end  of  life   stage  reduces  the  overall  embodied  GWP  of  the  assembly  (Table  5-2).  The  negative   values  in  the  end  of  life  stage  are  a  result  of  the  roof  assembly  being  comprised   primarily  of  wood  products.  The  amount  of  emissions  incurred  depends  largely  on   where  the  product  was  manufactured.  Roof  assembly  materials  manufactured  in   Edmonton  incur  significantly  higher  impacts  than  Montreal  or  Toronto.  Although   the  roof  structure  and  insulation  consisted  of  wood  based  materials,  the  end  of  life   embodied  GWP  was  substantially  higher  than  that  of  the  wall  structure.  This   difference  can  be  explained  by  the  use  of  standing  seam  metal  roofing,  which  does   not  sequester  carbon  but  rather  increases  the  GWP  burden  of  the  assembly.  The   wall  assembly  yielded  a  lower  end  of  life  GWP  than  for  the  roof  assembly  since  wall   cladding  was  comprised  of  carbon  sequestering  pine  board.  It  should  be  recognized  

  55  

   that  these  results  represent  approximations,  since  Athena  IE  assumes  materials   currently  sent  for  recycling  or  landfilling  will  continue  to  follow  these  end-of-life   pathways  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  landfilled  materials  are  assigned  additional   approximated  carbon  emissions  due  to  transportation  to  and  decomposition  of  the   materials  in  the  landfill  (Ibid.).

   Analysis  of  the  reference  building  slab  assembly  indicated  that  nearly  all  of  

the  impacts  are  incurred  during  the  product  manufacturing  life  cycle  stage  (Table   5-3).  This  is  because  the  slab  assembly  is  primarily  comprised  of  concrete  and  EPS   insulation,  a  petrochemical  product.  Influence  of  location  on  the  product   manufacturing  GWP  remains,  but  it  is  less  pronounced  than  for  the  other  two   assemblies.  Unlike  the  wall  and  roof  assemblies,  there  is  no  sequestration  of  carbon   at  the  end  of  life  stage.

   The  product  manufacturing  stage  was  found  to  contribute  the  majority  of   emitted  carbon  for  wall,  roof  and  slab  assemblies.    All  assemblies  evaluated  for   Edmonton  had  the  highest  embodied  GWP,  while  assemblies  assessed  for  Montreal   yielded  the  lowest  embodied  GWP  results.  Therefore,  these  processes  can  have  a   large  impact  on  the  material  embodied  GWP  if  the  process  consumes  energy  from  a   source  with  high  carbon  intensity.  Edmonton  has  the  highest  electricity  carbon   intensity,  while  Montreal  has  the  lowest  carbon  intensity  (see  Table  4-3),  which  is   reflected  in  the  results  for  assembly  embodied  GWP.       Athena  IE  accounts  for  material  flows  for  each  region  available  in  its   database  through  product  market  share  analysis.  Therefore,  weighted  averages  of   transportation  distances  and  manufacturing  impacts  are  used  to  represent  the   average  product  impact  for  each  region  (Athena,  2014a).  Since  transportation   related  GWP  impacts  were  found  to  comprise  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  total   embodied  GWP  for  wall,  roof  and  slab  assemblies,  an  emphasis  on  sourcing   materials  manufactured  locally  may  not  always  result  GWP  reductions.     It  is  not  uncommon  for  North  American  passive  house  designers  to  specify   specialty  envelope  products  sourced  from  Europe,  including  windows,  tapes,   insulating  sheathing,  and  so  called  intelligent  vapour  retarders.  Although  this   research  did  not  consider  the  impact  of  products  sourced  from  overseas,  given  the     57  

   nature  of  these  results,  expanding  the  research  to  include  imported  products  would   help  guide  designers  in  making  the  best  material  selection.        Impact  of  Insulation  Choice  on  Embodied  GWP   Results  of  the  analysis  quantifying  the  impact  of  insulation  material  choice  on   embodied  GWP  are  summarized  in  Table  5-4.  For  Toronto,  an  increase  of  257%  in   total  envelope  embodied  GWP  was  observed  between  the  low  and  high-embodied   GWP  configurations.  Changing  wall  assembly  insulation  materials  from  cellulose  to   fiberglass  and  changing  slab  assembly  insulation  from  EPS  to  XPS  contributed  45%   and  43%  of  the  increase  in  total  embodied  GWP,  while  changing  roof  assembly   insulation  from  cellulose  to  fiberglass  contributed  only  12%.  Changing  slab   assembly  insulation  had  a  much  greater  impact  on  embodied  GWP  than  the  other   two  assemblies  when  the  comparison  is  made  in  relation  to  the  total  material   volume.

   Changing  assembly  insulation  materials  from  Configuration  1  to  2  in   Montreal  resulted  in  an  increase  in  total  envelope  embodied  GWP  of  71%.  Changing   wall  assembly  insulation  only  slightly  increased  total  embodied  GWP  (3%),  while   changing  roof  insulation  yielded  a  slight  decrease  in  embodied  GWP  (-5%).   Substituting  slab  assembly  insulation  from  EPS  to  XPS  resulted  in  an  increase  of   88%  of  the  total  embodied  GWP  of  the  reference  building.  This  is  because   manufacturing  GWP  of  fiberglass  is  tied  to  regional  electricity  grid  carbon  intensity,   while  XPS  manufacturing  GWP  is  driven  by  blowing  agent  carbon  intensity,  which  is   consistent  across  all  regions  assessed.  Slab  assembly  insulation  was  also  dominant   on  a  volumetric  basis.     Results  for  Edmonton  indicated  that  changing  assembly  insulation  materials   from  Configuration  1  to  2  (defined  on  p.  35)  significantly  increases  the  total   envelope  embodied  GWP  (288%).  Changing  wall  assembly  insulation  from  cellulose   to  fiberglass  contributed  the  majority  of  the  increase  to  total  embodied  GWP  (61%),   while  roof  and  slab  assembly  insulation  changes  made  up  less  of  the  increase  (21%   and  18%).  However,  on  a  volumetric  basis,  wall  and  slab  assembly  insulation   material  choices  have  equal  impacts  on  envelope  embodied  GWP.   The  impact  of  wall  and  roof  assembly  insulation  choice  on  embodied  GWP   varies  between  locations,  with  the  greatest  impact  occurring  in  Edmonton  and   lowest  impact  in  Montreal.    This  indicates  a  link  between  electricity  grid  carbon   intensity  and  material  embodied  GWP,  with  the  importance  of  considering   embodied  GWP  of  insulation  being  greatest  for  materials  sourced  from  regions  with   high  carbon  electricity,  such  as  Alberta.  It  also  suggests  that  sourcing  locally   manufactured  insulation  in  these  regions  could  potentially  result  in  greater   embodied  GWP  than  if  insulation  was  imported  from  a  region  with  low  carbon   electricity.  The  impact  of  insulation  material  choice  on  embodied  GWP  is  almost   negligible  in  regions  supplied  primarily  by  electricity  generated  from  renewable   sources,  such  as  Quebec  and  British  Columbia    (Statistics  Canada,  2014b;  2014d).   It  is  important  to  note  that  the  results  represent  approximations  of  the   specific  building  envelope  configurations  assessed.  Documentation  for  Athena  IE   indicates  that  comparative  assessments  conducted  for  material  substitutions  are     59  

   considered  to  produce  results  with  uncertainties  of  15%  or  less.  Additionally,   material  take-offs  were  determined  to  be  within  10%  of  actual  manual  take-off   quantities  (Athena,  2014a).  Walls  and  roof  structures  evaluated  were  primarily   comprised  of  wood,  therefore  the  overall  embodied  GWP  results  would  likely  be   significantly  higher  if  other  envelope  types  such  as  insulated  concrete  forms  or   structural  insulating  panels  were  used.     On  a  volumetric  basis,  slab  insulation  choice  had  the  largest  impact  on   embodied  GWP.  However,  very  little  variation  in  the  difference  of  slab  insulation   embodied  GWP  occurs  between  locations,  suggesting  that  the  impact  is  not   dependent  on  regional  electrical  grid  carbon  intensity.  Instead,  it  is  likely  due  to  the   use  of  high  GWP  halocarbon  blowing  agents  in  the  manufacture  of  XPS  insulation   (Harvey,  2007).         Impact  of  Wall  Cladding  Choice  on  Embodied  GWP   Configurations  2  and  3  (defined  on  p.  35)  were  compared  to  assess  the  impact  of   cladding  material  selection  on  total  envelope  embodied  GWP  for  each  location.  Only   the  wall  cladding  was  changed  between  the  two  scenarios,  with  Configuration  2   using  ship-lapped  pine  and  Configuration  3  using  residential  grade,  30  gauge  metal   siding.  Results  presented  in  Table  5-5  indicate  that  wall  cladding  material  choice  can   have  a  significant  impact  on  overall  envelope  embodied  GWP,  with  the  largest   increase  occurring  in  Montreal  (1400%)  and  the  smallest  in  Edmonton  (70%).   These  results  are  representative  of  the  different  maintenance  and  replacement   requirements  of  each  cladding  material.  This  includes  region  specific  differences  in   maintenance  frequency,  energy  use  and  on-site  waste  associated  with  maintenance   (Athena,  2014a).  However,  the  magnitude  of  impact  that  cladding  material  choice   has  on  embodied  GWP  is  similar  in  all  three  locations.  Steel  was  used  to  represent   the  metal  cladding  in  Athena  IE  (Ibid.).  Therefore,  the  lack  of  variation  between   locations  is  likely  due  to  the  use  of  coke  in  steel  manufacturing,  which  comprises  the   bulk  of  the  materials  embodied  GWP  impacts  (U.S.  Environmental  Protection   Agency,  2003).  This  suggests  that  regional  electricity  grid  carbon  intensity  is  not  the  

  60  

   primary  driver  of  metal  cladding  embodied  GWP,  although  it  could  account  for  the   small  differences  between  locations.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  other  cladding   types  not  included  in  the  analysis  could  exhibit  regional  variation  in  embodied  GWP,   especially  materials  requiring  significant  input  of  electricity  during  their   manufacture.  Although  metals  are  highly  durable  and  recyclable,  the  energy  and   thus  carbon  penalty  incurred  during  the  initial  manufacturing  and  end  of  service  life   reprocessing  is  not  recuperated.

A  comparison  of  the  results  for  reference  building  wall  assembly  insulation   and  cladding  material  choices  on  embodied  GWP  was  made  to  determine  the   assembly  layer  with  the  largest  impact.  Results  presented  in  Table  5-6  indicate  that   choice  of  wall  cladding  material  has  a  much  greater  impact  on  envelope  embodied   GWP  than  choice  of  insulation  in  Toronto  or  Montreal,  while  wall  cladding  and   insulation  material  choices  have  similar  impacts  on  reference  building  embodied   GWP  in  Edmonton.  These  results  indicate  that  wall  cladding  material  choice  should   be  carefully  considered  in  all  locations  across  Canada  when  designing  low  carbon   building  envelopes.  Additionally,  insulation  material  choice  does  not  have  a  large   impact  on  overall  envelope  embodied  GWP  in  locations  with  low  carbon  electricity   sources.

5.1.2 Operating  Energy  Consumption  and  Operating  GWP   An  analysis  of  the  impact  that  location  and  mechanical  system  fuel  selection  have  on   operating  energy  consumption  and  GWP  was  conducted  for  the  reference  building   envelope  defined  in  Table  4-4  and  mechanical  systems  described  in  Table  4-7.  The   impact  that  location  has  on  energy  consumption  was  determined  through   examination  of  the  WUFI  Passive  whole  building  energy  modeling  results.     Total  life  cycle  operating  energy  consumption  for  each  location  and  mechanical   system  combination  is  shown  in  Figure  5-1.  These  results  represent  energy   consumed  on-site  and  do  not  factor  in  losses  associated  with  energy  generation  or   distribution.  Since  all  factors  other  than  location  were  kept  the  same,  results  for   each  mechanical  system  case  are  representative  of  the  impact  that  climate  has  on   energy  consumption.

Figure  5-1  Impact  of  Location  and  Mechanical  System  Choice  on  Life  Cycle  Operating  Energy   Consumption  

Case  A  (NG)  energy  consumption  results  are  higher  than  Case  B  (Electric)  for   all  locations.  Over  the  lifetime  of  the  building,  a  Case  B  (Electric)  mechanical  system   would  consume  70.8%,  71.9%  and  74.1%  of  the  site  energy  of  Case  A  (NG)  for   Toronto,  Montreal,  and  Edmonton,  respectively.  This  is  due  to  the  use  of  heat  pump   mechanical  systems  in  Case  B  (Electric).  The  air-to-air  heat  pump  system  selected   uses  electrical  energy  to  move  heat  from  outside  air  to  the  conditioned  space  with   COPs  greater  than  1.  Therefore,  heat  pumps  require  less  site  energy  than  natural  gas   equipment  to  cover  the  same  space  heating  demand.  It  should  be  noted  that  the   advantage  in  efficiency  of  energy  conversion  held  by  Case  B  (Electric)  is  lost  when   factoring  in  the  conversion  from  source  energy  to  site  energy.  The  difference  is  even   more  important  in  locations  where  the  majority  of  electricity  is  generated  through   combustion  of  thermal  fuels,  since  a  large  proportion  of  energy  in  the  fuel  is  lost  as   heat  during  conversion  to  electricity,  while  natural  gas  mechanical  heating  systems   convert  the  fuel  directly  into  heat  with  very  high  efficiency.    

  63  

   For  both  Cases  A  and  B,  Toronto  had  the  lowest  energy  consumption,  while   Edmonton  had  the  highest.  This  is  due  to  Toronto  having  the  lowest  number  of   heating  degree  days  (3873)  compared  with  Montreal  (4363)  and  Edmonton  (5637)   and  consequently  the  lowest  annual  heat  demand  of  the  three  locations  assessed   (Table  5-7).

   Figure  5-2  compares  the  impact  that  location  and  mechanical  system  choice   have  on  building  life  cycle  operating  GWP.  The  reference  building  modeled  for   Edmonton  with  Case  A  (NG)  mechanicals  had  higher  life  cycle  operating  GWP  than   Toronto  (225%)  and  Montreal  (358%),  while  the  same  building  with  Case  B   (Electric)  mechanicals  had  432%  and  6,610%  greater  emissions  than  Toronto  and   Montreal,  respectively.  The  reference  building  modeled  for  Montreal  had  the  lowest   operating  GWP  impact  for  both  mechanical  system  types,  despite  having  higher   operating  energy  consumption  than  Toronto  for  both  Case  A  (NG)  and  B  (Figure   5-1).  This  is  due  to  Montreal  having  access  to  electricity  with  the  lowest  carbon   intensity  of  the  three  locations.  Even  for  Case  A  (NG),  where  heat  and  hot  water  are   supplied  via  natural  gas,  the  lower  carbon  intensity  of  the  electricity  used  to  power   the  auxiliary  equipment  in  Montreal  results  in  sufficient  reductions  to  overcome  the   impact  of  additional  GWP  arising  from  the  higher  heating  requirements.

Figure  5-2  Impact  of  Location  and  Mechanical  System  Choice  on  Life  Cycle  Operating  GWP  

Natural  gas-fuelled  (Case  A)  mechanicals  produced  higher  life  cycle   operating  GWP  than  electricity-based  mechanical  systems  (Case  B)  for  both  Toronto   (116  vs.  91  MgCO2eq)  and  Montreal  (73  vs.  6  MgCO2eq).  Case  B  (Electric)  was  found   to  generate  only  78.4%  and  8.1%  of  the  emissions  of  Case  A  (NG)  for  Toronto  and   Montreal,  respectively.  However,  the  opposite  is  true  in  Edmonton  (262  vs.  394   MgCO2eq),  where  the  Case  B  (Electric)  mechanical  system  generated  150.1%   greater  GWP  compared  to  the  Case  A  (NG)  system.  Despite  the  efficiency  of  heat   pump  electric  mechanicals,  their  application  in  regions  with  high  carbon  electricity   sources  yielded  greater  operating  GWP  than  natural  gas  mechanical  systems.     These  findings  reflect  the  current  carbon  intensities  of  electrical  grids  and   natural  gas  for  the  locations  assessed.  As  regional  energy  supplies  change,  so  to  will   their  carbon  impacts.  Athena  IE  electricity  generation  carbon  intensity  values  used   to  determine  the  operating  GWP  account  for  upstream  impacts  due  to  primary   extraction  of  the  resource  consumed,  along  with  production,  delivery  and  use  of   electricity  (Athena,  2014a).

   included  in  Table  5-8,  along  with  the  historic  downstream  electricity  carbon   intensities.  Historic  downstream  values  from  Environment  Canada  (2014b)   presented  in  the  Table  are  significantly  different  from  Athena  IE  values  due  to   differences  in  life  cycle  system  boundaries  used  in  the  respective  emissions   accounting  methods.  Environment  Canada  values  only  account  for  carbon  emissions   incurred  during  electricity  production  and  transportation,  thereby  excluding  any   upstream  impacts  from  resource  extraction  and  processing  (Environment  Canada,   2014c).  However,  these  historic  values  were  included  to  illustrate  that  electricity   carbon  intensities  can  change  greatly  in  a  short  period  of  time.

   In  Ontario  for  example,  the  carbon  intensity  dropped  66%  in  10  years,  which   is  well  within  the  life  span  of  mechanical  equipment.  This  would  significantly  impact   the  operating  emissions  outcome  of  a  building  and  potentially  change  the   importance  of  decisions  made  during  the  building  design  phase.  Thus,  decisions   made  about  mechanical  systems  should  reflect  both  current  and  anticipated  carbon   intensities  of  the  energy  carrier  selected  over  the  expected  lifespan  of  the   equipment.     It  should  also  be  noted  that  since  this  analysis  was  limited  to  examining  the   climate  impacts  of  only  two  mechanical  systems,  inclusion  of  other  heating  systems   and  examination  of  additional  environmental  indicators  might  yield  different   findings.    Nevertheless,  the  finding  that  large  difference  in  operating  GWP  between  

  66  

   locations  and  mechanical  system  scenarios  exist  indicates  that  a  regional  based   method  for  determining  operating  GWP  is  undoubtedly  required.        Significance  of  Envelope  Life  Cycle  Embodied  GWP  and  Operating  GWP   Results  comparing  envelope  embodied  GWP  with  operating  GWP  for  Toronto,   Montreal  and  Edmonton  are  summarized  in  Figure  5-3.  The  significance  of  envelope   embodied  GWP  was  evaluated  in  terms  of  net  life  cycle  GWP  emissions  of  the   envelope  (herein  referred  to  as  life  cycle  GWP),  which  includes  building  operating   GWP.

   For  Configuration  1,  envelope  assemblies  in  both  Toronto  and  Montreal  have   a  damping  influence  on  life  cycle  GWP  for  each  mechanical  system  permutation,   with  the  negative  embodied  GWP  resulting  in  a  decrease  in  life  cycle  GWP.  The   largest  damping  effect  occurs  in  Montreal  for  the  electrically  powered  mechanical   system  (Case  B),  where  the  envelope  decreases  the  total  life  cycle  GWP  by  36%.  This   is  due  to  the  all-electric  mechanical  system  consuming  electricity  from  a  grid  with   very  low  carbon  intensity,  resulting  in  low  operating  GWP.  The  reference  building   located  in  Edmonton  with  natural  gas  mechanicals  yielded  the  largest  increase  in   GWP  relative  to  the  other  permutations  assessed  for  Configuration  1.  However,  at   only  1%  of  life  cycle  GWP,  the  impact  of  the  envelope  embodied  GWP  is  insignificant   when  compared  with  operating  GWP.  Therefore,  the  combination  of  low  embodied   GWP  insulation  and  cladding  can  help  to  reduce  the  overall  life  cycle  carbon  burden   of  buildings  and  even  negate  some  of  the  operating  impacts  in  locations  with  low   carbon  electricity.     Envelope  embodied  GWP  in  envelope  Configuration  2,  which  was  comprised   of  high-embodied  GWP  insulation  and  low  embodied  GWP  cladding,  yielded  slightly   larger  impacts  on  life  cycle  GWP  for  Toronto  and  Edmonton.  However,  permutations   for  both  mechanical  system  cases  in  Montreal  still  reduced  the  overall  life  cycle  GWP   with  respect  to  operating  GWP,  with  Case  B  (Electric)  again  yielding  a  large   reduction  in  total  emissions  of  10%.  For  Toronto  and  Edmonton,  the  proportion  of  

  68  

   life  cycle  emissions  attributable  to  the  building  envelope  ranged  between  2%  and   4%,  which  was  still  insignificant  compared  to  the  impact  of  operating  GWP.          Results  for  all  permutations  using  envelope  Configuration  3,  with  high   embodied  GWP  insulation  and  cladding,  increased  the  overall  life  cycle  GWP.  At   133%,  embodied  GWP  had  the  largest  effect  on  life  cycle  GWP  in  Montreal  for  heat   pump  electric  mechanical  systems  due  to  the  very  low  operating  GWP  of  this   scenario.  Envelope  embodied  GWP  was  lowest  relative  impact  on  life  cycle  GWP  for   the  scenario  in  Edmonton  using  electric  mechanical  systems  (5%),  due  to  the  very   high  operating  GWP  for  this  case.     These  results  indicate  that  envelope  embodied  GWP  does  not  have  a   significant  impact  when  compared  to  operating  emissions  for  all  locations  and   mechanical  systems  except  for  the  Case  B  (Electric)  mechanical  system  in  Montreal.   Therefore,  as  the  operating  GWP  impacts  are  reduced,  embodied  impacts  become   increasingly  significant  and  deserve  attention  when  attempting  to  minimize  the  life   cycle  carbon  impact  of  buildings.  However,  since  the  envelope  embodied  accounting   in  this  study  was  limited  in  that  the  data  for  materials  is  based  on  aggregated  values   representing  average  regional  embodied  impacts,  the  findings  should  not  be   universally  extended  to  all  buildings  constructed  to  the  Passive  House  Standard.   Rather,  a  full  accounting  of  the  life  cycle  impacts  of  the  building  envelope  should  be   undertaken  using  the  best  available  data  for  the  specific  materials  selected  in  order   to  determine  the  GWP  impact  specific  to  the  building.     These  results  excluded  the  impact  of  high  performance  windows,  which  would   have  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  overall  embodied  GWP  of  the  envelope.  Furthermore,   including  embodied  impacts  of  interior  finishes,  fixtures,  appliances  and  mechanical   systems  in  the  assessment  would  also  result  in  a  significant  increase  in  overall   embodied  GWP.  Studies  by  Passer  et  al.  (2012)  and  Stephan,  Crawford,  and  de   Myttenaere  (2013)  comparing  operating  and  embodied  impacts  of  buildings   constructed  to  the  Passive  House  Standard  have  determined  that  whole  building   embodied  impacts  can  make  up  a  significant  proportion  of  the  total  life  cycle  impact.   The  extent  to  which  the  embodied  GWP  of  these  non-envelope  related  materials   would  increase  is  highly  dependent  on  the  type  and  nature  of  the  materials  and     69  

   finishes  selected.  For  example,  the  study  by  Passer  et  al.  (2012)  found  that   embodied  energy  of  building  materials  in  a  Passive  House  made  up  31%  of  the  total   life  cycle  impact,  while  the  study  by  Stephan,  Crawford,  and  de  Myttenaere  (2013)   indicated  that  embodied  energy  was  up  to  77%  of  the  total  energy  used  over  the  life   cycle  of  Passive  Houses.     If  the  carbon  sequestration  effect  of  wood  based  materials  in  the  wall  and  roof   assemblies  were  excluded,  the  impact  of  envelope  embodied  GWP  relative  to   operating  emissions  would  be  increased  by  13  MgCO2eq  for  envelope  Configuration   1  in  all  locations.    Configurations  2  and  3  would  increase  to  a  lesser  degree  since   they  do  not  incorporate  cellulose  insulation,  however  the  impact  from  the  structural   wood  based  materials  would  remain.  Therefore  the  gap  in  embodied  GWP  between   the  three  configurations  assessed  would  decrease.        5.1.3 Comparison  of  Passive  House  Standard  and  Regional  Based  Method  Operating   GWP  Results   The  difference  between  Passive  House  Standard  and  Athena  IE  calculated  operating   GWP  was  determined  for  each  location  and  mechanical  system  combination.        A  comparison  of  modeling  results  for  natural  gas  mechanical  systems   revealed  that  the  Passive  House  Standard  calculation  method  significantly   overestimates  operating  GWP  for  Montreal,  while  underestimating  emissions  for   Edmonton  (Table  5-10).  Emissions  for  Toronto  were  also  overestimated,  although   to  a  lesser  extent  than  for  Montreal.  Athena  IE  and  the  Passive  House  Standard   method  both  assume  a  constant  natural  gas  carbon  emission  factor  for  all  of  the   locations  assessed.  Therefore,  the  difference  in  predicted  operating  GWP  between   the  two  calculation  methods  found  is  entirely  due  to  the  electrical  portion  of  the   energy  consumed.  The  Passive  House  Standard  calculation  method  assumes  a  single   electricity  carbon  emission  factor  and  therefore  fails  to  capture  the  regional   differences  in  electricity  carbon  intensity.

A  comparison  of  Athena  IE  and  WUFI  Passive  results  for  all-electric   mechanical  systems  in  Table  5-11  produced  even  larger  deviations  in  predicted   operating  GWP  than  for  the  natural  gas  mechanicals.    The  Passive  House  Standard   calculation  method  overestimates  operating  GWP  for  Montreal  by  a  significant   margin,  while  again  moderately  underestimating  emissions  for  Edmonton.   Emissions  for  Toronto  were  also  overestimated,  although  to  a  lesser  extent  than  for   Montreal.  Deviations  in  the  results  predicted  by  the  Passive  House  Standard   calculation  method  are  greatest  for  heat  pump  electric  mechanical  systems.   Additionally,  the  Passive  House  Standard  method  predicts  that  selecting  Case  B   (Electric)  mechanicals  would  result  in  higher  operating  GWP  than  for  Case  A  (NG)   mechanicals  in  Toronto  and  Montreal,  which  is  opposite  of  what  is  predicted  by   Athena  IE.  Consequently,  designers  cannot  rely  on  using  WUFI  Passive  to  make   decisions  regarding  optimization  of  building  operating  GWP.

   Due  to  geographic  variations  in  the  North  American  electricity  generation   mix  and  the  segregation  of  the  electricity  grid  into  several  distinct  regions,  it  is   recommended  that  the  Passive  House  Standard  be  revised  to  include  region  specific   energy  carbon  intensities.  Additionally,  research  should  be  conducted  into  methods   for  projecting  future  energy  source  carbon  intensities  to  allow  for  increased   accuracy  when  predicting  life  cycle  operating  carbon  impacts.  Implementing  these   changes  would  provide  designers  with  a  tool  that  for  making  informed  decisions   when  evaluating  available  mechanical  system  options  and  would  increase   confidence  that  the  primary  purpose  of  the  standard  is  upheld  regardless  of   location.         

5.2 Envelope  Parametric  Analysis  Results  
5.2.1 Impact  of  Insulation  Thickness  on  Envelope  Embodied  GWP   Assessment  of  the  wall  assembly  for  Configuration  1  yielded  envelope  embodied   GWP  results  with  negative  values  for  wood-clad  assemblies  with  blown-in  cellulose   insulation,  indicating  sequestration  of  carbon  (Figure  5-4,  Figure  5-5  and  Figure   5-6).  Additionally,  as  insulation  thickness  is  increased,  the  amount  of  embodied   GWP  is  reduced.  An  exception  to  this  trend  occurs  at  280  mm  of  insulation   thickness,  where  the  amount  of  embodied  GWP  of  the  wall  assembly  is  increased.  At   this  point  (280  mm),  the  exterior  non-structural  wall  was  increased  from  a   thickness  of  89  mm  to  140  mm  deep.  Beyond  a  thickness  of  280  mm,  the  exterior   wall  structure  is  changed  from  dimensional  lumber  to  manufactured  I-joists.     For  the  wood-clad  assemblies  with  blown-in  fiberglass  insulation   (Configuration  2),  the  wall  assembly  results  in  negative  embodied  GWPs  in  both   Toronto  and  Montreal,  indicating  that  sequestration  of  carbon  occurs  (Figure  5-7,   Figure  5-8  and  Figure  5-9),  however  the  same  assembly  modeled  for  Edmonton   results  in  positive  GWP  values  for  most  insulation  thicknesses,  indicating  a  net   emission  of  carbon  into  the  atmosphere  (Figure  5-10).  Configuration  2  in  Toronto   exhibits  a  flat  trend  of  GWP  with  increasing  insulation  thickness  after  approximately   380  mm  of  insulation,  while  Montreal  has  an  overall  reducing  trend.  Meanwhile,  the     72  

   same  assembly  configuration  in  Edmonton  results  in  an  overall  increasing  trend.   Montreal  has  the  best  outcome  in  assembly  embodied  GWP,  followed  by  Toronto,   while  Edmonton  has  the  poorest  outcome.     Metal-clad  wall  assemblies  with  blown-in  fiberglass  insulation   (Configuration  3)  resulted  in  the  highest  GWP  impact  of  the  three  wall  assembly   configurations  assessed.  All  iterations  yielded  positive  envelope  embodied  GWP   values  for  all  locations  (Figure  5-4,  Figure  5-5  and  Figure  5-6),  indicating  net   emission  of  carbon  into  the  atmosphere.  Configuration  3  in  Toronto  and  Montreal   results  in  an  overall  decreasing  trend  in  GWP  with  increasing  insulation  thickness,   while  Edmonton  has  an  overall  increasing  trend.     Wall  assembly  cladding  selection  was  found  to  have  a  greater  impact  on  wall   assembly  embodied  GWP  than  choice  of  insulation  material  for  all  iterations  in   Toronto  and  Montreal.  In  Edmonton,  wall-cladding  materials  have  the  greatest   impact  on  GWP  until  an  insulation  thickness  of  approximately  500  mm.  Beyond  500   mm,  the  insulation  material  choice  has  a  larger  and  increasing  influence  on   embodied  GWP.     Dimensional  lumber  and  manufactured  I-joists  used  in  the  wall  assemblies   help  to  reduce  the  embodied  GWP  of  the  envelope,  even  when  using  insulation   materials  with  high  embodied  GWP.  Electricity  grid  carbon  intensity  is  the  primary   reason  for  regional  differences  in  embodied  GWP  impact,  while  material   manufacturing  energy  intensity  is  the  reason  for  differences  between  the  three   assembly  configurations,  as  previously  established  through  the  detailed   investigation  in  Section  5.1.1  (p.  54).   These  results  are  limited  in  application  to  the  wall  assembly  assessed,  and   due  to  the  high  proportion  of  dimensional  lumber  used  relative  to  the  envelope   volume,  likely  represents  a  best  case  for  embodied  GWP.  Extending  this  research  to   other  envelope  types  would  prove  valuable,  since  Passive  Houses  can  be   constructed  using  other  wall  assemblies  that  are  comprised  of  significantly  different   materials,  including  structural  insulating  panels,  insulated  concrete  forms,  and   exterior  insulated  concrete  masonry  units.

Figure  5-6  Comparison  of  Edmonton  Wall  Assembly  Material  Type  Embodied  GWP  

  

The  roof  assembly  embodied  GWP  was  assessed  for  both  blown-in  cellulose  

and  blown-in  fiberglass  insulation.  No  changes  to  the  cladding  materials  of  the  roof   assembly  were  made.  Iterations  of  the  roof  assembly  containing  blown-in  cellulose   yielded  negative  values  for  both  Toronto  and  Montreal  (Figure  5-7  and  Figure  5-8).   However,  the  same  insulation  levels  modeled  for  Edmonton  transitioned  from  a   negative  GWP  at  a  thickness  of  approximately  600  mm  (Figure  5-9).     Fiberglass  insulation  was  then  substituted  into  the  roof  assembly  in  place  of   cellulose,  yielding  higher  GWP  in  Toronto  and  significantly  higher  GWP  in   Edmonton.  Although  the  same  insulation  levels  modeled  for  Montreal  resulted  in   slightly  lower  embodied  GWP  beyond  an  insulation  thickness  of  approximately  400   mm,  the  difference  between  fiberglass  and  cellulose  GWPs  were  only  minor.  All   three  locations  exhibited  increases  to  GWP  with  increasing  cellulose  insulation   thickness,  with  only  the  assembly  in  Montreal  able  to  sequester  carbon  for  all   iterations  tested.  The  roof  assembly  was  found  to  only  have  a  significant  impact  on  

  75  

   embodied  GWP  for  locations  with  high  carbon  electricity  when  using  fiberglass   insulation.     Embodied  GWP  for  all  three  locations  and  both  insulation  materials  exhibited   increasing  trends  with  increasing  cellulose  insulation  thickness,  with  the  exception   of  a  single  decrease  at  140  mm  in  all  but  Configuration  2  in  Edmonton.  The  reason   for  this  trend  is  that  a  change  in  the  ceiling  joist  size  occurs  at  140  mm  of  insulation,   thus  using  additional  lumber  which  reduces  the  overall  embodied  GWP.  Beyond  the   140  mm  point,  the  quantity  of  insulation  is  increased  but  the  structure  is  kept  the   same.  Since  the  insulation  materials  are  more  energy  intensive  to  produce  than   lumber,  adding  more  insulation  to  the  assembly  results  in  an  increase  in  embodied   GWP.  This  indicates  that  even  cellulose  insulation  in  Configuration  1  can  increase   the  embodied  carbon  of  the  building.

Embodied  GWP  results   for  both  slab  assembly  insulation  materials  yielded  positive  values  for  all  insulation   thicknesses,  indicating  a  release  of  carbon  into  the  atmosphere  over  the  assembly's   60-year  lifespan  (Figure  5-10,  Figure  5-11  and  Figure  5-12).    An  increasing  trend  in   embodied  GWP  is  evident  as  insulation  levels  are  increased.     Wall  cladding  material  selection  has  a  greater  impact  on  embodied  GWP  than   insulation  material  type  in  both  Toronto  and  Montreal,  while  wall  cladding  material   has  the  greatest  impact  on  GWP  in  Edmonton  until  an  insulation  thickness  of   approximately  500  mm.  Beyond  this  point,  insulation  choice  has  a  greater  impact  on   embodied  GWP.   An  assessment  of  the  modeling  results  indicates  that  EPS  has  a  lower  GWP   impact  than  XPS  at  all  insulation  thicknesses,  with  the  difference  in  GWP  between   the  two  insulation  materials  progressively  increasing  as  insulation  thickness  is     78  

   increased.  Slab  assembly  iterations  assessed  for  both  EPS  and  XPS  have  the  lowest   embodied  GWP  in  Montreal,  followed  by  Toronto,  then  Edmonton.  For  all  of  the   cases  evaluated,  the  embodied  GWP  impact  of  the  concrete  slab  (denoted  by  data   points  for  an  insulation  thickness  of  0  mm)  is  greater  than  the  impact  of  insulation.

        Montreal  had  the  lowest  embodied  GWP  for  all  assembly  insulation  and  

cladding  configurations  assessed,  while  Edmonton  had  the  highest  embodied  GWP.   Materials  traditionally  known  to  result  in  a  higher  envelope  embodied  GWP  were   confirmed  to  do  so  for  all  cases  assessed  except  for  the  roof  assembly  in  Montreal.   Significant  increases  in  embodied  GWP  were  seen  in  all  locations  when  changing   slab  assembly  insulation  from  EPS  to  XPS,  however,  the  impact  of  concrete  in  the   slab  assembly  was  larger  than  the  impact  of  both  EPS  and  XPS  for  all  insulation   thicknesses  assessed.  This  indicates  that  limiting  the  use  of  concrete  would  yield  a   much  greater  impact  on  embodied  GWP  than  selecting  a  low  carbon  insulation   material.        When  designing  low  carbon  buildings,  insulation  and  cladding  materials   should  be  selected  based  on  the  amount  of  energy  required  to  manufacture  them.   Although  this  research  did  not  consider  the  relative  impact  of  different  structural   materials,  the  difference  in  impact  found  between  the  roof  and  wall  assemblies,   which  consisted  of  dimensional  lumber,  and  the  slab  assembly,  comprised  of   concrete,  indicates  that  the  structure  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  total   embodied  carbon  of  the  envelope.  Therefore,  further  investigation  into  different   assembly  structural  materials  is  required.      5.2.2 Impact  of  Insulation  Thickness  on  Building  Life  Cycle  Global  Warming  Potential   Results  from  the  calculation  of  relative  envelope  life  cycle  GWP  were  plotted  against   assembly  insulation  thickness  for  Case  A  (NG)  and  Case  B  (Electric).  All  values   reported  in  the  following  figures  are  relative  to  the  respective  reference  building   assemblies,  which  are  plotted  on  the  x-axis  for  y  =  0.  Data  points  for  assemblies  with   no  insulation  were  excluded  from  the  figures,  since  they  were  all  one  order  of   magnitude  larger  than  other  data  points  and  would  have  made  it  difficult  to  discern   trends  in  the  data.       When  examining  the  relative  life  cycle  GWP  of  the  wall  assemblies  in  Figure   5-13,  the  largest  reductions  occur  when  increasing  insulation  from  140  mm  to  229   mm.  This  represents  the  addition  of  an  89  mm  exterior  wall  to  single  140  mm  

  81  

   structural  stud  wall.  Changing  the  exterior  wall  to  140  mm  for  a  total  insulation   depth  of  280  mm  achieves  only  a  modest  reduction.  However,  changing  the  external   wall  to  a  240  mm  (9.5  inch)  deep  I-joist  configuration  results  in  a  second  significant   decrease  in  life  cycle  GWP.  Additional  increases  in  I-joist  depth  beyond  240  mm,   successively  produce  smaller  reductions  in  GWP.  Results  for  Toronto  and  Montreal   follow  identical  trends,  whereas  the  wall  assemblies  modeled  for  Edmonton  yield   greater  reductions  than  the  same  assemblies  modeled  for  the  other  two  locations.   The  effect  of  diminishing  returns  in  carbon  reductions  with  increasing  insulation   thickness  is  evident,  with  reductions  in  emissions  tapering  significantly  as   insulation  is  increased  beyond  the  reference  building  envelope  level.

Figure  5-13  Case  A  (NG):  Impact  of  Wall  Insulation  Thickness  on  Life  Cycle  GWP  

For  the  roof  assembly  iterations  in  Figure  5-14,  the  largest  reductions  in  life   cycle  GWP  occur  with  the  first  increase  in  insulation  thickness.  The  first  two  data   points  represent  a  change  in  ceiling  service  cavity  depth  from  89  mm  to  140  mm.   Beyond  an  insulation  thickness  of  approximately  550  mm,  very  little  additional  

  82  

   reduction  in  life  cycle  GWP  occurs  for  all  locations.  Once  again,  Edmonton  has   slightly  larger  relative  reductions  compared  to  the  other  two  locations.  GWP   reductions  are  severely  limited  for  insulation  increments  beyond  the  reference   building  envelope.  The  effect  is  more  pronounced  than  for  wall  assembly  insulation.   The  underlying  reason  behind  the  discrepancy  between  the  wall  and  roof   assemblies  is  due  to  the  greater  damping  effect  on  embodied  GWP  due  to  the  wall   assembly  structure,  as  previously  identified  in  the  embodied  GWP  analysis  (Section   5.2.1).

   Figure  5-14  Case  A  (NG):  Impact  of  Roof  Insulation  Thickness  on  Life  Cycle  GWP    

Case  A  (NG)  slab  assembly  results  in  Figure  5-15  follow  a  very  similar  trend   to  the  roof  assembly  iterations,  with  the  impact  of  diminishing  returns  indicated  by   the  nearly  flat  slope  towards  the  higher  end  of  insulation  thickness.  Once  again,   Edmonton  slab  assembly  iterations  produced  moderately  larger  reductions  in  GWP   than  for  Montreal  and  Toronto.  For  all  locations,  very  little  reduction  in  life  cycle   GWP  was  attained  when  moving  beyond  200  mm  of  insulation  beneath  the  slab.     83  

   Therefore,  once  the  slab  insulation  reaches  approximately  200  mm,  attention  should   shift  to  increasing  the  insulation  thickness  of  the  wall  or  roof  assemblies.

These  results  indicate  that  when  using  natural  gas  mechanicals,  the  amount  

of  GWP  associated  with  heat  loss  through  the  slab  assembly  become  insignificant   relative  to  the  additional  embodied  GWP  from  increasing  the  insulation  thickness.   This  is  true  for  all  locations  independent  of  climate,  which  is  significant,  since   designing  to  meet  an  energy  intensity  target,  such  as  the  Passive  House  Standard   annual  heat  demand,  without  considering  GWP  would  result  in  insulating  the  slab   beyond  the  point  where  significant  carbon  reductions  are  realized.   Case  B  (Electric)  represents  the  use  of  electricity  for  space  conditioning  and   domestic  hot  water  production.  Results  of  iterative  modeling  for  the  wall  assembly   (Figure  5-16),  indicate  that  Edmonton  has  the  largest  opportunity  for  reductions  in   GWP  beyond  the  reference  building  assembly  insulation  level.  Comparatively   smaller  reductions  are  possible  for  Toronto,  while  increasing  insulation  beyond  the  

  84  

   reference  building  assembly  level  yields  no  significant  reductions  to  life  cycle  GWP   in  Montreal.  Figure  5-16  was  re-plotted  in  Figure  5-17  without  data  for  Edmonton  to   identify  trends  in  the  Toronto  and  Montreal  data.  Trend  lines  for  both  Toronto  and   Montreal  indicate  that  the  insulation  level  for  the  respective  reference  building   walls  are  nearly  ideal,  since  increasing  the  insulation  beyond  this  point  would  yield   minimal  carbon  reductions,  while  decreasing  the  insulation  to  the  next  lowest   increment  would  significantly  increase  the  impact  on  life  cycle  carbon.  Interestingly,   this  point  is  where  the  exterior  insulation  cavity  changes  from  a  double-stud  to  a   manufactured  I-joist  configuration.  The  I-joist  is  able  to  hold  more  insulation  while   reducing  thermal  bridging  due  to  the  thin  cross-sectional  profile  of  the  I-joist  OSB   web.  Subsequent  increases  in  insulation  cavity  depth  are  accomplished  by   increasing  the  web  depth  of  the  I-joist.  This  allows  for  more  insulation  but  does  not   significantly  contribute  to  increasing  the  quantity  of  wood  in  the  structure,  thus   reducing  the  carbon  sequestering  benefit  of  the  structure  relative  to  the  impact  of   the  insulation.

   Results  for  the  roof  assembly  in  Figure  5-18  indicate  that  Edmonton  exhibits   the  highest  reductions  in  GWP  with  increasing  insulation  thickness.  Toronto  has   only  modest  reductions,  while  insulation  thickness  has  almost  now  impact  on  life   cycle  GWP  in  Montreal.  Data  for  Toronto  and  Montreal  was  re-plotted  in  Figure  5-19   to  better  discern  any  trends  present.  Closer  analysis  of  Toronto  reveals  that   insulating  the  roof  beyond  the  reference  building  level  does  little  to  reduce  life  cycle   GWP.  In  fact,  the  insulation  level  could  be  decreased  to  440  mm  without   significantly  increasing  the  impact.  Increasing  the  insulation  of  the  roof  assembly   beyond  240  mm  in  Montreal  has  a  negligible  impact  on  life  cycle  GWP.

   Slab  assembly  results  in  Figure  5-20  again  indicated  that  Edmonton  exhibits   the  highest  reductions  in  GWP  with  increasing  insulation  thickness.  These  results   were  also  re-plotted  for  only  Montreal  and  Toronto  data  to  better  discern  trends   (Figure  5-21).  Reductions  in  life  cycle  GWP  for  Toronto  seriously  diminish  for   insulation  increases  beyond  200  mm.  Reductions  in  life  cycle  GWP  are  not  feasible   beyond  the  reference  building  level  (254  mm),  since  an  inflection  point  is  reached  at   350  mm,  after  which  the  impact  on  life  cycle  carbon  is  increased.  For  Montreal,  this   inflection  point  occurs  even  earlier,  between  100  and  150  mm  of  insulation,   indicating  the  decreasing  the  insulation  from  reference  building  levels  would  yield  a   net  decrease  in  life  cycle  GWP.

   All  assemblies  for  both  Case  A  (NG)  and  Case  B  (Electric)  mechanical  systems   show  evidence  of  diminishing  returns,  which  progressively  diminishes  the  impact   that  adding  insulation  has  on  the  reducing  the  GWP  of  the  assembly.  The  greatest   opportunity  for  further  reductions  in  life  cycle  GWP  beyond  the  reference  building   exist  for  the  wall  assembly  in  Edmonton.  Relatively  small  reductions  can  be  realized   for  Toronto,  while  no  significant  potential  for  reductions  exist  for  Montreal.  This   trend  holds  true  for  both  roof  and  slab  assemblies,  although  the  reductions  in  life   cycle  GWP  to  be  had  are  less  than  the  reductions  available  for  wall  assemblies.     Both  Case  A  (NG)  and  Case  B  (Electric)  results  indicate  that  wall  assemblies   offer  the  largest  opportunity  for  decreasing  life  cycle  GWP,  while  slab  assemblies   offer  the  smallest  savings.  This  is  in  part  due  to  the  relative  surface  areas  of  the   assemblies.  Since  walls  make  up  a  proportionately  larger  fraction  of  surface  area   than  the  roof  and  slab  assemblies,  the  amount  of  heat  transferred  through  the  wall   assembly  will  also  be  larger.  Additionally,  although  the  slab  and  roof  assemblies   have  very  similar  surface  areas,  the  slab  assembly  is  in  direct  contact  with  the   ground.  The  buffering  impact  of  the  soil  results  in  a  lower  temperature  differential   between  the  interior  and  exterior  surfaces  of  the  slab  assembly,  thereby  reducing   heat  transfer.     As  previously  determined  in  Section  5.1.2  (p.  62),  the  impact  of  the  low   electricity  carbon  intensity  in  Montreal  outweighs  the  increased  heating   requirements  when  examining  operating  GWP.  Additionally,  Case  B  (Electric)   building  assemblies  modeled  for  Edmonton  yield  significantly  larger  reductions  in   GWP  with  increasing  insulation  than  the  same  assemblies  modeled  for  Montreal  or   Toronto.  This  is  due  to  Edmonton  being  located  in  an  electrical  distribution  region   with  high  carbon  intensity.     It  should  be  noted  that  results  of  this  analysis  are  limited  to  the  specific   building  geometry  investigated.  Changes  to  building  geometry  would  result  in   changes  to  the  proportion  of  overall  heat  transfer  of  each  assembly,  consequently   altering  the  impact  that  each  assembly  has  on  the  total  building  life  cycle  GWP.     Therefore,  further  research  into  the  sensitivity  of  life  cycle  GWP  to  building   geometry  is  warranted.       91  

     

5.3 Envelope  Life  Cycle  Optimization  Results  
5.3.1 Selection  of  Envelope  Scenarios  Based  on  Life  Cycle  GWP   Results  are  presented  in  Table  5-12  through  5-19  indicate  that,  for  all  assemblies,   diminishing  reductions  in  assembly  life  cycle  GWP  occur  when  insulation  thickness   is  increased.  Each  assembly  was  evaluated  against  the  -50  kg  CO2eq/mm  threshold   or  the  alternative  criterion  if  this  threshold  was  not  reached,  as  described  in  Section   4.7.1  (p.  48).  Three  data  points  were  selected,  as  denoted  by  bold  font.  The   threshold  value  was  not  reached  in  the  initial  data  set  generated  for  Edmonton's   wall  assemblies  in  Case  B  (Electric),  therefore  the  data  set  was  increased  by  two   insulation  increments  and  re-evaluated.  Although  the  threshold  value  was  not   reached  when  the  additional  increments  were  evaluated,  the  results  were  the  same   for  two  consecutive  insulation  levels,  meeting  the  alternative  selection  criterion   (Table  5-15).  There  was  a  decrease  in  the  last  data  point  over  the  previous  one,   however  trends  in  the  data  for  the  same  assembly  located  in  Toronto  and  Montreal   indicate  that  the  results  begin  to  oscillate  around  a  point,  without  changing   significantly  with  additional  insulation  increments.  The  alternative  selection   criterion  was  also  met  for  Edmonton's  Case  B  slab  assembly  (Table  5-17).  A  data   point  was  discovered  for  Montreal  Case  B  (Electric)  wall  (Table  5-16)  that  did  not  fit   the  expected  trend  in  that  a  large  increase  in  GWP  occurred  when  wall  insulation   was  increased  from  229  mm  to  280  mm,  whereas  a  decrease  in  GWP  was  seen  for   the  other  two  locations.  Therefore  an  additional  scenario  was  created  to  capture  the   impact  that  this  data  point  has.

Scenarios  for  Case  A  (NG)  and  Case  B  (Electric)  were  selected  along  with  the  

respective  assembly  insulation  thicknesses  are  summarized  in  Table  5-18.  A  total  of   19  scenarios  were  selected  for  further  modeling  as  per  the  method  described  in   Section  4.7.3  (p.  52).    When  compared  to  one  another,  the  selected  assembly   configurations  are  similar  for  most  permutations  of  location  and  mechanical  system,   with  the  exception  of  the  assemblies  chosen  for  Case  B  (Electric)  in  Montreal  and   Edmonton,  which  were  found  to  have  significantly  lower  and  higher  levels  of   insulation,  respectively.

Figure  5-24  Case  A:  Relationship  Between  Life  Cycle  GWP  and  Annual  Heat  Demand  

   Slope  values  for  Case  A  (NG)  mechanical  systems  are  nearly  the  same  for   Toronto  and  Edmonton,  while  the  slope  for  Montreal  is  slightly  lower.  For  Case  A   (NG),  changing  the  building  annual  heat  demand  by  1  kWh/m2-yr  produces  a  change   in  life  cycle  GWP  of  approximately  2  Mg  CO2eq.  This  indicates  that  implementing   measures  that  reduce  the  rate  of  heat  loss,  such  as  increasing  envelope  thermal   resistance,  airtightness,  and  ventilation  system  efficiency  are  effective  at  reducing   life  cycle  carbon  emissions.  It  also  validates  the  Passive  House  Standard  AHD   criteria  as  an  effective  method  for  reducing  the  carbon  impact  of  buildings  when   using  natural  gas  mechanical  systems.     The  analysis  was  limited  to  assessing  the  impacts  of  the  building  envelope   configuration  with  low  embodied  GWP.  It  should  be  noted  that  selecting  insulation   and  cladding  materials  with  higher  embodied  GWP  could  have  a  significant  impact   on  the  relationship  between  AHD  and  life  cycle  GWP,  especially  in  locations  with  low  

102     

   electricity  grid  carbon  intensities.  Therefore,  expanding  the  investigation  to   determine  the  sensitivity  of  GWP  to  envelope  material  choice  is  recommended.

Figure  5-25  Case  B:  Relationship  Between  Life  Cycle  GWP  and  Annual  Heat  Demand  

   The  slope  values  determined  for  Case  B  (Electric)  mechanical  systems  were   significantly  different  from  Case  A  (NG)  and  between  locations.  AHD  and  life  cycle   GWP  have  a  near-proportional  (1:1)  relationship  in  Toronto.  Adjusting  the  AHD  of  a   building  in  Montreal  produces  very  little  change  in  life  cycle  GWP,  while  the   opposite  is  true  for  Edmonton,  where  altering  the  AHD  has  a  significant  impact  on   life  cycle  GWP.  The  link  between  electricity  grid  carbon  intensity  and  life  cycle  GWP   is  clear,  with  the  majority  of  emissions  arising  due  to  operating  impacts  for  regions   with  high  electricity  carbon  intensity.  An  additional  component  for  the  disparity   between  locations  is  due  to  the  differences  in  backup  electric  resistance  heating   required  to  meet  the  heating  demand.  Toronto  did  not  require  backup  heating,   while  for  Edmonton,  13%  of  the  total  heat  demand  was  supplied  by  backup  heat.

The  Passive  House  Standard  criterion  for  AHD  is  very  effective  at  achieving  its   goal  of  carbon  reductions  in  locations  with  high  electricity  grid  carbon  intensities,   while  the  AHD  criterion  does  not  produce  meaningful  reductions  in  locations  with   low  electricity  grid  carbon  intensities.  Despite  this  finding,  the  electricity  saved  in   low  carbon  regions  such  as  Quebec  could  allow  for  increased  exports  to   neighbouring  regions,  thereby  resulting  in  a  reduction  of  building  operating  GWP  in   regions  outside  of  Quebec.  Therefore,  the  complexities  of  inter-regional  electricity   grid  dynamics  and  the  associated  impact  on  building  life  cycle  GWP  are  areas   requiring  further  investigation  in  order  to  increase  the  accuracy  in  predicting  the   impact  of  constructing  to  the  Passive  House  Standard.  Furthermore,  although  not   assessed  in  this  study,  consideration  of  the  additional  advantages  of  constructing  to   the  Passive  House  Standard  such  as  increased  occupant  comfort  and  envelope   durability,  can  provide  further  justification  for  super  insulating  buildings.

6 Conclusions  and  Recommendations  
The  investigation  of  life  cycle  carbon  impacts  of  Passive  House  building  envelopes   yielded  several  important  findings.    First  off,  the  impact  of  envelope  material  choice   on  life  cycle  GWP  was  found  to  be  greatest  in  locations  with  access  to  low  carbon   electricity  when  electric  based  mechanicals  are  used,  while  having  a  negligible   impact  in  regions  supplied  by  high  carbon  electricity  when  either  natural  gas  or   electric  mechanicals  are  used.  Hence,  optimization  of  envelope  embodied  GWP   should  be  a  main  consideration  for  buildings  located  in  regions  with  access  to  low   carbon  energy,  while  priority  should  be  given  to  reducing  operating  GWP  for   buildings  in  regions  with  high  carbon  energy  sources.     An  assessment  of  the  GWP  impact  of  different  envelope  materials  indicated   that  wall  cladding  material  choice  could  have  a  larger  influence  on  envelope   embodied  GWP  than  insulation  choice,  especially  in  regions  with  low  carbon   electricity.  Additionally,  the  investigation  found  that  assemblies  primarily   incorporating  wood  products  for  structure,  insulation  and  cladding  reduce  the  total   life  cycle  GWP  of  buildings  if  sourced  from  regions  with  low  carbon  electricity.  It  is   important  to  note  that  this  finding  is  only  valid  if  wood  materials  are  obtained  from   sources  with  sustainable  forestry  practices  in  place  (Nunery  &  Keeton,  2010).  Also,   since  this  study  was  based  on  average  regional  embodied  GWP  impacts  and  did  not   investigate  the  impact  of  windows,  a  complete  case-specific  accounting  of  life  cycle   GWP  impacts  may  yield  different  outcomes.  Moreover,  expanding  the  study  to   include  embodied  impacts  of  interior  finishes,  fixtures,  appliances  and  mechanical   systems  may  indicate  that  one  of  these  building  components  have  a  greater   influence  on  total  life  cycle  GWP  than  the  building  envelope  or  operating  impacts.     An  analysis  of  the  impact  that  insulation  thickness  has  on  envelope  life  cycle   GWP  found  that  all  permutations  of  location  and  mechanical  system  type  yield   diminishing  returns  in  life  cycle  GWP  reductions  with  increasing  insulation   thickness.  Buildings  located  in  areas  with  high  carbon  electricity  sources  were  found   to  offer  the  greatest  opportunity  for  further  reductions  in  envelope  life  cycle  GWP  

105     

   beyond  reference  building  insulation  levels,  while  increasing  envelope  insulation  in   locations  with  access  to  low  carbon  electricity  was  found  to  have  insignificant   impacts  on  life  cycle  GWP.  These  results  corroborate  the  findings  of  research   conducted  by  Bowick  (2011),  which  indicated  that  climate  and  fuel  mix  have  the   greatest  influence  on  life  cycle  GWP.        A  comparison  of  mechanical  systems  indicated  that  using  electric  heat  pumps   for  space  heat  and  domestic  hot  water  in  locations  with  low  carbon  electricity   results  in  fewer  operating  emissions  than  using  a  natural  gas  combined  boiler   system.  Furthermore,  this  study  predicted  that  natural  gas  mechanical  systems  are   better  at  reducing  the  operating  GWP  impact  of  buildings  constructed  to  the  Passive   House  Standard  in  locations  where  electricity  is  supplied  from  high  carbon  sources.   However,  changes  to  electricity  grid  carbon  intensity  over  the  mechanical   equipment  life  span  may  result  in  significant  deviations  in  predicted  operating  GWP.   Thus,  decisions  made  about  mechanical  systems  should  reflect  both  current  and   anticipated  carbon  intensities  of  the  energy  carrier  selected  over  the  expected   lifespan  of  the  equipment.     Although  this  study  indicates  that  only  small  reductions  in  carbon  emissions   are  realized  from  building  to  the  Passive  House  Standard  within  the  region  of   Quebec,  the  impact  of  exporting  low  carbon  electricity  was  not  taken  into  account.  It   may  be  that  the  electricity  saved  by  building  to  the  Standard  would  allow  for  an   increase  in  exports  to  neighbouring  regions,  thus  helping  to  reduce  the  carbon   impact  of  buildings  elsewhere.  Therefore,  the  complexities  of  inter-regional   electricity  grid  dynamics  and  the  associated  impact  on  building  life  cycle  GWP  are   areas  requiring  further  investigation  to  more  accurately  assess  the  life  cycle  GWP   impact  of  constructing  to  the  Passive  House  Standard.  Furthermore,  several  other   important  reasons  exist  for  encouraging  the  design  of  super-insulated  envelopes,   including  their  contribution  to  high  levels  of  indoor  air  quality  by  eliminating   conditions  favourable  for  mould  growth  and  ensuring  occupant  comfort  by   maintaining  interior  envelope  surface  temperatures  close  to  the  indoor  air   temperature  (Cotterrell  &  Dadeby,  2012).    

106     

      When  compared  with  a  region  specific  method  for  determining  operating  

GWP,  the  Passive  House  Standard  calculation  method  was  found  to  significantly   overestimate  emissions  of  natural  gas  mechanical  systems  for  locations  with  low   carbon  electricity,  while  also  moderately  underestimating  emissions  for  locations   with  high  carbon  electricity.  The  departure  in  results  between  the  two  methods  was   found  to  be  even  greater  for  heat  pump  electric  mechanical  systems.  Therefore,  the   single  North  American  carbon  emission  factor  used  in  the  Passive  House  Standard   method  should  not  be  relied  upon  when  evaluating  operating  GWP  of  mechanical   system  options.  Incorporation  of  regional  based  electricity  grid  carbon  emission   factors  into  the  Passive  House  Standard  would  assist  designers  in  selecting   mechanical  systems  and  fuel  types  with  lower  life  cycle  operating  carbon  impacts,   thus  satisfying  the  underlying  principle  of  the  Passive  House  Standard.

7 Future  Work  
Since  the  application  of  life  cycle  assessment  to  Passive  House  buildings  is  quite   recent,  the  potential  exists  for  significant  further  research  in  this  area.  The  following   topics  related  to  this  study  have  been  identified  as  requiring  further  investigation:   Â· Expand  the  research  to  include  the  impact  of  imported  specialty  products   and  materials,  such  as  high-performance  windows;   Â· Assess  the  embodied  impact  of  windows,  mechanical  systems  and  the  life   cycle  impact  of  changing  window  to  wall  ratios;   Â· Increase  the  scope  to  include  other  Passive  House  building  typologies  such  as   multi-family  residential  and  institutional;   Â· Analyze  the  impact  of  different  wall  types,  such  as  structural  insulating   panels  and  insulating  concrete  forms;     Â· Evaluate  additional  mechanical  systems  and  fuel  types  suitable  for  Passive   Houses,  such  as  wood  and  hybrid  fuel  systems;     Â· Assess  the  impact  of  onsite  renewable  energy  generation  on  Passive  House   life  cycle  GWP;   Â· Assess  the  sensitivity  of  operating  impacts  to  changes  in  energy  source   carbon  intensity,  and;   Â· Extend  the  operating  GWP  analysis  to  incorporate  inter-regional  electricity   system  dynamics.

According  to  PHIUS  (2014c),  the  maximum  design  ventilation  rate  is  the  greatest  of   the  volumetric,  supply  air,  and  exhaust  air  requirements,  as  determined  by   Equations  A-2  through  A-7.  The  maximum  ventilation  rate  was  then  used  as  the   upper  limit  for  the  ventilation  utilization  pattern  shown  in  Table  A  -  3.  The  fraction   of  design  flow  value  was  based  on  a  ventilation  utilization  pattern  for  verification,   given  by  PHIUS  (2013b).  The  daily  operating  schedule  was  modified  from  the   verification  values  by  increasing  the  "Basic"  operating  time  from  1.5  to  8  hours  and   "Max"  from  0.5  to  2  hours.  This  was  done  to  eliminate  the  model  warning:  "average   air  change  rate  is  very  low".

Mechanical  Systems  
Two  mechanical  systems  evaluated  were  defined  as  follows:     Case  A:   A  natural  gas  combination  boiler  was  selected  to  provide  space  heating   and  DHW,  based  on  consultation  with  S.  Fix,  a  mechanical  engineer   specializing  in  cold-climate  Passive  House  design  (personal   communication,  March  27,  2014).  An  electric  air-to-air  mini-split  heat   pump  was  selected  to  supply  the  air  conditioning  needs.     Case  B:   An  electric  air-to-air  mini-split  heat  pump  was  chosen  for  space  heating   and  air-conditioning,  while  baseboard  electric  resistance  was  used  as  a   backup  source  (to  meet  peak  heat  load  conditions).  An  electric  air-to- water  heat  pump  hot  water  system  was  used  to  supply  the  DHW  needs.

Calculation  of  Cooling  System  Performance   The  dimensionless  coefficient  of  performance  value  is  calculated  from  the   manufacturer's  data  for  energy  efficiency  ratio  (EER),  as  follows  (Fairey,  Parker,   Wilcox,  &  Lombardi,  2004):       !""#$%& =    3.412  /    Where:   COPcooling  =  heat  pump  cooling  season  coefficient  of  performance   EER  =  energy  efficiency  ratio,  BTU/Wh            124

      Ventilation  System    (Case  A  and  Case  B)   The  Ultimate  Air  RecoupAerator  200  DX  ERV  was  selected  to  provide  ventilation   with  efficient  heat  recovery.  Although  the  stated  energy  transfer  efficiency  of  the   unit  is  95%,  it  lacked  certification  from  the  Home  Ventilating  Institute  (HVI),  or  the   Passive  House  Institute.  The  protocol  for  Passive  House  modeling  requires  that   ventilation  equipment  lacking  certification  be  de-rated  to  account  for  in-situ   performance  (PHIUS,  2014c).  Therefore,  the  200  DX  has  a  de-rated  efficiency  of  83%   (UltimateAir,  2014).  The  model  input  parameters  were  kept  constant  between  the   two  mechanical  system  cases,  as  summarized  in  Table  A  -  12.

!    Domestic  Hot  Water  System  (Case  B)      For  Case  B,  an  electric  heat  pump  water  heating  system  was  selected  as  an  energy   efficient  method  of  supplying  domestic  hot  water  using  electricity.  The  specific  unit   used  is  a  GE  GeoSpring  model  GEH50DNSRSA.  According  to  PHIUS  (2013c),  the   annual  COP  of  a  heat  pump  hot  water  system  located  within  the  thermal  envelope  of   a  building  must  be  de-rated  to  account  for  the  heat  that  is  lost  from  the  conditioned   space  to  the  HPWH.  This  is  to  account  for  the  additional  heat  demand  that  must  be   covered  by  the  space  conditioning  system  during  the  heating  season.  The  efficiency   of  the  additionally  required  heat  supplied  to  the  building  depends  on  the  type  of   heating  system  used  (Ibid.).        Calculation  of  HPWH  System  Performance      Space  conditioning  demand  is  covered  by  an  air-to-air  heat  pump  system.  Therefore,   Equation  A  Â­  8  was  used  to  de-rate  the  HPWH  system  annual  COP  to  account  for  the   resulting  increase  in  space  conditioning  demand,  according  to  PHIUS  (2013c).

   Heating  and  Cooling  System  (Case  B)      A  Mitsubishi  Mr.  Slim  Model  MSZ-GE09NA  air-to-air  heat  pump  system  was   specified  to  provide  both  heating  and  cooling  for  Case  B.  The  amount  of  electrical   energy  consumed  by  the  heat  pump  relative  to  the  amount  of  heat  energy   transferred  into  the  conditioned  space  is  known  as  the  Coefficient  of  Performance   (COP)  of  the  system.  WUFI  Passive  requires  an  adjusted  annual  heating  COP  to  be   input  to  account  for  changes  in  performance  when  using  the  equipment  in  a  climate   zone  different  from  the  one  used  by  the  manufacturer  to  obtain  the  COP  value   (PHIUS,  2013c).  Since  this  value  varies  between  climates  it  must  be  determined  for   each  of  the  three  locations  evaluated.

      Calculation  of  Heat  Pump  System  Performance      PHIUS  (2013c)  recommended  the  use  of  a  spreadsheet  calculator  by  DOE  (2012)  to   determine  the  adjusted  heating  season  performance  factor  (HSPF)  for  the  heat   pump  unit.  Calculation  of  the  adjusted  HSPF  was  conducted  using  heating  99%  dry   bulb  winter  design  temperatures  from  Manual  J  (ACCA,  2011),  according  to  the   equation  in  the  spreadsheet  calculator  from  DOE  (2012).  IP  units  were  necessarily   used  due  to  the  empirical  factors  present  in  the  equation  (Equation  A  -  11).

The  fraction  of  backup  electric   resistance  heating  summarized  in  Table  A  -  17  is  calculated  in  the  following  section.

Calculation  of  Backup  Heating  Fraction  
Air-to-air  mini  split  heat  pump  units  are  limited  in  their  ability  to  operate  at   temperatures  below  a  certain  threshold  due  to  the  decreasing  efficiency  in  heat   transfer  with  decreasing  outdoor  air  temperature.  This  threshold  is  known  as  the   low  temperature  cutout  point  of  the  heat  pump  unit,  which  varies  depending  on  the   make  and  model.  A  backup  heating  system  is  required  for  climates  experiencing   wintertime  temperatures  below  the  heating  equipment  cutout  point.  The  backup   system  must  be  capable  of  meeting  the  entire  space  heating  demand  for  periods  

131     

   when  the  heat  pump  is  unable  to  operate.  The  bin  method,  described  by  WemhÃ¶ner   and  Afjei  (2003),  was  used  to  determine  the  fraction  of  backup  heating  required  in   each  location.      For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  electric  resistance  baseboard  heaters  were  selected  to   provide  backup  heating,  representing  a  low  cost  solution  typically  used  in  Passive   House  designs.  It  was  assumed  that  the  set  point  of  the  electric  baseboard  backup   heating  system  was  the  same  as  the  heat  pump  set  point  of  21  Â°C.  For  all  locations   and  scenarios  it  was  assumed  that  the  heat  pump  would  be  able  to  cover  the  entire   building  heating  load  down  to  the  low  temperature  cutout  point.  Therefore,  backup   heating  was  only  used  to  provide  all  heating  below  the  low  temperature  cutout   point  of  the  heat  pump  and  not  used  to  cover  part  of  the  load  above  that  point.  This   is  called  alternate  backup  operation  mode.      STEP  1   A  total  of  7  uniformly  spaced  bins,  representing  temperature  intervals  of  8.3Â°C  were   selected  for  a  total  temperature  range  of  -37.5Â°C  to  20.8Â°C.  The  middle  of  each  bin   temperature  interval  was  used  to  calculate  an  equipment  operation  point  based  on   test  data  from  the  heat  pump  manufacturer.  Intervals  were  selected  based  on  the   manufacturer  test  data  covering  two  operating  points  at  8.3Â°C  and  -8.3Â°C.  The   manufacturer  stated  low  temperature  cutout  point  of  the  heat  pump  is  -20Â°C  (dry- bulb).        The  manufacturer  data  included  values  for  maximum  rated  heating  capacity  and   energy  consumption  at  each  temperature  test  point,  which  allowed  for  calculation  of   the  equipment  COP  at  the  two  operating  points  of  8.3Â°C  and  -8.3Â°C  using  the   following  equation  from  WemhÃ¶ner  and  Afjei  (2003):                =    !!!

   an  approximately  linear  relationship  between  COP  and  heating  operating   temperature.

   statistically  formulated  to  represent  30  years  of  data  similar  to  typical   meteorological  year  (TMY)  data  (Environment  Canada,  2008).        Since  the  CWEC  data  was  provided  in  a  delimited  format,  all  meteorological   observations  for  each  hour  were  represented  as  a  string  of  text  and  numbers  in  a   single  column.  In  order  to  extract  the  dry  bulb  temperature  value,  the  data  had  to  be   split  into  separate  columns  through  the  use  of  excel  functions.        STEP  3   For  each  location,  a  set  of  temperature  bins  was  created,  ranging  from  the  minimum   dry  bulb  temperature  up  to  and  including  18Â°C.  Each  bin  was  selected  to  represent  a   1Â°C  temperature  increment,  and  was  assigned  an  excel  column.  An  excel  "if"   statement  was  used  to  mark  a  column  with  a  "1"  if  the  bin  temperature  was  greater   than  the  hourly  dry  bulb  temperature.  Each  column  was  summed  to  calculate  the   cumulative  number  of  bin  hours  at  each  temperature  increment,  representing  the   number  of  hours  per  year  at  or  below  that  temperature.

Athena  Impact  Estimator  Embodied  GWP  and  Operating  GWP   Modeling  Procedure  
This  section  provides  a  detailed  description  of  the  parameters  input  into  Athena   Impact  Estimator  to  create  the  reference  building  envelope  assemblies  and  includes   the  assumptions  made  and  their  associated  justification.     

General  Inputs  (for  all  assemblies)  
1. Reference  building  envelope  wall,  roof,  and  slab  assemblies  were  created   based  on  the  envelope  section  in  Figure  4-2  (Section  4.3).   2. Toronto  and  Montreal  were  selected  as  the  "Project  Location"  to  represent  2   of  the  3  locations  modeled.  Since  no  data  was  available  for  Edmonton,   Calgary  was  selected  as  a  proxy  for  the  third  location.   3. A  "Building  Life  Expectancy"  of  60  years  was  selected  based  on  literature  by   Himpe  et  al.  (2013),  Bowick  (2011)  and  NRCan  (2007).   4. Values  for  "Operating  Energy  Consumption",  including  electricity  and  natural   gas  usage  were  calculated  from  WUFI  Passive  modelling  results  for  each   envelope  assembly  iteration.     5. After  all  parameters  were  input,  data  output  was  obtained  using  the   "Reports"  for  "All  Summary  Measures".       

Wall  Assembly  Model  
The  following  general  inputs  were  used  to  model  the  reference  building  walls.   A  "Custom  Wall"  type  assembly  was  added  to  the  main  project  to  represent  the   interior  structural  wall.     For  the  "Custom  Wall"  Tab:   Â· A  "Length"  value  for  entering  into  the  Athena  wall  assembly  was  derived   from  the  WUFI  Passive  calculated  surface  area  and  dividing  this  value  by  the   single-storey  height  of  2.82  m  (Athena  "Height"  =  2.82  m)    

137     

   Â· A  "Wood  Stud"  38  x  140  mm,  600  mm  o.c.  load  bearing  wall  was  added  with   plywood  sheathing  to  represent  the  interior  side  structural  wall  of  the   reference  building  design   For  the  "Opening"  tab:   Â· "Number  of  Windows"  =  17  (from  the  reference  building   design)  and  the  "Total  Window  Area  (m2)"  =  20.6  (from  WUFI   Passive).  Although  windows  were  not  modeled  for  the   assemblies,  the  rough  opening  area  was  input  to  account  for   additional  framing  that  would  occur  at  these  junctions.   Â· Â· Â· "Frame  Type"  =  none  (windows  were  not  considered)   "Glazing  Type"  =  none  (windows  were  not  considered)   "Number  of  Doors"  =  1  (from  reference  building  design)  "Door   Type"  =  none  (doors  were  not  considered)   For  wall  assembly  iterations  4  through  9,  a  second  "Custom  Wall"  type  assembly   was  added  to  the  main  project  to  represent  the  exterior  non-structural  wall.     For  the  "Custom  Wall"  Tab:   Â· A  "Length"  value  for  entering  into  the  Athena  wall  assembly  was  derived   from  the  WUFI  Passive  calculated  surface  area  and  dividing  this  value  by  the   single-storey  height  of  2.82  m  (Athena  "Height"  =  2.82  m)     Â· A  "Wood  Stud"  38  x  64  mm,  600  mm  o.c.  non-load  bearing  wall  was  added   with  plywood  sheathing  to  represent  the  exterior  sheathing   For  the  "Opening"  tab:   Â· "Number  of  Windows"  =  17  (from  the  reference  building   design)  and  the  "Total  Window  Area  (m2)"  =  20.6  (from  WUFI   Passive)  Although  windows  were  not  modeled  for  the   assemblies,  the  rough  opening  area  was  input  to  account  for   additional  exterior  wall  framing  that  would  occur  at  these   junctions.   Â·   "Frame  Type"  =  none  (windows  were  not  considered)   138     

   Â· Â· "Glazing  Type"  =  none  (windows  were  not  considered)   "Number  of  Doors"  =  1  (from  reference  building  design)  "Door  Type"  =  none   (doors  were  not  considered)   For  the  "Envelope"  tab,  only  the  required  thickness  of  the  exterior  wall  insulation   was  input,  since  the  other  wall  components  were  accounted  for  in  the  interior  wall   assembly.      Wall  Material  Take-offs   Wall  material  take-offs  were  used  to  generate  inputs  to  model  each  wall  assembly   iteration.  Wall  assembly  insulation  iterations  0  and  1  represent  un-insulated  (air- filled)  and  insulated  139  mm  (2"x6")  interior  structural  stud  cavities.  Iteration  2   represents  a  double  stud  wall  system,  where  a  stud  insulation  cavity  wall  is  added  to   the  exterior  of  the  first  wall  with  a  thickness  of  89  mm.  Iteration  3  represents  an   increased  exterior  stud  insulation  cavity  of  139  mm  deep.  The  thickness  of  wall   insulation  for  iterations  4  through  9  was  determined  by  the  insulation  cavity  space   provided  by  the  exterior  TJI  wall,  which  was  increased  in  thickness  sequentially   from  241  in  iteration  4  to  302,  356,  406,  457,  and  508  mm  for  iterations  5,  6,  7,  8,   and  9,  respectively.  The  total  insulation  depth  is  reported  in  Table  C  -  1.

   Calculations  for  Additional  Wall  Inputs   Interior  Stud  Walls   For  all  cases,  the  interior  structural  stud  walls  remained  the  same.  For  the  interior   stud  walls,  the  following  calculation  was  used  to  determine  the  total  amount  of   wood  used  in  the  structure.  Under  the  "Custom  Wall"  tab,  the  "Length  (m)"   represents  the  total  length  of  the  walls  if  they  were  stretched  out  on  a  single  story.   Two  times  the  perimeter  length  of  the  slab  was  used  for  this  value.  This  takes  into   account  the  additional  wood  used  for  the  top  and  bottom  plates  of  the  wall.  The   "Height  (m)"  represented  the  single-story  height  of  the  wall.   Therefore:   Length  (m)  =  2  x  Perimeter     Height  (m)  =  Single  Story  Height      Exterior  Double-stud  Insulation  Cavities   For  the  exterior  walls,  iterations  2  and  3  are  a  double  stud  configuration,  with  the   studs  running  the  full  two-storey  height.       Therefore:   Length  (m)  =  Perimeter     Height  (m)  =  2  x  Single  Story  Height     

141     

   Exterior  TJI  Insulation  Cavities   TJI  walls  are  not  standard  in  Athena  IE,  therefore  necessitating  input  of  TJI  wall   features  using  a  combination  of  "Wood  Stud"  Assembly  Components  and  the  "Extra   Basic  Material"  function.  Material  take-offs  for  the  TJI  walls  are  conducted  as   follows:      TJI  Model  Part  1  -  Using  Available  Assembly  Components  from  "Custom  Wall"   tool   All  TJI  sizes  modelled  use  the  same  flange  sizes  (89mm  x  38mm).  Additionally,  the   "Custom  Wall"  tool  is  able  to  model  this  size  of  lumber  as  a  "Wood  Stud"  component.   Therefore,  two  additional  "Custom  Wall"  assemblies  will  be  added  to  model  the   interior  and  exterior  facing  TJI  flanges.      TJI  Model  Part  2  -  Using  Extra  Basic  Material  tool   The  "Extra  Basic  Material"  tool  is  used  to  account  for  the  material  usage  of  the   following  components:   The  exterior  plywood  sheathing     The  OSB  used  for  webs  of  the  TJIs   Insulation  in  TJI  cavity  wall   The  exterior  SBPO/air  barrier     The  exterior  cladding  (pine  wood  shiplap  siding)   The  take-offs  for  these  aforementioned  materials  are  determined  in  the  following   sections.      Extra  Basic  Material  #1  Â­  Exterior  Plywood  Sheathing   TJI  Wall  Top  and  Bottom  Plates  and  Exterior  Wall  Sheathing  were  constructed  of   plywood.  Athena  accepts  input  of  plywood  using  the  area  of  plywood,  assuming  that   each  sheet  is  9  mm  thick.  Athena  also  assumes  a  standard  material  wastage  for  off- cuts  of  5%.  The  total  area  of  plywood  used  for  the  top  and  bottom  plates  was   calculated  using  Equations  C  Â­  1  and  C  Â­  2.  Inputs  for  Athena  IE,  along  with   intermediate  calculation  results  are  summarized  in  Table  C  Â­  5.

   Finally,  since  the  reference  building  specification  lists  15  mm  plywood  and  only   9mm  thick  plywood  was  found  in  the  Athena  IE  database,  a  thickness  correction  had   to  be  applied  to  model  the  correct  quantity  of  plywood.      ATotal  9mm  Plywood  =  ATotal  Plywood  x  (15  mm/9  mm)      Where:   ATotal  9mm  Plywood  =  total  area  of  plywood  equivalent  to  15  mm,  m2

      Extra  Basic  Material  #2  Â­  TJI  Web  (OSB)   Athena  accepts  input  of  OSB  using  the  area  of  OSB,  assuming  that  each  sheet  is  9  mm   thick.  Athena  also  assumes  a  standard  material  wastage  for  off-cuts  of  5%.  TJI   properties  were  obtained  from  Weyerhaeuser  (2014)  and  are  summarized  in  Table   C  -  6.  Final  inputs  for  each  assembly  iteration  along  with  the  intermediate   calculation  results  are  summarized  in  Table  C  -  7.

   Exterior  Vertical  Strapping  for  Cladding   Exterior  vertical  strapping  forms  the  ventilation  cavity  and  the  support  structure  for   the  cladding.  This  layer  can  be  modelled  in  Athena  IE  by  using  one  of  the  "Available   Assembly  Components"  of  the  "Custom  Wall"  tool.  A  wood  stud  assembly  is  added   and  the  following  attributes  of  the  vertical  strapping  are  added:   Wall  Type  =  Non  Load  Bearing   Stud  Type  =  Kiln-dried   Sheathing  Type  =  None   Stud  Thickness  =  38  x  64  mm   Stud  Spacing  =  600  o.c.      Since  the  thickness  of  the  wall  changes  as  the  exterior  wall  cavity  space  is  increased   (Cases  2  through  9),  the  length  of  the  wall  upon  which  the  strapping  is  fastened  is   also  increased.  The  height  of  the  exterior  surface  of  the  wall  does  not  change;   therefore  the  value  entered  for  height  is  kept  the  same  for  all  cases.      For  Cases  0  and  1:   The  structural  stud  wall  rests  on  the  slab  and  is  assumed  to  be  flush  with  the  edge.   The  vertical  strapping  is  fastened  to  the  exterior  plywood  sheathing.  Therefore  the   length  of  the  wall  upon  which  the  vertical  strapping  is  applied  is  equal  to  the   perimeter  length  of  the  slab.   Length  (m)  =  Perimeter      For  Cases  2  through  9:   The  exterior  sheathing  layer  is  attached  to  a  secondary  (exterior)  wall  made  up  of   either  studs  or  TJIs.  Therefore  the  length  of  the  wall  upon  which  the  vertical   strapping  is  applied  is  calculated  using  Equation  C  Â­  16.  Calculation  results  for  input   into  Athena  IE  are  summarized  in  Table  C  -  11.      L  =  (9.13  +  dstud  cavity)  x  4      150                                (C  Â­  16)    

   Where:   L  =  wall  length  of  vertical  strapping  contact,  m   dstud  cavity  =  stud  cavity  thickness,  m

   Extra  Basic  Material  #5  -  Exterior  Cladding  -  Pine  Wood  Shiplap  Cladding   The  pine  wood  shiplap  cladding  is  calculated  as  follows.  Athena  IE  accepts  input  of   "Exterior  Cladding"  in  terms  of  surface  area  of  the  material  (m2).  Athena  IE  adds  a   default  of  10%  as  a  construction  waste  factor  for  siding.  Since  the  exterior  cladding   is  applied  directly  to  the  vertical  strapping,  the  surface  area  of  the  exterior  cladding   material  can  be  determined  based  on  the  exterior  wall  perimeter  and  height  using   Equation  C  Â­  17.  Calculation  results  are  summarized  in  Table  C  -  12.        Acladding  =  Hwall  *  (9.13  +  dstud  cavity)  x  4      Where:   Acladding  =  surface  area  of  exterior  cladding,  m2                            (C  Â­  17)

Attic  (Roof)  Assembly  Model  
The  following  general  inputs  were  used  for  all  iterations  when  setting  up  the  roof   assembly  model:   1. Span  (m)  =  4.56  Â­  determined  by  dividing  the  length  of  the  wall  by  2  to  get   the  span  of  the  roof  joists  (9.13  m/2  =  4.56  m).  The  roof  span  entry  for   Athena  determines  the  joist  size  needed.     2. Roof  Width  (m)  =  18.28  m  Â­  obtained  by  dividing  the  footprint  area  of  the   building  by  the  span.     3. Live  Load  =  2.4  kPa  for  Iteration  1  and  3.6  kPa  for  all  other  iterations  Â­  This  is   based  on  Athena's  assumptions  that  solid  wood  38  x  89  mm  joists  spaced  at   400  mm  O.C.  are  used  for  a  live  load  of  2.4  kPa,  while  38  x  140  mm  joists   spaced  at  400  mm  O.C.  are  used  for  a  live  load  of  3.6  kPa.  The  former  scenario   represents  the  typical  roof  load  for  residential  applications,  while  the  latter   scenario  was  selected  to  match  the  design  of  the  reference  building  and   support  the  additional  load  of  the  insulation.   4. Decking  Type  =  Plywood   5. Decking  Thickness  =  15  mm      152     

   Roof  Assembly  Iterations   Roof  insulation  thickness  was  first  varied  by  changing  the  service  cavity  joist  size   from  38  mm  x  89  mm  (2"x4")  in  iterations  0  and  1,  to  38  mm  x  140  mm  (2"x6")  in   iteration  2.  After  the  service  cavity  insulation  was  varied,  additional  insulation  was   added  on  top  of  a  plywood  air  barrier  layer  in  100  mm  (4  inch)  increments  for   iterations  3  through  10.  Iteration  0  consisted  of  an  empty  38  mm  x  89  mm  (2"x4")   service  cavity,  while  the  cavity  was  filled  with  insulation  for  iteration  1.  The  service   cavity  was  increased  to  140  mm  (2"x6")  for  iteration  2.  Additional  insulation   beyond  iteration  2  was  added  on  top  of  the  service  cavity.  All  iteration  insulation   depths  are  summarized  in  Table  C  -  13.

   Roof  Extra  Basic  Material  #1  Â­  Air  Control  Layer   In  order  to  include  the  plywood  air  barrier  as  specified  in  the  reference  building   design,  an  extra  basic  material  had  to  be  defined.  Athena  accepts  input  of  plywood   using  the  area  of  plywood,  assuming  that  each  sheet  is  9  mm  thick.  Athena  also   assumes  a  standard  material  wastage  for  off-cuts  of  5%.  The  total  area  of  plywood   used  for  the  top  and  bottom  plates  is  calculated  as  follows:      Aplywood  =  Abuilding  footprint  =  L  x  W        Where:   L  =  building  length,  m   W  =  building  width,  m   Aplywood  =  total  area  of  plywood  air  control  layer,  m2      Since  only  9  mm  thick  plywood  was  available  in  the  material  database  the  following   conversion  was  done  to  correct  the  quantity  of  plywood  to  reflect  the  reference   building  specified  15  mm  thick  plywood.  The  conversion  was  conducted  according   to  Equation  C  Â­  5,  previously  defined  for  wall  assembly  calculations.                               (C  Â­  18)  

Slab  Assembly  Model  
The  following  general  data  was  input  to  create  the  reference  building  slab  assembly   model.   1. A  "Foundations"  type  assembly  was  added  to  the  main  project   2. "User  Defined  Concrete  Mix  Design  Library"  Â­  "Add"  record  for  "Components"   a. ProcessÂ­  Added  "Ready  Mix  Concrete  Plant  Process"  from  library.  This   process  has  a  "Unit  Quantity  Contribution"  of  1.0  for  each  unit  of   material   b. Material  Â­  Added  "Concrete  30  MPa  (flyash  25%)"  from  library.  Used   since  CMHC  (2000)  lists  using  a  minimum  of  25  MPa  concrete  for  slab   on  grade  construction,  with  30  MPa  being  recommended.
