INTRODUCTION W hile not designated by the United Nations, as many falsely believe, as the world's most multicultural city, Toronto in the early years of the 21 st century is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world. Much of this diversity has resulted from post-W orld W ar II migration to the city from all parts of the globe. Over the years, and especially during the last two decades, numerous studies have been produced in which various aspects of immigration and settlement in the Toronto area have been examined. This Bibliography, an update of earlier versions published by CERIS in 1999 and 2003, provides a listing of books, monographs, research reports, graduate theses, book chapters, and journal articles that deal with immigration and settlement in the Toronto area. U ndergraduate theses are not included here. Access to some relatively obscure publications has never been easier, thanks to postings on the internet. Attention is directed to two websites in particular: www.settlement.org, which is home to a variety of community/agency-developed reports, and the `Search' function found at http://ceris.metropolis.net, which provides digital access to CERIS W orking Papers, the CERIS Policy Matters series, some theses, and a variety of other research reports and documents. Items available from these sites are so indicated within square brackets at the end of a citation. Moreover, readers are also directed to the Housing New Canadians website, which is located at http://www.library.utoronto.ca/hnc/biblio.htm. Two selected bibliographies, on Housing and Immigrants and Housing-Related Discrimination in Canada, can be found at this site. Items in this Bibliography cover the entire history of Toronto and include all "ethnic" and racial groups, including such institutions as the Orange Order. For ease of use, the listings have been divided into three broad categories. The first of these contains a variety of topics under the heading of Studies on Immigration and Settlement in the Toronto Area, while the second is subdivided on the basis of Studies of Particular Groups or Communities. In this edition of the Bibliography, all of the entries in this latter grouping also have been included under the appropriate category or categories in the first section. Several new subheadings have been added to each of these major groupings for this version of the Bibliography. A final division contains more than 150 works of fiction set in Toronto immigrant communities, with almost two dozen new entries in this edition. The original 1999 version of this Bibliography contained 554 entries. The second edition was about 70 per cent longer, with 946 entries, and this edition contains a substantially larger collection of works on immigration and settlement in the Toronto area with 3,428 entries (2,098 in part A, 1,169 in part B, and 161 in part C). Part of this increase is due to the duplication of the entries for the various groups and communities under the appropriate headings in the first section of the Bibliography. Another major component in this growth came from the decision to include articles and book chapters in this edition, which, alone, added more than 500 entries. Moreover, in the half-decade since the last edition, much more has been published about immigration and settlement in the Toronto region. The period since the release of the second edition has seen the publication of a number of important analytical studies of the condition of immigrants in Toronto, and these have been included in the listings. New publications in the CERIS W orking Paper Series also have been added to the Bibliography, as have the publications in the CERIS Policy Matters series and the reports on CERIS-funded research projects, provided they have been "published" on the CERIS website. 1 This edition also contains many more reports published by community-based groups serving immigrants and refugees in the Toronto area. Moreover, access to a digital version of the Dissertations Abstracts database has permitted a much more thorough identification of graduate theses, at the masters and doctoral levels, which have focused on themes associated with immigration

For the sake of completeness, all of these CERIS publications have been included in the Bibliography, even those that do not pertain to the Toronto region. The latter can be found in the Miscellaneous General W orks portion of the first section of the Bibliography.

and settlement in the Greater Toronto Area.2 In addition, the Major Research Papers (MRPs) produced by students in Ryerson's Master's program in Immigration and Settlement Studies, which began to appear in 2005, have been included in this edition of the Bibliography.3 In all cases, where a work deals with two or more named ethnic groups or two or more topics in the first section of the Bibliography, it has been listed under each of its appropriate headings. I wish to thank Rebecca Hii who served as my Research Assistant in 2006/07 and began the compilation of the list of articles from scholarly journals. CERIS provided funding for this position through its research grants for Domain Leaders. Because of its length, this version of the Bibliography is being published exclusively to the CERIS website as a pdf document. As such, it is completely searchable through the appropraite software used to access such documents. The Bibliography will be updated periodically, with the revision date indicated on the cover page. Approval for the publication of the third edition of this Bibliography was given, in my absence, by a unanimous vote at the 8 February 2008 meeting of the CERIS Governance Board. I, of course, take full responsibility for any errors, omissions, and mis-classifications in this publication. I welcome notification concerning any errors and omissions which will be incorporated in the periodic updates to this Bibliography.

Access to this database is available through most university libraries. In many cases, pdf versions of the theses can be downloaded from the database. Most of the MRPs are available in the Ryerson Library. Information on availability can be found at: http://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/programs/immigration/documents/ISS_MRPTopics_Completed.pdf. All of the MRPs have been included here, even those that do not deal with the Toronto region. The latter can be found in the Miscellaneous General W orks portion of the first section of the Bibliography.
