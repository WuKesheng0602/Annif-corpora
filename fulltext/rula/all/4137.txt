INVESTIGATION ON MEMBRANE FOULING IN ULTRAFILTRATION OF LATEX SOLUTION Amira Abdelrasoul Doctor of Philosophy, Chemical Engineering, Ryerson University Toronto, Canada, 2015 ABSTRACT The low-pressure membrane applications are considered to be the most effective and sustainable methods of addressing environmental problems in treating water and wastewater that meets or exceed stringent environmental standards. Nevertheless, membrane fouling is one of the primary operational concerns that is currently hindering a more widespread application of ultrafiltration (UF) with a variety of contaminants. Membrane fouling leads to higher operating costs, higher energy demand, reduced membrane life time, and increased cleaning frequency. As a consequence, an efficient and well-planned UF process is becoming a necessity for consistent and long-term monetary returns. Examining the source and mechanisms of foulant attachment to the membrane's surface is critical when it comes to the research of membrane fouling and its potential practical implementation. A mathematical model was developed in this study in order to predict the amount of fouling based on an analysis of particle attachments. This model was developed using both homogeneous and heterogeneous membranes, with a uniform and nonuniform pore sizes for the UF of simulated latex effluent with a wide range of particle size distribution. The objective of this mathematical model was to effectively identify and address the common shortcomings of previous fouling models, and to account for the existing chemical attachments in membrane fouling. The mathematical model resulting from this study was capable of accurately predicting the mass of fouling retained by the membrane and the increase in transmembrane pressure (TMP). In addition, predictive models of fouling attachments were derived and now form an extensive set of mathematical models necessary for the prediction of membrane fouling at a given operating condition, as well as, the various membrane surface charges. Polycarbonate and Polysulfone flat membranes, with pore sizes of 0.05 µm and a molecular weight cut off of 60,000 respectively, were used in the experimental designs under a constant feed flow rate and a cross-flow mode in UF of the simulated latex paint effluent. The TMP iii

estimated from the model agreed with the experimentally measured values at different operating conditions, mostly within 5.0 - 8.0 % error, and up to 13.0% error for the uniform, and nonuniform pore size membranes, respectively. Furthermore, different types of membranes with a variety of molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) values were tested so as to evaluate the accuracy of the models for a generalized application. In addition , a power consumption model, incorporating fouling attachment as well as chemical and physical factors in membrane fouling, was developed in order to ensure accurate prediction and scale-up. Innovative remediation techniques were likewise developed and applied in order to minimize membrane fouling, enhance the membrane performance, and save energy. Fouling remediation methodologies included the pre-treating of the latex effluent, so as to limit its fouling propensity by using different types of surfactants as cationic and anionic, in addition to the pH change. The antifouling properties of the membranes were improved through the implementation of the membrane pH treatment and anionic surfactant treatment. Increasing the ionic strength of latex effluent or enhancing the membrane surface hydrophilicity facilitated a significant increase in the cumulative permeate flux, a substantial decrease in the total mass of fouling, and a noticeable decrease in the specific power consumption.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Ultrafiltration (UF) for wastewater treatment can no longer be considered an emerging technology. It has been implemented in both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities. In fact, the use of low-pressure membrane systems has experienced an exponential growth over the past few years due to their ability to deliver drinking water and treated wastewater that meet or exceed stringent quality standards. During the manufacturing of paint products, the cleaning of reactors and mixing basins generates a large amount of wastewater. Paint effluents typically have high levels of biological oxygen demand (i.e., BOD of greater than 580 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (COD, greater than 5500 mg/L), and a high level of suspended solids and turbidity (Dey et al., 2004). One of the benefits of treating water-based paint effluent by UF over other processes, such as the electrochemical oxidation (Körbahti and Akta, 2007) or Fenton oxidation (Kurt et al., 2006), is the potential to reclaim the retained solids in the paint effluent for recycling purposes and to reuse the permeate liquid as process or cleaning water (Dey et al., 2004). However, one of the major factors hindering a more widespread application of UF is the permeate flux decline with filtration time. This phenomenon is commonly known as membrane fouling, which refers to the blockage of membrane pores through the combination of sieving and adsorption of particulates and compounds into the membrane surface or within the membrane pores during a filtration process (Javacek and Bouchet, 1993; Kennedy, 2008). Fouling leads to the significantly higher operating costs, higher energy demands, reduced membrane lifetime and increased cleaning frequency. For a typical seawater desalination plant, the cost of the membrane unit is approximately 20­25% of the total capital cost. Usually about 10% of the membrane is replaced annually in order to maintain the targeted product quality and production quantity (Al-Amoudi and Lovitt, 2007). Permeate flux and transmembrane pressure (TMP) are the best indicators of membrane fouling. Membrane fouling leads to a significant increase in the hydraulic resistance, manifested as a permeate flux decline or a TMP increase when the process is operated under constant-TMP or constant-flux conditions, respectively. In a system where the permeate flux is maintained by increasing TMP, the energy required to achieve filtration increases, resulting in a higher power consumption. For a plant with a 100 m3/day capacity the energy consumption is more than 10 KWh/m3; however, it can be reduced to 3.5 KWh/m3 if the fouling is controlled (Avlonitis et al., 2003). Various reported research 1

projects on this subject indicate that the implementation of different fouling remediation techniques results in a significant reduction in the power consumption in the filtration process (Al-Amoudi and Lovitt, 2007; Hu and Stuckey, 2006; Winzeler and Belfort, 1993). One of the studies showed that the total energy consumed for 40 minutes filtration was from 86.14 to 107.57 KJ at 3 bars, while the energy consumed in membrane cleaning ranged from 87.08 to 107 kJ for 50-100 minutes at different operational pressures (Bahnasawy and Shenana, 2010). In addition, over a long period of time, membrane operation is not totally reversible by back-washing (Kosvintsev et al., 2004). This results in increased operational costs, and makes UF a less economically feasible solution for some of the industrial applications. All of these factors and their correlation to various economic aspects make membrane fouling research a priority. Some mechanisms involved in membrane fouling have been proposed. However, no theoretical model is yet available that can accurately predict ultrafiltration performance without requiring experimental data for estimating some of the model's parameters. Instead, empirical and semi-empirical models are mostly used (Vela et al., 2008). In addition, effects of the operating parameters are yet to be fully understood. The Hermia model predicts the decline of permeate flux with the ultimate flux of zero, for dead-end filtration (Hermia, 1982). In cross-flow filtration, membrane fouling is strongly affected by the shear flow, hence, the ultimate flux would be finite (non-zero) (Davis, 1992; Song, 1998). Nevertheless, the Hermia model has been successfully applied to cross-flow membrane filtration in a number of research studies (Hwang et al., 2007; Salahi et al., 2010). In addition, the effects of operating parameters on membrane fouling vary significantly among different systems. Other models developed and reported are thus also empirical and semi-empirical. Among those, the more popular ones are the resistance-in-series model and the concentration polarization model (Viadero et al., 1999; Bruijn et al., 2005; Ho and Zydney, 2002). These models are system-specific, and are thus their uses are limited when it comes to process generalization and scale-up. One-dimensional and two-dimensional models for the permeate flux in a tubular membrane, derived from equations of continuity and motion were also reported in scientific literature (Paris et al., 2002; Song, 1998). Consequently, in most cases empirical and semi-empirical models are used in the UF design. In addition, mono-dispersed suspensions (solutions with single-size particles) were implemented in many research studies. Arguably, this imposes a practical limitation on the extent to which the research results can be applied to the real-life cases involving wastewaters, and specifically, wastewaters where the suspended solids have a wide range of particle size distribution. 2

The key question underlying membrane fouling and its practical applicability in ultrafiltration is the cause of foulant attachment to the membrane's surface. The two major forces contributing to the foulant attachment are the dispersion interaction force and the polar interaction force (Israelachvili, 1992). Foulants that remain attached to the membrane surfaces are most likely caused by the balance of the van der Waals attraction force, and the electrostatic repulsion force between particles and the membrane's surface due to the surface charges. Van Oss proposed the concepts of apolar and polar interactions in order to classify and effectively predict the interactions in an aqueous medium, based on the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) theory (Gregory, 2005). The strength of chemical attachment depends on the dispersion interaction (apolar), as well as, predominantly, on the polar interaction. The latter can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the hydrophilicity of the two interacting surfaces (Gregory, 2005; Israelachvili, 1992). These interactions elucidate the advantages of altering the particle-to-membrane or particle-toparticle attachments by manipulating the zeta potential of the membrane surface or the ionic strength of the solution, as an effective fouling remediation technique and allow for a lower membrane fouling propensity. Owing to this, the primary objectives of the present study were to:   Investigate the mechanism of membrane fouling in ultrafiltration of latex paint with a wide range of particle size distribution with non-uniform pore size membranes. Develop, simulate, and validate a novel mechanistic mathematical model capable of offering an accurate estimation of the mass of fouling and the increase in the

transmembrane pressure, applicable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous membranes with uniform and non-uniform pore size membranes, respectively.  Obtain predictive models that would allow for accurate estimation of the fouling attachments, at a given operating condition, as well as, at a specific surface charge of the membrane surface.  Investigate the various effects of the operating conditions and membrane surface zeta potential on fouling attachments, total mass of fouling, cake height, cumulative permeate flux, and specific power consumption in ultrafiltration of latex solution.  Develop a set of innovative membrane fouling remediation techniques capable of enhancing the ultrafiltration performance and reducing power consumption.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1. Membrane filtration Membrane filtration is a process that separates solid constituents of a solution, and is based on the correlation between the sizes of the solid particles to the pore size of the membranes, as illustrated in Table 2.1 (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003).

Table 2.1: Comparison of different types of membranes (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003)

There are two main modes of membrane filtration, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The first one is dead-end mode, where the feed is directed perpendicularly to the membrane's surface allowing for the separation of particles larger than the membrane pore size from the permeate stream. In this case, building up of the solid cake layer requires an increase in pressure on the feed side so as to achieve the desired permeate flow rate. The second mode is cross flow, where the feed flows parallel to the membrane's surface. In this mode, separation across the membrane occurs due to the pressure driving force, causing the clean solvent to pass through the membrane as a permeate stream; and hence, the retentate concentration increases. It was reported by Teuler and Glucina that the energy consumption of a cross-flow system is about 5 kW.h/m3 permeate. Alternatively at the same operating conditions, for a dead-end filtration the energy consumption is only 0.1 to 0.2 kW.h/m3 permeates (Teuler and Glucina, 2003)

Figure 2.1: Illustration of Dead-End and Cross-flow modes of Ultrafiltration (Li et al., 2008) Membranes are manufactured from either polymeric or ceramic materials. Polymeric membranes can be divided into two classes, namely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophilic polymers, such as: cellulose and its derivatives, Polysulfone (PS), polyethersulfone (PES), and polycarbonates (PC), have been used widely for the manufacturing UF membranes. Hydrophilic membranes tend to have less fouling than hydrophobic ones. For the fabrication of ceramic membranes, alumina, zirconia, titania, and glass are widely used. They are also known as inorganic membranes. Inorganic membranes remain remarkably stable at high temperature (over 100 °C) and at extreme pH, but they are brittle (Li et al., 2008). There are many configurations of membrane modules: tubular hollow fiber, plate and frame, spiral wound and rod (Russell, 2006). The most common one is tubular or flat sheet module. According to the American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF) survey in 2002, the capital cost for low pressure membrane system is in the range of $ 0.18-$ 0.23/ gallon per day (gpd) and is expected to become even lower in the coming decades with values closer to $ 0.15- $ 0.20/gpd (Lozier and Jacangelo, 2002; Mohanty and Purkait, 2012). Membrane systems are operated under either constant flow rate with variable pressure or constant transmembrane pressure. To maintain a constant permeate flux for a membrane undergoing fouling an increase in transmembrane pressure is necessary. In constant-pressure systems, the permeate flux decreases with filtration time due to membrane fouling. In industrial applications, membrane process is usually operated under a constant permeate flow rate mode since most industrial processes are continuous. However, this can be very difficult to achieve and maintain for prolonged periods of time because of membrane fouling.

2.2. Membrane fouling Fouling refers to the build-up of solid compounds on the membrane's surface or within its pores, which leads to the reduction in the permeate flux at constant pressure. The rate of membrane fouling depends on the membrane module configuration, the mode of operation, the membrane material, operational conditions and the feed composition.

2.2.1. Membrane fouling mechanism A typical flux-time curve of ultrafiltration (UF) , as shown in Figure 2.2, starts with (I) a rapid initial drop of the permeate flux, (II) followed by a longer period of gradual flux decrease, and (III) ended with a steady-state flux.

Figure 2.2: A Schematic presentation of the three stages in flux decline (Li et al., 2008) Flux decline in membrane filtration is a result of the increase in the membrane resistance by the membrane pore blockage and the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface. The pore blocking increases the membrane resistance while the cake formation creates an additional layer of resistance to the permeate flow. Pore blocking and cake formation can be considered as two essential mechanisms of the membrane fouling. The rapid initial drop of the permeate flux can be attributed to quick blocking of membrane pores. The maximal permeate flux always occurs at the beginning of filtration because membrane pores are clean and widely open at that moment. Flux declines as membrane pores are being blocked by retained particles. The degree of pore blockage depends on the shape and relative size of particles and pores. The blockage is generally more complete when the particles and pores are similar in both shape and size (Belfort and Zydney, 1994; Hermia, 1982; Javacek and Bouchet, 1993). Pore blocking is a quick process compared with cake formation since less than one layer of particles is sufficient to achieve the full blocking (Granger et al., 1985; Javacek and Bouchet, 1993). 6

Further flux decline after pore blockage is due to the formation and growth of a cake layer on the membrane surface. The cake layer is formed on the membrane surface as the amount of retained particles increases. The cake layer creates an additional resistance to the permeate flow and the resistance of the cake layer increases with the growth of cake layer thickness. Consequently, the permeate flux continues decreasing with time.

2.2.2 Concentration polarization and mass transfer theory Concentration polarization is caused by the build-up of inorganic species at the membrane-liquid interface, and resulting in a region of higher concentration if compared to the overall bulk. Concentration polarization leads to the reduction in permeate flux due to the formation of gel layer (Benitez et al., 2009). As illustrated in Figure 2.3, at steady state with a well-established gel layer, the solute mass transfer by the convective flux, Jv, within the laminar boundary layer is balanced by the diffusive flux of the retained solute in the opposite direction, as expressed below:
 

JV  =

where Di is the diffusion coefficient of the macromolecule in the boundary layer,

2.3. Mathematical models for membrane fouling Pursuant to the understanding of different roles of aquatic components in membrane fouling, different mathematical models have been developed to describe the membrane fouling. There are many empirical models found in literature (Mendret et al., 2010; Ahmad et al., 2006; Bhattacharjee and Datta, 2003). However, empirical models usually require extensive pilot and full scale tests in order to obtain the required constants to predict the permeate flux. In most cases these constants also have little physical meanings. These models also offer limited insight into the mechanism of fouling. Among those, the more popular one is the resistance-in-series model. The permeate flux J, [m3/m2.s] is expressed as below:  =
P µ ( + )

Equation (2.3)

where P [Pa] is transmembrane pressure,  [Pa.s] is the solution viscosity and Rm [m-1] is the hydrodynamic resistance of clean membrane. The hydrodynamic resistance of cake layer Rc [m-1] is defined as: Rc =c. md Equation (2.4) where c [m/kg] is the specific cake resistance of the cake layer on the membrane surface and md [kg/m2] is the mass of deposit per unit surface area of membrane (Chellam et al., 1998; Kim and Hoek, 2002; Zhang and Song, 2000). However, the model does not explain the mechanisms of fouling, but only indicates the proportionality between the increase in hydrodynamic resistance and the mass of deposit on the membrane as filtration proceeds. The values of c vary from 1010 to 1016 m/kg for different aquatic substances (Endo and Alonso, 2001). The resistance-in-series model has been used frequently to analyze membrane fouling phenomenon. Although it is easy to apply, one should be cautious in the use of this model as it doesn't consider pore blocking mechanism (Song and Elimelech, 1995; Viadero et al., 1999). Kosvintsev et al. developed a model to describe membrane fouling by physical sieving of particles larger than membrane pore sizes (Kosvintsev et al., 2002). According to their analysis, membrane fouling by cake filtration does not start right after the onset of filtration, and the fouling is rather dominated by pore blocking until the membrane surface is covered by particles. This model describes the permeate volume as a function of permeate time, dominated by pore blocking at constant pressure as follows:
1 

V=

ln (1 +  t*)

Equation (2.5)

8

where V is the permeate volume [cm3],  it is the ratio of the membrane area fouled with particles to the area of clean pores. n represents the number of particles per unit volume of the feed,  is the ratio of the pores area to the total membrane area and t* is the dimensionless filtration time =  n 0
  

 . More details of the model are presented in the authors' recent

work (Bruijn et al., 2005; Kosvintsev et al., 2004). This model was limited to pore blocking fouling and the effect of cake layer on the permeate volume was not considered. Zydney et al. combined two fouling mechanisms, pore blockage and cake formation, to describe fouling of low pressure membranes by proteins and humic acids (Ho and Zydney, 2002 ; Srebnik, 2003; Yuan et al., 2002). Again, this model is established by assuming that the fouling is caused primarily by large particles, aggregates of proteins and humic acids. The mathematical development is based on constant pressure operation and varying flux, and it can be written as below:
J Jo Kb P Cb µ   Kb P Cb µ 

= exp (-

t) + 

 +

[1 - exp (-

t)]

Equation (2.6)

where J and J0 [m3/s] are the permeate flux at a given time and the initial flux through the unfouled membrane respectively, Kb [m2/kg], a pore blockage parameter, which is equal to the blocked membrane area per unit mass of aggregates convected to the membrane. This parameter can be evaluated experimentally. Cb [kg/m3] is the bulk concentration of large aggregates, Rm [1/m] is the clean membrane resistance, Rc is cake layer resistance [1/m],  is the solution viscosity and P is the transmembrane pressure [Pa]. Both resistances can be evaluated experimentally. The right-hand side of the equation has two terms that are related to pore blocking and cake formation, respectively. The first term (pore blocking) dominates the early stage of fouling, and the second term (cake filtration) governs fouling at longer times. The impact of solution chemistry on membrane fouling and the chemical attachment between paticles, however, not included in the model. In comparison to the aforementioned models, adsorptive fouling of membranes by particles smaller than membrane pore sizes is incorporated in the following model. The impact of the adsorption layer on the permeability of membranes can be estimated using a modified form of Hagen-Poiseulle capillary filtration model (Srebnik, 2003) from Equation 2.7.
    

= [ 1-

]4

Equation (2.7)

9

where J and J0 (m3/m2. s) are the permeate flux after the formation of the adsorptive fouling layer and the initial flux, respectively. Under a given transmembrane pressure,  ' (m) is the thickness of the adsorption layer that can be measured experimentally and rp (m) is the membrane pore radius. The major difficulty in applying the adsorptive fouling model to filtration of natural surface waters lies in the complex nature of aquatic Natural organic matters (NOM). In other words, the value of ' is not easy to obtain either theoretically or experimentally. This problem is further complicated by the heterogeneity of membrane surface properties. Hermia developed four empirical models for four basic types of fouling: complete blocking, intermediate blocking, standard blocking, and cake layer formation (Hermia, 1982). Each mode of fouling depends on the size of particles and whether they are either larger or smaller than the membrane pore size. In the complete blocking mode, the particles larger than the pore size are adsorbed onto the membrane's surface. In intermediate blocking, the particles of similar size to that of the pore cause an obstruction of the pores. Typically, it is assumed that the particles are chemically adsorbed into the surface, and the new particles arriving to the membrane are blocked by the already adsorbed particles. Standard blocking involves adsorption of small particles (smaller than the pore size) into the membrane pore walls, resulting in some restriction for the permeate flow going through the pores. The final mode of fouling is the formation of a cake layer due to a build-up of particles on the membrane's surface. Particles involved in the formation of the cake layer may be larger or smaller than the membrane pore size (Bowen et al., 1995; Hwang and Lin, 2002). Schematic diagrams of the four fouling modes are presented in Figure 2.4.

The basic expression for Hermia for constant flux is:
 
 

= k 

Equation (2.8)

´ where P is the increase in TMP,  is the mass of particles that attach to the membrane

surface, k and n are constants depending on the type of fouling. k equals to

 

and

2  

for

cake formation and standard pore blocking, respectively, while k is simply equal to the projected area of a particle on the membrane surface () for both intermediate and complete blocking models. c and Rm are the specific cake resistance [m/kg] and the membrane resistance [1/m], respectively. Lm is the length of cylindrical membrane pore and  is the particles density. Values for n are 0, 1, 3/2 and 2 for cake formation, intermediate blocking, standard blocking and complete blocking, respectively. Overall, the Hermia model does not adequately consider all of the chemical aspects involved in fouling, however it does provide a useful preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of different types of particle attachments on fouling once it occurs (Appendix A).

2.4. Chemical attachment of foulants on membrane surfaces The major forces contributing to the attachments are dispersion interaction force and polar interaction force (Israelachvili, 1992). Foulants staying together on membrane surfaces are most likely due to the balance of the van der Waals attractive force and the electrostatic repulsion between particles and the membrane surface due to the surface charges. To represent the dispersion interaction, the Hamaker constant can be used. It is an indicator of the strength of van der Waals interactions forces between macroscopic bodies through a third medium, as presented in Figure 2.5.Typical values of the Hamaker constant are in the range of 10-19 - 10-21 J. It can be estimated using the Lifshitz theory of macroscopic van der Waals interaction forces (Israelachvili, 1992). Van Oss postulated the concepts of apolar and polar interactions to classify and predict the interactions in an aqueous medium, based on the DLVO theory (Israelachvili, 1992; Gregory, 2005) . The apolar interaction is mainly dispersion interaction. On the other hand, the polar interaction is the interaction between Lewis acid-base pairs in the system, including the two interacting entities and surrounding water molecules. These interactions are useful in explaining the advantage of hydrophilizing the membrane surface to reduce the irreversible attachment of particles and other fouling materials on membrane surface (Carroll et al., 2002; Hester and Mayes, 2002; Liu et al., 2003; Taniguchi, 2003; Wavhal and Fisher, 2003; Yu et al., 2005). The 11

strength of chemical attachment depends not only on the dispersion interaction (apolar), but also, or even more predominantly, on the polar interactions. The latter can be either attractive or repulsive dependent on the hydrophilicity of the two interacting surfaces. All aforementioned chemical attachment mechanisms are based on the assumption that the interacting surfaces have homogeneous surface properties, and thus can be characterized using some global parameters, such as: charge density, hydrophobicity, and the Hamaker constant. However, this may not be realistic because particles could have heterogeneous surfaces. Different parts of the surface have different affinities to the membrane.

Figure 2.5: Interaction between 2 microscopic bodies 1 and 2 through medium (Israelachvili, 1992) 2.5. Factors affecting fouling There are a number of key factors affecting fouling. The membrane properties play a critical role in membrane fouling, especially, properties such as pore size, hydrophobicity, pore size distribution, and membrane material. The solution properties are likewise essential in determining how fouling formation occurs. Some of the aspects that can affect fouling and relate to the solution are pH, solid concentration, particle size, and physical and chemical characteristics of particles. Finally, the operating conditions, such as, temperature, flow rate, and pressure, are all contributing factors to fouling formation.

2.5.1. Membrane Properties In an aqueous environment a membrane can be attractive or repulsive to water. The composition of the membrane and its corresponding surface chemistry determine its interaction with water, thus affecting its wettability. The wettability of the membrane can be determined by measuring the contact angle between the membrane surface and a droplet of water, as shown in Figure 2.6. Hydrophilic membranes are characterized by the presence of 12

active groups that have the ability to form hydrogen-bonds with water and so water droplets spread out on the membrane surface as can be seen in Figure (2.6.a). Hydrophobic membranes have the opposite interaction to water compared to hydrophilic membranes as they have little or no tendency to absorb water and water tends to bead on their surfaces (i.e. discrete droplets) as shown in Figure (2.6.b). Hydrophobic membranes possess low wettability due to the lack of active groups in their surface for the formation of hydrogenbonds with water. This tends to enhance fouling. Usually, greater charge density on a membrane surface is associated with greater membrane hydrophilicity. Hydrophilic membranes are thus often used for water treatment and wastewater recovery to reduce fouling.

(a) (b) Figure 2.6: (a) Hydrophilic membrane, (b) Hydrophobic membrane (Al-Amoudi and Lovitt, 2007) Membrane morphology also has a considerable effect on fouling as pore size, pore size distribution and pore geometry, especially at the surface of the membrane. These determine the predominant fouling mechanisms such as pore blocking and cake formation as previously discussed in Section 2.2.1. 2.5.2. Solution Properties The properties of the feed solution also significantly influence membrane fouling. Some of the important feed properties are solid (particle) concentration, particle properties, pH and ionic strength. Generally, an increase in the feed concentration results in a decline in the permeate flux. This is due to the increase in membrane fouling rate. Particles can cause fouling by pore blocking, pore narrowing or cake formation, dependent on the particle sizes. In a filtration process, the particle sizes in the feed often cover a wide range. The presence of fine as well as coarse particles results in a lower cake porosity as the fine particles can slide between the large ones, filling the interstices (Vyas, 2000). The range of the particle size distribution plays a major role in the selective deposition. In addition to the particle size, the particle shape affects the porosity of the cake formed on the membrane surface. In general, the lower the particle sphericity, the greater is the porosity (Vyas, 2000).

13

Some other factors, such as: pH, ionic strength, and electric charges of particles, are also important. The pH and ionic strength of the feed affect the charge on the membrane, the charge on the particles, conformation and stability of the particles, and there by adhesiveness of particles/molecules and the size of the cake. 2.5.3. Operating Conditions The effect of temperature on the permeate flux was investigated and found that at higher temperatures, the permeate flux increased, indicating a lower degree of fouling. Changing the feed temperature from 20°C to 40°C led to an increase in the permeate flux up to 60% (Salahi et al., 2010). The effect of the cross-flow velocity on the permeate flux has been studied for a wide variety of feed solutions. It is believed that increasing the cross -flow velocity positively affects the permeate flux (Salahi et al., 2000). Larger cross-flow velocity leads to a reduction of aggregation of the feed solids in the gel layer, essentially due to increasing diffusion of these components back towards the bulk, leading to an overall reduction in the effect of concentration polarization. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) between the feed side and the permeate stream greatly affects the permeation rate. At a higher TMP, the force of the fluid flowing towards the membrane is increased, leading to a higher permeate flux. As the applied pressure is increased, the resulting higher flux leads to the increase in the concentration polarization at the membrane surface. If the pressure is increased further to a critical pressure, concentration polarization becomes large enough for the accumulation of solutes at the membrane surface to form a gel layer. Once the gel layer has formed, further increase in the applied pressure does not lead to further increase in the permeate flux above this critical value. The gel layer thickness and the density of the retained material at the membrane surface, however, increases. This limits the permeate flux through the membrane. It was reported that no fouling was experimentally observed when the process was operated under this critical flux. 2.6. Remediation of membrane fouling Fouling remediation can be done through the pre-treatment of the feed with surfactants so as to limit its fouling propensity and allow for the micellar-enhanced filtration, change pH of the feed, improvement of antifouling properties of the membrane, and optimization of operating conditions.

14

2.6.1. Micellar-Enhanced filtration Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration is an emerging technique that is used to improve the performance of a filtration process by adding a surfactant to the feed in order to promote the entrapment of foulants in the micelles formed by the surfactant. Surfactants are molecules that contain a hydrophobic tail (usually long chain hydrocarbon) and a hydrophilic head, as shown in Figure (2.7.a). Above a specific concentration surfactant molecules come together to form clusters or micelles as illustrated in figure (2.7.b). This concentration is termed the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and differs depending on the specific surfactant being implemented. Surfactants can be generally categorized by the charge of the hydrophilic portion of the molecule as: anionic (negatively charged), cationic (positively charged), non-anionic (neither positively nor negatively charged), and zwitterionic (both negatively and negatively charged). The formation of micelles increases the particle size, allowing for the use of membranes with larger pore sizes while maintaining the same feed. Some surfactants also interfere with hydrophobic interactions between foulants and membranes (Byhlin and Jonsson, 2002).

(a)

(b)

Figure 2.7: Illustration of (A) Surfactant molecule (b) micelle composed of a number of surfactant molecules. Bedasie et al., 2010, reported that adding cationic surfactants, like Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), resulted in an improved ultrafiltration of the latex paint wastewater, while the permeate flux increased up to 134% (Bedasie et al., 2010). Mikulasek (Mikultiek and Cakl, 1994) reported that addition of 5% wt. /wt. of an anionic surfactant (Disponil AES 60, Henkel, Germany) to a latex solution was the most effective way of enhancing latex ionic strength since a pre-treatment prior to microfiltration resulted in nearly four times higher permeate flux. Influences of surfactants on membrane fouling are mostly governed by the surfactant molecular structure and the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. 15

2.6.2 Effects of change in pH of the feed on membrane fouling The ionic strength of the feed solution significantly alters the membrane surface properties and interactions of colloidal foulants, thus affecting the fouling potential ( Singh and Song, 2005; Binks and Horozov, 2006). For hydrophilic membranes, membrane fouling decreased when the ionic strength of the feed solution was amplified through the increase of the solution pH. This was attributed to the augmentation of the electrostatic repulsion forces between the foulants and the membrane surface, due to the increased negative charge on the membrane surface (Childress and Elimelesh, 1996; Chun et al., 2002; Deshrnukh and Childress, 2001; Elimelech et al., 2010; Faibish et al., 1998; Jones and O'Melia,2000; Mika et al., 2006; Nal and Yonggang, 2012). It was reported that polyacrylic acid was usually very well rejected by an ultrafiltration membrane at pH of 5 and above, but was completely permeable through the same membrane at pH of 3 and lower. This change in rejection behaviour was related to the alteration of the configuration of the polyacid. In a solution at pH of 5 or higher acrylic acid was ionized. In the ionized form, the negatively charged carboxyl groups along with the polymer backbone repelled each other, hence, the polymer coil was extended considerably and made relatively inflexible. In this form, the molecule couldn't readily permeate small pores in an ultrafiltration membrane. At pH of 3 or lower, the carboxyl groups along the poly acrylic acid polymer backbone were all protonated. The resulting neutral molecule was significantly more flexible and could pass through the membrane's pores (Li et al., 2008). Moreover, the pH of the solution affects the membrane surface properties. At low pH, the hydrophilic membrane becomes less negatively charged, resulting in more attraction with the latex. However, at a high pH, the negative charge of the membrane as well as the ionic strength of the latex particles increase, resulting in a higher repulsion force between particles and the membrane surface. Owing to this, the membrane fouling decreases and permeates flux increases (Childress and Elimelesh, 1996).

2.6.3 Membrane properties modification The enhancement of the hydrophilicity of membranes can help reducing membrane fouling (Chang et al., 2008; Gullinkala and Escobar, 2008; Hua et al., 2008). Various techniques can be used to increase the membrane surface hydrophilicity. In comparison to other surface modification techniques, such as: plasma treatment, irradiation with gammarays, corona discharge, ion beam treatment and UV radiation, ozonation is an inexpensive method which allows for simple and relatively effective operation (Wang et al., 2000). 16

Moreover, ozonation offers a uniform surface modification even in cases with complicated shapes (Yuan, Y. Et al., 2002). When polymers are exposed to ozone, active peroxide groups are introduced onto the surface. These active peroxide groups are capable of initiating graft polymerization of vinyl monomers with hydrophilic groups. The hydrophilicity of the polymer surfaces is thus improved (Gatenholm et al., 1997). Ozonation can be conducted in either gaseous phase or aqueous phase. Notably, aqueous ozonation facilitates the rapid decomposition of molecular ozone and the formation of free radicals which are stronger oxidants than ozone itself. Oxidation by molecular ozone is defined as direct oxidation as in a gaseous ozonation while oxidation by radicals formed from the ozone's reaction with water is defined as indirect oxidation (Hoigne and Bader, 1976). It was reported that in surface hydrophilicity modification of polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene membranes, the generation of peroxide increased with ozonation time and applied ozone dose regardless of whether the ozonation was conducted in aqueous phase or in gaseous phase (Gu et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2012). It was determined that for hydrophilicity improvement, aqueous ozonation was noticeably more effective than gaseous ozonation while catalytic ozonation was the most effective one (Gu et al., 2012; Gu et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2012). The above conclusion was supplemented by the results of lower measured contact angles, the surface characterization with new peaks occurring at 1716 cm-1 by FTIR and the increased intensity of the peak with the applied ozone dose. This peak corresponds to aliphatic aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and aliphatic ketones (Patel et al., 2012). Results of filtration tests likewise showed that the protein adsorption on the membrane was reduced more for the aqueous phase ozonated membrane. Moreover, peroxide generation was very stable, featuring a reduction in the peroxide amount after 30 days of only around 3%. pH is an essential parameter in aqueous ozonation because ozone self-decomposition in water depends on the pH. It was found that the concentration of peroxides decreased gradually with an increase in pH (Patel et al., 2012). Hydrophilization of the membrane's surface can also be conducted by pre-coating the membrane with a nonionic surfactant. This method is highly effective and reliable in practical application because of its simple operation. With hydrophilization treatment, the ultrafiltration of antifoam rejection was improved significantly, and hence, the permeate flux was almost doubled (Noble and Stern, 1995). Keesom investigated polycarbonate membrane surface modification by adsorption of ionic surfactants on the membrane surface (Keesom et al., 1988). The authors reported that by adding Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), even at very low concentrations at pH of 7 or higher, the zeta potential of membrane surface is negatively 17

increased up to -25 mV. Increasing the membrane surface charge results in permeates flux being doubled and the flux decline rate with time decreased. 2.7. Economic Aspects The use of membrane systems has experienced an exponential growth over the last 5 years due to their capacity to deliver drinking water and wastewater that meet stringent industry compliance standards. The average annual growth rate of UF is 9.7% from $458 million in 2002 to $727 million in 2007. The global market of UF was raised to more than $3 billion in 2010 (Wang et al., 2011). Lower UF costs are spurred by increased competition, higher demand that regulate the economic policies in manufacturing, and more efficient process operation methods (Mohanty and Purkait, 2012). According to the American Water Works Association Research Foundation AWWARF survey in 2002, the capital cost for low-pressure membrane system is currently in the range of $0.18-$0.23/gallon per day (gpd) and is expected to lower to $0.15-$0.20/gpd in coming decades (Lozier and Jacangelo, 2002; Mohanty and Purkait, 2012). This means that the majority of cost reduction methods incited by the competitive market environment have already been realized in the past few years. Further reduction in cost would largely come from either the development of high flux, low fouling membranes, or the incorporation of more efficient ways to operate both of these factors in membrane systems. The membrane can be considered as the core of a desalination plant where the cost of membrane unit is about 20­25% of the total capital cost (Al-Amoudi and Lovitt, 2007). With the introduction of membrane fouling reducing strategies, significant savings can be achieved with respect to membrane and replacement costs. To compare the costs of a membrane plant with and without fouling control, consider the following case for a 36-Mgd (million gallons of water processed daily) at a wastewater plant in Table (2.2) (Caothien and O'Connell, 2002). This case study analysis was based on a 20-year life cycle of the plant equipment, membrane replacement period of 10 years, and a 6% interest rate. Operating the membranes at enhanced flux capacities resulted in 30% savings of the original projected costs. The raised energy costs for pumping/heating and chemicals (operating cost) were minor in comparison to the savings in membrane capital and replacement costs (Caothien and O'Connell, 2002).

It was also reported that for a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 100 m3/day, the energy consumption is more than 10 KWh/m3 that can be reduced to 3.5 KWh/m3 if fouling is effectively controlled (Avlonitis, 2003; Colic, 2007) These economics of wastewater treatment emphasize the necessity to prioritize membrane fouling research. Economic and innovation potential that exists in membrane research needs to be explored further through the development of novel techniques for the reduction and prevention of membrane fouling, and minimizing the overall operating costs based on chemical consumption, energy consumption, cleaning frequency, and membrane life time.

CHAPTER 3 MODEL DEVELOPMENT
In this study a novel mechanistic model of membrane fouling was developed for homogeneous and heterogeneous membranes. The derivations of the model equations are illustrated in details in Appendix (B). 3.1. Modeling Approach One of the research objectives is to develop a model that is capable of assessing the effect of physiochemical/chemical attachment potentials on ultrafiltration membrane fouling by latex. As indicated in this chapter some appropriate assumptions on physical and chemical properties of ultrafiltration membranes are made in order to establish a simple but useful mathematical model for an in-depth understanding of the fouling phenomenon. 3.2.Model development for uniform pore size membrane Membrane fouling refers to the blockage of membrane pores through the

combination of sieving and adsorption of the particles into the membrane surface or within the membrane pores during the ultrafiltration process, followed by a cake layer formation. Fouling is primarily ascribed to the existence of favorable chemical attachments among foulant entities (coagulation attachment) and between foulants and membrane surfaces (depositional attachment). The attachment probabilities are dependent not only on the properties of the foulants and the membranes, but also on the solution chemistry and the operating conditions. In the present study, a mathematical model was developed to predict the amount of fouling based on analyses of particle attachments in ultrafiltration of a latex paint solution. The mathematical model was combined with Hermia model to further develop models for transmembrane pressure prediction. 3.2.1. Model Assumptions It is assumed that the entire surface of the polycarbonate ultrafiltration membrane has homogeneous chemical properties, and hence, the attachment probability between the membrane and a particle ( pm) is the same everywhere on the membrane. Likewise, it is also assumed that the particle -to-particle attachment probability ( pp) is uniform throughout the filtration system. Also, latex particles are assumed to be nondeformable, spherical particles possessing uniform surface properties. The sizes of latex particles and membrane pores are regarded as the primary factor in determining the occurrence of surface fouling (cake layer formation or pore blocking) and adsorptive internal 20

plugging. The radius of a latex particle (represented as a) could be either greater or smaller than the membrane pore radius ( Dm/2) since the simulated latex paint wastewater has a wide particle size distribution. Therefore, due to the poly-dispersed nature of the latex paint solution, the models were developed for different particle size ranges with respect to the membrane pore diameter. For cross-flow filtration, the collision and attachment of particles to particles and/or particles to membrane occur in the flow boundary layer (Romero and Davis, 1999). Not all collisions result in attachments as indicated by the probability of attachment less than 1. The projected area of a unit mass of the particles on membrane surface,  [m2/kg] is calculated as:
0.75  

=

Equation (3.1)

where  is the particle density [kg/m3]. On the other hand, the structure of UF membranes is simplified as homogenous porous bodies with uniform circular cylindrical pores. The diameter of the pores, Dm [m], is related to the mean pore size of the commercial membrane used in the study as determined in solute rejection tests. The length of membrane pores is Lm [m], the number density of membrane pores is Nm [1/m2]. And the surface porosity of the membrane is s [dimensionless]. The attachment potentials between a latex particle and the ultrafiltration membrane and between two latex particles denoted as pm and pp, respectively are defined as:
               

pm [dimensionless]=

pp [dimensionless]=

               

These two attachment probabilities are the key parameters of the model. It is assumed that the entire surface of the membrane has homogeneous chemical properties and therefore the attachment probability between the membrane and a particle (pm) is the same everywhere inside and outside the membrane pores, including solid surface and pore openings. Likewise, it is also assumed that the attachment probability (pp) is uniform for particles in the feed water or between a particle in the feed stream and a particle attached on the membrane surface.

21

In order to develop a model based on the process of membrane fouling, fouling is considered having three consecutive steps: collision, attachment and reduction of permeability. The developed model was based on the modified Hermia model for a constant flux as illustrated in Appendix (A). The latex particle distribution will be divided by its size to contribute to the fouling modes. 3.2.2. Particles Size Classification 3.2.2.1. Large particles (Particle diameter  pore diameter) (a Dm/2) The reduction of membrane permeability is dominated by pore blockage and the cake layer formation if the fouling is caused by particles larger than the pore size. Apparently from Figure (3.1), particles cannot penetrate into membrane pores as a result of size exclusion. Particle 1 is delivered to a membrane pore by the flow. This particle stays at the pore entrance if the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on the particle by the flow cannot overcome the interaction between the particle and the membrane. The particles gradually cover the surface and reduce the available open pores for incoming particles to attach with. Hence, the incoming particles have less probability to attach to the pores, but more probability to have particle-particle attachment as particle 3 which can be flushed away from the membrane surface by the reversed drag force during hydraulic backwashing of the membrane. Therefore, the fouling caused by this particle is hydraulically reversible. On the other hand, for particle 1 if the chemical attachment of this particle to other particles is less than the chemical attachment of this particle to the membrane surface, the pore blockage will be more predominate and less likely to be hydraulically reversible. In comparison, particle 2 is intercepted by the membrane surface and becomes part of the cake layer as it does not directly reduce the area of the pore entrance beneath. However, it is likely to remain on the membrane surface during hydraulic backwashing if particle-membrane attachment is strong enough to overcome the drag force of the backwash flow. Particle 4 is also attached to the membrane surface as particle 2. However, due to the difference in coagulation affinity, particle 4 becomes an effective collector to capture incoming particles that pass around it. The particle-particle attachment between particle 3 and particle 4 could then occur. Particle 3 then participates in the formation of a cake layer.

22

Figure 3.1: A Diagram of UF membrane fouling by colloidal particles larger than the membrane pore size.

Three types of collisions can happen on membrane outside surfaces: collision between a particle and the membrane solid surface as particles (2, 4), collision between a particle and another particle attached on the membrane solid surface as particle (3), and collision between a particle and the membrane pore as particle (1). Among all three modes of collision namely particle-to-pore, particle-to-surface and particle-to-particle, the collision probabilities are complementary, and hence, the summation of those collision probabilities is equal to unity:

s +p +pp = 1

Equation (3.2)

where s, p, and pp [dimensionless] are the collision probabilities between a particle and the membrane surface, a membrane pore, and another particle, respectively. The particleparticle collision probability pp is proportional to the ratio of the membrane surface area effectively covered by particles to that of the entire membrane. The change of the uncovered membrane surface area can be expressed as: dAt = - 4  At dmt Equation (3.3)

where At [dimensionless] is the total uncovered or open membrane surface area at a given filtration time normalized to the total membrane surface area, [ At = (Auncovered /Ao), Ao is the total membrane surface area],  [m2/kg] is the projected area of a unit mass of the particles on membrane surface, and mt [kg/m2] is the total mass of particles introduced to the membrane per unit membrane surface area, which is equal to Cf Vs, Vs is the cumulative permeate flux [m3/m2] and Cf [kg/m3] is the solid concentration in the feed. The term ( 4 ) reflects the fact that a particle already landed on the open area of a membrane can collide with incoming particles moving into a circular area up to 4 times of the projected area of the particle; therefore, the effective loss of open area equals ( 4 )d m t .  pp [dimensionless] is the particle-to-particle attachment probability and ranges between zero and unity. When pp equals zero, the effective loss of open membrane area decreases to 23

dmt , indicating that incoming particles can "slide" off the surface of the attached particle after collision and arrive at the uncovered membrane surface. Comparatively, if pp increases to unity, the particles collide to each others have more affinity to coagulation attachment (particle-particle attachment); therefore, incoming particles moving in an area of 4dmt and will attach to the attached particle and prevent the open membrane areas underneath them from being reached by other incoming particles. Integration of Equation (3.3), using the initial condition: At = 1 when mt= 0, gives: At = exp (-4  mt ) pp = 1- exp (- 4  mt ) Equation (3.4) Equation (3.5) The collision probabilities for the fouled membrane can thus be written as follows:

For the collision probability between a particle and a pore on a clean membrane, it is simply the surface porosity (s) of the membrane times the uncovered area of the membrane. p = s exp (- 4  mt ) Equation (3.6)

The sum of the three collision probabilities is equal to unity. Therefore, the particle-tosurface collision probability can be written as: s = (1- s ) exp (- 4  mt ) dmp = pm p dmt Equation (3.7) Equation (3.8) Correspondingly, the specific mass of large particles that block membrane pores (mp) [kg/m2] where p refers to the collision probability between a particle and the membrane pores , and mt [kg/m2] is the total mass of particles delivered to a unit membrane surface area. Combining Equation (3.6) into Equation (3.8) and solving the differential equation to get the mass of large particles contributes to the pore blocking as follow: mpL = 4pp  [1 - exp (- 4pp L mt )]

Equation(3.9)

In order to predict the amount of particles participated in hydraulically irreversible fouling, the type of particle attachment in the cake layer has to be considered. Some particles directly attach to the membrane surface, and their mass per unit membrane area is defined as ms [kg/m2]. The mass of particles attaching to other particles on the membrane surface is defined as mpp [kg/m2], as illustrated in Figure (3.2) dms = pm s dmt msL =

3.1.2.2.Small particles (a < Dm/2) Particles that are smaller than the membrane pore size could attach to the membrane surface and contribute to the cake formation. Also, some small particles could penetrate clean membrane pores. Figure (3.3) depicts the fouling of UF membrane caused by colloidal particles smaller than its pore size. When the membrane is clean, the absence of a physical sieving effect gives particle 1 the opportunity to penetrate through the membrane pore. If the particle-membrane attachment is unfavorable, this particle goes directly through the membrane. Comparatively, particle 3 collides and attaches to the internal wall of the membrane pore, and hence, it creates the restriction to other small particles to move through the membrane pore. This also decreases the effective pore size of the membrane, resulting in an increase in the hydraulic resistance to the permeate flow through the pore, i.e. a decrease in the permeability of the membrane. Particle 3 represents the particles with radius less than 1/6 of the pore diameter (a  Dm/6 or
 

< 1/3) for standard pore blocking. In this small

size range the particles would attach to the pore wall since the attachment force would be higher than the drag force (Spinette and Charles, 2008). This type of particle attachment contributes to irreversible fouling. Another effect of pore constriction is shown with particle 5. In this case, the penetration of particle 6 through the membrane is prohibited because the physical size of the pore is now less than that of the particle. This happens when the radius of 25

the particle is in a critical range of 1/6 - 1/2 of pore diameter (Spinette and Charles, 2008). Meanwhile, particle 2 and particle 4 collide and attach with the outside surface of the membrane, similar to the large particles. Destabilized small particles are more likely to form aggregates before they reach the membrane surface. This scenario is presented as a cluster of particles 7. The aggregate of multiple small particles contributes to dense cake layer and results in an increase in the cake layer resistance. Consequently, small particles cause more fouling than large particles.

Figure 3.3: A diagram of UF membrane fouling by particles smaller than the membrane pore size. a. Small particles (a  Dm/6) (standard pore blocking) For very small particles with a < Dm/6, the particles tend to attach to the pore wall since the shear force would be lower than the attractive force between the particles and the pore wall (Spinette and Charles, 2008). To assess the collision and attachment of small particles on pore walls, as particle 3 shown in Figure 3.3, the convective transport of small particles inside cylindrical tubes in radial and axial directions under steady state conditions can be considered (Figure 3.4).

Figure 3.4: Schematic View of Cylindrical Membrane Pore First, a mass balance equation can be established for a ring-like slice of cylindrical shell in the straight pore channel as shown in Figure 3.4 (a): Jp,r+r [2  (r+r) Lm ] - Jp,r (2  rLm ) = 0 Equation (3.15) where Jp [kg/m2s] is the particle flux in the radial direction, Lm [m] is length of the membrane pore and r [m] is the radius. Fick's first law can be applied in the radial direction:

After backwashing, the transmembrane pressure increased, as compared to that with the clean membrane, when the membrane was placed back to the filtration cycle again. This is due to particles remaining in the membrane after backwashing.

Equation (3.44) 3.3.Model development for non-uniform pore size membrane In this study, a mechanistic model was developed and generalized for the applications with non-uniform pore size membranes, based on the fouling potential of the particles of different sizes with different pore sizes. 3.3.1. Simulation of the particles attachments with non-homogenous pore size distribution The size of the latex particles and membrane pores were regarded as the primary factor in determining the occurrence of surface fouling (cake layer formation or pore blocking) and adsorptive internal plugging. The heterogeneous membranes have pore size distribution of (N) non-uniform pore sizes. Notably, the individual pores are not aligned in a straight manner, and thus cause the flow to take a non-linear path with the length of the path greater than the path equal to the membrane thickness. Consequently, the tortuosity of the membrane will be included in the model expressions. Figure (3.5) illustrates the examples of all possible mechanisms involved in particle attachments with non-homogenous pore

membrane using ImageJ software [ImageJ 1.46r, National Institutes Of Health, USA]. These attachments are further discussed in Section 5.2.2.1 using SEM images of the membrane surface after ultrafiltration of the latex effluent. All possible attachments of each particle size are applied in the mathematical model for each pore size range. Eventually, the average percentage ( ) of each pore size() estimated by the software will be used in the model's calculations. 31

Figure 3.5: Illustration of all the mechanisms of particles attachments with nonhomogenous pore size distribution using ImageJ software Undoubtedly, at the beginning of the ultrafiltration process with clean membrane pores, the particles smaller than the pore size can penetrate the membrane, as long as the particle-membrane attachment is unfavorable such as with particles 1 and 2. As the process continues, particles gradually cover the surface and reduce the number of open pores available for the incoming particles, due to the depositional attachment (pm ) between the particle and membrane surface. Thus, the incoming particles have a lower probability of attachment to the pore surface, but a higher probability of having particle -to-particle attachments due to the coagulation attachment (pp ). Large particles (a  Dm/2), the ratio of the latex particle size to that of the pore through which it is passing is equal or larger than one, where a [m] is the particle radius and Dm [m] is the diameter of the membrane pore, could have a size similar to the membrane pore size, like particles 6 and 7, or larger like particles 3, 4, and 5. These large particles attach to the pore entrances and block the flow through these pores. In addition, particles that are smaller than the membrane pore size (a <Dm/2), the ratio of the latex particle size to that of the pore through which it is passing is less than one, can also get attached to the membrane surface and contribute to cake formation or go through clean membrane pores. Particles with radius less than 1/6 of the pore diameter (a  Dm/6 or < 1/3) , the ratio of the latex particle size to that of the pore through which it




is passing is less than one third, may collide with and get attached to the internal wall of the membrane pore (as particle 10), creating a potential restriction for the other small particles attempting to move through the membrane pore. As these particles continue to decrease the pore size of the membrane, they contribute to an increase of the hydraulic resistance to the permeate flow through the pore, in other words, they cause a decrease in the permeability of the membrane. Another effect of pore constriction is illustrated with particle 8. In the case of

32

this particle size (Dm /6  a  Dm /2), the ratio of the latex particle size to that of the pore through which it is passing is more than one third and less than 1, two particles can collide and block the membrane pore, thus effectually prohibiting the penetration of other particles through the membrane. Destabilized small particles are also more likely to form aggregates before they reach the membrane surface. This scenario is presented as a cluster of particles 9. The accumulation of multiple small particles contributes to the formation of the dense cake layer, resulting in an increase of the cake layer resistance. On the other hand, particles such as 11 or 12 do not block the pores when attached to the membrane surface, and have less impact on the passage of the permeate flow through the membrane. However, particles 11 and 12 still contribute to the cake layer formation. 3.3.2. Particles size classification 3.3.2.1. Large particles (particle size  pore diameter) (a  Dm/2) Based on the equation derived for the uniform pore size membrane and intended for calculating the mass of fouling contributed to pore blocking by larger sized particle, the equation was developed for non-uniform pore size membranes. For each average pore size ( = 1 to N), the mass of the particles larger than the pore of size  contributes to the pore blocking ( ) [kg/m2] and can be calculated from Equation (3.45)  = 4  [1 - exp (- 4 L    )]

where D is the diffusion coefficient of latex particles in water,  is the permeate flow rate in a membrane pore of size  , and a [m] is the particle radius. Accordingly, the total mass of particles attached to the membrane wall mw [kg/m2] can be calculated from Equation (3.50). In this case, the particles attached to the pores' wall contribute to the irreversible fouling as described in Section (3.1.2.2). mw =  =1   b. Models for small particles (Dm/6  a  Dm/2) Within this critical range, smaller particles would effectually block the internal membrane pores. Notably, the particle-to-particle attachment can be considered negligible inside the pores; i.e.  pp=0. The mass of the small particles contributing to the blocking of the pores of size ( )[kg/m2] is calculated from Equation (3.51), while the total mass of small particles contributing to pore blocking mpS [kg/m2] is calculated from Equation (3.52), as the model was developed for non-uniform pore size membrane.  =

Mass of particles contributing to the cake layer could be calculated by subtracting the mass of particles from all sizes contributing to pore blocking, from the total mass of particles in the feed with the potential for particle-to-particle attachment.

Equation (3.55) 3.3.4. Modeling of irreversible fouling The type of particle attachment in the cake layer must be accounted for in order to accurately predict the quantity of the particles participating in the hydraulically irreversible fouling. In most cases, some of the particles get attached directly to the membrane's surface. The mass per unit membrane area of these particles can be ascribed as ms [kg/m2] and can be calculated from Equation (3.56).  =

In addition, the mass of the particles getting attached to other particles already situated on the membrane surface was outlined in the previous section for uniform pore size membrane and defined as mpp [kg/m2], and is presented in Equation (3.57). Furthermore, the particles attached to the pore wall  also contribute to the irreversible membrane fouling, as discussed in Section (3.1.2.2).

3.3.5. Mathematical model for transmembrane pressure The mathematical model was combined with Hermia model in order to expand the models specifically for the transmembrane pressure prediction, as demonstrated in our previous section for uniform pore size membranes. The reduction of the membrane permeability, predominantly as a consequence of pore blockage and cake layer formation, results in an increase of the relative transmembrane pressure (P'). P' is defined as the increase of transmembrane pressure TMP during the filtration process normalized with respect to clean membranes [dimensionless]. P' is a function of the particle mass retained by the membrane. The increase of transmembrane pressure, due to the large and small particles participating in the pore blocking, can be calculated using Equations (3.61) and (3.62), respectively.

Equation (3.63)

The increase of transmembrane pressure due to the cake layer formation can be written as:
    = 1 +   [pp    - ( =1   - =1   - =1   )]




Equation (3.64) Accordingly, the increase of total transmembrane membrane pressure during a filtration process can be calculated from Equation (3.65) P= 1 +

In fact, after the backwash process, the minimum transmembrane pressure required for the permeate to pass through the membrane is increased in comparison to the transmembrane pressure occurring with the clean membrane. This could be attributed to the accumulation of the irreversible fouling particles, including the irreversible cake layer and the irreversible fouling on the membrane pore wall. Owing to this, the increase of transmembrane pressure after backwash (P IRR) can be calculated from Equation (3.67)
 P IRR = P cIRR +

Equation (3.67) Based on the particle size distribution of latex paint and the pore size distribution of the heterogeneous membrane used in this study, the fouling probabilitiespp and pm , were calculated using the model equations. Equation (3.68) and Equation (3.55) for the total mass of fouling contributed to pore blocking (mp) and the total mass of fouling contributed to cake formation (mc), were then solved for pp and pm using mp and mc measured

experimentally as described in Section (4.5). Eventually, these predicted fouling attachment probabilities were used to calculate the increase of transmembrane pressure from Equation (3.65), which were validated by comparing them with experimentally measure values.

Modeling of fouling attachments Predictive models for an accurate estimation of fouling attachments at a given

operating condition were developed and validated

for homogeneous and heterogeneous

membranes of different types and with a variety of MWCO values, as illustrated in Section (5.6.1,5.6.3,5.6.4).The fouling model and the fouling attachment correlations found in the present study form a comprehensive set of predictive models, applicable to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes in a variety of materials with different molecular weight cut off (MWCO) values.

3.5.

Attachment model development including sphericity of contaminant particles In this study a mechanistic model was developed and generalized for application with

uniform and non-uniform pore size membranes, based on the fouling potential of the different

37

particle sizes and featuring a variety of pore sizes. Due to the fact that the contaminated particle sizes may be larger or smaller than each pore size within the overall range of the membrane, the size of the latex particles and membrane pores were regarded as the primary factors in determining the occurrence of surface fouling (cake layer formation or pore blocking) and adsorptive internal plugging. Furthermore, the sphericity value of the particles (), defined as the ratio of the surface area of a sphere of the same volume as the given particle to the surface area of the particle, would have a significant effect on the fouling phenomenon for each of the tested pore sizes, as shown in Figure 3.6. Therefore, the model was developed to include the sphereicty of latex particles while evaluating its effectiveness in the model prediction. As a consequence, the fouling attachment model accounts for most of the characteristic variables that influence fouling phenomenon, such as, the membrane surface charge (), the membrane pores tortuosity (), and the sphericity of contaminated particles ().

CHAPTER 4 MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this chapter, details of the experimental setup designed for the ultrafiltration process of latex paint effluent, procedure, materials, and analytical methods are summarized. 4.1. Experimental set-up A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 4.1. It includes a 1.0 hp feed pump and a flow meter (Model F-400N, Blue White Industries Ltd., USA, ± 5% ) ranging from 1.0 to 7.0 L/min. The liquid feed pressure is monitored using a pressure transducer (Model V82/V182/V782, George Fischer, USA). Three pressure sensors (0-100 psi) (Model Omega PX303-100G5V, ± 0.25%) connected to the data acquisition system to measure the pressure in the filtration unit and to evaluate the pressure influence on cake layer thickness. The permeate stream is continuously measured gravimetrically using an electronic balance, ± 0.1 g (Model Adventurer Pro AV2101, Ohaus Corporation, New Jersey, USA). Both the pressure transducers and the electronic balance are connected to a data acquisition system. The membrane filtration unit is constructed of two acrylic plates held together by nuts and bolts. The gap between the two plates for the liquid flow was 2 mm. O-rings were used to seal the two plates of the unit. There were 2 rectangular slits; one on each end of the unit, for the feed inlet and the reject outlet. The membrane sheet area was 28 cm x 8 cm that was supported by a porous stainless steel disc, as shown in Figure 4.2. 4.2. Ultrafiltration membranes Polycarbonate membrane filters with uniform nominal pore size of 0.01 µm, 0.05 µm and 0.1 µm (GE water & Process Technologies) were used as homogeneous membranes for the experimental work. These membranes are hydrophilic with narrow pore size distributions which were manufactured using track etching. Table 4.1 shows the membrane characteristics. The membrane filters were available in large sheets, 300mm x 3000mm is size, which were easily cut to the desired shape and dimensions. Polycarbonate Chemical Structure illustrated in Appendix (D). Furthermore, Polysulfone membrane with MWCO of 60,000 and with the chemical structure of [OC6H4OC6H4SO2C6H4]n (GE Water & Process Technologies), Ultrafilic membrane with MWCO of 100,000 and with the chemical structure of (C3H3N)n (GE Water & Process Technologies), Cellulose Acetate with MWCO of 20,000 and with the

39

chemical structure of [C6H7O2(OH)3]n (GE Water & Process Technologies), and Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membrane with MWCO of 100,000 and with the chemical structure of (C2H2F2)n (Koch Membrane Systems) were used as heterogeneous non-uniform pore size membranes.

4.3.Feed solution 4.3.1. Latex paint dispersion In large tank, a measured volume of latex paint (Type: Glidden Easyflow Interior Latex Paint, White, Flat) will be added to distilled water at different feed solid concentrations. Vinyl acrylic latex [CH2CHCOOCH2CH]n is used as the binder. However, the exact composition of the paint is proprietary. Latex paint pH is 9 and density is 1.34 kg/L. The volume of latex paint used varied with the solid concentration required using the analytical method for solid content. As an example, in order to obtain a feed solid concentration of 0.13%, 2.5 ml of latex paint is added to each liter of distilled water used. Lastly, during the experiments, distilled water was used for the preparation of the feed. A simulated latex effluent with a pH value of 7 was used. The zeta potential of latex particles at pH of 7 was approximately -26.61 mV. 4.3.2. Monodisperse particles Monodisperse polystyrene nano-spheres of size 50 nm and 100 nm (MicrospheresNanospheres Company, New York, USA) was used for model validation of non-uniform pore size membranes at different concentrations. 4.4.Analytical methods 4.4.1. Solid content A measured mass of each feed sample was transferred to a metal dish that was placed in an oven at 105ºC for more than a week. The mass of each dish was periodically measured using an electronic balance (Mettler Toledo Model AB 54-S Fact, Switzerland, ± 0.1 mg), approximately every three days, until there was no change. From the measured masses of the solution and the solid in the metal dish, the solid content of the paint solution was determined. 4.4.2. Particle size distribution of latex paint dispersion The particle size distribution of the latex paint solution was determined using a particle size analyzer (Model 2000 -Malvern Mastersizer) which had a range of 0.02 to 2000 microns. The particle size distribution of the latex feed solution ranges from 0.03 microns (30 nanometers) to 800 microns, as illustrated in Figure 4.3. The concentration of samples didn't affect the particle size distribution obtained. For the accuracy of the measurement, three identical measurements were performed at each feed concentration. In addition, the particle size distribution of the collected permeate was measured three times for each of the samples so as to ensure the accuracy of measurments. 41

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging To obtain surface images of the membrane before and after filtration, a scanning electron microscope (Model JEOL, JSM-6380 LV, Oxford Instrument, U.K.) was used. A clean membrane sample was coated with a thin layer of gold particles to improve the resolution of the images. Figure 4.4 (a) shows that the surface of the Polycarbonate homogenous membrane had a high pore density, but the pores were arranged in a random distribution. Figure 4.4 (b) zooms into an area of the membrane surface. From this image, it can be seen that the pores are predominantly circular (or cylindrical) in nature. Measuring of the dimensions of the pore openings showed that the majority of the pore sizes were about 0.1 µm.

4.4.4. Confocal laser microscope imaging To provide an evidence of particles attachments in membrane pores, surface images of the membrane after filtration were obtained using Confocal Microscope ( Eclipse 90i , Nikon Instruments Inc., USA). Fluospheres Carboxylate Modified Microspheres (latex beads) of

Orange Fluorescent with the size of 0.1 microns and zeta potential of -56 mV were used. The images were analyzed using NIS-Elements Microscope Imaging software (NIS-Elements AR 3.1 Microscope Imaging Software, Nikon Instruments Inc., USA). Figure 4.5. presented the attachments of Fluospheres Carboxylate microspheres latex beads inside the membrane layers.

Figure 4.5: Confocal laser microscope image of Polysulfone membrane layers after ultrafiltration process using fluospheres carboxylate latex beads 4.4.5. Turbidity measurements The turbidity of permeate was measured for each of the experimental runs using the Turbidimeter (La Motte 2020 we TurbidimeterTurbidimeter, USA, ±2%). Turbidity is a measure of how clear the water is. High turbidity means that there are a lot of particles suspended in the water and light cannot get through. The allowable turbidity in drinking water cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). 4.4.6. Membrane surface charge measurements (zeta potential ) The zeta potentials of latex particles and the membrane surface were measured using a zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer Nano Series, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK, ±0.01 mV). The zeta potentials of the untreated membranes used in the present study were -36.67 mV, -42.40 mV, -41.50 mV, -2.50 mV, and -33.90 mV for polycarbonates, polysulfone, ultrafilic, PVDF,

and cellulose acetate membranes, respectively. 43

The membrane surface charge was adjusted using a soaking solution in an MPT-2 autotitrator of the zeta potential analyzer (ZetasizerNano Series, Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK, ± 0.01 MV). The acidity or the alkalinity of the soaking solution was adjusted by using 0.1 N H2SO4 or 0.1 N NaOH. The membrane sheets were immersed in the solutions for 2 hours since this period was optimal for the adsorption of the OH- or H+ group on the membrane surface after the preliminary experiments. This time was estimated based on the preliminary experiments for the stability of the surface charge after the ultrafiltration process, as shown in Appendix (I). Polysulfone membrane zeta potentials of -10.00 mV, -20.00 mV, -30.00 mV, -40.00 mV, and 50.00 mV, were respectively obtained after immersing in soaking solutions at pH values of 2.4, 4.1, 5.7, 6.8, and 10.9. The Ultrafilic membrane with zeta potentials of -15.00 mV and -30.00 mV were obtained at pH values of 2.8, and 6, respectively. Moreover, the zeta potential of the back surface of the membrane sheet was measured after each ultrafiltration run to check the stability of the surface charge of treated membranes. For the experiments of treated membrane surface, a simulated latex effluent with a pH of 7 was used in all runs. In order to ensure the accuracy of the zeta potential measurement, three identical measurements were performed. This will be discussed in details in Section 5.2. The zeta potential of latex particles at a solution pH of 7 was approximately -26.61 mV. In the case of membrane surface charge treatment using an anionic surfactant, the flat membrane sheets were immersed in Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate (LAS), having the chemical structure as [(CH3)2(CH2)9CHC6H4-SO3Na], at different concentrations and varied treatment times. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of LAS is 0.1 g/L. LAS was also added at different concentrations to the simulated latex effluent in order to investigate its effect on the ionic strength of the latex solution and the zeta potential of latex particles. 4.4.7. Acidity and alkalinity of latex solution The latex solution pH was adjusted with the aids of a pH transmitter (Mettlertoledo pH Transmitters 2100e, Mettler Toledo, Germany, <0.02 pH). The solution acidity was increased using 0.1N H2SO4 or 0.1N HCl in order to investigate the effects of the divalent and monovalent acids on the membrane fouling attachments. Similarly, 0.1N NaOH was used to increase the alkalinity of the latex solution. Experiments were carried out in the pH value range between 3 and 12. The conductivity of the latex solution [mS/cm] was measured at each pH value using a

44

conductivity meter (Model 4063 Traceable® Portable Conductivity Meter, Control Company, USA, ± 0.3%). 4.4.8. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) The aggregation and the shape of the particles was confirmed by Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Bruker Daltonics Ltd., East Milton, ON, CANADA). The elastic scattering of X-rays (wavelength 0.1 - 0.2 nm) by the latex solution samples was recorded at very low angles (typically 0.1 - 10°). SAXS was capable of delivering key structural information on macromolecules. 4.5. Operating procedure In a feed tank, a measured volume of latex paint (Type: Glidden Easyflow Interior Latex Paint, White, Flat) was mixed with distilled water to get a solution at a specific feed solid concentration. Vinyl acrylic latex is used as the binder in the paint. However, the exact composition of the paint is proprietary. Latex solution pH was at 9.0, and the density was 1.34 kg/L. The volume of latex paint used varied with the solid concentration required. For example, in order to obtain a feed solid concentration of 0.13% by weight, 2.5 ml of latex paint was used for each liter of solution. The temperature of the solution was kept at room temperature. Flow rates ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 L/min were used in experiments. Operating pressures from 3.0 to 5.0 psi for the 0.1µm membrane and from 5.0 to 12 psi for the 0.05µm membrane were used with varied feed solid concentrations of 0.78 kg/m3, 1.3 kg/m3 and 1.82 kg/m3. Experiments using clean distilled water as the feed were also performed. Mass of latex particles retained by the membrane was measured to predict the fouling probabilities. The predicted transmembrane pressures were validated using experimentally measured values. For each experimental run, a membrane sheet was placed in the membrane filtration unit. The feed tank was filled with a latex paint solution at a specific solid concentration. The solution was mixed in the tank via the recycle line by fully opening valve V-1. At the start of the experimental run, the feed valve, V-2, and the reject valve, V-4, were opened slowly in order to set the pressure and the flow rate to appropriate values. If a high pressure was necessary, the reject valve, V-4, were opened less than the valve setting for lower operating pressures at the same feed flow rate while the feed valve, V-2, was opened slightly more. The reject stream is not 45

returned to the feed tank so to have a continuous steady state filtration process with a specific feed concentration. Measurements of the pressure of the feed stream entering the filtration unit were displayed on a computer monitor and recorded at one-second intervals. The permeate stream was collected on an electronic balance that was also connected to the data acquisition for accurate and automatic recording of the permeate mass collected over time. The run time was kept constant for all experiments to investigate the influence of the operating conditions on the mass of particles retained by the membrane, the permeate flux and the fouling attachments. Furthermore, cross flow backwash experiments were performed for model validation and restore membrane fluxes at different conditions. The total mass of fouling (mt) is the difference in weight of the membrane before and after filtration. For measuring the mass of particles contributing to cake layer (mc), the cake was scratched off under the microscope, so as to keep the membranes pores blocked with the particles contributing to the pore blocking. The scratched off solid portion was then weighted in order to determine the amount of cake layer. The blocked pores of the membrane were checked using SEM. The mass of particles contributing to pore blocking (mp), is the difference between the weight of the membrane before filtration (clean membrane) and the weight after the cake layer was scratched off. The mass of particles (mt, mc and mp) was measured using an electronic balance (Mettler Toledo Model AB 54-S Fact, Switzerland, ± 0.1 mg). Figure 4.6 (a) presents SEM images of the membrane surface after the ultrafiltration of the latex solution, and before the cake layer was scratched off, which represent the total mass of solids (mt). The SEM image of the membrane surface after the cake layer was scratched off for the measurments of mc and mp, as shown in Figure 4.6 (b). As clarified by a higher magnification in Figure 4.6 (c), the particles blocked the membrane pores and were trapped inside the membrane matrix.

Membrane fouling remediation Experimental work was extended for fouling remediation using different techniques by improving the antifouling properties of the membrane and pre-treating the feed to limit its fouling propensity. The goal was to minimize membrane fouling of latex effluent by altering the membrane surface charge or the ionic strength of the simulated latex effluent either through the pH change or using anionic surfactants. The influence of the ionic strength, via varying of the solution pH or adding anionic surfactant, on the fouling attachments, the total mass of fouling, cumulative permeate volume per unit area, and the specific power consumption was investigated. The impact of membrane surface treatment on improving the anti-fouling properties of the membrane, membrane fouling remediation, and decreasing the specific power consumption was also studied. In addition, the effect of cationic surfactant on the latex particle size distribution was investigated at different concentrations, various treatment times, and diverse agitation duration. The effects of cationic surfactant on the zeta potential of latex particles and membrane surfaces were also investigated. In addition the effect of cationic surfactant on fouling attachments, total mass of fouling, cumulative permeate volume per unit is, and the specific power consumption was also investigated. Preliminary experiments were performed to check the optimum mixing time, duration, and surfactant concentration to get the largest particles size distribution after aggregation using cationic surfactant or the optimum membrane and latex particles surface charge using anionic surfactant. This optimum mixing time, duration, and surfactant concentration were used during the ultrafiltration process.

47

4.6.1. Feed pre-treatment The pH of simulated latex effluent was varied to investigate the effects of the solution pH over a range from 3-12 on particle-particle attachment and particle-membrane attachment since those attachment potentials strongly affect the volumetric permeate flux, the total mass of fouling, and the specific power consumption. Furthermore, cationic and anionic surfactants were used to control membrane fouling and minimize the specific power consumption. As part of the current research study, dodecylamine cationic surfactant was also tested. Dodecylamine has a melting point of 27-30°C and thus cannot be used at room temperature. This condition effectually leads to significantly higher power consumption. As a consequence, Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide was found to be a more appropriate cationic, since it remains liquid at room temperature. Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) [C19H42BrN], a cationic surfactant, was added to the latex solution in order to investigate its effect on the latex particle size distribution, the zeta potential of latex particles, and the zeta potential of the membrane surface at various concentrations and different treatment times. The reported CMC of CTAB is 0.00092M (Murkerjee and Mysels, 1971) or approximately 0.36 g/L. Another cationic surfactant, Dodecylamine, was also tested (Surfactants details illustrated in Appendix E) Anionic surfactant might increase the ionic strength of the solution and the zeta potential (surface charge) of the latex particles and the membrane surface. These charges would result in the increasing of the repulsion force between latex particles and the membrane surface, hence, increase the permeate flux and reduce membrane fouling. The selected anionic surfactant was Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate Standard LAS. 4.6.2. Enhancement of anti-fouling properties of the membrane The membrane surface negativity was enhanced to increase the repulsion force between the latex particles and the membranes, as described in Section 4.4.6. 4.7. Experimental design 4.7.1. Central Composite Face-Centered CCF The Central Composite Face-Centered CCF Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the experimental design method (Montgomery, 1997). Fouling attachment probabilities (pp and pm), total mass of fouling, and the specific power consumption were the main responses. The main operational process parameters investigated for the membrane

48

ultrafiltration process are the transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, and feed concentration. The temperature of the solution was kept at room temperature (22-24°C). Operation time for each experiment was kept constant for each of the experimental runs in order to investigate the influence of the operating conditions on mass of particles retained by membrane, permeate flux, fouling probabilities, and cake height. The ranges of the operating conditions are shown in Table 4.2. Table 4.2: Process parameter levels Factor A B C Variable Transmembrane Pressure Feed Flow rate Feed concentration Range Low High (-1) (+1) 15 35 1 7 0.78 1.82 Unit psi LPM kg/m3

Twenty experiments were performed and their results were then analyzed using multiregression. For the minimization of error, six replicated experiments at zero code for each process parameter were performed in randomized order. Statistical software (Stat-Ease, Version 8.0 Stat-Ease Inc., USA) was used to determine the best-fitting model by regression and stepwise elimination. The coefficients for the complete model were evaluated by regression analysis and tested for their respective significance. The significance of the coefficients was then assessed by an F-test, and the insignificant coefficients were promptly excluded. The p-value was used to set the level of confidence for the F-test. The model's adequacy and efficacy were then evaluated by the coefficients of determination (R2) and the analysis of variances (ANOVA). Stat-Ease software was further used to identify the process parameters for the ultrafiltration fouling of latex solution that have minimum fouling attachment probabilities. The quadratic and linear regression models can be expressed as Equations (4.1) and (4.2) below:

4.7.2. Central Composite Centered (CCC) For model development, it was crucial to introduce the surface charge as zeta potential () of the membrane surface into our predictive model so as to be generalized for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes. Therefore, in a part of the current study the investigated operational process parameters were: transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, feed concentration, and the zeta potential of Polysulfone membrane surface. The solution temperature was maintained constant at room temperature (22-24 °C). Throughout this study, the ultrafiltration time for each experiment was kept constant (25 minutes), in order to analyze the impact of the operating conditions and the surface charge on fouling attachments probabilities in the experimental design. As a sequence, the influence on the total mass of fouling, cumulative filtration volume per unit area, and specific power consumption could be accurately investigated. In this study, the Central Composite Centered (CCC) Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the experimental design method. The coagulation and the depositional attachments are the main responses. The four process parameters of the study include: transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, feed concentration, and zeta potential of the membrane surface. Table 4.3 presents coded and actual levels of the process parameters. To maintain a high level of accuracy, each process parameter features five levels with four parameter interactions. A total of thirty (30) experiments were performed and their results were then rigorously analyzed using multi-regression. Zero code represents the average range value for each process parameter. In order to minimize the error margin, six replicated experiments at zero code for each process parameter were performed in random order. To determine the best-fitting model of the process of regression and stepwise elimination, statistical software (Stat-Ease, Version 8.0 Stat-Ease Inc., USA) was applied. Next, the coefficients for a full model were assessed through regression analysis, and then tested for their significance. The F-test was implemented to assess the significance of the coefficients, after which the insignificant coefficients were excluded accordingly. P-value analysis was used to set the level of confidence for the F-test. The coefficients of determination (R2) and the analysis of variances (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the model fitting.

4.8. Specific power consumption calculations During the filtration process, the resistance to the permeate flow can be increased due to the pore blockage and the cake layer formation, resulting in the membrane fouling. Hence, the permeate flux noticeably declines with filtration time. A higher permeate flux can be attained by augmenting the transmembrane pressure, which in turn causes a higher energy consumption. The specific power consumption per unit volume of filtrate was calculated using Equation (4.3). Equation (4.3) is illustrated in details in Appendix (F). Specific power consumption [

4.9. Estimation of the pore size distribution The non-uniform pore size distribution of the Polysulfone membrane was estimated using the ImageJ software. Figure 4.8 (a) presents an SEM image of the clean Polysulforne membrane. The membrane consists of multiple layers featuring pores in a non-straight (non-linear) alignment. The ImageJ software viewer identifies the pores by using volume rendering for displaying image volumes and transferring pixels in such a way that darker pixels are more transparent than lighter pixels. The images are displayed as multiOrthoslice. The technique behind converting the images using ImageJ software was explained in details in a recent study on this subject (Schmid et al., 2010). The specific pores were selected, as demonstrated in Figure 4.8 (b), and the exact pore sizes were determined with the help of the software based on spherical approximation technique. The pore size intervals were allocated by the software. In order to ensure accurate representation of the membrane pore size distribution, several SEM images were taken at random locations on the membrane surface. Also, each SEM image was analyzed three times using the software in a randomized order. The resulting analysis indicated that the pore size distribution for each SEM image was identical, which provided the evidence necessary to validate the applicability of the software to measurements of pore sizes and pore size distribution. The resulting pore size distribution was represented using 10 pore size distributions as shown in Figure 4.9. Pore size distribution of other heterogeneous membranes estimated from ImageJ software is illustrated in Appendix (G).

The particles were selected, as demonstrated in Figure 4.10 (b), and the exact charcterstic diameters were determined with the help of the software and based on the SEM magnification scale, as illustrated in Figure 4.10 (c). The particle size intervals were allocated by the software, and the sphericity of the particles was estimated using the ratio of the diameters of the smallest and largest circumscribed circles around latex particle (Rodriguez et at., 2012), as shown in Figure 4.11. In order to ensure accurate representation of the sphericity measurements, several SEM images of latex particles, approximately 30 images, were taken so as to cover the whole range of particle size distribution. Also, each SEM image was carefully analysed three separate times in a randomized order with the help of the software. The analysis indicated that the measurements of average sphericity for each particle size range were identical, which provided the necessary evidence for the validation of the software.

Figure 4.11: The diameters of the smallest and largest circumscribed circles around latex particle used for sphericity estimation 4.10.1. Calculating the sphericity for each particle size range in case of using Polysulfone membrane As previously discussed, the attachment model was developed based on the fouling potential of the different sizes particles and a range of pore sizes. The sizes of contaminated particles may be larger or smaller than each membrane pore size range. Therefore, for each pore size of the (N) pore size distribution, as portrayed in Figure 4.9, the particles will be divided according to whether they are large particles, small particles, or very small particles. The mean particle size dmean was calculated for the particle size distribution of simulated latex effluent with a solid concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, as shown in Figure 4.12. The mean particle size dmean was calculated using the Equation (4.4) (Lambert et al., 1967; Akbari et al., 2011). For the sphericity of the particle size ranges needed for the model calculations, the particle size ranges were selected based on the pore size distribution of the membrane for the particle size classification. The sphericity of each dmean range was shown in Figure 4.13.

CHAPTER 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
5.1.Model Prediction Model simulation results indicate that the depositional (particle-to-membrane) attachment is primarily responsible for reversible and irreversible membrane fouling. Irreversible fouling is the mass of particles still attached to the membrane after backwash. It is the combination of individual portions that can be calculated from equations (3.14) and (3.22) for the amounts of large and small particles contributing to irreversible fouling, respectively, plus equation (3.28) for the amount of very small particles irreversibly attached to the membrane wall. Reversible fouling is the mass of particles blocked the membrane pores, which can be removed during backwash. Reversible fouling can be calculated from equations (3.9) and (3.26) for the amounts of large and small particles contributing to pore blocking, respectively. As shown in Figure 5.1, increases in the particle-to-membrane surface attachment probability, pm, result in higher transmembrane pressures. This might be due to the increase in the mass of particles participated in pore blocking and attached to the membrane surface, ms, which is considered hydraulically irreversible after backwash in the mathematical model. Correspondingly, irreversible fouling increased substantially as indicated by the increase in the transmembrane pressure due to pore blocking. From the perspective of chemical attachment, hydraulically irreversible fouling occurs when the attachment interaction between the particles and the membrane surface are strong enough to overcome by hydrodynamic forces generated during hydraulic backwash. However, depositional attachment leading to the cake formation has insignificant effect on the transmembrane pressure.

57

Figure 5.1: Effect of depositional attachment probability on transmembrane pressure On the other hand, the particles instability with respect to coagulation (particle-to-particle attachment) has a competitive effect to the depositional attachment and usually results in a decrease of the total irreversible fouling. Figure 5.2 shows that the transmembrane pressure TMP due to the cake layer formation increases with the increasing of particle-to-particle probability (pp). Coagulation forms bigger particle aggregates that reduce the probability of standard pore blocking. Therefore, the total amount of irreversible fouling decreased because the cake layer could be hydraulically backwashed. Consequently, TMP due to irreversible fouling decreased. Also, it can be noticed that the particle-particle attachment probability has an insignificant effect on the increase of the transmembrane pressure due to pore blocking.

58

Figure 5.2: Effect of coagulation attachment probability on transmembrane pressure The effect of depositional fouling probability (the particle-to-membrane probability, pm) on the mass of particles attached to membrane pores, which contributed to pore blocking, was also simulated. The mass of particles attached to the membrane increases with the depositional fouling probability, as shown in Figure 5.3. This indicates that the particles have a higher tendency to attach to the membrane than other particles. Also, increases in the feed solid concentration result in higher amounts of particles retained by the membrane due to pore blocking since more solid particles are introduced to the membrane surface. Similarly, as can be seen in Figure 5.4, the total mass retained by the membrane increases with the depositional probability, pm, and the permeate flux. Again, more mass would be retained by the membrane at a higher volumetric permeate flux because more solid particles would be brought to the pores, and hence, the chance of pore blocking increases.

59

60

Figure 5.5 presents the effect of the coagulation fouling probability, pp, on the mass of solid retained by the membrane at different feed solid concentrations. Increases in the particle-toparticle attachment (coagulation) probability lead to higher amounts of particles participating in the cake formation as previously shown in Figure 5.2. On the other hand, the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking decreases with the coagulation probability, as can be seen in Figure 5.5. At a higher particle-to-particle attachment probability, particles in liquid tend to attach to particles already deposited on the membrane surface, and hence, the cake formation would be further facilitated. Consequently, less solid particles would be available to participate in pore blocking.

Figure 5.5: Effect of coagulation fouling probability on solid retained by membrane at different feed solid concentrations. 5.2.Mathematical model validation 5.2.1 Uniform pore size membrane Each parameter of the mathematical models was tested to evaluate the effect of changing the membrane properties, feed flow rate, volumetric permeate flux, pressure and feed concentration on the parameters. Table 5.1 shows the experimental results of the total mass of particles retained by the polycarbonate membrane, the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking, the mass of particles contributing to the cake layer, the volumetric permeate flux and the transmembrane pressure obtained at different operational conditions. For the total mass of fouling (mt), it's the difference in the weight of the membrane before and after filtration. For the 61

mass of particles contributing to the cake layer (mc), the cake layer was removed (scratched off) slowly and carefully under an optical microscope so to keep the membranes pores blocked with the particles contributing to pore blocking. The scratched off solid was then weighed to determine the amount of the cake layer. The blocked pores of the membrane were checked using SEM. For the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking (mp), it's the difference in the weight of the membrane before filtration (clean membrane) and after scratching off the cake layer. Time was kept constant for all experimental runs with the 0.1 µm membrane with same initial feed concentration to investigate the influence of the operating conditions on the amount of particles retained by the membrane, the permeate flux and the fouling probability. All experiments were carried out at the operating conditions above the critical flux as fouling was observed in all experiments. It can be seen in Table 5.1 that the volumetric permeate flux and the mass of particles retained by the membrane increased with the feed flow rate and pressure. For the membrane with a pore size of 0.05 µm, higher feed flow rate and pressure were required to obtain a volumetric permeate flux similar to that of the membrane with a pore size of 0.1 µm. For example, at a volumetric permeate flux of 0.007 m3/m2 with the 0.1 µm membrane, the required pressure and feed flow rate were 3.0 psi and 1.0 L/min, respectively. However, in order to achieve a similar permeate flux with the 0.05 µm membrane, the required pressure and the feed flow rate were more than 2 times of those for the 0.1 µm membrane. In addition, increases in the feed concentration resulted in increases in the amounts of particles contributing to the pore blocking and the cake layer; hence, the total mass of the particles retained by the membrane increased, almost 1 to 1 ratio. When the feed flow rate and pressure were increased from 13L/min and 3-5 psi, the volumetric permeate flux and the total mass of fouling particles increased almost 10 times from 0.007 to 0.064 m3/m2 and 0.1202 to 1.11 g, respectively. At higher permeate flows, more solid particles were brought to the membrane, resulting in higher mass of retained particles. With a smaller membrane pore size 0.05 µm under the same operating conditions (the feed flowrate Q= 2 LPM and pressure P = 4 psi), the volumetric permeate flux decreased from 0.04 m3/m2 to 0.0189 m3/m2, resulting in a reduction of the mass of fouling retained by membrane from 0.652 g to 0.378 g due to lower attachment probabilities.

which contributed to the pore blocking, mp, or the cake layer, mc, were used in the model to predict the fouling probabilities, pp and pm, as shown in Table 5.2. The estimated attachment probabilities were then used to determine the increase in the transmembrane pressure. The transmembrane pressures predicted from the mathematical models are within ±5.3-7.7% error of the experimental values for 0.1 µm and 0.05µm membranes. The estimated values appear to be always less than the experimental values. This might be due to the fact that in the present study, membrane fouling was treated as the interactions of suspended particles and membranes with uniform pore size distribution and structure, for the purpose of simplicity. Therefore, the potential impact of system heterogeneity was overlooked. This will be further investigated in the near future. For backwashing at flow rates from 2-4 LPM, mass of irreversible fouling predicted from the model agrees with the total amount of solid fouling experimentally measured within 10 % error. Figure 5.6. presents SEM images of membrane pores before and after backwash. The larger and dark spots in Figure 5.6 (b) indicate clean and opened pores after backwashing.

As shown Table 5.2, when the feed flow rate was increased from 1.0 L/min to 3.0 L/min, the particle-to-particle attachment probability decreased from 1.0 to 0.7 while the depositional attachment (particle-to-membrane) probability increased from 0.10 to 0.82. Particle-tomembrane attachment probability (pm) varied more drastically with the feed flow rate, as compared to pp. A higher feed flow rate provided a higher shear rate applied on the particles at the cake layer, resulting in a higher amount of particles washed away from the cake layer. Consequently, the resultant particle-to-particle attachment probability (pp) decreased. On the other hand, the permeate flux increased with the feed flowrate. As a result, more particles were brought into contact with the membrane, leading to a higher particle-to-membrane attachment probability (pm). However, both depositional attachment probability (pm) and coagulation attachment probability (pp) decreased with decreases in the feed solid concentration. It is evident that at a lower solid concentration, the number of particles in the feed stream was lower. Therefore, chance for particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment would be lower; and hence, the depositional attachment probability (pm) and coagulation attachment probability (pp) were lower. The effect of the feed solid concentration is more prominent on pp. This might be due to the fact that at a higher solid concentration, more suspended particles present in liquid enhanced collision and attachment between particles, resulting in a higher pp while the volumetric permeate flux Vs had a stronger effect on pm.

Figure 5.7 presents SEM images of membrane after ultrafiltration to illustrate the effect of the feed flow rate on the cake build-up. Figure 5.7 (a) was obtained with a sample at a feed flow rate of 1.0 L/min, showing a thick cake (average thickness of about 6.2 µm). The thickness of the membrane is about 6 µm. Figure 5.7 (b) shows that the cake thickness decreased to about 2.7 µm when the feed flow rate was increased to 3.0L/min. The liquid cross flow over the membrane can be considered as continuous washing of the cake layer. At a higher feed flowrate, a higher shear rate applied on the particles deposited at the cake layer; hence, more particles were washed away, resulting in a thinner cake layer. In addition, as the feed flow rate was increased, the concentration polarization effect decreased. Therefore, the accumulated particles on the membrane surface returned back to the bulk fluid and the concentration polarization effect diminished. The osmotic pressure thus decreased, resulting in an increase in the permeation flux.

The monodisperse particles of 0.05 µm contributed as large particles to the membrane pores (Particle diameter  pore diameter), as the particle size was equal the pore size. This model for predicting the increase in transmembrane pressure agreed with the increase in transmembrane pressure obtained experimentally and measured within ±2.2 to 11.6 % error.

5.2.2. Model validation using heterogeneous membrane with non-uniform pore size 5.2.2.1.Fouling attachment with a non-homogenous pore size membrane It was necessary to validate the simulation of particle attachments with non-homogenous pore size distribution (Section 3.3.1), so as to provide the evidence that would support the mathematical model based on particle attachments. In order to have a clear set of SEM images of the attachments between particles and Polysulfone membrane pores, latex solution was used at a low concentration of 0.1 kg/m3 (0.2 ml per liter). Figure 5.8 represents all of the possible attachments between the large particles (particle diameter  pore diameter) and the membrane pores. Particles larger than the pore size, as Particles 3, 4 and 5 in Figure 1, were circled in the SEM image in Figure 6. On the other hand, the particle blocking the membrane pore is indicated with a square around it in Figure 5.8, due to its exact pore-size, similar to Particles 6 and 7 in Figure 3.5.

Figure 5.9 (a) demonstrates the blockage of the membrane pores with two parties (Dm/6  a  Dm/2) and thus provides the evidence of the presence of Particle 8 in the simulation (Figure 1). Figure 5.9 (b) represents the attachments of the tiny particles (a  Dm/6), like Particle 10 in Figure 1.

(c) Figure 5.9: SEM images of small particles attached to Polysulfone membrane pores As the consequence of particles attachments to the membrane, the particles begun to accumulate and, as such, contributed to the cake layer formation, shown in Figure 5.10. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous Polysulfone membranes retained some clean pores after ultrafiltration, despite the other pores being completely blocked with latex particles as shown in Figure 5.11. These clean pores allowed small particles to penetrate as represented with Particles 1, 2 in Figure 3.5 (zero rejection).

67

Figure 5.10: SEM image of latex particles contributing to the cake layer formation on Polysulfone membrane

Figure 5.11: SEM image of clean pores in Polysulfone membrane after ultrafiltration Arguably, particles had a higher chance for particle-to-membrane collision and attachment with heterogeneous membranes, due to the presence of multilayer within the membrane tissues. Figure 5.12 illustrates the attachments of some small particles that have passed the first layer of the membrane and then settled on the membrane tissue. For that reason, the pore size distribution was solely determined based on the real dark pores in the SEM image obtained using the software. In fact, the particles attached to the membrane surface (non-zero rejection) have contributed to the cake layer and the hydraulically irreversible fouling after backwash.

68

. Figure 5.12: SEM image of particles attached to Polysulfone membrane surface 5.2.2.2.Validation of the mathematical model using monodisperse particles The monodisperse particles (50 and 100 mm) at low concentration ranging from 0.090.107 kg/m3 were used to validate this model. Ultrafiltration process was performed under a constant feed flow rate and a constant time of 60 minutes using Polysulfone membrane. It was observed that the particles contributed only to the pore blocking, due to the low concentration of the monodisperse particles. Table 5.4 represents a precise agreement between the predicted increase in the transmembrane pressure and the experimental one at various operating conditions. During the model validation, the pressure sensor readings were used with the accuracy of ± 0.25%. The increase in the transmembrane pressure P  was calculated using Equation 3.65. The error was ±3.4 - 8 % and ±3.3 - 10 %, using 0.05 and 0.1 µm monodisperse particles, respectively. The experimental data for the masses of fouling or the volumetric permeate fluxes using 0.05 and 0.1 µm had an insignificant difference. This could be attributed to the fact that the heterogeneous membrane had a wide range of pore size distribution. Hence, monodisperse particles contributed as large particles for some small pores, smaller particles for some large pores, and as tiny particles for other pores in the membrane. As a consequence, the monodisperse particles (with a single particle size) allowed us to validate every aspect of the model individually and thus ensure reliability and accuracy of the model. Figure 5.13 (a) presents the SEM images of polysulfone membrane surface after the ultrafiltration process using the monodisperse particles of 0.05 µm. The monodisperse particles with a single particle size have contributed to pore blocking, since the pore sizes are similar or are of smaller than particle size. On the other hand, monodisperse particles are considered to be a smaller particles when the pore sizes are larger than the particle size. As a result, the particles had the chance to go through the 69

clean pores, or have contributed to pore blocking with particle-to-particle attachment featuring one or more particle as aggregation. In addition, the monodisperse particles get attached to the wall of the pore when the particle radius is estimated to be less than the pore diameter/6. Moreover, monodisperse particles attached to the membrane surface contribute to the cake formation. Figure 5.13 (b) illustrates that the particles got settled and attached to the internal membrane pores, while the cake layer had an insignificant increase in thickness due to the low concentration. In order to have a clear comparison of the single size particle attachment mechanisms between the homogenous (i.e., uniform pore size distribution) and the heterogeneous membranes (i.e., non-uniform pore size distribution) an ultrafiltration process of mondisperse particles of 0.05 µm using polycarbonate with uniform pore size of 0.05 µm was performed. Figure 5.13 (c) illustrates that the single size particles only contributed in pore blocking or cake formation.

Validation of the mathematical model using simulated latex effluent The fouling attachment probabilities were calculated based on several particle size ranges classified in accordance with the pore size distribution of the membrane. Latex particle distribution had a range of 0.03 to 800 µm and was applied to each pore size  (  to N). For each range of particle sizes, the average particle size was used for the calculation of the projected area of the particles on the membrane surface. Eventually, the percentage of each average pore size was used in the model calculations. Table 5.5 shows the experimental results of the total mass of the particles retained by Polysulfone membrane, the mass of the particles contributing to pore blocking, the mass of the particles contributing to the cake layer, the volumetric permeate flux, and the increase in the transmembrane pressure obtained at different operational conditions. Time was kept constant (25 minutes) for all experimental runs in order to accurately determine the influence of the operating conditions on the amount of particles retained by the membrane, the permeate flux, and the fouling attachment probabilities. The transmembrane pressures predicted from the mathematical models using latex effluent were within ±9.7-12.4 % error of the experimental values for the polysulfone membrane. This might be occurring due to the fact that in the present study, membrane fouling was treated as an interaction between suspended particles with a wide range of particle size distribution and membranes featuring non-uniform pore size distribution. Notably, the estimated values appear to be always greater than the experimental values. This may be attributed to the complexity of the model calculations and its predisposition to treat each particle size with each pore size, a dynamic that may be executed somewhat differently during the modeling, from the

71

real fouling phenomenon. The mass of fouling contributing to the pore blocking (mp) was representing 67 % more than the mass of fouling contributed to cake formations in all experiments. This is due to the nature of the non-uniform pore size Polysulfone membrane, which allows the particles to be settled deep inside the pores' tissue.

The results obtained in Table 5.5 indicate that an increase in transmembrane pressure from 15 to 35 psi leads to an increase in the particle-to-particle (pp) and the particle-tomembrane (pm) attachment probabilities, from 0.54 to 0.82 and 0.67 to 0.91, respectively. Higher fouling attachment probabilities resulted in an increase in the total mass of fouling from 0.2554 kg/m2 to 0.3987 kg/m2. This contributed to a higher pressure that caused an increase in the permeate flow through the membrane which brought more particles to the membrane's surface. Hence, the chances for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment were increased, effectively causing higher attachment probabilities. Moreover, it was observed that the depositional attachment probability pm had higher values than the coagulation attachment probability pp. This indicates that the transmembrane pressure might have more impact on the pore blocking and the membrane-to-particle attachment than the cake layer build up. A substantial reduction in particle-to-particle attachment probability (pp) was expected with a higher flow rate (4 LPM), due to the greater shear rate applied on the particles at the cake layer. Nevertheless, particle-to-particle attachment probability (pp) had an insignificant reduction from 0.83 to 0.78 at 1 LPM and 4 LPM, respectively. Arguably, this is due to the nature of the heterogeneous membrane, which results in more particles attaching to each other inside the membrane matrix and trapped deeply within it. On the other hand, at a higher flow rate, the cumulative permeate flux (Vs) had a noticeable increase from 0.00636 to 0.01143 m3/m2. 72

For backwashing flow rates of 2-4 LPM, the model prediction of the mass of the irreversible fouling agreed with the total solid of irreversible fouling experimentally measured within ±7-8.5 % error while the increase in transmembrane pressure predicted from the model agreed with the experimental values within ±10.1-12.8 % error. Figure 5.14 represents SEM images of Polysulfone membrane after the backwash at a flow rate of 3 LPM. The dark spots indicate the cleaned and opened pores after backwashing.

5.3.1. Validation of the developed attachment model for homogeneous membrane It was essential to validate the model developed for homogenous membranes, including the particle sphericity using Polycarbonate homogeneous membrane. As shown in Table 5.6, Polycarbonate membranes with the pore size of 0.1 and 0.05 µm were used for the validation at a variety of operating conditions. The obtained experimental results were compared the predicted values of the total mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure using the attachment model with and without the particle sphericity. For the transmembrane pressure using the membrane with the average pore size of 0.1 µm, the average error was between the experimental and predicted values was 6.0 % when the model did not include the sphericity of the particles. On the other hand, the error was reduced to 4.5% when the model included the spericty of the particles. Similarly, for the 0.05 µm membrane, the average error was between the experimental transmembrane pressure and predicted values was 6.9 % when the model did not include the sphericity of the particles. On the other hand, the error was reduced to 4.2% when the model included the spericty of the particles. In addition, the predicted total mass of particles agreed with the experimental mass of fouling when utilizing Polycarbonate membrane with the pore size of 0.1 µm by 11.8 %, and 8.3 % using the attachment model of fouling without and 73

with the sphericity of the particles parameters, respectively. The predicted total mass of particles agreed with the experimental mass of fouling using Polycarbonate membrane with the pore size of 0.05 µm by 11.8%, and 7.5% using the attachment model of fouling without and with the sphericity of the particles, respectively. This indicates that fouling of a homogenous membrane with uniform pore size and straight pores would be significantly affected by the shape and sphericity of the particles.

5.3.2. Validation of the developed attachment model for heterogeneous membrane As showcased in Table 5.7, the Polysulfone membrane was used to validate the attachment model for heterogeneous membranes, including the respective sphericity values at different operating conditions. The attachment model prediction for the increase in transmembrane pressure corresponds with the experimental results, with the average errors of 10.0 % and 9.9 %, when the model excluded and included the sphericity of the particles, respectively. In addition, the predicted total mass of particles agreed with the experimental data for Polysulfone membranes by 10.2 %, and 10.4 %, using the attachment model of fouling without and with the particle sphericity, respectively. This can be attributed to the nature of nonuniform pore size membranes. Furthermore, the pores of Polysulfone membranes are not aligned straight. As a consequence, the particles sphericity was ineffective in the model based on heterogeneous membranes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the spericity of the particles had a significant effect only on the homogenous attachment model.

Effect of operating conditions on fouling attachments, cake layer, cumulative permeate flux, and specific power consumption One of the objectives of the present study was to investigate the impact of operating

conditions on fouling attachment probabilities, the total mass of fouling, the cake height, the cumulative permeate volume, and the specific power consumption. Results obtained show that the transmembrane pressure (TMP), feed flow rate and feed concentration had a significant effect on the mass of fouling, membrane performance and power consumption, as demonstrated in this section. In addition, the objective was to compare the impact of the same operating conditions on the membrane fouling using membranes with uniform and non-uniform pore sizes.

5.4.1. Using homogeneous Polycarbonate membrane 5.4.1.1. The influence of transmembrane pressure At a feed flow rate of 4.0 L/min and a feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, increasing the transmembrane pressure from 15 to 45 psi lead to increases in the particle-to-particle (pp) and the particle-to-membrane (pm) attachment potentials from 0.4 to 0.76 and 0.55 to 0.8, respectively. Higher fouling attachment probabilities resulted in an increase in the total mass of fouling from 0.0104 kg/m2 to 0.0145 kg/m2. As shown in Figure 5.15 (a), when the pressure was raised from 15 to 35 psi, the fouling attachment probabilities increased from 0.4 to 0.75 and from 0.5 to 0.8 for coagulation attachment probability (pp) and depositional attachment probability (pm), respectively. However, further increase in pressure did not affect pp and pm significantly. When the transmembrane pressure increased from 15 to 35 psi, the volumetric permeate flux and the mass of fouling increased from 0.0125 m3/m2 to 0.0178 m3/m2 and from 0.0104 kg/m2 to 0.0142 kg/m2, respectively. Higher permeate flow through the membrane brought more particles 75

to the membrane's surface. Hence, chances for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment have increased , resulting in a higher attachment probabilities. Notably, increasing the pressure from 35 to 45 psi resulted in an insignificant change in the volumetric permeate flux ( Vs ) from 0.0178 m3/m2 to 0.0179 m3/m2. The reason for the minimal increase lies in the fact that the transmembrane pressure higher than the critical pressure has an insignificant effect on the permeate flux or the total mass of fouling retained by the membrane. Thus, the fouling attachments probabilities values leveled off to a relatively constant value. Moreover, Figure 5.15 shows that the depositional attachment probability pm had higher values than the coagulation attachment probability pp. This indicates that the transmembrane pressure might have more impact on the pore blocking and the membrane-to-particle attachment than the cake layer build up. Higher fouling attachment probabilities resulted in an increase in the total mass of fouling from 0.0104 kg/m2 to 0.0145 kg/m2 as shown in Figure 5.15 (b). The specific power consumption also increased from 10.17 to 21.02 kWh/m3. The error bars presented in the figures of this study, represent the confidence intervals of 95 %, as calculated in Appendix (J).

Figure 5.16 presents the SEM images of the membrane after the ultrafiltration experiment at different pressures, and at a fixed feed flow rate, filtration time and feed concentration, illustrating the effect of pressure on the cake build-up. Figure 5.16 (a) was obtained from a sample at a pressure of 15 psi, showing a thick cake sample (average thickness of about 5.05 µm). Figure 5.16 (b) shows that the cake thickness increased to about 8.55 µm when the pressure was increased to 35 psi. Arguably, at the transmembrane pressure of 35 psi (critical pressure at feed flow rate 4 LPM and feed concentration 1.3 kg/m3), the concentration polarization might attain a sufficient level for the retained solutes at the membrane surface to reach the gel concentration. Once a gel layer has formed, further increase in the applied pressure does not lead to the increase in the volumetric permeate flux above the one attained at critical pressure value. However, higher pressure causes the formed cake layer on membrane surface to be compressed. As shown in Figure 5.17 the cake layer becomes compressed to 7.9 µm at 45 psi.

5.4.1.2. The influence of feed flow rate Figure 5.18 depicts the effect of the feed flow rate on the fouling attachments, cumulative permeate flux, total mass of fouling, and the specific power consumption at 15 psi and feed concentration at 1.3 kg/m3. It was observed that the particle-to-particle attachment probability (pp) was significantly reduced from 0.86 at 1 LPM (cross flow velocity of 10.4cm/s) to 0.19 at 6 LPM (cross flow velocity of 62.5 cm/s), while the particle-to-membrane attachment probability (pm) decreased from 0.82 to 0.49. The probable cause for this substantial reduction in pp with the feed flow rate is that at a higher flow rate, a higher shear rate is applied on the particles at the cake layer. Consequently, a higher number of particles were washed away from the cake layer. In particular, as the feed flow rate was increased to 3.0 LPM, there was a stiff decrease in pp, which , arguably, marks the critical flow rate for membrane fouling in this system. On the other hand, at higher flow rate, the cumulative permeate flux ( Vs ) increased from 0.0076 to 0.014 m3/m2. As a result, more particles were brought into contact with the membrane, leading to an increase in collisions and attachments between particles and membrane surface. Consequently, pm decreased at a lower rate as compared with that of pp. As shown in Figure 5.18 (a), pp and pm approach maximum values at flow rate less than 1.0 LPM. It was also observed that as the fouling attachment probabilities decreased, the mass of particles retained by the membrane dropped from 0.0162 kg/m2 at a feed low rate of 1 LPM to 0.00838 kg/m2 at 6 LPM. Particles accumulated on the membrane surface would be washed back to the bulk fluid more at higher flow rates; and thus, the concentration polarization effect diminished. This, in turn, caused the osmotic pressure to decrease, permeation flux to increase, and the solid retained and cake height to decrease. Due to the reduction of the total mass of fouling by increasing the feed flow rate from 1 to 6 LPM, the transmembrane pressure over the duration of the filtration process only increased by 1 psi, compared to an increase of 5 psi at 1 LPM. Although the total mass of fouling was decreased, with the increase in the flow rate from 1 to 6 LPM, the power consumption per unit volume increased from 4.47 to 13.1 kW.h/m3 as illustrated in Figure 5.18 (b). This aligned with the specific power consumption as directly proportional to the feed flow rate in Equation (4). Specifically, this indicates that the increasing of the flow rate 6 times results in a 3 times increasing of the power consumption. This, in turn, implies that the remediation of the fouling is greatly required to reduce the total mass of fouling in lower flow rates, increase the

78

volumetric permeate flux, and, at the same time, reduce the power consumption per unit volume of filtrate.

Figure 5.19 (a) was obtained from a sample at a feed flow rate of 1.0 L/min, showing the cake thickness of about 13.8 µm. Figure 5.19 (b) shows that the cake thickness decreased to about 2.4 µm at the feed flow rate of 6.0 L/min. The cross-flow of the feed can be considered as a continuous washing of the cake layer, and hence, the resultant particle-to-particle attachment (pp) decreased from 0.86 at 1 LPM to 0.19 at 6 LPM.

5.4.1.3. The influence of feed concentration

Figure 5.20 shows the effect of the feed concentration on the fouling attachment probabilities, cumulative permeate flux, total mass of fouling and the specific power consumption at a feed flow rate of 1 L/min and 15 psi. Increasing the feed concentration from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3 resulted in a significant increase in the coagulation attachment probability, pp, and a significant decrease in the depositional attachment probability, pm. The particle-to-particle attachment, pp, increased from 0.3 to 0.9, while the particle-to-membrane attachment, pm, decreased from 0.95 to 0.6. Increasing the feed concentration resulted in a higher chance of particle-to-particle collision and attachment. As a consequence, the coagulation attachment probability and cake layer build up are enhanced. It was also observed that the total mass of fouling was increased from 0.0088 kg/m2 to 0.0133 kg/m2 when the concentration increased from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3, as expected. On the other hand, increasing the feed concentration lead to decreases in the volumetric permeate flux ( Vs ) from 0.011 m3/m2 to 0.007 m3/m2. A reduced permeate flow through the membrane pores resulting in a lower chance of particle-to-membrane collision and attachment. The depositional attachment probability, pm, thus decreased from 0.95 to 0.6. Moreover, as Figure 5.21 illustrates, the feed concentration had a significant effect on the cake layer thickness. The cake thickness increased from 4.3 µm to 18.5µm when the feed concentration was increased from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the particle-to-particle attachment probability (pp) was the predominant factor responsible for the cake formation, even though the particle-to-membrane attachment (pm) was decreased with the increase in the feed concentration. Figure 5.20 (b) indicates that the total mass of fouling increased from 0.0088 kg/m2 to 0.0188 kg/m2 when the concentration wasincreased from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3, as expected.Consequently, increase in transmembrane pressure over the duration of filtration was elevated from 2 psi to 5 psi to overcome the higher resistance to the permeate flow; hence, the specific power consumption was also almost doubled from 2.8 kWh/m3 to 4.8 kWh/m3.

Using heterogeneous Polysulfone membrane 5.4.2.1.The influence of transmembrane pressure At a feed flow rate of 4.0 L/min and a feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, the increase of transmembrane pressure from 15 to 45 psi leads to an increase in the particle-to-particle (pp) and the particle-to-membrane (pm) attachment probabilities, from 0.54 to 0.82 and 0.67 to 0.91, respectively. The resulting higher fouling attachment probabilities, in turn, caused an increase in 81

the total mass of fouling from 0.011 kg/m2 to 0.018 kg/m2. The fouling attachments and the mass of fouling obtained with heterogeneous Polysulfone membranes were higher than those obtained at a similar transmembrane pressure using the homogenous Polycarbonate membranes with uniform pore size, as illustrated in Section (5.3.1.1). Arguably, particles had a higher chance for particle-to-membrane collision and attachment with Polysulfone heterogeneous membranes due to the presence of multilayers within the membrane. Thus, a higher coagulation attachment can be attributed to the fact that more particles attached to each other in the membrane matrix and trapped deeply within it. Therefore, at the same operating conditions, the total mass of fouling was higher and the permeate flux was lower in the case of heterogeneous Polysulfone membrane, in comparison to the homogenous Polycarbonate membrane. As shown in Figure 5.22 (a), when the pressure was raised from 15 to 30 psi, the fouling attachment probability (pp) and depositional attachment probability (pm) increased from 0.54 to 0.8 and from 0.67 to 0.9, respectively. However, further increase in pressure did not affect pp and pm significantly. When the transmembrane pressure increased from 15 to 30 psi, the volumetric permeate flux and the mass of fouling increased from 0.0089 m3/m2 to 0.0125 m3/m2 and from 0.011 kg/m2 to 0.016kg/m2, respectively. Higher permeate flow through the membrane brought more particles to the membrane's surface. Hence, the chances for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment increased, resulting in higher attachment probabilities. Notably, increasing the pressure from 35 to 45 psi resulted in an insignificant change in the volumetric permeate flux (Vs) from 0.01384 m3/m2to 0.01386 m3/m2. Arguably, at the transmembrane pressure of 35 psi (critical pressure at feed flow rate of 4 LPM and feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3), the concentration polarization might attain a sufficiently high level for the retained solutes at the membrane's surface to reach the gel concentration. Once a gel layer has formed, further increase in the applied pressure does not lead to the increase in the volumetric permeate flux above the one attained at the critical pressure value. As a result, the fouling attachment probability values tend to level off at a relatively constant specific value. It was also observed that the cake layer was compacted at transmembrane pressure of 45 psi, as shown in Figure 5.23 (b) , when compared to Figure 5.23 (a) which illustrating the process of ultrafiltration at transmembrane pressure of 35 psi. Notably, this corresponds with the previously demonstrated fact that the transmembrane pressure increase influences the cake and its permeability, porosity, and shape characteristics (Hamachi and Peuchot, 1999). Moreover, Figure 5.22 (a) shows that 82

the depositional attachment probability pm has higher values than the coagulation attachment probability pp. This indicates that the transmembrane pressure might have significantly more impact on the pore blocking inside the membrane matrix and the membrane-to-particle attachment than the cake layer build up. A similar observation was made in our previous work with homogenous Polycarbonate membrane. This increase in the total mass of fouling, in turn, caused an increase in the transmembrane pressure through the ultrafiltration process from 3.00 to 6.00 psi, and raised the specific power consumption from 1.59 to 3.25 kW.h/m3, as presented in Figure 5.22 (b).

A substantial decrease in particle-to-particle (pp) and particle-to-membrane (pm) attachments with increasing the flow rate was expected due to the higher shear rate to wash away the particles, as in the case of the homogenous Polycarbonate membrane discussed in Section 5.3.1.2. However, the results obtained in the present study show otherwise the increase of the feed flow rate caused a slight reduction in the particle-to-particle attachment (pp) from 0.83 at 1 LPM (cross flow velocity of 10.4 cm/s) to 0.7 at 7 LPM (cross flow velocity of 72.8 cm/s). This may be attributed to the structure of Polysulfone membrane, specifically, even at the highest flow rate of 7 LPM used in this study; the particles were still attaching to each other and contributing to the multiple cake layers inside the matrix of the membrane, as shown in Figure 5.25 (a) and Figure 5.25 (b). Figure 5.26 provides evidence of the manner in which the nature of the heterogeneous membranes allowed the foulants to be deposited inside the membrane's layers. Furthermore, higher thransmembrane pressure of 25 psi caused insignificant decrease of fouling attachments with heterogeneous Polysulfone membrane, when compared to the results obtained with a polycarbonate membrane at transmembrane of 15 psi (Section 5.3.1.2). On the other hand, at higher flow rate, the cumulative permeate flux (Vs) increased from 0.006 to 0.014 m3/m2. As a result, more particles came into contact with membrane, leading to an increase in 84

collisions and attachments between particles and the membrane's surface. Accordingly the particle-to-membrane attachment probability (pm) decreased only from 0.9 to 0.82 at 1 LPM and 7 LPM, respectively. It was observed that as the fouling attachment probabilities decreased, the mass of particles retained by the membrane dropped from 0.0195 kg/m2 at a feed low rate of 1 LPM to 0.0088 kg/m2 at 7 LPM , as shown in Figure 5.24 (b). The decrease in the total mass of fouling resulted in a smaller increase in the transmembrane pressure through the ultrafiltration duration from 7.00 to 2.00 psi. However, the power consumption per unit volume was raised from 0.85 to 3.33 kW.h/m3 as illustrated in Figure 5.24 (b). This trend agrees with Equation (4.3) where the specific power consumption is directly proportional to the feed flow rate. It is worth noting that in the case of the Polysulfone membranes it is difficult to measure the cake height accurately, due to its heterogeneous multilayered surface, as demonstrated in Figures 5.25 (b) and 5.25 (c). Figures 5.25 (a) and 5.25 (b) demonstrates that the higher shear force at 7 LPM washed away most of the particles located on the top surface while other particles were still retained deeply inside the membrane's matrix.

Increasing the feed concentration from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3 led to a significant increase in the coagulation attachment probability, pp, from 0.34 to 0.81and a slight increase in the depositional attachment probability, pm, from 0.83 to 0.89. Increasing the feed concentration resulted in a higher chance of particle-to-particle collision and the coagulation attachment probability and cake layer build up were enhanced. It was also observed that the total mass of fouling increased from 0.011 kg/m2 to 0.017 kg/m2 when the concentration was increased from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3, as anticipated. As shown in Figure 5.27 (a), particle-to-particle attachment values leveled off to a relatively constant value at the concentration of 1.3 kg/m3. At this concentration, a significant amount of particles might have been present to facilitate the maximum possible particle collision and attachment. On the other hand, increasing the feed concentration led to a decreases in the volumetric permeate flux (Vs) from 0.0142 m3/m2 to 0.00924 m3/m2. A reduced permeate flow through the membrane pores would decrease particle-to-membrane collision and attachment hence, the depositional attachment probability, pm, would decrease as observed with homogeneous Polycarbonate membranes as reported in Section 5.3.1.3. Nevertheless, the opposite trend was observed with the Polysulfone membrane used in the present study. This could be attributed to the structure of the Polysulfone membrane which allows the particles to settle inside the membrane matrix and thus facilitated more particle-to-membrane attachments 87

with increases in solid concentration. The increase of transmembrane pressure over the duration of the filtration process was also raised from 3.00 to 7.00 psi. As a consequence, the specific power consumption increased from 1.50 kW.h/m3 to 8.00 kW.h/m3, as depicted at Figure 5.27 (b). Notably, increasing the feed concentration from 1.30 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3 led a noticeable decrease in the volumetric permeate flux (Vs) from 0.0114 m3/m2 to 0.00924 m3/m2. Consequently, a more significant increase in the power consumption occurred at the concentrations above 1.30 kg/m3, as shown in Figure 5.27 (b).

conditions (25 psi transmembrane pressure, 4 LPM feed flow rate, and 25 minutes). Figure 5.28 (a), (c), (e) represents SEM image of the membrane surface after the ultrafiltration at feed concentrations of 0.78, 1.3, and 1.82 kg/m3, respectively. As shown in Figure 5.28 (a), at a low concentration some of the particles attached to the membrane pores due to the depositional attachment (pm), some of the particles aggregated due to the coagulation attachment (pp), and some pores remained clean due to the smaller particles passing through these pores unrestricted. As a result, the presence of clean pores at low feed concentration leads to a higher volumetric permeate flux of 0.0142 m3/m2 , compared with 0.00924 m3/m2 at 1.82 kg/m3. Arguably, at this concentration the particles attached to the membrane pores and settled inside the membrane matrix do not in fact contribute in the cake layer formation, as shown in Figure 5.28 (b). Increasing the feed concentration, from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.3 kg/m3, results in a considerable augmentation in the mass of particles contributing to the pore blocking, represented in Figure 5.28 (d). A further increase in the feed concentration, causes an even higher occurrence of the particle-to-particle collision and attachment. As a consequence, the coagulation attachment probability and cake layer build-up are enhanced. For instance, at a feed concentration of 1.82 kg/m3, the particle-to-particle attachment (pp) increased to 0.8, and hence, the resulting mass of particles contributing to the cake formation (mc) increased to 0.101 g. Consequently, the cake height increased, as illustrated in Figure 5.28 (f), if compared to the cake height in Figure 5.28 (d). It was also observed that the total mass of fouling was increased from 0.011 kg/m2 to 0.017 kg/m2 when the concentration increased from 0.78 kg/m3 to 1.82 kg/m3, in accordance with the estimation. Figure 5.28 shows that the mass of fouling contributing to the pore blocking is much higher than the mass of fouling contributing to the cake layer. The cause for this resides in the polysulfone membranes characterized by multi layers of tissues with non-uniform pore size distribution.

Effect of membrane pore size distribution on the ultrafiltration performance The collected water from the permeate had an average turbidity of 125 NTU for the ultrafiltration of latex solution with a poylsufone membrane including a wide range of pore size distribution, which results in the small particles (less than the pore size) to pass through the 90

pores. The particle size distribution of the permeate was measured in order to evaluate the ultrafiltration performance using heterogeneous membranes. It was determined that the latex particles up to the range of 7.58 µm could pass through the membrane during the filtration process. This was caused by the presence of different pore sizes up to 8.782 µm, as presented in Figure 4.10. Figure 5.29 depicts the particle size distribution of the permeate after the ultrafiltration of latex solution, at the feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3 and the feed flow rate of 4 LPM at various levels of transmembrane pressure. The particle size distribution of the latex in the permeate showed a higher percentage of particles at the transmembrane pressure of 35 psi, if compared to the percentage of particles present in the permeate at the transmembrane pressure of 15 psi. This can be attributed to the fact that the higher transmembrane pressure forced the smaller particles to go through the membrane pores.

Figure 5.29: Particle Size distribution of the permeate after the ultrafiltration of latex solution [Cf = 1.3 kg/m3, and Q = 4 LPM] at different transmembrane pressure. The cellulose acetate membrane with a MWCO of 20,000 demonstrates a high performance ultrafiltration process, which results in a clear water with turbidity of zero. The reason is 80 % of the pore size distribution of cellulose acetate membrane is 0.01 microns. Arguably, all heterogeneous membranes with small MWCO values, such as the one present in the cellulose acetate membranes, would show similar performance of the ultrafiltration process as the homogenous polycarbonate membranes of homogenous pore size at different operating conditions. On the other hand, the performance of the ultrafiltration process using ultrafilic and PVDF membranes with MWCO of 100,000 depends on the membrane pressure used. At a transmembrane pressure of 15psi, the ultrafiltration process showed the highest performance quality using the ultrafilic and PVDF membranes. However, at a higher transmembrane pressure of 25 and 35psi, the water collected from the permeate using the ultrafilic membrane had an 91

average turbidity of 90 and 191 NTU, respectively. Meanwhile, the turbidity of the permeate using the PVDF was 125 and 184 NTU at a transmembrane pressure of 25 and 35 psi, respectively. These membranes included a wide range of pore size distribution, which resulted in the small particles (less than the pore size) passing unrestricted through the pores. The particle size distribution of the permeate was measured in order to accurately evaluate the ultrafiltration performance using the non-uniform pore size membranes with MWCO of 100,000. It was determined that the latex particles, up to the range of 15.13 and 17.37 µm, could in fact pass through the membrane during the filtration process implementing the ultrafilic and PVDF membranes, with the respective ranges. This was caused by the presence of different pore sizes, up to the range of 15.49 and 18.425 µm, in the ultrafilic and PVDF membranes respectively. Figure 5.30 depicts the particle size distribution of the permeate after the ultrafiltration of the latex solution using both of these membranes, at the feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, and the feed flow rate of 4 LPM at different transmembrane pressure levels. The particle size distribution of the latex in the permeate showed a higher percentage of particles present in the permeate at the transmembrane pressure of 35 psi, in comparison to the percentage of particles at the transmembrane pressure of 25 psi. Admittedly, this could be attributed to the fact that the higher transmembrane pressure forced the smaller particles to pass through the membrane's pores unobstructed.

Effect of the zeta potential of membrane surface on membrane fouling The effect of the zeta potential of the membrane surface on fouling attachments, the total

mass of fouling, permeate flux , and specific power concerns was investigated. Under the operating conditions of 25 psi, 4.5 LPM , 1.3 kg/m3, and after increasing the zeta potential of the membrane surface, the surface charge became increasingly negative, from -10.00 to -50.00 mV (5 times), resulted in reduction of depositional attachment (pm) by 65%, from 0.99 to 0.35, as shown in Figure 5.31 (a). This could be attributed to the increased hydrophilicity of the

membrane, which was created upon introducing more negative charges on the membrane surface; hence, the electrostatic attraction force between the latex particles and the membrane surface was significantly decreased. The zeta potential of latex particles at pH of 7 is approximately -26.61 mV. The particle-to-membrane attachment was thus significantly reduced because the repulsion forces between latex particles and the higher negativity membrane surface increased. On the other hand, increasing the zeta potential negativity of the membrane surface 5 times resulted in an insignificant decrease of the coagulation attachment (pp) by 5.3% from 0.75 to 0.71, as shown in Figure 5.31 (a). The decrease in the depositional attachment (pm) caused a significant increase in the cumulative filtration volume per unit area from 0.015 to 0.123 m3/m2, an augmentation of about10 times, as shown in Figure 5.31 (b). This could be attributed to the significant reduction in the depositional attachment that resulted in less particle attachment to the membrane pores, i.e. less pore blockage to the filtrate passage through the membrane. Moreover, as a consequence of the depositional attachment reduction , the total mass of fouling diminished by 61%, from 0.018 to 0.007 kg/m2, as illustrated in Figure 5.31 (c). Decreasing the total mass of fouling resulted in a lower rate of the transmembrane pressure increase during the filtration process. Accordingly, the specific power consumption was noticeably decreased by 92.5 %, from 24.83 to 1.86 kW.h/m3, as presented in Figure 5.31 (d). From these observations a conclusion can be drawn that the depositional attachment is the predominant factor in membrane fouling. In addition, altering the particle-to-membrane attachment (pm) by manipulating the zeta potential of the membrane surface could be an essential process in fouling remediation.

Alternatively, Figure 5.32 (b) presents an SEM image of Polysulfone membrane with the zeta potential of -10.00 mV after ultrafiltration at the same operating conditions. In SEM images, the white latex particles blocked the membrane pores and deposited between membrane fiber. As shown in Figure 5.32 (a), the lower depositional attachment caused a decrease in the total mass of fouling, due to the reduced chances for particles to participate in particle-to-membrane attachment.

It was likewise critical to investigate the effects of increasing the membrane hydrophilicity of different heterogeneous membranes other than Polysulfone. For this reason, the effect of the zeta potential of the Ultrafilic membrane surface on membrane fouling was investigated at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, a feed flow rate of 4 LPM, and a feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, as presented in Table 5.8. Reducing the negativity of the surface charge of Ultrafilic membrane from the original zeta potential value of -41.50 mV to -30.00 mV resulted in a decreased repulsion force between the membrane surface and latex particles, which in turn caused the depositional attachment (pm) to increase from 0.70 to 0.85. Higher pm led to more particle attachment to the membrane surface, resulting in a higher pore blockage, a decrease in the cumulative filtration volume per unit area from 0.123 to 0.115 m3/m2, an increase in the mass of fouling from 0.025 to 0.03 kg/m2, and the power consumption escalation from 1.82 to 1.93 kW.h/m3. Further decrease in the surface negativity from -30.00 mV to -15.00 mV, caused a further increase in the depositional attachment from 0.85 to 0.96. Consequently, the cumulative filtration volume per unit area decreased from 0.115 to 0.03 m3/m2, while the mass of fouling increased from 0.03 to 0.05 kg/m2. Raising the total mass of fouling caused the increase in the transmembrane pressure to raise at a higher rate through the filtration process, and this allowed the power consumption to increase from 1.93 to 7.5 kW.h/m3. It should be noted that the coagulation attachment (pp) was 0.76, 0.76, and 0.77 using Ultrafilic membranes with the zeta potentials of -41.50 mV, -30.00 mV , and -15.00 mV, respectively. Figure 5.33 (a), Figure 5.33 (b), and Figure 5.33 (c) showcase the SEM images for Ultrafilic membrane after ultrafiltration at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, a feed flow rate of 4 LPM, and a feed concentration of 1.3 95

kg/m3, at the zeta potentials of -41.50 mV, -30.00 mV, and -15.00 mV, respectively. Figure 5.33 (b) illustrates that decreasing the negativity of the surface charge of Ultrafilic membrane resulted in a smaller number of clean pores, greater number of particle attachments to the membrane surface, and a higher chance of particle-to-particle collisions and attachments, if compared to Figure 5.33 (a). A further decrease in the surface negativity caused extensive particle deposition on the membrane surface, and thus an even higher chance for the particles to contribute to the coagulation attachment and cake formation, as shown in Figure 5.33 (c).

For Polysulfone membrane, the difference between the effect of raising the feed flow rate and the effect of increasing the zeta potential of membrane surface on membrane fouling was also investigated. At a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, a feed concentration of 1. 3 kg/m 3, and a zeta potential of -20.00 mV, increasing the feed flow rate from 4.5 LPM to 7 LPM resulted in a 96

reduced coagulation attachment from 0.75 to 0.55. At the higher flow rate, the cross-flow of the feed can be considered as a continuous washing of the cake layer, causing a decrease in particleto-particle attachment (pp). Figure 5.34 (b) indicates a lower cake height at a cross flow velocity of 72.8 cm/s (7 LPM), if compared to Figure 5.34 (a) at a cross flow velocity of 46.8 cm/s (4.5 LPM). It is worth noting that in the case of the Polysulfone membranes it is difficult to measure the cake height accurately due to its heterogeneous multilayered surface. Increasing the feed flow rate resulted in a 41.2% reduction in the total mass of fouling from 0.017 kg/m 2 to 0.01 kg/m2, owing only to the diminishing of the cake layer. As the depositional attachment (pm) only decreased from 0.94 to 0.89, due to the accumulation of particles trapped inside the membrane tissue, which contributed to the multiple cake layers inside the matrix of the membrane. Moreover, Increasing the feed flow rate caused an increase in the cumulative filtration volume per unit area from 0.02 to 0.025 m3/m2 (25%). Despite the fact that the total mass of fouling was decreased by 41.2%, thus reduction in transmembrane pressure through the ultrafiltration process from 6.5 to 4 psi, the power consumption per unit volume still increased by 21.7% from 12.5 kW.h/m3 to 15.2 kW.h/m3. An analysis of these relationships suggests that there is an alignment with the specific power consumption as it is directly proportional to the feed flow rate from the Equation (4.3). This proportional correlation entails that the remediation of the fouling is necessary for the reduction of the total mass of fouling in lower flow rates, increase of the cumulative filtration volume per unit area, and a reduction of the power consumption per unit volume of filtrate. On the other hand, at the transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, and feed flow rate of 4.5 LPM, increasing the surface zeta potential from -20.00 mV to 50.00 mV resulted in a lesser attraction force between the particles and the membrane surface. This caused the depositional attachment (pm) to noticeably decrease by 62.76%, from 0.94 to 0.35, leading to a smaller number of particles trapped inside the matrix, as presented in Figure 5.34 (c). The cumulative filtration volume per unit area escalated more than 5 times from 0.02 m3/m2 to 0.123 m3/m2, and the total mass of fouling decreased by 58.8 %, from 0.017 kg/m2 to 0.007 kg/m2. Decreasing the total mass of fouling resulted in a lower increment in the

transmembrane pressure through the ultrafiltration process from 6.5 to 1.5 psi. Accordingly, the specific power consumption was significantly reduced by 85.1 %, from 12.5 kW.h/m 3 to 1.8 kW.h/m3. The coagulation attachment probability had only slightly lessened from 0.75 to 0.72. 97

Due to a smaller number of particles attached to the membrane surface, chances of collision and attachment of particles on the membrane surface with other particles would be lower, as shown in Figure 5.34 (c).

Statistical analysis for model development The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to design experiments that

provided sufficient data to establish correlations for the prediction of the attachment fouling probabilities at a given operational condition. These correlations can be then used by our previous mathematical model to make a complete set of predictive models. The predicted fouling attachment probabilities from the correlations could be used to calculate the total mass of fouling retained by the membrane, irreversible fouling after backwash, increase in transmembrane pressure through the filtration process, and the increase in transmembrane pressure due to irreversible fouling. 5.7.1. Fouling Attachments models using homogeneous Polycarbonate membranes The process parameters include transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, and feed concentration. In this study, the Central Composite Face-Centered CCF Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the experimental design method. Twenty experiments were performed and the fouling attachment probabilities (pp and pm) were calculated for each experimental run, as shown in Table 5.9. The results were analyzed using multi-regression so as to identify the effects of the process parameters on the membrane fouling in ultrafiltration 98

of a latex solution. Moreover, the process parameters were examined in order to identify the optimum conditions that would allow for the minimum fouling attachment probabilities. The analysis of the results indicated that the fouling attachment probabilities directly depend on the operating conditions being implemented. Depositional attachment probability pm and the coagulation fouling probabilities pp vary between the ranges of 0.3 to 0.98 and 0.15 to 0.95, respectively. The mean value of the depositional attachment probability is 0.67, while the mean value of the coagulation attachment probability is 0.58.

Based on the ANOVA analysis, quadratic and linear models best fitted the experimental data for pp and pm. The models for pm and pp are given in Equation (5.1) and Equation (5.2), respectively. Equations (5.1a) & (5.2a) are used to predict the fouling attachments using the feed flow rate, while Equations (5.1b) & (5.2b) are used to predict the fouling attachments using the cross flow velocity. In addition, the goodness of fit was determined by evaluating the coefficients of determination (R2). R2 was 96 % for the quadratic and linear models. In fact, R2 of 96 % indicated that the models can adequately predict the relationships between the selected parameters. pm = 1.014+ 0.008 ×A - 0.051 × B - 0.25962× C pm = 1.014+ 0.008 ×A - 0.0049 × D - 0.25962× C pp = - 0.94833 + 0.043034×A - 0.000606061×B + 1.21732×C + 0.00125 ×A× B - 0.00240385×A×C - 0.05609 × B×C -0.000668182×A2 - 0.000757576 ×B2 - 0.22862 ×C2 pp = - 0.94833 + 0.043034×A - 5.82× 10-5 ×D + 1.21732×C + 0.00012 ×A× D - 0.00240385×A×C - 0.0054 × D×C -0.000668182×A2 - 6.97× 10-6 ×D2 - 0.22862 ×C2 (Equation 5.2b) (Equation 5.2a) (Equation 5.1a) (Equation 5.1b)

where fouling attachment probabilities are functions of transmembrane pressure (A) [psia], feed flow rate (B) [LPM],cross flow velocity (D) [cm/s], and feed concentration (C) [kg/m3]. A positive sign implies that increasing the factor improves the effect and vice versa. The sign of the quadratic term coefficient indicates that the curve is concave downward when it has a negative sign and concave upward when it has a positive sign. To assess their validity the generated results were then analyzed by the ANOVA as presented in Table 5.10. The p-value is the probability value used to set the level of confidence for the F-test and to ascertain the significance of each of the coefficients. The p-value should be less than or equal to 0.05 to be significant (Calatayud et al., 2010; Yuliwati et al., 2012). According to regression coefficients and probability values (P-value) shown in Table 5.8, the linear terms were all functionally significant for both fouling attachment probabilities. Thus, it can be concluded from Equation (5.1a) that in order to minimize the depositional attachment probability (pm) the pressure should be decreased while the feed flow rate and feed concentration should be increased. The 100

interactions of the transmembrane pressure­feed flow rate (AB) and the feed flow rate­feed concentration (BC) are also significant for particle-to-particle attachment (pp). Indeed, higher particle-to-particle attachment was achieved at higher transmembrane pressure­feed flow rate interaction (AB). On the other hand, at higher feed flow rate­feed concentration interaction (BC) the coagulation attachment was decreased.

Values of "p-value" less than 0.05 indicate model terms are significant. In this case of pp: A, B, C, AB, BC, A2, C2 are significant model terms. In the case of pm: A, B, C are significant model terms.

Fouling attachment probabilities estimated from the generated models in Equation 5.1a & 5.2a were then compared to the actual values of attachment probabilites (pp and pm ). This validation to ascertain the reliability and accuracy of the generated models at a range of process parameters. The actual values of fouling attachemnt probabilities calculated from Equations 3.43 & 3.44 using the exprimental values of mc & mp for each ultrafiltration run same operating conditions. Figure 5.35 indicates a good agreement of the values of attachemnt probabilities (pp and pm) predicted from the correlations (Equations 5.1a and 5.2a) and the actual values

estimated from the mechanistic model and experimental data.

In these experiments, the fouling attachment probabilities pp and pm were calculated using Equations (3.43) and (3.44) and then compared to pp and pm predicted using Equations (5.1a) and (5.2a). Table (5.11) presents a good agreement between fouling attachments predicted from regression correlations with actual values at different operating conditions.

The process parameters were then analyzed to identify the optimum conditions for a minimum fouling probability within the range of process parameters implemented in this study. For the depositional attachment pm, the minimum value achieved is 0.2961 at 16.32 psi, 6.88 LPM and 1.78 kg/m3. The minimum value of 0.134 for particle-to-particle attachment (coagulation potential) was achieved at 15.33 psi, 6.87 LPM and 0.8 kg/m3. These optimal conditions indicated that the minimum response of both fouling attachment probabilities could be obtained at the minimum transmembrane pressure, medium feed concentration, and maximum feed flow rate of the range of process parameters used in the present study. 5.7.2. Power consumption model for homogeneous Polycarbonate membranes Table 5.10 presents coded and actual levels of the process parameters. The coded values are designated as -1 (low), 0 (medium), and 1 (high). Central Composite Face-Centred CCF Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the experimental design method. The total mass of fouling was measured for each experimental run, and the specific power consumption was calculated, as shown in Table 5.12 using Equation 4.3. The total mass of fouling and the power consumed per unit volume of permeate varied in the ranges of 0.0048 to 0.024 kg/m2 and 2.81 to 37.97 kWh/m3, respectively.

The results were analyzed using multi-regression so as to identify the effects of the process parameters on the total mass of fouling and the specific power consumption in ultrafiltration of a latex solution. Moreover, the process parameters were examined in order to identify the optimum conditions that would allow for the minimum mass of fouling and power consumption. Based on the ANOVA analysis, linear models best fitted the experimental data for the total mass of fouling and the specific power consumption. The ANOVA result is presented in Table 5.13. The p-value is the probability value used to set the level of confidence for the F-test and to ascertain the significance of each of the coefficients. According to regression coefficients and probability values (p-value), as shown in Table (5.13), the linear terms were all functionally significant for the total mass of fouling and the specific power consumption. The models for the total mass of fouling and the specific power consumption are given in Equation (5.3) and Equation (5.4), respectively. In addition, the goodness of fit was determined by evaluating the coefficients of determination (R2). R2 was 0.97 for the linear models.

The linear models were compatible with the results. As illustrated in Equation (5.3a), in order to minimize the total mass of fouling, the transmembrane pressure and feed concentration should be decreased while the feed flow rate should be increased. On the other hand, to minimize the specific power consumption, the transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate and feed concentration should be decreased. Furthermore the average transmembrane pressure TMPAVG [psi] can be estimated so as to predict the specific power consumption from Equation (5.4a) using the initial transmembrane pressure, variation of transmembrane pressure ( ) with time estimated from the mechanistic model and the filtration time.

5.7.3. Fouling attachment models using heterogeneous Polysulfone membranes In the current study, the Central Composite Face-Centered (CCF) Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the optimal experimental design method. Twenty experiments were performed and the fouling attachment probabilities (pp and pm) were calculated for each of the experimental runs, as shown in Table 5.14. For the minimization of errors, six replicated experiments at zero code for each process parameter were performed in randomized order.

Based on the ANOVA analysis, the experimental data of the fouling attachment (pp and pm) fitted the linear model well, using multi regression. The models for the depositional attachment (pm) and coagulation attachment (pp) are given in Equation (5.5) and Equation (5.6) with the coefficients of determination (R2) of 95 % and 93 %, respectively.

interactions between the operating conditions had an insignificant effect on the fouling attachment using the Polysulfone heterogeneous membrane. Recalling that the interactions between the transmembrane pressure­feed flow rate (AB) and the feed flow rate­feed concentration (BC) had a significant impact on the particle-to-particle attachment (pp) using the Polycarbonate homogenous membrane. In order to assess the validity of the model coefficients, the results were then analysed using ANOVA, as presented in Table 5.15. The p-value is the probability value used to set the level of confidence for the F-test, and to ascertain the significance of each coefficient. According to the regression coefficients and probability values (p-value) shown in Table 5.15, the linear terms were all functionally significant for both of the fouling attachment probabilities at the 95 % level of confidence. From Equations (5.5a) and (5.6a), in order to minimize the attachments probabilities (pm & pp) using the Polysulfone heterogeneous membranes, the transmembrane pressure and the feed concentration should be decreased while the feed flow rate should be increased. However, in order to minimize the depositional attachment probability (pm) in the case of the Polycarbonate homogenous membrane, the transmembrane pressure should be decreased while the feed flow rate and feed concentration should be increased. These optimized conditions indicate that the minimum value for both of the fouling attachment probabilities could be obtained at the minimum transmembrane pressure, minimum feed concentration, and maximum feed flow rate within the range of process parameters used in the present study. At a transmembrane pressure of 15 psi, feed flow rate of 7 LPM, and the feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, the particle-to-particle and the particle-to-membrane attachments approach the minimum values of 0.27 and 0.35, respectively.

5.7.3.2.Validation of the fouling attachment models with different heterogeneous membranes As part of this study, it was crucial to examine the predictive capability of the complete set of the models, the mechanistic models and the correlations for pm and pp, applied to different operating conditions, and various heterogeneous membranes of different materials and different MWCO values, so as to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the developed correlations for pm and pp. Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes with a MWCO of 100,000, and Cellulose acetate with a MWCO of 20,000, were tested for this purpose. The pore size distribution had a significant effect on the mass of fouling retained by the membrane, and the increase in transmembrane pressure, as shown in Tables 5.17 and 5.18, respectively. The cellulose acetate membrane with a MWCO of 20,000 had 0.01 microns as 80 % of the pore size distribution, which resulted in the least experimental values of the mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure. Increasing the pore size in case of Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes with MWCO of 100,000 resulted in more flow through the membrane pores. Hence, the chances for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment increased. Consequently, the mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure increased, at same operating conditions, as illustrated in Tables 5.17 and 5.18, respectively.

109

Furthermore, Tables 5.17 and 5.18 present the comparison between the predicted and the experimental values of the mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure at different operating conditions using the Ultrafilic, cellulose acetate, PVDF, and Polysulfone membranes. The fouling attachments (pm and pp) were estimated using the developed correlations in Equations (5.5a) and (5.6a). In addition to the physical properties of each membrane, these fouling attachments were then used in Equations (3.55) and (3.68) to predict the total mass of fouling retained by the membrane's surface, and in Equation (3.65) to predict the increase in transmembrane pressure.

As shown in Table 5.17, the mass of fouling measured experimentally corresponds to the mass of fouling predicted using the fouling attachments predictive models from Equations (5.5a) and (5.6a), with error range of 8.0 -12.4%, 6.7-8.1 %, and 2.2-11.1% for the Ultrafilic, cellulose acetate, and Polysulfone, respectively. Arguably, these error ranges could be caused by the 110

complexity of the model's calculation, which considers each particle size with each pore size, a dynamic that may be executed somewhat differently during the modeling, from the real fouling phenomenon. However, a high error range of 26.4-45.5% between the mass of fouling predicted using the estimated fouling attachment and the experimental value was observed in case of PVDF membrane. In terms of the increase in the transmembrane pressure, as shown in Table 5.18, the experimental values corresponded with the values predicted by Equation (3.65) using the fouling attachments predicted from Equation (5.5a) and Equation (5.6a), with the error range of ±4.7-13.8 %, ±6.0-12.0 %, and ±5.4-12.0 % for Ultrafilic , cellulose acetate, and Polysulfone, respectively. Nevertheless, a very high error range of 28.6- 45.5% was obtained with PVDF membrane. To investigate the nature of the high error, it was necessary to calculate the fouling attachments (pp and pm) from Equations (3.55) and (3.68), using mc and mp values measured experimentally, for the ultrafiltration experiments specifically using the PVDF membrane. Figure 5.37 presents the correlation between the fouling attachment estimated from Equation (5.5a) and Equation (5.6a), and the fouling attachments from Equations (3.55) and (3.68), using mc and mp values measured experimentally. Notably, the depositional attachment estimated from the predicted model (Equation (5.5a)) does not agree with the actual value, as can be seen in Figure 5.37 (a). All the estimated values are less than the actual ones, with an error range of 14.0 to 54.0 %. It is relevant to note that the zeta potential of the latex particles is approximately -26.61 mV. This would result in a lower repulsive force with the PVDF membrane, which has the zeta potential of -2.5 mV, as compared with other hydrophilic membranes with higher negative charges. The actual depositional attachments thereby were greater than the ones predicted by the model due to the much higher attraction forces between the latex particles and the membrane surface. Consequently, the experimental values for the mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure are higher than the estimated values. The depositional attachment model was obtained based on the experimental data of hydrophilic Polysulfone membrane with zeta potential of -42.4 mV. Therefore, the depositional attachment (particle-to-membrane) estimated from Equation (5.5a) can only be used for hydrophilic membranes with high negative charges. On the other hand, the coagulation attachment estimated from Equation (5.6) agrees well with the experimental values, even with the hydrophobic PVDF membrane, as shown in Figure 5.37

This indicates that the zeta potential of the membrane surface must be considered to be the predominant factor in ultrafiltation membrane fouling. As a result, it was crucial to introduce the surface charge as zeta potential () of the membrane surface into our predictive model so as to be generalized for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes.

5.7.4. Fouling attachments models using heterogeneous hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes According to the results of the Section 5.6.3, the model will not be sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the fouling potential of the latex solution using hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes. The model development is necessary for the elucidation of the underlying factors affecting membrane fouling and fouling attachments through the particle-toparticle and particle-to-membrane attachments. In the current study the Central Composite

112

Centered (CCC) Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the optimal experimental design method. A total of thirty experiments was performed and the fouling attachment probabilities (pp and pm) were calculated for each of the experimental runs, as shown in Table 5.19. The depositional attachment probability pm and the coagulation fouling probabilities (pp ) vary between the ranges of 0.35 to 0.99 and 0.22 to 0.98, respectively.

Based on the ANOVA analysis and the multi regression method, the experimental data of the fouling attachments (pp and pm) were found to accurately correspond with the linear model. Equation (5.7) and Equation (5.8) provide specific models for the depositional attachment (pm) and the coagulational attachment (pp), with the coefficients of determination (R2) of 95% and 97% , respectively. Notably, the fouling attachment using the Polysulfone heterogeneous membranes was not significantly affected by the interaction between the operating conditions. pm = + 0.22+ 0.0528×TMP [psi] - 0.0112× Q [LPM]+ 0.0804×Cf [kg/m3]+ 0.025× [mV] Equation (5.7a) 3 pm = + 0.22+ 0.0528×TMP [psi] - 0.001075 ×  [cm/s]+ 0.0804×Cf [kg/m ]+ 0.025× [mV] Equation (5.7b) pp = + 0.30 + 0.025 × TMP [psi] - 0.069×Q [LPM] + 0.082 × Cf [kg/m3]+ 1x10-7×  [mV] Equation (5.8a) pp = + 0.30 + 0.025 × TMP [psi] - 0.006622×  [cm/s] + 0.082 × Cf [kg/m3]+ 1x10-7×  [mV] Equation (5.8b) The validity of the model coefficients was determined by an ANOVA analysis of the results, as presented in Table 5.20. The p-value indicates the probability value used to set the level of confidence for the F-test, as well as, to ascertain the importance of each coefficient. According to the regression coefficients and probability values (p-value) shown in Table 5.20, the operating conditions (transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, and feed concentration) are significantly correlated to both fouling attachments. However, the charge on the membrane surface as represented by the zeta potential value was found to be only significant for the depositional fouling attachment. The zeta potential did not have a substantial effect on the coagulation attachment (particle-to particle attachment), as confirmed by the experimental data and presented in Section 5.5. On the other hand, increasing the zeta potential of the membrane surface, by lowering the negatively charged value, resulted in an increased depositional attachment. Therefore, in order to reduce membrane fouling, the zeta potential should be decreased by raising the negativity of the surface charge.

The influence of the transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, and feed concentration on the fouling attachment is shown in Table 5.19. For example, experimental runs (20 & 21) and (23 & 25) reflect the effect of the transmembrane pressure, while experimental runs (12 & 13) and (17 & 18) indicate the influence of the feed flow rate, while experimental runs (13 & 15) showcase the effects of feed concentration. Either increasing the transmembrane pressure, or raising the feed concentrations, resulted in an increase in both fouling attachments. On the other hand, an increase in the feed flow rate caused both fouling attachments to decrease. Regression coefficients in Equation 5.7a and Equation 5.8a reflect the extent of the impact of each operating condition on pm& pp (Table 5.19). The transmembrane pressure had more impact on the depositional attachment, while the feed flow rate and the feed concentration have more influence on the coagulation attachment, emphasizing and re-confirming the experimental results obtained in Section 5.3.2. Accordingly, at constant operating conditions and featuring the same membrane surface charge so as to minimize the attachment probabilities (pm& pp) using the Polysulfone heterogeneous membranes, the transmembrane pressure and the feed concentration are expected to decrease while the feed flow rate should increase. Table 5.19 (runs number 7 and 8) shows that at a transmembrane pressure of 35 psi, feed flow rate of 6 LPM, and feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, and once the surface negativity of Polysulfone membrane increased by 100% from -20.00 mV to -40.00 mV, the particle-to-particle attachment only decreased by 2.4%, from 0.82 to 0.80. Moreover, as indicated in Table 5.19 (run numbers 26 and 28), at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, feed flow rate of 4.5 LPM, feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, and once the surface negativity of Polysulfone membrane decreased by 40% from -50.00 mV to -30.00 mV, the particle -to-particle attachment was slightly raised by 115

2.8% from 0.71 to 0.73. These results suggest that the coagulation attachment is independent of the membrane hydrophilicty. The optimized conditions indicate that the minimum response for both of the fouling attachment probabilities could be obtained at the minimum transmembrane pressure, minimum feed concentration, maximum feed flow rate, and highest negative charge on the membrane surface, within the range of process parameters used in the present study. 5.7.4.1.Validation of the attachment models with different heterogeneous membranes This study intended to examine the predictive capability of a complete set of models, including the mechanistic models and the correlations for pm and pp, for a variety of operating conditions with various heterogeneous membranes featuring different materials, MWCO values, and surface charges. This analysis was conducted in order to verify the accuracy and reliability of the developed correlations for pm and pp. Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes with a MWCO of 100,000, and Cellulose acetate membranes with a MWCO of 20,000, were specifically tested for this purpose. Table 5.21 reflects the agreement between the mass of fouling measured experimentally and the value predicted from the mechanistic models using the fouling attachments estimated by the correlations for pm and pp. For Polysulfone membrane, the validation experiments were performed over a range of operating conditions rather than the ones used in the experimental design. The mass of fouling measured experimentally corresponded to the value predicted through the fouling attachment predictive models, with the error range of 2.59.1% (Run number 1 to 8) and 4.0-14.3% (Run number 9 to 11) for hydrophilic and hydrophobic PVDF membranes, respectively. Admittedly, the complexity of the model's calculation could be the responsible of this error. As the model considers each particle size with each pore size, while the real fouling phenomenon features an alternative dynamic that may be executed somewhat differently.

Note: 1. Predicted*mt was calculated using Equation (3.55) plus Equation (3.68) using the estimated fouling attachments  pm & pp from Equations (5.7a) and (5.8a). 2. The zeta potential of Polysulfone membrane was adjusted using the pH treatment, as discussed in Section (4.4.6)

As presented in Table 5.22, in the case of the increase in transmembrane pressure, the experimental values correlated with the values estimated using the fouling attachments predictive models, with error ranges of 7.5-10.0% (Run number 1 to 8), and 3.4-12.3% (Run number 9 to 11) for hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, respectively. Hence, the model prediction of the mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure agreed quite well with the experimental values for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes.

Note: Predicted* increase in the TMP was calculated using Equation (3.65) for P , using the estimated fouling attachments pm & pp from Equations (5.7a) and (6.8a).

Equation (5.7a) and Equation (5.8a) illustrate that based on the regression coefficient, of the independent variables, the transmembrane pressure had more impact on fouling attachment than the zeta potential of the membrane. However, the results obtained at the validation runs number 3 and 9, in Tables 5.21 and 5.22, suggest that the hydrophobic PVDF membrane with the zeta potential of -2.50 mV demonstrated a higher fouling capability at a lower transmembrane pressure than the hydrophilic Polysulfone membrane with the zeta potential of -42.40 mV. At the feed flow rate of 4 LPM and the feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, the total mass of fouling was 0.011 kg/m2, and 0.0125 kg/m2 after the ultrafiltration process was performed using hydrophilic Polysulfone, and hydrophobic PVDF membranes at 25 psi, and 15 psi, respectively, as shown in Figure 5.38. The specific power consumption was 14.5 kW.h/m3 for the Polysulfone membrane, and 15.4 kW.h/m3 for PVDF membranes. This could be attributed to the pore size distribution which had a significant effect on the mass of fouling retained by the membrane and caused the increase in transmembrane pressure, as shown in Table 5.21 and Table 5.22. Increasing the pore size in case of PVDF membranes with MWCO of 100,000 resulted in greater flow through the membrane pores, if compared to Polysulfone membrane of MWCO of 60,000. As a result, the chances for particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collisions and attachment increased. 118

Following the growing particle attachment, the total mass of fouling increased at a lower transmembrane pressure, as reflected by the SEM images in Figure 5.38 (b) and 5.38 (d), as compared to Figure 5.38 (a) and 5.38 (c). Moreover, the higher negative charge of Polysulfone membrane generated a higher level of repulsion between the particles and the membrane surface, and bringing about lower depositional attachment (pm) of 0.34, as compared to 0.97 for the PVDF hydrophobic membrane. On the other hand, the coagulation attachment (pp) had higher value in case of polysulfone membrane due to the impact of the higher transmembrane pressure on particle-to-particle attachment. From this a conclusion can be drawn that the pore size enhances the influence of membrane hydrophilicity more than the impact of the applied transmembrane pressure at same feed flow rate and under the same feed concentration.

Equation 5.7a presented that the zeta potential would have a stronger effect on the depositional attachment (pm) than the feed flow rate, while the feed flow rate could be considered the predominant factor in the coagulation attachment (pp) change, as presented in Equation 5.8a. Both equations generated from data with Polysulfone membrane and indeed the case for other heterogeneous membranes used in the present study. At transmembrane pressure of 15 psi and a feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, the depositional attachment using Polysulfone membrane at feed flow rate of 4 LPM was 0.82, compared to 0.98 for PVDF membrane at 7 LPM, as shown in Table 5.19 (Run 2 and 10). This can be attributed to the ultrafiltration process which is performed using a treated Polysulfone membrane with the zeta potential of -10.00 mV, and as a result, causing less attraction force between latex particles and the membrane surface, especially if compared to PVDF membrane with the original zeta potential of -2.50 mV. This indicates that at a higher feed flow rate the depositional attachment does not decrease as expected due to the influence of the membrane surface charge. Correlations such as this further confirm that the zeta potential has a greater impact on the depostitioanl attachment than the feed flow rate. On the other hand, the coagulation attachment (pp ) was found to be 0.51 and 0.3 using hydrophilic Polysulfone membrane at 4 LPM and hydrophobic PVDF membrane at 7 LPM, respectively. This indicates that the fact the feed flow rate had a significant effect on the particle-to-particle attachment, while the coagulation membrane was functioning independently of the membrane surface charge. PVDF with MWCO of 100,000 allows greater flow through the membrane pores, if compared to the Polysulfone membrane of MWCO of 60,000, which resulted in higher chances for particle collisions and attachment. Furthermore, PVDF has a hydrophobic nature with zeta potential -2.5 mV, which increases the chances for greater deposition and higher particle-to-membrane attachment, if compared to Polysulfone membrane with zeta potential of 10 MV, as shown in Table 5.21. However, the total mass of fouling was higher in the case of Polysulfone membrane than PVDF, as presented in Table 5.21. This can be attributed to the influence of feed flow rate which reduced the particle-to-particle attachment and the cake layer. The effect of hydrophilicty of different membranes materials with the same MWCO on fouling attachments, the total mass of fouling, and the increase in the transmembrane pressure was also investigated. At a transmembrane pressure of 15 psi, feed flow rate of 7 LPM, and a feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, using Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes of the same MWCO of 100,000. Due to the hydrophilicity of untreated Ultrafilic membrane with a zeta potential of 120

41.50 mV, a depositional attachment of 0.19 was obtained, compared to 0.98 with the hydrophobic PVDF membrane with a zeta potential of -2.50 mV. It is relevant to note that the coagulation attachment (particle-to-particle) was similar for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes (0.29, 0.30), as shown in Table 5.21. The experimental mass of fouling was 0.0086 kg/m2 and 0.0134 kg/m2 for Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes, respectively. The transmembrane pressure increased at a higher rate of 5 psi through the ultrafiltration process with the hydrophobic PVDF membrane due to the greater total mass of fouling, in comparison to 2 psi for the hydrophilic Ultrafilic membrane (Table 5.22). Figure 5.39 presents the SEM images of the membrane surface of Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes at different surface charges after the ultrafiltration process. The hydrophilic Ultrafilic membrane has cleaner pores and a lower total mass of fouling as shown in Figure 5.39 (b), compared to the hydrophobic PVDF membrane in Figure 5.39 (a) at same operating conditions and same MWCO.

Moreover, the experimental run number 3 which performed at low feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, and feed flow rate of 4 LPM, presented in Table 5.21&5.22 , was also performed for 15 minutes and 45 minutes to examine the reliability of the correlations obtained in this study. The results indicated that the mass of fouling predicted from the mechanistic models using the fouling attachments estimated by Equations 5 and 6 were in agreement with the measured experimentally value with the error of 11%, and 14.5% for 15 minutes, and 45 minutes, respectively. While the predicted increase in transmembrane agreed with the experimental values with the error of 12.2%, and 14.7 15 minutes, and 45 minutes, respectively.

5.7.4.2.Evaluation of the attachment models for hydrophobic heterogeneous membranes As shown in Table 5.23, for the hydrophobic PVDF membrane, the estimated mass of fouling and the increase in the transmembrane pressure using Equations 5.5a and 5.6a (attachment models excluding the zeta potential) have noticeably higher error ranges of 26.7% to 43.3% and 25.0% to 41.8%, respectively. It was attributed to the fact that the depositional attachment model was obtained from the experimental data using hydrophilic Polysulfone membrane with zeta potential of -42.40 mV. However, PVDF membrane is a hydrophobic membrane with a zeta potential of -2.50 mV, which would have a relatively higher attraction force with the latex particles with a zeta potential of -26.61 mV, as compared with other hydrophilic membranes carrying more negative charges. On the other hand, the attachment models presented in Equation 5.7a and 5.8a (including the zeta potential) yielded good agreement between predicted values and experimental data even for the PVDF hydrophobic membranes as demonstrated in Table 5.23. The mass of fouling predicted by the models developed in the present study had a significantly lower error range of 7.8 to 14.3%, as compared to the range of 26.7 to 43.3 % using Equations 5.5a and 5.6a that do not include the effect of the zeta potential of the membrane surface on fouling. Likewise, the increase in the transmembrane pressure error was found within the range of 8.9 to 12.3%, as compared to 25 to 41.8%. Hence, the depositional correlation including the zeta potential is applicable for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes.

5.7.5. Power consumption model for heterogeneous membranes Power consumption models have the potential to predict the power consumption trends, and to provide accurate predictions of the power consumption for larger-scale ultrafiltration systems. While there is a variety of power consumption data available for analysing and modelling (Jurado et al., 1994; Knops and Futselaar, 1992; Suman et al., 2012), there are no adequate predictive models for an accurate estimation of the power consumption in ultrafiltration of latex effluent using different types of heterogeneous membranes of various materials, with a variety of MWCO values at a required performance level. This could be attributed to the fact that the increase in transmembrane pressure through the filtration is dependent on the mass of fouling. As a consequence, the average transmembrane pressure through the filtration process will vary with fouling attachments and the morphological characterization of the membrane Therefore, analyses and modeling of the experimental data reported in the literature would be system specific and generally insufficient for an accurate prediction. They would also have some limitation in terms of process generalization and scale-up. Furthermore, it was determined that operation conditions, latex solution chemistry, and surface charge have a significant impact on fouling attachments, the total mass of fouling, and the cake height as demonstrated in previous publications. As a consequence, the average transmembrane pressure over a period of filtration process varies in each case. Thus, it's more accurate to predict the power consumption based on the variation of the transmembrane pressure throughout the filtration process. Therefore, the goal was to enable accurate prediction of the specific power consumption in the ultrafiltration process of simulated latex effluent using heterogeneous membranes at a given feed flow rate, initial transmembrane pressure, feed concentration, and membrane surface charge for a required cumulative permeate volume per unit area. The increase in the transmembrane pressure will be predicted based on the morphological characterization of the membrane as well as the fouling attachments. The models were validated using different types of heterogeneous membranes. The Central Composite Face-Centered (CCF) Response Surface Method (RSM) was selected as the optimal experimental design method. Within the framework of the study a total of twenty experiments was performed, and the specific power consumption was accurately calculated for each of the experimental runs, as indicated in Table 5.24. The results indicate that the specific power consumption varied between the ranges of 0.85 kW.h/m3 to 8.00 kW.h/m3.

Based on the ANOVA analysis and the multi regression method, the experimental data of specific power consumption was found to accurately correspond with the linear model. Equation (5.9) presented the numerical model with the coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.96. Notably, specific power consumption value occurring during the use of the Polysulfone heterogeneous membranes was not significantly affected by the various interactions between the operating conditions.

The average transmembrane pressure TMPAVG [psi] can be calculated using the initial transmembrane pressure, the increase of transmembrane pressure ( ) with time estimated from Equation (3.65) and filtration time. Then, it can be used to predict the specific power consumption from Equation (5.9). The increase in the transmembrane pressure can be estimated from the morphological characterization of the membrane and the fouling attachments, as indicated in Equation (3.65). The fouling attachments, in turn, can be estimated from Equation (5.7) and Equation (5.8). Regression coefficients in Equation 5.9a reflect the extent of the impact of each operating condition on the power consumption, as described in Table 5.24. The feed concentration had more effect on the power consumption than the initial transmembrane pressure and the feed flow rate, emphasizing and re-confirming the results obtained in our previous work based on the use 125

of Polycarbonate membranes with uniform pore size. Notably, the average transmembrane pressure had a significant effect on the specific power consumption, which reflects the importance of accurately predicting the increase in transmembrane pressure for various membrane properties, characterization, surface charges, and operating conditions. 5.7.5.1.Validation of the power consumption model with different heterogeneous membranes This study intended to examine the predictive capability of the specific power consumption model using the complete set of models, including the mechanistic models tracking the increase in transmembrane pressure (Equation 3.65) and the models of fouling attachments. The models were tested for a variety of operating conditions with multiple heterogeneous membranes of different materials, MWCO values, and surface charges. At the same operating condition and the same surface charge, the power consumption would vary dependent on the characteristic properties of each membrane, such as: the membrane surface porosity, the pore size distribution, the number density of membrane pores per unit membrane surface area, the thickness of the membrane, and the tortuosity of the membrane pores structure since all those parameters were included in the model for the increase in transmembrane pressure. This was further considered with respect to the particle size distribution of the simulated latex effluent. Table 5.26 reflects some level of agreement between the specific power consumption calculated based on the experimental values and the value predicted by the numerical model for the specific power consumption using the estimated fouling attachments and the increase in the transmembrane pressure. The first step in this process was to predict the depositional and coagulational attachments from Equations 5.7a and 5.8a using the initial transmembrane pressure, feed flow rate, feed concentration, and membrane surface charge values. The second step was to estimate the transmembrane pressure from Equation 3, using the predicted fouling attachment, the morphological characterization of the membrane (such as: the membrane surface porosity, the pore size distribution, the number density of membrane pores per unit membrane surface area, the thickness of the membrane, and the tortuosity of the membrane pores), the cumulative permeate volume per unit area, feed concentration, the particle's projected area, and the cake resistance values. The increase in transmembrane pressure was then in turn used to calculate the average transmembrane pressure throughout the filtration process, which finally was used to estimate the specific power consumption using Equation 5.9. As shown in Table 126

5.26 the validation experiments were performed over a range of operating conditions rather than the ones used in the original experimental design and at a different surface charge of the Polysulfone membrane. The specific power consumption calculated from Equation (4.3) using the experimental values agree fairly well with the value predicted from the numerical model, with an error range of ±6.7-18.9 % for Polysulfone membrane over varied membrane surface charges from -15.00 mV to -42.40 mV. Admittedly, the complexity of the mechanistic model could be the responsible for this error range. The mechanistic model of the increase in transmembrane pressure considers the attachments of each particle size with respect to each pore size range while the real fouling phenomenon features an alternative dynamic that may be executed somewhat differently. The model only approximates the pore size distribution ranges, but it does not reflect the exact pore size distribution. Consequently, the predicted increase in transmembrane pressure agreed with the experimental values with ±6.7 to 12.0 %. In addition, the experimental error in obtaining the experimental data would augment this deviation further to some extent since the experimental error embedded in the data that was used in the model development.

At a transmembrane pressure of 25.00 psi, a feed flow rate of 7.00 LPM, and a feed concentration of 1.30 kg/m3, Table 5.24 run 12, and Table 5.24 run 5 respectively show the results obtained using Polysulfone membranes with surface charge of -42.40 mV and -25.00 mV . The increase in transmembrane pressure was 2.00 psi and 4.00 psi in the case of Polysulfone membrane with surface charges of -42.40 mV and -25.00 mV, respectively. This was due to the higher attraction force between the latex particles and the membrane surface which caused a 127

higher depositional attachment of 0.94 for Polysulfone membrane with surface charge of -25.00 mV, as compared to 0.82 for Polysulfone membrane with surface charge of -42.40 mV. The larger depositional attachment led to a higher total mass of fouling of 0.012 kg/m2, as compared to 0.0088 kg/m2. Evidence of this effect of the surface charge on the amount of fouling can be seen in SEM images shown in Figure 5.40. Furthermore, a lower cumulative permeate volume per unit area of 0.042 m3/m2 was obtained with the Polysulfone membrane with a lower surface charge of -25.00 mV. While for the Polysulfone membrane with a hydrophilic surface (zeta potential of -42.40 mV), the cumulative permeate volume per unit area was 0.113 m3/m2. As a consequence, the specific power consumption was 3.33 kW.h/m3 and 8.89 kW.h/m3 for

Polysulfone membranes with surface charges of -42.40 mV and -25.00 mV respectively. This is expected since the cumulative permeate volume is inversely proportional to the specific power consumption, as indicated by Equation (4.3). It should be noted that the model incorporates surface charge influence on the depositional attachment in addition to the cumulative permeate volume per unit area, which makes the model predicts the power consumption accurately.

In addition, Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes with a MWCO of 100,000, and Cellulose acetate membranes with a MWCO of 20,000, were specifically tested for this purpose. Table 5.27 shows the predicted power consumption using various membranes at different operating conditions agreed with the power consumption calculated from the experimental values with an error range of 6.0 to 19.1 %. Furthermore, the predicted increase in transmembrane pressure agreed with the experimental value within the error range of 4.7 to 12.3 %.

As shown in Table 5.27, for run number 4 with Cellulose Acetate at a transmembrane pressure of 25.00 psi, feed flow rate of 4.00 LPM and feed concentration 1.30 kg/m3,the increase in transmembrane pressure was 1.50 psi while the power consumption was 5.84 kW.h/m3. At the same operating conditions with Polysulfone membrane (Table 5.22, run 15), the increase in transmembrane pressure was 5.00 psi and the specific power consumption was 2.04 kW.h/m3. Notably, the surface charge of Polysulfone and Cellulose acetate membranes are relatively close to each other at -42.40 mV and -33.90 mV, respectively. However, Cellulose acetate membranes with a MWCO of 20,000 had 80 % of the pore size distribution at 0.01 microns, as presented in Figure 5.41 (a), which resulted in the lower experimental mass of fouling and smaller increase in transmembrane pressure. Increasing the pore size in case of Polysulfone membranes with MWCO of 60,000, as shown in Figure 5.41 (b), caused more flow through the membrane pores, thus raising the chances for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment in the pores, hence, there would be more pore blocking. As a consequence, the mass of fouling and the increase in transmembrane pressure by the filtration time increased. However, the permeate volume was higher with Polysulfone membrane, resulting in a lower specific power consumption. Figure 5.42 shows the SEM images after the ultrafiltration process at a transmembrane pressure of 25.00 psi, feed flow rate of 4.00 LPM, and feed concentration of 1.30 kg/m3 using Cellulose acetate and Polysulfone membranes. Latex particles appeared to penetrate deeper inside the pores of Polysulfone membrane, as compared to the case for Cellulose acetate membrane. These results again emphasize the effects of the morphological characterization of the membrane on the specific power consumption. 129

Run 3 in Table 5.24 and run 6 in Table 5.27 show the results obtained using Polysulfone membrane and PVDF membrane at the transmembrane pressure of 15.00 psi, the feed flow rate of 7.00 LPM, and the feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3. The increase in transmembrane pressure was 0.50 psi and 4.50 psi for Polysulfone and PVDF membranes, respectively. Similarly, the specific power consumption was 1.92 kW.h/m3 and 4.36 kW.h/m3 for Polysulfone and PVDF membranes, respectively. A PVDF membrane with MWCO of 100,000 has a larger portion of larger pore sizes as compared to those for a Polysulfone membrane with MWCO of 60,000. The pore size distribution had a significant effect on the mass of fouling retained by the membrane and caused the increase in transmembrane pressure, resulting in the differences in the specific power consumption and the transmembrane pressure rise of the two membranes. Moreover, the higher negative charge of Polysulfone membranes of -42.40 mV generated a higher level of repulsion between the particles and the membrane surface, compared to PVDF membrane with surface charge of -2.50 mV. As a consequence, the depositional attachment was 0.35 and 0.92 for Polysulfone and PVDF membrane respectively. Consequently, the total mass of fouling and the average transmembrane pressure were higher for PVDF at the same operating conditions. On the other hand, while both Ultrafilica and PVDF membranes have the same MWCO of 100,000 with similar pore size distribution (Figure 5.43), the surface charge of each membrane played a critical role in the fouling attachments and the total mass of fouling, resulting in a higher increase in transmembrane pressure and lower cumulative permeate volume. For example, at the transmembrane pressure of 15.00 pisa, the feed flow rate of 7.00 LPM, and feed concentration of 1.30 kg/m3 (Table 5.27 run 3 and 7), the increase in transmembrane pressure was 2.00 psi and 5.50 psi for Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes, respectively. This can be attributed to the higher negative surface charge of -41.50 mV for Ultrafilic membranes compared to 2.50 mV for hydrophobic PVDF membrane. The depositional attachment values were thus 0.19 and 0.98 for Ultrafilic and PVDF membrane, respectively. As a consequence, the total mass of fouling was 0.014 kg/m2 for PVDF and 0.0092 kg/m2 for Ultrafilic membrane. Visual observation of the deposit on the membranes can be found in Figure 5.44. Also, the cumulative permeate volume was 0.07 m3/m2 and 0.04 m3/m2 for Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes, respectively. The specific power consumption for Ultrafilic (3.22 kW.h/m3) was lower than that of PVDF (6.08 kW.h/m3) as expected. In addition, it should be noted that the predicted

transmembrane pressure was 2.20 and 4.10 psi using Ultrafilic and PVDF, respectively. This 131

difference stems from various reasons, including the surface hydrophilic, which had a significant impact on the depositional attachment and the cumulative permeate flux, both of which

significantly affected the predicted increase in transmembrane pressure. This difference can also be linked to the fact that although both membranes have MWCO of 100,000, they have different pore size distributions, as presented in Figure 5.43, and the model considers the attachment analyses of each particle size with each pore size. As a consequence, these prediction results of the transmembrane pressure enhanced the model accuracy with the variation of the morphological characterization of each membrane. Thus the prediction of the increase in transmembrane pressure using this model is accurate and highly practical. Consequently, the model showed good agreement for heterogeneous membranes featuring different materials, MWCO values, and surface charges.

5.7.5.2.Power consumption prediction for practical use in an industrial setting Table 5.28 shows the experimental runs performed to comprehensively test and validate the ability of the complete set of the predictive models to accurately estimate the power consumption at a required cumulative permeate volume. In the previous sections, the models were validated using the cumulative permeate volume obtained experimentally. On the other hand, Table 5.28 presents the predicted power consumption based on an arbitrarily required cumulative permeate volume Vs for the untreated Polysulfone membrane with surface charge of 42.40 mV. The predicted values obtained agree with the power consumptions calculated from the experimental data of the cumulative filtrate volume within an error range of ±7.5 to 17.1 %. Likewise, the predicted increase in transmembrane pressure agrees with the experimental value with an error ranging from ±4.3 to 11.7 %. Therefore, the models can be considered as fairly accurate in predicting the membrane performance.

For the practical use in an industrial setting, the specific power consumption can be predicted for a membrane filtration process, using the operating conditions, membrane surface charge, and the morphological characterization of the heterogeneous membrane. The depositional attachment and the coagulation attachment can be estimated from Equation 5.7 and Equation 5.8. The fouling attachments in addition to the morphological characterization of the membrane can be, in turn, employed to estimate the increase in the transmembrane pressure at a required cumulative permeate volume per unit area.

Membrane Fouling remediation Following previous results, the fouling remediation can be considered critical in reducing

membrane fouling, increasing the permeate flux and reducing the power consumption per unit volume of filtrate at given operating conditions. 5.8.1. Feed pre-treatment by changing the pH of latex solution The effects of the solution pH over a range from 3-12 on particle-particle attachment and particle-membrane were investigated since those attachment potentials strongly affect the volumetric permeate flux, the total mass of fouling, and the specific power consumption. 5.8.1.1.Effect of pH on ionic strength of latex solution and membrane surface hydrophilicity of homogeneous Polycarbonate membrane The ionic strength is directly proportional to the solution conductivity. Therefore, the effect of the solution pH on the ionic strength of the solution is evaluated based on the change in the solution conductivity with pH. Figure 5.45 (a) illustrates the effect of pH on the conductivity of the latex solution. At a solid concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, the pH of the latex solution was 7. The solution conductivity increased from 0.094 to 38.8 mS/cm when the solution pH was increased from 7 to 14. On the other hand, decreasing pH from 7 to 2 using HCl and H2SO4 only resulted in a slight increase in the conductivity to 2.57 and 5.5 m S/cm, respectively. Figure 5.45 (b) depicts the zeta potential values of the latex particles and membrane surface. Zeta potential of latex particles at pH 7 is approximately -26.61 mV. For the pH values greater than 7, the zeta potential becomes more negative as the ionic strength increases. The zeta potential of latex particles achieved -42.66 mV at pH 12. The zeta potential of membrane surface is negative at all pH values investigated. As the pH is increased from 3 to 12, the zeta potential of membrane surface becomes increasingly negative from -18.11 to -46.77 mV, respectively. This indicates that the hydrophilicty of the membrane surface increased with the rise of pH value.

Under the same operating conditions, increasing the solution pH from 7 to 12 resulted in a significant reduction in the particle-toparticle attachment from 0.4 to 0.19, as shown in Figure 5.46 (a). This indicates that the ionic strength of the latex solution increased with pH, which in turn caused an increased negative charge on the latex particles due to the OH- group added to the solution. Raising the pH from 7 to 12 resulted in an increase of the zeta potential of the latex particles from -26.61 -42.66 mV, respectively. As a consequence, the electrostatic repulsive forces between the latex particles were increased, while the particle-to-particle attachment decreased significantly. Also, the depositional attachment decreased from 0.55 to 0.26. This could be attributed to the enhancement of the hydrophilicty of the membrane and the increase in the negative charge on the membrane surface with increases in the solution pH. As the pH is increased from 7 to 12, the zeta potential of the membrane surface became increasingly negative from -36.67 to -46.77 mV, respectively. Therefore, the electrostatic attraction force between latex particles and the membrane surface decreased. Consequently, the particle-to-membrane attachment was significantly reduced. The noticeable reduction of the fouling attachments caused a considerable decrease in the total mass of fouling from 0.0104 to 0.007 kg/m2, as can be seen in Figure 5.46 (b). This indicates that an increase in the ionic strength via an increase in pH resulted in some enhancement of the anti135

fouling property of the feed and the membrane. The decrease in the total mass of fouling caused a reduction in the resistance to the flow. Therefore, the increase in the transmembrane pressure over the duration of the filtration process was reduced, and hence, the specific power consumption decreased from 10.17 to 6.9 kWh/m3. In addition, decreasing of both attachments resulted in increasing permeate flux from 0.0125 to 0.018 m3/m2, as shown in Figure 5.46 (a). On the other hand, in acidic conditions the hydrophilic membrane became less negatively charged (more hydrophobic). This can be attributed to the more solubility of H+ functional group. As the pH decreased from 7 to 3, the zeta potential of the membrane surface became significantly less negative, decreasing from -36.67 to -18.11 mV, respectively. This in turn results in a stronger electrostatic attractive force between the latex particles and the membrane surface. As a consequence, more particle-to-membrane attachment would occur. As illustrated in Figure 5.46 (a), when pH was decreased from 7 to 3, a considerable increase in the depositional attachment from 0.55 to 0.82 was observed. Moreover, the lowering of the pH reduced the negative charge on the particles, thus causing a stronger electrostatic attraction force between particles and encouraging particle aggregation. As the pH decreased from 7 to 3, the zeta potential of latex particles became significantly less negative, decreasing from -26.61 to 11.2 mV, respectively.A stronger electrostatic attraction and particle aggregation resulted in an increased coagulation attachment from 0.4 to 0.59. Moreover, SEM images obtained after the ultrafiltration provided further evidence in support of the results acquired previously. Particularly, at pH = 7 the cake thickness was 5.05 µm, as shown in Figure 5.47 (a). The cake height decreased to 3.6 µm at pH=10, as can be seen in Figure 5.47 (b).The cake thickness further diminished to 1.85 µm at pH = 12, as illustrated in Figure 5.47 (c). This was due to the significant reduction in the particle-to-particle attachment, which was the predominant factor responsible for the cake formation.

In the previous section, the minimum specific power consumption occurred at the lowest flow rate of 1 LPM. On the other hand, at the lowest flow rate the total mass of fouling and the cake layer thickness were highest. Therefore, the effect of pH on the membrane fouling and the specific power consumption at a low feed flow rate of 1 LPM was further investigated. It was observed that at a feed flow rate of 1 LPM, the transmembrane pressure of 15 psi and the feed solid concentration of 1.3 kg/m3,when the solution pH was increased from 7 to 12, the total mass of fouling decreased from 0.0162 to 0.0081 kg/m2, as can be seen in Figure 5.48 (b). This contributed to the considerable reduction in both attachment probabilities pp and pm, from 0.86 to 0.40 and from 0.82 to 0.37, respectively, as shown in Figure 5.48 (a). Therefore, the membrane fouling was lessened, leading to a decrease in the transmembrane pressure elevation over the duration of the experiment from 6 psi to 1 psi. Consequently, the specific power consumption decreased from 4.62 to 2.06 kWh/m3, as presented in Figure 5.48 (b). Moreover, at the solution pH of 12, a volumetric permeate flux of 0.015 m3/m2 was obtained, which is higher than the permeate flux at a higher feed flow rate of 6 LPM with the solution pH of 7 and the same other operating conditions.

Increasing pH value to 10 resulted in a significant 138

reduction in the cake thickness to 6.1 µm. At pH=12 the cake thickness was further reduced to 2.3 µm, which is very close to the cake thickness of 2.4 µm at Q=6 LPM, TMP=15 psi, Cf =1.3 kg/m3and pH=7. However, at the lower feed flow rate of 1 LPM, TMP=15 psi, Cf =1.3 kg/m3 and pH=12, the specific power consumption was only 2.06 kWh/m3 (Figure 5.49 (b)), compared with 13.1 kWh/m3 at Q=6 LPM, TMP=15 psi, Cf =1.3 kg/m3and pH=7 (Figure 5.19 (b)).

A sole increase of the feed flow rate reduced membrane fouling but accompanied by high power consumption. On the other hand, an increased feed flow rate accompanied by an augmented pH value had a noticeable improvement 139

in the specific power consumption. On the overall, a reduced flow rate in combination with an increased pH had best effects on both the membrane fouling and the specific power consumption.

The solution pH was varied within a range from 3 to 12. Figure 5.50 shows similar trends for the fouling attachments, the volumetric permeate flux, the total mass of fouling, and the specific power consumption as those at TMP=15 psi shown Figure 5.45. However, ultrafiltration at TMP of 25 psi resulted in higher values for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane attachments. For instance, at pH=10, the particle-to-particle attachment was 0.40 and 0.26, at TMP of 25 psi and 15 psi, respectively. At a higher TMP, the permeate flux was higher. More particles were thus brought to the membrane surface; hence, more chances for the particle-to-particle and particle-to-membrane collision and attachment occurred. Consequently, the particle-to-particle and particle-tomembrane attachment increased. At TMP=25 psi and Q=4 LPM, increases in pH from 7 to 12 resulted in a significant reduction in the total mass of fouling from 0.012 kg/m 2 to 0.0077 kg/m2. Consequently, the specific power consumption was reduced from 14.0 kWh/m3 to 10.1 kWh/m3, as shown in Figure 5.50 (b). Figure 5.51 (a) and (b) presents SEM images of the cake height after ultrafiltration at the solution pH of 7 and 10, respectively. The cake thickness decreased from 6.65 to 5.30 µm when the pH was raised from 7 to 10. SEM images in Figure 5.51 and Figure 5.47 provide a confirmation of the effect of the transmembrane pressure on the cake height.

As shown in Table 5.30 at pH of 3 and 5, lower fouling attachment probabilities, lower total total mass of fouling, higher volumetric permeate flux and lower power consumption were achieved with sulfuric acid. This can be attributed to the more negative charge sulphate ion, SO42-, of sulfuric 141

acid, which makes the membrane less hydrophobic in comparison to the chlorine ion, Cl-, of hypochloric acid. It is relevant to note that the zeta potential of the membrane surface at pH=3 was -18.11 mV and -16.31 mV with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, respectively. When pH was increased to 5, the zeta potential of the membrane surface increased to -24.78 mV using sulfuric acid, in comparison to -20.55 mV using hydrochloric acid. This again reconfirms the advantage of sulfuric acid over hydrochloric acid in fouling mediation. Figure 5.52 presents the SEM images of the cake thickness at pH=3 using sulfuric acid and hypochloric acid. The cake thickness increased to 6.35 µm for 0.1 N H2SO4 to 7.65 µm for 0.1 N HCl.

5.8.1.4. Effect of pre-treatment of simulated latex effluent by pH change on filtration using heterogeneous membranes The simulated latex effluent with a solid concentration of 1.30 kg/m3 has a pH of 7. The zeta potential of latex particles at pH 7 is approximately -26.61 mV. As the pH increased from 7 to 11 the zeta potential negativity of latex particles had increased significantly from -26.61 mV to -40.00 mV, as shown in Figure 5.53. The adsorption of OH- group on the particle surface at higher pH values in turn caused the negative charge on the latex particle surfaces to increase until it achieved -42.66 mV at pH of 12. Furthermore, the solution conductivity increased from 0.094 to 20.4 mS/cm when the solution pH was increased from 7 to 11. Notably, the ionic strength is directly proportional to the solution conductivity. On the other hand, decreasing pH from 7 to 3 using sulfuric acid resulted in a substantial decrease in the zeta potential value from 26.61 mV to -11.20 mV. It is relevant to note that the zeta potential of the latex particles was 4.83 mV at pH of 3 using hydrochloric acid (HCl). This can be attributed to the more negative charge of sulphate ion, SO42- , of sulfuric acid in comparison to the chlorine ion, Cl-, of hydrochloric acid. In addition, the zeta potential of each membrane surface was investigated at each pH value so as to simulate the effects of pH of the latex solution through the ultrafiltration process. As the pH of the simulated latex effluent was increased from 3 to 11, the zeta potential of PVDF, Ultrafilic, and Polysulfone membrane surfaces became increasingly negative: from -2.01 to 32.62 mV, -18.99 to -43.00 mV, and -5.67 to -41.98 mV, respectively, as shown in Figure 5.52. Notably, the hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic PVDF membrane surface was enhanced from -2.5 to -32.62 mV when the latex solution pH was increased from the original value of 7 to 11. While it resulted in an insignificant change in the surface of the Ultrafilic membrane from -41.5 to 43.00 mV. On the other hand, increasing the pH value from 7 to 11 resulted in a slight decrease in the membrane surface negativity of the Polysulfone membrane from -42.40 to -41.98 mV. This may be attributed to the fact that 25 minutes of the ultrafiltration process were not sufficient enough to change the zeta potential of Polysulfone membrane, of the unique chemical structure with the sulfone group, especially if compared to the two hour treatment of the surface soaked in alkaline as a membrane surface treatment.

Figure 5.53: Effect of pH change of latex effluent on the zeta potential of latex particles and the membrane surface through the ultrafiltration process

The results obtained indicated that the most significant influence of increasing the pH of simulated latex effluent through the ultrafiltration process occurred with the use of hydrophobic PVDF membrane surface, as presented in Figure 5.54. Due to the high adsorption of OH- group on the hydrophobic membrane surface. At the feed flow rate of 4 LPM, feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, and transmembrane pressure of 15 psi, using a PVDF membrane and increasing the pH value from 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in the zeta potential negativity from -2.5 mV to 32.62 mV. In addition to, the zeta potential negativity of latex particles had a significant increase from 26.61 mV to -40.00 mV. As a consequence, the repulsion force between the latex particles and the membrane surface increased, causing the depositional attachment to decrease from 0.97 to 0.21. Hence, the total mass of fouling significantly decreased by 29.60 % from 0.0125 to 0.0088 kg/m2, and the specific power consumption experienced a substantial decrease by 88.12 % from 15.4 to 1.83 kW.h/m3, while the permeate flux experiences a noticeable 7 time increase from 0.01 to 0.07 m3/m2. Figure 5.54 (a) and Figure 5.54(b) present the respective SEM images of PVDF membrane after ultrafiltration of simulated latex effluent at pH 7 and 11 at feed flow rate of 4 LPM, feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, and transmembrane pressure of 15 psi. As shown in Figure 5.54 (a), at pH of 7 the higher depositional attachment resulted in a greater number of latex particles deposited on the membrane surface, more blocked membrane pores, and a higher number of particles accumulated at the surface, due to the higher attraction force between PVDF membrane with the zeta potential of -2.50 mV and the latex particles with the 144

zeta potential of -26.61. On the other hand at Figure 5.54 (b), at pH of 11 the higher repulsion force between the PVDF membrane of higher zeta potential negativity of -32.62 mV and the latex particles of higher negativity of ­ 40.00 mV resulted in less particles deposited on the membrane surface and a presence of unrestricted membrane pores.

Although increasing the pH of latex solution from 7 to 11 had an insignificant effect on the surface charges hydrophilicty improvement of Polysulfone and Ultrafilic membranes. As the zeta potential negativity of Polysulfone decreased from -42.40 to -41.98 mV, while the the zeta potential negativity slightly increased from -41.50 to -43.00 mV. However, the increase of the solution pH had a significant effect on the latex particles surface charge negativity, as it increased from -26.61 mV to -40.00 mV. Thus, ultrafilitation process using latex solution at pH of 11 and using Polysulfone and Ultrafilic membranes were performed in order to investigate the effect of foulants surface charge on the membrane fouling, cumulative permeate flux, and the specific power consumption. At the feed flow rate of 4 LPM, feed concentration of 1.30 kg/m3, and transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, the total mass of fouling decreased by 11.11 % from 0.0135 kg/m2 to 0.012 kg/m2, while the cumulative filtration volume increased by 10.43% from 0.115 to 0.127 m3/m2 using Polyulfone membrane. Consequently, the specific power consumption was lowered by 20.56% from 2.14 kW.h/m3 to 1.7 kW.h/m3. Similarly, at the same operating conditions the total mass of fouling decreased by 24 % from 0.025 kg/m2 to 0.019 kg/m2, while the cumulative filtration volume was increased by 38.21% from 0.123 to 0.17 m3/m2. The decrease in total mass of fouling resulted in a decrease in the specific power

145

consumption by 28.02 % from 1.82 kW.h/m3 to 1.31 kW.h/m3. As a result, the latex particles charge was found to have a significant effect when it came to increasing the repulsion forces between latex particles and membrane surfaces.

5.8.2. pH treatment for membrane surface The effect of the surface hydrophilicity after the pH treatment of the membrane surface on fouling attachments, the total mass of fouling, permeate flux- and specific power consumption was also investigated. Polysulfone membrane surface charges from -10mV to -50 mV were obtained by soaking the membrane for 2 hours in solutions at varied pH from 2.4 to 10.9. Under the operating conditions of 25 psi, 4.5 LPM, 1.30 kg/m3, increasing the zeta potential of the membrane surface from -10.00 to -50.00 mV, resulted in a substantial reduction of depositional attachment (pm) by 65%, from 0.99 to 0.35, as shown in Figure 5.55 (a). This could be attributed to the increased hydrophilicity of the membrane, which was created upon introducing more negative charges on the membrane surface. As a result, the electrostatic attraction force between the latex particles and the higher negatively charged membrane surface was significantly decreased. The particle-to-membrane attachment was thus notably reduced. On the other hand, increasing the zeta potential negativity of the membrane surface caused an insignificant decrease in the coagulation attachment (pp) by 5.3%, from 0.75 to 0.71, as shown in Figure 5.55 (a). The decrease in the depositional attachment resulted in a significant increase in the cumulative filtration volume per unit area (Vs) from 0.015 to 0.123 m3/m2, an augmentation of about 10 folds, as shown in Figure 5.55 (a). This could be attributed to the significant reduction in the depositional attachment that resulted in a lower frequency of particle attached to the membrane pores, i.e. less pore blockage for the filtrate passage through the membrane. As a consequence, the total mass of fouling diminished by 61%, from 0.018 to 0.007 kg/m2, as indicated in Figure 5.55 (b). Decreasing the total mass of fouling resulted in a lower rate of the transmembrane pressure increase during the filtration process. Accordingly, the specific power consumption was dramatically decreased by 92.5%, from 24.83 to 1.86 kW.h/m3, as presented in Figure 5.55 (b). From these observations a conclusion can be drawn that the depositional attachment is the predominant factor in membrane fouling. In addition, altering the particle-to-membrane attachment (pm) by manipulating the zeta potential of the membrane surface could be an essential process in fouling remediation. Figure 5.56 (a) presents SEM image of Polysulfone 146

membrane with the zeta potential of -50.00 mV after ultrafiltration at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, a feed flow rate of 4.5 LPM, and a feed concentration of 1.30 kg/m 3. Alternatively, Figure 5.56 (b) presents an SEM image of Polysulfone membrane with the zeta potential of 10.00 mV after ultrafiltration at the same operating conditions. As shown in Figure 5.56 (a), the lower depositional attachment caused a decrease in the total mass of fouling, due to the reduced chances for particles to participate in particle-to-membrane attachment.

When using the same operating conditions, the reduction of the negativity of the surface charge of Ultrafilic membrane, from the original zeta potential value of -41.50 mV to -30.00 mV, caused a noticeable decrease in repulsion force between the membrane surface and latex particles. This in turn caused the depositional attachment (pm) to increase from 0.70 to 0.85. A 147

significantly higher pm facilitated a larger number of particle attachments to the membrane surface, thus resulting in a greater pore blockage, a lowered cumulative filtration volume per unit area from 0.123 to 0.115 m3/m2, power consumption upsurge from 1.82 to 1.93 kW.h/m3, and an overall increase in the mass of fouling from 0.025 to 0.03 kg/m2. A continued decrease in the surface negativity, from -30.00 mV to -15.00 mV, resulted in an additional increase in the depositional attachment, from 0.85 to 0.96. As a consequence, the cumulative filtration volume per unit area lowered from 0.115 to 0.03 m3/m2, and the mass of fouling was augmented from 0.03 to 0.05 kg/m2. The increase in the total mass of fouling resulted in the increase in the transmembrane pressure, which in turn caused a higher rate through the filtration process, allowing the power consumption to increase from 1.93 to 7.5 kW.h/m3. Notably, when using an Ultrafilic membrane with the zeta potentials of -41.50 mV, -30.00 mV, and -15.00 mV, the coagulation attachment (pp) was 0.76, 0.76, and 0.77, respectively. Figure 5.57 (a), Figure 5.57 (b), and Figure 5.57 (c) feature the SEM images for Ultrafilic membrane after ultrafiltration at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, a feed flow rate of 4 LPM, and a feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, at the zeta potentials of -41.50 mV, -30.00 mV, and -15.00 mV, respectively. Figure 5.57 (b) showcases the fact that decreasing the negativity of the surface charge of the Ultrafilic membrane caused a smaller number of clean pores, the greater number of particle attachments to the membrane surface, and a higher chance of particle-to-particle collisions and attachments, if compared to Figure 5.57 (a). An extensive particle deposition on the membrane surface was caused by a further decrease in the surface negativity, which ensured an even higher chance for the particles to contribute to the coagulation attachment and cake formation, as shown in Figure 5.57 (c).

5.8.3. Simulated latex effluent treatment using anionic surfactant As the anionic surfactant concentration increased from 0.0001 g/L to 0.1 g/L, the ionic strength of the latex solution increased, and the solution conductivity increased from 0.0944 to 6.5210 mS/cm. However, the zeta potential negativity decreased from -26.61 mV to -4.86 mV, as shown in Table 5.31. This can be attributed to the electrostatic repulsions between the highly charged latex surface and the anionic head groups. As a consequence, the anionic surfactant stayed in the latex solution, which resulted in the low electrical stability of colloids, and a significant decrease in the potential difference between the bulk liquid and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the dispersed latex particles. The zeta potential negativity of the latex particles was thus reduced. Furthermore, Table 5.31 illustrates the effects of LAS additions to the latex solution on the zeta potential of the membrane surface through the ultrafiltration process. The LAS concentration of 0.0001 g/L was an optimum concentration for the enhancement of hydrophobic PVDF surface charge, while it had an insignificant effect on Ultrafilic membrane at this concentration. However, the addition of LAS had an opposite effect on the Polysulfone membrane, as presented in Table 5.31. This may attributed to the unique chemical structure of the Polysulfone membrane with the sulfone group. The repulsion between the functional group of anionic surfactant and the functional group of Polysulfone explain the

unchanged hydrophilicity of the membrane surface after treatment with LAS. The results in Table 5.31 also indicate that increasing the LAS concentration to more than 0.0001 g/L resulted in a decreased zeta potential negativity of PVDF and Ultrafilic membrane surface. The increase in the concentration of the anionic surfactants in latex solution caused a reduction in the potential difference between the latex solution and the membrane surface. It should also be mentioned that the micellar ulfiltration at the CMC of LAS of 0.1 g/L had the least favorable results for the zeta potential negativity of latex particles and featured a decrease from -26.61 to -4.86 mV. Furthermore, the zeta potential negativity of Polysulfone, Ultrafilic, and PVDF changed from -42.40 to 0.96 mV, -41.50 to 3.58 mV, and -2.5 to -0.26 mV, respectively. The reason for this behavior stems from the fact that when the micelles were formed, as shown in Figure 5.58, they reduced the interfacial tension between a latex solution and the membrane surface or the latex particle surface. In addition, the electrostatic repulsions between the highly charged membrane surfaces or the latex particles and the micelles increased, which resulted in the presence of the micelle in the solution. Hence, a substantial decrease in the 149

potential difference between the liquid and the surfaces can occur. Moreover, the maximum allowable concentration of LAS in wastewater discharged to the environment is 1 ppm (1 mg/L), because LAS was found to be fully biodegradable. Hence, the toxicity of LAS at this concentration of 1x10-4 g/L was found to be safe for marine, freshwater, and estuarine environments (Morrow and Piwoni, 1993).

Furthermore, the effect of LAS at various time treatments was investigated at a concentration of 0.0001 g/L and the CMC concentration of 0.1 g/L. At a zero concentration of LAS, the zeta potential of latex particles and the conductivity of simulated latex effluent are 26.61 mV and 0.0944 mS/cm, respectively. As presented in Table 5.32, right after the addition of LAS, the zeta potential of latex particles was dropped to -0.94 mV and -2.13 mV, at the concentration of 0.0001 g/L and 0.1 g/L, respectively. Due to the increase of anionic heads in the latex solutions, there was a significant change in charge of the dispersion medium with respect to the dispersed particle, which in turn resulted in a significant decrease in the potential difference between the bulk liquid and the dispersed latex particles. Consequently, the zeta potential negativity was significantly decreased. The latex solution ionic strength increased through the 150

addition of the anionic surfactant due to the presence of the negative charge hydrophilic head of the anionic surfactant. Hence, the latex solution conductivity was increased to 0.3070 mS/cm and 6.4411 mS/cm, as LAS was added at the concentration of 0.0001 g/L and 0.1 g/L, respectively. The optimum time was determined to be 15 minutes for both concentrations for the addition of LAS as feed pretreatment. The zeta potential measurements of latex particles indicated that the treatment time was ineffective as a method of increasing the zeta potential negativity of latex particles, as presented in Table 5.32. Furthermore, the zeta potential of latex particles had very low negative values at the CMC of LAS, as depicted in Table 5.32. Due to the negative influence of micelles formation on the reduction of zeta potential negativity as previously discussed. Moreover, the treatment time had an insignificant effect on the solution ionic strength at both concentrations.

The influence of adding LAS at a concentration of 0.0001 g/L to the latex solution 15 minutes before the ultrafiltration process using hydrophilic membranes was investigated. At the feed flow rate of 4 LPM, feed concentration of 1.30 kg/m3, and transmembrane pressure of 25 psi, the total mass of fouling substantially increased from 0.0135 kg/m2 to 0.0931 kg/m2, while the cumulative filtration volume significantly decreased from 0.115 to 0.078 m3/m2 using the Polyulfone membrane. Due to the decrease of the zeta potential negativity of latex particles from -26.61 mV to -24.05 mV, in addition to the substantial decrease of Polysulfone surface charge negativity from -42.40 mV to -25.22 mV, there was a higher attraction force between foulants and the membrane surface. As a consequence, the depositional attachment increased from 0.76 to 151

0.91. The increase in the total mass of fouling caused an increase in the specific power consumption from 2.14 kW.h/m3 to 4.14 kW.h/m3. At the same operating conditions, Ultrafilic membrane showed a slight increase in the total mass of fouling and a slight decrease in the cumulative permeate volume, from 0.025 to 0.0261 kg/m2 and from 0.123 to 0.119 m3/m2 respectively. While the specific power consumption slightly increased from 1.82 to 1.86 kW.h/m3. The reason for this slight changes can be found in the decrease in the zeta potential negativity of latex particles from -26.61 mV to -24.05 mV was slight more than the enhancement of Ultrafilic surface hydrophilicity from -41.50 mV to -41.97 mV. In this case the deposition attachment was slightly increased from 0.7 to 0.72. Thus, the results indicate that the LAS addition can be considered an ineffective pre-treatment for limiting the fouling propensity of the latex solution when using hydrophilic membranes. On the other hand, the addition of LAS to the latex solution had a definitively positive effect on the enhancement of the surface charge of the PVDF hydrophobic membrane from -2.5 to -28.66 mV. Thus, the repulsion force between the latex particles and the membrane surface increased even though the zeta potential negativity of the latex particles was decreased from 26.61 to -24.05 mV. As a result, the depositional attachment decreased from 0.97 to 0.54, the total mass of fouling significantly lowered by 12.80 % from 0.0125 to 0.0109 kg/m2, and the specific power consumption experienced a substantial decrease by 34.15 % from 15.4 to 10.14 kW.h/m3. Nevertheless, the feed pretreatment, that includes the increasing of the solution alkalinity to pH of 11, was found to enhance the PVDF surface charge more than the addition of 0.0001 g/L of LAS, in addition to the significant effect of higher pH on the latex particle negativity enhancement. The results obtained indicate that the total mass of fouling was decreased by 29.60 %, in case of the feed pretreatment where the pH was increased to the value of 11, and decreased to 12.80%, with the addition of 0.0001 g/L LAS. While the specific power consumption was decreased by 88.12% in case of the feed pretreatment by pH change, and decreased by 34.15 % in the instance where LAS was added. 5.8.4. Membrane surface treatment using anionic surfactant This study investigated the effect of the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane surface using anionic surfactant, on fouling attachments, the total mass of fouling, permeate flux, and specific power consumption. As shown in Figure 5.59 (a), the LAS treatment had a noticeable effect on hydrophobic PVDF and hydrophilic Ultrafilic membranes at low concentration of 152

0.0001 g/L. Alternatively, LAS treatment was ineffective in the case of the Polysulfone membrane. Notably, the results suggested that LAS treatment was ineffective for Polysulfone membranes even in the instances where soaking was implemented for long periods of time. This is may be attributed to the repulsion between the functional group of LAS and the functional group of Polysulfone membrane. The original zeta potential value of each membrane is

highlighted at Y-axis in Figure 5.59 (a). The optimum enhancement of membrane surface hydrophilicity occurred during the LAS treatments at a concentration of 0.0001 g/L. The optimum time for LAS treatment was 15 and 20 minutes, for Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes, respectively. However, zeta potential negativity of PVDF and Ultrafilic membranes had an opposite trend after the optimum time, as shown in Figure 5.59 (a). At the CMC, LAS treatment had an opposite effect on the zeta potential of membrane surfaces due to the micelles formation, as shown in Figure 5.59(b). The surface charge negativity was turned into positive charge from 42.40 to 1.62 mV, -41.50 to 4.07 mV, -2.50 to 0.26 mV, for the Polysulfone, Ultrafilic, and PVDF membranes, respectively. Figure 5.60 (a) and Figure 5.60 (b) simulate the attraction between anionic surfactant hydrophilic head and hydrophilic surfaces, as well as, between anionic surfactant hydrophilic head and hydrophobic membrane surfaces. It should be mentioned that the LAS treatment for the membrane surface had a more noticeable effect than the addition of LAS to the latex solution as a feed pretreatment before the ultrafiltration process. This can be attributed to the fact that the soaking time for the membranes in LAS is more effective than the ultrafiltration process duration. For instance, the zeta potential negativity of PVDF membrane was enhanced from -2.50 to -28.66 mV, and from -2.50 to -40.90 using LAS as feed pretreatment, and for membrane surface treatment, respectively. Furthermore, in the mentioned cases the negative effects of LAS addition to latex solution on the zeta potential of latex particles was avoided.

As shown in Figure 5.59, the results obtained indicated that the most significant effect of LAS, at a low concentration of 1x10-4 g/L, was on the hydrophobic PVDF membrane by increasing the membrane surface charge from -2.50 mV to -40.90 mV after 20 minutes of membrane treatment. This increase was due to the high electrostatic attraction between the anionic heads of LAS and the PVDF membrane surface, as shown in Figure 5.60 (b). At the feed flow rate of 4 LPM, feed concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, and transmembrane pressure of 15 psi, the repulsion force between the latex particles of untreated latex effluent and the membrane surface was increased. As a consequence, the depositional attachment (pm) decreased from 0.97 to 0.1. Hence, the total mass of fouling experienced a substantial decrease by 44.0 %, from 0.0125 kg/m2 to 0.007 kg/m2, the specific power consumption significantly decreased by 92.1%, from 15.4 kW.h/m3 to 1.21 kW.h/m3, while the permeate flux perceptibly increased from 0.01 to 0.124 m3/m2.

It should be also mentioned that in the case of treated PVDF membrane surface, using anionic surfactants at a low concentration of 0.0001 g/L, had more favorable results than the best results obtained by feed pre-treatment occurring due to the pH change. As such, the total mass of fouling decreased by 44.0% and 29.6%, in case of treated membrane surface with anionic surfactant, and treated latex solution feed at pH of 11, respectively. Moreover, the specific power consumption was substantially decreased by 92.1% and 88.1%, in case of the treated membrane surface with anionic surfactant, and in the instance of the treated latex solution feed at pH of 11, respectively. Although when the pH of latex solution was increased to 11 the membrane surface charge was changed from -2.50 mV to -32.62 mV, in addition to the significant increase of the latex particles surface charge from -26.61 mV to -40.00 mV. As a consequence, the depositional attachment, pm, decreased from 0.97 to 0.21. However, when the ultrafiltration process was performed with the PVDF treated surface using anionic surfactants of the zeta potential of -40.90 mV with untreated simulated latex effluent with the particle zeta potential of -26.61 mV, the depositional attachment was 0.1. This gives a strong indication of the significant impact that membrane surface charge has when it comes to contributing to the attachment force between the membrane surface and the foulants, in comparison to the potential effects of the latex particle's charge. Moreover, the ultrafiltration process was performed using treated Ultrafilic membranes using LAS with concentration of 0.0001 g/L for 15 minutes. At feed flow rate of 1 LPM, 155

transmembrane pressure of 35 psi, and feed concentration of 1.3 kg/m3, the total mass of fouling was decreased by 28.0% from 0.0278 kg/m2 to 0.02 kg/m2, due to the increase of surface charge negativity from -41.50 mV to -50.67 mV which caused a significant decrease in the attraction force between latex particles and Ultrafilic membrane surface. Hence, the depositional attachment was decreased from 0.98 to 0.84. Figure 5.62 presents SEM images of the Ultrafilic membranes after ultrafiltration process using treated and untreated membranes. As shown in Figure 5.62(b), the latex particle depositions was decreased at the same operating conditions when Ultrafilic membrane was soaked for 15 minutes using 0.0001 g/L LAS.

A comparative analysis was conducted on the effect of enhancing the PVDF membrane's surface hydrophilicty on the membrane's performance, with the effects of increasing the ionic strength of the latex solution either by pH or LAS. Figure 5.63 illustrates that the best membrane performance and cumumlative permeate volume per unit area was obtained when the PVDF membrane surface was treated with LAS. The second best PVDF performance results were obtained in the case of untreated PVDF membrane and treated simulated latex solution at pH of 11, followed by trated latex solution with LAS and featuring untreated PVDF.

5.8.5. Simulated latex effluent treatment using cationic surfactant The effect of the cationic surfactant, CTAB, on the latex particle size distribution was also studied. Figure 5.65 (a), Figure 5.65 (b), and Figure 5.65 (c) depict the particle size (diameter) distribution of the latex solution with a solid concentration of 0.78 kg/m3, 1.30 kg/m3, 1.82 kg/m3, respectively, at different CTAB concentrations. As shown in Figure 5.65, the particle size distribution of the treated latex solution featured noticeable shifts in the peaks toward larger size ranges due to the aggregation of latex particles. At the CMC concentration of CTAB of 0.36 g/L or the lower concentration of 0.18 g/L, latex particle sizes smaller than 1 microns were by the most part eliminated. The treated latex solution at the CMC of CTAB had the largest particle sizes. This can be attributed to the fact that at the critical micelles concentration (CMC) the micelles formed, as illustrated in Figure 5.66. At this point, the positively charged hydrophilic heads were attracted and clustered around the negatively charged latex paint solids. Figure 5.67 presented the SEM images of the latex particles after the ultrafiltration process, both, with and without the addition of CTAB to the latex solution and featuring the concentration of 1.3 kg/m3 as feed pre-treatment. As shown in Figure 5.67 (b), which offers a lower magnification of 300, the aggregated latex particles were almost the same size, if compared to the particles at 3 times higher magnification of 1000, without the CTAB addition presented in Figure 5.67 (a).

Figure 5.67: SEM of latex particles after the ultrafiltration process (a) without CTAB addition at magnification of 1000, (b) with CTAB pre-treatment at magnification of 300 Figure 5.68 shows the particle size distribution of untreated and treated simulated latex effluent at the CMC of CTAB at different concentrations of the latex solution. The latex particles had the largest sizes at the solution concentration of 1.82 kg/m3, followed by 1.3 kg/m3, and finally 0.78 kg/m3. For CTAB at the CMC concentration of 0.36 g/L, the treatment duration was found to have no effect on the particle size distribution, as can be seen in Figure 5.69. The particle size distributions of the latex solutions treated for 5, 10, and 15 minutes were almost identical. This indicates that particles aggregated together, and then formed clusters of particles within a matter of a few seconds or minutes. The particles dispersed in the liquid phase stuck to each other, growing in size and then forming irregular particle clusters or aggregates. Because of this observation, the 10 minutes duration was selected within this study as the feed pre-treatment time for the CTAB addition to the simulated latex effluent. It should be also noted that the particle size distribution could not be measured in a period less than 5 minutes, due to the time necessary for the sample preparation and the calibration of the particle size analyzer. Figure 5.70 illustrates the effect of CTAB addition to the latex solution on the cake formation on the membrane surface. The images clearly indicate that the cake layer was less compact in Figure 5.70 (b), as compared to the sample without the cationic surfactant in Figure 5.70 (a). This may be attributed to the presence of newly formed coarse particles by agglomeration of fine latex particles with CTAB, in the cake layer, resulting in larger lumps as can be seen in Figure 5.70 (b).

Particle aggregation is normally an irreversible process. However, particle aggregates can be disrupted and dispersed if stirring is applied. As shown in Figure 5.71, the minimal agitation, 2-3 seconds, during the addition of CTAB to the latex solution featured the largest size particles. A large portion of the particle size distribution peaks between 100 to 1000 microns, as compared to the range of 1 to 100 microns for longer stirring time. This might be due to agitation's high shear capable of effectively breaking down aggregated particles. In fact, Figure 5.72 provides additional evidence of the dispersion of the aggregated particles from small-angle scattering of X-rays (SAXS). The scattering patterns in the small-angle regime reflect a decay of scattered intensity due to decreasing the particle size, which reduces the number of electrons in a given volume (Svergun and Koch, 2003). The scattered intensity is a proportional relationship of the particle size as a function of the interparticle interactions (Kotlarchyk M, Chen, 1983; Liu et al., 2005). As shown in Figure 5.72 (a), the intensity of the waves reaches 2700 because of the aggregated particles occurring once CTAB was added to the latex solution with minimal stirring, while the maximum wave intensity was around 600 after 1 minute stirring, as presented in Figure 5.72 (b). Figure 5.73 (b) presents an SEM image of the aggregated latex particles with the concentration of 1.82 kg/m3 after the addition of CTAB at CMC concentration for the duration of 10 minutes as feed pre-treatment with minimal agitation. Figure 5.73 (a) features the SEM image of latex particles after 2 minutes of continuous stirring during the CTAB addition at the same operating conditions. Figure 5.73 (b) offers evidence to support data in Figure 5.68 that at a higher concentration of 1.82 kg/m3 the latex particles grew larger in size.

The addition of CTAB to the latex solution as a feed pre-treatment prior to the ultrafiltration process caused a decrease in the negative charge of the latex particles and the membrane surfaces throughout the duration of the ultrafiltration process. The zero concentration of CTAB represents the original zeta potential values of latex particles and the membrane surfaces on the Y-axis, as shown in Figure 5.74. Increasing the concentration of CTAB resulted in a continuous decrease of the negative charge until reaching the CMC of CTAB, at which point it started to level off. This is an effectual consequence of the electrostatic attractions that exist between the negatively charged membrane surface and the cationic head groups, which caused an increase in the membrane surface's positive charge. As a consequence, the zeta potential negativity of the membrane surface was significantly reduced. Similarly, the charge positivity of latex particles increased from -26.61 mV to +20.30 mV due to the micelles formation with CTAB at its CMC. It should be noted that the treatment time was ineffective on the zeta potential 163

of latex particles, or the membrane surfaces at CMC, as shown in Figure 5.75. However, decreasing the surface negativity of the latex particles and the membrane surfaces at a similar trend and magnitude would result in a similar repulsion between them during the ultrafiltration process, as compared to the untreated latex solution.

Figure 5.75: Zeta potential of latex particles and various membrane surfaces at CMC of CTAB at different treatment durations 5.8.5.1.CTAB influence on membrane fouling using a homogeneous polycarbonate membrane Table 5.33 and Table 5.34 showcases the results obtained through the ultrafiltration process at different operating conditions using Polycarbonate homogeneous membranes with pore sizes of 0.1 and 0.05 µm, while utilizing untreated simulated latex effluent, and treated latex solution with CTAB at CMC, respectively. As indicated in Table 5.34, the total mass of particles 164

contributing to pore blocking was diminished for each of the experimental runs. The reason for these results can be allocated to the aggregation of very small particles, less than 0.1 and 0.05 microns in size, and the fact that this size range was eliminated from the particle size distribution which is what generally contributes to pore blocking. The mass of particles contributed to pore blocking was attributed to the traces of small contaminated particles in the simulated latex effluent. Therefore, the depositional attachment, which represents the attachment of particles to the membrane's surface or membrane pores, was calculated based on the experimental values and was shown to be reduced. Each experimental run within this study was repeated 4 times so as to ensure the accuracy of the results with 95 % of confidence intervals. As depicted in Figure 5.76 (a), for each experimental run the depositional attachment was reduced by 6.1%, to 11.7%. While in Figure 5.76 (b), the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking was reduced up to 97 %. Although there was a significant reduction in the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking, the total mass of fouling was only decreased by up to 35.0%. The reason for this limited result was that the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking accounts for only 5.0% of the total mass of fouling, in cases with homogeneous Polycarbonate membranes of uniform pore size of 0.05 µm or 0.1 µm, and due to the original latex particle size distribution of simulated latex effluent. On the other hand, the aggregated large particles contributing to the cake build up were also reduced by up to 35.0 %, as shown in Table 5.34. The reduction of cake layer was caused by the ability of large aggregated particles to go through the cross ultrafiltration to the permeate stream, instead of engaging in collision and deposition between other particles and allowing for the coagulation attachment. Thus, the coagulation attachment, which represents particle-to-particle attachment, was reduced by up to 14.0%. In addition to the aggregation of the particles eliminated from the deposition there were changes with respect to the smaller particles in the cake. In particular, the presence of the larger sizes of the micelles, if compared to the original particles, resulted in a less dense cake layer, allowing more water molecules to pass freely into the permeate stream. Furthermore, after the initial layer of micelles was built onto the surface of the membranes, the similar surface charge of the approaching micelles would cause a repulsion force, essentially increasing the diffusion of particles away from the membrane's surface. As a result, the cumulative permeate volume was significantly increased up to 21.8 % with the addition of CTAB at CMC which improved the ultrafiltration process, as shown in 165

Figure 5.77(a). The transmembrane pressure was likewise significantly reduced by 12.5%, to 25.0%, due to the less condensed cake layer of the small particles as in the case of untreated latex solution. Decreasing the average transmembrane pressure through the ultrafiltration process and increasing the permeate results in a substantial overall decrease of specific power consumption. Thus, the specific power consumption is directly proportional to the average transmembrane pressure within the ultrafiltration process and is inversely proportional to the cumulative permeate volume.

Figure 5.77 (b) reveals a significant reduction in irreversible fouling, ranging from 28.9% to 51.5% decrease in the mass of fouling. This significant reduction of irreversible fouling is directly related to the elimination of the very small particles that are less than the pore diameter and do not get attached to the membrane wall which generally contributes to irreversible fouling. In addition, the bigger particles that are attached to the membrane's surface are less dense and can thus be easily washed away through the backwash process.

5.8.5.2.CTAB influence on membrane fouling using a heterogeneous PS membrane The results obtained after the ultrafiltration process using heterogeneous Polysulfone membranes with untreated and treated simulated latex effluent, and utilizing CTAB at CMC concentration for 10 minutes feed pretreatment at minimal agitation, are presented in Table 5.35. The addition of CTAB at CMC caused a significant reduction in the total mass of fouling by up to 27.0%, as shown in Figure 5.78 (a). The percentage of reduction in the cases with Polysulfone membranes was less than the percentage of reduction using homogeneous membranes, due to the matrix nature of Polysulfone heterogeneous membrane featuring different pore sizes, which constrict the continuous washing of aggregated particles through the cross ultrafiltration, if compared to homogeneous membranes. In addition, the mass of particles contributing to pore blocking was significantly reduced from 32.6% to 55.5%, but not diminished to 97.0% as in the case of homogeneous Polycarbonate membranes. This is due to the fact that in the case of Polycarbonate membranes with small uniform pore size the large particles could not pass through the membrane's pores, which effectually eliminated the chances of collisions and attachments of particles and membrane pore. Nevertheless, the chances of collision and attachments between a wide range of aggregated particle, sizes 1 to 1000 microns with Polysulfone membrane surface and its non-uniform pore size ranging up to 8.78 µm, was increased. Furthermore, the particle-to-membrane attachment was reduced by 8.8%, to 25.3%. It should be noted that in case of Polysulfone membrane with non-uniform pore size membrane, the mass of particles contributing to the cake layer was increased. In the case with non-uniform pore size this may be a result of the aggregated large particles which settled onto the matrix tissue of the membrane's surface and contributed to cake formation, instead of being washed away through the cross flow ultrafiltration process. Alternatively, the larger sized micelles aggregated particles permitted the formation of a less dense cake layer, which in turn allowed more water molecules to pass freely into the permeate stream. Therefore, the increase in transmembrane pressure was significantly decreased by 20.0%, to 42.8 %. Also, after the initial layer of micelles built onto the membrane's surface, the similar surface charges of the approaching micelles cause a repulsion force that essentially increased the diffusion of water through the particles. As a consequence, similar to the results obtained using homogeneous Polycarbonate membranes, the less dens cake layer allowed for 10.0 % to 26.9% improvement in the ultrafiltration process of cumulative permeate volume per unit, as presented in Figure 5.78 168

(b). Each experimental run during this study was repeated 4 times so as to ensure the accuracy of the results with 95% of confidence intervals.

Effect of combined pretreatment of latex solution and membrane surface on ultrafiltration performance For the purposes of the current research study it was likewise necessary to compare the effects of cationic surfactant as feed pretreatment, the effects of anionic surfactant on membrane surface treatment, and the combined effects of using cationic surfactant together with treated surface charges of different membranes. This comparative analysis is essential for attaining better fouling remediation results, and completing a comprehensive investigation of its impact on 169

the depositional attachment, the mass of fouling and the power consumption, all primary concern of this study.

As indicated in Table 5.36, the repulsion forces between the latex particles and the membrane surface was increased using the treated PVDF membranes featuring the zeta potential of -40.9 mV, in comparison to the untreated PVDF of -2.50 mV. Due to increase in the repulsion force, the depositional attachment (pm) decreased from 0.97 to 0.1. The total mass of fouling also experienced a substantial decrease by 44.0 %, from 0.0125 kg/m2 to 0.007 kg/m2, while the specific power consumption significantly decreased by 92.1 %, from 15.4 kW·h/m3 to 1.21 kW·h/m3, and the permeate flux increased from 0.01 to 0.124 m3/m2. Using the untreated PVDF membrane at the same operating conditions and treated latex solution with 0.36 g/L CTAB caused a substantial decrease in the original latex particles negativity of -26.61 mV and the PVDF membrane surface negativity of -2.5 mV, to 20.30 mV and 27.86 mV, respectively. Notably, this positive charge surrounding the latex particles and membrane surface resulted in 170

further repulsion force between latex particles and PVDF surface, when compared to the original case of the untreated ultrafiltration process. Hence, the depositional attachment decreased by 55.7%, from 0.97 to 0.43. The total mass of fouling was further decreased by 24.8 %, from 0.0125 kg/m2 to 0.0094 kg/m2, while the power consumption was lowered by 71.8%, from 15.4 kW·h/m3 to 4.4 kW·h/m3. The results presented in Table 4 highlights that the cationic surfactant CTAB at CMC as a feed pretreatment was a more effective treatment for latex solution than the anionic surfactant LAS when improving ultrafiltration performance and minimizing membrane fouling are considered. On the other hand, using the cationic surfactant had an opposite effect when the treated PVDF membrane surface was used. This was due to the opposite effect of the cationic surfactant on decreasing the surface negativity of treated membrane surfaces and latex particles from -40.90 mV to -10.33 mV and from -26.61 to 20.30, respectively. Hence, the attraction force between latex particles with zeta potential of 20.30 mV and the treated membrane surface was increased, if compared to untreated feed. As a consequence, the depositional attachment was significantly increased from 0.1 to 0.84. Therefore, the total mass of fouling was obviously increased by 162 %, from 0.0070 kg/m2 to 0.0113 kg/m2, and the specific power consumption was noticeably increased more than 10 times, from 1.2 kW·h/m3 to 13.5 kW·h/m3, when the treated membrane surface was combined with the pretreated latex solution with CTAB at CMC. Therefore, it can be concluded that ultrafiltration process using treated PVDF membrane with LAS at a concentration of 0.0001 g/L had the best performance, followed by the case with untreated membrane and pretreated feed using CTAB at CMC for 10 minutes with minimal agitation.

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
6.1. Conclusions The results of this study showed that:  Fouling could be primarily attributed to the attachments among foulant entities (coagulation attachment) and between foulants and membrane surfaces (depositional attachment). The fouling attachments are dependent not only on the properties of the foulants and the membranes but also on the solution chemistry. The reduction of membrane permeability caused by particles larger than the pore size was mainly by the pore blocking or the cake layer formation while the fouling by smaller particles was predominantly the internal fouling or the standard pore blocking.  The fouling attachment mechanistic model developed in this study could accurately and effectively incorporate the coupled effects of the chemical and physical factors involved in the membrane fouling, thus allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the fouling phenomenon. The transmembrane pressure estimated from the model agreed with the experimentally measured values, mostly within 5.0 - 8.0 % error, and up to 13.0 % error for the uniform, and non-uniform pore size membranes, respectively.  The mechanistic mathematical model and the fouling attachment correlations, taking into account the effect of the zeta potential on fouling, developed in the present study form a comprehensive set of predictive models in ultrafiltration of latex paint effluent under a constant feed flow rate and a cross-flow model, applicable to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes of a variety of materials with different molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) values. The masses of fouling experimentally measured agreed with the predicted values from the models, within the error ranges of 2.5-9.1%, and 4.0-14.3% for hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, respectively. The sphericity of the particles had a noticeable effect on the attachment model using homogeneous membranes. The systematic overestimation of the model acquired using the latex solution or the monodisperse particles can be attributed to the complexity of the model's calculation, which treats the average of

172

each particle size range as a matrix with each pore size range. Admittedly, the model's calculation is a dynamic somewhat different from the real fouling phenomenon.  The particle-to-membrane attachment is primarily responsible for reversible and irreversible membrane fouling. On the other hand, the particle-to-particle attachment probability was the predominant factor responsible for the cake formation, even though the particle-to-membrane attachment (pm) decreased with the increase in the solid feed concentration. Higher fouling probabilities caused an increase in the total mass of fouling retained by the membrane and the cake thickness, which in turn resulted in an increased resistance to the permeate flux.  The zeta potential of the membrane surface has a predominant effect on the fouling

attachment. The total mass of fouling and the power consumption could be reduced by manipulating the depositional attachment between latex particles and the membrane surface. However, the hydrophilicity of the membrane did not have a noticeable effect on the particle-to-particle attachment. For a PVDF membrane, the mass of fouling calculated using the correlations incorporating the zeta potential effect had a much lower error of 7.8 to 14.3% , as compared to the error of 26.7 to 43.3% using the correlations without the effect of the zeta potential of the membrane surface. Likewise, for the increase in the transmebrane pressure, the error range was 8.9 to 12.3%, as compared to 25 to 41.8% using the models without the effect of the zeta potential.  The numerical model of specific power consumption based on the fouling attachment model of the increase in transmembrane pressure agreed quite well with the power consumption calculated from the experimental values for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes of various materials, surface charges, and different MWCO with an error range of 6.0% up to 19.1%.  The morphological characteristics of the membrane, operating conditions, and membrane surface charge had a significant effect on the specific power consumption, and have a critical role that justifies their inclusion into the complete set of the predictive models. Increasing the zeta potential negativity of the latex particles or enhancing the membrane surface hydrophilicity resulted in a significant increase in the cumulative permeate flux, a substantial decrease in the total mass of fouling, and a noticeable decrease in the specific power consumption. Also, lower membrane fouling, higher volumetric permeate flux and lower specific power consumption were obtained by increasing the solution pH. At given 173

transmembrane pressure, feed solid concentration and pH, increasing the feed flow rate resulted in a reduced total mass of fouling while the specific power consumption increased. On the other hand, increase in the pH from 7 to 12 lead to a decrease in the total mass of fouling and the specific power consumption. A combination of an increased feed flow rate and a higher solution pH was shown to enhance both the permeate flux and the specific power consumption with less membrane fouling.  The LAS, an anionic surfactant, was found to be an ineffective pre-treatment for fouling remediation of latex solution using hydrophilic membranes even at high concentrations and long treatment times. Nevertheless, the LAS addition to the latex solution had an overall positive effect on the enhancement of the surface charge of the PVDF hydrophobic membrane from -2.50 to -28.66 mV through the ultrafiltration process. The optimum time was determined as 15 minutes of LAS addition at the concentration of 0.0001 g/L as a feed pretreatment. The feed pretreatment based on increasing the solution alkalinity to pH of 11 enhanced the PVDF surface charge more than the addition of 0.0001 g/L of LAS, in addition to a noticeable effect of higher pH on the latex particle negativity enhancement. The total mass of fouling was decreased by 29.6 % and 12.8%, in the case of the feed pretreatment by pH increase to value of 11, and the addition of 0.0001 g/L LAS, respectively. While the specific power consumption was decreased by 88.1% and 34.2 %, in case of the feed pretreatment by pH change, and in the instance of LAS addition, respectively.  The optimum enhancement of Ultrafilic and PVDF membrane surface hydrophilicity was achieved with the LAS treatments at a concentration of 1x10-4 g/L. The optimal time for LAS treatment was 15 and 20 minutes for Ultrafilic and PVDF membranes, respectively. The treated PVDF membrane surface with anionic surfactants at a concentration of 0.0001 g/L, yielded better performance than that obtained from feed pre-treatment by pH change. As such, the total mass of fouling decreased by 44.0 % and 29.6 %, in case of treated membrane surface with anionic surfactant, and treated the latex solution feed at pH of 11, respectively. Moreover, the specific power consumption was substantially decreased by 92.1 % and 88.1 %, in case of treated membrane surface with anionic surfactant, and treated latex solution feed at pH of 11, respectively. Moreover, the LAS treatment of the membrane surface at a concentration of 0.0001 g/L had much more desirable effect than the addition of LAS to the latex solution as a feed pretreatment before ultrafiltration using PVDF and Ultrafilic 174

membranes. However, the LAS was found to be an ineffective treatment either for latex solution treatment or enhancement of the surface hydrophilicity for Polysulfone membranes.  CTAB, a cationic surfactant, played a critical role in enhancing the latex particles aggregation, which resulted in elimination of the particles of the fine size range. As a consequence, the mass of fouling contributing to pore blocking and the irreversible fouling were significantly reduced. The optimum results occurred with the addition of CTAB at the critical micelle concentration of 0.36 g/L for 10 minutes with minimal agitation. Also, CTAB was found to be an effective pretreatment of latex solution using untreated homogeneous and heterogeneous membranes.  For Polysulfone membrane, CTAB at CMC concentration with minimal agitation to the simulated latex effluent was the best treatment for minimizing membrane fouling and enhancing ultrafiltration performance. For hydrophobic PVDF membrane, CTAB at CMC concentration of 0.36 g/L with minimal agitation had an overall favorable effect as feed pretreatment, as compared to the anionic surfactant LAS. However, enhancing the PVDF membrane surface hydrophilicty using LAS concentration of 0.0001 g/L for two hours facilitated a significant reduction in membrane fouling and power consumption, in comparison to the addition of CTAB to latex solution. 6.2. Future work Based on the finding from this study some investigations are recommended as follows: 6.2.1. Membrane Fouling Remediation Using Ozonated Membrane Surfaces in Ultrafiltration Processes The modification and post-treatment of membranes have become popular subjects for discussion among researchers. In comparison to other surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment, irradiation with gamma-rays, corona discharge, ion beam treatment, or UV radiation, ozonation is a much more inexpensive and simpler to operate. Moreover, the ozonation method can modify membrane surfaces uniformly even in the cases with complicated shapes. In fact, when polymers are exposed to ozone active peroxide groups are introduced onto the surface. Therefore, membrane fouling remediation using ozonated membrane surfaces in ultrafiltration of latex effluent is recommended. The influences of ozonated membrane surfaces on the total mass of fouling, cake height, cumulative permeate flux, and the specific power consumption should be investigated. The effects of different parameters should be examined, 175

such as: ozone weight percentage and/or the gas flow rate, application duration, and pH to obtain the optimum condition of membrane surface ozonation. The effects of ozonation in either gaseous phase or aqueous phase on membrane surface charge and the surface hydrophilicity should be also investigated. Furthermore, the effects of temperature on aqueous ozonation technique for hydrophilicty enhancement should be considered. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of the membranes should be examined with the aid of tensile strength and elongation tests. In that case, the impact of micellar-enhanced filtration combined with membrane surface ozonation should be investigated for further membrane fouling remediation. 6.2.2. Morphology Control Influences on Membrane Fouling and Fouling Attachments The key factor in the development and application of polymeric membranes is the control of its polymeric morphology. As a result, many of the researchers have recently investigated the influence of membrane morphology control on the membranes' performance. Findings from these studies reported that there were effects of morphology control on pore sizes and surface porosity. However, the reported studies only examined the methods used for the preparation of polymeric membranes as a way of controlling its morphology. The heat treatment was the only technique applied to the Polysulfone membrane flat sheets for morphology control purpose and enhancement of the pore size. These studies did not provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of morphology control on the membrane fouling phenomenon. Therefore, the effects of heat treatment of different membrane surfaces on the morphological characterization, including, membrane thickness, pore size distribution, and surface porosity should be investigated. The aim would be to obtain the optimum condition of the heat treatment of different membranes so as to attain the optimum required morphology with improved mechanical properties for optimum performance with minimum fouling. The effects of heat treatment on the membrane surface charge should likewise be investigated. The influence of morphology control on the fouling attachment, permeate flux, the total mass of fouling and its irreversibility should be examined. 6.2.3. Influence of Combination of Ozonation with Ultrafiltration Process on Membrane Fouling and Water Quality The objective can be to further investigate the feasibility of combining ozonation as the feed treatment and the ultrafiltration process in order to achieve and maintain a high and stable permeate flux, decrease membrane fouling, and lower the formation of disinfection by-products. 176

The ozone will be helpful in reducing the fouling of microbiological organisms associated with latex effluent, as well as enhancing the latex particle surface charge. Furthermore, the combined effects of ozone and ultrafiltration on the total mass of fouling, cake height, cumulative permeate flux, irreversible fouling, and specific power consumption should be investigated. Different parameters, such as ozone concentration and treatment duration, should be examined in order to obtain the optimum condition for the most favorable results with regards to the permeate flux, membrane fouling, and power consumption. The influence of ozone at different concentrations and various treatment times on the zeta potential of latex particles and membrane surface charges should likewise be analyzed. Notably, different membranes would be used for optimum results. 6.2.4. Air and Ozone Backwashing for Flux Restoration in Ultrafiltration of Wastewater Treatment Recently, air and ozone backwash have been introduced into membrane filtration in wastewater treatment. The ozone backwashing could effectively recover the permeation flux in the ultrafiltration process, and prolong the period that it takes to re-reach the membrane fouling if compared to air backwashing. This may be ascribed to the decomposition of organic foulants in the membrane pore structure due to the strong oxidation of ozone and the exfoliation of cake layer by physical force of backwashing on the membrane surface. The air backwashing method for membrane fouling reduction is believed to be relatively inefficient in the case of long-term operation because it acts solely through the physical exfoliating effect. However, both research directions did not provide a conclusive analysis of the irreversible fouling for scale up purpose. Therefore, it's essential to develop numerical models of irreversible membrane fouling including the backwash parameters that would allow for an accurate prediction and scale up purposes. Furthermore, the process parameters such as ozone gas flow rate and injection time would be optimized so as to enhance fouling reduction, increase membrane life time, and minimize consumed power and the total cost. The optimum condition would be obtained in order to enhance the membrane life time. 6.2.5. Spacer Geometry Influence on Membrane Fouling and Modelling of Feed Flow in Ultrafiltration Process using Computational Fluids Dynamics CFD The presence of spacers, which are the spaces for feed flow in rectangular filtration units, leads to increased pressure drop, and improved permeate flux. The hydrodynamics allow for the increase of shear stress near the membrane surface, which in turn improves the filtration process. 177

However, larger spacers lead to the formation of localized stagnation or dead zones, where the membrane fouling phenomena may be increased. As a consequence, it's essential to investigate the influences of the feed spacer geometry on filtration performance and fouling, with the aim to determine the flow pattern and turbulence distribution using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Furthermore, optimum spacer geometry and optimum conditions would be determined for best performance, minimum membrane fouling, and minimum power consumption. 6.2.6. Gas Injection Technique for Flux Enhancement Recent studies indicate that gas injection enhances the shear rate and reduces the concentration polarization in filtration processes. The formation of bubbles through gas injection has a positive effect and increases turbulence leading to flux enhancement. However, none of these research studies give a comprehensive understanding of gas injection's influence on fouling phenomenon. Therefore, gas injection would be introduced into the cross-flow filtration unit and investigate the influence of gas injection rate on the attachment of foulants to the membrane surface, flux improvement, total fouling, and cake height. Moreover, the attachment models will be developed to include the gas flow rate in addition to the feed flow rate, feed concentration, transmembrane pressure, and surface charge for a more accurate prediction of fouling attachments.

LIST OF APPENDICES APPENDIX A HERMIA MODEL FOR CONSTANT FLUX
Hermia (1982) developed four empirical models that correspond to four basic types of fouling: complete blocking, intermediate blocking, standard blocking and cake layer formation. The mode of fouling depends on the size of particles either larger or smaller than the pore size of the membrane used. In the complete blocking mode, the particles are larger than the pore size of the membrane used. These particles adsorbed onto the membrane surface. In the intermediate blocking mode, the particles are of similar size to the pore size of the membrane, causing obstruction of the pores. There is also a reduction of the pore size of the pores where there is a buildup of particles near the pore entrance. Typically, it is assumed that the particles are chemically adsorbed to the surface, and particles arriving to the membrane were blocked by already adsorbed particles. Standard blocking involves particles smaller than the membrane pore size. Here, the particles adsorb onto the walls of pores, essentially, restricting the flow through them. These modes of fouling are considered pore-blocking and are usually irreversible. The final mode of fouling considered by Hermia's models is the formation of a cake layer. Particles involved in the cake layer may be larger or smaller than the membrane pore size, and is due to a buildup of particles on the surface. The consecutive steps in the membrane fouling process entail the following:     Blockage of the smallest pores by particles arriving at the membrane (complete blocking) Coverage of the inner surfaces of larger pores (standard blocking) Particles arriving to the membrane block some of the remaining pores, while other particles cover particles already blocking pores (intermediate blocking) Build up of a cake layer (cake formation) The parameters considered by these models have a physical meaning and contribute to the comprehension of the mechanisms of membrane fouling. These models were developed for deadend filtration and are based on constant pressure filtration laws

where t [second] and V [m3] are the filtration time and cumulative permeate volume, respectively, and k and n are two model parameters with varying values or dimensions. n is a dimensionless number that is related to the fouling mechanism as introduced later; t and V are obtained from constant pressure filtration experiments. Schematic diagrams of the four fouling modes proposed by Hermia are presented in Figure (2.4). However, most low pressure membrane filtration systems nowadays are designed and operated in the constant flow mode, which considered a limitation of the original model developed by Hermia. In this case, (dt/dV) is constant, and the secondary derivative d2t/dV2 becomes zero. Therefore, the abov ementioned original form of Hermia model becomes invalid. In order to apply the model to constant flow filtration, the basic expressions of the model has to be revised by integrating the constant flow condition (Huang et al., 20008). A.1. Complete Pore Blocking: Complete pore blocking occurs when all particles reaching the membrane only participate in the sealing of membrane pores as illustrated in Figure (2.4 a). This idealized condition assumes that none of the particles are situated on top of other particles (i.e., no cake layer formation) or on the solid area of the membrane surface between pores. Therefore, the area of membrane surfaces with open pores (At , m2) decreases linearly with the number of particles reaching the membrane with the projected area of the particles on the membrane surface (Ap, m2). For a given particle suspension, the latter can be expressed as

Ap =  mf

Equation (A.2)

where mf [kg] is the mass of particles that attach to membrane surfaces and cause fouling, and  [m2/kg] is the projected area of these particles on the membrane surface normalized to a unit mass of particles .At can be expressed as:

At = Ao - Ap = Ao - mf
where Ao is the initial pore area of the membrane. Hence,
At 

Equation (A.3)

= -

Equation (A.4)

The transmembrane pressure required to drive the permeate through the membrane (P, Pa) is related to the permeate flowrate (Q , m3/ s) and At .It can be written following Darcy's law:
 A µ 

Q=

Equation (A.5) 180

where Rm [m-1] is the hydraulic resistance of the membrane. For constant flow membrane filtration, Q remains constant during filtration and P increases as a result of membrane fouling. The characteristic rate of fouling in constant flow membrane filtration is dP/dmf which describes the rate at which the transmembrane pressure would increase per unit mass of aquatic materials being filtered. It is related to the decrease of open membrane pore area as follows

Equation (A.9)

A.2. Intermediate Pore Blocking Model In the case of intermediate pore blocking (see Figure 2.4 c), each particle reaching the membrane may not only block membrane pores as in the case of complete pore blocking, but also attach to other particles that have already been on the membrane surface. It is assumed, however, that the fouling is only contributed by particles blocking membrane pores. This means that the existing particles on the membrane surface serve as competitors to membrane pores and reduce the actual number of approaching particles that can indeed block pores. Therefore, we only need to incorporate an analysis of pore blocking probability into the previous discussion of complete pore blocking. The probability for a particle to block membrane pores at any time is equivalent to the ratio of the remaining open area, At, to the initial total open area, Ao. Therefore, the decrease of the membrane open area as a unit mass of particles being retained can be expressed as (Huang et al., 2008):
At Ao

 = -  (

Equation (A.10)

Equation (A.10) can be written in a differential form:

 dmf

A

Equation (A.11)

Solving Equation (A.11) with a boundary condition of At = Ao at V (cumulative filtrate volume) = 0, we have:  = Ao exp (  Ao

)

Equation (A.12)

By inserting Equation (A.12) into Equation (A.6):

At Ao

=exp (-

The fouling rate in the case of intermediate blocking is thus obtained:
dP dmf

= ( )P

Equation (A.14)

Or
dP dm f

=  P

Equation (A.15)

Where  [m2/kg] is the projected area of these particles on the membrane surface normalized to a unit mass of particles. A.3. Standard Pore Blocking As shown in the Figure (2.4 b), standard pore blocking results in the shrinkage of membrane pores by particles attached to the pore walls. It's first assumed that the membrane consists of N uniform cylindrical pores with a radius of ro and a length of L. Next, it is also assumed that the radius of the pores decreases at the same rate as particles attach to their walls. Then, the following mass balance relationship is established to determine the effective pore radius after fouling (r):
2 N ( -  2 ) Lm =  

Equation (A.16)

With aforementioned assumptions, the transmembrane pressure of the membrane is invertly proportional to the radius of the pores following Poiseuille's equation:
8 µ    1  4

P=

.

Equation (A.17)

Consequently, the normalized transmembrane pressure is simply:

Equation (A.19)

Where L is cylindrical pores length and  is the particle density [kg/m3]. A.4. Cake Filtration Model The most widely used empirical model is the cake filtration model that focuses on the role of materials larger than membrane pore size. Unlike pore blocking, the cake filtration type of fouling does not involve any changes to the pore structure of membranes. Instead, the increase of hydraulic resistance encountered during membrane filtration is caused by the formation of a cake layer on top of the membrane surface (see Figure 2.4 d). The cake layer resistance, Rc, is usually expressed as (Huang et al., 2008):
 

 = c

Equation (A.20)

Where c [m/kg] is the specific resistance of cake layers. Again, by applying Darcy's law, we have:
µ ( +  )  µ 

P=

and Po =

Equation (A.21)

Since Rm remains constant, it is easy to obtain fouling rate by combination Equation (A.20) and Equation (A.21)
   µ c 2

Equation (A.22)

or the normalized form:

 

=

 

Equation (A.23)

The Unified Expression Eqns (A.8), (A.15), (A.19), and (A.23) can be written into a unified simple expression as follows:

 

= k 

Equation (A.24)

The meanings of k and n in different types of fouling are presented in Table A.1. It is noteworthy that the n values are the same as those found in the constant pressure model developed by Hermia for all types of membrane fouling. This indicates that the operating

conditions (constant pressure versus constant flow) do not affect the way in which membranes are fouled as long as the assumed conditions used to obtain the model are met.

APPENDIX C MODEL DEVELOPMENT FOR NON-UNIFORM PORE SIZE
MEMBRANES
In this study, a mechanistic model was developed and generalized for the applications with non-uniform pore size membranes, based on the fouling potential of the particles of different sizes with different pore sizes. The heterogeneous membranes have pore size distribution of (N) non-uniform pore sizes, as shown in Figure (C.1). Notably, the individual pores are not aligned in a straight manner, and thus cause the flow to take a non-linear path with the length of the path greater than the path equal to the membrane thickness, as shown in Figure (C.2). Consequently, the tortuosity of the membrane will be included in the model expressions. All possible mechanisms involved in particle attachments with non-homogenous pore

membrane using ImageJ software [ImageJ 1.46r, National Institutes Of Health, USA]. All possible attachments of each particle size are applied in the mathematical model for each pore size (). Eventually, the average percentage ( ) of each pore size () estimated by the software will be used in the model's calculations.

PORE SIZE MEMBRANES
The non-uniform pore size distribution of the heterogeneous membranes was estimated using the ImageJ software. The membranes consist of multilayers featuring pores in a non-linear alignment. The SEM images with higher magnification and set at random positions along the membrane's surface were used to ascertain the accuracy of the obtained pore size distribution. Figure G.1 presented SEM images of the heterogeneous membrane surfaces applied to the software. On the other hand Figure G.2 presented SEM image of the exact pores obtained using the software for the estimation of the pore size distribution. The pore size distribution of Ultrafilic, cellulose acetate, and PVDF membranes, are presented in Figure G.3. (a), (b), and (c), respectively. The Polysulfone membrane had ten non-uniform pore sizes, i.e. N=10, while the Ultrafilic, cellulose acetate, and PVDF had eight non-uniform pore sizes, i.e. N=8.

APPENDIX I STABILITY OF TREATED MEMBRANE SURFACES AFTER
THE ULTRAFILTRATION PROCESS
I.1. Stability of the treated membrane surface using pH treatment after the UF process

Polysulfone membrane has an original zeta potential of -42.40 mV. In part of this study, thirty experimental runs of CCC experimental design were performed at different zeta potential values of the membrane surface. It was necessary to check the zeta potential of the treated membrane after the ultrafiltration process in order to ensure the stability of the surface charge throughout the filtration process, as depicted in Figure I.1.

 [mV] before UF

 [mV] after UF

Figure I.1: The zeta potential of Polysulfone membrane surface before and after ultrafiltration process Polysulfone membrane zeta potentials of -10.00 mV, -20.00 mV, -30.00 mV, -40.00 mV, and -50.00 mV, were respectively changed to the average zeta potentials of -13.20 mV, -22.50 mV, -32.40 mV, -41.50 mV, and -47.60 mV after the ultrafiltration process. The simulated latex effluent had a pH of 7, which would affect the membrane surface charge during filtration. The zeta potential of Polysulfone membrane was -42.40 mV at pH of 7. It was observed that in the case of the treated Polysulfone membrane with a lower negativity, whenever the latex solution was allowed to go through the membrane for 25 minutes, the negativity of the zeta potential of 207

membrane surface increased by 2.00 to 3.00 mV. On the other hand, for the treated Polysulfone membranes with a negativity charge higher than the original zeta potential value, ultrafiltration of latex solution caused a reduction of the negative charge on the membrane surface from -50 mV to -47.6 mV. This can be attributed to the influence of the ionic strength of simulated latex effluent at pH of 7 on the zeta potential of the treated membrane surfaces at higher pH values. Similarly, Ultrafilic membrane with zeta potentials of -15.00 mV and -30.00 mV were also changed to -16.50 mV and -31.20 mV, respectively, after 25 minute of ultrafiltration with latex solution. I .2. Stability of the treated membrane surface using anionic surfactant treatment after the UF process On the other hand, the surface charge of the treated membranes using anionic surfactant was stable enough after the ultrafiltration of simulated latex effluent of pH of 7. As such, the surface charge negativity of the treated PVDF membrane was decreased only by 18.00 % from 40.90 to -33.27 after 25 minutes of filtration time, if compared to the significant enhancement of the surface charge negativity of around 16 times from -2.50 mV to -40.90 mV after the 20 minutes of membrane treatment. Moreover, the surface charge negativity of treated ultrafilic membrane was decreased by 4.60 % from -50.67 -48.34 after 25 minutes of filtration time, if compared to the increased surface charge negativity by 22.10 % from -41.50 mV to -50.67 mV after 15 minutes of membrane treatment.

Equation (J.1)

Where  is the standard deviation,  is the number of repeated data,  is the individual value of each repeated experiment, and  is the number mean value of the results obtained. The confidence interval used to express the degree of uncertainty associated with the data. The experimental run was repeated in order to verify the precision of the results with 95 % of confidence level of the normal distribution curve, as shown in Figure (J.1) (Douglas et al., 2007; Sheskin, 2011). Hence, the probability of observing values outside of this area is less than 0.05. The confidence can be calculated using Equation (J.2)
