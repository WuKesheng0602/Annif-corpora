BIOCONVERSION PROCESS OF SOURCE-SEPARATED ORGANIC WASTE FOR ETHANOL PRODUCTION
Doctor of Philosophy 2015 Valeriy Bekmuradov Civil Engineering, Ryerson University

ABSTRACT
Production of biofuel such as ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is a beneficial way to meet sustainability, energy security, and environmental goals. Lignocellulosic biomass such as source-separated organic (SSO) waste is particularly attractive since it is widely available, often at a negative cost, reduce the land depletion from using food-based biomass for ethanol production and reduce the amout of generated waste. Therefore, in order to meet the future fuel demands and cope with increasing volume of municipal waste this study was a first attempt to use SSO as a feedstock for ethanol production. The main objectives of the study were: a) to compare standard and modified celluloseorganic-solvent-based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) pretreatment of SSO waste for ethanol production in terms of enzyme savings, sugar formation and ethanol yields; b) to produce ethanol from SSO by using modified COSLIF pretreatment and fermentation with two different recombinant strains: Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416; and c) to develop experimental kinetic model capable of predicting behavior of batch SSCF on SSO waste with different SSO substrate concentrations using Berkeley Madonna program.

Based on the obtained results, it was found that SSO is an excellent feedstock material for ethanol conversion. The efficiency of modified COSLIF pretreatment was improved by 20% compared to standard method using ethanol washing of pretreated SSO samples during the experimental procedures instead of acetone. On average, glucose yield from SSO samples pretreated by modified COSLIF was about 90% compared to 10% for untreated samples. S. cerevisiae DA2416 outperformed Z. mobilis 8b on ethanol yields during the fermentation process, with 0.50 g ethanol/g potential sugar fed on SSO in less than 5 days, with a 96% cellulose conversion, totalling in 150 g/L ethanol produced. A kinetic model with newly integrated values of experimentally defined SSO feedstock constants was proven to predict the ethanol yield accurately with substrate concentration ranges of 20 g/L - 50 g/L. Model prediction at higher substrate concentration (e.g. 100 g/L) deviated from the experimental values, suggesting that ethanol inhibition is a major factor in bioethanol conversion.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Biofuel from Lignocellulosic Conversion Over the last century as the world population has grown and more countries have become industrialized, energy consumption has increased steadily. Therefore, there is a great interest in exploring alternative energy sources. Unlike fossil fuel, ethanol is a renewable energy source produced via fermentation of sugars from various biomasses. Nowadays, ethanol is produced from both: food based biomass such as corn/sugarcane/wheat (Shen et al., 2012; Ferreira et al., 2014; Mohagheghi et al., 2015), and non-food based materials such as lignocellulosic biomass (Wyman and Yang, 2009; Zhao et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2015). Ethanol production using the current corn/starch based technology may not be practical because corn production for ethanol will compete with food for the limited agricultural land needed. Therefore, a potential source for low-cost ethanol is to utilize lignocellulosic biomass. Common examples of lignocellulosic biomass include energy crop, waste from agriculture and forest products, industries, and municipal waste. Unprocessed lignocellulosic biomass typically contains the order of 35%-50% cellulose, 20%-35% hemicellulose, and 15%-20% lignin plus extractives and ash (Wyman, 1999). Figure 1.1 shows main constituents of lignocellulosic biomass in which cellulose is the primary component. The backbone of cellulose consists of D-glucose subunits bonded by -1-4 linkages. This structure is stabilized by inter-chain hydrogen bonding between the G-3 hydroxyl and the oxygen in the pyranose ring. Hemicellulose, on the other hand, consists of branched chains of several sugar subunits such as xylose, mannose, arabonose, and galactose. It bonds to the cellulose and lignin molecules through covalent and hydrogen bonds (Fan et al., 1987).

Lignin is a very complex aromatic polymer composed of polyphenolic compounds arranged in branched chains. Lignin intermixes with cellulose and hemicellulose to form a matrix in the plant cell wall, providing strength to the plant and increasing its resistance to biodegradation (Wiselogel et al., 1996). Lignin from biomass can also be gasified to release the heat value contained to provide energy needed for conversion processes (Johansson et al., 1993). Extensive research has been completed in the past on conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol (Dale et al., 1984; Cadoche and Lopez, 1989; Duff and Murray, 1996; Wright, 1998; Zhang and Lynd, 2010; Sathitsuksanoh et al., 2012; Bayens et al., 2014). As

shown in Figure 1.2, processing lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol usually consists of four major unit operations: pretreatment, hydrolysis, fermentation, and product separation.

Figure 1.2: Major steps in conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol

The effect of pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomas has been recognized for a long time (McMillan, 1994). The purpose of pretreatment is to remove lignin and hemicellulose, reduce cellulose crystallinity, and increase the porosity of the material so that hydrolysis of carbohydrate fraction to monomeric sugars can be achieved more rapidly and with greater yields. Although a variety of process configurations have been studied for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into an ethanol, enzymatic hydrolysis is deemed more competitive compared to other liquid fuels on a large scale (Wyman, 1999). Cellulose can be hydrolytically broken down into glucose either enzymatically by cellulases, or chemically by sulfuric or phosphoric acids. Hemicellulases or acids hydrolyze the hemicellulose polymer to release its component sugars. Glucose, galactose, mannose, and six carbon sugars are readily fermented to ethanol by many naturally occuring organisms. On other

hand, only very few native strains ferment five carbon sugars such as xylose and arabinose and usually at relatively low yields. Xylose and arabinose generally comprise a significant fraction of hardwoods, agricultural residues, and grasses. Table 1.1 summarizes the composition of most common lignocellulosic feedstocks. It maybe observed that typical carbohydrate contents range from 31%- 81% by dry weight, and they stand from cellulose and hemicellulose.

Table 1.1: Percent dry weight composition of lignocellulosic feedstocks Feedstock Carbohydrate Glucan (cellulose) % Corn stover Corn fiber Pine wood Popular Wheat straw Switch grass Office paper Source: Lynd et al., 1999 Cellulose and hemicellulose are potential sources of fermentable sugars (Ho et al., 1998; Taherzadeh et al., 1999; Sreenath and Jeffries, 2000). The presence of lignin in the cell wall, however, hamper enzymatic hydrolysis of the carbohydrates. The relationship between structural and compositional factors reflect the complexity of lignocellulosic materials. The variability in these characteristics accounts for the varying digestibility between different sources of

lignocellulosic biomass. In general, effective pretreatment causes disruption of these barriers and prepares for enzymatic hydrolysis folowed by fermentation (Lynd et al., 1991; Holtzaplle, 1993; Mosier et al., 1999). According to the cost analysis done by Lynd et al. (1999), among the various process steps, pretreatment and biological processing accounts for 32.7% and 39.6% respectively of total processing costs, which means that improvements are likely to reduce the the cost of ethanol production in both operational units to the level competitive with the cost of fossil fuels.

1.2. Innovations in Biotechnology of Fuels and Cellulosic Feedstock Production Biotechnology of fuels is a versatile field with a goal to develop an alternative energy source. It stimulates research for alternative sources of energy via bio-chemical conversion processes. General movement is utilizing substantial amount of lignocellulosic biomass readily available for little cost. The earth has a huge stock biomass covering wide regions including forests and the ocean. The total biomass of the world is 1,800 billion tons on the ground and 4 billion tons in the ocean, and a comparative amount of biomass exists in the soil (The Asian Biomass Handbook, 2008). The total biomass on the ground is 33,000 EJ on the energy basis, which corresponds to 80 times or more of the annual energy consumption of the world. However, it is difficult to know the amount of waste biomass production in each country and region of the world. Therefore, the waste biomass production is often estimated typically by assuming ratio of waste production relative to the biomass resources production (The Asian Biomass Handbook, 2008). An example of the estimation of waste biomass production is shown in Table 1.2.

The current stock of biomass is estimated based on waste biomass production multiplied by a coefficient of energy conversion. It is estimated at approximately 43 EJ for livestock biomass, 48 EJ for agricultural biomass, and 37 EJ for forestry biomass, with totals of approximately 128 EJ.

Approximately 22 EJ of dung of cattle accounts for the largest part of resources, which is followed by an approximately 20 EJ of log residue. Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to valuable biofuels has received the largest attention in past two decades and has concentrated on three main transformations: photosynthetic feedstock production; reduction of recalcitrance of biomass involving breakdown of complex components into simpler sugars; and end-product formation from sugars (Lynd, 2008). A number of studies indicate lignocellulosic feedstock could attain high yields (mainly in the form of ethanol) with positive balance in investment return (Lynd, 2008; Wyman, 2008). In Canada and US, for example, the goal is to provide more alternative greener fuels into the market and decrease the prevailing fossil fuel utilization. A conservative estimate places lignocellulosic crops at $50-$60 per metric ton (raw biomass), or converted to the price per energy value at $3/GJ, which is equivalent to the value of crude oil at the $17 per barrel (Lynd et al., 2008). There is a good potential for development of lignocellulosic fuels, but current implementation is still slow. This is because of the established corn ethanol alternative and due to retracted market for ethanol compared to gasoline (Bullis, 2013). However, there is a positive sign for a brighter future of lignocellulosic biomass, which eventually is expected to become a valuable product through government policy changes (Tyner, 2011) and improvements in new advances in the biotechnology realm.

1.3. Source Separated Organic Waste as a Promising Cellulosic Feedstock While today ethanol is typically produced from the starch contained in grains such as corn, sugarcane, and grain sorghum, it also can be produced from cellulose which is mainly
7

present in non-food products. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and it is the most common organic compound on earth, which may be converted into usable sugars for ethanol production. Cellulosic ethanol is a blend of normal ethanol that can be produced from a great diversity of biomass including waste from urban, agricultural, and forestry sources. Biomass such as processed source- separated organic (SSO) waste is particularly attractive in one context since it is widely available at negative cost and has many other benefits (e.g., good alternative fuel in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduces of farm land's depletion, diminutive of generated waste) and life-cycle settings. Generally, SSO sample prepared for this study is a blend of approximately 78%-80% of organic green bin waste 20%22% of construction and demolition waste in form of wood chips, passed through the thermal screw press (TSP) (Vartek Waste Management Ltd, 2005). A type of the woodchips chosen may vary (Sims, 2004; EUBIA, 2007) and can be any kind of woody or agricultural waste as presented in Table 1.3, which may alter the composition. The composition of biomass may vary depending on several local factors: 1) sorting criteria specified by the municipality for use by the households; 2) efficiency of the citizens in sorting properly; 3) collection system including the types of collection bags used in the kitchen (paper, plastic) and local storage bins (containers, paper sacks), in the so-called "green bin program", and finally 4) pretreatment that is used (disc screen, screw separator, or magnetic separator) prior to the biological treatment (la Cour Jansen et al., 2004).

1.4. Ethanol Prediction Yields Four approaches for biomass process configuration featuring enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation have been reported in the literature (Lynd et al., 2002): separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF), and consolidated bio-processing (CBP). Depending on the type of biomass/feedstock and process configuration (SHF, SSF, SSCF, CBP), actual yield of the ethanol could be anywhere from 60% to 90% of theoretical (Dowe and McMillan, 2008). According to Dowe (2009) the stoichiometric maximum theoretical yield of ethanol is concluded at 0.51 g ethanol / g glucose or xylose. Theoretical yield of greater than 90% from glucose is achievable by robust fermentative organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis (Chu and Lee, 2007). Currently estimated yields from cellulosic biomass are expected to increase as conversion technologies mature with greater flexebility to accommodate differenet feedstock compositions. It is clear that lignocellulosic biomass offers an opportunity for energy production but there are many social, political, economic and environmental conditions that affect the scale of this production. Since none of these conditions are static, there is unlikely to be a definitive calculation for the amount that can be produced. In the rough estimation, the international consensus summarized in the IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) that 100EJ Â­ 300EJ per year can be achieved from biomass by 2050 (Davis et al., 2014).

1.5. Selection of Microorganisms Microorganisms for ethanol fermentation are typically evaluated in terms of the following performance parameters: ethanol yield, inhibitor tolerance, substrate productivity, growth rate, pH, and temperature range. Currently, attempts to develop microorganisms are primarily focused in two areas: a) developing universal microorganisms that can utilize various sugars; and b) developing microorganisms for the specific processing configuration (SHF, SSF , SSCF, CBP). Generally, there are two strategies for developing microorganisms to enhance the range of sugars used. The first strategy considers microorganisms that can utilize different substrates. It is called the "recombinant substrate utilization strategy". The second strategy is the so-called "native substrate technology", which implies microorganisms that naturally use multiple sugars and enhance their ability to produce ethanol (Lynd et al., 1999). A number of different microorganisms have been employed in the fermentation of the water-soluble lignocellulose derived hexose sugars to ethanol. For the most part, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for fermentation. To overcome the concerns with pentose sugars fermentation, some researchers have explored the use of alternative microorganisms such as Pichia stipitis, Pachysolen tannphilus, and Candida shehatae (Jeffries, 1983; Hahn-Hagerdal et al., 1993). These microorganisms can ferment xylose to ethanol, but have low productivity and ethanol yield (du Preez et al., 1989; Hahn-Hagerdal et al., 1994a) and increased nutritional and aeration requirements (Dellweg et al., 1984; du Preez et al., 1985; Skoog and Hahn-Hagerdal, 1990). These microorganisms may also show increased sensitivity to ethanol, resulting in inhibition of both growth and fermentation (du Preez et al., 1989). Moreover, they do not metabolize the other sugars such as glucose as fast as S.cerevisiae (du Preez et al., 1986; Hahn-Hagerdal et al., 1994b) and maybe more vulnerable to
11

potential inhibitors presented in water soluble fraction (Linden and Hahn-Hagerdal, 1989; Delgenes et al., 1996). A series of recombinant S. cerevisiae strains that can utilize xylose have been developed in past decades at Purdue University (Moniruzzaman et al., 1997; Ho et al., 1998). Strains of S. cerevisiae are capable of high rates of ethanol production from a range of carbon sources, displaying high ethanol tolerance (Ingram, 1986), and increased resistance to potential inhibitor compounds (Martin and Jonsson, 2003). However, a main obstacle of bioconversion with earlier S. cerevisiae strains were an inability of microorganisms to metabolize pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose) into ethanol, especially from harwood and agricultural residues. Agricultural residues and hardwoods are similar in the way that they have lower lignin content and the hemicellulose produces significant amounts of pentose sugars. On the other hand, softwoods have a higher lignin content, which makes the hydrolysis step more difficult, but they generally produce less pentose sugars. More recent development in gene engineering has resulted inrelatively new recombinant microorganisms such as S. cerevisiae RWB222 and S. cerevisiae DA2416 avilable for biomass conversion with ability to utilize pentose sugars. S. cerevisiae RWB222 strain was genetically modified derivative of S. cerevisiae CEN, PK. Xylose utilization in this strain was achieved by integration of the xylose isomerase from Piromyces sp. E2, over expression of the native pentose phosphate pathway, and directed evolution for growth on xylose (van Dijken et al., 2000; Kyper et al., 2005). The isomerase is vital for S. cerevisiae to grow well on xylose under anaerobic conditions with high ethanol production (Maris et al., 2006). In another study, Suk-Jin Ha et al. (2011) have developed a unique strategy to coferment a mixture of xylose and cellobiose with S. cerevisiae DA2416 strain (derivative of S. cerevisiae
12

D452-2). They introduced a newly discovered cellodixtrin transporter and intracellular glucosidasefrom cellulotic fungi, Neurospora crassa (Galazka et al., 2010) into a S. cerevisiae DA2416 strain. It was engineered to ferment xylose with improved ethanol yields of 0.39 g/g from a mixture of cellobiose and xylose as compare to ethanol yields of 0.31-0.33 g/g from fermentation either cellobiose or xylose as sole carbon sources. These results suggest that cofermentation of glucose and xylose can enhance the overall ethanol yields and productivities. Along with the development of S. cerevisiae strains, a series of bacteria Zymomonas mobilis that can use xylose and/or arabinose were developed in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Zhang et al., 1995; Deanda et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1998). They illustrated the recombinant substrate utilization strategy. Z. mobilis is the native ethanogenic bacterium with a high ethanol yield. This microorganism can produce greater quantities of ethanol per mole of biomass produced due to the Enther-Doudoroff metabolic pathway. However, the natural substrate range of Z. mobilis is restricted to the fermentation of glucose, fructose, and sucrose, limiting its applicability for biomass tranformation (Lindsay et al., 1995). To overcome these shortages, engineered Z. mobilis strains were developed (Zhang et al., 1995). These engineered microorganisms were likely intended to be superior in lignocellulosic bioconversion, but commercial application did not take place. Among the further achievements were two engineered Z. mobilis strains: Z. mobilis 8b (Joachimsthal et al., 1999) and Z. mobilis AX101 (Kompala et al., 2001). Z. mobilis 8b was developed as an integrant of Z. mobilis ZM4 tolerant up to 16 g/L acetic acid and it can grow from pH 3.5 up to pH of 7.0 with optimum pH value range from 5.0 to 6.0 in ethanol production process (Kim et al., 2000). Its rival, Z. mobilis AX101, is capable of fermenting both xylose and arabinose effectively, with the yield achiviement of more than 80% of theoretical within 50 hours (Kompala et al., 2001).

In a new study, Mohagheghi et al. (2015) have adapted and evolved Z. mobilis strain 8b for enhanced tolerance to the toxic inhibitors present in corn stover hydrolysate. The adapted strain, named SS3, has a higher xylose utilization rate and produces more ethanol than the parent strain, providing foundation for future research directions in improving Z. mobilis for ethanol production and other fuel precursors. Based on todays' market availability and their ability to utilize glucose and xylose sugars from pretreated biomass in the fermentation phase, robustness and tolerance to inhibitors, two different recombinant glucose and xylose utilizing strains, Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416, were chosen for detailed study in the investigation of SSO waste for ethanol production.

1.6. Ethanol production and inhibitors In the study of ethanol production, many researches (Philippidis et al., 1992; McMillan et al., 1999; Lynd et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009) have identified and measured certain parameters: maximum specific rates, ethanol inhibitors and yield, pH, and temperatures. In most cases of measuring maximum specific rates, the initial substrate concentartion is kept low (below 10 g/L), so the effect of produced ethanol could be ignored. The effect of ethanol on maximum specific rate, Âµo m , is usually described by the non     =   ()  + 

competitive inhibition equation by van Uden (1989) as in the following: (1)

14

where

- measured specific growth rate under different ethanol concentartions;

- maximum

specific growth rate with no initial ethanol; S-substrate concentration; K s - Monod saturation constant;  () - ethanol inhibition function.

The first multiplier of the above equation is simply the Monod equation frequently used in simulating the exponential, retardation, and stationary phases of butch culture as well as chemostat steady state. It applies best to media processing a single growth limiting nutrient, an essential nutrient which runs out completely and stops growth before the concentration of any other nutrient has been reduced to a level which will affect the kinetics. During the course of fermentation process, ethanol accumulates in the broth to such extent that metabolic activities of microorganisms is supressed. Therefore, the presence of ethanol decreases the value of specific growth rate and equation above must be extended to include ethanol inhibition function,  (). The ethanol inhibition effect typically exhibit different patterns: a) linear kinetics; b) linear kinetics with threshold concentration; c) nonlinear concave up kinetics; and d) nonlinear concave down kinetics (van Uden, 1989). Several nonlinear ethanol inhibition were found and presented below in the form of the equations by different researchers (Dean, 1964; Aiba et al., 1968; Bazua, 1977; van Uden, 1989) to describe the nonlinear ethanol inhibition:

with those derivable for noncompetitive inhibition using the Michaelis-Menten equilibrium

van Uden (1989) has proposed expression for () in equation above, which is identical

approach to enzyme kinetics. Such expression, however lack accurate basis when applied to the growth of whole cells.
15

Equation (3) and Equation (4) below proposed (Aiba et al., 1968; Bazua, 1977) respectively are exponential models from experiments on alcohol fermentation with respirationdeficient mutant of S. cerevisiae, where the empirical constant  appears to be depend on the method of cultivation (batch or continuous):

Equation (5) below was suggested (Dean, 1964) to describe the kinetic pattern of product inhibition of the strain S. cerevisiae, since there was a nonlinear relation (concavity downward) between  and P. Equation (5) accounts for the influence of ethanol product, however, resulting values were quite different from experimental data. (5)

where P - added ethanol concentration; K P ,   , and

- ethanol related constants.

There are several other important parameters that have been identified in the studies for

ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. Among them arethe net rate of glucose formation and glucose fermentation, respectively by Zhang et al. (2009) as shown in equations below:

16

ethanol respectively;  ,  , and X - concentrations of cellobiose, -glucosidase and cell
 mass;  ,  / ,  - specific growth rate, maximum cell mass yield on glucose

  where  - maximum specific rate for growth on glucose;  - maximum ethanol

andmaintenance coefficient on glucose;1.053 - coefficient for water added during cellulose hydrolysis;  ,  ,  - cellobiose hydrolysis related constants; , , - related constants.

The rate of formation of xylose was described by an approach similar to that used for

glucose and could be found elsewhere (Zhang et al., 2009) as in the following equations:

 the maximum specific growth rate on xylose,  showed moderate sensitivity, while the   related to maintenance coefficient  ;  / ,  - maximum cell mass yield and maximum

17

change of the value. Meantime, the ethanol yield from glucose Y Eth/GL exhibits the highest

maximum specific growth rate on glucose, Âµmax Gl showed no sensitivity at all even with a 50% sensitivity, followed by ethanol yield from xylose Y Eth/Xl . Ethanol tolerance related constants

   , ,  showed moderate sensitivity. Also, sugar inhibition factors I 1 and I 2 and the

Monod constants K Xl and K Gl showed a low sensitivity during the SSCF experimental testing.

At the present time, several biological methods can be used to overcome inhibitory effects of aliphatic acids, furaldehydes or phenolic compounds on yeast fermentation in pretreated lignocellulosic materials. Possible options include detoxification of the pretreated material before fermentation by using available enzyme complexes to mediate enzymatic hydrlosis or use of the natural or targeted genetic engineered bio-reduction capability of the fermenting micro-organism which will detoxify the medium during the fermentation (Parawira and Tekere, 2011). The ability to degrade inhibitors exists in S. cerevisiae and other microorganisms and we only need to exploit or enhance this natural strategy to overcome inhibitors in lignocellulose biomass in some cases through adaptation and genetic engineering. The fermentation can be carried out in a process design such as batch or continues fed-batch that will allow for the natural reduction capability of the micro-organisms to be exploited. Adaptation (evolutionary engineering) of the fermentation micro-organisms to the lignocellulosic hydrolysate has been also suggested as an alternative detoxification approach (Martin et al., 2007). Although chemical, enzymatic, and microbial detoxification improves the fermentability of hydrolysates, it is desirable to develop adaptive ethanol-producing microorganisms that require minimal or no detoxification treatment. These adapted organisms not only reduce the detoxification cost, but also avoid loss of fermentable sugars (MartÃ­n et al., 2007). Adaptation has been shown to increase the ability of a broad range of yeast strains to grow in
18

lignocellulosic hydrolysates, resulting in increased fermentation rates and ethanol yields (Parawira and Tekere, 2011). Therefore to conclude, removal of inhibitors is necessary for achieving good fermentation performance even with newly recombinant glucose-xylose utilizing yeasts.

1.7. Process Governing Factors Evidently, inhibitors play a significant role during the fermentation of the sugars in water-soluble fraction to ethanol. Usually they are composed in one of two categories: process derived inhibitors arising from pretreatment (sugar, lignin from degradation products) or naturally occuring inhibitors liberating from the feedstock and recovered in the water soluble fraction (resin, acids). Inhibitors in both categories play a significant role in the fermentation process. Besides sugar decomposition, lignin is the greatest concern of the process derived inhibitors. Lignin can degrade under certain acidic conditions, primarily by the cleavage of the aryl ether bonds at the - and  - positions (Lai, 1991). Limited solubilization of lignin via sulphonation has been also reported (Clark et al., 1989) and made this inhibitor an indispensable contributer to inhibiton. The lignin derived phenolics have been shown to inhibit lignocellulosic fermentation, both for the production of ethanol by S. cerevisiae and 2,3-butanediol by Klebsiella pneumoniae (Nishikawa et al., 1988). Inhibition is related to the disruption of the plasma membrane as well as to the molecular weight of the compound, which affects its permeability (Ando et al., 1986). Removal of these inhibitors could be achieved by extraction with solvents to improve subsequent fermentation step (Clark and Mackie, 1984; Frazer and McCaskey, 1989). As mentioned early, the naturally occuring inhibitors are mainly of extractives origin. Biologically, many of these extractive components play a defensive role against microbes and
19

insects in protecting the wood from decay (Haygreen and Bowyer, 1996), and as a result, it's expected to be harmful to fermentation efficiency. However, as for lignin derived phenolics, the concentration of these compounds recovered in the water soluble fraction is often low due to its limited solubility and may not be exceedingly aleatory to subsequent fermentation process. Among the other important factors that play a considerable role in the fermentation process are pH value and temperature. These factors are well documented and understood in the literature (Lawford et al., 1997; Moniruzzaman et al., 1997; Joachimsthal et al., 1998; Lawford and Rousseau, 1998; Mohagheghi et al., 1998; Teixeira et al., 2000; Mohagheghi et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2008; Zhang, 2008; Lin et al., 2012; Tsuji et al., 2013). Study of Kim et al. (2008) identified a direct correlation of ethanol production and other factors including pH and temperature in food waste. In their work, response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD) was used for the optimization of enzymatic saccharification and ethanol production. A combination of factors generating a certain optimum response can be identified. Optimal conditions, particurarly for fermentation, were reported as pH 6.85 and temperature of 35oC. Ethanol yield was obtained as 57.5 g/L under these conditions with a fermentation time of 14 hours. Experimental results were in close agreement with the model prediction and statistical validity. Other comparison study (Zhang, 2008) reported a good performance of strain Z. mobilis 8b over strain S. cerevisiae RWB222 for SSCF configuration in paper sludge experiments yielding more than 0.38 g/L of ethanol under anaerobic conditions. Table 1.4 outlines some data of this study.

Results showed paper sludge SSCF by Z. mobilis 8b had a much higher ethanol yield at 30oC than 37oC to the better consumption of residual sugar, and higher final glucan and xylan conversion. Yet, paper sludge SSCF by S. cerevisiae RWB222 had a higher ethanol yield at 37oC than 30oC, apparently due to enzymatic activity at a higher temperature. It was also concluded that the best ethanol productivity could be achieved at the temperature between 30oC and 37oC with a pH value between 5.0 and 6.0, which support good growth and utilization ability of Z. mobilis 8b strain.
21

The influence factors such as temperature, substrate concentration and pH affecting ethanol fermentation using S. cerevisiae BY4742 was demonstrated in Lin et al. (2012) study. Fermentation of sugar by S. cerevisiae BY4742 for production of ethanol in a batch experiments was conducted to improve the performance of the fermentation process. Experimental results revealed that the cellsmass increased exponentially at the beginning of incubation,then entered a stationary phase after several days incubation, for different operating temperatures from 20oC to 50oC. Higher temperatures made the exponential growth of the cellsmass shorter. In their study, cell growth and ethanol production declined considerably at 50oC, which showed the inhibition effect on cell growth at higher temperatures. They explained that the high temperature results in changing the transport activity or saturation level of soluble compounds and solvents in the cells, which might increase the accumulation of toxins including ethanol inside the cells. In the case of substrate concentrations, they found that higher substrate concentration may achieve higher ethanol production, but a longer incubation time was required for higher initial glucose concentration above 80 kg/m3at a temperature of 30oC. However, with glucose concentration of 300 kg/m3, the ethanol conversion efficiency is decreased considerably (13.7% versus 59.9% for 80 kg/m3), since the higher substrate and production concentrations may have inhibited the process of ethanol fermentation. In addition to temperature and substrate concentration, pH is also a key factor that affects on fermentation process for ethanol production. Lin et al. (2012) found that the pH range of 4.0 5.0 maybe regarded as the operational limit for the anaerobic ethanol production process. Beyond this range, the formation of by-products, such as acetic and butyric acids may have consumed some of the substrate and reduced the efficiency of fermentation process. Therefore, a robust tolerant yeast is desired to maintain a high ethanol yield with increased substrate loadings
22

in fermentation phase. Eventually, it will lead to reduction of the amount of enzymes used in pretreatment and enzymatic hydrosis phase, often accounting for up to 40% of the total processing cost (Zhu et al., 2009). Moreover, it greatly affects the downstream cost of fermentation.

CHAPTER 2. THESIS OBJECTIVES AND AUTHORSHIP
2.1. Thesis Objectives Since the middle of the 70's, significant research and development has brought about numerous research groups for the improvement of lignocellulosic bioconversion to ethanol. However, currently, there is still limited commercialization of a process that can produce the "potential transportation fuel of the future" (Lynd et al., 1996). Most agreed that the present state economy of lignocellulosic ethanol still does not allow commercial production (Banerjee et al., 2010; Zhoa et al., 2012; Baeyens et al., 2015). This is further complicated by the global fluctuations of gasoline prices in recent year. Bioconverison of lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol and other energy value products is regarded as a very complicated process. Nevertheless, clean, renewable energy is always a worthwhile pursuit. There is a great need of continued breakthroughs in advanced technology to achieve this goal. The current project was initiated at Ryerson University, Toronto, Canadato confirm that various sources of biomass from construction/demolition, organic "green bin" wastes, agricultural and forestry residues can be pre-processed to change the characteristics of biomass. Thereafter, the pretreated biomass can be fermented into alcohols and converted into other useful products such as ethanol, chemicals and gases. This study will lead to the development of an efficient method utilizing non-food-based biomass (e.g. municipal solid waste) to produce ethanol in much more sustainable ways than current practices, which utilize food-based biomass such as corn, sugarcane and wheat more commonly.

24

The main objective of this research is to investigate the bioconversion process of pretreated source separated organic (SSO) waste by separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) processing approach for ethanol production. The solution is to use "pre-processing" technologies, including the thermal screw press (TSP), cellulose and organic-solvent (ethanol/aceton) based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) preatretment to fractionate lignocellulosic biomass and prepare it for further fermentation process with bacteria or yeast. Lignocellulosic biomass such as pre-processed SSO waste is particularly attractive since it is widely available, often at negative or low cost and has a great potential for bioconversion in ethanol production. Specific objectives of the study are: a) verify pretreatment technologies, such as thermo screw press and COSLIF; b) evaluate the performance of the COSLIF pretreatment on SSO feedstock for ethanol production; c) compare the growth and fermentation performances of pretreated SSO waste on ethanol production of two glucose/xylose utilizing strains: Zymomonas mobilis 8b and Saccharamyces cerevisiae DA2416; and d) interpolate new data of SSO

feedstock into an existing kinetic model capable in predicting its behaviour under specified conditions. Figure 2.1 below shows the structure of this thesis which is made up from 3 journal papers published to achieve the specific objectives. The thermal screw press (TSP) machine is chosen to be used in this study for processing biomass in a new unique way such that the feedstock is exposed to crushing, mixing, homogenizing, granulating, cell decomposition, compacting, heat generating and moisture reduction, all in one step. Compressed products such as peat log, wood chips/briquettes, fertilizer sticks can be extruded and formed into various shapes based on die design. The machine is able to densify on a continuous basis and extrude product in most cases without the need of binders.
25

Figure 2.1: Structure and objectives of the study

Among different types of pretreatment technologies, COSLIF pretreatment is adapted in this work due to its impressive glucose yield (approximately 90%), obtained from our preliminary testing (Bekmuradov et al., 2014). COSLIF pretreated SSO substrate will be verified with those

26

from similar studies and will be further validated with performance of commercially available enzyme complex - Accellerace 1500 in the enzymatic hydrolysis phase. This study utilized pretreated SSO waste as a model substrate to investigate the SHF configuration with fermentation by two recombinant xylose utilizing strains: Zymomonas mobilis 8b and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DA2416, which are prominent recombinant strains that utilize xylose and produce ethanol at high yields. The above mentioned strains were chosen for a detailed study of SHF process configuration due to their robustness, ethanol yield, and ethanol tolerance relative to other xylose utilizing recombinant organisms that were tested previously under similar conditions (Zhang, 2008). This project is a first and potentially the only one of its kind to include process investigation, verification and mathematical modeling on SSO wasteas a feedstock for ethanol production from start to finish. Fermentation and hydrolysis kinetic parameters will be defined experimentally in this study. Major contributions to the scientific community from this study will include: the understanding of general waste composition from municipal waste streams; cellulose and sugar contents in SSO samples; pretreatment methods that work best for SSO feedstock; comparison of performances on ethanol yields by yeast versus bacterium; and elicitation of significant factors for process control and optimization in the bioconversion process. It is very timely research with useful application and implications not only in waste management and environmental pollution control, but also in energy sector, food crop, and economics.

Production of biofuel such as ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is a beneficial way to meet sustainability and energy security in the future. The main challenge in bioethanol conversion is the high cost of processing, in which enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation are the major steps. Among the strategies to lower processing costs are utilizing both glucose and xylose sugars present in biomass for conversion. An approach featuring enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation steps, identified as separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) was used in this work. The proposed solution is to use "pre-processing" technologies, including the thermal screw press (TSP) and cellulose-organic-solvent-based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) pretreatments. Such treatments were conducted on a widely available feedstock such as source separated organic waste (SSO) to liberate all sugars to be used in the fermentation process. Enzymatic hydrolysis was featured with the addition of commercially available enzyme, Accellerase 1500, to mediate the enzymatic hydrolysis process. On average, the sugar yield from the TSP and COSLIF pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was remarkable at 90%. In this work, evaluation of the SSO hydrolysate obtained from COSLIF and enzymatic hydrolysis pretreatments on ethanol yields was compared by fermentation results with two different recombinant strains: Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416. At 48 hours of fermentation, ethanol yield was equivalent to 0.48 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass by Z. mobilis 8b and 0.50 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass by S. cerevisiae DA2416. This study provides important insights for investigation of the sourceseparated organic (SSO) waste on ethanol production by different strains, and becomes a useful tool to facilitate future process optimization for pilot scale facilities.

5: Kinetic Model for Ethanol Production by Recombinant S. cerevisiae Strain onSourceSeparated Organic Waste This paper is currently under review in Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal. An existing kinetic model was adapted and modified to accommodate batch simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) process on source-separated organic (SSO) waste by the recombinant strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae DA2416. The model encompasses enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes with competitive uptake of glucose and xylose in both stages. Enzymatic hydrolysis was featured with the addition of a commercially available enzyme, Accellerase 1500, to mediate the process. Pre-processing technologies, including the thermal screw press (TSP) and cellulose-organic-solvent-based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) pretreatments, were applied on the SSO waste to liberate fermentable sugars. On average, the sugar yields, mainly in the form of glucose and xylose, from pretreated SSO waste by enzymatic hydrolysis was 90%. The kinetic model was tailored with experimentally-defined SSO parameters to evaluate the sugar and ethanol yields from SSO waste, and was found to predict ethanol production rate accurately with diminutive variance from experiments. Experimental results demonstrated that S. cerevisiae DA2416 produced more than 150 g/L ethanol, with ethanol yield of 0.50 g of ethanol/g potential sugar fed, in less than 5 days with 96% cellulose conversion. It was confirmed in this work that cellulose adsorption capacities along with hydrolysis rate constant have a high impact on sugar and ethanol formation. This study provides important insights for investigation on the use of SSO waste for ethanol production by S. cerevisiae DA2416 and the model is proven to be a useful tool to facilitate future process optimization for pilot scale facilities.

CHAPTER 3. IMPROVED CELLULOSE AND ORGANIC-SOLVENT-BASED LIGNOCELLULOSIC FRACTIONATION PRETREATMENT OF ORGANIC WASTE FOR BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION
Abstract This study investigates the performance of the Cellulose and Organic-Solvent-based Lignocellulosic Fractionation (COSLIF) method for the pretreatment of Source-Separated Organic (SSO) waste. An improvement on the standard method of COSLIF pretreatment was developed based on lower enzyme loading and using an ethanol washing instead of acetone. It was demonstrated that a much higher glucose yield (90% after 72 hours) was possible with this improvement, as compared to the original method, which yielded 70% in the same time frame. Evaluation of the enzymatic hydrolysate obtained from the modified COSLIF pretreatment was further examined by anaerobic fermentation with Zymomonas mobilis 8b strain. At 48 hours, ethanol concentration reached to 140 g/L, which is equivalent to 0.48 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass. This study demonstrated that the modified COSLIF pretreatment provides a substantial improvement over the standard method in terms of enzyme savings, glucose formation, and ethanol production.

3.1. Introduction Pretreatment is considered one of the most expensive processing steps in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass, often accounting for up to 40% of the total processing cost (Zhu et al., 2009). In addition, it greatly affects the downstream cost of operations such as
34

enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Additional costs resulting from inefficient pretreatment include detoxification, limited enzymatic hydrolysis rate, high enzyme loading, low product concentration, and complicated product purification. Therefore, pretreatment can be seen as a key step in limiting the feasibility of bioconversion. Pretreatment, together with enzymatic hydrolysis, is the central task of the entire bioethanol production process (Zhu et al., 2009). Evidently, all the lignocellulosic pretreatment processes experience sugar degradation and inhibitor formation. The shortfalls of the current leading lignocellulosic pretreatments can be mainly attributed to: 1) inefficiency in breaking up the orderly hydrogen bonds in crystalline cellulose, resulting in slow hydrolysis rates and low cellulose digestibility, which compromises the overall sugar yields, and 2) the presence of lignin and hemicellulose on the surface of cellulose, which is commonly thought to have the effect of restricting the accessibility of enzymes to the biomass (Zhang et al., 2007). Cellulose and Organic-Solvent-based Lignocellulosic Fractionation (COSLIF) is a promising technology, recently developed to overcome these problems. The COSLIF pretreatment is a technology that can effectively fractionate lignocelluloses into amorphous cellulose, lignin, hemicelluloses, and acetic acid (Zhang et al., 2007; Rollin et al., 2011). This technology has been applied successfully to a broad range of substrates from agricultural to industrial waste, with inclusion of organics such as: food, paper, cardboard, plastics and yard wastes (Zhang et al., 2007; Sathitsuksanoh et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009; Ge et al., 2011; Sathitsuksanoh et al., 2011). The COSLIF technology has many advantages over traditional lignocellulosic pretreatments, most notably the following: modest treatment conditions at 50Â°C and atmospheric pressure; minimized degradation of sugars; no inhibitor formation; coutilization of different sugars increasing potential output; high sugar yields; fast hydrolysis rates;
35

efficient solvent recycling; low usage of enzymes; and low energy consumption (Zhang et al., 2007). The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of two COSLIF pretreatment methods: standard and modified, on an innovative feedstock for ethanol production, namely, source-separated organic (SSO) waste. Due to its potential for high energy content and environmental implications, SSO has been proposed as a suitable feedstock for bioethanol production (Mirzajani, 2009). It was demonstrated that the overall process of lignocellulose fractionation with the use of cellulose solvent (phosphoric acid) and organic solvent (acetone/ethanol) as pretreatment reagents is effective in hydrolyzing the sugar content of the waste (Zhang et al., 2007). In order to successfully deal with the causes of the SSO recalcitrance - breaking up orderly hydrogen bonds in the crystalline cellulose chain and removing lignin and hemicelluloses from the surface of cellulose, a standard COSLIF process was modified by using ethanol washing solvent instead of acetone and lowering enzyme loading. It allowed increase in the concentration of glucose released after enzymatic hydrolysis and to achieve the highest ethanol yield in the fermentation step. The enzymatic hydrolysis performances of the original and modified COSLIF pretreatment methods were investigated and compared in terms of their glucose yield. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the supra-molecular structures of COSLIF-pretreated SSO samples for qualitative comparison.

3.2. Materials and Methods The SSO waste utilized in this work was initially pre-processed mechanically, under high temperature (of approximately120oC) and pressure (over 50 bars) with a thermal screw press to
36

form a semi- dry stable biomass. The thermal screw press (TSP) machine by the Aufbereitungs Technologie and System (ATS) AG, Switzerland, is a heavily built piece of processing machinery that fits into the dimensions of five meters by two meters by fifteen meters and weighs between six to seven tones, depending on the model. The machine has a twin parallel extruding screws, which run the length of the machine and pass through one to three processing chambers. These screws carry feedstock through a thermal friction processing technique created through the adjusting the friction plates that are located between the chambers. TSP is powered either by electric or diesel motors and can process biomass and other waste materials in a completely the way, such that the feedstock would grind, compress and create an effecton organic materials and carry out this function in one step. During the operation of TSP, heat is generated through friction caused by the forward pressure and turning action of the screws. Normal operating temperature run between 105 and 125 degree C and pressure varies from 50 to 290 bar depending on setting needs and feedstock origin. The flexible operating principles of this machine offers great potential for processing different lignocellulosic feedstocks (Vartek Waste Management Ltd, 2005). SSO samples were prepared as a heterogeneous substrate by blending approximately 80% organic waste with 20% woodchips from construction/demolition waste before pre-processing (Vartek Waste Management Ltd, 2005). Optimum Waste Recycling Systems, Toronto, Canada, supplied the biomass feedstock used in this work. The general flowchart of the experimental investigation is shown in Figure 3.1. It started with the SSO waste fed to thermo-screw press and to make it homogenous. After this, the SSO samples underwent lignocellulosic fractionation with the use of a cellulose solvent (85% phosphoric acid) and an organic solvent (either acetone or ethanol). The next step

in the flowchart above is enzymatic hydrolysis with the addition of commercially available enzyme, Accellerase 1500, to mediate enzymatic hydrolysis process and release all fermentable sugars available for further fermentation. Accellerase 1500 is Genencor's one of the innovative enzyme products, with a significant step forward towards more cost effective, commercial scale production developed for second generation of biorefineries. It has been proven that Accellerase 1500 could successfully hydrolyze a wide range of lignocellulosic feedstocks (Retka, 2009). Accellerase 1500 enzyme used in this research was supplied by Genencore Inc., a Denisco Division, Rochester, New York, USA, as well as by the Sigma Aldrich Corp., USA. Prior to testing, the SSO samples were oven-dried at 45oC -50oC for 72 hours following recommended practice (Hames et al., 2008). Five grams of dry lignocelluloses was placed in a
38

250 mL centrifuge bottle and then mixed with 40 mL of 85% concentrated phosphoric acid using a glass rod (see Appendix D for details on experimental procedures). The solid/ liquid slurry was placed in a benchtop shaking incubator at 150 rpm and 50oC Â± 0.2oC for 2 hours. One hundred mL of ethanol was then added and mixed well. After centrifugation at 7000 rpm at room temperature for 15 minutes, the supernatant was decanted. The solid pellet was then re-suspended by 150 mL of ethanol and centrifuged. The supernatant again was decanted. Next, the solid pellet was re-suspended by 150 mL of distilled water and centrifuge two additional times (Zhang et al., 2007; Dowe and McMillan, 2008). Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were conducted next in sequence in the chosen SHF approach in a benchtop shaking incubator. The separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) approach was used in this study to avoid interference of samplings. The procedure for enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis was adopted from a procedure developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and described in (Ehsanipour, 2010; Brown and Torget, 1996). After thawing, the treated solid pellet containing amorphous cellulose was neutralized to pH 4.8-5.0 by NH4OH. Upon diluting to 20 g glucan/L based on the 27% glucose content (Ehsanipour, 2010), the sample was then brought to 50oC before adding 30 FPU/ g glucan or 60 FPU/g glucan of Accellerase 1500. The incubator was set at 250 rpm to keep solids in constant suspension with the temperature of 50oC for 72 hours. Sampling was carried out at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours and glucose yield was measured. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, batch soluble sugar fermentation was carried out to determine the ethanol yields. The Z. mobilis 8b recombinant strain was chosen for its capability to ferment glucose and to produce ethanol at high yields (Mohagheghi, 2004) and was donated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado, USA. Soluble sugars batch
39

fermentation was performed in 250-mL serum bottles with 100-mL working volume and purged with nitrogen before being autoclaved. Temperature was maintained at 30oC-37oC and pH was controlled at 5.0-6.0 by 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH) as suggested by previous studies (Zhang et al., 2009). Each batch sugar fermentation process was carried out in triplicates on the pretreated biomass for both the standard and modified COSLIF methods. Concentrations of glucose in hydrolysates from the COSLIF pretreated biomass and ethanol from in fermentation broths were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Bio-Rad HPX-87P column quipped with the appropriate guard column. All concentrations were reported as per liter volume basis. Percent theoretical ethanol yield was calculated (Dowe and McMillan, 2008): % Theoretical ethanol yield =
[ ]-[] 0.51([]1.111)100

where [EtOH] f - ethanol concentration at the end of fermentation, (g/L); [EtOH]i - ethanol concentration at the beginning of fermentation, (g/L); [Biomass] - the dry biomass concentration at the beginning of fermentation, (g/L); f - the cellulose fraction of dry biomass (g/g); 0.51 - the conversion factor for glucose to ethanol; 1.111 - conversion factor for cellulose to equivalent glucose. Supra-molecular structures of the intact and pretreated SSO samples were examined by scanning electron microscope, as described elsewhere (Zhang et al., 2006; Selig et al., 2007). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that can be detected and that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is generally scanned in a
40

rectangular pattern of image, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Samples can be observed in high and low vacuum, and in wet conditions. A SEM was kindly provided by the Ryerson University Analytical Center, Toronto, Canada.

3.3. Results and Discussion A detailed quantitative assessment on the composition of SSO waste was carried out (Ehsanipour, 2010) and adopted for further investigation in this study. The SSO samples, contained 20% woodchips, were already pretreated by the thermal screw machine. The woodchips were typically Douglas fir wood waste originated from home construction furniture, flooring, cabinet, and doors. All sharp foreign matter such as metal needles, plastic and rubber wastes, and broken glasses were collected and removed, as much as it was possible. The dried SSO biomass was sent to MBI International, the Michigan State University Foundation, for grinding and determination of polymeric sugars content. The results are summarized in Table 3.1. It turned out that those essential polymeric sugars made up 41.3% in oven dried SSO samples, including: 27% glucan, 5.4% xylan, 5.7% mannan, 1.2% arabinan, and 1.2% of galactan, which were a good starting point for enzymatic hydrolysis followed by fermentation. It was found that the SSO samples were acidic (pH of 5.0-5.5) and had the highest content of the food waste, just about 80% of total waste of samples. Comparison between pretreated and nontreated SSO validated the high recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic fraction of biomass as suggested by Zhang et al. (2007), and which was in agreement with other works (Zhang et al., 2009; Zhu et al.,2009; Rollin et al., 2011).

3.3.1. Glucose Yield Results obtained from COSLIF washing (shown in Figure 3.2) with concentrated phosphoric acid and acetone reagent generated a significant glucose yield of about 70%, in the first few trials.

Figure 3.2: Glucose yields of standard and modified COSLIF pretreatment performed at 50Â°C for 72 hours However, acetone is a more toxic reagent and it is less safe to use than ethanol. The cost of using acetone is higher than that of ethanol and during the recovery of the reaction's byproducts more energy is consumed when acetone is used as the reagent. In addition, pretreatment with acetone must be performed under extremely stringent and efficient conditions due to the volatility of acetone. Ethanol, on the other hand, is less corrosive and can be easily recovered by distillation under milder conditions. Therefore, after extensive trials and investigations, some changes were made to further improve the efficiency of COSLIF pretreatment to obtain a higher
43

glucose yield. The major change made to the original standard method of COSLIF pretreatment was to omit acetone altogether and use 95% (v/v) ethanol as the organic solvent instead. Another was changing enzyme loading from 60FPU to 30FPU. As a result of these changes, the glucose yield increased to approximately 90% (Figure 3.2). Additionally, only 50% of the original volume of ethanol was needed to replace the acetone.

3.3.2. Enzymatic Hydrolysis Figure 3.3 shows the glucose digestibility profiles over a course of 72 hours for the SSO samples treated by the standard and modified COSLIF methods as well as non-treated samples.

Figure 3.3: Time trend of glucose digestibility from the non-treated to standard and modified COSLIF pretreated samples

High glucan digestibility of the pretreated SSO was accredited to drastic changes in the supramolecular structure of the biomass before and after the COSLIF pretreatment, observed by
44

the SEM in this study. Typical COSLIF pretreatment conditions were used, namely 50oC and atmospheric pressure with a pretreatment time from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the type of feedstock. Although diverse feedstocks showed great variations in enzymatic digestibility, suggesting that their different recalcitrant structures confer variable resistance to enzymes, the use of concentrated phosphoric acid at 50oC can efficiently dissolve them so to erase their inherent structure difference and result in an amorphous biomass with similar high-accessibility (Rollin et al., 2011; Sathitsuksanoh et al., 2011). As a result, COSLIF-pretreated biomass feedstock exhibited similar enzymatic glucan digestibility regardless of their sources (Sathitsuksanoh et al., 2011). When concentrated phosphoric acid was used as the cellulose solvent, it should be used at 50oC or lower to avoid extensive hydrolysis of polymeric carbohydrates and sugar degradation. The enzymatic glucose digestibility for pretreated COSLIF samples was calculated as described by Zhang et al. (2007). With high enzyme loading, 60FPU and acetone washing, the glucose digestibility of the pretreated standard COSLIF sample was approximately 70% as presented in Figure 3.3 above. With a lower enzyme loading, 30FPU and ethanol washing, it reached 90% digestibility after 36 hours. This suggests that by removing hemicelluloses and lignin barriers, there was an increase in accessibility to the cellulose change by the cellulobiose, while also reducing the competitive inhibition of xylan to endo-glucanase. Data from this study on the hydrolysis rates and digestibility were comparable to the range (90%-95%) cited in other scientific papers (Mosier et al., 2005; Wyman et al., 2005).

45

3.3.3. Fermentation Fermentation is the final step in evaluating the overall process of cellulosic ethanol production. The effectiveness of the enzymatic hydrolysis was gauged by assessing the potential inhibitory factors and effects of fermentation. These results can be found in the following section. A genomic DNA-integrated glucose and xylose co-fermenting strain, Z. mobilis 8b recombinant strain was used due to its ability to ferment glucose and xylose to produce ethanol at high yields (Mohagheghi et al., 2004). The microbe was developed and evaluated by the NREL on a broad range of agricultural biomass and can convert sugars to ethanol more rapidly as compared to other species. Besides the major changes during the COSLIF pretreatment process, some minor improvements in the fermentation procedure were also made and they undoubtedly affected overall efficiency of the final ethanol output. These improvements were as follows: a serum bottle with a crimp top was used instead of an Erlenmeyer flask with stopper for better air-tight seal; a flushing serum bottle with nitrogen was used to maintain anaerobic conditions prior to fermentation; a direct transfer technique was exploited to move concentrated Z. mobilis 8b cells from an inoculums tube to a serum bottle; and a growth curve was developed for the Z. mobilis 8b strain prior to fermentation tests which was important in order to identify the OD (optical density) range in the exponential phase of a curve. The OD values in the exponential phase were vital in determining the time to harvest the cells to start the fermentation process. There were two protocols that could be employed for harvesting the cells to start the fermentation process: 1) use of a direct transfer (10%) to the main fermentation bottle or 2) use of concentrated cells by centrifuging in a centrifuge tube and then re-suspending the cells in a hydrolysate before transferring it back into the fermentation bottle. The second protocol was chosen because the
46

inoculated seed media contained not only cells but also a large amount of glucose sugar which would be transferred into the fermentation bottle. Unless distilled deionized water (DDW) blank was created, this would result in false and inaccurate HPLC readings of glucose and ethanol concentrations. The high ethanol yield shown in Figure 3.4 indicated that very little inhibitors were present in the hydrolysates that were pretreated by the modified COSLIF method. Depending on feedstock and process, the actual yield could be anywhere from 60% to 100% of the theoretical yield. Achieving a high yield may be costly compared to lower yield processes that are often more cost effective.

Time, h

The ethanol concentration rate was calculated on the basis of sugars consumed as described by South et al. (1995), and it yielded in 132.1 g/L for the pretreated samples by the modified COSLIF method after 24 hours. At 48 hours, the ethanol concentration reached 140 g/L, which is equivalent to 0.48 g ethanol/g biomass or 94% of the theoretical ethanol yield. As
47

per this work, percent theoretical ethanol yield was calculated accordingly (Dowe and McMillan, 2008). Although the ethanol concentration for some samples seemed to be fluctuating from time to time, over 90% ethanol yield can be attributed to the high accessibility of the pretreated cellulosic materials and low presence of lignin.

3.3.4. Comparison with Constructed Sugar Model In a further series of experimental evaluations, enzymatic hydrolysate obtained from both COSLIF pretreatments by batch culture fermentation with Z. mobilis 8b strain were compared with constructed sugar model (glucose/xylose ratio as 5:1) in SSO substrate. In a constructed model, after 24 hours, 100% of glucose and 40% of xylose were consumed. While in the enzymatic hydrolysate, pretreated by COSLIF with ethanol washing reagent, the fermentation also advanced rapidly and 90% glucose and 40% xylose were also consumed, in the enzymatic hydrolysate, pretreated by COSLIF with acetone washing reagent, the fermentation advanced slowly and 45% of glucose remained unused in the same period of time. Low bacterial activity in the fermentation process of SSO hydrolysates may be attributed to many factors including: longer lag phase for Z. mobilis 8b strain as the adaptation time to growth condition, low growth rate on SSO hydrolysates, unavoidable contamination during sample preparations, lack of nutrients, and presence of inhibitors.

3.3.5. Qualitative Analysis As per qualitative comparison, SEM images of oven-dried SSO substrate before and after pretreatment were conducted in collaboration (Ehsanipour, 2010) and provided in Figure
48

3.5.These images show the appearance of SSO before grinding Â­ 1-1, after grinding Â­ 2-1, and after COSLIF pretreatment Â­ 3-1. Each pretreatment (physical and chemical) process changed the structure of the SSO biomass. Before the pretreatment, the plant cell wall structures of the SSO and cellulose fibers were clearly identified. The SEM images from 1-1 and 2-1present changes in particle size.

The image from 3-1 shows all fibrous structures completely disrupted after pretreatment, indicating phosphoric acid and ethanol washing not only disrupted all linkages among cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, but also disrupted the orderly hydrogen bonds among glucose chains. These qualitative images are consistent with the images from similar studies (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2009).

3.4. Conclusions The SSO waste samples utilized in this research were pre-processed by the thermal screw press (TSP) and further used as a substrate for all enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes.SSO has an excellent potential to be utilized as a feedstock for ethanol production due to its high fermentable sugar content, 40% - 42%. On the other hand, SSO has high lignin content, which is slightly above 26% per kg of dried feedstock emphasizes need for pretreatment. COSLIF pretreatments were applied for cellulose extraction. Results indicate the percent glucose conversion was considerable for the modified COSLIF method with significant glucose yield, just above 90%. This study also demonstrated and confirmed that the COSLIF pretreatment can be carried out on this innovative type of biomass with a relatively high percentage of glucose and ethanol yields, when certain modifications are made to the process: a) the efficiency of using modified COSLIF pretreatment was improved by 20% using ethanol instead of acetone; b) using serum bottle with crimp top in fermentation process instead Erlenmeyer flask with stopper for air tight seal; c) using concentrated cells during fermentation phase instead of direct transfer mode to avoid false HPLC reading; and d) decrease enzyme loading from 60FPU to 30FPU for cost reduction. However, there are still some aspects of the process that need further investigation. For example, biomass size reduction by milling or grinding is energy intensive and costly which will affect the total cost of ethanol production. The extrusion process alone could disrupt the lignocellulosic structure, which would enable enzymes to gain access and attack the carbohydrates (Alvira et al., 2010). Detailed investigation on ethanol concentration and yield is still required. It was hypothesized that the large variations of ethanol concentration in this study were caused by interference of samplings. However, this has yet to be proven.

CHAPTER 4. COMPARATIVE ETHANOL PRODUCTIVITIES OF TWO DIFFERENT RECOMBINANT FERMENTING STRAINS ON SOURCESEPARATED ORGANIC WASTE
Abstract Production of biofuel such as ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is a beneficial way to meet sustainability and energy security in the future. The main challenge in bioethanol conversion is the high cost of processing, in which enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation are the major steps. An approach featuring enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation steps, identified as separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) is proposed to eliminate this problem. The solution is to use "pre-processing" technologies, including the thermal screw press (TSP) and cellulose-organic-solvent-based lignocellulose fractionation (COSLIF) pretreatments. Such treatments are conducted on ground-breaking feedstock such as source separated organic waste (SSO) to liberate all sugars to be used in the fermentation process. TSP and COSLIF pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis were applied on the SSO to unlock fermentable sugars (glucose and xylose) for ethanol production. Enzymatic hydrolysis was featured with addition of commercial available enzyme, Accellerase 1500, to mediate enzymatic hydrolysis process. On average, the sugar yield from the TSP and COSLIF pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis was remarkable at 90%. In this work, evaluation of the SSO hydrolysate obtained from COSLIF and enzymatic hydrolysis pretreaments on ethanol yields was compared by fermentation results with two different recombinant strains: Zymomonas mobilis 8b and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DA2416. At 48 hours of fermentation, ethanol yield was equivalent to 0.48 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass by Z. mobilis 8b and 0.50 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass by S. cerevisiae DA2416.
52

This study provides important insights for investigation of the source-separated organic (SSO) waste on ethanol production by different strains and becomes a useful tool to facilitate future process optimization for pilot scale facilities.

4.1. Introduction Ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has a potential to be a viable replacement or supplement for fossil fuel, but the current cost of conversion is a major bottleneck for commercial application (U.S. Department of Energy, 2006). The price for ethanol remains as high as $2.75 per gallon motivating further research (Collins, 2007). By contrast the average price for regular, unleaded gasoline in the USA is currently hovering around $3.9 per gallon with expectation for it to rise even more (U.S. Department of Energy, 2014). It became apparent that in efforts to reduce the production costs of ethanol, improvements in several areas of biofuel production including feedstock, price design, and enzymes are required. At the present time, there are at least two methods of ethanol production from lignocellulose that are in advanced phases of development: enzymatic hydrolysis and biomass fermentation. Neither process generates toxic emissions while producing the end product, ethanol. The technology is relatively new and exists in pilot configurations where testing is ongoing. While today ethanol is mostly produced from starch contained in grains such as corn, sugarcane and grain sorghum, it can also be produced from cellulose which is mainly present in non-food products. Currently, lignocellulosic feedstock is the most abundant biomass, which has attracted considerable attention and is often a major or the sole component of different waste streams from various

53

industries including agriculture, forestry, and municipalities' wastes (Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008). Today's bioethanol technology has offered sustainable approaches to the problem with municipal solid waste (MSW) by focusing on utilization of organic fraction of solid waste and agriculture residue in order to reduce wastes and avoid conflicts between human food and industrial use of crops. Organic fraction of solid waste has given a new perspective to the industry by defining an innovative system for converting trash into bioethanol reducing the amount of waste piling up in landfills, while displacing a large fraction of the fossil fuels to power vehicles. Biomass such as processed source separated organic (SSO) waste is particularly attractive in one context since it is widely available at a negative cost and has many other environmental benefits. It provides a good alternative fuel in terms of green-house gas emissions, reduction of farmland's depletion, and diminutive of generated waste. Ethanol yield and productivity are the key parameters in the production of biofuel from biomass and wastes. The fermentation of xylose-to-ethanol is important in biomass-to-ethanol process since it can increase ethanol yield up to 50% (Hinman et al., 1989). Several strains have been engineered to ferment xylose to ethanol (Hahn-Hagerdal et al., 1993; McMillan, 1994; Mohagheghi et al., 2004). Among them are Zymomonas mobilis, Saccharamyces cerevisiae, and Pitchia stipulus. The first two abovementioned strains met the selection criteria which were based on several fermentation characteristics considered to be essential for biomass-to-ethanol conversion (Picataggio et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 1995). The purpose of this study was a comparison of the growth and fermentation performances of pretreated source-separated organic (SSO) waste on ethanol productivities of two glucose/xylose utilizing recombinant strains: Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416. The
54

feasibility of the SSO as a potential feedstock for ethanol production has been widely demonstrated (Mirzajani, 2009; Percy, 2009; Ehsanipour, 2010; Faye, 2010; Luong, 2012; Bekmuradov et al., 2014a). Before pretreatment, a compositional characterization of preprocessed SSO samples collected at the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada for a ten-month period was carried out (Mirzajani, 2009).

4.2. Materials and Methods The SSO waste samples intended in this research were pre-processed mechanically under high temperature and pressure by the thermal screw press (TSP) and then used as a substrate for all enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes. Moreover, the SSO waste samples were made as a heterogeneous substrate of demolished construction waste blended with approximately 20% of woodchips and 80% organic "green bin" waste and pre-processed accordingly (Vartek Waste Management Ltd, 2005). Prior to testing the SSO waste was oven dried at 45oC-50oC for 48 hours. The next step encompassed lignocellulosic fractionation by cellulose-solvent (phosphoric acid) and organic-solvent (ethanol). Five grams of dry lignocelluloses was placed in a 250 mL centrifuge bottle and then mixed with 40 mL of 85% concentrated phosphoric acid using a glass rod. The solid/ liquid slurry was placed in a benchtop shaking incubator at 150 rpm and 50oC Â± 0.2oC for 2 hours. One hundred mL of ethanol was then added and mixed well. After centrifugation at 7000 rpm at room temperature for 15 minutes, the supernatant was decanted. The solid pellet was then re-suspended by 150 mL of ethanol and centrifuged. The supernatant

55

again was decanted. Next, the solid pellet was re-suspended by 200 mL of distilled water and centrifuge two times and stored in a freezer for a short period of time (Rollin et al., 2011). Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were carried out with addition of commercially available enzyme, Accellerase 1500. After thawing, the treated solid pellet containing amorphous cellulose was neutralized to pH 4.8-5.0 by NH 4 OH. The SSO samples were then brought to 50oC before adding 30 FPU/ g glucan of Accelerase 1500. Both the pH value and temperature described were the optimum conditions for the Accelerase 1500 enzyme to mediate hydrolysis and release fermentable sugars as much as possible. The hydrolysis experiment was conducted in the benchtop shaking incubator. The incubator was set at 250 rpm to keep solids in constant suspension with the temperature of 50oC for 72 hours. Samples were taken for sugar content at specified times: 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours to measure sugar content. The relevant composition of the SSO was 33% (w/v) glucose, 19% (w/v) xylose and 3% (w/v) acetic acid. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, batch soluble sugar fermentation was carried out to evaluate ethanol yields by performance of two different recombinant strains: Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416. Soluble sugars batch fermentation was performed in 250 mL serum bottles with 100 mL working volume and purged before being autoclaved. Temperature was maintained at 30oC and pH was controlled at 6.0 by 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH) as suggested by previous study (Zhang et al., 2009). Compositional analysis of the samples in duplicates for ethanol concentrations was carried out at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours by HPLC. The metabolic ethanol yield, Ym was calculated as a mass of ethanol produced per mass of sugar consumed. The process ethanol yield, Yp was obtained by dividing the ethanol concentration by total sugar concentration in the feed medium.

56

The volumetric ethanol productivity was derived by ratio of ethanol concentration and time taken to complete fermentation (48 hours).

4.3. Results and Discussion Due to its potential for industrial application, the SSO waste was chosen as the substrate to evaluate the values on sugar and ethanol yields by fermentation using Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416 strains. Detailed quantitative assessment on the composition of SSO waste was completed prior to this study (Mirzajani, 2009), and the results are presented in Table 4.1. As seen in Table 4.1, approximately, more than half of the original sample is composed of moisture. Essential polymeric sugars in an oven dried SSO samples included: 33% glucose, 19% xylose, and about 9% of other sugars and 23% of lignin. These homogeneous samples with pH at 5.2-5.5 had approximately 80% of the food waste and a 20% of wood chips. Enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation experiments were next in the line to be conducted in sequence in the chosen SHF approach. The whole process usually takes five days to complete. The SSO samples pretreated by concentrated phosphoric acid (85% w/w) and ethanol (95% v/v) were hydrolyzed fast and glucan digestibility was found to be 72% after 24 hours and 90% after 72 hours. The high glucan digestibility seen in Figure 4.1 was achieved for the COSLIFpretreated SSO with addition of 30FPU/ g glucan of Accelerase 1500. This result was mainly attributed to drastic changes in surface morphology of intact and COSLIF-pretreated SSO samples. The intact SSO has obviously maintained its tight micro-fibril structure, while a COSLIF-pretreated sample evidenced homogeneous biomass as seen in our previous work (Bekmuradov et al., 2014a). The enzymatic glucose digestibility for pretreated

Figure 4.1: Glucan digestibility profiles for COSLIF treated and untreated SSO samples

COSLIF samples was calculated as described by Zhang et al. (2007). We hypothesized that almost all lignin have been removed from SSO waste sample during COSLIF and enzymatic hydrolysis phases. But it would be impractical to completely wash cellulose solvents out, as it requires a large amount of water. Negative effects of residual lignin on enzymatic hydrolysis may contribute to 1) enzyme adsorption by lignin, 2) obstruction of lignin on the surface of cellulose to that point when enzyme are not able to access cellulose (Collins, 2007; Zhu et al., 2009). In a separate series of experimental evaluation, enzymatic hydrolysate obtained from COSLIF pretreament by batch culture fermentation with Z. mobilis 8b strain, was compared with S. cerevisiae DA2416. Figure 4.2 shows the glucose and xylose consumption trajectories for fermentation of the SSO pretreated samples.

59

As seen from Figure 4.3 both strains exhibited almost the same value of ethanol yields based on sugar consumed (0.48 g/g and 0.50 g/g) and the process yield on the total initial sugar concentration was 0.48 g/g for Z. mobilis 8b and 0.49 g/g for S. cerevisiae DA2416 (Table 4.2). After 72 hours, glucose is completely decomposed, while a small amount of xylose remains. Results show the main substrate for Z. mobilis 8b is glucose, while S. cerevisiae DA2416 decompose both glucose and xylose. Therefore the production of ethanol is higher for the

S. cerevisiae DA2416 strain after glucose is used up. The significantly better performance of S. cerevisiae DA2416 compared to Z. mobilis 8b suggests a possible role of inhibitors other than acetic acid on bacterial growth in fermentation phase, for example phenolic compounds from lignin and etc. It is both well-known and documented (South et al., 1995; Rogers et al., 1997; Lawford and Rousseau, 2000) that ethanol is an inhibitor to xylose utilization by Z. mobilis 8b with ethanol concentration of 5.5%-6% (w/v) causing complete deceleration of the process.

In further fermentation assays with the Z. mobilis 8b strain, after 48 hours, 100% of glucose and 40% of xylose were consumed. On the other hand, in the enzymatic hydrolysate with S. cerevisiae DA2416, fermentation advanced more rapidly, with 100% glucose and 60% xylose consumed after the same period of time. The growth and fermentation parameters of this work are summarized in Table 4.2.

In summary, low bacterial activity in fermentation of SSO hydrolysate by Z. mobilis 8b may be attributed to many other factors, including: longer lag phase - an adaptation time for growth condition of chosen strain, low growth rate on SSO hydrolysate and lack of micronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus.

4.4. Conclusions The SSO waste samples utilized in this research were pre-processed by the thermal screw press (TSP) and further used as substrates for all enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes.

COSLIF pretreatments were applied for cellulose extraction from processed source separated organic waste. Results indicated the percent glucan conversion was considerable for COSLIF pretreated samples compared to untreated samples. This study demonstrated and affirmed that S. cerevisiae DA2416 outperformed Z. mobilis 8b on ethanol yields during fermentation process. However, a more comprehensive investigation on lignocellulosic usage with different enzymes and recombinant fermenting strains would be advantageous in biofuel field.

CHAPTER 5. KINETIC MODEL FOR ETHANOL PRODUCTION BY RECOMBINANT S. CEREVISIAE STRAIN ON SOURCE-SEPARATED ORGANIC WASTE
Abstract An existing kinetic model was adapted and modified to accommodate batch simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) process on source-separated organic (SSO) waste by the recombinant strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae DA2416. The model encompasses enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes with competitive uptake of glucose and xylose in both stages. Enzymatic hydrolysis was featured with the addition of a commercially available enzyme, Accellerase 1500, to mediate the process. Pre-processing technologies, including the thermal screw press (TSP) and cellulose-organic-solvent-based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) pretreatments, were applied on the SSO waste to liberate all fermentable sugars. On average, the sugar yields, mainly in the form of glucose and xylose, from pretreated SSO waste by enzymatic hydrolysis was 90%. The kinetic model was tailored with experimentally-defined SSO parameters to evaluate the sugar and ethanol yields from SSO waste, and was found to be able predict ethanol production rate accurately with diminutive variance from experiments. Experimental results demonstrated that S. cerevisiae DA2416 produced more than 150 g/L ethanol, with ethanol yield of 0.50 g of ethanol/g potential sugar fed, in less than 5 days with 96% cellulose conversion. It was confirmed in this work that cellulose adsorption capacities along with hydrolysis rate constant have a high impact on sugar and ethanol formation. This study provides important insights for investigation on the use of SSO waste for ethanol production by S. cerevisiae DA2416 and kinetic model is proven to be a useful tool to help facilitate future process optimization for pilot scale facilities.

5.1. Introduction For many years, the main source of fuel for human society has come from fossil resources, which are not infinitive. Lignocellulosic biomass, on the other hand, is a promising alternative to fossil fuels and is considered the only foreseeable sustainable source of organic fuels and materials available to humanity (Shao, 2007). For example, lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural residues along with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste is particularly attractive because of the low cost and considerable availability, estimated in Ragauskas et al. (2006) and Zhang et al. (2006) at approximately 200 billion metric tons worldwide. As a result, there is an increasing trend for biomass-derived fuel to provide a renewable alternative to conventional fuel for transportation sector. However, the current cost of conversion has been a bottleneck for commercial applications (Houghton et al., 2006). Among the strategies to reduce the processing costs are pretreatment and usage of all fermentable sugars present in biomass with technologies available on the market. Four approaches for cellulosic biomass processing featuring enzymatic hydrolysis have been reported: separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) and consolidating bioprocessing (CBP) (Shao, 2007). There are four biologically mediated events identified in each approach, and they are cellulase production, cellulose hydrolysis, pentose fermentation and hexose fermentation (Wyman, 1999; Xiao et al., 2004). SHF and SSF approaches are featured in many experimental designs for immediate and/or near-term implementation, while SSCF and CBP reqiure more research from deep-rooted problems in the process development (Shao, 2007). Chandrakant and Bisaria (1998) reported a major disadvantage of SHF was inhibition of cellulose hydrolysis by glucose, and as a result it
65

has not been possible to obtain glucose concentrations higher than 5.5% with this method. The SSF approach, featuring enzymatic hydrolysis and fermetation of hexose in one integrated step, considerably increases inhibition to cellulase by cellulose hydrolysis products (Wyman, 1999; Xiao et al., 2004) and is therefore limited in terms of process performance. The SSCF process is similar to SSF except that hexose and pentose fermentations occur in one step. Unlike SHF and SSF, the SSCF process offers potential for more streamlined processing and a lower capital cost (Chandrakant and Bisaria, 1998; Wyman, 1999) . Consequently, the SSCF approach was chosen in this work. SSCF has become more attractive with the emergence of new microorganisms that produce ethanol at a high yield from both glucose and xylose and reduce inhibition hydrolysis by xylose (Kim and Lee, 2005). The CBP approach has a similar prospective but requires a higher temperature in the range of 50oC and 60oC for the enzmatic hydrolysis reaction than SSCF. Moreover, studies on CBP with native Clostridium thermocellum was found to produce ethanol with significant amounts of acetic acid, with very limited ability to utilize the xylose from the feed (Demain et al., 2005). Normally the process design for ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass is initiated with physiochemical pretreatment to increase the exposure of substrate to enzymatic hydrolysis, followed by the biological conversion of resulting sugars to ethanol by a chosen fermenting strain. A recombinant strain S. cerevisiae DA2416,which is capable of fermenting both glucose and xylose to produce ethanol at high yield, was used in this work. It has been observed that S. cerevisiae DA2416 has by-passed common problems with glucose repression, by taking advantage of an efficient xylose utilization pathway. As a result, the available sugars

66

are utilized more effectively, key fermentation parameters, such as overall ethanol yield and inhibition are improved further for better results in the fermentation phase. A lignocellulosic biomass, made up of pre-processed SSO, which is a blend of approximately 80% organic "green bin" and approximately 20% of woodchips from construction/demolition waste, was used in this work as a feedstock for all enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes. Results from previous studies on SSO, including a 6-month compositional analyses (Mirzajani, 2009) and chemical pretreatment (Ehsanipour, 2010), have shown that SSO can become a highly desirable potential substrate with unlimited availability and often at negative cost for future industrial applications. An existing kinetic model was adapted from ( Zhang, 2008) and modified in this work to predict batch SSCF on SSO waste by glucose and xylose utilizing strain S. cerevisiae DA2416. This model accounts for cellulose and hemicellulose enzymatic hydrolysis and competitive uptake of glucose and xylose. There are only a few published studies on the conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose via SSCF (McMillan et al., 1999; Teixeira et al., 2000; Kim and Lee, 2005) and only one kinetic model has been proposed in the literature (Zhang, 2008). The kinetic model development was based on a semi-mechanic rate equation for cellulose hydrolysis as initially proposed by South et al. (1995) and further modified by Shao (2007) and Zhang (2008) to accommodate cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis. The parameters presented in the literature (Shao, 2007; Zhang, 2008) were based on data for paper sludge only. Therefore, new values of interest such as the adsorption capacity, enzymatic hydrolysis constant, ethanol inhibition and ethanol yield were re-established with experimental data to accommodate the batch mode SSCF on SSO waste.

67

The main objectives of this paper are: a) to study the influence of different process variables presented in SSCF process configuration on pretreated SSO waste with chosen strain, S. cerevisiae DA2416; b) to develop an experimental kinetic model capable of predicting behavior of batch SSCF on SSO waste with different substrate concentrations: 20 g/L, 50 g/L and 100 g/L; and c) to compare performance of S. cerevisiae DA2416 on ethanol yield with other yeasts from the same family: S. cerevisiae RWB222 and S. cerevisiae D5A. The overall objective of this work is to advance in the understanding and gaining knowledge for bioconversion process of converting SSO waste by SSCF approach for ethanol production.

5.2. Materials and Methods The S. cerevisiae DA2416 recombinant strain used in this study was kindly provided by Dr. Yong-Su Jin from the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Illinois, USA. It was kept at -80oC in 30% (v/v) glycerol for storage. The enzyme complex Accellerase 1500 used in the hydrolysis experiments was donated by of Sigma Aldrich Corp., USA. The SSO waste utilized in this work was initially pre-processed mechanically, under high temperature (120oC) and pressure (50 bars) by a thermal screw press for 4-5 minutes to form a semi-dry stable biomass (Optimum waste and recycling systems Ltd, 2010). SSO samples were prepared as a heterogeneous substrate by blending 20%Â±2% construction/demolition wood waste in the form of the wood chips and addition 78%-80% of organic "green-bin" waste as in (Bekmuradov et al., 2014b). Optimum Waste Recycling Systems, Toronto, Canada, supplied the
68

biomass feedstock used in this work (Optimum waste and recycling systems Ltd, 2010). Prior to testing, the SSO waste was oven-dried at 45oC-50oC for 48 hours. Chemical pretreatment with cellulose-organic-solvent-based lignocellulosic fractionation (COSLIF) was applied to release the glucose and xylose from the SSO (Bekmuradov et al., 2014a). Five grams of dry lignocellulose was placed in a 250-mL centrifuge bottle and then mixed with 40 mL of 85% concentrated phosphoric acid using a glass rod. The solid/liquid slurry was placed in a benchtop shaking incubator at 150 rpm and 50oCÂ±0.2oC for two hours. One hundred mL of ethanol was then added to the contents and mixed well. After centrifugation at 7000 rpm at room temperature for 15 minutes, the supernatant was decanted. The solid pellet was then re-suspended with 200 mL of ethanol and centrifuged again at 7000 rpm. The supernatant again was decanted. Next, the solid pellet was re-suspended with 200 mL of distilled water and centrifuged two times and stored in a freezer (Rollin et al., 2009). Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were carried out with the addition of a commercially available enzyme, Accellerase 1500. After thawing, the treated solid pellet containing amorphous cellulose was neutralized to pH 4.8-5.0 by NH4OH. The SSO samples were then brought to 50oC before addition of 30FPU/ g glucan of Accellerase 1500. Both the pH value and temperature described were the optimum conditions for the Accellerase 1500 enzyme to mediate hydrolysis to allow release of as much fermentable sugars as possible (Dowe and McMillan, 2008). The hydrolysis experiment was conducted in the shaking incubator (model MAXQ4450). The incubator was set at 250 rpm to keep solids in constant suspension with the temperature of 50Â°C for 72 hours. Samples were taken and measured for sugar content at specified times: 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. The relevant composition of the SSO was studied and reported in (Bekmuradov et al., 2014a).
69

The protein content of the SSO substrate was measured by a modified method of Lowry (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 2011). Adsorption of cellulase onto SSO substrate was done by mixing them in an incubator shaker at 100 rpm in the Innova-40 shaker, at a temperature of 25oC, in 10-mL glass tubes, under controlled pH and concentration of cellulase. Centrifugation of the reaction tube followed an incubation period, after which unbound cellulase present in the supernatant were decanted off. The amount of cellulase adsorbed onto a solid substrate was determined as the difference between the total amount of cellulase initially applied [E init ] and the amount of free cellulase in the solution [E non ads ]. The amount of free cellulase in the solution was measured by rapid UV spectrophotometer technique (Liu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). The technique determines free cellulase concentrations in the solid SSO substrate suspension from the second derivative of the absorption spectra at 750 nm wavelength through calibration. Each data point in the plots was based on an average of 5 replicates. The carbohydrate content of SSO was determined by quantitative saccharification (QS) based on 2 hours of incubation in 72% by weight H 2 SO 4 at 30oC (Ruiz and Ehrman, 1996; Moxley and Zhang, 2007) . The cell mass was determined by counting colony forming units on agar plates as described by Zhang et al. (2009). Following enzymatic hydrolysis, batch soluble sugar fermentation was carried out to evaluate ethanol yields from SSO samples as a result of conversion using recombinant strain S. cerevisiae DA2416. Soluble sugar batch fermentation was performed in 250-mL serum bottles with 100 mL working volume. Temperature was maintained at 30oC and pH was controlled at 6.0 by 1M potassium hydroxide (KOH) as suggested by previous study (Mohagheghi et al., 2004). Compositional analysis of the samples for ethanol concentrations was carried out at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours) by HPLC (see Appendix E "Samples of HPLC runs for glucose and ethanol").
70

The kinetic model adapted in this study uses a semi-mechanistic rate equation for cellulose hydrolysis as proposed by South et al. (1995) and further modified in Zhang et al. (2009). The parameters presented in Zhang's kinetic model were based on cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis for pretreated paper sludge. In this study adsorption parameters were re-established based on overall carbohydrate content of pretreated SSO waste. The binding capacity or specific capacity of the carbohydrate component for cellulase of SSO samples was obtained using Langmuir isotherms. The remaining cellulose hydrolysis parameters were as reported by Zhang (2008) . Experimental data on glucose and xylose consumptions and growth parameters were fitted using the non-linear function of Polymath 5.1 (Polymath Software: Willimantic, CT, USA). All other parameters were dynamically fitted with the curve fitting function in the Berkeley Madonna computer program with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm. Runs were performed on a standard laptop. A sensitivity analysis was carried out based on the least-square method (Stigler, 1986; Bretscher, 1995). It was performed to test the impact of the value of important parameters on the model prediction of ethanol production if the values were changed to Â±10% from those obtained from experiments. The analysis was performed to determine the difference between experimental data and modified kinetic model predictive ability.

5.3. Results and Discussion Due to its prospect for commercial application, SSO waste was chosen as the substrate to evaluate the values on sugar and ethanol yields by fermentation using S. cerevisiae DA2416 strain.
71

Approximately, more than half of the original sample was composed of moisture. Essential polymeric sugars in the oven dried SSO samples included: 31% glucose, 19% xylose, and about 9% of other sugars and 23% of lignin. These homogeneous samples had a pH range of 5.2-5.5. The SSO samples pretreated by concentrated phosphoric acid (85% w/w) and ethanol (95% v/v) were hydrolyzed and glucan digestibility was found to be 72% after 24 hours and 90% after 72 hours. The high glucan digestibility was achieved for the COSLIF-pretreated SSO with addition of 30 FPU/ g glucan of Accellerase 1500 (Bekmuradov et al., 2014b). Recognizing that cellulase mixtures contain a mixture of cellulase and hemicellulose portions which bind to cellulose and hemicellulose, adsorption capacity constant "" was recalculated using the modified method of Lowry and resultantly they were in the range of 0.264 to 0.280. Similarly, the binding capacity C S was determined as between 0.442 g protein/g carbohydrate and 0.466 g protein/g carbohydrate using Langmuir isotherms. Cellulose hydrolysis rate constant Â­ k (1/h) had range values of 0.662 and 0.725. The remaining cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis parameters were adapted from Zhang (2008). Adsorption of Accellerase 1500 cellulase to the SSO waste samples was evaluated after hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for specified time, (6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours) resulting in various values for fractional conversion up to 85% as shown in Figure 5.1.

The predictions were confirmed by experimental data obtained during the addition of Accellerase 1500 enzyme complex to SSO samples throughout the course of hydrolysis. The predictions over the time of reaction are almost the same. The good fit obtained in this study suggests that as for the SSO samples it seems reasonable to assume a constant adsorption capacity normalized to the amount of cellulose remaining and there is no reason to hypothesize adsorption affinity as a function of a conversion. Adsorption parameters K S and  S in Table 5.1 were then fit to the data of all conversions by minimizing the sum of squares for the predicted and experimental data. The new adsorption parameters with conversion data were used to fit the parameters k, c and e in the cellulose rate equation by South et al. (1995). The values of parameters are presented in Table 5.1.

With parameter values in hand for adsorption, hydrolysis and fermentation, a pre-existing kinetic model for SSCF was modified to account newly defined SSO feedstock constants. In view of this, we selected a simple correlation model reported by Zhang (2008) as in the following equation: (1) where and
- formation of glucan and xylan respectively, GI, XI - initial glucan and xylan

concentrations.

Equation (1) above describes the correlation of glucan and xylan hydrolysis and is derived from the simple relationship of X 1 =X 2 in which: X 1 and X 2 are the conversion of glucan and xylan respectively. To understand the enzyme hydrolysis performance with the S. cerevisiae DA2416 strain, the percentage of glucan and xylan conversion was calculated. Glucan and xylan used in SSO in this work were converted to monomeric sugars at almost the same rate by Accellerase 1500. The average glucan conversion to monomer sugars was 96%, and the average xylan conversion to monomer sugars was 94% at 30oC. However, we observed a slightly higher
74

residual xylose accumulation than residual accumulation of glucose during experimental tests. The slower consumption rate of xylose than glucose was consistent with the fermentation of soluble sugars in other studies as well utilizing S. cerevisiae (Kuyper et al., 2005; Zhang and Lynd, 2010). To begin SSCF runs, Accellerase 1500 enzyme at 30FPU cellulase were mixed with yeast innocula and added into the vessel to increase the sugar's accessibility to cells during the mass transfer limited period. High glucan digestibility (approximately 90%) was achieved. Batch soluble sugar fermentation experiments were carried out to find the fermentation related constants, exclusive ethanol inhibition and yield in SSCF kinetic model by performance of recombinant strain S. cerevisiae DA2416. In S. cerevisiae strains, there are a large number of genes encoding hexose transporters (Reifenberger, 1997), which are also believed to function with low affinity xylose transporters in recombinant xylose utilizing S. cerevisiae strains (Sedlak and Ho, 2004). Based on this examination, a competitive substrate inhibition model for growth in glucose and xylose by S. cerevisiae DA2416 was chosen to capture the growth kinetics. Inhibition of growth and fermentation has been described using different equations in the literature, including exponential inhibition, linear inhibition, and linear inhibition beyond threshold (van Uden, 1989). Among them, a threshold linear inhibition model was chosen because it fit best with the data. A threshold linear inhibition model equation (2) as described elsewhere (South et al., 1995) accounts for glucose fermentation with an additional term representing sugar uptake from xylose and inhibition from ethanol:

Values for inhibition factors I 1 and I 2 in this work were found to be 0.108 and 6.032 respectively, indicating that the inhibition of xylose utilization by glucose is more than 50 times stronger than the inhibition of glucose utilization by xylose. In order to test the SSCF performance on SSO feedstock with newly redefined constants, batch fermentations were carried out in a separate series of experimental evaluation at different substrate concentrations of 20 g/L, 50 g/L and 100 g/L with the enzyme loading of 30FPU cellulase.

effect of produced ethanol can be ignored. The model accurately predicts the sugar and ethanol concentration along with cell mass for 20 g/L and 50 g/L (experimental data shown with error margins) as shown in Figures 5.2, 5-3, but not for 100 g/L (Figure 5.4). In higher substrate concentration mode, reaction deviated from experimental values as shown in Figure 5. 4, suggesting ethanol inhibition is a factor causing this discrepancy. There are also other reasons attributed to it, for example, enzyme deactivation or enzyme adsorption by lignin and/or obstruction of lignin on the surface of cellulose to the point that enzymes are not able to access cellulose (Collins, 2007; Faye, 2010). Another set of experiments was conducted to assess the contribution of ethanol inhibition to the loss of cell viability. We expected good cell viability at lower SSO sample concentrations if inhibition was a major factor for cells lost. It was noticed in experiments that ethanol
78

concentration was a major factor of declining cell viability, but at the same time, one or more factors other than ethanol inhibition that were not yet determined might contribute to the loss viability in SSCF using S. cerevisiae DA2416. Table 5.2 below presents the results of sensitivity analysis. In the sensitivity analysis, the sum of variance between the measured ethanol and the ethanol predicted by the model were calculated. Single parameters were varied to Â±10% of the experimental values and responses S* were calculated as absolute values based on the leastsquare method (Stigler, 1986; Bretscher, 1995), where S* is defined as in the following equation:
  = 
2 -1  1

(5)

where V 2 - sum of variance between measured and predicted values from kinetic modelwith a single model constant changed to Â±10%; V 1 - sum of variance between the measured and predicted value with all kinetic model constants unchanged from their measured values.

As seen from Table 5.2, cellulase adsorption constant C S had the highest response value followed by the cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis constant k, among the enzymatic hydrolysis constants. From the results, a 10% decrease of C S is almost 3 times more sensitive than a 10% increase, demonstrating that increase in enzyme loading will be more effective than increase in substrate concentration for ethanol yield. Among the microbial growth related constants, the ethanol yield from glucose and xylose exhibited the highest sensitivity, with ethanol tolerant related constants showing moderate sensitivity. Finally, a comparison of the performance of S. cerevisiae DA2416 with different S. cerevisiae strains in terms of the ethanol production and glucan and xylan conversions are performed and the results are presented in Table 5.3. The results in Table 5.3 shows the highest

ethanol production achieved for S. cerevisiae DA2416 by SSCF on SSO, as compared to those by S. cerevisiae RWB222 and S. cerevisiae D5A as tested on paper sludge. Experimental results demonstrated S. cerevisiae DA2416 produced an ethanol yield of 0.50 g of ethanol/g potential sugar fed on SSO in less than 5 days with 96% cellulose conversion totalling in 150 g/L ethanol. All strains exhibited almost the same value of glucan and xylan conversion. Performance of S. cerevisiae DA2416 on SSO has a higher ethanol production, most probably due to a higher enzymatic activity and higher tolerance to inhibitors than other two strains. Although, different substrates, including paper sludge should be tested to validate the DA2416 strain in the future work.

5.4. Conclusions The SSO waste samples utilized in this research were pre-processed by the TSP and further used as substrates for all COSLIF, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation processes. COSLIF pretreatment was applied for cellulose and sugars extraction from pre-processed SSO waste. Fermentation results demonstrated S. cerevisiae DA2416 produced more than 150 g/L ethanol with ethanol yield of 0.50 g of ethanol/g potential sugar fed on SSO in less than 5 days. It was demonstrated that a kinetic model with integrated values of experimentally defined SSO feedstock constants was successful in predicting the ethanol yield accurately with diminutive variance from experiments. The cellulose adsorption constant, ethanol tolerance, and ethanol yield played very important roles in the fermentation process. It was identified in this work as confirmed fact that glucose and xylose utilization were inhibited by each other to a certain extent or region, specifically in the region with low sugar concentration level. Typically, ethanol production rate in SSCF with low sugar concentrations is highly depends on enzymatic hydrolysis rate. As a consequence, at substrate concentration levels (e.g. between 20 g/L up to 50 g/L), the rate predicted by kinetic model was in good agreement with experimental data and showed the sign of deviation at concentration rate of 100 g/L, suggesting that ethanol inhibition was a main cause of discrepancy. Therefore, the discrepancy between experiments and kinetic model predictions, particularly at high substrate concentrations, needs to be examined more comprehensively. Additionally, a good fermenting strain should have the ability to withstand ethanol toxicity and common inhibitors such as aliphatic acids, furan aldehydes, furfural and inorganic compounds.

82

This study demonstrated and affirmed that S. cerevisiae DA2416 is a promising strain for SSO substrate in SSCF. In the future, the kinetic model used should be expanded to introduce the inference of lignin in lignocellulosic biomass.

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1. Conclusions This thesis sought to gain a better understanding of bioconversion process of pretreated SSO waste by SHF and SSCF process configurations via experimental work and kinetic modeling. It was found in this study that: a) SSO is an excellent feedstock material for ethanol conversion with total fermentable sugars available in the samples for conversion in the range of 40%-41%, however, high lignin content in the samples, 27%-30%, emphasize on the need for pretreatment; b) modified COSLIF method is proven to be a viable method for pretreatment of SSO feedstock with the efficiency improved by 20% using ethanol instead of acetone. On average, glucose yield from SSO samples pretreated by modified COSLIF was approximately 90% versus 70% by standard method after enzymatic hydrolysis; c) S. cerevisiae DA2416 is a promising strain for SSO substrate in SSCF runs with ethanol yield of 0.50 g of ethanol/g sugar fed or 96% substrate conversion ; and d) kinetic model with newly interpolated values of experimentally defined SSO feedstock constants is able to predict the batch fermentation process well at substrate concentration range between 20 g/L and 50 g/L, but noticeably deviated at substrate concentration of 100 g/L. The major parts of this study include: a) experimental work of biochemical pretreatment of SSO waste as a valuable source of cellulosic biomass for ethanol production only; b) comparative study of ethanol production from pretreated by modified COSLIF method on SSO samples by two different microorganisms, bacteria - Z. mobilis 8b and recombinant yeast - S. cerevisiae DA2416; and c) alteration of existing kinetic model with newly experimentally

84

defined SSO feedstock constants to predict batch SSCF on SSO waste with different substrate concentrations. The findings of this thesis are described below.

6.2. Experimental Work The experimental work for this thesis consisted of three categories: experiments for SSO pretreatments, which include thermal screw press followed by COSLIF, enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation, and kinetic modeling. "Pre-processing" technologies, including the TSP and COSLIF were used with respect to pretreatments. An improvement on the standard method of COSLIF pretreatment was developed based on lower enzyme loading and using an ethanol washing instead of acetone. Results indicated the percent glucose conversion was considerable (90% versus 70%) for the modified COSLIF method with a significant glucose yield approximately 90%. High glucan digestibility of the pretreated SSO was accredited to drastic changes in the supramolecular structure of the biomass before and after the COSLIF pretreatment, observed by the SEM in this study (Figure 3.5; Chapter 3). The glucose digestibility of the pretreated standard COSLIF sample was approximately 70% as presented in (Figure 3.3; Chapter 3) with high enzyme loading of 60FPU and acetone washing. On the other hand, with a lower enzyme loading, 30FPU and ethanol washing, it reached 90% digestibility after 36 hours. This suggests that by removing hemicelluloses and lignin barriers, there was an increase in accessibility to the cellulose change by the cellulobiose, while also reducing the competitive inhibition of xylan to endo-glucanase. The effectiveness of the enzymatic hydrolysis was gauged by assessing the potential inhibitory factors and effects of
85

fermentation. The high ethanol yield presented in (Figure 4.3; Chapter 4) indicated very little inhibitors were present in the hydrolysates that were pretreated by the modified COSLIF method. In cases of kinetic modeling, experiments were performed to obtain new data (cellulose adsorption constant, enzymatic hydrolysis rate, ethanol yields from glucose and xylose, and ethanol tolerance) for comparison with model predictions. The good agreement between data and kinetic model fit indicated that model was robust and accurately predicted the sugar and ethanol concentration along with cell mass for 20 g/L and 50 g/L (Figures 5.2 and 5.3; Chapter 5), but not for 100 g/L. In higher substrate concentration mode, reaction deviated from experimental values as shown in (Figure 5.4; Chapter 5) suggesting that there were other reasons attributed to it, e.g. enzyme adsorption by lignin and/or obstruction of lignin on the surface of cellulose to that point when enzyme were not able to access cellulose.

6.3. SSO Waste as a Lignocellulosic Feedstock for Ethanol Production Big metropolitan cities around the world have been experiencing a challenge over the past few years regarding their waste problems, and having inadequate infrastructure for effective waste management practices. The city of Toronto in Canada is a perfect example with its waste problems that have recently become more critical. With the anticipation of landfills' closure and environmental concerns, the city of Toronto requires more efforts in developing economically feasible strategies for dealing with its waste. One of these strategies is using organic fraction of municipal waste such as SSO, which has a great potential for production of value added fuels and chemicals.

86

The experimental results showed a relatively high amount of carbohydrates in the SSO samples (glucose - 31% and xylose - 19%), indicating a great potential of SSO to be utilized as an ethanol production feedstock instead of using other cellulosic feedstocks such as herbaceous energy crops. A technology for the biological conversion of SSO to ethanol was proposed based on the current techniques and the results from the characterization study on SSO. It included physical pretreatment by TSP machine, chemical by COSLIF, enzymatic hydrolysis with addition of enzyme complex Accelerase 1500 and fermentation by two recombinant strains: Z. mobilis 8b and S. cerevisiae DA2416.

6.4. Comparative Ethanol Productivities of two Different Recombinant Fermenting Strains on the SSO Waste The SSO waste samples utilized in this research were pre-processed by the thermal screw press and further used as substrates for all enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation processes. COSLIF pretreatments were applied for cellulose extraction from processed source separated organic waste. Results indicated the percent glucan conversion was considerable for COSLIF pretreated samples compared to untreated samples (Figure 4.1; Chapter 4). This study demonstrated that S. cerevisiae DA2416 outperformed Z. mobilis 8b on ethanol yields during fermentation process. At 48 hours of fermentation, ethanol yield was equivalent to 0.48 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass by Z. mobilis 8b and 0.50 g of ethanol produced per gram of SSO biomass by S. cerevisiae DA2416. However, a more comprehensive investigation on lignocellulosic usage with different enzymes and recombinant fermenting strains would be advantageous in bio-fuel field.
87

6.5. Kinetic Modeling A kinetic model adapted and altered in this work to predict batch SSCF on SSO waste by new recombinant strain S. cerevisiae DA2416. To the knowledge of the author, this is first kinetic model, which was specifically applied for SSO feedstock. The kinetic model included adapted correlation of cellulose and xylan enzymatic hydrolysis, competitive substrate uptake, xylose utilization kinetics, and accelerated cell death due to ethanol exhibition. The most important parameters for enzymatic hydrolysis (adsorption capacity and enzymatic hydrolysis constant) and for fermentation (ethanol yield and maximum ethanol tolerance) were measured or re-calculated to address new changes for SSO feedstock. The newly re-developed kinetic model accurately predicted the sugar and ethanol concentrations along with cell mass for 20 g/L and 50 g/L (Figures 5.2 and 5.3), but not for 100 g/L (Figure 5.4). There were a several causes for that: enzymes deactivation; high concentration of inhibitors presented in SSO; and high concentration of ethanol in the tested broth.

6.6. Future Work Recommendations. Two lines of further study are recommended: 1) More research should be done with different enzyme complexes to reduce or avoid byproducts production such as ethyl, methane, and acetic acid. As for Accelerase 1500 enzyme complex, it is unknown wither it attaches to hemicelluloses accurately. An enzyme complex with a higher ethanol resistance should be sought. 2) The kinetic model re-developed in this work can predicts the sugar and ethanol concentrations from SSO on SSCF by S. cerevisiae DA2416 for the low substrate
88

concentration mode. The discrepancy between kinetic model prediction and experimental data at higher substrate concentration needs to be examined further. Besides the limitation at high substrate concentration, future kinetic models should address the interference of lignin for its application as well as an introduction of other feed stocks pretreated by different approaches. Other real world substrates should be tested by different S. cerevisiae fermenting microorganisms.

Procedure for Fermentation: 1. This procedure is to be carried out under the biological hood; 2. Create a controlled glucan (20 g/L) and blank (sterilized DDW), having the sample conditions as the hydrolysate; 3. Filter hydrolysate using 250 mL stericup; 4. Adjust pH of the hydrolysate to 6 using NH 4 OH and 1N HCl; 5. Transfer the hydrolysate to 125 mL serum bottle and use a scale to determine the amount; 6. For each bottle, transfer 10% (v/v) of the seed media to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 5000 rcf (or 3500 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4oC. Decant the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet with the hydrolysate by vortex. Transfer the volume back into the 125 mL serum bottle; 7. Crimp all serum bottles; 8. Flush all serum bottles with nitrogen; 9. Incubate all 125 mL serum bottles in the shaking incubator at 250 rpm and 33oC for 24 hours; 10. Take samples to be analyzed for sugars and ethanol concentration by HPLC at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hour; 11. Calculate the % theoretical ethanol yield by using the following formula: % theoretical ethanol yield = 0.51([]1.111) x 100
[]-[]

where [EtOH] f - ethanol conc. at the end of fermentation, (g/L); [EtOH]i - ethanol conc. at the beginning of fermentation, (g/L); [Biomass] - dry biomass conc. at the beginning of fermentation, (g/L); f - Cellulose fraction of dry biomass, (g/g); 0.51 - Conversion factor for glucose to ethanol; 1.111 Â­conversion factor for cellulose to equivalent glucose

Procedure for HPLC Sample Preparation: 1. Mobile phase must be prepared fresh for each run. The first two HPLC vials are buffer containing only mobile phase contents. 2. Prepare duplicate standards for each run. 3. Centrifuge sample in 2 mL centrifuge tubes at 10,000 rcf for 5 minutes to remove protein and particulates, then filter (0.22 um) about 1 mL of the supernatant into HPLC vial. Sample can be stored in the fridge for a few days if not used immediately. 4. Instrumental conditions for HPX-87P column: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Sample volume: 50uL. Eluant: 0.2 um filtered and degassed, deionized water. Flow rate: 0.6 mL/min. Column temperature: 85oC. Detector: refractive index. Run time: 15 minutes data collection plus a 75 minute pump ramp.

5. Instrumental conditions for HPX-87H column: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Sample volume: 50uL. Eluant: 0.2 um filtered and degassed, 0.005 M sulfuric acid. Flow rate: 0.6 mL/min. Column temperature: 65oC. Detector: refractive index. Run time: 25 minutes data collection plus a 75 minute pump ramp.
