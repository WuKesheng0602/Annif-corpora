Cancer cell cytoskeleton behavior on titanium oxides synthesized through ultrafast pulsed laser irradiation Chandramouli Chinnakkannu Vijayakumar Master of Applied Science in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Ryerson University, 2015

Abstract
Conventionally, single phases of TiO2 are used for targeted therapy and a drug carrier systems. In this research a harmonized approach in synthesizing multi-Ti oxide phases in a nanostructure and its ability to control cancer cell cytoskeleton behavior. This modulation of HeLa cancer cell cytoskeleton behaviour including shape of the cell, surface area of the cell, alignment of the cell is diligent by using the combination of TiO, Ti3O, Ti2O phases. Field emission scanning electron microscope investigation (FESEM) revealed that multi-Ti oxide nanostructure revealed a greater reduction of HeLa cell relative to fibroblast cell. This altered cell adhesion was followed by modulation of HeLa cell architecture with significant reduction in actin stress fibers. The intricate combination of multi-Ti oxide nanostructures renders a biomaterial that can precisely alter HeLa cell but not the fibroblast cell behaviour has the potential application of creating a multi-Ti oxide nanostructure for targeted cancer therapy, developing nano patterning devices. This unique interaction of HeLa cancer cell with multi-Ti oxide nanostructure has provided an insight of cellcell signalling which is the fundamental mechanism in regulating their proliferative characteristics.

Introduction
1.1. Introduction:
Nano titanium oxide structures is now recently has the application in cancer therapy because of its excellent photocatalytic, photo excitation capability in destroying cancer cells. There is also application of nanoparticles in genetic engineering where cells can be manipulated depending on the interaction with mammalian cells surrounding them. Cell imaging and as a carrier for drug delivery is the application where titanium oxide nanoparticles was proven candidate. Metallic nanostructures is a synthetic material, which replace a part or function of the human body using implants or to function in intimate contact with living tissue in a safe, reliable, economic and physiologically acceptable manner in a human body. Up to date plenitude of research work has unveiled the role of nanostructures in harmonizing the response of cells for delicate control over their adhesion and proliferation by engineering the biomaterials. Currently regulation of the cancer cells was achieved through properties including surface chemistry, topology, varying the spaces in-between the nanostructures 3. However there were greater efforts taken in killing cancer cells by doping nitrogen with titanium oxide nanostructures because ROS generation where species such as O2- , H2O2, OH- where by applying photodynamic therapy. Current cancer therapy approach is through chemotherapy and radiation treatment whose treatment is the most effective. However, these approaches would completely damage the cancer cells but also surrounding healthy mammalian cells. These methods have a non-specific mode of action but further anti-cancer effects is induced by chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Also these methods are whole body treatments which results in side effects where deterioration in the quality of life. Nanostructures cues play the role of extracellular matrix in modulating the cellular behaviour such as adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation. The relationship between the cells and the ECM is complex and suggest great attention is required to control the charteristics of the cell. Many research studies have been analyzed to understand the fibroblast 4 , epithelial cells 5 , neuron cells

behaviour but not sufficient research work on controlling the cytoskeletal behaviour of

cancer cells. However membrane bound heterodimeric receptor ­ Integrin acts as a communicator

in-between the ECM and the cells intercellular membrane act with. Biological molecules are in inactive state and they freely interact with the available cellular membrane to form a binding domain with the nanostructures. For practical applications the major requirement for developing the engineered nanofabrication approach is to allow processing the materials with desired structural, mechanical, optical, magnetic and electrical properties. The nanofabrication technique is divided into two major categories in creating nanostructures: top-down and bottom-up approaches. In top-down approaches, the desired shapes and characteristics of the nanoscale structures can be synthesized from larger dimensioned features. While in the bottom-up approaches, molecular components are built up into complex nanoscale structured assemblies 6,7.

1.1.1. Titanium as a biomaterial:
Titanium is a common and well-established biomaterial that is widely used in dental, orthopedic and cardiovascular implants because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability, strong chemical stability and mechanical strength8. Also titanium is now being proposed to be used as a carrier for drugs and to reduce magnetic resonance imaging artifacts 9. When titanium is exposed to the atmosphere, protective TiO2 stable oxide film is formed that provides the ability to absorb proteins due to high surface to volume ratio thereby inducing a platform for cells to differentiate. Findings imply that approaches to modulate cell migration behaviour include varying nanotopography of the substrate
10­12

,

controlling spacing in between the nanostructures and drug loading of

nanotubes13,14.These approaches have provided numerous intrinsic investigations and understanding the factors governing cell adhesion onto nanostructure are limited to specific morphology such as nanotubes, nanorods and nanowire. There are no reported studies where the nanostructures' size has remained the same but the material composition of the nanostructure is varied for studying different effects responsible for cancer cell behaviour12. In particular, designing an effective nanostructure that governs HeLa cell cytoskeletons but allows mammalian cell to spread has remained a fundamental challenge8.

1.1.2. Methods of Fabricating Titanium Oxide Nanostructures:
The most common methods nanostructures synthesized for manipulated cell is anodization process, electrospinning process and nanoparticle generated through ball milling process. However in the anodization process, nanotubes is the most common morphology synthesized.

2

1.1.2.1. Anodization process: This multistep process involves pre-treatment of titanium material is subjected to several voltages for a period of time which leads to the formation of nanotube structure over the surface. Then the nanotube structure is removed by ultrasonically in deionized water and by exposing the glossy underlying surface at the substrate. Further synthesizing of the nanotube structure is achieved by using the glossy surface by applying the electrical voltage. There are attractive methods to synthesize the nanotubes by controlling the fluoride presence in an electrolyte resulting in highly ordered layers of nanotube 15,16. Precise control of the nanotube diameter is achieved in phosphate fluoride electrolyte presence by applying the voltage from 1V to 20V17. Length of the nanotube is controlled by the duration of the anodization process however the final length of the nanotube is dependent on the voltage applied and the type of electrolyte Stimulated cell response is achieved when the spacing of the nanotubes is achieved at 15-30nm 10. There are few research where they have evidence that in the presence of aqueous electrolytes the nanotubes are not in uniform shape and replies are formed outside of the tube walls. These ripples make the nanotube structure mechanically unstable which leads to distortion and cells won't be able to adhere 15.

1.1.2.2. Electrospinning technique:
Electrospinning is the process which utilizes the polymeric solution driven from a syringe into needle by a syringe pump to synthesize polymeric fibers ranging from 2nm to several micrometers
18,19

. It is the only process where controllable pore structure can be achieved however the

application of the smaller pore size, high surface area ,malleability to conform to a wide variety of shape and size has gained attention in the field of nanocatalysis, tissue engineering scaffold, protective clothing , filtration , biomedical and environmental engineering
20

. There has been

increasing interest in fabricating nanofibrous scaffold using natural and synthetic fibers such as polylactic acid21, polyurethanes22, silk fibroin23, collagen24, hyaluronic acid25, cellulose26, chitosan and collagen27.Despite several advantages because of their versatility for wider application, there is a bottle neck problem where single jet electrospinning system cannot synthesize larger quantities. However the major challenge in using the electrospun nanofibers in tissue engineering is nano-uniform cellular distribution and the lacking of cellular migration which is an important application for wound healing 28.

1.1.2.3. Titanium nanostructure as a drug carrier:
Titanium nanoparticle widely used because of their unique physio-chemical characteristics having wide application such as sunscreen, cosmetic, medicine, paints, textiles, plastics, paper, industrial products and photocatalytic process
30­33

. However because of their unique size, they have an

important application in medical industry where they can be used as drug delivery systems, targeted cancer therapy, bio sensing application, and nano-imaging. Recently TiO2, which is earlier used in semiconductor industry was now used as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy because of their excellent biocompatibility, photo reactivity and low toxicity. But these materials when react with water results in releasing reactive oxygen species which is harmful to cells. This interaction with the cells would not be selective targeting of cancer cells34. The limitations of this method is only titanium-di-oxide nanostructure can be used as drug carrier and also drugs loaded into nanotubes has the ability to withhold only limited capacity of drug.

Figure 3: Schematic representation of titanium di oxide nanoparticle coated with relevant drug for cell permeability 35

1.2 Influence of various morphology of nanostructures for targeted therapy:

Figure 4: Primary osteoblast cell interacting with various nanomorphologies 33 In the figure 4, it is observed how osteoblast cells interaction with nanotube, nanoscaffold, nano leaf and nanoneedles where enlarged actin stress fiber are formed when compared to nano needles. This indicate that needle shaped morphology of the nanostructure does not allow adhesion of cells
33.

However there is evidence of material composition of the nanostructure determines the cell

adhesion and proliferation. Limitation of this method is single phases of TiO2 nanostructure is synthesized and used for the application in cell manipulation. Also different morphology of the nanostructure has influence in directing cell polarization and migration.

Figure 5: Carbon nanoparticle uptake by the cell 36

In the figure 5, oxidized graphene nanoribbons and amphiphilic polymer enclosed nanoribbons are interacted with the HeLa cervical cancer cell. Nanoparticle uptake by the cell is clearly observed through TEM cross section. This indicate that the cell uptake of the nanoribbons results in necrosis where outer cell membrane of the cell is penetrated
36.

Depending on the cytotoxicity of the

material, cell death happens. However there are few research where nanoparticle is coated will cell specific material which enables them to penetrate.

1.3. Summary:
Nanostructures is the only method that can intervene cancer cells at molecular level however this is achieved in using them as targeted therapy and as a drug carrier. However these methods resulted in manipulating cell by varying the individual nanostructure morphology for directing cell polarization, varying the distance in-between the nanostructures in preventing focal adhesion of the cell adhering. Also these nanostructures are made up off uniform material composition whereby resulted in specific application of allowing cell proliferation only. Therefore these results in quested us to wonder whether having a nanostructure can be made up off multiple phases of various combination of titanium oxides. The gap in the current research was to synthesize phase dominance in multi-Ti oxide nanostructure for the application of regulating cancer cell cytoskeleton behavior. In this dissertation, dominant phase of multi-Ti oxide nanostructure having 3-D randomly oriented nanostructure was synthesized for manipulating selectively HeLa cancer cell not the mammalian cells.

1.4. Research objective:
The ultrashort pulsed laser interaction with the titanium substrate has an important characteristics of controlling HeLa cancer cell proliferative behaviour and manipulating their cytoskeleton behaviour using multi-Ti oxide nanostructure. This distinct material fabrication technique enables us to tune unique composition of titanium oxide phases for the application of targeted cancer cell therapy. The main objective of this thesis is to synthesize three dimensional nanostructures having

2.1 Materials and methods: 2.1.1. Synthesizing multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure formation throughultrafast femtosecond pulsed laser: Simple but effective tuning of multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructures with pattern regularity is achieved through ultrashort pulsed laser interaction. Titanium sample (ASTM B265) grade were ground finished by grit silicate carbon paper to remove macro level defects and finally machine polished using alumina. The irradiation from ultrashort pulsed laser source was constituted by 1040nm wavelength direct-diode-pumped Yb-doped fiber amplified femtosecond laser system (Clark MXR) with an average power of 16W and repetition rate ranging from 4MHz to 26MHZ.The titanium sample was mounted on a precision X-Y-Z stage normal to the ultrashort pulsed laser beam. Ultrashort pulsed laser interaction technique is an unique non-contact nanostructure processing approach that can facilitate in synthesizing various combination of multi-Ti oxide phases in a nano structures through the vapor condensation mechanism where the material undergoes a phase transformation through melting and vaporization as well as phase explosion if laser fluence are sufficiently high.

NIH3T3, fibroblast cells was grown in DMEM medium containing 10% heat activated fetal bovine serum with 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics at 35 ° C in 5% CO2. 2.1.3. Scanning electron microscopy: The specimen multi ­Ti oxide phase nano structure was qualitatively evaluated using field emission­scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, SU-8200) and HeLa cell seeded onto the sample were analyzed by using scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, SU-1500). To study the interaction of cell with the nanostructure they were incubated at 24 hours and 48 hours. After incubation the spent medium was removed and the sample is fixed by glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes at 4°C. Subsequently sample was washed twice with 1% sodium cacodylate buffer at 4°C. After that cell were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (from 10% to 100%) for 15 min. Then samples are critical point dried and prior to SEM examination, samples were sputtered with gold layer. 2.1.4. X-ray diffraction: The elemental composition data of multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure was collected on Bruker AXS D8 Advance micro diffraction system and it is equipped with Cu-Ka source and a graphite monochromatic for elimination of unwanted Cu-K-beta lines. The interaction of the incident rays with the sample creates an interference and the diffracted X­rays is detected, processed and scanned through 2D detector. All the possible lattice planes were obtained by calculating the dspacing, thus allows us to identify the individual mineral. Each mineral has a signature d-spacing, which is compared with the standard patterns for identifying the phase corresponding to diffraction peaks. 2.1.5. Fluorescent staining of cells: The samples are first fixed in paraformaldehyde followed by incubation in milk to prevent nonspecific binding. To stain the actin and cytoskeleton, the samples are incubated with Alexa fluor 488(Life Technologies) followed by DAPI (4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Life Technologies) to stain the nucleus. An epi-fluorescent nikon E-400 microscope was used and data were recorded by DS-5M-U1 color digital camera (Nikon, Canada).

Chapter -3 Harmonizing HeLa cell cytoskeleton behavior by multi-Ti oxide phased nano structure synthesized through ultrashort pulsed laser
Multi-Ti oxide nanostructures with controllable dominant phases in titanium oxides were synthesized by ultrashort pulsed laser interaction with the -phase titanium. In this way, by varying the ionization energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser either anatase dominant phase in multi-Ti oxide nanostructure or rutile dominant phase in multi-Ti oxide nanostructure. Such unique combination of titanium oxide phases served as a proliferative behaviour for mammalian cells but not HeLa cancer cell indicates that nanostructured material can be effectively designed for targeted cancer therapy. There was change in cytoskeleton behavior including the various cytoskeleton shape, reduction in surface area of the cell. 3.1. Introduction: Regulating cancer cell behaviour is a complex biological process, where there is a need to restrain the cytoskeletal arrangement by bio-mimetic nano structured materials12,39,40. This communication is mediated by the direct interaction between cell surface receptors and physical extra cellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Mnemonic ability of these ECM's plays an imperative role in regulating cancer cell behaviour such as cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, differentiation, gene expression and signal transduction41­43. Two approaches that synthesize the physical ECM are biocompatible surface nanostructure topography and composing hydrophilic functional groups on nanostructures to initiate specific cellular response. The dialogue between surface nanostructure materials and the cancer cell behaviour is a result of external biophysical stimulus, which is crucial for understanding many fundamental biological questions in designing biomaterial44. Anodization is one of the primary techniques that can synthesize the surface nanostructure topography45. A majority of experimental evidence indicates that the nanotubes increases focal adhesion formation and subsequent cell spreading46. However in the anodization process there is no control over construction of nanotubes with uniform material composition, and due to the extended anodization process the outermost tubes becomes

12

substantially thinner and disintegrate47. As a result nanotube feature size and material composition is of great concern in regulating cancer cell behaviour. Functionalizing the titanium nanotubes by combining them with drug delivery systems including functional proteins
48

, growth factor enclosed in fibrin hydrogels49 and anti-inflammatory drug-

eluting compounds50 determines the cell fate : cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Commonly used methods for surface coating the titanium nanotubes are Sol-gel, evaporationinduced surface crystallization and spin assisted layer-by-layer technique51­53. For instance Mehdi Kazemzadeh-Narbat et al., reported that phospholipid coating of CaP in titania nanotube shows a reduction in bacterial growth but allows proliferation of bone cell. However the limitations on loading capacity of the drug onto the nanotubes is dependent on the structural parameters such as tube diameter and length54. In order for cells to interact with nanotubes their optimum diameter is 15nm, which indicates the limitations in releasing drug for longer duration 10,55. Titanium is a common and well-established biomaterial that is widely used in dental, orthopedic and cardiovascular implants because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability, strong chemical stability and mechanical strength8. Also titanium is now being proposed to be used as a carrier for drugs and to reduce magnetic resonance imaging artifacts 9. When titanium is exposed to the atmosphere, protective TiO2 stable oxide film is formed that provides the ability to absorb proteins due to high surface to volume ratio thereby inducing a platform for cells to differentiate. Findings imply that approaches to modulate cell migration behaviour include varying nanotopography of the substrate

,

controlling spacing in between the nanostructures and drug loading of

nanotubes13,14.These approaches have provided numerous intrinsic investigations and understanding the factors governing cell adhesion onto nanostructure are limited to specific morphology such as nanotubes, nanorods and nanowire. There are no reported studies where the nanostructures' size has remained the same but the material composition of the nanostructure is varied for studying different effects responsible for cancer cell behaviour12. In particular, designing an effective nano-structure that governs HeLa cell cytoskeletons but allows mammalian cell to spread has remained a fundamental challenge8. The objective of the current research work is the ability to generate the combinatorial titanium oxide phased nanostructure that selectively allows fibroblast cells to proliferate but control the

13

differentiation of HeLa cancer cells. Ultrashort laser pulses allows the formation of various combinations of multi-Ti oxide phases in a nanostructure which cannot be achieved through any other fabrication method. Ionization energy of the laser pulses and pulse to pulse separation time were able to induce various concentrations of multi-Ti oxide phases in the nanostructure. Results indicate that at high ionization energy at shortest pulse to pulse separation time displayed a material chemistry property of rutile phase dominance along with the presence of hongquiite phase in this multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure. Rutile phase dominant with the presence of hongquiite phase nanostructures resulted in non-proliferation of the HeLa cancer cell but simultaneously allowed proliferation of fibroblast cell. Thus the consequence of such generation of multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure has opened up the possibility to judiciously alter the entire material chemistry of these multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure while at the same time retaining the continuous formation of nano structure.

3.2. Results and Discussions:
3.2.1. Synthesizing multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructures using ultrashort pulsed laser: Laser ablation plume is a highly dynamic and non-linear process. The interaction of plume in the presence of ambient gas is a highly elaborate gas dynamic process involving various steps: surface adsorption of laser, vaporization , plasma ignition , plasma adsorption and rapid cooling followed by condensation
56

. When the energy delivered by the ultrashort pulsed laser is in excess to the

binding energy of that atom it breaks by means of repetitive laser pulses. When ultrashort pulsed laser interacts with the target material the surface gets heated up to higher temperature and they combine with air which is present in the background to obtain the energy required for vaporizing the material and thus plasma plume is formed consisting of electrons and ionized atoms. When this plasma plume expands outward there is a heat transfer in-between the plume and the ambient gas, results in cooling down of plume and the condensation process begins. This condensation process results in nucleation step, where the growth of the supercritical nuclei initiated and comes to a halt by quenching. Thus the growth of nanoparticles is initiated they aggregate due to the collision of nuclei and hence 3-D nanostructures are formed. When these ultrashort laser pulses are focused onto the target material only the localized region within the focal volume absorbs the energy by a nonlinear process, such as multiphoton avalanche ionization, resulting in minimizing the thermal stress and collateral damage. The plume diffusion time depends on the various conditions: laser parameters , material properties and the ambient gas condition 57. Earlier studies revealed that only MHz laser pulse repetition rates can keep the atomic flow into the plume at the critical level in order to synthesize 3-D nanostructures 58,59 . Evaporation rate of single pulsed laser can be expressed as

Thus the pulse to pulse separation time is directly controlling the evaporation rate of the atoms and similarly the pulse repetition rate influence the number of evaporated atoms by a square root. In order to maintain the quality of these 3-D nanostructures and their overall repeatability, the pulse to pulse separation time is the controlling factor where electron excitation and energy transfer occur in two separate phases. However varying the repetition rate (MHz) of the ultrashort laser pulses results in bringing the temperature of the target surface to the temperature where the synthesized 3-D nanostructures are oxidised depending on the ionization energy induced by this ultrashort laser pulses. 3.2.2. Mechanism of multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure formation by ultrashort pulsed laser: The mechanism of phase transformation in a material is fundamental for controlling material characteristics of the synthesized nanostructure. Among the oxides formed, TiO2 is known for its polymorphism, and they exist in anatase, rutile and brookite phases. The stability of this polymorph is critical, and the kinetics of the parameters is essential in obtaining multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructures. The phase transformation of anatase to rutile is invariable, and they begin to transform in the temperature range varying from 400-1200°C 60­63. Phase transformation of anatase to rutile is referred to as nucleation, and growth process is dependent on variables such as heat flow condition, temperature and time. Thermodynamic phase stability of TiO2 polymorph is stable in the ascending order anatase, brookite , rutile which indicate that anatase and brookite are in less stable form when comparing with rutile 64. This study shows that when the ionization energy is of higher magnitude, the titanium nanostructure formed is completely rutile phase dominant with the presence of hongquiite phase. However this hongquiite phase is not present when the ionization energy is of lower magnitude resulting in the formation of anatase dominant titanium nanostructures. This indicates that at high energy and at very short condensation time,inbetweenlaser pulses they results a higher amount of ionization energy resulting in phase

transformation of anatase into rutile. Low energy and longer condensation time in-between pulses results in low ionization energy, leading to completely anatase phase dominant nanostructure 56. Thus there remains a question why anatase in a less stable state is predominantly formed in TiO2, when the ionization energy is lower. Extensive research is needed to develop a clear understanding
16

of how ionization energy plays an important role in determining phase transformation in nanostructure.

A close-up view of rutile dominant nanostructure arrangement (figure 3(a)) indicates that it is an agglomeration of self-assembled randomly organized closed rings or chains and they are connected together by a small necking as observed in figure 3(b) and 3(c). Individual nanoparticles are aggregated together and the mere loose packing in-between the nanoparticles is strong because of their bonds56. This structural arrangement of the nanostructure remains randomly arranged and display no particular pattern .The back scattered analysis of this rutile dominant nanostructure reveals that the individual nanostructure is made up-of two layers: apparent core-shell morphology. Also this similar
19

arrangement is also formed on anatase dominant nanostructure. The TEM-EDX analysis reveals that there is variation in titanium and oxygen peaks in the individual nanostructure when the ionization energy is varied, and thus it is presumed that the outer shell is composed of various titanium oxides, which is validated by XRD analysis. Anatase dominant nanostructure is predominantly formed when the ionization energy is low (figure 3(d)) and the results obtained by TEM-EDX analysis provide the evidence of variation in titanium and oxygen peaks which indicate the there is formation of various phases of titanium oxides. However when compared to anatase dominant nanostructure there is a significant variation in titanium and oxygen peaks of rutile dominance nanostructure (figure 3(e)) that is formed due to higher ionization energy. For further verification, distance between the lattice fringes was measured and identified for rutile dominant nanostructure which indicate there is diverse planes of anatase, rutile , titanium oxide (Ti3O5) , titanium mono oxide formed at when high ionization energy interacts with titanium material. This analysis confirms the mixed-oxide phases of titanium formed which is further analyzed by the XRD analysis. 3.2.4.

This unique multi-Ti oxide phased nano structure
20

consist of tetragonal TiO2 (anatase and rutile) and cubic TiO (Hongquiite) unprocessed titanium substrate is entirely composed of alpha-phase titanium. In the previous section, a mixtured proportion of these crystalline phases was observed by varying the ionization energy of the ultrashort pulsed laser. The random orientation of these crystal structures could be attributed to the varying plume mechanism and available oxygen63. From the figure 3(c), it observed that this multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure has apparent titanium core and shell morphology; this shell is made up of multiple titanium oxides revealing the presence of anatase, rutile, trigonal oxide and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO phases. As earlier discussed in TEM-EDX analysis indicates there is a variation of titanium and oxygen peaks proportional, the vapor condensation formation mechanism for anatase dominance nanostructure and rutile dominance nanostructure. The ratio of titanium and oxygen formation on this multi-Ti oxide nanostructure relates directly to high ionization energy, which is achieved at high pulse fluence and shortest pulse to pulse separation time, and similarlily for low ionization energy is achieved low fluence and longest pulse to pulse separation time. As noted above as the peak power reduces with either increase of decrease in pulse to pulse separation time, anatase phase is dominant to rutile phase. However only with the combination of high peak power, and the shortest pulse to pulse separation time conditions is rutile phase dominant to anatase phase and accompanied with the presence of non-stoichiometric cubic TiO phase. Also at high peak power, and the high longest pulse to pulse separation time conditions, rutile phase is dominant to anatase phase but there is no presence of rare titanium oxide phases (trigonal cubic TiO, non-stoichiometric cubic TiO). Thus varying the pulse to pulse separation time at high peak power condition results in formation of rare titanium oxide phases. The role of these multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructures was further probed in the following section to study the potential correlation in reducing cancer cell differentiation and proliferation.

Figure 11: HeLa cell and NIH3T3 cell adhesion on anatase dominance and rutile dominance nanostructure at 24 hours and 48 hours The number of HeLa cell and the NIH3T3 cell adhesion on anatase dominant and rutile dominant nanostructure was investigated after incubation for 24 hours and 48 hours period. The cells cultured on smooth native titanium material was used as control. To investigate if the anatase dominance , rutile dominance of multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure reduces the HeLa cancer cell adhesion or supports survival of the NIH3T3 cell, we have quantified the total number of cells adhered onto the multi-Ti oxide phased nano structure at the end of 24 hours and 48 hours. The total number of the HeLa cell and the NIH3T3 cell adhered on rutile dominant multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure is greatly decreased when compared to anatase dominant multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure at the end of 24 hours (Figure 6(a) and 6(e)). But this reduction in cell adhesion was observed for both the HeLa cell and theNIH3T3 cell when they interact with the rutile dominant multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure which indicates that these cell lines are susceptible to this dominant multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure. These results substantiate the theory that cells sense changes in their environment and react via transmitting extracellular signals to the nucleus
65

.However this order of magnitude decrease in the HeLa cell adhesion when

compared to the fibroblast cell indicates that these fibroblast cell is less susceptible to anatase
22

dominant multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure, when compared to rutile dominant nanostructure. At the end of 48 hours, the HeLa cell and the NIH3T3 cell we observed an up surged cell proliferative characteristics when they interact with anatase dominant nanostructure when compared to rutile dominant titanium nanostructure (Figure 6(b), 6(d), 6(f) and 6(h)). This outcome was the consequence of multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure losing their efficacy in controlling the cell proliferation. But both the HeLa cell and the NIH3T3 cell proliferation in 48 hours was amassed in anatase dominance nanostructure, when compared to rutile dominance nanostructure which divulge that these rutile dominance nano structure are intrusive in controlling the cell proliferation. It could be speculated that at the rutile dominant multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure the polymerization of actin filaments in the HeLa cell was adversely affected when compared to the anatase dominant multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure. Earlier Jung lu et al., reported that there is improved cellular adhesion when they interact with the nanostructure surfaces which is achieved through by varying the height of the nanostructure 66. Also Popat et al., reported that there is evidence of enhanced cellular adhesion by synthesizing a novel-metal oxide titania nanotubes that corroborate our research work being the exclusive method in utilizing the dominant phases present in multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure for modulating the cell adhesion 17.

25

Using multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructures fabricated as described above, we are now analyzing how the HeLa cell cytoskeleton behaviour is determined under the influence of phase dominance in nanostructures. After 24 hours the HeLa cell is predominantely amoeba shaped cells (well defined) found in higher number on the anatase dominant nanostructure, when compared to the rutile dominant nanostructures. We consistently found that the proportion of needle shaped cell appeared in higher number on the rutile domiant nanostructures when compared to the anatase dominant nanostructures, which indicate that HeLa cells senses the change in material chemistry of the nanostructure favourable for them to migrate away and adhere. This behavior revealsthat the HeLa cells doesn't favor the rutile domiant nanostructure to adhere and form a well defined shape (amoeba), which is contradictory to the HeLa cell interaction with the anatase dominant nanostructure where amoeba shape cell is in amassed magnitude 67,68. However to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research work on the HeLa cell cytoskeleton behaviour can be determined by phase dominant nanostructures. Our results corroborate to our earlier result, where cell proliferation is observed more on anatase dominant nanostructure that was also observed profusively. 3.2.7. Lack of Stress fiber on multi-Ti oxide phased nano structure:
Control titanium surface Rutile dominant nanostructure

HeLa

Figure 14: Fluorescent micrographs of HeLa cells on rutile dominant nanostructure and control titanium surface. Scale bar is 10µm. When the HeLa cell adhered on multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructures, they were unable to form stress fibers, which infers that there is decrease in average area of cell spread. This implies these nanostructure provides cues for cells, not to initiate stress fibers because they are not the favourable
26

location for the HeLa cells to adhere and proliferate. However no initiation of stress fibers in the HeLa cell, when they interact with both anatase dominance and rutile dominance nanostructures. This indicate that the both phase dominant nanostructures has influence in reducing the stress fiber formation in the HeLa cell. Also the HeLa cells has developed highly migratory morphology having long protrusions, which is contrary to control surface where cells appeared well spread with visible stress fibers that indicate they found a favourable place to adhere. Jiyeon lee et al., stated that when the spacing between the nano rods is more than 80-100 nm resulting in non-adherence of cell onto the nanorods which is contrary to our research finding that the material chemistry of these multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure results in determining actin stress fibers formation even when the distance between the nanostructure is less than 10nm 69. However this similar reduction in stress fibers was also found when the cells adhered on zinc oxide nanorods where the diameter of nanorods is approximately 50nm
11

. When the HeLa cell adhered on multi-Ti oxide phased

nanostructures they did not have visible lamellipodial which is due to their inability to establish strong cell adhesion and thus it explains the decrease in weblike cell morphology and the increase round cell morphology on both phase dominant nanostructures70 . 3.2.8.

The figure 9(a) and 9(b) provides the evidence how the HeLa cell when interacting with rutile dominance nanostructure give rise to complex phase signal shift in the sample. These phase contrast images provides a valuable information on the heterogeneity of the rutile dominance nanostructure, which is the evidence to X-ray diffraction analysis that the rutile dominance nanostructure synthesized is a mixture of anatase, rutile, trigonal oxide and nonstoichiometric cubic TiO phases. In figure 9(c) shows the cell adhered to the control titanium sample and cells forms a broad lamellipodia, is the evidence that the HeLa cell adhered firmly because they have found a favourable place to adhere and proliferate. In phase contrast image figure 9(d) there is no evidence of variations in material properties but in figure 8(b) there is variations in material property. This results indicate that the HeLa cell elongates, when there is a variation in material property but a broad lamellipodia is formed, when there is no variation in material property. Thus AFM analysis of multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure interacting with the HeLa cell is the method where the HeLa cell behavioural changes due to the change in material property can be analyzed simultaneously.

Figure 16: Surface area of HeLa cell on anatase dominance nanostructure, rutile dominance nanostructure and control titanium sample in 24 hours, units in µm2 From figure 16, the smooth control surface, the HeLa cell exhibited multipolar morphology with wide distribution in surface area measurement for the HeLa cell. In anatase dominance nanostructure, both amoeba and needle shaped cell was seen predominantly, when compared to rutile dominance nanostructure. Thus when composition of nanostructure is varied and applied to the HeLa cell cytoskeleton study, there is evidence in varied cytoskeleton morphology depending on the dominant nanostructure they interact (Figure 7). The quantified results for the surface area measurement of the HeLa cell is presented in the box whisker plots (Figure 10). The surface area measurement graph displayed the HeLa cell distribution midpoint (median), the first and third quartile (boxes), and the largest and smallest observation (whiskers). Results on the smooth control surface showed that the median for surface area of the cell is 160. When subjected to rutile dominance nanostructure, surface area of cells gradually decreased and the median is 80.4. However in the anatase dominance nanostructure the surface area of cells median is 91 and this indicate the cells do not prefer to adhere on rutile dominance nanostructure. Thus most probable occurrence of surface area is high on anatase dominance nanostructure, when compared to rutile dominance nanostructure even when they both have same morphology.

29

3.3. Conclusion: The results added an insight into understanding the phase dominance of titanium oxides in local cellular adhesion on multi-Ti oxide nanostructure even when their individual nanostructure morphology remains the same. This unique method of fabrication using ultrashort pulsed laser where nanostructure material composition is varied but their structural morphology remained same. There were earlier studies where topography of the nanostructure has influence in regulating cancer cell proliferation. The fact that mammalian cells and cancer cells can differentiate the material composition of the nanostructure indicates that cellular functions can be modulated for targeted cancer cell therapy.

Chapter ­ 4 HeLa cell patterning by ying-yang proliferative zones using multiphase titanium oxide nanomaterial synthesized by ultrashort pulsed laser
Cell-cell communication is mediated by various mechanical and physical cues arising from the microenvironments they interact with and the fundamental understanding of the cellular behavior aid us in designing a nanopatterning device. However there is no methods to modulate the cellular behavior using chemical cues from the nanostructure. Also there is no evidence of synthesizing ying­yang proliferative ones using varied material composition from multi-Ti oxide nanostructure. This method of fabrication ying-yang proliferative zone is applicable to HeLa cancer cell but mammalian cells does not have influence on ying-yang proliferative zones of multi-Ti oxide nanostructures.

4.1. Introduction:
Precise controlling of cellular microenvironments for the application of cancer cell engineering constructs, understanding the cellular interactions in diseased tissues and creating functional tissue replacements is the current problem in nanopatterning devices
71

. These cellular communication

in microenvironments aid us to understand the influence of spatial and geometric locations of cancer cell adhesion, proliferation, and metastasis 72. Thus engineering the cancer cell constructs through cellular patterning help to minimize and mimic the cellular distribution for histologic research studies. However replicating in vivo cancer cell growth environments in an in vitro model provides us an unique opportunity to study the cancer cell metastasis, their cellular interactions for the application of cancer drug screening. There have been increased high-throughput and combinatorial biomaterial development for studying customizable efficient cellular nanopatterns for running multiple cancer drug test screening 73,74. Thus nanopatterned biomaterial arrays are ideal for cellular constructs for cell-tocell, cell-to-drug and cell-o-biomaterial interactions. These engineered biomaterials mimic three dimensional environments, mechanical properties of the ECM and chemical nature of the materials that interact with the cells. Clustered , large structured integrin of the cell act as the focal adhesion and as sensors for the ECM environment at act accordingly for altering the morphology of the cell
75,76

.Cells responds morphologically by elongation, aligning themselves around the
31

nanotopography 77. The influence of topography in cellular patterning especially the depth of the grooves has more response on cellular patterning than the width or pitch of the grooves 78. Clark et al., stated earlier that cells aligns to microscale grooves when they increase in depth of 1.7 µm then the change in pitch of 20 µm. However there is no work established where cellular alignment to groove width is less than 100nm 78. Chemical method of cellular nanopatterning has the ability to restrict cellular morphology, location of adherence, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of the cell. The techniques which produce cellular patterns for studying the biomolecules interaction and manipulation is micro contact (µCP) printing and dry lift-off method. The traditional and widely used method for cell patterning include micro-contact printing
79,80

,

photolithography 81 , dip pen nanolithography 82 and inkjet printing 83 . However laser based direct write technique are the only non-contact method which include laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), absorbing film assisted laser-induced forward transfer (AFA-LIFT) , biological laser processing (BioLP), matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation direct writing (MAPLE DW) , laserguided direct writing (LG DW) for cell patterning. Thus in this research work, we introduce a unique method to create proliferative zone and non ­ proliferative zone nanomaterials from -phase titanium material using ultrashort pulsed laser. This interaction of ultrashort pulsed laser with titanium is in the femtosecond scale where both the zones created have become bio-functionalized because of various phases of titanium. This method of fabrication allows us to vary the HeLa cell cytoskeleton and the cell alignment dependent upon the nanomaterial zones they interact with. Results indicate that nanostructures formed at both low energy and high energy from the laser has both proliferative zone and non-proliferative zone. However in the proliferation zone nanomaterial anatase phase is low concentration in contrast to the non-proliferation zone nanomaterial where anatase phase is of higher concentration. This unique way of creating two different zones in one nanostructure by varying the ionization temperature in the plume during ultrashort pulsed laser interaction.

4.2. Results and discussion
4.2.1. FESEM with EDX analysis of nanostructures generated by varying ionization energy: In fig 12, FESEM image shows multi oxide phased titanium nanostructure synthesized by varying the ionization energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser. It is evident from the figure 18(A) and 18(D), the overall nanostructures synthesized by high ionization energy and low ionization energy respectively. However when ionization energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser low interacted with titanium there is evidence of trenches when compared to high ionization energy. When comparing two figures 18(B-E), it is observed clearly that trenches were formed when low ionization energy interacted with titanium, this appearance of the morphology was due to the low energy generated from the laser pulses and the pulse duration in between the pulses is longer. However this result is contradictory to nanostructures generated at high ionization energy at longer pulse to pulse separation time where there is no observance of trenches. EDX results of FESEM micrograph of the multiphase titanium oxide nanostructures results indicate that there is variation in titanium and oxygen concentration in both the conditions. HR-TEM ­EDX of the nanoparticles results also confers with the FESEM-EDX results of the nanostructures. These results indicate that the influence of energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser resulted in nanostructure having a variation in titanium and oxygen concentration which corresponds phase transformation in nanostructure. 4.2.2.

Figure 19: AFM method to analyze the change in height and material composition of nanostructure synthesized by varying ionization energy, (a ­b) height and phase- high ionization energy, (c-d) height and phase-low ionization energy AFM is the method where we can determine simultaneously the height and phase of the nanostructure. The qualitative increase in nanoscale was detected for both height and phase simultaneously when the ionization energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser interacted with titanium material. However when the ionization energy is lower we observed there is increase in height of the nanostructure when compared to the medium and high ionization energy. This result is attributed to sufficient duration in between the pulses and also to the effective number of pulses interacting with material at a constant time. Also in all the three ionization energy phase shift diagrams, we observed there is a significant enhancement in high ionization energy condition when compared to medium and low ionization energy conditions that indicate material shift is pronounced more. Wei-qiang et al., stated that changing the voltage of anodization method results only in change in morphology of the nanotube but there was no change in material composition between various sizes of nanotubes synthesized 67. Thus multiphase titanium oxide nanostructure generated by ultrashort pulsed laser is the only method where nanostructure size can be modified simultaneously modifying the material composition of the nanostructure. This change in the phase shift is the result of effective number of pulses interacting with the target material is of higher magnitude resulting in material transformation from -phase titanium into TiO2, cubic TiO which is further analyzed through XRD-analysis. 4.2.3.

Figure 20: Nanoparticle size determined by varying the ionization energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser, (a) Nanoparticle size varied at high ionization energy, (b) Nanoparticle size varied at low ionization energy Multi-phase titanium oxide nanostructures morphology are spherical in nature and they exhibit a highly dispersed nanoparticle sizes as observed in figure 20(A) and 20(B). When the ionization energy is high the average diameter of the spherical multi-phase titanium nano particles were about 10nm however in low ionization energy conditions average nanoparticle size is 40-50nm. Frequency of the nanoparticle size is drastically reduced when high ionization energy is induced when compared to low ionization energy condition where we observed there is no reduction in frequency of nanoparticle size from 10nm to 45nm. This phenomenon is attributed towards decreased laser peak power with increased pulse to pulse separation time. 4.2.4.

Figure 21: XRD plot of multiphase titanium oxide nanostructure synthesized by varying the ionization energy, (a) Lattice fringes of multiphase titanium oxide nanostructure generated by high ionization energy, (b) Lattice fringes of multiphase titanium oxide nanostructure generated by low ionization energy The material composition of this multi-Ti oxide phased nano structure is quantitatively analyzed by employing XRD. This unique multi-Ti oxide phase nano structure consist of tetragonal TiO2 (anatase and rutile), cubic TiO (Hongquiite) and unprocessed -phase titanium substrate entirely. The random orientation of these crystal structure could be attributed by varying ionization energy
37

and there is definite attribution between available oxygen for the growth of crystalline phases63. From the figure 21(c) it observed that this multi-Ti oxide phase nanostructure formed has titanium core and shell structure is made up of multiple titanium oxides revealing the presence of anatase, rutile, trigonal oxide and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO phases. As earlier discussed in TEM-EDX indicates the variation of titanium and oxygen peaks proportional in indicating the ionization energy forming anatase dominance and rutile dominance in multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure is composed of varied anatase, rutile, trigonal oxide and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO phases. We observed earlier that as the peak power reduces it is evident that anatase is dominant to rutile phase with either increase or decrease of pulse to pulse separation time. However at high peak power condition at shortest pulse to pulse separation time rutile phase is dominant along with increase in non-stoichiometric cubic TiO. In the condition of high peak power at longest pulse to pulse separation time rutile phase is dominant but there was no dominance among the rare oxide phases between trigonal oxide and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO. Thus the role of these multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure are further probed to study the potential correlation in reducing cancer cell differentiation and proliferation. 4.2.5.

The study of physical internment created by multi-phase titanium oxide nanostructures when interacting with cervical cancer cells resulted in creation of two unique zones: proliferative zone and non-proliferative zones. These two unique zones of nanostructures were synthesized by the variation of temperature difference in the plume. Nanostructures present on these two zones was likely the combination of multi-phase titanium oxides present in the nanoparticle as confirmed by HR-TEM lattice fringes analysis. However the independent composition of two unique zones cannot be identified since there is no technique available to differentiate them. From the figure 16(a) and 16(d), it is clear that there are two different zones of HeLa cell interaction with multiphase titanium oxide nanostructures observed at both low ionization energy and high ionization energy conditions. However in the proliferative zone of nanostructures formed at low ionization energy conditions we observed increased HeLa cell proliferation when compared to the proliferative zone of nanostructures formed at high ionization energy. This increased proliferation of the HeLa cell in the proliferative zone of nanostructures formed by low ionization energy was
39

due to the anatase phase of TiO2 being less dominant. It is notable that the HeLa cells align in a pattern whereby we observed an increased proliferation of HeLa cells in the proliferative zone and the zone adjacent to it has become a non-proliferative zone. This similar pattern of arrangement was not observed at nanostructures formed high ionization energy where two unique conditions was observed when compared to nanostructures formed at low ionization energy : decreased proliferation of HeLa cells in the proliferative zone , decreased pattern of HeLa cells among proliferative zone , nonproliferative zone and the native zone. From XRD investigation, it is confirmed that rutile phase of TiO2 is found dominant in the nanostructure synthesized at high ionization energy condition. However HeLa cells proliferation was found comparatively decreased on the proliferative zone of the nanostructure which is the resultant of rutile phase being less dominant. To the best of our knowledge there is no nanostructured biomaterial which has the ability to create two distinct zones by varying the dominance nature of TiO2 phases for HeLa cells to differ differently. 4.2.6. Proliferative and Non-proliferative zone determine the HeLa cell cytoskeleton shape:

Figure 24: Influence of proliferative and non-proliferative zone of the multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure determine the HeLa cell cytoskeleton shape Quantification of cell morphology remaining on both proliferative zone nanomaterial and nonproliferative zone nanomaterial is evaluated using fluorescence staining at 24 hours. This analysis revealed a trend of cytoskeleton of the HeLa cell is categorized into three various shape include: Amoeba, Needle, and Round. Thus the influence of dominant phases present in titanium oxides generated by varying the ionization energy from ultrashort pulsed laser has resulted in HeLa cell interaction with the nanomaterial synthesized into either proliferative or non-proliferative zone. This analysis of HeLa cell cytoskeleton-nanomaterial interaction were confined to proliferative zone, non-proliferative zone and the native zone for comparison. After incubation time with the HeLa cell, it is observed that anatase phase being less dominant on proliferative nanomaterial zone resulted in needle shaped cell proliferated more, when compared to the rutile phase less dominant on proliferative zone which indicate that the influence of rutile phase is strenuous in controlling the HeLa cell cytoskeleton from becoming well defined amoeba shape. Interestingly, round cell morphology of the HeLa cell in the anatase phase less dominant proliferative nanomaterial appeared equivalent to rutile phase less dominant proliferative nanomaterial. However, in both dominant anatase and rutile phases of the non-proliferative nanomaterial zones conditions there is
41

no evidence of HeLa cell proliferation, which indicate the dominant concentration of either anatase or rutile phases formed on the non-proliferation nanomaterial zone resulted in HeLa cell not to proliferate. Heather power et al., stated that cell cytoskeleton can be controlled by varying physical nature of the nanotopography but cannot be achieved through chemical alternation of the nanotopography 84. Well defined HeLa cell cytoskeleton , amoeba is organized and appeared to be increased proliferation on anatase less dominant nanomaterial zone when compared to rutile less dominant nanomaterial zone. Increased cellular response was observed for nanostructures 13nm height but when the nanostructures height is more than 95nm reduced cellular proliferation is observed 85. Similarly Amy brook et al., research work it is evident that geometric constraints of the structures created by micro contact printing, determines the morphology of the cell and their motility in confined environments
86

. Thus the earlier research work on determining the cell

cytoskeleton were achieved by varying the physical morphology of the nanostructures. 4.2.7. Various patterns of multiphase titanium oxide nanostructures determine the HeLa cell into proliferative and non-proliferative zone:

To explore the effects of various patterns of multiphase titanium oxide nanostructures synthesized by ultrashort pulsed laser when interacting the HeLa cell using fluorescence cell imaging on one dimensional confined environments. It is observed that the movement and adherence of the HeLa cell using proliferative zone and non-proliferative zone nanomaterial is an essential component for patterning devices. As shown in figure 25(A) , it is clearly observed that HeLa cells doesn't adhere ,migrate into the right angled triangle and also from figure 25(B) where in the corner of circle also we found HeLa cells adhere on proliferative , non-proliferative zone. However in both the conditions we observed proliferative and non-proliferative zones which indicate that these zones were created no matter of various patterns created. Thus it proves that using ultrashort pulsed laser we can create various patterns of multiphase titanium oxide nanostructures control the HeLa cells into proliferative and non­proliferative zones.

4.3. Conclusion:
Ultrashort pulsed laser fabrication method is proven to be unique technique to develop nanopatterning devices that can precisely alter control adhesion, morphology, migration and differentiation. Considering previous research there is evidence of cell can be manipulated by physical cues of the nanostructure they interact with and also there is pronounced evidence of micro contact fabrication method in patterning the cell when compared to nanopatterning devices because of only their easy fabrication method. The finding of this study will definitely enhance the knowledge of fabricating nanopatterning device which can definitely influence HeLa cancer cells rather when comparing with mammalian cells. Although majority of evidence proved that topographical modification including grooves, pits were direct the cell but their interaction with cells was not achieved focal adhesion complex of the cell is not sufficient enough to interact.

Chapter ­ 5 Cancer cell signalling under the influence of multi-Ti oxide nanostructures having dominant phases
Cancer cells in tissues adhere and their interact via cell-cell communication and cell-extracellular matrix contacts for cancer cell metastasis87. Cells senses a change in chemical and mechanical signals present in the cellular environments and they respond by cell proliferation via biochemical responses. Recently, there is continuous research to replace the tissue with artificial scaffold using biocompatible materials that would enable the cells to response positively by proliferation behaviour. Earlier biochemically organized complex of proteins, polysaccharides of different length and physical properties are considered the naturally available ECM that play the vital role in deciding the behavior of the cell. There has been considerable amount of experimental research on manipulating the cell-cell adhesion by nanomanipulation using drug loaded techniques where cell specific drug is coated onto the surface of the nanostructures.

5.1. Introduction:
The approaches to modulate cell functionality are focused on controlling nanoscale adhesion either by spatial patterning or nanotopography of the substrate. The focus is now more on nanoscale surface modification of titanium which offers excellent bio integration for mammalian cells due to the creation of more surface area made available for cells to freely interact and also to adhere when compared to usage of bulk titanium material 88. Inspite of numerous investigations on intrinsic and deep understanding of the factors governing adhesion of cells to nano biomaterial surfaces is still limited. It is crucial among various different effects responsible for cell behaviour, related to viability, proliferation, motility, adhesion, morphology, cytoskeleton arrangement by controlling the surface chemistry while keeping the same nano morphology. In particular, designing an effective nano surface chemistry preventing HeLa cancer cell proliferation has remained a fundamental challenge which is overcome through synthesizing readily scalable oxidised titanium nano bio-material.

44

The directional single cell alignment is due to varied cues arising from the substrate which plays a vital role in dictating the migration pattern of grouped cells. Aligned cells were elongated near the buffer zone of nanostructure when compared with cells cultured on the smooth control surface sample. Previous studies on directional cell alignment have concentrated on substrate with topographical changes. However the functionalization of "engineered polar -neoplastic" nanostructure enable us to align the cell and reducing the proliferation of cell altogether. Therefore directional alignment of cell is attributed to the presence of varying phases of TiO and Ti present in the nanostructure. Moreover when HeLa cancer cells interact with nano bio-material formed at low peak power in longer pulse to pulse width they appeared to be not aligned, remained to have stable cell adhesion to the nanostructure. But at high peak power at shorter pulse to pulse width these neoplastic HeLa cancer cell are aligned with poor cell adhesion and ensuing apoptosis explains the reason for the significant decrease in cell number. Thus the surface chemistry of titanium nano biomaterial can provide deeper insight into the mechanism of cell-repelling when they come in contact with nano biomaterial and leads us to design an innovative non-drug induced altering cell behaviour. When cells comes in contact with the biomaterial they would perceive the chemistry of surface of the biomaterial using their integrin membrane protein for finding the suitable sites for adhesion and differentiation. It is speculated that the filopodia present on the surface of the cells acts as a main sensory tools for cells to find the preferential sites for cell adhesion and thereby initiating different distinct morphologies such as static and motile. Static cells are one which has the morphology of well-established focal adhesion with many contractile stress fibers pulling the cells flat. Whereas motile cells have a rounded body with leading edge (lamellipodium) and a tail with many filopodia
89,90

. These cells move to the desired site it is achieved by G-protein signalling

and actin cytoskeleton. The Rho sub-family of G-protein induces the actin contractile stress fibers to assemble the cell pull against the substrate whereas the Rac induces the lamellipodium and Cdc42 is required for filopodia formation
91

. Therefore the cells lacking Cdc42 will migrate in

random manner since they don't sense chemotactic gradients and thus it present us the evidence that filopodia involvement in cell sensing 92 .

The focal adhesion, stress fiber formation of the cell are co-dependent on each other for governing cell shape and cell movement at nanoscale due to spatial distribution of integrin clusters
93

. We

evaluate the formation of focal adhesion point formation at 24 hours of incubation when the cells are exposed to both anatase dominance and rutile dominance titanium nanostructure. Figure indicate that cells near the nanostructure initiate filopodia depending on the dominant nature of the nanostructure they interact with. This intricate cell signalling is the fundamental in understanding the cell-biomaterial interaction. We have found that the material composition of the nanostructure has influence in determining the cancer cell to cell signalling which provides the fundamental understanding for cancer therapy. Alexander et al., stated the micro patterned structural morphology have the ability for cell-cell communication to happen
94

. However earlier studies

indicate that notable cell- cell signalling happens, but does not result in low adhesion of fibroblast cells onto nanotopography95. It is observed that needle shaped cytoskeleton cells are predominantly form near the phase dominant nanostructures. When cancer cells interact with anatase dominant multi-Ti oxide nanostructures resulted in unique cytoskeleton behaviour of the cell where broad lamellopodial is formed at the edge of the needle shaped but when compared to rutile dominant nanostructures interaction where there is no presence of lamellopodial on the needle shaped cell. This indicate the individual cell signalling happens which indicate the interaction with the phase dominant nanostructures can play a vital role determining the cytoskeleton behaviour of the cell. There were evidence that three-dimensional microenvironments of the nanostructures have the ability to reducing differentiation but no evidence of polarity of the cell can be changed 96. This indicate that the morphology of the nanostructures synthesized have the ability of reducing the differentiation but not able to regulate the cellular behaviour.

The sensitivity of mammalian cells to nanoscale variations is offered by spacing in between the nanoparticles on the substrate 97. Studies reveal that cell respond to the gradient of 15nm per mm provides a gradient having a spacing of 58-73nm. However cell elongation was achieved only in the direction of gradient and they have strong tendency in determining the direction of cell migration. There is no evidence of earlier research that material composition of the nanostructure has influence in determining the HeLa cancer cell elongation. Also, there is not enough research work on multiple phases in a single nanostructure have the ability to controlling the cellular cytoskeleton behaviour. In this research, we have demonstrated a unique opportunity where the HeLa cancer cells elongation can be modulated by varying the dominant phases present in a multiTi oxide nanostructure. At high ionization energy from the ultrashort pulsed laser results in synthesizing rutile phase dominant in multi combinatorial titanium oxides phases results in cell elongation more predominately when compared to low ionization energy interaction with titanium resulted in anatase phase dominant in multi combinatorial titanium oxides where HeLa cancer cell elongation is lesser. From the figure and, where transition zone at 80 µm for both rutile and anatase dominant phase it is observed that total length of HeLa cancer cells was maximum at 20 µm and 40µm respectively. This indicate that cells on dominant rutile phase intend to migrate away from the material when compared to the HeLa cancer cells on dominant anatase phase nanostructure. However at 160 µm from the transition zone it is observed that at number of HeLa cancer cells elongated on dominant rutile phased nanostructure is also predominantly higher when compared to dominant anatase phased nanostructure. This also indicate that elongation of HeLa cancer cell is higher of dominant rutile phased nanostructure is more when compared to dominant phased nanostructure. In both the transition zone 80 µm and 160 µm, number of HeLa cancer cells on 160 µm transition zone there is reduced number of cells when compared to 80 µm transition which infer that the concentration of dominant phases of multi-Ti oxide nanostructure losses their efficacy.

5.2.2. Directed HeLa cell and NIH3T3 cell repelling away from multi-Ti oxide nanostructure:

51

Figure 29: Influence of dominant phases of multi-Ti oxide nanostructure in multi cell channelling and single cell channelling The cells appeared to randomly arranged but when they are near anatase dominant nanostructure they showed arrangement of aligning themselves parallel to the rutile dominant nanostructure, which indicate that these cells sense through haptotaxis mechanism where chemo gradient of the material was influenced by cancer cell. Thermodynamic nature of the nanostructure results in repelling of both the mammalian cells and also cancer cells away from the dominant phases of multi-Ti oxide nano structure when they come in contact and this phenomena is observed only when rutile and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO oxide dominant. The oxide variation in the nanostructure results in varied thermodynamic stress on the nano structure and these stresses when sensed by the cervical cancer cells, their morphology is reorganized by avoiding further interaction with the nanostructure. Schakenraad et al., stated that higher the surface energy lead to higher cell adhesion of HeLa cells. Thus it is suggested that at only 24 hours period the cancer cells moves away from the higher surface energy area i.e. rutile and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO oxide
52

dominant. At figure 29, it is observed that the cells repel away when they approach the nanostructure and the filopodia attached to the cells also repelling away. But the nanostructure synthesized at high peak power at longer pulse to pulse width, broader lamellipodia is formed on the anatase dominant nanostructure which is not observed at high peak power shorter pulse to pulse width having rutile dominant nanostructure. Cell channelling is an interesting phenomenon where the influence of rutile dominance nanostructure resulted in needle shaped cell which was not achieved in anatase dominant nanostructure. Thus this cell characteristics is observed only due to the rutile and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO oxide phase present in the nanostructure. Broad lamellipodia of the cell is found from nanostructure is due to the activation of repulsion receptors and also due to the actin and microtubule dynamics are changed while simultaneously reducing adhesion between cells and the nano structure. However this influence of using anatase dominance nanostructure which indicate that this composition of phases of titanium oxides cannot be achieved by any other fabrication methods. Broad lamellipodia of the cell indicate that the cells favour to adhere and intend to proliferate. Needle shaped cytoskeleton behaviour of the cell intend to migrate away from the zone of the nanostructure they interact with. 5.2.3. Effect of multi-Ti oxide phases of nanostructure for cancer cell directionality:

Figure 30: Cancer cell directionality is determined by the dominant phase of multi-Ti oxide nanostructure

53

In figure 30, Cell trapping using the nano structures may be due to the activation of repulsion receptors present in the cells which is sensed through filopodia. Cell interaction with nanostructures is achieved through the formation of polarized "lamellipodia" and fine hair like protrusions termed "filopodia" which gather spatial, topographical and chemical information of the environment. Cell spreading is a series of process initiated from filopodia probe the

environment followed by the establishment of focal adhesion of the cell and finally cell protrusions. Focal contact are formed at the leading edge of the migrating cell and often mature into focal adhesions. However the intracellular mechanism by which cell protrude is not fully understood. This intricate relationship between cancer cell and the multi-Ti oxide nanostructures is unique where the cell trapping phenomenon happens only when rutile dominant nanostructures interact resulting in cancer cells trapped and not allowing cells to migrate. This results indicate the cells signals to each other and the cells which make the first contact to nanostructure transmit the signals to nearby cells to avoid or migrate towards the nanostructure. 5.2.4.

HeLa cancer cell adhesion on multi-Ti oxide nanostructures demosntrated adhesion complexes with clear alignment along the direction of the multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure pattern. From the figure 28 , it is inferred that dominant phases present in the multi-Ti oxide nanostructure has influence in determining the alignment of cancer cells towards the nanostructure. However the degree of alignment of cancer cells depends the zones of nanostructure deposited onto the substrate. These zones are categorized based upon the number of cells aligned paralelly to the nanostructures. This indicate that at proliferative zone -1 there were no cells aligned vertically to the nanostructure which indicate defienetly that cells tend to move away. However in the proliferative zone -2 more cells are vertically aligned than cells horizontally which indicate the cells intend to move toward. Cells intially senses by aligning vertically and depending on the favourable area for them to adhere they move forward otherwise they move away from the nanostructure. This interesting phenomeno aids us in understanding the mechanism of cell interaction with the nanostructured biomaterial.

5.2.5. Rounding of HeLa cancer cell when interacting with multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure:

F

Figure 32: Scanning electron micrograph showing the influence of titanium nano material when interacting with HeLa on (A -C) Anatase dominant titanium nano material (D-F) Rutile and non-stoichiometric cubic TiO oxide dominant

We observed a distinct HeLa cell sensing ability to gather the information for it adhere and proliferate when they interacted with multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure. In the above figure 32(A) and 32(B) it is observed that rounded cells when interact with anatase dominant titanium nano material they were able to adhere firmly producing lamellae and filopodia. Closer examination showed that filopodia are seen to interact mostly with nano material and at this point it is concluded that the anatase phase which is dominant in multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure which is synthesized at low peak power at short pulse width is favored for cells to adhere and proliferate. But in the condition where rutile and non-stoichiometric cubic oxide is dominant in titanium nanomaterial it is clearly evident as per figure 32(D) and 32(E) that cells initiate filopodia formation only on plain titanium substrate but not on the nanomaterial. Cells which is located on multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure as in figure 32(F) there is no formation of filopodia which is directly opposite to the cells interact with anatase dominant nanostructure. Thus this altered dynamics of cell spreading will eventually lead to cell death and leads to reduction in HeLa cancer cells in the presence of multi-Ti oxide phased nanostructure.

5.3. Conclusion:
Engineering the cell-cell communication is essential in designing the cancer cell architecture surrounding the mammalian cells which would enable us to exactly manipulate the cancer cells. There have been no techniques available where cell-cell communication can be manipulated using the material composition of the nanostructure which would enable us to determine cell cytoskeleton behaviour. However currently cell-cell communication can be determined using nanostructured morphology. Interestingly, the phase dominance of titanium oxide nanostructure synthesized have provided evidence that they can determine the cell signaling which would enable us to understand the fundamental knowledge of cell-cell communication.

Chapter- 6 Summary and future research work
6.1. Summary: In this thesis, a unique composition of multi-Ti oxide having dominance phases was synthesized using varying the ionization energy from ultrashort pulsed laser. Notable reduction in cancer cell proliferative is achieved when multi-Ti oxide nanostructures is interacted with the cancer cell. Also, in this thesis cardinal approach in studying the cancer cell cytoskeleton behaviour using multi-Ti oxide nanostructures is achieved, which has the application in designing biomaterial having ying­yang proliferative properties. Mammalian cell does not have the influence of dominant phases of titanium oxides when compared to the HeLa cancer cell which indicate that this unique combinatorial material composition of titanium oxides can selectively control their cytoskeleton behaviour. In an effort, multi-Ti oxide nanostructures not only able to modulate the cancer cell behaviour but when these nanostructures synthesized in a patterned manner proliferative and non-proliferative zones of the dominant phases of the titanium oxides results in controlling the HeLa cell but not mammalian cell. This approach of synthesizing ying ­yang proliferative biomaterial has the application in implants, where mammalian cells has to proliferate but not the HeLa cancer cell. This would enable the patients after sparing surgery have a better quality of life instead having repetitive surgery because of reoccurrence of cancer. 6.2. Recommended future work: This research work has promising prospects in array of applications such as tissue engineering and drug-delivery systems. The cell-biomaterial interaction properties can be further probed by tailoring the composition of titanium oxides for stem cell proliferative study. Therefore there is wide application using the multi-Ti oxide nanostructures for differentiation of stem cells into bone lineage. Further similar approach of controlling cancer cell proliferation can be applied to antibacterial applications.
