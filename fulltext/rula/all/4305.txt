Abstract  
   SPATIAL  AND  TEMPORAL  MODELLING  OF  BIOPHYSICAL  VARIABLES  WITHIN  A  HIGH   ARCTIC  WETLAND      Master  of  Applied  Science,  2015   Gillian  Ramsay   Environmental  Applied  Science  and  Management   Ryerson  University            The   Arctic   has   experienced   greater   climate   warming   in   the   last   decade   than   anywhere   else,   potentially   shifting   its   carbon   status   from   a   sink   to   a   source.   Increasing   temperatures  impact  nival  wetlands  that  rely  on  a  strong  hydrological  input  from  melting   perennial   snowpacks.   Soil   moisture,   soil   temperature   and   active   layer   depth   are   key   biophysical  variables  in  predicting  carbon  flux  trajectories  in  this  environment.  How  these   variables  interact  is  crucial  in  delineating  links  between  snowmelt  and  seasonal  changes  in   wetland  productivity.  To  date,  there  have  been  numerous  studies  that  have  examined  these   variables,  but  few  have  investigated  the  relationships  between  these  biophysical  variables   and   wetland   thaw   patterns   at   a   high   spatial   and   temporal   scale.   This   study   found   a   decrease  in  temporal  variability  and  reduced  interactions  between  variables  as  the  wetland   thawed  as  well  as  localized  hot  spots  of  increased  values  and  an  overall  east  to  west  trend   across  the  site.  This  implies  that  Arctic  wetland  ecosystems  are  dynamic  systems  that  reach   a  level  of  stability  during  peak  growth.  They  also  exhibit  changeable  spatial  patterns  that   cannot  be  generalized.

1. Introduction  
The  Arctic  has  seen  greater  climate  warming  in  the  last  decade  than  anywhere  else   on  earth  (Walker,  2000;  Stieglitz  et  al.,  2000;  Stow  et  al.,  2004;  Walker  et  al.,  2005;  Nobrega   &  Grogan,  2008;  Elmendorf  at  al.,  2012;  Screen  &  Simmonds,  2012).  Considering  the  fragile   ecosystems   that   exist   in   the   Arctic   and   the   large   ground   carbon   stores   that   could   be   released,  climate  impacts  in  this  region  need  to  be  understood  (Walker,  2000;  Walker  et  al.,   2005;  Wang  et  al.,  2006;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Screen  &  Simmonds,  2012).  Twice  the   volume   of   carbon   currently   in   our   atmosphere   is   estimated   to   be   sequestered   beneath   Arctic   wetlands,   which   are   sustained   by   a   strong   hydrological   input   (Anisimov,   2007;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008).   Many   wetlands   form   under   perennial   snowbanks   (nival)   or   in   topographic   depressions   that   promote   ponding   and   inhibit   drainage,   whilst   others   form   adjacent   to   rivers   and   lakes   where   lateral   ground   water   seepage   occurs   (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;   Woo   &   Young,   2006;   Woo,   Young   &   Brown,   2006).   Previous   research  within   wetland   ecosystems  has  focused  on  the  vegetative  community  dynamics  (Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012,   2013),   hydrochemistry   (Buttle   &   Fraser,   1992;   Thompson   &   Woo,   2009)   and   the   hydrological  regimes  (Roulet  &  Woo,  1986a,  1986b;  Woo  &  Young,  1998,  2003,  2006;  Woo,   Young   &   Brown,   2006;   Abnizova   &   Young,   2009)   necessary   to   support   these   ecosystems.   These  studies  have  all  considered  soil  moisture  (SM),  soil  temperature  (ST)  and  active  layer   depth  (AL)  in  analyzing  the  biotic  nature  of  these  wetlands,  but  there  is  a  lack  of  research   into  the  spatial  and  temporal  patterns  of  these  biophysical  variables,  and  their  interactions.   The   active   layer   is   commonly   defined   as   the   area   of   ground   above   the   permafrost   upper   limit   that   thaws   in   summer,   thus   allowing   it   to   become   biologically   "active".   The   growing

season   is   short,   consisting   only   of   June   and   July   (Stieglitz   et   al.,   2000;   Stow   et   al.,   2004;   Walker,   2005;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008).   How   these   three   biophysical   variables   interact   within  a  wetland  during  that  time  can  help  delineate  the  link  between  hydrological  input,  in   this   case   from   a   perennial   snowbank,   and   the   driving   forces   behind   wetland   community   existence.     Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   conducted   a   study   within   a   High   Arctic   wetland   for   a   summer  thaw  season  in  Northern  Canada  measuring  SM,  ST  and  AL  weekly  at  a  single  site   in  order  to  help  explain  CO2  flux.  Similar  field  methodologies  have  been  used  in  this  study   with   the   added   dimension   of   sampling   spatially   not   just   temporally.   As   will   be   clarified   further  within  the  subsequent  hypotheses  section  (1.1),  there  is  conflicting  evidence  for  the   changes   in   SM   values   during   June   and   July.   For   example,   Woo   and   Young   (2006)   have   evidence  supporting  the  claim  that  SM  values  remain  similar  all  season,  whilst  Roulet  and   Woo  (1986a,  1986b)  show  declining  values  as  AL  increases.  It  can  therefore  be  seen  that  a   spatial   component   is   needed   to   help   investigate   these   biophysical   variables.   The   assumptions  made  from  point  data  at  a  single  sample  site  may  not  be  representative  for  an   entire   wetland.   This   study   aims   to   build   on   the   temporal   aspect   already   utilized   by   previous  studies  by  sampling  every  two  days  whilst  also  sampling  spatially  over  an  entire   wetland  in  order  to  further  enhance  our  understanding  of  this  fragile  ecosystem.      1.1.

What   are   the   spatial   and   temporal   patterns   and   relationships   among   the   biophysical   variables  of  SM,  ST,  and  AL  within  a  nival  driven  High  Arctic  wetland  ecosystem?        The   following   four   hypotheses   aim   to   help   answer   this   research   question   and   are   all   addressed   within   the   manuscript   presented   in   Chapter   3.   Chapters   4   and   5   will   link   the   results   presented   in   Chapter   3   back   into   this   larger   research   question   with   limitations,   problems  and  future  implications  of  this  study  all  being  discussed  at  this  time.        Hypotheses:   Research   by   Roulet   and   Woo   (1986a,   1986b),   Glen   and   Woo   (1997),   Woo   and   Young   (2003,  2006),  Nobrega  and  Grogan  (2008),  and  Abnizova   and  Young  (2010)  all  showed  a   deepening   AL   as   the   thaw   season   progressed   through   June   and   into   July   but   it   remained   less  than  1m  in  depth.  In  addition,  Woo  and  Young  (2003,  2006)  showed  that  the  AL  only   thawed   as   snow   cover   decreased,   implying   shallower   AL   depths   in   proximity   to   an   overlying  perennial  snowbank.  Thus  hypothesis  one  (HP1)  can  be  made:      HP1-  As  the  thaw  season  progresses,  AL  will  increase  in  depth  and  sites  farther  from   the  snowbank  will  thaw  sooner  than  sites  closest,  lending  to  a  pattern  of  decreasing  AL  depths   towards  the  snowbank.      Roulet   and   Woo   (1986)   and   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   suggest   a   surge   in   ST   values   through   spring   (June)   during   peak   solar   radiation   and   then   stable   temperatures   around  5Â°C  until  fall  (August)  when  they  decrease  back  to  freezing.    In  fact,  Nobrega  and

Grogan  (2008)  proposed  a  two-day  time  lag  between  incoming  solar  radiation  values  and   subsequent   increases   or   decreases   in   ST   within   Arctic   wetlands.   Rouse   (2000)   explained   that  wetlands  exhibit  a  strong  change  in  ST  vertically  due  to  saturated  soil  requiring  more   energy  to  heat  than  dry  soil.  This  allows  hypotheses  two  and  three  (HP2,  HP3)  to  be  made:        HP2-   A   link   between   ST   and   SM   will   be   apparent   with   drier   soils   exhibiting   higher   average  ST  values  than  saturated  sites.      HP3-  ST  will  be  seen  to  vary  directly  according  to  incoming  solar  radiation  values.      Roulet   and   Woo   (1986a,   1986b),   Woo   and   Young   (2003,   2006),   Woo,   Young   and   Brown  (2006),  Nobrega  and  Grogan  (2008),  and  Atkinson  and  Treitz  (2013)  all  conducted   limited  SM  and  water  table  sampling  with  the  former  calculated  in  the  lab  upon  return  from   the   Arctic   and   the   latter   in   situ   through   the   use   of   permanent   wells.   Water   table   in   this   respect  can  be  considered  the  upper  limit  at  which  soils  are  completely  saturated  whilst  SM   is   anything   less   than   saturation.   In   these   studies,   data   was   collected   with   limited   spatial   coverage,   with  most   having   only   one   sample   point   and   weekly   measurements.   Their   data   showed   that   saturation   values   were   prevalent   throughout   the   wetland   but   were   sampled   with   limited   spatial   data   and   they   generalized   their   results.   The   main   conclusion   drawn   from   these   studies   was   that   increases   in   SM   lead   to   increases   in   above   ground   biomass.   Woo   and   Young   (2006),   and   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   found   results   that   relate   more   specifically   to   this   study.   They   generalized   in   saying   that   SM   values   remained   similar   throughout  June  and  July  for  their  entire  wetland  as  the  data  they  collected  remained  at  a

consistent   value   all   season.   Roulet   and   Woo   (1986a,   1986b)   showed   a   decrease   in   water   table  content  by  20%  at  their  study  site.  Woo,  Young  and  Brown  (2006),  and  Glen  and  Woo   (1997)  also  indicated  a  drop  in  water  table  depth  during  the  latter  thaw  season  (July)  due   to  increased  thaw  depth  and  an  increase  in  evaporation  after  the  initial  snow  melt  period  in   June.   These   studies   also   showed   that   as   AL   increases   with   summer   thaw,   the   storage   capacity  of  the  wetland  also  increases  but  is  limited  by  the  absorption  properties  of  peat,   implying   that   any   losses   to   SM   can   be   attributed   mainly   to   evaporation.   However,   considering   the   limited   spatial   sampling   of   these   previous   studies,   it   could   be   possible   that   a   generalized   relationship   between   SM   and   AL   cannot   be   applied   to   the   entire   wetland.   Perhaps   Woo   and   Young   (2006)   and   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   sampled   a   site   where   inflow  of  melt  remained  all  summer  and  allowed  for  a  high  water  table  to  persist  whilst  the   others   saw   an   increasing   AL   depth   with   less   inflow   after   peak   melt   creating   a   lowering   water   table   and   therefore   soil   moisture   values.   The   presence   of   a   late   lying   perennial   snowbank   within   this   study   implies   that   there   will   be   a   continuous   supply   of   meltwater   throughout  June  and  July  and  with  limited  data  on  drainage  at  this  field  site,  it  is  expected   that  there  will  be  wide  spread  saturated  conditions.  This  allows  hypothesis  four  (HP4)  to   be  established:      HP4-  SM  will  not  vary  with  time  across  the  study  site  and  most  sites  will  show  complete   saturation   due   to   limited   drainage   and   the   presence   of   small   AL   depths   due   to   the   continuous   hydrological  input  from  the  perennial  snowbank  at  this  location.

As   mentioned,   the   spatial   and   temporal   aspect   of   this   study   will   be   one   of   the   key   defining   features   in   this   research.   A   concentrated   sampling   effort   over   an   entire   Arctic   thaw   season   has   never   been   undertaken   at   this   intense   level.   Yang   et   al.   (2011)   is   an   example  of  an  intense  spatial  sampling  study  of  SM  in  an  Arctic  wetland  in  Tibet.  Yang  et  al.   (2011)  used  a  geostatistical  method  of  data  analysis  called  kriging  (full  explanation  within   chapter   two)   and   this   analysis   method   was   used   within   this   study   but   with   an   added   temporal   dimension.   Yang   et   al.   (2011)   showed   that   the   measured   SM   values   were   moderately  varied  and  showed  a  normal  distribution  of  data.  The  wetland  they  studied  had   wide  spread  saturated  conditions  resulting  in  a  low  variance  of  results.  As  a  similar  Arctic   wetland  ecosystem  is  being  investigated  in  this  study,  comparable  results  are  expected.

2. Literature  Review  
2.1. Climate  Change  and  Arctic  Vegetation   It   is   recognized   widely   that   our   global   climate   is   changing   (IPCC,   2014).   With   the   publication  of  the  latest  IPCC  report  on  climate  change,  not  only  is  it  clear  that  our  oceans   are   warming,   sea   levels   are   rising   and   snow   is   diminishing,   but   also   that   anthropogenic   sources   of   carbon   are   a   major   contributor   to   this   changing   climate   (IPCC,   2014).   The   impacts   are   being   seen   globally   and   affecting   almost   every   facet   of   life   from   loss   of   biodiversity  of  animal  species  as  well  as  changes  to  migratory  patterns  (Chen  et  al.,  2011;   Martin   &   Maron,   2012)   to   changes   in   crop   yields   leading   to   food   security   issues   (Lobell,   Schlenker   &   Costa-Roberts,   2011).   Water   security   is   a   growing   concern   with   many   mid   latitudinal   regions   experiencing   droughts,   whilst   higher   latitudes   are   facing   increased   flooding   (Hyndman,   2014).   In   the   Arctic,   glaciers,   snow   packs,   sea   ice,   and   ice   sheets,   are   shrinking   and   causing   an   overall   reduction   in   albedo   (Vincent   et   al.,   2011;   Screen   &   Simmonds,   2012;   Liu   et   al.,   2013;   Vaughn   et   al.,   2013).      Increases   in   shortwave   radiation   absorption   lead   to   enhanced   thawing   of   permafrost   and   potentially   releasing   increased   amounts  of  CH4  and  CO2,  which  may  enhance  climate  change  (Wang  et  al.,  2006;  Anisimov,   2007;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Shuur   et   al.,   2009;   Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009;   Dag   &   Lafleur,   2011;  Vincent  et  al.,  2011).  This  is  in  addition  to  releasing  large  volumes  of  freshwater  that   could   have   huge   detrimental   effects   to   the   global   thermohaline   circulation   (Schellnhuber   &   Cramer,  2006;  Schlesinger  et  al.,  2006;  Levermann  et  al.,  2012).     The   geographic   focus   of   this   study   is  on   Arctic   regions,   specifically   the   Canadian   High   Arctic,   as   these   areas   play   a   vital   role   in   our   global   climate   system.   Any   climate   change   effects  in  this  region  are  felt  particularly  strongly  and  will  in  turn  have  global  consequences      7  

(Walker,  2000;  Walker  et  al.,  2005;  Wang  et  al.,  2006;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Screen  &   Simmonds,   2012).   There   is   strong   evidence   showing   that   the   ambient   air   temperature   within   polar   latitudes   has   been   warming   at   a   rate   twice   that   of   the   rest   of   the   world   (Walker,   2000;   Stieglitz   et   al,.   2000;   Stow   et   al.,   2004;   Walker   et   al.,   2005;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,  2008;  Elmendorf  et  al.,  2012;  Screen  &  Simmonds,  2012).  This  is  cause  for  concern.   Sea  ice,  glaciers  and  snow  pack  all  contribute  to  the  albedo  effect  that  allows  the  earth  to   reflect   much   of   the   incoming   shortwave   solar   radiation   and   helps   decrease   global   temperatures.   Arctic   warming   is   causing   these   frozen   surfaces   to   melt   rapidly   during   summer   months,   increasing   shortwave   radiation   absorption,   altering   evapotranspiration,   and  precipitation  patterns  resulting  in  a  positive  feedback  loop  with  decreases  in  snow  and   ice   accumulation   each   winter   (Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Vincent   et   al.,   2011;   Screen   &   Simmonds,  2012;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2013).  Stieglitz  et  al.  (2000)  estimated  that  by  the  year   2060,  snow  will  fall  later  and  melt  earlier,  there  will  be  an  overall  decrease  of  43%  in  Arctic   snowpacks,  a  1.25Â°C  increase  in  soil  temperatures  and  an  increase  in  ground  thaw  depth   (active   layer)   of   35   cm.   However,   the   effects   of   Arctic   warming   are   not   limited   to   biophysical   impacts.   There   is   growing   concern   over   food   and   water   security   for   Inuit   communities   as   a   result   of   a   loss   of   freshwater   storage   and   reliable   food   provisions   (White   et   al.,   2007;   Sharma,   Couturier   &   CÃ´tÃ©,   2009;   Ford   &   Beaumier,   2011).   There   have   been   modifications   to   hunting   and   food   supplies   as   caribou   and   muskox   migration   patterns   change   due   to   alterations   in   habitat   (Ford   &   Pearce,   2012;   Ford   et   al.,   2012).   Permafrost   degradation  leads  to  surface  water  losses  (White  et  al.,  2007)  and  less  sea  ice  is  leading  to   issues   with   seal   hunting   and   therefore   a   reduction   in   the   significance   of   traditional   knowledge  from  elders  (Ford  et  al.,  2012;  Macdonald  et  al.,  2012).

One   of   the   largest   concerns   after   decreased   albedo   is   the   effect   of   permafrost   thaw.   Permafrost   can   be   defined   as   any   ground   that   remains   below   0Â°C   for   more   than   two   consecutive   years.   In   the   Arctic,   54%   of   the   soil   area   is   permafrost   that   contains   almost   twice   the   volume   of   carbon   currently   in   our   atmosphere.   This   is   due   to   reduced   plant   respiration,  shorter  growing  seasons  and  thinner  active  layers  (Shuur  et  al.,  2009;  Tarnocai   et  al.,  2009).  Any  warming  effects  could  cause  CO2  and  CH4  to  be  released  and  produced  at  a   greater   rate.   In   fact,   potential   changes   to   permafrost   carbon   stores   are   one   of   the   least   understood   and   yet   most   significant   potential   impacts   of   Arctic   warming   (Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009).  Stored  greenhouse  gases  could  be  released  if  more  areas  of  permafrost  were  to  thaw   through   increased   warming   (Vincent   et   al.,   2011).   This   would   only   feed   into   the   already   damaged  climate  system  and  exacerbate  the  problem,  creating  a  positive  feedback  loop  of   increased   warming   and   increased   thaw   (Lova   &   Grogan,   2004;   Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009;   Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Shuur  et  al.,  2009;  Dag  &  Lafleur,  2011).     Despite  this  potential  terrestrial  carbon  catastrophe,  the  Arctic  accounts  for  7%  of  the   world's   land   surface   at   six   million   km2  (Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2012),   yet   contains   up   to   50%   of   our   global   soil   organic   carbon   stores   (Stieglitz   et   al.,   2000;   Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009;   Dag   &   Lafleur,   2011).   The   vegetation   that   exists   within   this   environment   is   key   in   helping   delineate   some   concerns   in   permafrost   thaw   as   it   can   be   seen   to   be   both   an   integrator   and   indicator   of   climate   change   (Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013).   The  importance  of  vegetation  and  varying  tundra  types  in  this  northern  region  cannot  be   underestimated.   The   fragile   Arctic   ecosystems   of   plant   communities   are   highly   sensitive   to   disturbances   in   climate   (Stow   et   al.,   2004;   Walker   et   al.,   2005).   Currently   the   entire   vegetation   ecosystem   is   helping   mitigate   climate   change,   but   if   the   extent   of   vegetative

species  were  to  change  due  to  climate  warming  or  cooling,  then  the  Arctic  could  become  an   integrator  in  climate  change  (Stieglitz  et  al.,  2000;  Tarnocai  et  al.,  2009;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,   2008;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2013).     At   present,   the   Arctic   vegetative   ecosystem   is   a   carbon   sink   as   photosynthesis   allows   for   the   uptake   of   CO2   in   a   greater   capacity   than   is   released   though   plant   and   microbial   respiration  (Stieglitz  et  al.,  2000;  Anisimov,  2007;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Dag  &  Lafleur,   2011;  Williams  et  al.,  2001;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2013).  This  balance   is   key.   However,   changes   to   soil   moisture,   air   temperature,   precipitation,   hydrological   regime,  soil  organic  matter,  active  layer  depth  and  nutrient  availability  (Walker  et  al.,  2005;   Elmendorf   et   al.,   2012;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013)   could   allow   for   this   scale   to   tip   and   the   Arctic  would  become  a  source  instead  of  a  sink  (Lova  &  Grogan,  2004;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,   2012).   The   effect   of   climate   warming   would   be   two   fold.   It   would   promote   plant   growth   and   therefore   more   carbon   sequestration,   but   it   would   also   allow   for   more   microbial   respiration   and   permafrost   thaw   thereby   releasing   more   carbon   (Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009;   Elmendorf   et   al.,   2012;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013).   If   the   second   factor   out   weighs   the   first,   a   positive  feedback  system  is  established  thereby  increasing  the  problem  (Atkinson  &  Treitz,   2013).  The  main  drivers  in  determining  vegetation  distribution,  and  therefore  "sink"  status,   are  soil  moisture  and  topography,  which  create  variations  in  hydrological  regimes  (Walker,   2000;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2013)  whilst  the  limiters  to  growth,  or   promoters   of   "source"   status   are   climate   and   nutrient   availability   with   both   saturated   soils   and  dry  soils  being  nitrogen  poor  (Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012).     Almost  34%  of  vegetation  within  the  Arctic  is  in  the  high  Arctic  where,  aside  from   approximately  two  months  of  the  year,  temperatures  are  consistently  below  freezing  and

the   ground   remains   snow   covered   (Elmendorf   et   al.,   2012).   This   means   that   the   harsh   climate   environments   lend   to   a   short,   slow   growing   season   and   the   existence   of   a   fragile   ecosystem  where  even  small  changes  can  have  a  huge  impact  on  species  diversification  and   productivity   (Stow   et   al.,   2004).   Many   studies   have   been   completed   examining   the   variations  in  vegetation  within  the  Arctic.  It  can  be  concluded  that  temperature  varies  with   latitude,   which   in   turn   drives   changes   in   the   moisture   gradient   of   the   soils.   In   this   study   area,  the  High  Arctic,  the  low  temperatures  and  limited  moisture  availability  creates  three   main  tundra  types  that  exist  to  form  a  patchy  landscape:  dry,  mesic  and  wet  (Walker,  2000;   Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Dag  &  Lafleur,  2011;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,   2013).   As   described   by   Atkinson   &   Treitz   (2013),   these   three   classes   can   be   identified   through   differences   in   soil   moisture   content   and   vegetation   extent   at   a   given   bioclimatic   zone.   The   first   class   is   the   dry,   polar   desert   tundra   environment   that   is   moisture   and   nutrient  poor  and  therefore  deprived  of  flora.  There  is  low  species  diversity  and  it  can  be   described  as  barren  (Walker,  2000).  The  mesic  tundra  environments  have  a  moderate  level   of   soil   moisture   and   nutrients   lending   to   a   comparatively   greater   intensity   of   vegetation.   The  final  tundra  class  type  is  wet  sedge  tundra,  which  can  be  considered  a  wetland  due  to   high   soil   moisture   saturation   and   the   presence   of   expansive   vegetation   and   greater   species   diversity.  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  terms  wet  sedge  tundra  and  wetland  shall  be   used  interchangeably.  The  polar  desert  tundra  is  the  most  spatially  extensive  of  the  three   environments   in   this   area   of   the   High   Arctic   (Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013)   with   wet   sedge   communities  covering  only  7%  of  the  Canadian  Arctic  (Walker,  2000;  Walker  et  al.,  2005).   This   implies   that   these   small,   localized   areas   of   wetland   communities   that   provide   the   greatest  concentrations  of  vegetation  but  within  far  smaller  areas  are  of  great  importance.

In   fact,   there   is   four   times   the   volume   of   carbon   stored   in   wet   sedge   environments   than   both   the   mesic   and   polar   desert   tundras,   with   estimates   at   50   Gt   in   Arctic   wetland   soils   alone  (Anisimov,  2007;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008).   2.2. Arctic  Wetlands   It  has  been  mentioned  that  polar  desert  environments  are  common  in  the  High  Arctic   and  that  isolated  patchy  wetlands  exist  sporadically  within  the  tundra  ecosystem.  Despite   their   decreased   numbers,   these   wetlands   contribute   more   to   our   global   climate   carbon   system,   through   photosynthesis   and   low   respiration   rates   from   soil   moisture   saturation,   than   the   common   polar   desert   tundra.   In   addition,   these   wetlands   contain   more   carbon   stores   (Walker,   2000;   Ellis   &   Rochefort,   2006;   Anisimov,   2007;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Dag   &   Lafleur,   2011).   They   are   also   an   important   ecological   habitat   for   insects,   birds,   muskox  and  caribou  (Glen  &  Woo,  1997;  Woo  &  Young,  2003,  2006;  Woo,  Young  &  Brown,   2006).   In   spite   of   their   obvious   importance   to   the   Arctic   ecosystem,   there   is   a   lack   of   research  and  publication  within  this  area  (Roulet  &  Woo,  1986;  Woo  &  Young,  2003,  2006).   Previous  studies  have  focused  mostly  on  the  biotic  nature  and  hydrological  regime  of  these   wetlands  with  limited  data  on  the  biophysical  interactions  within  them.   Atkinson   and   Treitz   (2012;   2013)   focused   on   biophysical   variables   (above   ground   biomass,   percent   vegetation   cover,   soil   moisture   and   carbon   flux)   within   tundra   communities  and  their  relation  to  spectral  indices;  this  research  was  the  first  of  its  kind  in   the   Canadian   High   Arctic.      Buttle   and   Fraser   (1992),   and   Thompson   and   Woo   (2009)   focused   on   defining   the   hydrochemistry   of   these   wetland   communities   whilst   Roulet   and   Woo   (1986a,   1986b),   Woo   and   Young   (1998;   2003;   2006),   Woo,   Young   and   Brown   (2006),   and   Abnizova   and   Young   (2009)   determined   the   hydrological   regimes   under   which   these      12  

environments   form.   The   conclusions   drawn   from   these   studies   help   outline   how   the   ecological  processes  and  functions  of  these  wetlands  form  within  the  Arctic  environment.  It   can   be   seen   that   wet   sedge   tundra   is   characterized   by   prevalent   saturation   of   the   AL   for   most  of  the  summer  thaw  season  where  the  water  supply  into  the  wetland  surpasses  losses   to  evaporation  and  outflow  (Roulet  &  Woo,  1986;  Woo  &  Young,  1998,  2003,  2006;  Woo,   Young  &  Brown,  2006).  The  initial  melt  of  snow  covering  the  wetlands  happens  in  spring   (early   June)   and   causes   a   wash   of   nutrients   to   be   deposited   on   top   of   the   frozen   wetland   (Thompson  &  Woo,  2009).  At  this  point,  the  frozen  wetland  inhibits  the  percolation  of  this   melt  water  down  into  the  soil  and  therefore  promotes  lateral  flow  over  the  wetland  (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;   Woo   &   Young,   2003).   As   the   AL   thaws,   the   consistent   inflow   of   meltwater   from   overlying   perennial   snowbanks   allows   the   water   table   to   increase   and   remain   near   the  soil  surface  for  the  remainder  of  the  summer  (July),  whilst  the  impermeable  permafrost   below   inhibits   percolation   of   this   meltwater   (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;   Woo   &   Young,   1998;   2006).  These  saturated  ground  conditions  create  anoxic  environments  within  the  shallow   organic  soil  layer,  which  slows  decomposition  and  promotes  peat  formation  (Rouse,  2000;   Woo  &  Young,  2003).  Arctic  wetlands  are  rich  in  peat,  which  has  a  high  porosity  and  a  high   potential  for  water  retention,  both  of  which  enhance  saturation  of  these  wetlands  (Roulet  &   Woo,   1986;   Woo   &   Young,   1998,   2003;   Rouse,   2000;   Stieglitz,   2000;   Ellis   &   Rochefort,   2006).   Additionally,   peat   is   a   good   insulator,   which   helps   aggrade   the   underlying   permafrost,   but   ground   ice   requires   much   latent   heat   to   thaw   and   with   the   high   water   content   of   the   overlying   soil   and   short   summer   season,   a   shallow   AL   depth   is   created   (Rouse,  2000;  Woo  &  Young,  1998,  2003,  2006).  Wetland  communities  have  a  comparably   smaller   AL   depth   at   less   than   1m   (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;   Woo,   Young   &   Brown,   2006)

compared   to   polar   desert   or   mesic   environments   that   can   have   AL   depths   of   over   1m   (Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Wang   et   al.,   2011).   Walker   (2000),   Walker   et   al.   (2005),   and   Atkinson   and   Treitz   (2012;   2013)   all   indicate   that   the   wet   sedge   tundra   is   comprised   of   abundant   sedge   species   and   underlain   predominantly   (>90%)   by   Bryophytes.   These   species   thrive   in   saturated   environments   with   shallow   root   zones   in   limited   organic   soil   horizons   that   quickly   become   inactive   if   experiencing   a   lack   of   SM   (Rouse,   2000;   Woo   &   Young,   2003).   The   lack   of   SM   and   ground   water   flow   into   the   polar   desert   environments   makes  their  capacity  for  AL  thaw  greater,  so  they  exhibit  larger  AL  depths  and  higher  soil   temperatures   (ST)   and   lower   SM   values   than   wetland   tundra   systems   (Woo   &   Young,   1998).     With   hydrological   regime   and   a   high   water   table   being   such   key   drivers   for   this   ecosystem,   there   is   limited   research   on   SM   and   its   interaction   with   other   biophysical   variables   like   AL   and   ST.   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   looked   at   all   three   biophysical   variables   but   with   limited   spatial   and   temporal   range,   having   only   six   sample   sites.      Woo   and  Young  (2003;  2006)  took  SM  measurements  within  an  Arctic  wetland  and  proved  that   the  use  of  point  data  was  poor  in  determining  the  spatial  component  of  SM  and  concluded   by  identifying  the  need  for  further  research  into  the  biophysical  interactions  within  these   wetlands.   Within   many   of   these   studies,   SM   was   measured   only   at   peak   growing   season   with   limited   spatial   coverage   and   not   in   situ,   drawing   conclusions   from   this   can   be   considered  unreliable  due  to  the  high  spatial  variability  of  SM  (Yang  et  al.,  2011).  Studies  by   Lin  et  al.,  2006,  and  Yang  et  al.,  2011,  both  applied  simple  kriging  to  interpolate  SM  values   with  great  success.  The  former  study  included  a  temporal  aspect  similar  to  this  study  but   within   a   different   ecological   setting.   Both   found   the   kriging   method   of   statistical

interpolation  of  missing  values  to  be  accurate  with  viable  results  for  comparison  with  other   data.     In  this  study,  kriging  analysis  was  performed  on  each  variable  to  create  interpolated   data  for  missing  points  and  therefore  a  completed  surface  of  values  for  the  entire  wetland.   By  looking  at  the  distribution  of  data,  heterogeneity  of  values  and  spatial  autocorrelation  of   data   points,   interpolated   values   for   missing   areas   were   created   (Siska   &   Hung,   2001;   Johnston   et   al.,   2001;   Petrone   et   al.,   2004).   Spatial   autocorrelation   allows   patterns   in   heterogeneity   to   be   investigated.   Variagram   analysis   was   used   to   look   at   spatial   autocorrelation  between  sample  sites  whereby  the  assumption  is  made  that  objects  farther   apart   from   one   another   show   a   greater   difference   in   value   than   objects   closer   together   (Nyberg,   1996;   Schneider   et   al.,   2008;   Yang   et   al.,   2011).   In   this   way,   variagram   analysis   creates   a   graph   plotting   distance   between   two   points   against   the   squared   difference   in   value   between   those   two   points.   From   this,   a   variogram   model   can   be   applied   to   the   averaged   values   in   order   to   create   a   regression   line   that   best   represents   the   distribution   of   data.   This   can   then   be   used   to   interpolate   the   missing   values   in   order   to   create   one   complete   surface   map   of   AL,   ST   and   SM   values   at   that   moment   in   time.   Cross-validation   analysis   between   measured   and   interpolated   values   is   used   to   check   kriging   accuracy   (Nyberg,  1996;  Petrone  et  al.,  2004;  Schneider  et  al.,  2008;  Yang  et  al.,  2011).     Lin  et  al.,  2006,  and  Yang  et  al.,  2011,  both  illustrate  the  high  variability  in  SM  within   small  areas  and  it  has  been  clearly  stated  how  important  SM  is  to  the  creation  of  wetland   ecosystems.  More  so,  it  has  been  illustrated  that  inter-seasonal  soil  moisture  changes  may   be   a   determining   factor   in   the   formation   of   the   various   high   Arctic   tundra   vegetation   communities   through   the   production   of   Nostoc,   a   nitrogen-fixing   cyanobacterium   that   is

much  needed  in  a  nutrient  poor  soil  environment  (Lennihan,  Chapin,  &  Dickson,  1994;  Woo   &  Young,  2003,  2006;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012).  This  suggests  that  further  work  is  needed   both  spatially  and  temporally  with  regard  to  soil  moisture  interactions  within  these  arctic   wetlands.  To  address  this  the  four  hypotheses  laid  out  previously  were  established  to  guide   the  investigation  of  each  variable  within  this  environment  and  their  interactions  over  time.      HP1-  As  the  thaw  season  progresses,  AL  will  increase  in  depth  and  sites  farther  from   the  snowbank  will  thaw  sooner  than  sites  closest  lending  to  a  pattern  of  decreasing  AL  depths   towards  the  snowbank.      HP2-   A   link   between   ST   and   SM   will   be   apparent   with   drier   soils   exhibiting   higher   average  ST  values  than  saturated  sites.      HP3-  ST  will  be  seen  to  vary  directly  according  to  incoming  solar  radiation  values.      HP4-  SM  will  not  vary  with  time  across  the  study  site  and  most  sites  will  show  complete   saturation   due   to   limited   drainage   and   the   presence   of   small   AL   depths   due   to   the   continuous   hydrological  input  from  the  perennial  snowbank  at  this  location.      Currently,   there   is   very   little   research   into   the   potential   impacts   that   a   changing   climate   may   have   to   these   wetlands.   Increased   temperatures   are   causing   late   lying   snowbanks  to  melt  faster  and  at  a  greater  volume  which  will  lead  to  a  net  decrease  in  size   over   time   if   the   predictions   of   a   warming   Arctic   are   true   (Woo   &   Young,   2006;   Woo,   Young

&  Brown,  2006).  Considering  that  a  strong,  reliable  hydrological  input  is  key  in  maintaining   these  wetlands,  any  changes  or  decreases  to  this  source  will  cause  these  ecosystems  to  be   unable   to   persist   (Woo,   Young   &   Brown,   2006).   The   research   presented   here   can   contribute  to  this  field  of  study  through  development  of  methodologies,  and  the  application   of  spatial  modeling  of  the  point  data  collected.  This  research  will  help  connect  late  season   and   perennial   snowmelt   with   the   adjacent   wetlands.   Not   only   does   this   study   build   on   previous   research   by   Atkinson   and   Treitz   (2012;   2013)   within   this   specific   field,   but   it   also   forms   a   high   spatial   and   temporal   resolution   dataset   for   future   biophysical   and   biogeochemical  studies.

   3.1. Introduction   The  Arctic  has  seen  greater  climate  warming  in  the  last  decade  than  anywhere  else  on   earth   (Walker,   2000;   Stieglitz   et   al.,   2000;   Stow   et   al.,   2004;   Walker   et   al.,   2005;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,  2008;  Elmendorf  et  al.,  2012;  Screen  &  Simmonds,  2012;  IPCC,  2014).  Considering   the  fragile  ecosystems  that  exist  in  the  Arctic  and  the  large  ground  carbon  stores  that  could   be   released   from   permafrost   thaw,   climate   impacts   in   this   region   need   to   be   addressed   (Walker,  2000;  Walker  et  al.,  2005;  Wang  et  al.,  2006;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Screen  &   Simmonds,  2012).  Twice  the  volume  of  carbon  currently  in  our  atmosphere  is  sequestered   beneath   Arctic   wetlands   (Anisimov,   2007;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008).   Previous   studies   within   wetland   ecosystems   have   focused   on   the   vegetative   communities   (Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2012,   2013),   hydrochemistry   (Buttle   &   Fraser,   1992;   Thompson   &   Woo,   2009),   inter-seasonal   CO2   flux   (Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009;   Dag   &   Lafleur,   2011;   Elmendorf   et   al.,   2012),   and   the   hydrological   regimes   necessary   to   support   this   ecosystem  (Roulet  &  Woo,  1986a,  1986b;  Woo  &  Young,  1998,  2003,  2006;  Woo,  Young  &   Brown,   2006;   Abnizova   &   Young,   2009).   These   studies   have   all   considered   soil   moisture   (SM),   soil   temperature   (ST)   and   active   layer   depth   (AL)   in   analyzing   the   biotic   nature   of   these   wetlands   and   their   resultant   CO2   fluxes,   but   there   is   a   lack   of   research   into   these   biophysical   interactions   alone   at   a   high   spatial   and   temporal   scale.   This   study   aims   to   investigate   the   high   spatial   and   temporal   resolution   patterns   and   relationships   between

the   biophysical   variables   of   SM,   ST,   and   AL   within   a   nival   driven   High   Arctic   wetland   ecosystem.   How   these   three   biophysical   variables   interact   within   a   wetland   during   the   summer  thaw  season  can  help  delineate  the  links  between  snowmelt  and  the  driving  forces   behind   wetland   community   existence.   The   spatial   aspect   of   this   study   will   aid   in   investigating  a  new  aspect  of  biophysical  variability  that  has  limited  previous  study.   Wetland   tundra   is   characterized   by   prevalent   saturation   of   the   AL   for   most   of   the   summer   thaw   season   where   the   water   supply   into   the   wetland   surpasses   losses   to   evaporation   and   outflow   (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;   Woo   &   Young,   1998,   2003,   2006;   Woo,   Young   &   Brown,   2006).   Many   wetlands   form   under   perennial   snowbanks   (nival)   or   in   topographic   depressions   that   promote   ponding   and   inhibit   runoff,   whilst   others   form   adjacent   to   rivers   and   lakes   where   lateral   ground   water   seepage   occurs   (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;  Woo  &  Young,  2006;  Woo,  Young  &  Brown,  2006).  The  initial  melt  of  snow  covering   the  wetlands  happens  in  spring  (June)  and  causes  a  wash  of  nutrients  to  be  deposited  on   top  of  the  frozen  wetland  with  limited  percolation  due  to  the  frozen  AL  (Thompson  &  Woo,   2009).   As   the   AL   thaws,   it   is   limited   by   the   large   volume   of   latent   heat   required   to   thaw   frozen   soil   under   saturated   conditions   lending   to   a   shallow   AL   depth   that   in   turn   limits   the   percolation  of  this  meltwater  down  into  the  soil.  The  consistent  inflow  of  meltwater  from   overlying   perennial   snowbanks   allows   the   water   table   to   increase   and   remain   near   the   soil   surface  for  the  remainder  of  the  summer  (July),  whilst  the  impermeable  permafrost  below   inhibits   percolation   of   this   meltwater   (Roulet   &   Woo,   1986;   Woo   &   Young,   1998,   2003,   2006).  These  isolated  patches  of  wet  ground  lead  to  the  growth  of  lush  vegetation  and  are   vital   to   the   Arctic   environment   providing   many   ecological   benefits   including   wildlife   habitats   for   insects,   birds,   muskox   and   caribou   (Glen   &   Woo,   1997;   Woo   &   Young,   2003,

2006;   Woo,   Young   &   Brown,   2006).   However   the   dry,   nutrient   deprived,   vegetation   poor   polar  desert  tundra  is  the  most  spatially  extensive  within  the  Arctic  (Woo  &  Young,  1998,   2003,  2006;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2013)  with  wetland  communities  covering  only  7%  of  the   Canadian  Arctic  (Walker,  2000;  Walker  et  al.,  2005).     The   effect   of   climate   warming   on   these   ecosystems   would   be   two   fold.   It   would   promote  plant  growth  and  therefore  more  carbon  sequestration,  but  it  would  also  allow  for   more  microbial  respiration  and  permafrost  thaw  thereby  releasing  more  carbon  (Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009;   Elmendorf   et   al.,   2012;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013).   If   the   second   factor   out   weighs  the  first,  a  positive  feedback  system  is  established  thereby  increasing  the  problem   (Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013).   The   main   drivers   in   determining   vegetation   distribution,   and   therefore   "sink"   status,   are   soil   moisture   and   topography,   which   create   variations   in   hydrological   regimes   (Walker,   2000;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013)   whilst   the   limiters   to   growth,   or   promoters   of   "source"   status   are   climate   and   nutrient   availability  with  both  saturated  soils   and  dry  soils  being  relatively  nitrogen  poor  (Atkinson   &  Treitz,  2012).  Despite  their  decreased  numbers,  these  wetlands  contribute  more  to  our   global  climate  carbon  system,  through  photosynthesis  and  low  respiration  rates  (caused  by   soil  moisture  saturation)  than  the  common  polar  desert  tundra  as  well  as  containing  more   stored  carbon  (Walker,  2000;  Ellis  &  Rochefort,  2006;  Anisimov,  2007;  Nobrega  &  Grogan,   2008;  Dag  &  Lafleur,  2011).   Previous   studies   focused   on   vegetation   variables   (above   ground   biomass,   percent   vegetation  cover,  and  carbon  flux)  within  wetland  communities,  with  Atkinson  and  Treitz   (2012,   2013)   being   the   first   of   their   kind   at   this   field   site.   However,   SM   was   measured   only   at   peak   growing   season   and   with   limited   spatial   coverage.   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)

conducted   a   study   within   a   High   Arctic   wetland   for   a   summer   thaw   season   in   Northern   Canada  measuring  SM,  ST  and  AL  weekly  at  a  single  site  in  order  to  help  explain  CO2  flux.   Similar   field   methodologies   have   been   used   in   this   study   with   the   added   dimension   of   sampling  spatially  not  just  temporally.  As  SM  was  measured  with  limited  spatial  coverage   and   not   in   situ,   drawing   conclusions   from   these   previous   studies   can   be   considered   unreliable  due  to  the  high  variability  of  SM  (Yang  et  al.,  2011).  Studies  by  Lin  et  al.,  2006,   and   Yang   et   al.,   2011,   both   applied   simple   kriging   to   interpolate   SM   values   with   great   success.   The   former   study   included   a   temporal   aspect   similar   to   this   study   but   within   a   different   ecological   setting.   Both   found   the   kriging   method   of   statistical   interpolation   of   missing  values  to  be  accurate  with  viable  results  for  comparison  with  other  data.     In  this  study,  kriging  analysis  was  performed  on  each  variable  to  create  interpolated   data  for  missing  points  and  therefore  a  completed  surface  of  values  for  the  entire  wetland.   By  looking  at  the  distribution  of  data,  heterogeneity  of  values  and  spatial  autocorrelation  of   data   points,   interpolated   values   for   missing   areas   were   created   (Siska   &   Hung,   2001;   Johnston   et   al.,   2001;   Petrone   et   al.,   2004).   Spatial   autocorrelation   allows   patterns   in   heterogeneity   to   be   investigated.   Variagram   analysis   was   used   to   look   at   spatial   autocorrelation   between   samples   sites   whereby   the   assumption   is   made   that   objects   farther   apart   from   one   another   show   a   greater   difference   in   value   than   objects   closer   together   (Nyberg,   1996;   Schneider   et   al.,   2008;   Yang   et   al.,   2011).   In   this   way,   variagram   analysis   creates   a   graph   plotting   distance   between   two   points   against   the   squared   difference   in   value   between   those   two   points.   From   this,   a   variogram   model   can   be   applied   to   the   averaged   values   in   order   to   create   a   regression   line   that   best   represents   the   distribution   of   data.   This   can   then   be   used   to   interpolate   the   missing   values   in   order   to

create  one  complete  surface  map  of  AL,  ST  and  SM  values  at  that  moment  in  time.  Cross- validation   analysis   between   measured   and   interpolated   values   is   used   to   check   kriging   accuracy  (Nyberg,  1996;  Petrone  et  al.,  2004;  Schneider  et  al.,  2008;  Yang  et  al.,  2011).     Lin   et   al.,   2006,   and   Yang   et   al.,   2011,   both   illustrate   the   high   variability   in   SM   within   small  areas  and  it  has  been  clearly  stated  how  important  SM  is  to  the  creation  of  wetland   ecosystems.   More   so,   it   has   been   stated   that   inter-seasonal   soil   moisture   changes   may   be   a   determining   factor   in   the   formation   of   the   various   high   Arctic   tundra   vegetation   communities   through   the   production   of   Nostoc,   a   nitrogen   fixing   bacteria   that   is   readily   needed  in  a  nutrient  poor  soil  environment.  This  suggests  that  further  work  is  needed  both   spatially  and  temporally  in  regards  to  biophysical  interactions  within  these  arctic  wetlands.     Currently,  there  is  very  little  research  into  the  potential  impacts  that  a  changing  climate   may   have   to   these   wetlands.   The   research   presented   here   can   contribute   to   this   field   through   development   of   methodologies,   and   the   application   of   spatial   modelling   of   the   point   data   collected.   This   research   will   help   connect   late   season   and   perennial   snowmelt   with  the  adjacent  wetland.  Through  an  increase  in  the  spatial  and  temporal  sampling  of  SM,   ST   and   AL   readings,   it   is   hoped   that   a   deeper   understanding   of   the   driving   biophysical   variables  for  this  vegetation  community  can  be  achieved.  Not  only  does  this  data  build  on  to   the  previous  studies,  (Atkinson  and  Treitz,  2012;  2013),  but  it  also  forms  a  high  spatial  and   temporal   resolution   dataset   for   future   and   expanding   studies   into   other   biophysical   and   biogeochemical  studies.

3.2. Methodology   3.2.1. Study  Area   The   data   collected   for   this   report   came   from   the   Cape   Bounty   Arctic   Watershed   Observatory   located   on   Melville   Island,   Nunavut   (74Â°55'N,   109Â°35W)   (Figure   3.1.A).   Melville   Island   is   located   west   of   Ellesmere   Island   within   the   Canadian   High   Arctic.   Cape   Bounty  is  situated  on  the  south  of  Melville  close  to  the  Nunavut  and  North  West  Territories   border.   The   area   has   an   average   daily   temperature   during   summer   of   3.7Â°C,   and   the   weather   generally   includes   minimal   precipitation,   intermittent   fog   and   frequent   high   winds.   Two   large   lakes   fed   by   two   separate   rivers   and   watersheds   characterize   the   area   that   is   underlain   by   Devonian   sedimentary   rocks   covered   in   Holocene   marine   sediments   and  glacial  till  (Hodgson,  Vincent  &  Fyles,  1984).   The   4.0   ha   field   site   chosen   for   this   study   was   located   directly   beneath   a   large   perennial  snowbank  that  provided  the  hydrological  input  for  this  area  (Figure  3.1.B).  The   sample   site   selected   is   located   within   a   previous   study   area   used   by   Atkinson   and   Treitz   (2012,  2013)  and  can  be  classified  as  wet-sedge  with  a  high  soil  moisture  content  leading   to  localized  saturation  with  an  abundance  of  sedge  grasses  and  mosses  (Walker  et  al.,  2005;   Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008).  The  summer  melting  period  generally  starts  at  the  beginning  of   June  with  temperatures  steadily  rising  throughout  the  following  two  months  before  falling   to   below   freezing   in   mid-August   and   remaining   there   until   June   the   following   year   (Steiglitz,   2000;   Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008).   This   allows   for   a   short   period   (two   months   approximately)   when   temperatures   are   consistently   above   freezing   and   so   it   presents   a   unique   opportunity   to   study   an   entire   Arctic   thaw   event.   Peak   vegetation   growth   can   be   commonly   seen   mid   to   late   July   (Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2013)   whilst   peak   SM   values   can   be      23  

seen  in  late  June  (Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008).  In  2014  it  was  a  comparatively  colder  season   to   previous   years,   with   warmer   temperatures   not   occurring   until   late   June   and   therefore   peak   melt   being   seen   in   early   July.      Temperatures   then   decreased   back   down   to   freezing   with  snowfall  beginning  once  again  in  early  August.

3.2.2. Data  Collection   Data  collection  for  this  study  was  completed  from  June  19  to  July  30,  2014.  A  stratified   random  sampling  technique  was  used  in  the  4  ha  site  (200  m  x  200  m),  it  was  subdivided   divided  into  four  cardinal  quadrants  (100  m  x  100  m).  Within  each  quadrant,  sample  sites   were   randomly   generated   and   their   GPS   co-ordinates   uploaded   to   a   GarminGPS   map   76.   In   total,  55  of  the  intended  65  sample  sites  were  used  for  analysis  with  ten  removed  for  being   too  close  to  another  site  or  in  an  area  that  could  not  be  analyzed,  on  a  rock  for  example.  The   wetland  sample  site  finished  with  two  quadrants  containing  12  sites  (SW  and  NE),  one  with   16   sites   (SE)   and   finally   one   with   14   (NW).   Only   the   specified   55   sites   were   selected   for   sampling  and  their  locations  allowed  for  adequate  coverage  over  the  field  area  for  spatial   interpolation  (Figure  3.1.A)  (Petrone  et  al.,  2004;  Pan  et  al.,  2008;  Yang  et  al.,  2011).  As  of   June   19,   75%   of   the   data   sites   were   clear   of   snow   and   therefore   determined   suitable   for   sampling.     Biophysical   variable   data   collection   was   performed   individually   for   ST,   AL   and   SM   at   each  site.  AL  (cm)  was  measured  using  an  active  layer  probe  inserted  vertically  down  into   the  ground  with  force  until  resistance  was  met  (Figure  3.2.A)(Woo  &  Young,  1998;  Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008).   The   probe   was   calibrated   daily   in   the   field   to   within   1cm.   All   ST   (Â°C)   measurements   were   performed   using   a   Taylor   Precision   Products   Inc.   digital   thermometer   model   9878E   at   a   depth   of   5   cm   (Figure   3.2.B)(Nobrega   &   Grogan,   2008).   Finally,   SM   (%Vol)   was   measured   using   a   theta   probe   with   attached   HH2   moisture   logger   (Delta   T   Devices  Ltd)  at  a  depth  of  5  cm  (Figure  3.2.C).

   If  AL  was  less  than  5  cm,  ST  and  SM  were  not  recorded.  Not  all  sites  thawed  at  the  same   rate  and  so  it  was  decided  that  sampling  be  done  daily  but  rotationally  around  the  variables   being   measured.   In   this   way,   a   series   of   20   data   sets   were   collected   throughout   the   season,   within   which,   all   three   biophysical   variables   were   sampled   and   each   set   covered   a   48-hour   period.  On  the  first  day  of  each  set,  AL  was  measured  at  all  55  sample  sites,  which  allowed   variations   in   thaw   depth   to   be   studied.   On   the   second   day   of   sampling,   only   sites   that   showed   an   AL   depth   greater   than   5   cm   the   previous   day   were   sampled   for   ST   and   SM,   thus   completing  the  data  set.  This  intensive  daily  sampling  allowed  for  the  temporal  changes  in   this  wetland  to  be  investigated  thoroughly  with  each  sample  point  being  measured  for  AL,   SM   and   ST   every   48   hours.   This   was   deemed   appropriate   considering   the   fast   changes   in   temperature   and   snowmelt   seen   in   this   environment.   Sampling   began   June   19th   and   within   five  days  the  snow  covered  sample  sites  reduced  from  25%  to  5%,  and  within  10  days  the   sites   available   for   SM   sampling   increased   from   40%   to   82%   of   the   field   area.   The   areas   closest  to  the  snowpack  remained  frozen  longest  and  data  collection  at  all  55  sample  sites   was  not  possible  until  July  20th.  Due  to  this,  sample  size  for  SM  and  ST  varies  throughout

the  season.  Additionally,  there  are  10  days  of  lost  data  during  mid  July  due  to  issues  with   wildlife  invading  the  field  area,  bad  weather  and  broken  equipment.     Two   additional   sources   of   field   data   were   acquired   through   other   sources.   A   digital   elevation  model  (DEM)  was  acquired  from  Collingwood  (2014)  at  a  high  spatial  resolution   of  1  m.  The  DEM  was  acquired  during  the  2012  summer  field  season  at  Cape  Bounty  and   was   analyzed   to   study   slope   and   aspect   in   order   to   investigate   drainage   patterns   alongside   the  SM  data.  In  addition,  Queen's  University  (Kingston,  ON)  provided  hourly  meteorological   (MET)   data   for   the   Cape   Bounty   sample   site   for   the   period   of   June   1   to   July   31   which   allowed  incoming  solar  radiation  analyses  to  be  completed  in  order  to  investigate  changes   in  ST  and  therefore  potentially  AL.        3.2.3. Data  Processing      KRIGING   In   total,   eight   data   sets   were   chosen   for   kriging   analyses   that   fairly   represent   the   spring,  early  summer  and  late  summer  periods  already  identified.  Two  sets  from  June  were   chosen   to   represent   early   and   late   spring,   a   third   set   a   week   later   representing   early   summer   and   finally,   five   sets   from   the   last   two   weeks   of   July   will   show   spatial   changes   during   peak   vegetation   growth.   These   sets   were   also   chosen   as   all   three   biophysical   variables  could  be  sampled  at  these  times  allowing  for  no  missing  data.   Spatial   interpolation   was   applied   to   the   values   of   the   samples   to   examine   spatial   patterns   within   the   data.   General   information   on   data   outliers,   distribution   of   data,   and   data   variability   within   each   data   set   were   calculated  before   variagram   analysis   allowed   a   model   of   best   fit   to   be   added   to   the   data   values.   Finally,   cross-validation   allowed   for      28  

accuracy   between   models   to   be   examined   so   that   the   most   statistically   accurate   model   was   used   for   the   final   kriged   layer   (Pan   et   al.,   2008;   Yang   et   al.,   2011).   In   order   to   have   reliable   data   for   each   sample   site   for   each   set,   assumptions   had   to   be   made   in   regards   to   frozen   sample  sites.  As  the  AL  of  all  sites  differed  there  were  examples  of  frozen  ground  where  no   SM  reading  could  be  taken.  It  was  decided  that  the  missing  values  would  be  set  to  the  first   unfrozen   reading   that   could   be   taken   as   Stieglitz   et   al.   (2011)   showed   that   limited   percolation  of  surface  water  occurs  between  fall  freezing  and  spring  thaw.  In  this  respect,  it   was  presumed  that  due  to  the  intensity  of  sampling  every  48  hours,  it  would  be  reasonable   to   presume   that   the   moisture   content   of   the   soil   would   not   have   changed   significantly   in   the   time   between   the   active   layer   thawing   to   below   5cm   (the   threshold   for   theta   probe   analysis)  and  sampling.        3.3. Results   TEMPORAL  CHANGES   Data   were   collected   from   June   19   to   July   30,   representing   an   entire   thaw   season.   Temporally,   the   data   sets   cover   both   spring   and   summer   and   so   these   changes   in   season   have   been   identified   on   all   temporal   graphs.   As   mentioned,   a   single   set   of   data   was   collected   every   48   hours   with   ST,   SM,   and   AL   all   measured   in   this   time.   In   total,   20   sets   were  collected  covering  40  days  from  June  19  to  July  29.  In  order  to  divide  these  sets  up   into  comparable  seasons,  the  following  was  decided.  Sets  1  to  6  (June  19  to  30)  represent   initial   spring   thaw   and   snow   melt.   The   remaining   sets   have   been   split   into   early   summer   from  July  1  to  15  (sets  7  to  13)  and  peak  growth  or  late  summer  from  July  16  to  29  (sets  14   to  20).        29  

Within  Figure  3.3  the  temporal  changes  to  the  three  biophysical  variables  of  SM,  AL  and   ST  are  shown  for  the  entire  sampling  season.  First,  the  SM  values  remain  fairly  consistent   throughout   the   wetland   and   only   slightly   increase   in   %   vol   between   peak   growth   and   spring.   The   logarithmic   trend   line   fit   to   the   entire   wetland   SM   data   shows   an   R2   value   of   0.65,   showing   that   there   is   a   weaker   relationship   with   this   variable   over   time.   This   is   to   be   expected  if  the  averaged  values  show  little  change  between  seasons.  However,  it  would  be   expected   that   after   initial   snowmelt   the   values   would   increase   during   early   summer   but   despite  lack  of  data,  this  does  not  seem  the  case.  There  is  however,  a  strong  difference  in   values   between   quadrants   with   SE   and   NE   areas   showing   a   higher   average   saturation   level   than  the  NW  and  SW  quadrants  by  almost  20  %  vol  creating  an  east  to  west  (E/W)  trend.   The  other  hydrological  input  of  rain  can  be  seen  to  have  minimally  affected  the  wetland  and   SM  values,  Figure  3.4.A.  There  was  no  precipitation  for  spring  and  most  of  early  summer.   Peak  growth  saw  the  greatest  input  of  rain,  but  with  limited  changes  in  SM  values.   Second,  it  can  be  seen  that  AL  increases  in  depth  throughout  spring  and  summer.  The   second   order   polynomial   trend   line   fits   the   average   data   well   to   give   an   R2   value   of   0.99.   The   rate   of   change   decreases   as   the   season   progresses   with   the   period   of   peak   growth   showing  a  slower  rate  of  thaw  than  in  spring  and  early  summer.  At  the  quadrant  level,  the   SE   has   a   shallower   overall   thaw   depth   with   the   NW   having   a   much   deeper   AL   depth   throughout  the  season.  Both  the  NE  and  SW  quadrants  have  similar  thaw  depths  and  so  the   average  for  the  entire  wetland  is  situated  here.   Finally,   ST   values   show   a   steady   increase   during   spring   thaw   and   early   summer,   but   then   erratic   fluctuations   during   peak   growth.   The   second-order   polynomial   trend   line   shows  an  R2  squared  value  of  0.73  for  changes  in  ST  with  time.  This  is  higher  than  SM  but  

  

30  

lower  than  AL.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  fastest  changes  in  ST  were  seen  during  spring,  before   the   rate   of   change   slowed   during   early   summer   and   eventually   plateaued   through   peak   growth,   similar   to   the   changes   seen   in   AL.   At   the   quadrant   level,   throughout   both   spring   and   summer,   the   SE   and   NE   quadrants   have   lower   average   ST   values   similar   to   the   SM   and   AL,   which   further   implies   a   potential   E/W   spatial   trend.   Despite   the   plateau   of   changing   ST   values  during  peak  growth,  highly  variable  short-term  fluctuations  in  ST  values  are  clearly   seen.   These   erratic   variations   in   temperature   can   be   explained   partially   by   investigating   incoming  solar  radiation  levels  (Figure  3.4.B).  It  can  be  clearly  seen  that  ST  values  steadily   increase   during   spring   and   early   summer   despite   fluctuating   solar   radiation   and   air   temperatures.   As   the   season   reaches   peak   growth,   the   ST   values   begin   to   fluctuate   as   previously   explained,   but   the   solar   radiation   and   air   temperature   values   change   on   the   same   temporal   scale.   The   ST   values   within   the   wetland   clearly   match   up   with   the   air   temperature  and  solar  radiation  fluxes  during  late  July.

   The  general  descriptive  statistics  in  Figure  3.5  allow  for  variations  between  sample   sets   to   be   looked   at   further.   As   expected,   the   temporal   changes   in   mean   and   median   values   are   identical   to   the   relationships   just   described.   However,   what   is   key   to   note   is   that   the   median  values  remain  similar  to  their  corresponding  means  implying  that  outliers  do  not   dominate  any  of  the  data  sets.  In  addition,  the  coefficient  of  variance  has  all  results  being   greater  than  30%,  the  threshold  for  data  showing  "strong  variation"  between  values  (Yang      33  

et  al.,  2011).  This  means  that  as  well  as  showing  variations  between  sets,  there  are  strong   variations  in  values  within  individual  sets.  The  lowest  values  were  seen  within  the  SM  data   sets   with   variance   remaining   consistently   around   30-35%   all   season.   This   is   still   considered   statistically   as   "strong   variation"   but   comparatively   lower   to   both   ST   and   AL   data  sets,  which  both  have  variance  values  above  70%  and  do  not  lower  to  a  comparative   level  (30-40%)  until  peak  growth  in  late  summer.  The  SM  values  within  the  wetland  as  a   whole   must   therefore   be   more   similar   around   the   average   than   ST   and   AL   at   the   beginning   of  the  season.  In  Figure  3.5.A,  an  additional  calculation  of  total  number  of  saturated  (>95  %   vol)   samples   was   calculated   that   ranged   from   18%   at   the   beginning   of   sampling   to   38%   by   the   end.   This   increase   in   total   saturation   can   be   seen   in   the   mean   value   increasing   from   66.35   %   vol   to   73.58   %   vol   for   the   sample   site   overall   implying   an   increase   in   overall   wetness  for  the  wetland  as  the  season  progresses.  Figure  3.5.B  shows  that  as  AL  increased   in  depth  across  the  entire  field  site,  the  variance  between  samples  decreased  from  72%  to   33%.   As   the   season   progressed,   not   all   sites   thawed   at   the   same   rate   but   once   warmer   temperatures   allowed   more   sites   to   thaw   further   into   the   season,   the   variation   between   sample   sites   decreased.   Air   temperatures   increase   moving   into   summer   from   spring   (Figure  3.5.C),  allowing  for  higher  ST  values  to  occur  and  therefore  lowering  the  variability   between   sample   sites.   During   peak   growth   at   the   end   of   July,   ST   fluctuates   as   explained   previously.   Despite   this,   the   coefficient   of   variance   stabilizes   and   remains   at   its   lowest   value  of  38%.  This  implies  that  despite  a  large  variation  in  temperature  between  sampling   sets,  there  are  consistently  lower  and  higher  values  within  each  set  and  the  wetland  itself.   These  temporal  relationships  are  based  on  averages  for  all  sample  sites  throughout   the   wetland   and   per   quadrant,   however   there   are   relationship   changes   temporally   on   a

localized  level  too.  To  investigate  the  relationships  between  all  three  variables  laid  out  in   Figure   3.3,   R2   values   for   each   variable   interaction   for   each   season   were   calculated   (Table   3.1).   There   is   little   to   no   relationship   between   AL   depth   and   SM,   which   is   backed   up   by   looking   at   the   regression   values   within   Table   3.1   that   show   an   R2   value   of   0.33   in   Spring   that   subsequently   drops   to   0.03   by   peak   growth.   There   is   a   fairly   loose   relationship   between   increasing   ST   values   and   marginally   increasing   SM   readings   during   spring   thaw   that   then   disappears   during   early   summer   and   peak   growth.   Within   Table   3.1,   the   regression  values  of  SM  vs.  ST  show  an  average  R2  value  in  spring  of  0.41  that  drops  to  0.03   by   peak   growth.   Finally,   Al   depth   increases   with   ST   values.   This   is   further   emphasized   within   Table   3.1   with   strong   R2   values   ranging   from   0.68   to   0.76   throughout   June   and   July.     By  looking  at  all  of  the  regression  changes  from  different  seasons  of  data  it  can  be  seen  that   relationships   at   the   beginning   of   the   spring   season   are   not   reflected   as   strongly   during   late   summer  with  the  exception  of  AL  vs.  ST.

   SPATIAL  CHANGES    

To   begin,   each   set   of   data   was   investigated   for   normality   and   the   histograms   produced  showed  that  almost  all  the  data  sets  had  non-normally  distributed  data.  Within   SM   data   sets,   due   to   the   high   frequency   of   saturated   samples,   all   sets   showed   bimodal   distributions   with   two   peaks   in   data   values   whilst   many   ST   and   AL   sets   had   either   positively  or  negatively  skewed  data.  In  order  for  kriging  to  be  most  effective,  data  must  be   transformed   to   as   close   to   normally   distributed   as   possible.   Therefore,   all   data   sets   underwent  a  "Normal  Score"  transformation  within  the  geostatistical  wizard  in  ArcMap  in   order   to   achieve   the   most   statistically   accurate   interpolations.   Subsequently,   variagram   analyses   of   average   binned   values   allowed   for   various   models   to   be   applied   to   the   data   values  (Appendix  A)  that  then  predicted  the  unknown  values.   ST   and   AL   data   sets   were   all   fitted   with   either   rotational   quadratic   or   exponential   models.  SM  data  sets  were  all  fitted  with  either  Gaussian  or  circular  models.  This  difference   in  modelling  is  likely  due  to  the  different  variability  patterns  SM  values  show  compared  to   AL  and  ST  within  the  wetland.  This  would  imply  that  ST  and  AL  spatial  changes  are  more   closely   linked   than   SM.   If   they   both   show   the   same   distributary   patterns   of   variability   it   would   imply   that   their   interactions   are   more   closely   related.   This   seems   plausible   considering   that   as   ST   increases,   AL   will   also   increase   due   to   the   increased   thaw.   It   also

perhaps  disproves  the  theory  of  increased  AL  causing  decreased  SM  values  as  their  spatial   relationships  are  different.          The  kriged  results  for  the  three  biophysical  variables,  Figures  3.6  to  3.8,  all  show  the  

temporal   relationships   previously   discussed.   However,   the   added   spatial   dimension   allows   us  to  see  that  not  all  sites  show  the  same  relationships  throughout  the  season  as  expected   by  the  regression  analyses.  By  first  looking  at  the  ST  analyses,  Figure  3.6,  it  can  be  seen  that   temperatures  increase  steadily  in  spring  and  early  summer  within  the  wetland  as  a  whole   with   a   couple   of   hot   spots   in   the   NW   and   SW   corners.   As   the   season   moved   into   peak   growth  in  late  July,  the  small  temporal  temperature  fluctuations  discussed  previously  can   be  seen  clearly.  The  maximum  temperatures  seen  on  July  21  and  25,  peak  at  9.3Â°C  whilst   48   hours   either   side,   the   temperatures   peak   at   4.7Â°C.   However,   there   are   still   small,   localized  cold  spots  within  the  center  of  the  field  site  and  to  the  south.  This  suggests  that   the   generalization   that   could   be   made   from   the   temporal   data   does   not   hold   true   for   the   entire   field   site.   Had   a   single   sample   site   within   the   center   of   the   plot   been   used   for   measuring  ST,  the  previous  variations  may  not  have  been  as  strong.     Considering   the   similar   variagrams   exhibitied   by   ST   and   AL,   the   kriged   results   should  also  show  similar  spatial  variability  patterns.  Within  Figure  3.7  it  can  be  seen  that   AL   depths   gradually   increase   through   spring   and   into   early   summer.   The   appearance   of   localized   hot   spots   of   increased   depths   once   again   occurs   in   the   NW   and   SW   corners   of   the   field   area.   This   seems   plausible   considering   the   relationship   of   increased   ST   with   more   thaw  and  therefore  increased  AL  depths.  Moving  into  late  summer  and  peak  growth  season,   the   AL   depth   continues   to   increase   as   expected,   but   the   appearance   of   isolated   shallower   and   deeper   regions   becomes   apparent.   The   center   points   create   an   area   of   shallower

depths   (<30   cm)   whilst   the   NW,   SW   and   NE   corners   are   hot   spots   for   much   deeper   AL   depths  (>50  cm).  This  shows  that  even  though  the  wetland  is  thawing  as  a  whole  and  AL   depths  are  deepening  throughout,  it  is  not  uniform  within  the  entire  field  area.     Finally,   Figure   3.8   shows   the   variations   in   SM   throughout   the   wetland.   Due   to   the   differences  in  variagram  analyses,  it  is  expected  that  the  patterns  of  variability  within  the   field   site   will   differ   from   that   seen   previously   within   ST   and   AL.   Looking   at   the   kriging   results  for  spring  and  early  summer,  a  general  increase  in  SM  is  seen  within  the  site  as  a   whole   as   thaw   and   snow   melt   increase   hydrological   input   into   the   wetland.   The   NW   and   SW   hot   spots   previously   seen   within   ST   and   AL   are   more   generalized   to   create   a   strong   E/W   trend   across   the   entire   wetland   with   the   eastern   side   containing   more   saturated   conditions   than   in   the   west.   As   the   season   progresses   into   peak   growth,   this   E/W   trend   continues.   The   increase   in   total   saturation   sites   verified   in   Figure   3.5   are   clearly   seen   moving   into   late   summer.   The   initial   spring   melt   of   the   snowpack   and   overflow   of   melt   water  in  June  is  seen  as  isolated  patches  of  intense  SM  that  spread  to  form  larger  areas  by   late   July.   The   western   side   of   the   field   plot   is   drier   and   is   also   the   area   associated   with   higher  ST  values  and  deeper  AL  thaw.  It  would  seem  plausible  that  perhaps  this  change  in   AL  depth  causes  the  ground  to  be  drier  by  increasing  the  soil's  storage  capacity.

The   DEM   for   this   area   allows   for   differences   in   slope,   elevation   and   aspect   to   be  

investigated.   Figure   3.9   is   an   elevation   map   and   shows   that   the   wetland   is   fairly   flat   in   topography   with   a   maximum   elevation   difference   of   only   9   m   (Figure   3.9).   The   aspect   analysis   produced   a   mean   of   191   degrees   meaning   that   most   of   the   wetland   is   facing   south   to  south  west.  Analysis  of  slope  showed  a  mean  of  4  degrees  with  a  maximum  value  of  16   degrees  implying  that  most  of  the  wetland  is  low  lying.  This  would  suggest  that,  overall,  the   wetland   slopes   predominantly   south   but   with   minimal   slope   and   a   total   rise   of   only   9m   between  the  SW  and  NE  corners.  It  would  seem  obvious  to  assume  that  the  wetland  should   then   drain   to   the   S   but   this   is   not   represented   within   the   SM   results   that   show   an   E/W   trend.      In  order  to  check  the  strength  of  the  models  that  were  fit  to  the  various  variagrams  

and   therefore   the   validity   of   the   kriged   surface   layers   in   their   value   predictions,   key   regression   statistics   were   calculated   that   show   how   valid   the   interpolated   values   are.   Validity  statistics  were  investigated  for  all  three  variables  and  presented  in  Table  3.2.  The   mean   prediction   error   (MPE)   is   a   measure   of   bias   and   needs   to   be   as   close   to   zero   as   possible.   The   root   mean   square   standardized   prediction   error   (RMSSPE)   is   a   measure   of   validity   and   should   be   as   close   to   one   as   possible   if   the   predicted   errors   are   valid.   The   root   mean  square  prediction  error  (RMSPE)  and  average  prediction  error  (APE)  represent  the   level   of   error   in   the   predicted   results   and   therefore   interpolated   surface.   They   should   both   be   as   small   as   possible   and   as   similar   to   each   other   as   possible.   From   Table   3.2   it   can   be   seen   that   for   all   surfaces   and   for   all   three   variables,   the   largest   MPE   was   0.06,   and   the   biggest  RMSSPE  was  1.13.  The  surfaces  created  for  ST  have  the  smallest  RMSPE  and  APE   with  SM  having  the  highest.  This  large  variation  in  values  and  non-spatial  heterogeneity  of

the   data   creates   these   larger   numbers,   as   this   data   does   not   show   strong   spatial   autocorrelation.  This  would  imply  that  SM  variability  has  a  greater  irregular  spatial  pattern   than   ST   or   AL.   Despite   the   larger   errors   associated   with   the   kriged   SM   surfaces,   the   ecological  variability  is  accurate.  The  patterns  shown  in  Figure  3.8  were  witnessed  during   sampling   where   a   strong   E/W   trend   was   clearly   apparent   during   the   spring   and   summer   2014  field  season.

   3.4. Discussion  

  

This   study   aimed   to   look   at   the   high   spatial   and   temporal   resolution   patterns   and   relationships   between   the   biophysical   variables   of   SM,   ST,   and   AL   within   a   nival   driven   High  Arctic  wetland  ecosystem.  It  was  found  that  when  looking  at  the  wetland  ecosystem  as   a  whole,  the  temporal  and  spatial  patterns  of  increasing  AL  depth,  increasing  and  erratic  ST   values   and   consistent   SM   levels   are   dominant   and   easy   to   identify.   However,   upon   closer   inspection,  it  is  clear  that  these  relationships  do  not  occur  throughout  the  entire  wetland   but   rather   spatial   variability   allows   for   inconsistencies   to   these   patterns.   The   spatial   pattern   analysis   shows   clearly   they   cannot   be   generalized   to   the   entire   wetland.   AL   and   ST   are   more   closely   inter-related   with   each   other   than   with   SM.   Similar   ST   and   AL   spatial   variability  patterns  are  seen  across  the  wetland  that  are  not  witnessed  as  clearly  within  the   SM  kriged  results.     The  changes  in  SM  regime  can  be  linked  to  the  presence  and  location  of  the  late  lying   snowbank   directly   north   of   the   wetland.   The   initial   spring   thaw   would   have   caused   a   massive   influx   of   meltwater   from   the   snowpack   that   must   have   washed   over   the   entire   wetland  similar  to  that  proposed  by  Thompson  and  Woo  (2009).  The  relatively  short  time   span   since   the   sample   sites   became   snow   free   would   have   allowed   for   very   little   thaw   to   take   place,   thus   inhibiting   percolation   of   this   meltwater   as   predicted   by   Roulet   and   Woo,

1986  and  Woo  and  Young  (2003).  SM  values  show  less  localization  to  individual  sites  and   more  so  to  general  areas.  It  is  likely  that  as  the  ground  is  thawing,  the  saturated  areas  are   able   to   spread   out   within   the   wetland.   In   addition,   it   must   not   be   forgotten,   that   during   the   summer   season   the   overlying   perennial   snow   pack   is   continuously   melting.   This   is   providing   a   steady   hydrological   input   that   is   not   limited   to   spring   only,   unlike   many   wetlands   that   form   within   topographic   depressions   or   beside   lakes   and   rivers   (Woo   &   Young,   2006).   With   this   steady,   reliable   influx   of   water   all   season   long,   the   general   saturation   of   the   wetland   exhibited   during   peak   growth   in   late   summer   is   easily   accounted   for.  Increasing  AL  depths  and  a  steady  influx  of  melt  water  allows  the  SM  values  within  this   wetland   to   remain   near   saturation   and   spread   westwards   as   the   summer   progresses.   It   should   also   be   noted   that   considering   the   importance   of   this   snowpack   resource   and   in   turn  the  wetland  itself  to  our  carbon  cycle,  any  changes  to  hydrological  input  will  directly   affect  the  SM  regime  of  the  wetland  ecosystem  (Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008).      However,  the  deep  AL  hot  spots  within  the  NW,  NE  and  SW  corners  of  the  wetland  

are   the   driest   in   regards   to   SM.   Perhaps   the   AL   depths   are   of   a   sufficient   level   that   saturation   is   not   possible   regardless   of   hydrological   input   strength.   Previous   studies   by   Woo  and  Young  (2003,  2006)  showed  AL  depths  of  less  than  1  m  in  High  Arctic  wetlands   that   are   continually   saturated.   The   sample   sites   located   within   the   center   of   the   wetland   have   comparably   shallower   AL   depths   up   to   half   of   the   maximum   recorded   depth   within   the  entire  field  site.  This  would  imply  that  perhaps  shallower  (~30  cm)  AL  depths  are  the   thresholds   for   saturated   conditions.   This   can   be   an   important   consideration   for   future   studies.  How  AL  depth  varies  across  a  wetland  where  vegetation  type  is  the  same,  incoming   solar  radiation  is  similar  and  a  reliable  hydrological  input  is  present  should  be  investigated

further.  Perhaps  soil  type  and  organic  layer  depth  is  key  in  determining  where  saturation  is   likely  and  how  it  will  spread  within  these  wetland  ecosystems.     It  was  noted  in  the  field  that  snow  cover  was  uniform  across  the  wetland  field  site   but   it   did   not   melt   at   a   uniform   rate.   In   fact,   the   NE   corner   was   the   slowest   to   melt   with   snow   cover   remaining   into   late   summer.   Once   the   overlying   snow   was   thawed,   this   site   thawed  quicker  with  deeper  AL  depths  and  higher  ST  values  than  sites  in  the  center  of  the   field   site   that   had   been   snow   free   since   spring.   Perhaps   this   late   lying   snow   cover   had   insulated  the  ground  to  a  sufficient  level  so  that  less  energy  was  needed  once  snow  free  for   this   area   of   wetland   to   reach   its   maximum   state   of   thaw.   However,   this   does   not   explain   how  the  sample   sites   that   were   snow  free  from  spring  did  not  achieve  deeper  AL  depths  or   higher   ST   values   compared   to   sites   that   were   snow   covered   for   a   longer   length   of   time.   Rouse  (2000)  wrote  that  saturated  soils  required  more  energy  to  heat  and  thaw  than  drier.   In  this  case  the  more  centrally  located  saturated  sites  that  were  snow  free  for  longer  would   require  more  energy  to  thaw  whilst  the  NE  corner  sites  that  have  lower  SM  values  needed   less  time  despite  being  snow  covered  for  longer.     From   a   temporal   perspective,   the   descriptive   statistics   within   each   data   set   imply   that   the   wetland   reaches   a   level   of   stability   in   late   July   during   peak   growth.   Despite   SM   remaining  similar  all  season,  AL  depth  increases  yet  thaw  rate  slows  whilst  ST  values  also   increase  and  subsequently  fluctuate.  This  is  similar  to  the  results  witnessed  by  Roulet  and   Woo   (1986)   and   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008).   Therefore   despite   a   set   of   results   showing   "strong   variance"   between   measured   values,   the   variance   percentage   decreased,   then   remained   at   a   consistent   level   marginally   above   30%   for   all   three   variables   during   late   summer.  This  means  that  the  difference  in  all  three  biophysical  variable  values  within  the

wetland   during   late   summer   has   less   diversity   than   during   spring   and   early   summer.   Spatially,   however,   the   range   of   values   does   not   decrease   across   the   wetland   but   more   sample  points  must  fall  around  the  average  for  each  set  in  order  for  the  variance  to  lower   to   a   comparatively   stable   level.   Thus   suggesting   that   the   wetland   is   more   stable   at   this   point  than  during  spring  and  early  summer  where  the  variance  was  over  70%  for  both  AL   and   ST.   From   these   results,   it   can   be   considered   that   if   any   point   sampling   were   to   be   done   in  future  studies  on  SM,  ST  and  AL,  late  summer  would  show  the  most  consistent  results  for   the  entire  wetland.     The  stronger  relationships  seen  between  SM,  ST  and  AL  mostly  disappear  by  peak   growth   and   late   summer   except   for   ST   and   AL   depth   which   remain   consistently   strong   throughout   both   spring   and   summer.   This   decrease   in   relationship   as   the   season   progresses  is  clearly  seen  in  the  reduced  regression  values  for  ST  vs.  SM  and  SM  vs.  AL.  This   would   then   suggest   that   the   wetland   becomes   less   stable   and   more   erratic,   or   perhaps   more  simply,  the  variables  cease  to  interact  once  the  season  progresses  into  late  summer.  It   can   be   hypothesized   that   perhaps   the   wetland   biophysical   values   remain   at   a   consistent   level   of   variability   during   peak   growth,   which   in   turn   allows   biomass   production   to   be   steady  at  this  time  and  therefore  ST,  AL  and  SM  to  behave  on  a  more  independent  level  and   not  be  driven  by  each  other  to  the  extent  previously  thought.     During  the  spring  and  early  thaw,  variability  within  the  wetland  is  high  as  different   areas  emerge  and  thaw  at  different  rates,  but  by  late  summer  the  wetland  has  established   itself   and   so   variability   between   values   lowers.   If   the   interactions   show   such   strong   relationships  during  spring  and  these  fade  into  summer  and  peak  growth,  perhaps  they  are   only   closely   related   during   this   time.   When   the   wetland   is   established   and   biomass

production  is  at  its  peak  during  the  end  of  July,  perhaps  ST,  AL,  and  SM  operate  separately   and  have  reached  their  optimum  values.  It  should  also  be  considered  that  any  changes  to   any  variable  during  the  beginning  of  the  season  would  affect  the  others  at  a  greater  level   than   later   on.   Future   studies   may   perhaps   explore   how   these   variables   and   relationships   change  as  the  season  finishes  with  sampling  continuing  into  August.  It  would  be  expected   that  as  air  temperatures  cool  along  with  reduced  solar  radiation  levels,  the  wetland  would   start  to  re-freeze  and  the  broken  thaw  pattern  witnessed  during  spring  would  once  again   be   apparent   during   fall.   Perhaps   the   relationships   observed   in   spring   and   early   summer   will   become   apparent   once   more   as   the   wetland   de-stabilizes   and   re-freezes.   The   Arctic   wetland   study   by   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   continued   though   to   August   where   the   researchers   mention   the   area   undergoing   "fall   senescence"   when   the   plants   stop   functioning   biologically   and   begin   to   freeze   for   winter.   It   was   shown   that   ST   values   decrease   gradually   as   observed   during   spring   and   AL   depth   stops   increasing.   In   fact,   AL   depths   were   not   seen   to   increase   until   September   within   the   study   by   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008).   However,   as   mentioned,   this   study   did   not   take   into   consideration   spatial   variability  therefore  future  studies  into  greater  temporal  and  spatial  analysis  of  how  a  High   Arctic  wetland  re-freezes  during  autumn  are  required.        3.5. Conclusions   The  results  of  this  study  show  that  the  three  biophysical  variables  of  SM,  ST  and  AL  vary   both  spatially  and  temporally  within  an  Arctic  thaw  season.  The  variation  in  values  within   the   wetland   decreases   temporally   from   spring   to   late   summer,   thus   implying   a   degree   of   stability  during  peak  growth/late  summer.  The  moderately  average  relationships  between      49  

the   biophysical   variables   reduces   to   non-   existent   as   the   season   progresses,   once   again   promoting  the  idea  of  a  steady  wetland  ecosystem  late  in  the  summer  season.     The  changes  spatially  show  that  uniform  variability  is  not  present  but  rather  localized   to  NE,  NW  and  SW  hot  spots  on  the  perimeter  of  the  wetland  along  with  a  strong  E/W  SM   trend.   The   moderately   similar   ST   and   AL   spatial   patterns   coupled   with   their   strong   regression   relationships   throughout   the   season   imply   that   this   is   the   only   variable   association   to   remain   throughout   the   spring   and   summer   season   within   a   wetland   ecosystem.   Further   study   is   needed   into   how   these   interactions,   variations   and   spatial   patterns  change  during  August  and  whether  these  relationships  once  again  become  more   apparent  as  erratic  re-freezing  becomes  evident.

4. Discussion  
4.1.  Spatial  and  temporal  biophysical  interactions   The   manuscript   presented   in   the   previous   chapter   helped   answer   the   research   question   of   this   thesis   by   examining   the   spatial   changes   and   temporal   patterns   of   relationships   between   the   biophysical   variables   of   SM,   ST,   and   AL   within   a   nival-driven   High   Arctic   wetland   ecosystem.   The   main   results   and   conclusions   from   the   previous   outlined   study   show   that   the   wetland   ecosystem   is   erratic   and   highly   variable   during   spring   thaw   with   rough,   loosely   linked   relationships   between   all   three   biophysical   variables.  These  loose  relationships  seen  temporally  during  spring  melt  were  increased  soil   temperatures   with   decreased   soil   moisture   values   and   increased   soil   moisture   saturation   with   decreased   thaw   depth.   A   strong   trend   of   increased   thaw   depth   with   increasing   soil   temperature   values   was   showcased   throughout   the   entire   sampling   season.   These   relationships  dissolve  by  peak  growth  in  late  summer  as  the  wetland  somewhat  stabilizes   and   variance   between   values   decreases.   It   is   spatially   evident   that   the   wetland   does   not   exhibit   similar   patterns   of   variance   between   variables   with   ST   and   AL   showing   clear   localized  hot  spots  for  increased  values  within  the  NW,  SE  and  NE  corners  whilst  SM  shows   a  general  E/W  trend  across  the  entire  wetland.  These  conclusions  as  well  as  the  discussions   and  analyses  previously  addressed  within  chapter  three,  help  answer  the  central  research   question  and  hypotheses  of  this  thesis  as  set  out  in  chapter  one.        RESEARCH  HYPOTHESES

HP1-  As  the  thaw  season  progresses,  AL  will  increase  in  depth  and  sites  farther  from   the  snowbank  will  thaw  sooner  than  sites  closest  lending  to  a  pattern  of  decreasing  AL  depths   towards  the  snowbank.      AL   depth   did   increase   during   the   season   as   predicted   and   similar   to   research   by   Roulet   and   Woo   (1986a,   1986b),   Glen   and   Woo   (1997),   Woo   and   Young   (2003,   2006),   Nobrega  and  Grogan  (2008),  and  Abnizova  and  Young  (2010).  However,  it  can  be  seen  from   the   spatial   analysis   that   AL   depth   clearly   does   increase   as   the   season   progresses   but   not   in   the  pattern  suggested  by  Woo  and  Young  (2003,  2006).  There  is  no  N/S  trend  of  AL  depth   exhibited  within  this  field  site  but  rather  localized  hot  spots  of  deeper  thaw  depths  within   the  NW,  SW  and  NE  corners.  This  pattern  is  not  similar  to  the  overlying  snowpack  as  the   NW  quadrant  was  snow  free  in  spring  whilst  sites  in  the  NE  corner  remained  under  snow   until   peak   growth   and   yet   showed   a   comparable   AL   depth   to   other   sites   once   thawing   began.   The   corners   with   increased   thaw   are   on   the   edges   of   the   wetland   with   the   center   sites  showing  the  shallowest  AL  values.  These  corner  sites  were  also  the  driest  of  the  field   area   lending   to   the   idea   that   perhaps   the   middle   section   of   the   snow   pack,   which   remained   all   summer,   is   thicker   and   thus   contains   more   water   for   a   stronger   hydrological   input.   This   would   reinforce   the   research   by   Rouse   (2000)   that   these   more   saturated   areas   require   a   greater  latent  heat  to  thaw  to  a  greater  depth  than  the  drier  corner  areas  where  snow  cover   was   less   as   the   snowpack   decreased   above   it.   It   would   seem   prudent   to   suggest   that   perhaps  instead  of  an  AL  pattern  linked  to  distance  from  the  snowpack,  there  is  instead  a   pattern  of  AL  depth  linked  to  proximity  to  greatest  snowpack  depth  and  melt  and  therefore   increased  SM  saturation.

      HP2-   A   link   between   ST   and   SM   will   be   apparent   with   drier   soils   exhibiting   higher   average  ST  values  than  saturated  sites.      Overall,   the   temporal   ST   relationship   was   increasing   values   through   spring   and   early  summer  before  fluctuating  every  48  hours  in  peak  growth.  This  pattern  is  similar  to   that   witnessed   by   Roulet   and   Woo   (1986a,   1986b)   and   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   who   suggested  a  surge  in  ST  values  in  spring  followed  by  a  plateau  during  peak  growth  before   returning   to   freezing.   Interestingly,   the   relationship   of   high   ST   and   decreased   SM,   as   interpreted   from   Rouse   (2000),   differs   depending   on   whether   a   spatial   or   a   temporal   analysis  is  studied  within  the  wetland.       Temporally,   this   relationship   was   only   apparent   during   spring   melt   and   quickly   deteriorated   as   the   season   progressed.   Regression   values   for   this   variable   association   decreased  from  0.41  to  0.06.  As  the  wetland  thawed,  the  variance  of  points  became  more   spread   out   and   a   greater   range   of   temperatures   was   experienced.   This   caused   the   relationship  to  disappear.  During  peak  growth,  the  temperature  fluctuations  meant  a  lower   variance   between   points   as   more   now   fell   around   an   average.   As   the   temperature   fluctuated,  the  wetland  as  a  whole  would  increase  and  decrease  in  temperature.  However,   due   to   the   widespread   saturated   SM   values   throughout   the   wetland   that   do   not   respond   to   differences  in  air  temperature,  the  relationship  of  SM  and  ST  would  not  hold.  It  was  found   that   during   late   summer   when   ST   fluctuated   every   two   days,   the   warmer   days   showed   a   stronger   relationship   of   ST   to   SM   (R2   of   0.24)   than   colder   days   (R2   of   0.01).   This   would

suggest   that   higher   ST   values   have   a   stronger   relationship   with   saturated   SM   readings,   opposite  to  what  was  suggested  in  HP2.     However,   spatially,   it   can   be   seen   that   the   hot   spots   of   increased   ST   values   were   seen   in   the   NW   and   SW   corners   along   with   an   E/W   trend   of   decreasing   SM   saturation   leading   to   the   impression   that   increased   temperatures   do   have   lower   SM   values.   If   a   closer   examination  is  taken  of  individual  sites  in  these  locations,  it  can  be  seen  that  HP2  is  correct   and   areas   with   low   SM   values   have   higher   than   average   ST   readings.   This   result   emphasizes   the   importance   of   conducting   both   a   spatial   and   temporal   analysis,   as   had   temporal   data   alone   been   used,   generalizing   the   relationship   would   have   resulted   in   a   rejection  of  the  hypothesis,  but  spatially  and  individually,  many  sites  accept  the  hypothesis.        HP3-  ST  will  be  seen  to  vary  directly  according  to  incoming  solar  radiation  values.      The   two-day   time   lag   proposed   by   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008)   between   solar   radiation   and   ST   values   was   not   seen   in   this   field   study   as   it   can   be   clearly   seen   that   ST,   air   temperature   and   solar   radiation   fluctuations   match   during   peak   growth.   Temporally   this   hypothesis  can  only  be  accepted  for  a  small  portion  of  the  season.  During  spring  and  early   summer,   incoming   solar   radiation   values   fluctuate   yet   ST   steadily   increases.   This   links   into   the  theory  identified  by  this  study  of  the  wetland  establishing  itself  during  the  beginning  of   the   season   before   stabilizing   in   late   summer.   During   the   last   two   weeks   of   summer,   ST   begins   to   fluctuate   along   with   air   temperature   values   and   solar   radiation   measurements,   thus  agreeing  with  the  hypothesis.

   HP4-  SM  will  not  vary  with  time  across  the  study  site  and  most  sites  will  show  complete   saturation   due   to   limited   drainage   and   the   presence   of   small   AL   depths   due   to   the   continuous   hydrological  input  from  the  perennial  snowbank  at  this  location.      This  hypothesis  can  be  split  into  both  a  spatial  and  temporal  assumption.  The  first,   that  SM  did  not  change  temporally  for  the  entire  wetland  as  witnessed  by  Woo  and  Young   (2006),   and   Nobrega   and   Grogan   (2008),   and   second,   that   spatially   the   wetland   showed   widespread   saturated   conditions   due   to   continual   hydrological   input   from   the   melting   perennial  snowpack.     Temporally,   there   were   minimal   changes   in   SM   values   during   the   season   as   also   witnessed  by  Woo  and  Young  (2006),  and  Nobrega  and  Grogan  (2008).  In  this  site,  average   SM   values   show   a   generally   consistent   temporal   pattern   throughout   spring   and   summer   because   of   the   existence   of   the   perennial   snowbank   feeding   the   wetland   allowing   for   a   steady  hydrological  input.  However,  at  the  individual  level,  spatial  changes  show  that  not   each   site   remained   at   a   consistent   SM   level   throughout   the   sampling   season.   For   the   whole   site,   a   general   E/W   trend   remained   throughout   spring   and   summer,   however   the   extent   that   this   trend   changed   as   the   wetland   thawed   into   late   summer.   This   shows   that   some   temporal   differences   exist   with   sample   sites   in   the   NE   corner   showing   a   decreased   in   saturated   value   during   peak   growth   compared   to   spring   whilst   sites   in   the   SE   show   an   increase  in  SM  saturation.     Spatially,  the  presence  of  an  E/W  trend  was  not  anticipated  by  this  study  as  limited   research   has   been   previously   done   on   the   differing   tundra   and   AL   depths   within   this

particular  wetland  field  site  that  likely  caused  this  trend.  The  shallower  AL  depths  within   the   center   of   the   wetland   lend   themselves   to   increased   saturation   as   suggested   by   Rouse   (2000)   and   there   are   many   areas   of   complete   saturation   that   remained   all   season   as   expected.   The   kriged   results   show   slight   variations   between   sets,   especially   during   peak   growth.  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  temperature  fluctuations  also  seen  at  this  time  with   peaks   in   solar   radiation   and   air   temperature   causing   increased   snowmelt,   but   without   studying  changes  in  melt  rates,  this  cannot  be  proven.  All  moisture  sampling  was  taken  at   the  same  time  every  48  hours,  therefore  changes  in  sampling  time  cannot  account  for  this   pattern   either.   It   is   also   possible   that   these   slight   changes   can   be   attributed   to   possible   errors   in   interpolation   due   to   the   high   variability   in   SM   values   and   lack   of   spatial   autocorrelation   across   the   site.   The   statistical   results   for   SM   kriging   show   that   whilst   having   a   high   standard   deviation   value   for   each   set,   the   mean   remained   relatively   high   and   similar   all   season,   keeping   the   coefficient   of   variance   at   ~30%.   However,   the   spatial   statistical  values  emphasize  how  variable  the  data  is  spatially.  Therefore,  despite  having  a   lower   variance   to   ST   and   AL,   SM   has   a   greater   spatial   variability   and   poorer   spatial   autocorrelation   across   the   wetland.   Overall,   the   SM   remained   similar   all   season   with   a   strong  E/W  trend  and  widespread  saturation  of  many  sites.        4.2.  Wetlands  and  climate  change   The   wetland   within   this   study   was   fed   by   a   strong   hydrological   input   from   an   overlying   perennial   snowbank   for   the   entire   2014   field   season.   Wetlands   can   form   in   topographic   depressions,   adjacent   to   lakes   and   rivers,   within   coastal   environments,   and   be   fed  by  a  strong  ground  water  supply  as  well  as  by  snowpacks  (Woo  &  Young,  2003).  The      56  

variety   of   hydrological   settings   under   which   environmental   conditions   are   conducive   to   wetland  formation  make  it  likely  that  the  biophysical  traits  within  each  type  will  differ  in   spatial  and  temporal  pattern.  In  this  study,  the  presence  of  a  season  long  hydrological  input   is   a   key   feature   allowing   for   widespread   saturated   conditions   even   after   peak   melt   in   spring.   The   limited   rain   throughout   June   and   July   is   seen   to   have   little   effect   on   the   SM   regime,  further  enhancing  the  knowledge  that  constant  snowpack  melt  is  required  for  the   continuation   of   this   type   of   wetland.   The   plant   species   native   to   these   ecosystems   are   a   combination   of   mosses   and   sedge   grasses   that   thrive   in   saturated   conditions   (Walker,   2000;   Walker   et   al.,   2005;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2012,   2013).   It   can   then   be   considered   that   any  changes  to  the  wetland's  moisture  regime  will  directly  affect  the  vegetation.  As  this  is   ultimately  the  primary  mechanism  for  carbon  sequestration  into  the  ground,  the  continual   growth   and   development   of   this   biome   is   extremely   important   (Dag   &   Lafleur,   2011;   Elmendorf   et   al.,   2012;   Atkinson   &   Treitz,   2012,   2013).   Continually   increasing   temperatures   will   cause   a   net   decrease   in   snowpack   volume   over   time   (Screen   &   Simmonds,   2012)   as   increased   melt   in   summer   combined   with   shorter   winters   and   less   snow   will   reduce   the   final   volume   of   snowpack   available   for   hydrological   input   every   thaw   season  (Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2013).     It  can  be  seen  how  variable  SM  is  from  the  results  given  in  the  previous  chapter.  In  a   predominantly  nutrient  poor  environment,  any  sources  of  nitrogen  (a  limiting  nutrient  for   plant   growth)   are   key.   Within   this   ecosystem   the   production   of   Nostoc   (a   nitrogen-fixing   bacteria)   helps   drive   the   existence   of   these   wetland   plant   communities   (Woo   &   Young,   2003,  2006;  Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012).  The  differential  pattern  in  variability  of  SM  to  ST  and

AL  imply  that  simply  monitoring  one  variable  cannot  accurately  predict  where  SM  will  be   prevalent.   Along   with   affecting   SM   regimes   and   therefore   plant   growth   and   photosynthesis   production,   changes   in   climate   and   increased   warming   will   disturb   the   permafrost   distribution   (Shuur   et   al.,   2009;   Tarnocai   et   al.,   2009).   Within   this   study   alone,   a   maximum   difference  in  AL  depth  of  approximately  60  cm  is  seen  at  this  small-scale  level.  Polar  desert   environments  typically  have  AL  depths  >1  m  (Nobrega  &  Grogan,  2008;  Wang  et  al.,  2011)   and  the  NW,  SW,  and  NE  hotpots  within  this  wetland  had  AL  depths  approaching  70  cm.  By   peak   growth   and   the   end   of   the   sampling   season,   many   central   sites   had   AL   depths   around   30  cm  on  average.  Scientists  predict  that  Arctic  warming  will  continue  to  rise  over  the  next   decade   (Schellnhuber   &   Cramer,   2006).   This   would   not   only   alter   the   volume   and   extent   of   the   snowpacks   previously   mentioned,   but   would   increase   AL   depths   resulting   in   permafrost   thaw.   Thawing   will   release   the   stores   of   carbon   sequestered   beneath   these   wetlands  and  also  allow  for  more  microbial  respiration  and  decay  producing  more  CO2  and   CH4.   A   changing   climate   will   therefore   affect   these   wetlands   in   many   ways   and   likely   affect   their  crucial  sink  status  (Atkinson  &  Treitz,  2012).         4.3.  Future  considerations   It  has  been  mentioned  how  important  it  is  to  have  consistent,  saturated  conditions   for  wetland  production  and  existence.  Changes  in  climate  are  no  longer  a  question  of  if  and   when,   but   rather   to   what   extent.   This   research   investigates   how   a   wetland   ecosystem   establishes  itself  every  thaw  season  and  how  SM,  ST  and  AL  interact  with  each  other  during   that   time.   What   is   not   explicitly   known   is   how   this   will   be   affected   by   climate.   Future      58  

studies  should  consider  investigating  how  a  wetland  endures  and  changes  under  different   projected  climate  scenarios.     For   one,   investigating   how   increased   AL   depths   may   affect   SM   regimes   within   a   wetland   needs   greater   investigation.   Studying   the   differing   soil   types   and   depth   extent   of   mineral   and   organic   soils   could   help   explain   patterns   in   SM.   If   organic   layer   depth   is   similar,  perhaps  there  is  an  AL  depth  threshold  after  which  SM  saturation  greatly  reduces.   In   addition,   it   may   be   interesting   to   explore   what   happens   to   these   three   biophysical   variables  after  peak  growth.  Looking  at  how  the  relationships  and  variance  between  values   changes   during   re-freezing.   Perhaps   the   same   broken   pattern   of   thaw   will   be   exhibited   during  freezing.  The  stability  that  the  wetland  has  during  peak  growth  will  likely  dissolve   and  highly  variable  values  will  once  again  appear.  The  loose  relationships  between  ST,  SM   and   AL   may   once   again   appear.   This   would   help   characterize   the   wetland   throughout   an   entire   season   from   spring   to   autumn.   If   climate   warming   continues   to   affect   lengths   of   Arctic   seasons,   knowing   how   these   important   ecosystems   change   and   act   during   current   spring,   summer   and   autumn   seasons   will   allow   projections   to   be   made   if   they   were   to   change.   It   can   also   be   considered   that   if   the   relationships   between   variables   are   stronger   during  spring,  any  effect  to  one  may  affect  the  others.  Knowing  how  SM,  ST  and  AL  interact   under  a  variety  of  conditions  is  key  in  investigating  this  further.     Finally,  are  the  spatial  and  temporal  results  seen  within  this  study  similar  across  the   wetland   ecosystem   regardless   of   hydrological   regime?   Arctic   wetlands   form   under   a   variety   of   conditions   (Woo   &   Young,   2003)   but   all   are   closely   linked   to   a   strong   hydrological  resource  that  provides  consistently  saturated  conditions.  These  sources  are  all   similarly   linked   to   climate   like   the   perennial   snowbank   is   within   this   study.   How   these

driving   biophysical   variables   operate   within   different   wetland   environments   will   help   investigate  how  climate  changes  could  affect  all  the  different  wetland  ecosystems  spatially   and  temporally.

5. Conclusion  
Temporal  sampling  was  completed  every  two  days  at  55  single  sample  sites  within  a   High   Arctic   wetland.   The   concluding   temporal   results   showed   a   decrease   in   relationships   between   SM,   ST   and   AL   as   the   season   progressed,   as   well   as   a   decrease   in   variability   of   values   across   the   wetland.   Spatially,   it   was   concluded   that   generalizing   temporal   relationships  across  the  wetland  could  not  be  done  as  localized  hot  spots  of  increased  AL   and   ST   values   appeared   in   the   NW,   SW   and   NE   corners   of   the   wetland   as   well   as   a   clear   E/W  trend  in  SM  across  the  entire  site.  It  can  be  hypothesized  that  during  spring  melt,  the   wetland   exhibits   a   patchy   thaw   pattern   that   continues   until   peak   growth   in   late   summer   where   it   reaches   a   level   of   stability   with   less   variance   across   the   site   and   the   biophysical   variables  working  almost  independently.   The   loose   relationships   seen   temporally   during   spring   melt   were   increased   soil   temperatures   with   decreased   soil   moisture   values   and   increased   soil   moisture   saturation   with   decreased   thaw   depth.   A   strong   trend   of   increased   thaw   depth   with   increasing   soil   temperature   values   was   showcased   throughout   the   entire   sampling   season.   It   was   seen   spatially  that  these  relationships  do  not  exist  within  the  entire  wetland  and  so  conducting   both  a  spatial  and  temporal  study  is  necessary  for  future  research  in  this  area.     It   is   necessary   to   investigate   these   wetland   ecosystems   and   how   they   change   seasonally  in  order  to  make  predictions  as  to  how  they  may  be  affected  under  a  changing   climate.   Considering   their   importance   within   our   global   carbon   cycle   and   their   key   sink   status   in   sequestering   carbon   through   photosynthesis,   this   study   aims   to   contribute   to   this   field  and  help  understand  more  about  these  fragile  yet  essential  ecosystems.
