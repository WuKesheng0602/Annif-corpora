Abstract
There is a great desire to relate the patterns of endogenous peptides in blood to human disease and drug response. The best practices for the preparation of blood fluids for analysis are not clear and also relatively few of the peptides in blood have been identified by tandem mass spectrometry. We compared a number of sample preparation methods to extract endogenous peptides including C18 reversed phase, precipitation, and ultrafiltration. We examined the results of these sample preparation methods by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and

liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using MALDI-TOF/TOF and electrospray ionization-ion trap. Peptides from solid-phase extraction with C18 in the range of hundreds of femtomoles per spot were detected from the equivalent of 1 µL of serum by MALDI-TOF. We observed endogenous serum peptides from fibrinogen - and -chain, complement C3, -2-HS-glycoprotein, albumin, serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, factor VIII, plasminogen, immunoglobulin, and other abundant blood proteins. However, we also recorded significant MS/MS spectra from tumor necrosis factor--, major histocompatibility complex-, and angiotensin-related peptides, as well

as peptides from collagens and other lowabundance proteins. Amino acid substitutions were detected and a phosphorylated peptide was also observed.

endogenous peptides of fetal serum have been examined by MS and where peptides from low-abundance proteins, phosphopeptides, and amino acid substitutions were detected.

Introduction
A mass spectrometer (MS) can be used to identify the peptides in serum, plasma, or other biological fluids (1,2) as an aid in diagnosis of disease or to identify physiologically relevant molecules (3,4). The patterns of low-molecular mass peptides in samples from normal and diseased populations have been compared using time-of-flight (TOF) MS of unfractionated serum bound to a chromatographic surface on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target (5). The peptide/protein patterns in unfractionated serum have been shown to vary considerably during sample handling making their clinical use as biomarkers difficult (6). Serum fractionated by C18 partition chromatography produced peptide patterns by MALDI-TOF in agreement with classical biochemical and immunological investigations (7). Some of the endogenous peptides from serum have been identified by tandem MS (MS/MS) (7­10). Fetal serum contains growth factors that can stimulate cell lines to grow in culture. Some of these factors might be low-molecular mass polypeptides. Proteolytic fragments of larger molecules that circulate in the blood may have profound regulatory effects. For example, the proteolytic processing of collagen and related molecules produces fragments with roles in angiogenesis, cell growth, and complex regulatory processes that remain to be better defined (11). Proteolytic processing of fibrinogens releases fragments that have been associated

with acute events, such as coronary thrombosis (12) or the effects of cancer (13­15). To date, there has been no comparison of the methods used to extract polypeptides from blood fluids for MS/MS analysis. Richter et al. used hemofiltrate depleted of larger proteins to construct a database of circulating human peptides (16). Reversed-phase chromatography has been used to efficiently collect peptides for serum profiling (3,7,17). Polypeptides have also been isolated by precipitation with organic solvents (10) or from the carrier protein albumin (18,19). Recently, membrane filter plates have been used to solid-phase extract (SPE) the endogenous peptides from serum prior to identification using TOF/TOF (9). A key step in developing such methodology will be to determine what pool of peptides in serum are bound to carrier proteins, such as albumin (18­20). We compared sample preparation methods for detecting peptides from serum by MS. Polypeptides from fetal serum were extracted by a variety of methods and compared by MALDI-TOF MS prior to liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI)-ion trap and MALDI-TOF/ TOF identification.

Materials
1. Tissue culture grade fetal bovine calf serum was obtained from GIBCO (Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and is produced by rapid clotting in bags, separation, and cooling to near freezing point followed by utrafiltration. We did not subsequently heat inactivate the serum. 2. Magnetic beads with C18, SAX, WAX, SCX, HIC, and other bonded phases were obtained from Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, NJ).

3. C18 resins were also obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA) or Vydac (Hesperia, CA). 4. Amicon ultrafiltration membranes were obtained from Millipore. 5. Capillary C18 reversed-phase columns were obtained from Vydac. 6. P10 gel, DEAE-Blue resin, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrphoresis standards were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). 7. Solvents were obtained from Caledon Laboratories (Georgetown, Ontario, Canada). 8. Cibacron blue resin and all other salts and reagents were obtained from Sigma-AldrichFluka (St. Louis, MO) except where indicated.

were diluted in binding buffer for immobilization onto 100 µL of C18 resin-packed volume and then eluted in 100 µL. Two microliters of the eluant (equivalent to 1 µL of serum) were spotted on MALDI plates. Alternatively, the eluate was dried in a speed vac.

Organic Solvent Precipitation
Serum samples were precipitated with 5 vol of acetonitrile on ice for 15 min prior to spinning at 12,000g for 15 min (10). The supernatant and pellet were separated and the supernatant was dried under vacuum. Some samples were treated with 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) prior to organic solvent precipitation or SPE with C18.

Methods
Chromatography
Capacities were calculated and loading and elution conditions were in accordance with manufacturer's instructions except where indicated. Partition chromatography and SPE with C18 reversed-phase resin was run by gravity drip except where indicated.

Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation
Serum was precipitated using 4 vol of saturated ammonium sulfate on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000g for 15 min. The supernatant and pellet were collected into separate tubes.

Dye Affinity Chromatography Preparative C18 Chromatography
Batch chromatographic separations with C18 magnetic beads were performed according the manufacturer's instructions and buffers (Bruker), as previously described (17). Briefly, beads were equilibrated with the appropriate binding buffer before incubation in a volume of serum (equal to the packed volume) diluted in 10 vol of binding buffer. The serum sample was mixed with binding buffer and bound to the beads before washing in the binding buffer. Beads were collected with a magnetic 96-well plate holder before eluting with the appropriate buffer and collecting the eluant from the magnetic plate into 1-mL centrifuge tubes. Brief centrifugation at 12,000g ensured complete removal of particles. To accurately estimate the peptides in the equivalent of 1-µL of serum and for loading gels, 50 µL of serum DEAE-Blue and Cibacron Blue resins were loaded with sample in hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 40 mM NaCl) or physiological buffer (1X phosphate-buffered saline[PBS], pH 7.3) before washing in loading buffer and elution with 1 M NaCl, as previously described (21).

Size Exclusion Chromatography
P10- and G25-size exclusion media were used in the batch mode. Serum or serum diluted fivefold in water or PBS was equilibrated with an equal volume of exclusion media on ice. The resin was collected by brief centrifugation, rapidly resuspended in water, repelleted, and the superanatant discarded. The resin was then resuspended in an equal volume of water and allowed to equilibrate on a Ferris wheel for 15 min before collecting the

supernatant. The process was repeated twice to yield three fractions. The peptides were then loaded on gels or collected over C18 for MALDI or LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis.

Liquid Chromatography-Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry
Endogenous peptide samples collected from prefractionation schemes were analyzed over a 30-min gradient from 5 to 65% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 2 mL/min with an Agilent 1100 series capillary pump through an Agilent 150 × 0.3 mm capillary C18 column. Peptides were separated onto a stainless steel MALDI plate for Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/ TOF analysis, as described here previously. MS/MS spectra were collected using CHCA as a matrix.

Ultrafiltration
Amicon ultrafiltration membranes were used as previously described (20). Briefly, sera were diluted to a final concentration of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, with 20% v/v acetonitrile. The solution was ultrafiltered through YM 30-kDa nominal molecular-weight-limit filters under centrifugation at 12,000g and the filtrate was collected by C18 (20).

Correlation Analysis Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry
Endogenous peptide samples collected from all prefractionation schemes were prepared for MALDI analysis by collection over C18 reversed phase resin and spotted onto a stainless steel target for an Ultraflex MALDITOF/TOF (Bruker). The eluted peptides were dried onto stainless steel targets and, after allowing all the samples to dry evenly, the energy-absorbing matrix cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) was applied for collection of MS spectra. An automatic acquisition mode was used to collect data from the various treatments under identical parameters. The resulting ESI-MS/MS spectra were analyzed by X-Tandem (22) with ­1 Da and +3 Da from parent peptide as tolerance of the parent mass or likely isotopes in the search parameters and 0.4 Da error in the fragments. The MALDIMS/MS data were searched by MASCOT (23) with the default settings. The default-expected value for significance by X-Tandem is E-1, but in this study we only accepted peptides with a score of E-2 or lower. The database was the bovine RefSeq database downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Because no exogenous enzymes were used to digest these samples, we performed the search with no enzyme. Searches of nonphysiological databases yielded few significant hits at these expectation values.

Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry
Endogenous peptide samples collected from all prefractionation schemes were prepared for ESI analysis by collection over C18 reversedphase resin and analyzed over a 90-min gradient from 5 to 65% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 2 mL/min with an Agilent 1100 series capillary pump (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) through an Agilent 150 × 0.3 mm C18 column. Peptides separated by capillary high-performance LC were ionized via a metal needle electrospray head in a Bruker HCT 100 ion trap.

Results
Serum was prepared by SPE with C18 reversed phase or by precipitation with acetonitrile or ammonium sulfate. We compared the profile of the polypeptides in the extracts. We also examined serum dealbuminized with DEAE-Blue and Cibacron Blue dye-binding resins. Size exclusion chromatography resins, such as P10 and G25, and ultrafiltration membranes were also compared. The extracts from these methods were further treated with C18

but the signal-to-noise ratios were much higher in the pellet by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 2A,B).

Ammonium Sulfate
Proteins from ammonium sulfate precipitates typically retain enzyme activity and, therefore, are not strongly denatured. A wide range of peptides were observed in the supernatant and showed some differences with the pool of peptides in the pellet, but the major peptides were shared and there were much higher signal-tonoise ratios in the pellet (Fig. 2C,D).

reversed phase prior to LC-MS/MS. The LCMS/MS was performed by both LC-ion trap and LC-TOF-TOF.

Solid Phase Extraction With C18
We examined the collection of serum peptides with C18 for extraction from the solid phase before resolution on MALDI-TOF. We observed that DTT treatment prior to SPE altered a few aspects of the MALDI-TOF spectrum (not shown). We found that reversed phase extraction of nonreduced samples could be used to produce samples that permitted the direct detection of endogenous peptides when the sample was deposited on a single MALDI target spot (Fig. 1).

We determined if endogenous peptides were selectively bound to albumin by dye affinity chromatography in hypotonic (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 40 mM NaCl) and physiological buffers (1X PBS, pH 7.4) using both DEAE Blue and Cibacron Blue resin. We observed that many peptides eluted in the bovine serum albumin (BSA)-depleted fraction of serum that flowed through the dyebinding column. MALDI-TOF MS of the flow-through and retained fractions showed that the dye resin did not selectively retain many peptides (Fig. 2E,F) (Cibacron Blue result shown).

Size Exclusion
The components of fetal bovine serum were separated on the basis of their capacity to penetrate the size exclusion resins P10 and G25. A similar range of peptides was observed in the fraction that penetrated the beads compared to the fraction that did not penetrate the beads (Fig. 2G,H) (P10 result shown).

Comparison of Methods Acetonitrile Precipitation
We precipitated serum with acetonitrile and compared the polypeptides in the supernatant vs the pellet, by MALDI-TOF (10). About 1 µg of protein and peptides was collected by reversed-phase C18 resin and loaded on metal plates with CHCA matrix. We observed the presence of peptides in the organic supernatant

Ultrafiltration
To determine if peptides could be separated from high-mass components, we employed ultrafiltation with and without the presence of 20% acetonitrile. The presence of acetonitrile did not seem to affect strongly the distribution or intensity of small peptides (Fig. 2I,J).

We compared the spectra from 1 µL of serum to that of the matrix alone and observed that the matrix ions were not prominently displayed in the MALDI spectra of serum. The use of an equivalent to 1 µL of serum resulted in robust detection; no significant advantage was observed with amounts larger than 5 µL.

Analyte Detection Limit
We used a human fibrinogen  peptide as both an external and internal standard to estimate the levels of endogenous bovine fibrinogen  peptides in 2 µL of serum on a MALDI target spot. We observed that as little as 25 fmol of the human Glu-fibrinogen peptide (EGVNDNEEGFFSAR) could be detected in the serum peptide mixture, along with other peptides, including those of a bovine fibrinogen -chain peptide (QFPTDYDEGQDDRP). We observed that 300­400 fmol of the Glu-fibrinogen peptide provided roughly a similar response compared to the endogenous fibrinogen -chain peptide from the equivalent of 2 µL of serum (Fig. 4A). When the instrument was externally standardized with purified human Glu-fibrinogen, we observed roughly the same response from 100 fmol of the human Glu-fibrinogen as the endogenous levels of bovine  fibrinogen peptide. In a separate experiment, we confirmed the presence of  fibrinogen peptides by LC-ESI. In Fig. 4B,C, we show one of the most intense ions that mapped to fibrinogen B peptide and the fragmentation spectra showing +1 ions that matched well with the predicted series from the peptide TDYDEGQDDRP.

The protein concentrations of the various fractions are shown in Table 1.

Sample Detection Limit
In general, the C18 method was the simplest and fastest way to collect peptides from serum. We found that the majority of peptides in serum were observed at less than m/z 2300 (Fig. 3A). We examined the sensitivity of detecting serum peptides and found that peptides extracted from the equivalent of 1 µL of serum produced strong signal-to-noise ratios and showed a complex peptide mass distribution with many analytes well resolved by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 3B).

MALDI Reproducibility
We recorded the MALDI-TOF spectra of peptides collected from serum by SPE with

C18 chromatography (Fig. 5). The peptides that eluted from reversed-phase resin with 25% acetonitrile prominently included fibrinogen peptide A (FPA), a previously demonstrated

marker of myocardial infarction in serum (7) (Fig. 5, inset). The peptides corresponding to FPA are shown in the box and are enlarged in the inset. We were interested in estimating the reproducibility of MALDI peptide patterns. We show the results from six consecutive MALDI spots from six previously frozen aliquots of the same serum. We observed that extracted peptides spotted onto MALDI targets produced a reproducible pattern of ions, including larger peptides, such as the  fibrinogen fragments and FPA (Fig. 5). From this experiment, we found that the relative variation in the intensity of  fibrinogen peptides is not large but the absolute variation is significant.

Identification of C18 Peptides by Offline LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF
To better detect and identify lower-abundance components of MALDI-TOF spectra, we prepared serum by SPE with C18 and separated the components by offline LC onto metal plates prior to MALDI-TOF/TOF. The peptides were separated over a 30-min LC gradient from 5 to 65% acetonitrile at 2 µL/min onto metal plates and subsequently mixed with CHCA and examined by MALDITOF/TOF. Separation of the peptides by LC resulted in MALDI spots containing individual peptides and groups of chromatographically similar peptides (Fig. 6). Offline separation permitted identification of many peptides that were not prominent in the spectra of the batch C18 sample. The peptides LVKSQVNDNEEGFFSARGH at 2191 D, TDYDEGQDDRPKVGLGA at 1835 D, and TDYDEGQDDRP at 1310 Da were identified from the parent ion mass and fragmentation patterns produced by the TOF/TOF (not shown). A 1466-Da FPA was essentially purified onto a single MALDI target spot and subsequent MS/MS fragmentation resulted in a clear set of fragments corresponding to the FPA-like peptide TKESDFLAEGGGVR (Fig. 7A). Similarly,

A sample was broken into 100-µL aliquots and then frozen. Frozen aliquots were thawed, SPE with C18, and prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis. The position of an FPA cluster centered on 1218 m/z is shown by the black arrow and detailed view shown in the inset of the top panel.

a peptide at 1518 m/z showed MS/MS spectra correlating with the peptide SDPAGGEFLAEGGGVR (Fig. 7B); a peptide at 1207 m/z correlated to EGDFLAEGGGVR and another homolog of FPA DPPSGDFLTEGGGV at 1232 Da was also observed (not shown). We detected a phosphopeptide DPSGEGDFLAE GGGVR at 1546 m/z with a MOWSE score of 94 (Fig. 7C). The parent molecule, fibrinogen, is an abundant protein in serum and its presence has previously been confirmed by MS of serum digested with trypsin and separated by twodimensional-LC (21,24,25). In addition, the presence of angiotensin-like peptide II DRVYIHPF at 1046 Da, which differs from the common MS standard DRVYVHPFHL, was apparently very weakly detected with a MOWSE score of 43 (Fig. 7D). The different isoforms, posttranslational modifications of FPA we have detected here with automatic MS/MS identification by TANDEM or MASCOT or previously, are summarized in Table 2.

Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Tandem Mass Spectrometry
We tested extractions with C18 bound to paramagnetic beads in the 96-well format (17) or with more labor-intensive methods using commercial preparative microcolumns (ZipTips) and by batch collection over-magnetic and nonmagnetic C18 resin and found the results to be similar. The TIC profile for the C18 beads is shown in Fig. 8A. C18 resin seemed to efficiently capture FPA (Fig. 8B,C) with confident correlation scores by MASCOT or X-TANDEM using no enzyme searching parameters, consistent with previous results (3,7,17). We found that, for the identification of the fibrinogens and other serum proteins, C18 was a good choice and the combination of C18 with batch columns (SCX, WAX, SAX, HIC, and others), ultrafiltration, or organic solvent precipitation resulted in the identification of common serum proteins including fibrinogen - and -chain. In general,

poorer results were obtained with samples prepared with dye-binding or size-exclusion media (Table 3) and from ammonium sulfate supernatants. In agreement with others, we found that polypeptides may cofractionate with serum

albumin (18,26). MALDI ionization seemed to produce the best spectra from FPA isoforms containing the sequence FLAEGGGVR, similar to MALDI experiments with human serum. In LC-ESI ion-trap experiments the best MS/MS spectra were usually obtained from peptides containing the sequence FLTEGGGVR, in contrast to previously published human LC-ESIMS/MS data (7).

Correlation Analysis of Peptides
We used X-TANDEM (22) to correlate endogenous serum peptides to canonical blood proteins and proteins that are apparently not in high abundance in blood fluids (27). This algorithm is designed to detect peptides and modified peptides, but does not contemplate

the detection of peptides joined by cystine bridges. We present these correlations with log expectation values of ­2 or lower in Table 3, but we do not accept these results as unequivocal for the reasons outlined in the Discussion and previously (8). We found some peptides from known blood proteins, such as complement C3 and -2-HS-glycoprotein, albumin, serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, globulins, and other well-known blood proteins such as major histocompatibility complex molecules, clotting factor VIII, and plasminogen (Table 3). We also detected single peptides from many other blood proteins including immunoglobulins, C1Q, -2-macroglobulin, apolipoproteins, soluble receptors, disintegrins, fibronectins, thyroglobulin, ankyrins, proteoglycan, cadherin,

from five different isoforms from the collagen superfamily (Table 4) and we obtained one apparently significant peptide from the functionally and structurally related protein scavenger receptor B (Table 2). Few of these peptides were from the common high-abundance structural collagens I, II, and III, which would be expected if these peptides merely represented contamination from tissues. Rather, they were from the lower abundance collagens IV, V, VII, and XXVII that are associated with diverse regulatory functions on the cell surface or in the extracellular space (Table 3) (11). In addition, we observed peptides that could be weakly correlated to known antibody variable chains by MASCOT and with MOWSE scores more than 40 to peptides from many proteins that are not definitively known to exist in blood (not shown).

Discussion
We identified endogenous peptides from sera and have used MALDI MS/MS and LCMALDI MS/MS to identify families of fragments from albumin, serum amyloid A, apolipoprotein E and CIII, clusterin, complement C3 and 4a, and fibrinogen  (see Marshall et al. 2004 [8] and US Patents especially 20020161180, 20020161187, 20060024671, and many others originally filed in April 2001) and these results have recently been confirmed by two other groups (9,28). Similarly, we first showed that the mass spectra of serum peptides that differ between physiological states change with time and were the result of the ex vivo action of endo- and exopeptidases and that fresh plasma has fewer peptides than fresh serum (7) and these observations and hypothesis have been confirmed by other groups (9,28). However, our position is that this type of pattern analysis work is only for discovery experiments. Biomarkers discovered by MS and LC-MS should show differences by using standard analysis of variance of each peptide mass and followed by leave-one-out

cross validation (7). The peptides identified by MS/MS should be confirmed by a second method, such as immunology or the use of synthetic standards. In order to be useful in standard MS work flows, the peptides would have to be quantified by LC-ESI triple-stage quadrupole or with internally or externally standardized MS. All these important points remain to be given consideration, but, in a recent analysis of this field, it was suggested that the use of antibodies presenting on a surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization may provide greater specificity (29) as previously contemplated (30). The Human Proteome Organization concluded that plasma was the preferred blood sample (31) but has recently indicated there was no difference (32). Villanueva et al. (28) conclude that serum is preferable for peptide profiling. We have used serum for peptide profiling and protein discovery (7,8). However, the best sample for a specific purpose will likely be determined on a case-by-case basis, and both serum and plasma may be useful. In the present article, we turn our attention to the use of ESI that might be more amenable to quantitative analysis.

It may be possible to use endogenous lowabundance peptides of serum and plasma as biomarkers. At present, there is considerable debate as to whether the so-called peptidome even exists (33) and in what form (18). Peptides specifically cleaved from parent molecules that are designed to act as paracrine or endocrine signals are likely to be present briefly in small amounts. MS have detection limits in the attomol range for pure substances; but, in complex mixtures, only a small number of analytes attain useful ionization in any one instance (8). Fibrinogen peptides have a concentration in plasma in the nanomoles per liter or the femtomoles per microliter. Levels in serum should be greater. The robust limit for automatic MS/MS identification using our capillary LC-ESI-ion trap was about 20 fmol for a pure known peptide. A 100 pmol mixture of three digested standard proteins were very strongly detected and identified. We easily detected the fibrinogens at apparent concentrations of about 300 fmol per 1 µL of serum (~300 nM). We used 100 µL of starting serum for our extractions and identifications and therefore had sufficient material to

identify fibrinogens with expectation values as low as E-50 and other known blood proteins with values as high as E-2. It has been suggested that physiologically relevant molecules in blood may only exist at levels less than the detection limits of MS (34,35). However, because the binding constants (Kd) of physiologically relevant proteins can be in the micromolar-to-nanomolar range, it would appear that some biologically relevant molecules in the nano- to picomolar range might be discovered from small amounts of serum. Simple methods that have high yields and good resolving power are required to discover low abundance endogenous peptides. C18 chromatography worked well alone, or for collecting peptides previously fractionated by precipitation, filtration, or column chromatography. Thus, the optimization of preparative chromatographic materials, reagents and protocols for the extraction of peptides from biological blood fluids may prove to be a key step in advancing the identification of endogenous peptides and warrants much greater scrutiny than it has received to date (36). The large yield of peptides achieved by SPE permitted coupling of this method with other separation methods in serial combination, to explore more deeply the endogenous peptides of serum. C18 could be used to collect peptides from all other methods examined. We found that SPE with C18 provided the high yield and relative reproducibility required for discovery experiments. SPE with C18 resin worked in a variety of formats to extract and identify FPA. C18 microcolumns or 96-well plates with C18 magnetic beads could be used to rapidly prepare serum for identification of the potential biomarker FPA. C18 extraction occurs at low pH and this process will not only extract peptides that are freely dissolved in serum, but also those that may be noncovalently bound to high-mass proteins. Albumin has many cysteine residues, but we did not observe stronger signals or different peptides from serum treated with DTT. It has been

previously suggested that low-mass peptides may noncovalently bind to higher-molecular mass proteins, specifically BSA, and that these interactions could be disrupted by organic solvents used in ultrafiltration (20). We examined this concept using organic solvent and ammonium sulfate precipitation, dye affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and ultrafiltration. We used precipitation with acetonitrile and observed that a pool of polypeptides did not coprecipitate with the large-molecular mass proteins. The inclusion of albumin isolation prior to C18 extraction resulted in sample loss and reduced the number of peptides identified by LC-MS/MS. In agreement with previous results, we found that ultrafiltration could be used to detect peptides from blood (20). We concluded that not all peptides remain strongly bound to albumin at all times. However, peptides may potentially be bound to albumin or other lipoprotein complexes (14,36,37). The intense MALDI spectral elements from unfractionated serum or plasma represent peptides from abundant circulating proteins of the blood (7,9). Biomarker peptide patterns have been discerned from unfractionated serum or plasma for many diseases or physiological states using TOF-MS, but these techniques can also discern the differences in sample collection procedures used by sites or individuals (6). We have previously proposed that the differences observed in MALDI spectra between physiological and disease states could reflect the activity of disease-specific proteases or enzymes released or activated in the blood that act on blood proteins (7). Although it seems possible that blood peptides might one day be used for robust diagnosis via MS, it is highly unlikely that this will be achieved without prefractionation, followed by targeted assays to quantify the peptides (6,33). It is possible that some of the peptides in plasma or serum may have been generated in vivo. However, previous time-course and inhibitor studies show that MALDI patterns of abundant serum

Endogenous Peptides From Serum _____________________________________________________________ 85

peptides change rapidly after blood collection to reach ex vivo steady states that represent the balance between the generation of peptides by protease activity and the degradation of peptides by amino and carboxy peptidases (7). Recently, an independent group repeated our original experiments (7) in which blood fluids were incubated ex vivo and they came to the same conclusion that blood peptide levels reflect the balance of endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities and that this principle might be used to detect disease specific peptidase activities (28). However, we argue that standard analytical identification, quantification, and statistical analysis should be used along with synthetic chromatography standards and immunological confirmation (7). The use of SPE together with other preparation schemes, followed by LC-MS/MS, revealed multiple isoforms of FPA bearing different amino acid substitutions detectable by LCMALDI-MS/MS. For myocardial infarction, the disease mechanism has been linked to the generation of common serum peptides, such as FPA and C3f, and confirmed by immunological methods (7). In the present study, we were able to identify numerous amino acid substitutions, and even posttranslational modification of the FPA peptide. This may indicate that, when combined with LC-separation, these techniques will permit the acquisition of information about specific peptide isoforms and modifications from biological samples. Developing sample preparation methods for assigning identity to low-molecular mass peptides is of central importance. These methods will help to transform mass spectra-based diagnosis from a relative technique of comparing unknown peak patterns (5) to a more robust method of quantifying known peptides. The concept of a "peptidome" (38) brings up several additional considerations for the standard of proof associated with protein identifications (39). Serum is known to contain a variety of proteolytic enzymes including endo- and

exopeptidases. Serum contains tryptic, chymotryptic, metalloproteinase, and other proteolytic activities. Because of the effect of constitutive amino- and carboxyl-exopeptidase activity (7), and perhaps the apparent presence of multiple proteases in sera (24), searches need to be performed with no enzyme specified. Previous studies have used MS analysis of serum and, apparently, fit the parent mass values to the predicted cleavage products of the major blood proteins in which a minority of peptides were positively identified by MS/MS. In practical experience, it is actually quite challenging to get unbiased and automatic identification of endogenous blood peptides by MS/MS compared to tryptic digests. In this article, we only present unbiased automatic MS/MS identifications with no inference of additional peptides by parent mass. Peptides such as angiotensin are single discrete polypeptide messengers that circulate in the blood and act as hormones or regulatory agents. In contrast to intentional tryptic digests, where there is a high probability of finding multiple peptides from the same digested protein, there is no guarantee of finding multiple peptides from the same protein in the endogenous peptides of serum. Confident identification of single peptides of low abundance is well known to be problematic and this difficulty is further compounded by the weak and complex signals associated with the endogenous peptides of serum. The confidence in single peptides would likely be somewhat increased by replicate identification in time (for example, Cancer Susceptibility was detected in multiple samples see Candidate 3, was detected in multiple samples, see Table 2) but this is likely not sufficient evidence because the same misidentification may be reproducible. Common immunological methods for proteins such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot may be difficult to apply to small peptides. Single antibody methods, such as dot blots or affinity purification prior to MA, may provide the necessary confirmation (2).

Because there are only about 22,000 proteins in RefSeq, but there may be approx 1 billion variable chains associated with immunoglobulins that, as a class, are a highly abundant component of serum, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that peptides from variable chains could confound mass spectral identifications in the absence of highly accurate mass measurements. Detection and identification of blood peptides may be confounded by biochemical modifications. It remains possible that some peptides were difficult to analyse or shifted in parent mass by posttranslational modifications in addition to C- and N-terminal exopeptidase action that may remove basic charges and add acidic charges, such as phosphate of sulfate, that may effect ionization. It is known that removing phosphorylations may increase the ionization and detection of peptides (40). The fibrinopeptides, for example, are well known to be modified by both phosphorylation and sulfation (41­45) and this may have partially inhibited their detection. It has been suggested that sulfonation may be useful under some circumstances (46). Questionable identifications of low-abundance peptides could be confirmed by similar chromatographic characteristics and fragmentation of synthetic peptides, but this approach is not useful for high-throughput discovery. A better solution could be the use of highresolution MS, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance. For peptidomics, highly accurate parent masses combined with MS/MS analysis may also be required to provide highly confident predictions (47,48). If the endogenous peptide is indeed a powerful regulatory molecule, then it may be possible to detect its effects by classical bioassays. A practical means of building confidence in putative identifications may be comparison of endogenous peptides identified with lists of proteins identified from tryptic digestion of serum. For example, the rab/rac binding protein piccolo

does not seem to be a blood protein, but similar proteins have been observed in blood (26,49). Other proteins that also seem to make little intuitive sense, such as the Nedd 4 binding protein, actually show significant homology to tumor necrosis factor-, which is known to circulate remain unconfirmed. A library of known endogenous peptide analytes might be created using LC-MS/MS and related to the changes in the intensity of a particular parent ion in spectra from normal and disease samples (16). In this article, we show that with optimal sample preparation, the peptides of biological fluids could be identified by LC-MS/MS using ESI and MALDI ionization. Bovine fetal serum is a rich source of growth factors. From this fluid, we correlated several peptides to isoforms of the collagen superfamily, a group known to be processed proteolytically to release powerful regulatory molecules (11). The ongoing gains in sensitivity of MS indicate that the number of endogenous peptides identified by MS/MS from biological fluids will likely increase in the future. To be useful, the peptides must be unambiguously identified by massaccurate MS and MS/MS and quantified by triple-quadrupole MS. Their practical applicability in diagnostics remains an open question.
