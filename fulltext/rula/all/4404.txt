the impact of window-to-wall ratio on energy intensity of existing office buildings in ontario and quebec Master of Science 2015 Viktoriya Mykytyak Building Science Ryerson University

Abstract
Energy codes, such as SB-10, provide significant impact on the thermal performance of the building envelope. For design of new buildings, a window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of 40% is considered as a threshold in Ontario for using prescriptive solutions for thermal resistance of the enclosure. This study will demonstrate the relationship of the energy intensity of the existing office building to the WWR, through analysis of 15 office buildings located in Ontario and Quebec. Recent studies indicate that building geometry can influence the energy efficiency of the building; nevertheless, factors that impact energy intensity of existing buildings are not researched in full, and this study's aim is to minimize the knowledge gap in this field of literature. The outcome of this research shows that WWR directly influences energy intensity of the building. Energy balance calculations and energy loads distribution showed that WWR impacts on average 15% of overall energy consumption.

Introduction
The inspiration for this study came due to of the importance of window-to-wall ratio (WWR) that is being given during the design of new buildings. Several studies have been done for various types of buildings with a view, to quantify the impact of WWR and envelope characteristics on the total energy consumption of the building. These studies have shown that there is a significant impact on the total energy consumption because of the WWR. For instance, Dogrusoy & Tureyen (2007) and Ross (2009) in their studies showed that WWR, has slightly overpowering results on energy use in commercial buildings than other building geometry parameters. In addition, Ferdous (2012) research outlines that WWR influences the energy intensity of existing office buildings. The current OBC requirements put a threshold of WWR of 40% up to which the thermal characteristics of the building envelope may be chosen based on prescriptive requirements. The manner in which this 40% is established is not very well understood. All the studies that have been examined were carried out on buildings using energy modeling and typical shapes. There is hardly any information on the energy consumption in existing buildings and its relationship to the WWR. Furthermore the shapes assumed in many of these studies are much different from the architectural form that some of the existing buildings take. This study explores the possibility of using actual energy consumption data along with actual architectural forms and building envelope characteristics to examine the type of relationship that exists between the WWR and the energy consumption. This study also explores the potential for changes in envelope characteristics to contribute to reduction in energy consumption of the existing buildings. Additionally, the findings of this study that are reported here, will discuss the weight of potential benefits of WWR calculations when assessing energy consumption, by evaluating guidelines of Level 1 energy audits.

Literature review
Energy conservation and sustainability are subjects of great interest in today's society; this applies especially to the commercial and institutional sector due to very high and growing demand for energy. According to National Resources Canada (2008), commercial and institutional (C&I) establishments accounts for two third of the housing sector. Survey specifies that 36% of commercial and institutional establishments are located in Ontario, 22% in Quebec, 18% in the Prairies, 16% in BC and 8% in Atlantic Canada. In addition, Ontario accounts for the highest amount energy consumption, approximately 30% each; Quebec stands third with 23% of overall energy consumption. Therefore C&I sector in Ontario and Quebec requires close attention in terms of energy efficiency. Typically, efforts to reduce energy consumption in the C&I sector are put towards research and development of energy efficient building technologies such as equipment, heating and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and ventilation systems. It is not very common to proceed with passive technologies such as WWR ratio to achieve energy efficiency in the existing building. Despite common strategies, WWR solution has been promoted on a large scale through different mechanisms, including building codes and incentives. Supplementary standards SB-10 to the Building Code address WWR specifications and compliances to how it should be implemented. For design of new buildings a WWR of 40% is considered as a threshold in Ontario allowing for the use of prescriptive solutions for thermal resistance of the enclosure. Following literature review was completed to identify factors that relate to the WWR and its impact on energy use/energy loads. Also to review how or whether WWR gets taken into account in energy audits of existing buildings. And to set a benchmark values for energy intensity, literature review was summarized to get an idea about the energy performance of existing buildings.

1.1

Building Energy Intensity

Canada's commercial and institutional establishments, cold climate and vast geography all contribute to it being a highly energy-intensive country (The Conference Board of Canada, 2013). Energy intensity is a total primary energy supply per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) (The Conference Board of 3

1.1 Building Energy Intensity Canada, 2013). Currently Canada ranks last for energy intensity in comparison to 17 peer countries (some of the countries are Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, U.K. and others). In 2009, Canadian primary energy supply was 0.25 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) per US$1,000 GDP, in comparison to the peer country average of 0.15 (toe). The positive aspect of this is that Canada has reduced its energy intensity by 39% since 1971 (The Conference Board of Canada, 2013), and slowly reducing even more; therefore, increased awareness of energy conservation and sustainability are beneficial on the large scale. The Conference Board of Canada (2013) defines energy intensity in GDP, but in this report, calculations of energy consumption will be expressed in gigajoules [GJ], floor area will be expressed in square meters [m2 ], and energy intensity will be expressed in gigajoules per square meter [GJ/m2 ], as per Natural Resources Canada's Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE). In addition energy intensity can be adjusted for the energy consumed in producing electricity (for fuel choices such as natural gas, oil, coal, biomass or fuel wood); energy intensity is defined as total energy consumed, divided by total floor area, for the reference year (National Resources Canada, 2008). Every year, Natural Resources Canada's Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) estimates Canada's energy consumption by economic sector; these studies collected energy data, and estimated energy consumption in the C&I sector. Commercial and Institutional Building Energy Use Survey (CIBEUS) is a detailed study that was conducted on behalf of the Office of Energy Efficiency of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). This is the first survey of its kind conducted to provide detailed information on the commercial sector. This survey gathered data on energy consumption, energy intensity and the physical and energy efficient characteristics of commercial and institutional buildings located in Canada. Survey was completed in 2000, and all the data was analyzed, summarized and published in 2002. Report (OEE, 2002) was based on data in major Canadian cities, and concluded that in year 2000, the overall energy intensity was 1.59 GJ/m2 . In 2003 the first Consumption of Energy Survey (CES) was completed. This report focused exclusively on Canada's universities, colleges and hospitals. This survey covered all ten provinces, and showed results as energy intensity for universities to be 2.04 GJ/m2 , for colleges to be 1.48 GJ/m2 and for hospitals to be 2.65 GJ/m2 (OEE, 2003). A year later in 2004 another survey was performed to cover much broader C&I sector, and energy intensity results in this survey were estimated as 1.6 GJ/m2 (OEE, 2004). Later in 2006 Statistics Canada conducted Commercial and Institutional Consumption of Energy Survey (CICES) for Natural Resources Canada, collecting 2005 data. For business and institutions, energy intensity was estimated as 1.54 GJ/m2 (OEE, 2005). This report gathered data on the age of establishment, also on energy sources used for space heating, space cooling and water heating. (OEE, 2005) report contains in-depth analysis of each of these variables. In 2011 similar survey estimated that in 2008 Canadian C&I sector comprised of almost 470,000 establishments occupying 705 million square meters of floor area. (OEE, 2011) also estimated energy intensity for Canadian C&I sector as 1.23 GJ/m2 , in addition, the report provides values for Ontario only as 1.02 GJ/m2 in comparison to higher values in Quebec and Prairie. The most recent survey report that is available to the public was published in 2013 based on survey data in 2009. Report claims that in 2009 there were 482,000 C&I buildings; it is 12,000 more than just a year ago, and these establishments are occupying about 766 million m2 of floor space (OEE, 2013). Report estimates that in 2009 the overall energy intensity of C&I buildings in Canada was 1.10 GJ/m2 , this value is lower than in previous study, and considerably lower 4

1.1 Building Energy Intensity than in all previous surveys. 27% of all C&I buildings in Canada were at least 50 years old, but buildings built in the 1970s had the highest proportions of both floor space and energy use. Report claims that Survey of Commercial and Institutional Energy Use (SCIEU) 2009 estimated that 46% of the C&I buildings were renovated between 2005 and 2009. The most common type of building renovations was lighting, and it's around 26%. Only 4.6% of C&I buildings underwent additions or reductions, and 23% underwent windows and insulation refurbishment (OEE, 2013). To review the fluctuating energy intensity value, an evaluation of all survey results prepared by OEE and Natural Resources Canada was done. The summary of data from reports was compiled in Figure 1.1 to determine if the fluctuations in energy intensity value over the years were decreasing or increasing. Specifically, the last survey performed in 2009 reports claims a considerable decrease in energy intensity value in C&I Canadian sector. In addition, every year, the Office of Energy Efficiency publishes the Energy Use Data Handbook that provides a statistical overview of Canada's sectorial energy use as well as GHG emissions. This handbook (Natural Resources Canada Handbook, 2014) summarizes and compares energy intensity data estimated in every survey. Among the other sectors, this handbook provides data on energy consumption of C&I sector per year starting from 1990 (Fig. 1.1). Energy intensity in 1990 was estimated as 1.68 GJ/m2 , and the most recent value of energy intensity is provided for 2012 equals to 1.43 GJ/m2 . Handbook tables demonstrate 14.9% decrease in energy consumption from 1990, and almost 19% decrease from 2000, 2002 and 2003.

dition to previous literature, BOMA BEST Energy and Environment Report (BBEER) were reviewed. BBEER is Canada's leading assessment and certification program that provides benchmark data and performance success case studies. 3,562 buildings have achieved BOMA BESt certification and/or recertification across Canada since 2005 (BOMA, 2014). Report shows that average energy use intensity for certified Office Buildings is 27.1 ekWh/ft2 /yr (or 1.05GJ/m2 /year). Based on percentages of energy consumption by Ontario and Quebec, as well as percentages of institutional and commercial buildings located in these two provinces, this information was combined with Natural Resources of Canada Handbook data for 2012; the following can be summarized. In Canada, total C&I energy use for 2012 was equal to 1069.2 (PJ) with the following breakdown for energy use by energy source (Figure 1.2), energy use by end-use (Figure 1.3) and energy use by activity type (Figure 1.4), with total energy intensity of 1.43 (GJ/m2 /year) based on total floor space 741 (million m2 ). Summary: from the above data, it can be concluded that Canadian offices account for 34.9% of overall energy consumption, with total floor area of 305.15 (million m2 ), and energy intensity of 1.22 (GJ/m2 /year). Approximately 22% of these offices are located in Ontario and 18% in Quebec. It was noticed that Quebec accounts for 23% of total energy consumption, and Ontario, not too much higher, is accounted for 30%. Based on total C&I energy of 1,069.2 (PJ) Quebec infrastructure and commercial sector consumes significantly less energy of 44.26 (PJ) than Ontario 70.56 (PJ). Energy intensity is directly dependent on the total floor area of the building, and building envelope characteristics do not influence these calculations. Buildings total energy consumption indicators, based on building orientation, size and facade components, can provide a breakdown on how does actual energy data relates 6

1.2 Role of WWR in Building Energy Consumption to building envelope characteristics.

1.2

Role of WWR in Building Energy Consumption

In order to analyze the relationship between WWR and the energy intensity of the building, a number of papers were reviewed with regards to factors influencing the building's energy intensity. (Harvey, 2013) in his research identifies essential principles of low-energy design, and lists important steps in the design of low-energy buildings, these are: building orientation (this includes also surface area-to-volume ratio and thermal mass), high performance building envelope, passive systems (heating, cooling, ventilation and daylighting), individual energy devises (to ensure that energy devises can be controlled individually based on necessity of users), and proper commissioning of the building. Also (Harvey, 2013) distinguishes between energy loads and energy use. The term load refers to the amount of heat that has to be added or removed from the building to maintain the desired indoor temperature. Energy loads directly depend on the following factors: climate, the form and orientation of the building, external shading, characteristics of the building envelope (including insulation, fenestration properties, WWR and air tightness) and desired indoor comfort (temperatures during the heating and cooling seasons). Additional factors are also internal heat from equipment, lighting and human occupancy. (Harvey, 2013) explains that energy uses are given by the heating and cooling load divided by the efficiency of the building's systems and equipment. Therefore the main difference between energy loads and energy use is that energy loads are established at the design stage and can be predicted by simulation and estimations, but energy uses are variable unit and directly depends on current efficiency of the building, which can only be determined by analyzing energy bills. To summarize: modifying the building's design or influencing energy uses (stirring them towards energy efficiency) is the only way to minimize energy loads. Summary: upon review of the (Harvey, 2013) research, it can be concluded that WWR is inversely directed to low-energy building designs, as well as energy consumption of these buildings. WWR has an important role to play in reducing energy intensity of the commercial building sector, and help to maximize the return on investment in energy-efficient technologies. Building energy intensity can be minimized by bringing into focus, the percentages of efficient building envelope window to wall; thus generating savings that could partly balance additional costs for pricey high-efficiency equipment and high-performance envelope. Harvey (2013) in his report provides that the average total energy use in commercial buildings in the United States and Canada is 266 kWh/m2 /year (or 0.97 GJ/m2 /yeah), whereas the average energy use of the same if complying with the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standard would be 157 kWh/m2 /year (or 0.57 GJ/m2 /year), this could provide savings of 41%.

WWR Role in Typical Energy Audits

Mainly energy audits are conducted to analyze the energy consumption of the building and to make a preliminary list of energy efficiency measures. Typically, the report produces following actions: reduce wastage at the source, use of high-efficiency products, optimize use of facilities to ensure best possible 8

1.3 WWR Role in Typical Energy Audits comfort for occupants and of course minimize energy consumption. Energy audits very rarely include any discussion on building envelope assemblies; they don't analyze current thermal resistance of building envelope and only propose immediate actions to building envelope if significant damage is evident.

Energy auditing of a building can range from a short walk-through of the facility to a detailed analysis with computer simulations. (Krarti, 2010) in his book presents simplified analysis methods to evaluate energy conservation opportunities in commercial buildings, and these methods are based on wellestablished engineering methods. Book is also used as reference for practitioners as well as textbook for students. Generally, four types of energy audits can be distinguished: walk-through audit (during which immediate and inexpensive actions can be concluded), utility cost analysis (detailed analysis of energy bills are performed to identify the patterns of energy use, peak demand, weather effects and potential energy savings; this audit should be performed in combination with walk-through audit), standard energy audit (during which comprehensive energy analysis of the energy systems are conducted; in addition to walk-through audit and utility cost analysis, the standard energy audit includes the development of a baseline for the building's energy use, energy savings and cost-effective measures), and detailed energy audit (subsequently, during this audit, instruments are used to measure energy; to evaluate possible energy retrofits for the building, computer simulations are used). Energy modeling is performed during the standard energy audit; these include: baseline energy modeling, degree-day methods and linear regression models, as well as payback analysis.

To evaluate if building envelope characteristics are analyzed during energy audit and to what extent building envelope retrofits are considered, general procedure of detailed energy audit was reviewed in more details. Building envelope is considered as one of energy conservation measures (ECMs), and is recommended to be evaluated during walk-through survey, wherein the auditor should determine the actual characteristics of the building envelope, and all necessary repairs. (Krarti, 2010) specifies that energy audit of the envelope is especially important for residential buildings, and it's believed that for commercial and institutional buildings improvements to the building envelope are often not cost-effective due to the fact that modifications to the building envelope are often too expensive. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to perform audit for envelope components systematically not only to determine the potential for energy savings but also to ensure the integrity of its overall condition. Main concerns are always thermal bridging and moisture condensation, and no concerns in regards to WWR are mentioned during energy conservation measures (ECMs).

Summary: it can be concluded that although building envelope is an important item during energy audit, it is very rarely considered during an actual audit of the existing building. Because WWR is typically part of building envelope evaluation, therefore WWR is not considered during energy audit either. 9

Establishing Effective WWR Based on Energy Efficiency
Fenestration Systems and Daylighting

In the building concept, fenestration systems are typically the main source of sunlight, therefore directly related to daylighting potentials of the building. ASHRAE defines fenestration systems as assemblies and components of windows and openings located on building envelope (ASHRAE Handbook Fundamentals, 2005). While fenestration can be extremely beneficial by providing daylight access, natural ventilation and visual communication between the interior and exterior, if glazed areas are not properly designed it can negatively impact energy consumption of the building. The following three papers were reviewed to outline significance of fenestration systems and its impact on building's energy efficiency. First literature (ASHRAE Handbook Fundamentals, 2012) is a manual that provides current engineering procedures and practices, and it was reviewed to summarize key points of daylighting. (Ko, 2009) is a dissertation paper that provides research on fenestration and daylighting, and summarizes this information into guidelines; this paper was reviewed to conclude if energy conservation through daylight can overpower energy loss due to lowering thermal resistance of the building envelope. (Public Works and Government Services Canada, 2002)'s report is a daylighting guide for Canadian commercial buildings and it provides a 10-step guide for daylighting design process; this guideline was reviewed for fenestration design concept and WWR calculations. Fenestration system in the building is typically a component with the lower thermal resistance, therefore fenestration properties such as configuration of fenestration openings, window area, U-factor solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and visible transmittance (VT) have to be considered to achieve energy efficient buildings. According to Ko (2009), the size of the fenestration plays an important role in saving energy. ASHRAE Handbook explains key points of daylighting, these points are: daylighting is the illumination of a building's interiors by sunlight; daylight affects visual performance, lighting capacity, health, human performance and energy efficiency; daylight can provide significant energy conservation of the building and reduce electric lighting if utilized properly (ASHRAE Handbook Fundamentals, 2005). Though daylight provides above-mentioned benefits, on the other hand, it could create an issue in the energy efficient design parameters related to energy conservation due to lowering thermal performance of the building envelope. If fenestration area is oversized, this can directly contribute to increasing the building's energy consumption. Therefore proper fenestration design should be integrated with other building parameters to achieve energy efficient building. In the report prepared by Public works and Government Services Canada (2002) the same conclusion is made that daylight can adversely impact thermal resistance of the building due to bigger window sizes, resulting in higher energy consumption. The report provides a 10-step daylighting design process; selecting optimal window placement, room size, window area and space configuration can provide adequate and uniform daylight for rooms around the building perimeter. The report also provides an equation for WWR calculations, where the net glazing area (windows area minus mullions and framing) is divided by gross exterior wall area (width of the bay by floor-to-floor height). In addition, the report provides 10

1.4 Establishing Effective WWR Based on Energy Efficiency alternative procedures on how required WWR can be calculated for a standard room with specific properties. Calculations provide typical WWR value as 0.3 (fraction), from where required net glazing area can be calculated by multiplying the WWR by the wall area. Summary: daylight can significantly reduce energy consumption utilized for artificial indoor lighting; based on a number of researches, energy savings of 15% to 45% can be achieved by a daylighting scheme, depending on shape and climate zone of the building (Ko, 2009). Although daylighting benefits can be significant, oversizing fenestration area can negatively impact thermal resistance of the building envelope as well as contribute to overheating and glare. Therefore two main components: fenestration design and WWR will be reviewed further.

1.4.2

Fenestration Thermal Efficiency

One can easily assume that the disadvantage of beneficial daylighting is a lower thermal resistance of a building, solution being to increase thermal resistance of the fenestration part of the building envelope. Consequently, a fenestration part of building envelope can be over-insulated to accommodate lost thermal efficiency; the high costs of these, however, may result in them not being very feasible. To examine the relationship between windows and building energy consumption, and explore existing opportunities for improving energy use in existing buildings, additional literature was reviewed. In Tzempelikos (2005) report, benefits of advanced glazing products are discussed. Recently these products have replaced traditional double-glazed windows and have low-emissivity glazing (low-e) that includes a special coating on one of the surfaces, this coating dramatically reduces the longwave radiation and minimizes heat losses (Tzempelikos, 2005). The report explains how various types of advanced glazing allow the dynamic use of building envelope, and how they help to maintain interior thermal needs, and at the same time respond to outdoor climate. In addition, author sufficiently reviews different types of advanced glazing such as electrochromic, thermochromic, translucent, photochromic and gasochromic glazing. Through analysis of different research literature, the Tzempelikos claims that by selecting proper fenestration, annual energy consumption can be reduced drastically (from 11% to 18%) in comparison to conventional double-glazed windows. The report provides detailed guidelines for selecting WWR, as well as recommendations for choosing shading device properties and control in conjunction with electric lighting operation. Guidelines include option from selecting WWR from theoretical graph, or by calculations through formulas. With supporting calculations, the author demonstrates that daylight availability ratio and thermal loads always increase as WWR increases for all orientations. WWR is directly influencing energy demand of the building; nevertheless energy demand for both heating and cooling can be considerably reduced if windows would have higher thermal resistance (Tzempelikos, 2005). Summary: by improving building envelope characteristic, energy use of existing building can be also improved, therefore WWR is a very important factor that impacts energy use compared to other components of building envelope, due to its very low thermal resistance. 11

1.4 Establishing Effective WWR Based on Energy Efficiency

1.4.3

Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR)

Further literature was reviewed to investigate to what extent WWR impacts energy consumption compared to other parameters such as building orientation and shading; and what is preferred occupants' optimal size of the windows. In (Dogrusoy & Tureyen, 2007) field study, occupants' visual satisfaction was achieved when window area occupies 44 - 100% of the wall area. Occupants in the (Ludlow, 1976) study preferred the window area of 50-80% for visual satisfaction, which was significantly lower than that of the (Dogrusoy & Tureyen, 2007). This percentage is higher, and could be due to study being completed much earlier than Dogrusoy & Tureyen field study. Occupants are more aware the importance of thermal efficiency. Another study which took place in Canadian office concluded by (Boubekri, Hull, & Boyer, 1991) found that the optimal size of the window was between 15% and 25% of the total wall area, and 40% was found to be a maximum acceptable limit. This study was based on relaxation study, and study suggests that sunlight penetration can promote relaxed feelings and overall satisfaction. Thesis research completed by (Ross, 2009) demonstrates the impact of architects on environmental loads imposed by building through building form, orientation and enclosure design, including WWR design. The report summarises best practice design approaches, and highlights that facade design strategy with WWR between 20% and 40% are most functional. Through simulations and calculations, research also suggests list of operations that lead to lower energy intensity of the building; research emphasizes that by modifying WWR within the previously mentioned percentage range, would lead to more energy efficiency. WWR has stronger impact on the energy intensity than building form, orientation, window orientation and shading (Ross, 2009). In addition, the more WWR was reduced, the bigger affect it had on energy intensity of the building, and therefore energy intensity was lowered. The report identifies that 5% reduction in energy-use-intensity occurred with each 20% decrease in the WWR. (Ferdous, 2012) in her report investigated the potential of building geometry to minimize energy consumption in office buildings. Five different geometries were modeled as commercial occupancies in the context of Toronto, Ontario, and examined with various design parameters: WWR and external static shading devices. The modeling was performed with WWR of 30%, 50%, 70% and 80% for all five building geometries; total height, floor to ceiling height for each floor and gross floor area were kept the same of all buildings. To investigate driving force affecting the thermal conditions of a building climate analysis were performed, as well as space heating, cooling and interior lighting energy loads. Results showed that the consumption for space heating almost doubled for each plan type (with inclusion of the shading devices) when WWR was increased from 30% to 80%. The consumption for space cooling energy had also gradually increased when WWR increases (with no shading), but only varied a little when the shading was in place. Lighting energy was significantly impacted by WWR, as the WWR increased the energy demand for lighting reduced. To summarize the research, author claims that as WWR increased gradually from 30% to 80%, the total annual energy consumption for every modeled archetype also increased, and effect was more significant than the building shape (Ferdous, 2012). Below are results summary charts to represent the impact of WWR on energy intensity from Ferdous' report. The increase in total energy use ranged from 10.9% to 16.3% as WWR increased. 12

1.4 Establishing Effective WWR Based on Energy Efficiency When WWR increased from 30% to 80%, results for individual energy factors in Ferdous' report are following (for Square shape building, no shading): heating energy increased by 45.9% (from 222 MWh to 410 MWh); cooling energy increased by 18.14% (from 76.62 MWh to 93.6 MWh), however cooling energy was found to be dependent on interior lighting energy. From above WWR has significant impact on occupants' visual and mood satisfaction, but even more significant, it had an effect on total energy demand of the building. However papers above conducted on site or simulation studies to calculate required WWR; there are already established standards that provide acceptable WWR percentage. In Europe, energy performance standards for buildings are guided by the European Commission's Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. In US, each state develops their individual building codes, and many directives vary by state. As an example, in California, the California Energy Commission (which sets building standards) and the California Public Utility Commission (which regulates utilities) are both pursuing decrease of energy intensity. However, each state has different standards; there are two bodies providing a baseline for building energy codes, these are: International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air conditioning Engineers, (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1 Energy Standard for Buildings except Low Rise Buildings (Ryan, 2012). In Canada, codes and standards for energy efficiency and window-to-wall specifications are Supplementary Standard SB-10 to the Building Code (energy efficiency for housing). In addition ASHRAE standards also act as a baseline for energy efficiency in Canada. Specific standards recommendations concerning the fenestration of the facade also differ from country to country (Motuziene & Juodis, 2010). For instance, ASHRAE (2004) recommends WWR to be from 20% to 40%; some of the European countries such as Norwegian standards for building energy performance NS 3031:2007 recommends that the glazing area must not exceed 20% of the heated wall area; however in Canada the recommended fenestration area is calculated due to the dimensions of the room, and the calculations usually give WWR a value close to 30% (PWC, 2002). SB-10 under its prescriptive requirements, states for minimum performance requirements in the code, specifies that for non-residential occupancy buildings, the gross area of fenestration to the gross area of peripheral wall measured from grade to the top of the most upper ceiling shall be less than 40%. If the glazed area exceeds prescriptive requirements, this area shall comply with additional (higher R-value) prescriptive approach. As it has been discussed previously in this report in fenestration systems and daylighting section, a glazed area is directly related to both heating and cooling loads in the buildings. Thermal performance of glazing units significantly contribute to heat loss through the building envelope, therefore impact heating loads and overall energy demand of the building. In addition, a glazed area can cause unwanted heat gains that contribute to increased cooling loads. SB-10 also specifies maximum solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), to oversee unmanaged heat gains. The main objectives for introducing limit percentage for W in SB-10 prescriptive requirements are to minimize heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer. Summary: based on literature review above, WWR plays an important role for occupant's satisfaction and energy efficiency of the building. WWR is summarized in the Table 1.1 below. 13

Literature Review Summary

From the above reviewed information it can be concluded that for most part WWR is not taken into account in audits of existing buildings perhaps because this has not been addressed previously. But, by looking at the collected information, it is evident that WWR has impact on energy use and energy load of the building. Therefore, by introducing parameters of WWR analysis into energy audits could at least alert owners about the possibilities of envelope improvements. BOMA average energy value of 1.05GJ/m2 /year will be used as benchmark guide value in case-study building analysis. As well as, WWR of 40% will be used as maximum value of existing buildings analysis, as per Ontario prescriptive solutions for thermal resistance of the enclosure.

Scope and Approach
The approach of this study is to determine and quantify to what extent WWR influences energy usage of office buildings selected for this research. This will be achieved by reviewing and evaluating utility bills and calculations of energy consumption of each building; data was provided by SNC Lavalin, Operational and Maintenance department. For this study to be successful it was required to draw upon the energy consumption data for existing buildings. Pursuing the inspiration of this idea through the workplace it was determined that energy data of existing commercial buildings could be obtained. Initial exploration of this data determined that it was complete in terms of energy usage by fuel type and month for several years of occupancy. The availability of this data encouraged further pursuit of this topic. Research will analyze actual energy data of existing buildings, and conclusions will be made on how this data relates to a building envelope characteristics. Thorough calculations and analysis research will evaluate the significance of WWR in comparison to other energy consumption indicators such as number of stories, building orientation and window and opaque thermal performance based on heating and cooling loads.

Fifteen office buildings were selected for this study, eleven of case-study buildings are located in Ontario and four located in Quebec province of Canada. These fifteen buildings were selected because they represent typical buildings within a portfolio of office buildings managed by SNC Lavalin. All case-study buildings are different in shape, height and age. Buildings were categorized in the following manner: Category 1 Shape: Case-study buildings were divided into four different categories shown in the Figure 3.2. Photo of each building's shape was taken from Google Earth web source. As shown above most of the buildings have a complex irregular shape, however when buildings were selected they represented 18

3.1 Description of Buildings typical office buildings in Ontario/Quebec provinces. Table 3.1 summarizes repetition of each shape category. Shape names were chosen in the following manner: if building footprint has very distinctive square or rectangular shape they would be called accordingly; but if building footprint has more than four distinguishable corners they would fall under complex category; however to make it simpler, they still would be related to the square or rectangular shape.

Table 3.1: Buildings' Shape Summary Shape Square Rectangular Complex - Square Complex - Rectangular Quantity 3 4 2 6

Three of the square buildings that are located in Ottawa have very similar shape and are located at the same office site, but the height of each building varies. Four rectangular buildings also vary in height, two of them are 2 floors only, one is 4 floors in height and fourth building is a high rise. Most of the complex shape buildings also have complex flooring height, meaning they have an irregular number of floors in different parts of the building. It was noted that although case-study building were chosen for being typical office structures, but more than half of them have a complex and a nonstandard shape of the footprint. Only 3 buildings have a square shape, and 4 rectangular; the rest have non-typical complex shapes. In (Ferdous, 2012), the report author analyzes five distinguishing types of building shapes: square, rectangular horizontal, rectangular vertical, cross and h-type. Based on casestudy buildings selected for this study, only seven building can fall under these categories of geometric descriptions, and the rest would require more complex simulations. Category 2 Height: Fifteen case-study buildings were divided into three categories based on their height, the Figure 3.3 shows all buildings and the above number represents how many floors each building has. Buildings were grouped into three categories with regards to height: low-rise buildings from 1 to 3 floors, mid-rise from 4 to 5 floors, and high-rise from 6 and up. 15 buildings spread out; five evenly in each category. Category 3 Age: Most of the buildings were constructed between 1975 and 1990; only one building was constructed in 1873 and one was constructed after 1990, in 1993. None of the buildings is under Ontario or Quebec Heritage Properties act. Figure 3.4 shows all 15 building based on the year of construction. 19

This could be attributed to the fact that some of the tenants pay for electricity independently, which is not captured by energy bills. Therefore 25% will be added to energy index value to approximate missing data. The HVAC is provided by 40 roof top units. The RTUs are electric cooling and natural gas heating and many are still original equipment since 1988. Building also has Building Automation System (BAS) and controls scheduling of equipment. Energy audit for this building suggests completing refurbishment for a roof as signs of deterioration are showing; however this was not done yet. Building #6 is located at Scarborough, Ontario. Overview: the building is a combination of office space and retail space, with 2,130 m2 of gross floor area. The building was constructed in 1980. Already two first level energy audits were performed for this building, but no upgrades were completed yet. Typical building operating hours are from Monday to Friday from 6am to 7pm, on Saturdays from 7am to 6pm, and on Sundays the building is closed. However each office operates on a different schedule and as result has different hours of work. Energy audit 1 was completed in March, 2014 by SNC Lavalin O&M department; a previous energy audit was conducted in April 2011 however no upgrades were implemented to the building. During March 2014, audit assessment of the energy savings potential of the facility was completed, and a site walk-through was conducted that included interviews with site personnel. From energy audit, the following information was summarized. Energy consumption of the building is relatively low in comparison to similar building in this region. But this is could be due to the fact that some tenants receive individual bills and although it was a priority to track all bills for this building, but some bills could be paid separately. Therefore for further calculations and comparison energy index will be increased by 24

3.1 Description of Buildings 10% to approximate missing information. By applying this assumption this would bring the overall level of energy consumption to more realistic value. Heating and cooling for second floor of the building is provided by packaged rooftop units (electric cooling and gas heating) with VAV system. Building also uses electric fan-coil heaters (this used at the entrance), and individual split A/C systems with electric heaters in the air-handling unit. The fresh air to the building is provided by louvers. All tenants are individually metered for energy consumption, therefore pay for it separately. Building #7 is located at Ottawa, Ontario. Overview: 4 story building is mostly an office building with typical building operating hours from Monday to Friday from 8am to 5pm, on Saturdays and Sundays, the building is closed (except rooftop units). Building was constructed in 1993, with total floor area of 8,180 m2 . Energy audit 1 was completed in December, 2008 by SNC Lavalin O&M department. During this audit information was collected on site and preliminary calculations included description for each measure of energy savings. From energy audit, the following information was summarized. Energy consumption of the building is slightly higher in comparison to similar building in this region. Increased energy consumption is due to the rooftop units operating 24/7, but because the building has a big atrium energy, consumption balances due to the wasted floor space. Domestic hot water is heated by electric water heaters located through the building. Building does not have Building Automation System; all controls on HVAC equipment are mechanical or pneumatic. Building has variable air volume (VAV) rooftop units that provide conditioned ventilation air to the 3rd and 4th floors of the building, similar smaller units provide conditioned air to the atrium. Air-handling units (AHU) provide air to the suites on the rest of the floors. Atrium is heated by three gas-fired rooftop units. Building #8 is located at Ottawa, Ontario. Overview: A 5-story building, mostly an office building with total floor area of 5,020 m2 , and heated underground garage. Building was constructed in 1989. Typical building operating hours are from Monday to Friday from 7am to 7pm, on Saturdays from 7am to 5pm, and on Sundays, the building is closed. Garage operates 24/7. Energy audit 1 was completed in November, 2008 by SNC Lavalin O&M department. During this audit discussions with client for background information was completed, in addition site visit and discussions with building operators was conducted, all this information was analyzed with backup of utility bills and analysis of potential retrofit measures were prepared. From energy audit, the following information was summarized. Energy consumption of the building is very high in comparison to similar building in this region. Building has high energy consumption due to following factors: first is the rooftop equipment that operated 24/7, also heated underground parking (maintained to 15C during winter), and in addition make-up air (MUA) units appears to be oversized. Domestic hot water for the building is provided by electric water heater in the basement electrical room. Building does not have Building Automation System, and all controls on HVAC equipment are mechanical or pneumatic. Climatemaster rooftop units provide conditioned ventilation air to the building, and it operates 24/7. Building also has electric humidifier, but it is not operating. Rooftop also holds packaged heat/cool 25

3.1 Description of Buildings unit, and various split A/C condensing units. Building #9 is located at Ottawa, Ontario, Tower C. Overview: A 3-story building is an office building contracted in 1989, with total floor area of 4,854 m2 . Building has exterior parking for 165 spaces, there is no interior parking. Typical building operating hours are from Monday to Friday from 7am to 7pm, and its typically closed on Saturdays and Sundays. Energy audit 1 was completed in June, 2010 by SNC Lavalin O&M department. During this audit assessment of the energy savings potential of the facility was completed, and a site walk-through was conducted that included interviews with site personnel. From energy audit, the following information was summarized. Energy consumption of the building is average in comparison to similar building in this region. Heating in the building is provided by electricity. Domestic hot water also is provided by electricity and is sourced by water tanks. Energy audit that was performed for this building suggests upgrading windows glazing, given the age of the building the glazing is not up to current efficiency level, and heat penetration through building envelope into the building is higher. Building #10 is located at Ottawa, Ontario, Tower B. Overview: a 5-story building is an office building constructed in 1989 with total floor area of 8,270 m2 . Total building occupancy is 732 with current occupancy of approximate 600 people. Typical building operating hours are from Monday to Friday from 6am to 6pm; however some tenants remain in the building until 8pm. Energy audit 1 was completed in December, 2010 by SNC Lavalin O&M department. During this audit assessment of the energy savings potential of the facility was completed, and a site walk-through was conducted that included interviews with site personnel. During site visit some of the areas were not accessible due to security concerns, but nevertheless site audit allowed for the initial selection of energy conservation measures. From energy audit following information was summarized. Energy consumption of the building is very high in comparison to similar building in this region, and in comparison to BOMA energy efficient building value of 1.05 GJ/m2 /year however it is much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2 /year. High energy consumption is due to the data center which is located in the basement and ground floor of the building. Generally data center requires higher amount of equipment and consumed more energy. Therefore to provide more accurate assumptions, data center is factored out of analysis as 25% of the buildings overall energy usage (based on the area of data center). The electricity used by the tenants of data center is related to cooling equipment. The facility is equipped with an electrical meter by the utility to maintain night and holiday schedules. In addition, the building has Building Automation System (BAS) to monitor and control key systems of the building. Building heating is served by electricity, and there is no natural gas in the building. The main entrance vestibule of the building is heated by an electric forced fan heater.

Energy Intensity Calculations

To determine energy intensity of each case-study building, meta-analysis data set will combine energy-use data from utility bills and audits Level 1 measures, from two sources namely: EnergyCAP and CAMS (SNC Lavalin O&M databases). Utility bills information (electricity and natural gas consumption) for the range of years was obtained through energy tracking service, which monitors billing data using the EnergyCAP software application. This data was considered in the analysis to obtain an overall picture of the buildings monthly and annual energy consumption. EnergyCAP software provides the following information: actual data (summary, commodity of electric, natural gas, and water; monthly consumption, greenhouse gas emissions. For each category, data is split up into: total cost, energy cost percentage, daily average cost. Savings: summary, commodity, monthly (water, natural gas). For each commodity: monthly energy bills and demand. For each case-study building utility invoices were analyzed, following procedure was utilized and all results and summary can be found in Appendix A. Utility bill analysis (general overview of the buildings various energy consumption levels), utility analysis summary (general overview of various consumption data for the particular facility), trending report for high energy consumption year and low energy consumption year (this is an equivalent kWh per square meter graph of the various types of energy used in the facility normalized by number of days in the month. Equation per month is as follows: kWh per month/building area m2/#days per month. By dividing the GJ/m2 values by the number of days in a given month, energy consumption is normalized). Comparison of energy intensity for high energy consumption year and low energy consumption year, average energy intensity is plotted to be compared to the BOMA benchmark value. Linear Regression for total energy consumption per degree days (here mathematical equation that defines the linear line is given on the graph itself. The relationship between energy consumed and weather (degree days) was plotted. The higher the degree days, the higher the energy consumption should be. The dots on the graph represent actual energy (electricity and natural gas) consumption. This is measured by the value R2 and the closer R2 is to 1.0 the better the trending. For buildings with negative trending, there may be an opportunity for improvements, if the dot is above the line; this indicates an occasion where high consumption may not have been warranted. During utility bills evaluations, attention was paid to understanding utility rate structure that applies to the facility, also to notice any additional utility monthly charges and disregard any inconsistent data. Calculations of energy index for Building #1 are shown below as an example; calculations for the rest of the case-study buildings can be found in Appendix A. Energy CAP database was utilized to collect energy consumption information for the building. Energy consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #1 utility bills were provided from December 2006 to March 2015. To complete most accurate analysis, utility bills for 2007 to 2014 were only analyzed because 2006 and 2015 has incomplete data. Following calculations were done based on utility bills: sum of electrical total cost per year, sum of gas total cost per year, sum of electrical consumption per year and sum of gas consumption per year. By having total floor area 29

3.2 Calculations for the entire building of 25,424 m2 , energy index in GJ/m2 /year was calculated. From calculations it was noticed that 2008 provides inconsistent values in comparison with the rest of years, therefore for calculations of average yearly energy index 2008 year was excluded. By summarizing utility bills data following calculations were made:

Average

As it was specified in energy audit, energy consumption of the Building #1 is moderately high in comparison to similar office buildings in same region; and therefore average energy index which equals to 1.13 GJ/m2 /yr is also high in comparison to benchmark values of BOMA energy efficient building value of 1.05 GJ/m2 /yr or National Resources Canada value of 1.43 GJ/m2 /yr. Two charts below (Figure 3.5 and 3.6) show electricity and gas consumption per year. Electricity consumption chart demonstrates prominent increase in energy usage, 2012 and 2014 shows the highest values. However gas consumption chart does not increase in such an obvious pattern, but the highest gas consumption values are also in more recent years 2013 and 2014. 30

Figure 3.7: Example Building #1 Yearly Energy Intensity Comparison

Because weather varies from day to day and year to year, normalization measures provide the best solution to represent how weather impacts energy consumption of the building. Energy used for heating and cooling is directly dependant on how cold or hot it was during a specific year or season. Weather normalization was applied on year with the lowest energy usage, so it could be compared to the year with highest energy usage. Comparing normalized data showed actual energy consumption not dependant on weather during such periods. Data for heating and cooling degree days was taken from weatherstats.ca webpage. By using total degree days (HDD plus CDD) normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #1. Based on plotted results, shown below in the chart (Figure 3.8), it can be concluded that energy consumption for 2013 is higher than for 2011. This proves that regardless of weather conditions, 2013 has higher energy consumptions than in 2011. Implementing trend-line equations, the average equation was calculated:  = 3.1724x + 1340.45 From the above equation, normalized average energy index was calculated as 1.14 GJ/m2 /yr; this value is slightly higher than average for 2007 to 2014 years range. Calculated value will be used for further 32

WWR Calculations

To calculate WWR for each case-study building, architectural drawings were utilized; architectural drawings were available only for four case-study buildings: #1, #2, #3 and #4. From elevations as well as cross-sections details drawings WWR was calculated for each building. For the rest of the building, where architectural drawings were not available, either a site visit was conducted or assumptions were made from photographs and Google Earth 3D images. WWR was calculated based on the equation provided in (Public works and Government Services Canada, 2002) guide. Complete calculations for each building can be found in Appendix B.

Building Envelope Thermal Resistance Calculations

Architectural drawings as well as information provided in energy audits reports were used to analyze building envelopes of case-study buildings: ­ Building Envelope for Building #1 consists of typical cavity wall with architectural concrete block, concrete block on the inside and insulation in between. Windows are mostly double glazed curtain wall assemblies. Built-up roof with precast concrete pavers, insulation, roofing membrane and structural slab sloped to drain. ­ Building Envelope for Building #2 consists of a typical cavity wall with brick from the outside, concrete block and stud framing with R-8 batt insulation. Double glazed windows have thermally broken aluminum window frames. Built-up roof consists of stone ballast on fabrene sheet, rigid insulation, single ply membrane and sloped concrete. 35

3.2 Calculations ­ Building Envelope for Building #3 consists of typical wall system such as tinted gray glazing in precast concrete panels. At the first level, windows are clear glass in aluminum frames. Typical roof system is built-up roofing with rigid insulation, vapor barrier and concrete slab.

­ Building Envelope for Building #4 consists of double cable type clear anodized aluminum frame set into curtain wall framing, also insulated prefinished metal siding with frameless butt glazing. Typical roof consists of precast concrete pavers on precast waterproofing membrane and sloped concrete.

­ Building Envelope for Building #9, #10 and #11 consists of granite and double glazed curtain wall, and built-up roof. Insulation values could not be ascertained on site without destructive testing; therefore assumptions for thermal resistance will be made. Windows are heavily tinted. Architectural drawings were only available for four buildings, but one set of drawings (for building #4) was incomplete; therefore, building envelope components were not specified. Also, energy audits only provided brief building envelope description for buildings #9, #10 and #11, and calculations of thermal resistance were not possible. Due to such restrictions, thermal resistance was only calculated for buildings #1, #2 and #3. For thermal resistance calculations, assumptions for building envelope assembly components were based on ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2010 (CHAPTER 26), Table 4 Typical Thermal Properties of Common Building and Insulating Materials. However architectural drawings provided typical walls and roof construction components, but because construction specifications were not available, numerous assumptions had to be made. Assumptions are listed in spreadsheets used for calculations, and can be found in Appendix C. Existing building RSI-values are compared to "Minimum thermal values requirements of building envelopes as per SB-10", Climate Zone 6, TABLE SB5.5-6, (Supersedes Table 5.5-6 in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1). Based on this, calculation tables (can be found in Appendix C) specify whether higher greater thermal resistance of building component is required or determines if it satisfies the minimum requirements. Summary table below shows thermal resistance of three main building envelope components: wall, roof and windows. All these components are area dependent, therefore effective thermal resistance for overall building envelope for each building was calculated. Following formula (as per SB-10 guidelines) was utilized to calculate effective thermal resistance: Ro = 3Ri Ai /Ao = (R1 A1 + R2 A2 + ... + Rn An )/Ao By analyzing this data it can be concluded that buildings with higher WWR have lower effective thermal resistance due to bigger fenestration area in comparison to more thermally resistant opaque area. Table 6 provides summary of calculated thermal resistance. 36

Analysis
Analysis of Energy Audits

To complete energy audits, SNC Lavalin follows the standard format of reporting, and after reviewing 15 energy audit reports (Phase One) it was concluded that all reports follow similar outline: overview and general information of the building, general findings that included analysis from the utility bills, energy index calculations and load factor analysis, also the initial selection of Energy Conservation Measures (ECM), and at the end energy conservation measures. The conservation measures section includes existing conditions and proposed solutions for various building systems and equipment, such as lighting fixtures replacement, upgrade of thermostat control, retrofit of heating /cooling equipment and others. Some of the audit reports also proposed to conduct further calculations as a solution; such calculations were: to perform heat loss calculations to estimate correct size of heating/cooling equipment, perform retro-commissioning audit on building automation system to identify energy and efficiency opportunities, conduct HVAC capital study that will include analysis and moving forward plan, upgrade lighting schedule, development of replacement plan by providing analysis and ranking the order of which units will be upgraded, and others. As a result, each report provides executive conservation measure summary where high level cost estimate for all upgrades is listed. Reports also provide the next step section, where anticipated implementations are discussed and high level plan of actions is provided. After analyzing all 15 energy audit (Phase One) reports, it was observed that building envelope was only briefly discussed in four reports. Building #3 report proposes to replace single pane outdated windows with new, double pane, thermally broken, solar reflective windows. Building #5 report proposes to upgrade the existing roof due to ponding and signs of deterioration. Building #9 and #11 reports propose to upgrade existing windows by adding supplemental window glazing/shading to help reduce the heat penetration during the cooling season. From this, it can be concluded that building envelope upgrade is not typically considered as a part of the potential energy and cost savings measure during phase one energy audits analysis. However most of the reports claim that energy audit is based on an established process to identify measures for reducing energy consumption (perform renovations to eliminate thermal bridges), measures for improving occupant comfort, and measures for reducing greenhouse emissions, but very small percentage of them discussing building envelope concerns. It is explained in one of energy 37

3.3 Analysis audit reports, that to eliminate thermal bridges in the building would require a full building retrofit; accurately calculating the savings for such a major project is beyond the scope of such report.

3.3.2

Energy Intensity Analysis, Summary of Case-Study Buildings

Below is the summary of all 15 case-study buildings. Table 3.6 provides the year range for which energy bills were available, electricity consumption and cost, gas consumption and cost, and energy intensity result for each building. All case-study buildings are office facilities with typical office hours and in most cases with typical occupancy (except #2 and #6 with retail space, #13 with billiard hall/restaurant space, and #14 with space dedicated for Montreal Police). Based on these and other differences, buildings have inconsistent energy consumption.

Table 3.6: Summary of Case-Study Buildings (Energy Intensity Calculations)

As it was specified previously, energy intensity benchmark value is used from BOMA report, where average energy use intensity for certified Office Buildings, is 27.1 ekWh/ft2 /yr (or 1.05GJ/m2 /yr). The chart below (Figure 3.9) demonstrates the comparison of energy intensity of each case-study building to BOMAs average value. 38

3.3 Analysis

Figure 3.9: Energy Intensity vs. BOMAs Average Value

Two buildings #8 and #10 show significantly higher value from the benchmark value and building #5 shows very low value in comparison to the rest of the buildings. More than half of the case-study buildings have energy index value around benchmark BOMA value; this demonstrates that buildings are performing at levels as per BOMA benchmark.

As it was mentioned before, buildings are divided into four main shape categories, however in charts below (Figure 3.10) combined complex shapes into one category. 39

By grouping building based on their building shape, analysis didnt show much of the consistency. Buildings in all categories have energy intensity values higher than BOMA benchmark energy intensity value; however square shape category, which only contains three buildings, has only energy intensity higher than BOMA value and not lower. Following analysis were conducted to conclude how age of the building influence energy intensity results, and linear progression was plotted (Figure 3.13). Most of the buildings were constructed between 1970 and 1993; only one building was constructed in 1873. Surprisingly Building #12, which was built in 19th century, has relatively low energy consumption in comparison to the newer buildings. Figure below (Left) includes all buildings, and demonstrates increasing pattern of trendline direction. Additional figure (that excludes Building #12 that was constructed in 1873), shows very steady pattern however there is also an increase into positive direction. Two buildings with the highest energy consumption were both constructed in the same year 1989. This summarizes that selected case-studies do not imply that older building have higher energy consumption in comparison to newer constructed buildings. Most of the buildings selected for this research are midrise buildings, however to divide these building into categories all building were grouped into low-rise (1 to 3 floors), mid-rise (4 to 5 floors), and high-rise (6 to 12). Each category has 5 buildings. Figure 3.14 shows that linear trendline has increasing pattern in regards to energy consumption of these buildings reflected as energy intensity index. Low-rise buildings show the lowest energy consumption, and mid-rise having the highest. Additionally Figure 3.14 shows how energy intensity correlates with height of each building. From chart can be concluded that, based on case-study buildings, mid-rise building with height 41

WWR analysis

Figure 3.15 outlines the relationship between energy intensity and the WWR of 15 case-study buildings. All buildings WWR range between 20% to 45%; only one building has a WWR lower than 20%, as well as none of the building have WWR higher than 45%. Trendline was plotted to identify which direction the chart is approaching: upwards or downwards. 42

3.4 WWR analysis

Figure 3.15: Energy Intensity vs. WWR

In addition, WWR was plotted against age of the buildings (Figure 3.16), to see if newer buildings have higher fenestration areas. From the chart below, it is shown that newer building do have higher WWR, and building #12 which was constructed in 1873 has the lowest fenestration area therefore WWR. It has to be noted that energy consumption data for all buildings was analyzed to exclude any inconsistency, as well as normalized to calculate the most accurate average energy index that does not depend on weather conditions for a specific year.

Thermal Resistance Analysis

Due to limited access to architectural drawings as well as incomplete information, thermal resistance analysis can be only completed for three buildings: #1, #2 and #3. Figure 21 below demonstrates the relationship between effective thermal resistance, WWR and energy intensity.

Two buildings, Building #1 and #2 show proportional relationship between thermal resistance and energy intensity; the higher the thermal resistance, the lower energy intensity the building has. Building #3 has very low thermal resistance, and as expected very high energy intensity index and therefore energy consumption. However data was only available for three buildings, but nevertheless results demonstrated an expected outcome. In regards to WWR, results are not very consistent; the building with the highest WWR has 0.98 (K*m2 )/W effective thermal resistance, which fall at the middle between three buildings. Another two buildings show expected results; the higher the WWR, the lower effective thermal resistance the building has.

3.6

Building Indicators That Impact Energy Consumption

For case-study buildings, major energy consumption breakdown lies between electricity and natural gas consumption. Figure 3.18 show the summary of the percentage breakdown in energy consumption for each facility for the average yearly energy consumption. For comparison purposes, the natural gas and electricity have been converted to common unit of energy (GJ). 44

3.7 Energy Balance

Energy Balance

In order to identify where energy is used in the buildings, energy balance was completed for the facility. The energy balance identifies the electricity and natural gas consumption by individual systems; it also analyses if that consumption is weather dependant. Energy balance approach demonstrates the overall relative impact of the architectural features on the heating and cooling loads of the building. The larger percentage represents those elements that have a greater impact on heating and cooling loads therefore more attention should be given to these architectural features. Typically energy balance values are estimated based on ammeter readings, equipment schedules and software modelling. Figures 3.19 and 3.20, show energy balance for the typical office building.

45

3.7 Energy Balance

Figure 3.20: (Left) - Cooling Loads Percentage Distribution for Typical Office, (Right) - Pie Chart of these Values

These values were calculated based on case-study energy audits reports as well as Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), 2014. Research study prepared by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), (2014) provides percentages of the overall relative impact of the architectural features on the heating loads and cooling loads for MURBs. Values were slightly adjusted to suit typical office buildings; assumptions were made based on case-study energy audits. The Other category includes all other parameters that might influence a typical office building. Figures 3.19 and 3.20 summarises percentage distribution for heating and cooling. Percentage distribution example can be found in Appendix D. The pie chart below (Figure 3.21) demonstrates average percentages of energy use by end-use for commercial/institutional buildings as per National Resources Canada (NRC), 2010.

Percentage distribution from Figure 3.21 were analysed against energy audit reports for building 46

3.7 Energy Balance #7 (301 Moodie Drive, Ottawa, Ontario), and #8 (303 Moodie Drive, Ottawa, Ontario), and energy balance breakdown was calculated (shown in Figure 3.22).

Figure 3.22: Energy Balance of Case-Study Buildings, (Left) Electricity, (Right) - Gas

Buildings total energy consumption indicators include the following: heating (includes the heating load for external areas and the heating load attributed to fresh air), air conditioning (includes cooling and de-humidification of fresh air and the air conditioning load for internal and external areas), lighting (corresponds to the proportion of consumption attributable to light fixtures), motive power (represents consumption associated with pumps, fan motors and elevator motors), plug loads (represents all the loads not included in the other items and electricity consumption of all office equipment including workstations, printers and photocopying machines), humidification (represents consumption associated with the humidification of fresh air), and hot water (corresponds to the heating load required to produce domestic hot water). Heating, cooling and lighting consume significant percentage of electricity and gas usage of the typical office building. Based on a previously reviewed literature, the exact percentage was not provided on how architectural features of the building impact lighting energy consumption. Therefore, an assumption was made based on calculations provided in Ross (2009) report as WWR accounts for 40% of lighting loads. The following analyses were completed to conclude the total energy consumption impacted by WWR for each case study building. This was achieved by applying energy balance for electricity and gas consumption as well as heating, cooling and lighting loads energy distribution per architectural features, for each case-study building. 47

3.7 Energy Balance Table 3.7: Heating Loads Distribution (Electricity) in GJ Based on Architectural Features Indicators

Calculations above (Table 3.7) are based on electricity consumption in (GJ). To be able to compare values between all buildings, data was introduced as energy intensity (divided by total floor area of each building); calculated values are shown in the table below. WWR impacts 15% of overall electricity consumption of the heating loads. Table 3.8 contains the same data but is introduced through energy index value (GJ/m2 /year). Table 3.8: Heating Loads Distribution (Electricity) in GJ/m2 /year Based on Architectural Features Indicators

Similar calculations were completed for electricity consumption for cooling loads, gas consumption 48

3.8 Analysis Summary Table 3.11: WWR Percentage of Total Energy Consumption

Table 3.11 summarizes the percentage that WWR consumes from overall building energy consumption, based on heating, cooling and lighting energy balance. The same loads percentage distribution was applied for all buildings, but based on normalized energy intensity value, electricity and gas consumption percentages vary; some buildings do not use natural gas for building operations and this also influenced calculations. As per these results, WWR impacts significant percentage of energy consumption for these case-study buildings.

3.8

Analysis Summary

WWR is directly related to energy intensity of existing building, however set of data calculated from fifteen case-study buildings showed very inconsistent analysis. To summarize all data in relationship to energy intensity, box plot analysis were performed. Typically box plot analysis demonstrates statistical analysis of the set of data, but in this case due to sample size bias it act more as the summary and not statistical analysis. This type of analysis was chosen as a very clear approach to demonstrate patterns of response for each category. Here the overall size of the box plot (how much it stretches on the y-axis) shows how spread out the data is. If the box itself is very short, then most of the data is huddled close together. Data in different boxes can be compared by looking at how tall or short the boxes are, and also their position relative to one another. If the boxes are roughly centered, then there is little or no difference in average or median between the data sets. If there is a shift between the boxes, then there likely is a statistically significant difference in average or median for the data sets. From tables below 50

3.8 Analysis Summary it can be concluded that all of the box plots compared are relatively similar. This implies that there is little significant difference between the data groups. Figure 3.23 demonstrates frequency of energy intensity value, for here is can be concluded that most of the buildings have energy intensity around 1-1.25 GJ/m2 /year, meaning that they are relatively energy efficient building in relationship to BOMA benchmark.

Case-study buildings with more complex shape and mid-rise buildings have very wide range of energy intensity data. 52

3.8 Analysis Summary

Figure 3.27: Boxplot Analysis of WWR to Energy Intensity

In addition boxplot analyses were completed to compare window-to-wall energy consumption to WWR. Essentially, Figure 31 is showing that the WWR doesn't have direct impact on the energy intensity (EI). The boxes (which are actually 2 quartiles) are almost the same size and line up almost perfectly well. This means that the middle 50% of each data set are very similar. The horizontal line inside the box is the median, or the middle value of the entire data set for each group, here they are very close to being lined up, which means the medians are very similar. The little crosshair sign at the middle is an average value; again these are lined up pretty well, so the average of each group is almost the same. Lastly, the vertical lines extending above and below the boxes each represent 25% of the data points (the lowest and highest quartile). The fact that the top lines are roughly the same size means that they upper 25% of each data set look very similar. Data ¿40% has a much longer lower quartile line, this means that there is one value that reaches all the way down to 0.50, while the first box has a min value closer to 0.9 (there's only a little stub of a line on the first box). From boxplot analysis of energy intensity versus WWR can be concluded that regardless how inconsistent and spread-out data is, buildings with WWR of more than 40% did not show higher results in terms of energy intensity.

Following two steps, energy consumption related to WWR was analyzed in comparison to overall building energy consumption. Here data from energy balance calculations was utilized. 53

3.8 Analysis Summary

Figure 3.28: Boxplot Analysis of WWR Energy Consumption (GJ/m2 /year) to WWR

As seen above in Figure 3.28, there is no significant difference when comparing WWR Consumption to WWR%. Note that the boxes are roughly centered and are approximately equally sized. However, there is a little more variation in energy intensity when the WWR% is greater than 40%. Also energy intensity was analysed in regards to WWR. As seen below in Figure 3.29, there is also no significant difference when comparing WWR Consumption to WWR%. The same trend of more variation in the data is seen with a WWR 40%, but the boxes are still centered and the same size.

Figure 3.29: Boxplot Analysis of Energy Intensity to WWR

Lastly comparison analysis of overall buildings energy intensity to WWR energy consumption, which 54

3.9 Conclusions was calculated through energy balance, was performed. As shown in Figure 3.30, there is a slight positive correlation between the Overall Energy Intensity and the WWR Energy Consumption, as noted by the R2 value of 0.61. This means that 61% of the variation in the data (the distance above and below the line) can be explained by normal variation. This implies that there may be other external parameters that may be affecting the data, either by themselves, or in conjunction with one another. The bubbles size shows the relative value of the WWR%. There isn't a discernible pattern to the distribution of bubble size along the trend line. This further emphasizes the above analysis that shows WWR% has very little correlation with either the Energy Intensity or the WWR Energy Consumption.

Figure 3.30: Overall Energy Intensity vs. WWR Energy Intensity

Conclusions

WWR is directly related to energy intensity of existing building, fifteen case-study buildings were analysed to calculate how energy intensity of existing case-study office buildings compare with averages for similar buildings, and those that would be resulting from the application of current standards. As for the energy intensity benchmark value BOMA average energy use intensity for certified Office Buildings (1.05GJ/m2 /yr) was selected, and for minimum WWR benchmark SB-10 for building envelope prescriptive requirement (below 40%). Calculations for case-study buildings showed that the building shape didnt directly influence energy intensity, however analysis based on the age of the building showed that the newer buildings are more energy efficient, and analysis on buildings height concluded that taller case study buildings have higher energy intensity, therefore energy consumption. Energy balance exercise was completed to analyse the impact of five architectural features such as number of stories, building orientation, WWR, building thermal performance and opaque wall thermal performance on energy consumption, based on energy distribution. This helped to determine the potential for energy savings in existing case-study buildings through envelope upgrades. Calculations showed that based on energy balance and energy loads distribution (as per architectural features indicators), WWR impacts 55

3.9 Conclusions on average 15% of overall energy consumption. By evaluation, using the energy audit (Level One) report, it is believed that it would be extremely beneficial to introduce the analysis of WWR into energy audit procedure. However prescriptive requirements of SB-10, which is based on 40% WWR, are aiming for energy efficient design, but the possibility is that building's energy consumption could be even increased. If the shape of the building is complex, it is not feasible to fit it under the same standards. Energy intensity of the buildings cannot be directly related to its WWR; although 15% of energy consumption could be linked to percentage of fenestration area in relationship to wall area.

Building #2 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations for Energy Index for Building #2  Similar procedure as was utilized for Building #1 was done for Building #2. Energy CAP database was utilized to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity and gas. For Building #2 utility bills were provided from December 2006 to March 2015. Summarized  yearly  data  showed  relatively  consistent  values  except  gas  consumption  for  2014  year,  this  is  could  have  been  due  to  additional  equipment  installation  after  energy  audit  proposal.  Therefore  2014  total  energy  consumption  was  not  included  in  average  energy  index  calculations.  By  having  total  floor  area  of  8,225  m2  energy index was calculated in GJ/m2/yr.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

Similarly to energy audit conclusion that energy consumption of the building is moderately high in comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  energy  index  value  showed  high  results  as  well  in  comparison  to  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr  or  but  lower  than  average  National  Resources  Canada  value of 1.43 GJ/m2/yr.  Two charts below show electricity and gas consumption per year for Building #2. Electricity consumption chart  demonstrates steady but not very prominent increase in energy usage; however 2014 shows the highest value.  But  because  2014  will  not  be  used  for  further  calculations  due  to  inconsistency,  therefore  2013  considered  as  62

the  highest  value.  Gas  consumption  chart  show  values  that  vary  a  lot  from  year  to  year,  there  is  prominent  decrease  in  gas  consumption  in  2012  and  2013,  but  because  2014  data  is  very  inconsistent  it's  not  reasonable  to  conclude  that  gas  consumption  of  the  Building  #2  decreasing  and  more  efficient.  Another  assumption  can  be  made  that  2014  gas  utility  bills  data  actually  contains  partial  gas  consumption  from  2012  and  2013,  but  from utility bills information this cannot be confirmed.

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  fluctuating.  The  lowest  energy  index  was in 2009 and highest in 2011. These two years' data will be used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized  total  energy  consumption  was  calculated  for  Building  #2  for  2011  and  2009  as  they  represent  highest  and  lowest  energy  consumption  respectively.  Based  on  plotted  results,  shown  below  in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2011  is  higher  than  for  2009.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2011  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2009.  Implementing  trendline  equations,  average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.21  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Building #3 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #3  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #3 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  of  9,240  m2  energy  intensity  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  electricity  and  gas  utility  bills  provided  relatively  consistent data, therefore all years' data from 2007 to 2014 were included in calculations.     Utility bills analysis showed following:

As it was specified in energy audit, energy consumption of the Building #3 is moderately high in comparison to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.38  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  high  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr  and  around average value of National Resources Canada value of 01.43 GJ/m2/yr.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  demonstrates  prominent  decrease  in  consumption  from  2007  to  2011,  and  although  2012  shows  higher  value,  overall  electricity  consumption  is  decreasing.  Gas  consumption  chart  doesn't  show  such  results,  2011  shows  slightly  inconsistent gas consumption result, but fluctuation of consumption is prominent through entire yearly range.

 Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  fluctuating  over  years  it's  calculated,  and  2011  and  2014  show  very  similar  results.  The  lowest  energy  index  was  in  2009  and  highest  in  2011.  These  two years' data will be used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #3. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2011  at  some  point  is  intersecting  with  2009,  but  nevertheless  shows  higher  results.  Regardless  of  weather  conditions  2011  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than in 2009. Implementing trendline equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.36  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Building #4 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #4  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #4 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  15,712  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  gas  consumption  in  2012  is lower than other years, but this year was included in calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #4  is  average  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.08  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  average  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  however value is much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  fluctuating  throughout  years  but  doesn't  show  any  significant  improvement  or  degradation.  On  the  other  hand  gas  consumption  show  very  low  value  in  2012,  this  could  be  due  to  the  fact  that  some  of  the  gas  utility  bills  were

carried  into  2013,  however  by  analyzing  billing  information  it  was  not  possible  to  come  to  such  conclusion  certainly.

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for which data is available. Chart below shows that energy index value is fluctuation through given year range,  and  in  recent  years  is  even  lower  than  in  2010  or  2007.  The  lowest  energy  index  was  in  2010  and  highest  in  2009. These two years' data will be used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #4. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2009  is  higher  than  for  2010.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2009  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2010.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.09  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Building #5 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #5  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #5 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  6,332  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  Calculations  didn't  show  very  significant  inconsistency;  therefore all years' data was included for calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #5  is  very  low  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  0.36  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  very  low  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  however  value is much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  doesn't  demonstrate  prominent  increase  or  decrease  in  energy  usage.  Electricity  utility  bills  data  show  2008  having  much  higher  consumption  than  other  years.  Gas  utility  bills  data  evenly  fluctuating  throughout  range  of  years  without prominent increase or decrease trend; but 2014 is approaching the highest value.  86

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  fluctuating  through  yearly  range  given. The lowest energy index was in 2012 and highest in 2008. These two years' data will be used for further  calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #5. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  normalized  energy  consumption  for  2008  and  2012  approaching  similar  alignment  therefore  have  very  close  values.  This  proves  that  weather  conditions  could  impact  energy  consumptions for these two years. Implementing trendline equations, average equation was calculated: 

From above equation normalized average energy index was calculated as 0.36 GJ/m2/yr, this value is the same  as average for 2007 to 2014 years range. As it was mentioned before energy consumption will be increased by  20% to provide more accurate evaluations. Therefore new energy intensity index 0.45 GJ/m2/yr; this value will  be used for further casestudy buildings comparison.

Building #6 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #6  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #1 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  2,130  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  yearly  data  is  relatively  consistent, therefore all years values were included in calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #6  is  relatively  low  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  0.86  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  low  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  however value is much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  fluctuates  throughout  the  year  range  without  any  prominent  increase  or  decrease.  But  gas  consumption  chart  shows  prominent decrease in values, however from utility bills analysis there is no obvious reason why this occurred.

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  gradually  decreasing  and  currently  around 0.80 GJ/m2/yr and much lower than in 2007 of 1.11 GJ/m2/yr. The lowest energy index was in 2012 and  highest in 2008. These two years' data will be used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #6. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2008  is  higher  than  for  2012.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2008  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2012.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  0.93  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  significantly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  As  it  was  discussed  previously,  to  reflect  more  accurate  energy  consumption  it  should  be  multiplied  by  10%,  therefore  new  value  is  1.02  GJ/m2/yr.  This  value  will be used for further casestudy buildings comparison.

Building #7 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #7  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #7 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  8,180  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  utility  bills  data  provided  consistent information and therefore all years were included for calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #7  is  high  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.18  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  high  in comparison to benchmark values of BOMA energy efficient building value of 1.05 GJ/m2/yr, however value is  much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  demonstrates  decrease  in  energy  usage,  with  lowest  usage  in  2014.  However  gas  consumption  chart  doesn't  show  values  that prominently increasing or decreasing, but more recent years are approaching better efficiency.

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  decreasing  and  currently  has  the  lowest  value  of  1.04  GJ/m2/yr.  The  lowest  energy  index  was  in  2014,  but  due  to  utility  bills  inconsistency  in  2014  for  normalization  calculation  2010  will  be  used.  The  highest  energy  consumption  is  in  2008.  These  two  years' data will be used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #7. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2008  is  higher  than  for  2010.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2008  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2010.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.21  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings  comparison.

Building #8 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #8  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #1 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  5,020  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  2011  gas  consumption  show  very  inconsistent  value  in  comparison  to  other  years,  but  overall  2011  data  wasn't  excluded  from  calculations. After analysing gas utility bills in more details, was concluded that this inconsistency could be due  to some of the bills transferred from 2010 to 2011.     Utility bills analysis showed following:

As it was specified in energy audit, energy consumption of the Building #8 is very high in comparison to similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.92  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  high  in comparison to benchmark values of BOMA energy efficient building value of 1.05 GJ/m2/yr and then average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year..  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  demonstrates  prominent  decrease  in  energy  usage,  2013  and  2014  have  the  lowest  energy  consumption  values.  Gas  consumption chart shows big jump in 2011, but at it was discussed earlier this could be due to gas bills.       110

Energy Intensity

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #8. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2007  is  higher  than  for  2014.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2007  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2014.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.93  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Building #9 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #9  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption was provided by utility bills for electricity and gas. For Building #9 utility bills were provided from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  4,854  m2, energy index in GJ/m2/year was calculated. From calculations it was noticed that energy bills provided very  consistent data therefore all years data was included in calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #9  is  average  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.04  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  high  in comparison to benchmark values of BOMA energy efficient building value of 1.05 GJ/m2/yr, however value is  much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  shows  data  that  fluctuation  throughout  years  range.  However  on  the  other  side  gas  consumption  chart  demonstrates  decrease in gas usage.

Normalized total energy consumption was calculated for Building #9. Based on plotted results, shown below in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2008  is  higher  than  for  2013.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2008  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2013.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.07  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Building #10 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #10  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity.  For  Building  #10  utility  bills  were  provided  from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  8,270  m2, energy index in GJ/m2/year was calculated. From calculations it was noticed that electricity consumption is  noticeably increasing.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #10  is  very  high  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.13  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  high  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  and  then average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year..  Charts  below  show  electricity  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  demonstrates  prominent  increase in energy usage.

 Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  gradually  increasing  and  currently  around  3.72  GJ/m2/yr;  this  value  is  very  high.  The  lowest  energy  index  was  in  2007  and  highest  in  2014.  These  two years' data will be used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized  total  energy  consumption  was  calculated  for  Building  #10.  Based  on  plotted  results,  shown  below  in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2014  is  much  higher  than  for  2007.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2014  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2007.  Implementing  trendline equations, average equation was calculated: 

127

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  2.34  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  lower  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  As  it  was  discussed  previously,  to  demonstrate  more  accurate  energy  consumption  of  the  building,  current  value  should  be  only  75%;  therefore  new  energy  intensity index value is 1.76 GJ/m2/yr. This value will be used for further casestudy buildings comparison.

Building #11 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #11  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity  only  as  gas  is  not  used  by  this  building.  For  Building  #1  utility bills were provided from December 2006 to March 2015. To complete most accurate analysis utility bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  6,162  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that utility bills provide consistent data for all years, therefore all data will be used for calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As it was specified in energy audit, energy consumption of the Building #11 is average in comparison to similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  1.07  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  average  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  however value is much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year..  Electricity  consumption  chart  below  shows  consumption  per  year;  it  doesn't  demonstrate  prominent  increase  or decrease in consumption, however recent years shows lower values therefore improvement.

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  gradually  decreasing  and  currently  around 0.97 GJ/m2/yr.  The lowest energy index was  in 2013 and highest in 2008. These two years' data will be  used for further calculations and comparisons.

Energy Intensity

Normalized  total  energy  consumption  was  calculated  for  Building  #11.  Based  on  plotted  results,  shown  below  in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2008  is  higher  than  for  2013.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2008  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2013.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

134

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.1  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings  comparison.

Building #12 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #12  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity  and  gas.  For  Building  #12  utility  bills  were  provided  from  December  1997  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  1998  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  1997  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  3,518  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  2006  provides  not  consistent  values  in  comparison  with  the  rest  of  years,  therefore  for  calculations  of  average  yearly  energy  index 2006 year was excluded.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #12  is  relatively  low  in  comparison  to  similar  office  buildings  in  same  region;  and  therefore  average  energy  index  which  equals  to  0.91  GJ/m2/yr  is  also  high  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  however value is much lower than average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year.  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  demonstrates  prominent  increase  in  energy  usage.  However  gas  consumption  chart  shows  decrease  in  usage.  As  has  been  mentioned  earlier  2006  shows  very  inconsistent  gas  consumption,  energy  bills  for  this  year  were  analysed  in  details  and  showed  that  in  November  2011  gas  consumption  was  60,347  m3ngas.  Utility  bill  didn't  provide  details  on  why  such  a  high  amount  of  gas  consumption  occurred;  therefore  whole  2006  year  data  was  excluded from calculations.

Yearly  energy  intensity  (index)  was  also  plotted  to  demonstrate  increase  or  decrease  over  the  range  of  years  for  which  data  is  available.  Chart  below  shows  that  energy  index  value  is  gradually  decreasing  excluding  high  jump  in  2006.  The  lowest  energy  index  was  in  1999  and  highest  in  2003,  but  2005  and  2003  were  used  for  further calculations and comparisons, to work with more recent data.

Energy Intensity

Normalized  total  energy  consumption  was  calculated  for  Building  #12.  Based  on  plotted  results,  shown  below  in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2003  is  higher  than  for  2005.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2003  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2005.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  0.94  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  moderately  higher  than  average  for  1999  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  case study buildings comparison.

Building #13 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #13  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity  and  gas.  For  Building  #13  electricity  utility  bills  were  provided  from  December  1995  to  March  2015;  gas  utility  bills  were  provided  from  January  2003  to  March  2015. To complete most accurate analysis utility bills for 2003 to 2014 were only. By having total floor area for  entire  building  of  8,022  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed  that  gas utility bills for 2012 provides not consistent values in comparison with the rest of years, and afterwards gas  consumption  seems  much  higher  than  in  years  prior  2012.  By  analysing  utility  bills  in  more  details  it  was  not  clear why such inconsistency occurred, therefore for further calculations all years data was included.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

Normalized  total  energy  consumption  was  calculated  for  Building  #13.  Based  on  plotted  results,  shown  below  in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2005  is  higher  than  for  2011.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2005  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2011.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  0.92  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2003  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Building #14 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #14  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity  only,  as  not  gas  is  utilised  in  this  building.  For  Building  #14 utility  bills were provided from December 1999  to March 2015. To complete most accurate analysis utility  bills  for  2000  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  1999  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  7,943  m2,  energy  index  in  GJ/m2/year  was  calculated.  From  calculations  it  was  noticed that yearly consumption provides consistent data throughout years, therefore all years will be used for  calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

Building #15 ­ Utility Bills Analysis Calculations of Energy Index for Building #15  Energy  CAP  database  was  utilized  to  collect  energy  consumption  information  for  the  building.  Energy  consumption  was  provided  by  utility  bills  for  electricity  and  gas.  For  Building  #15  utility  bills  were  provided  from  December  2006  to  March  2015.  To  complete  most  accurate  analysis  utility  bills  for  2007  to  2014  were  only  analyzed  because  2006  and  2015  has  incomplete  data.  By  having  total  floor  area  for  entire  building  of  5,518 m2, energy index in GJ/m2/year was calculated. From calculations it was noticed that electrical utility bills  data  was  consistent  throughout  years,  however  gas  consumption  in  2007  showed  lower  value  in  comparison  to  other  years,  after  analysing  utility  bills  in  more  details  it  was  concluded  that  gas  bills  for  2007  provided  incomplete information. Therefore 2007 was excluded from further calculations.   Utility bills analysis showed following:

As  it  was  specified  in  energy  audit,  energy  consumption  of  the  Building  #15  is  moderately  high  in  comparison  to similar office buildings in same region; and therefore average energy index which equals to 1.68 GJ/m2/yr is  also  high  in  comparison  to  benchmark  values  of  BOMA  energy  efficient  building  value  of  1.05  GJ/m2/yr,  and  then average National Resources Canada value of 1.43GJ/m2/year..  Two  charts  below  show  electricity  and  gas  consumption  per  year.  Electricity  consumption  chart  demonstrates  prominent  decrease  in  energy  usage,  with  2013  and  2014  having  the  lowest  values.  On  the  other  hand  gas  consumption chart show increase in energy consumption with 2014 much higher than previous years.  163

Energy Intensity

Normalized  total  energy  consumption  was  calculated  for  Building  #15.  Based  on  plotted  results,  shown  below  in  the  chart,  it  can  be  concluded  that  energy  consumption  for  2008  is  higher  than  for  2012.  This  proves  that  regardless  of  weather  conditions  2008  has  higher  energy  consumptions  than  in  2012.  Implementing  trendline  equations, average equation was calculated: 

From  above  equation  normalized  average  energy  index  was  calculated  as  1.69  GJ/m2/yr,  this  value  is  slightly  higher  than  average  for  2007  to  2014  years  range.  Calculated  value  will  be  used  for  further  casestudy  buildings comparison.

Energy Balance percentages calculations examples: Relative Impact of Architectural Features on Heating Loads (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), 2014):

Relative Impact of Architectural Features on Cooling Loads (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), 2014):

Figures above were retrieved from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation report completed in November 2014. This report summarizes a research of impact of architectural form on the potential energy performance of multi-unit residential buildings. Research explains that thermal characteristics of wall and window areas of the building envelope, as well as proportion of window area to wall area can have a significant impact on the annual 200

heating and cooling loads of building. Percentages in the figure above were calculated by using computerized hourly building energy consumption modelling to assess the impact of these parameters on heating and cooling loads. Simulations were conducted in Toronto, Ontario, and investigated five different building shapes (floor plate geometries), three wall thermal resistance values, six window performance levels, three window to wall ratios, three balcony configurations, three different number of stories (low-rise 3 storey, mid-rise 5 storey, and high-rise 10 storey), and in four orientations. Facilities comparison was also made on number of suites and occupants. Research results showed that floor plate geometry and building orientation were typically found to have a minor impact on heating loads, however slightly bigger on cooling loads. On the other hand, wall insulation, WWR and window U-value had much greater impacts on heating and cooling loads than other factors.
