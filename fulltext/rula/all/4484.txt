Making the Invisible Visible: Visualization of Music and Lyrics for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Audiences Doctor of Philosophy 2015 David W. Fourney Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Ryerson University

Abstract
Music is a major art form present in all cultures. It is nearly ubiquitous in Western culture. As a shared social experience, music is a shared knowledge space. Some music is so well recognized that people may refer to it by name (e.g., Beethoven's 5th symphony, the Star Wars theme). Signing Deaf communities have indigenous forms of lyrical music. While these may not be melodic in the Western expectation, they still conform to the idea of music as metrical lyrics accompanied by instrumentation. Music is a system made up of several elements and attributes containing discrete information chunks that can be perceived by a human listener. Music communicates complex emotional signals and, in some cultures, has specific conventions designed to manipulate emotions. However, deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing people are unable to fully access the richness of the aural musical experience. This dissertation explores ways to make information that is presented in an auditory modality accessible to those who cannot fully perceive it due to hearing loss or environmental barriers; making the invisible visible. A multi-disciplinary, multi-method project, this research examines the design of visualizations intended to present different kinds of otherwise invisible music information in a visible, entertaining form. Ninety-four people, 66 women and 28 men, who identified themselves as Hard of Hearing (46), Deaf (38), Cochlear Implantees (8), or Deafened (2), participated in one of four experiments. Eight of the 94 participated in a fifth experiment. Research questions included determining the fundamenv

tal properties of music that visualizations must present, determining what emotional responses users might have to visualizations of music information, and determining whether a music experience similar to that of hearing audiences can be experienced via visualizations of music information. Among several findings, this project learned that many deaf, deafened and hard of hearing people are active consumers of music; lyrics represent a key piece of music information hard of hearing people require of any visualization; different visualizations might be better suited to different musical genres or emotional moods; and the set of music visualizations tested convey some types of emotional information but do not obviously communicate the emotional component of the music.

Acknowledgements
This Dissertation was a challenging project. It required quickly gaining a deep understanding of multiple subjects, such as music theory, before I could tackle the research questions themselves. This work, would not have been possible without the support and caring of several people. Special thanks to my supervisor, Dr. Filippo Salustri, for providing me with an excellent atmosphere for doing research. I have been fortunate to have his invaluable guidance, caring, and patience. Dr. Salustri willingly assumed responsibility for the heavy lifting and took the weight off of my shoulders during the low-points of my studies. Without Fil's support, which continued throughout his sabbatical, this work would never have been completed. Thank you to the other members of my Examination Committee: Dr. W. Patrick Neumann, Dr. M. Wahab M. Ismail, and Dr. Kathryn Woodcock of Ryerson University and Dr. Richard Ladner of the University of Washington for agreeing to examine this Dissertation. I am indebted to Dr. Benjamin Bahan of Gallaudet University for a discussion that helped me to shape some of my design ideas. I owe my gratitude to Joe Monkhouse, my Research Assistant, for his time, energy, and attention to detail in transcribing interviews and reviewing focus group data. He also assisted with coding and statistical analyses. This work would have never gotten finished without his help. I would like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Deborah Fels and the students of the Inclusive Media and Design Centre (previously Centre for Learning Technologies), especially Mike P., Jorge, Quoc, and Hong Tai, for making available many resources. Special thanks also to Dr. Frank Russo and the students of his Science of Music, Auditory Research and Technology (SMART) lab, specifically Arla, for their thoughts on my work. Thanks also to the Canadian Hard of Hearing Association (CHHA) for making available to me some space at their conference venue to conduct interviews. Many thanks to my research participants. Without them there would have been no way to do my project. This research benefitted from funding provided by the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Standards Council of Canada (SCC), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). In particular, without the support of a (partial) Toronto Rehab Scholarship in Rehabilitation-related Research for Students with Disabilities, I would not have been able to move to Toronto to begin my studies leading to this Dissertation. I thank my family for their support and my wife for her love and patience. Colleen's dedication and support helped me to focus on my work in the good times as well as the most stressful times. Finally, I am forever grateful for the substantial financial support of my late father, the Rev. Dr. Lloyd Fourney, without which the last two years of my studies would have been impossible.

Chapter 1

Introduction
In Western culture, the presence of music in people's lives is nearly ubiquitous -- music is heard in clubs, restaurants, malls, elevators, etc. People may carry music on them wherever they go using their phones or other music players (e.g., iPods). According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), in 2008, the worldwide music industry generated nearly USD $18B (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), 2009) in music sales. In addition to being an important medium for the conveyance of cultural information, such as shared experience and knowledge (e.g., Rose, 1994), music is entertaining and enjoyable for its own sake. As Hamm, Nettl, and Byrnside state, "we would not have music if it did not do something important for us" (1975, p. 71). This "something important" is "not done by any other activity or any other facet of life." (1975, p. 71). Humans invented music "as a form of social communication, a tool to pass information about the group's shared mental state to a number of individuals at once." (Loersch & Arbuckle, 2013). Traditionally music is a social experience. People sing hymns to affirm their commitment to their church, or national anthems to demonstrate their love of country. People talk to their friends about the music they listen to. People go to concerts to hear music with other people. In this sense, music does not simply entertain, it is a form of connection (Jacobs, 2013, August 5). Many people repeatedly report music evoking emotional responses and memory flashbacks (Janata, Tomic, & Rakowski, 2007), relaxation (Knight & Rickard, 2001), and other experiences which make music pleasurable (Kohut & Levarie, 1950). As Alfred Newman once said, "There is nothing in the world that will make people cry or make them laugh as quickly as music." (Jones, 1937, p. C9). However, music is not only enjoyed on its own. For example, television programs and films are made up of information and content in auditory as well as visual modalities. Combining them in creative ways provides the entertainment value of the show. Once viewed, it is left up to the viewer to capture and then decode this information to surmise the intent of the program's creators. In the same way, emotional content contained in the program or film is also encoded, transmitted, and decoded (Fourney & Fels, 2008). Some of the important emotional information is encoded through the music used. Music accompanying the opening credits might be used to `set the mood' of the program or film. 1

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Music used as background can shape the audience's emotional response to the scene and can affect the audience's interpretation of those emotions. While there can be redundancy with visual effects through facial expression, body language, or special effects, so that the emotional impact is reinforced, the same music can be used to oppose those visual effects such as to show irony or comedy. Such music content can be so powerful that it may carry long-term cultural significance (Fourney & Fels, 2008). For example, many North American adults closely associate the main shark theme from the movie "Jaws", a simple alternating pattern of the notes E and F, with images of an impending shark attack and the anticipation of doom, even if the music is not being used in the context of sharks (Berardinelli, 2002; Matessino, 1999, Sept. 24). The experience of entertainment and enjoyment is produced for hearing audiences which occupy the larger portion of society. For Deaf, Deafened, and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) people this experience of entertainment and enjoyment is limited. While it is true that the deaf community creates its own music (Fourney & Fels, 2009), people who are deaf experience barriers when attempting to access the music of the larger hearing culture. They do not have access to this shared experience because it is not provided in a modality that is more appropriate to this population of consumers. Existing strategies for deaf people to access this auditory information include putting one's hands on speakers or setting the volume loud enough to create a moderate tactile effect from the air pressure or floor vibration. People who are hard of hearing experience different barriers when attempting to access the music of the larger hearing culture. Their residual hearing may not allow the individual to hear the full range of tones or perceive sound in stereo. Existing strategies for hard of hearing people to access this auditory information include amplification, making the music loud enough to hear but losing the clarity of the sound, or selecting specific genre based on their accessibility (e.g., lack of lyrics). Music is often described as an aural experience; it has to be heard to be enjoyed. Until the development of the first practical sound recording and reproduction device, Edison's phonograph, in the late nineteenth century, the experience of music was primarily live. Live performance provides an opportunity for an experience that goes beyond the auditory. It is an emerging social experience. Within live performance the three phases of music, its creation, transmission, and reception, are couched in a larger social space. The music is on the one hand part of the social space and feeding the social experience, while on the other hand (simultaneously) the reason for the social experience. People come together to perform the music and/or to experience the performance of the music. Within the shared experience people talk about the music and individually as well as collectively respond to the music. In the live environment exists a chance for more senses to be stimulated. The music experience might be felt, seen, tasted, or smelled. Tactile and visual components of live music that can enhance or complement the overall music experience include feeling vibrations such as the drum beat, or watching the movements of the performers (band members, instrumentalists, vocalists) or dance accompaniment. The sense of taste and smell are impacted by the presence of food and drink in the concert space. The phonograph's ability to record and reproduce the aural portion of such live performances removed this additional social, tactile, olfactory, and visual information from the experience and changed the focus of musical entertainment. Without the visual, tactile, social and other experi2

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. UNIVERSAL USABILITY

ences of live performance to provide any non-auditory information, music is mostly an auditory experience. When (artificially) focused only on this aural component, music becomes mostly invisible to those who cannot hear it. This aural focus excludes D/HH people from participation. Music videos have returned some of the visual, or visible, elements of live performances but they are not intended to increase the accessibility or reprise the social experience of the music. Music videos may be more oriented to marketing the product or boosting the "image" of the artist (Straw, 1988) than visually conveying the artist's own interpretation of the music. For me, as a hard of hearing person, one of the challenges of this research is to derive an understanding of the concept of music. The literature regarding music or sound typically assumes that the reader can hear. Few authors make an attempt to explain music to those who cannot hear at all, cannot hear in stereo, or do not hear very well. By "music", this Dissertation does not mean music as presented on paper (i.e., a musical score), or held in memory, or words, or dance. Music is a process of expression by a performer, transmission via some medium, and reception / interpretation by a listener. While this Dissertation will tend to focus on that which is received or heard, all three elements of the music experience (performance, transmission, and reception) will be touched upon. One possible solution to creating access to this cultural information and entertainment medium is making the invisible properties of music visual, and therefore visible. For any prototype visualization of music to be successful, it needs to convey the sense of music, emotional content, and overall entertainment. The lyrics alone are not enough (Fourney & Fels, 2009). Ultimately, the experience should be similar to that enjoyed through sound except that the means of enjoyment would be different. If the song is intended to be soothing, it should be visually perceived as such. Of the greatest interest to me is whether meaningful and entertaining music visualization is feasible to meet the needs of D/HH music enthusiasts, and the extent to which it can be accomplished automatically without human intervention.

Universal Usability

The information and communications products and services design philosophy that ensures products are usable for every person is commonly referred to as universal usability, design for all, universal access, and universal design. Research in universal usability is needed to understand the challenges of technology variety, user diversity, and gaps in user knowledge (Shneiderman, 2000). Research in visualizing music for D/HH consumers, in particular, has to understand the gaps in user knowledge. Since many D/HH people already access music in some manner, understanding what information can already be perceived and what further information is still needed is a challenge. Any music visualization solution needs to be at least as usable and as accessible as the current solution, it cannot add new barriers. In addition, there is great user diversity. People who are D/HH access music with differing levels of success and enjoyment (Fourney & Fels, 2009). When listening to music, they encounter various barriers such as incomprehensible lyrics, too low volume, and flat tone. Some report no longer enjoy3

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

ing music as they once did prior to acquiring hearing loss (Fourney & Fels, 2009; Sacks, 2007). Others report seeing no point in music because they have never been able to hear it (Fourney & Fels, 2009). Thus, for D/HH audiences, music brings issues of usability and issues of accessibility. While one may be able to access the music to some degree, the information it contains may not be entirely usable. The concepts and practice of usability and accessibility may help to better understand these challenges and some of the roles they play in music visualization solutions and point to ways to address them.

1.1.1

Usability and Accessibility

Although closely related, the concepts of usability and accessibility are distinct. It is possible to create a usable product that is not accessible. Similarly, it is possible to create an accessible product that is not usable. To avoid either scenario, it is necessary to understand both concepts and their relationship to solution design. This section will define and discuss these concepts. International standards in the area of software ergonomics that include definitions of usability and accessibility have been developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The definition of usability in ISO 9241-11 is "the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use" (International Organization for Standardization [ISO], 1998, p. 2). The standard describes how to identify the information required when specifying or evaluating usability in terms of measures of user performance and satisfaction, and provides guidance on how to describe the context of use of the product and the measures of usability in an explicit way. It also includes an explanation of how the usability of a product can be specified and evaluated as part of a quality system (ISO, 1998). The three terms effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction refer respectively to how well the product does the job for the user, how easily1 the job is done for and by the user, and the user's freedom from discomfort as well as attitudes (positive or negative) towards the use of the system. In this context, the notions of effectiveness and efficiency are highly coupled. By definition, usability focuses on "specific users" and thus may ignore or exclude other users and issues of accessibility because these users are not specified as part of the user group. An example is music visualizations that are designed to entertain those who can already hear the music but do not support those who cannot also hear the music. Usability problems impact all users but to different extents; a given usability issue may impact one user more than another. A usability issue becomes an accessibility issue when it has a disproportionate effect on people with disabilities (G. C. Vanderheiden, personal communication, November 29, 2007). When accessibility is separated from usability, it is often perceived as a "special case" of usability where special designs are needed to fit the requirements of users with specific types of disability. This view suggests that specific users with specific disabilities should be required to purchase a significantly different (which may also translate into increased cost) version of common consumer products
1 In this context, "easy" refers to the "[r]esources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals." (ISO, 1998, p. 2)

1.1. UNIVERSAL USABILITY

which have been specially designed to meet their needs. This is not practical because each user group is so small that no product can be provided at reasonable cost to the consumer (or producer) (Vanderheiden, 1990). In addition, this approach does not meet the needs of the majority of consumers with disabilities because it excludes the widest possible range of users Â­ specific designs for specific groups of users with disabilities by definition miss other specific groups of users with disabilities (Fourney, 2007). Sometimes this "special case" perspective can lead designers to believe that everything needs to be designed to be used by everyone. This is based on a misperception that everything needs to be designed so that it is accessible to every possible person with a disability. It may be "impractical Â­ if not impossible Â­ to design everything so that it is accessible by everyone regardless of their limitations" (Vanderheiden, 1990, p. 388) and it may be "unreasonable to design everything to be usable by everyone" (Vanderheiden, 1990, p. 390). One solution is to take a middle ground: Products should be adaptable and compatible with assistive technologies. Design with the widest range of users in mind from the beginning, identifying which, if any, cannot be included. The goal of inclusive design is to keep the group of excluded users as small as possible. Some "special case" designs do exist. For example Braille, a system for representing text tactilely, was specifically designed for the blind. While it was not designed to reinvent the writing system for all possible users, Braille can be read by those who are trained in its use and have the ability to tactilely distinguish the characters. ISO 9241-171 is an international standard that provides requirements and recommendations for the design of systems and software that will enable users with disabilities greater accessibility to computer systems. Instead of treating accessibility separately from usability, it combines them. The ISO 9241171 definition of accessibility is "usability of a product, service, environment or facility by people with the widest range of capabilities" (International Organization for Standardization [ISO], 2008, p. 2). Accessibility then focuses on the widest range of users recognizing that different users have different needs and may require different accommodations. There are three views of how to create accessibility. Each view has a different focus: the user, the product, or the interaction between the user and the product (Carter & Fourney, 2004). A focus on the user forces the user to work around the accessibility of the product and corresponds to the biomedical and functional-rehabilitative models of disability; that is, that a disability is an "illness" to be "treated" or "fixed." The user seems to bear the "blame" for any problems. In this view, the "barrier" is perceived to somehow be an attribute of the user not the system or environment (e.g., Vitense, Jacko, and Emery (2002) refer to, "individuals with barriers limiting one or more channels of perception, such as a visual impairment", p. 76). In this view, meeting the needs of users and universal access is often seen as a burden rather than as a design goal. Accessibility is created by modifying the user. An example would be requiring a right-handed person to use a mouse designed for the lefthanded in their right hand. The issue is not that the right-handed person cannot use their left hand, but that it is awkward to do so, slow, and possibly uncomfortable. An extreme example would be the surgical modification of the user's body such as changing them so they can hear. The issue addressed here is not whether the D/HH person cannot hear, but that the information is not entirely accessible 5

1.1. UNIVERSAL USABILITY to them.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

A focus on the product forces the product / system to resolve accessibility problems. It shifts the focus onto the product / system and away from the user. The ISO 9241-171 definition of "accessibility" quoted above has the advantage of focusing the "problem" of accessibility on the usability of the system and away from the user, however, it continues to see human-computer interaction as a twoparty affair and still assigns blame to one of them (i.e., the product / system). Accessibility can be viewed as needing expensive or impractical changes to the system. Sometimes less expensive and more practical solutions are available. For example, Vanderheiden presents the case of users with disabilities not being able to get into an elevator before the door closes. The proposed solution was to simply extend the timer on the door. However, because many building codes require elevators to visit each floor in some set frequency, this solution required installing several more elevators. The eventual (and significantly cheaper) solution was to reprogram the elevator's controlling computer to announce its arrival before the door opened. Similarly, viewing music as the source of the entire problem and expecting music to resolve its usability and accessibility problems is impractical. This would require a complete re-engineering and reinvention of music (which is not an engineered product) to design accessibility for all possible audiences into it (Vanderheiden, 1990). A focus on the interaction between the user and the product recognizes that the problem of accessibility is neither the "fault" of the user nor the system. The focus is on, ". . . removing barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in substantial life activities. . . ." (Bergman & Johnson, 1995, p. 88). There is a third party involved, the "barrier" Â­ an interface which handicaps the interaction between the user and the system. This interaction can be described as a negotiation among parties where each party brings their own "terms" into the negotiation and a working partnership is sought (Carter & Fourney, 2004). Parties can only communicate if they have some shared context, which may include various types of knowledge and abilities. Anything missing in the shared context of the interaction is a barrier to the communication between the user and the product (Carter & Fourney, 2004). Applying this in the context of music would seem to indicate a better approach than focusing on the user or the product. Assisting the interaction between the music and the D/HH listener to find new paths to the information the listener cannot otherwise access is a potential source for solutions. One of the goals of this research is to create a means to increase the shared context available to D/HH music consumers. While it is not practical to reinvent music and choose a design where all the properties of music are accessible to all people, it may be reasonable to find a way to communicate a sufficient quantity of the properties of music to increase the communicative effect. At the same time, any solution to this problem will be a "special case" design because it focuses on the needs of a specific cultural / disabled population. The Principles of Universal Design provide some guidance on how to go about implementing inclusive or accessible designs that can be applied to this research. As proposed by the Center for Universal Design, the Principles of Universal Design are (Story, Mueller, & Mace, 1998): 1. Equitable use. The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. It is appeal6

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. UNIVERSAL USABILITY

ing to all users and provides the same or equivalent means of use for all users. 2. Flexibility in use. The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. It allows for choice in methods of use such as left- or right- handed use and adapts to the user's pace. 3. Simple and intuitive use. The use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. It is intuitive, minimizes complexity, and provides effective prompting and feedback. 4. Perceptible information. The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. It presents information in multiple redundant modalities and maximizes its legibility in each mode. 5. Tolerance for error. The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. It is fail-safe and provides warnings of hazards and errors. 6. Low physical effort. The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. It minimizes sustained physical effort and enables the user to maintain a neutral body position. 7. Size and space for approach and use. The design provides appropriate size and space for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility. It provides a clear line of sight and comfortable reach for any standing or seated user. Principle Four of the Principles of Universal Design, "Perceptible Information", is most relevant to this research. This principle requires the design to communicate necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. In particular, it encourages using different modalities (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile) to redundantly present essential information. For example, instead of presenting information only in an auditory manner, this principle would encourage visual presentation as well. It is this principle that guides the need for visual representations of auditory information, such as music, to support D/HH people. Other relevant principles are Principles Three and Five. Principle Three, "Simple and intuitive use", implies that the user interface of any visualization solution should be obvious. In the case of music visualization, this principle could also be interpreted to mean that the visualization itself should be simple and intuitive, even without sound. Principle Five, "Tolerance for error", essentially means any solution should be robust and the resulting visualization should not cause harm (e.g., improper red-flash can trigger seizures). Also relevant are Principles One and Two. Principle One, "Equitable use" suggests that, while a music visualization solution would, by definition, be inaccessible to people who are blind, it should not preclude other users. The solution should still enable users to listen to the music. According to this principle, any resulting visualization should also be appealing. Further, its user interface should allow for full use via keyboard. Principle Two, "Flexibility in use", implies that any solution should be 7

1.2. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

adaptable; designed with as many user options as necessary. For example, if a user wants to not hear any music, this should be possible. Other options might be colour choice, size on screen, or amount of information presented. The less relevant principles are Principles Six and Seven. Principle Six, "Low physical effort", is specific to issues of physical ergonomics such as work effort. Principle Seven, "Size and space for approach and use", is specific to issues of physical ergonomics such as body shape and size. Neither is relevant because music visualization for D/HH audiences is an issue more related to cognitive ergonomics such as perception. We have no control over any of the physical environment in which the visualization is used.

Research Objectives

Since, as noted earlier, of the greatest interest to me is whether meaningful and entertaining music visualization is feasible to meet the needs of D/HH music enthusiasts, and the extent to which it can be accomplished automatically without human intervention, the goals of this Dissertation are to: (a) define the needs of D/HH music enthusiasts; and (b) evaluate the feasibility of using music visualization as a substitute for auditory musical experience. While it is not practical to reinvent music and choose a design where all the properties of music are accessible to all people, it may be reasonable to find a way to communicate a sufficient quantity of the invisible properties of music in a visible way to increase the communicative effect. As a result, one of the areas of exploration in this Dissertation is the nature of music to identify its properties and its uses in hearing as well as D/HH cultures. Thus, at a high level the main research questions are: 1. What are the fundamental properties of music that a visualization must present and that produces an entertaining and meaningful experience for D/HH people? This will require an exploration of the atomic components of music and how these elements of music influence the entertainment of its listeners. This research question is consistent with Principle Four of the Principles of Universal Design, "Perceptible Information", because of the principle's requirement for communication of information. 2. What are the emotional experiences and interpretations of users from visualizations? Logically, just as aural music is interpretable by the listener, a visualization of music should be interpretable by the viewer. Ideally, if listeners can construct an emotional experience from the music information they hear, viewers of music visualizations should be able to construct some emotional experience from the information that they see. What kind of emotional experience viewers might have is currently unknown. Whether that emotional experience is the same as that of the hearing listener or even the same as that intended by the music creator is beyond 8

the scope of this work. This research question is consistent with several of the Principles of Universal Design such as Principle Three, "Simple and intuitive use", which implies that the user interface of any visualization solution should be obvious. 3. Is it possible to create a D/HH music experience similar to hearing audiences? While the previous question addresses what information D/HH users might receive via visualizations of music, this question addresses the issue of equity. Should D/HH people even expect a "similar" experience? If so, what is a "similar" experience? Of the Principles of Universal Design, Principle One "Equitable use", is particularly relevant here because it implies that the music itself, not just the visualization, should be equitable across users regardless of ability.

Background
Before the research objectives of this Dissertation can be further explored, it is necessary to better understand the existing knowledge on music, the D/HH communities, and the various ways different types of music information have been presented. The purpose of this chapter is to provide background information to these areas, show how past research relates to the current research questions, and explore open issues where the current research questions may provide more information.

2.1

The Audience

Hearing loss is considered one of the most common forms of disability around the world. In North America, hearing loss is the third most chronic disability among older adults and the fastest growing hidden disability. Although such statistics are difficult to gather and likely suffer from under-reporting, it is estimated that: Â· 10% of the global population has a mild or worse hearing loss (World Health Organization et al., 2001) and 360 million people (i.e., 5.3% of the population) are thought to have a moderate (40dB) or worse hearing loss (World Health Organization [WHO], 2013). Â· Between 1 in 8 and 1 in 22 Canadians are D/HH. That is, there are approximately 310,000 d/Deaf and deafened Canadians and possibly 2.8 million Hard of Hearing (HH) Canadians (Canadian Association of the Deaf [CAD], 2007, May 26). A Canadian Hearing Society survey found about 25% of adult Canadians report having some hearing loss (Canadian Hearing Society [CHS], 2002), while an analysis of responses to the Canada Community Health Survey found about 4.02% of respondents were thought to have hearing problems (Woodcock & Pole, 2007).
1 As needed, this Dissertation will follow the established convention of using the upper- or lower-case letter d/D to classify the status of d/Deaf people. "Deaf" people are those who identify themselves as members of the signing Deaf community and regard themselves as culturally Deaf, whereas "deaf" people are those who do not sign and regard themselves as having a significant hearing loss (Woodward, 1972).

2.1. THE AUDIENCE

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

Â· About 1 in 20 Americans are D/HH. That is, about 1 million Americans are functionally deaf and nearly 10 million are HH. More than half of all D/HH Americans are 65 years or older and less than 4% are under 18 years of age (Mitchell, 2006). Â· 16% of adult Europeans or about 71 million European adults aged 18 to 80 years have a hearing loss greater than 25dB (Hearit, 2006) There are three types of hearing loss: conductive, sensorineural, and mixed. In a conductive hearing loss, sound is blocked or cannot get into the ear as the result of excess earwax, colds, injuries to the ear (e.g., loss of pinnae), etc. A sensorineural hearing loss occurs where sounds can get into and travel through the ear, but a person cannot perceive the sound as a result of an issue with the cochlea or auditory nerve. A mixed hearing loss occurs where a person has both conductive and sensorineural loss. A hearing loss can be bilateral (i.e., in both ears) or unilateral (i.e., one ear). Typically, people with a bilateral hearing loss have an unequal hearing loss and will describe one ear as their "better" ear (e.g., a person with a bilateral hearing loss can have some hearing in one ear and no hearing in the other, or hear in both ears to different degrees). Unilateral hearing loss, also called "single-sided deafness" occurs where a person has a hearing loss in only one ear. While people can experience a hearing loss in specific frequencies, typically a person experiences a loss of a range of frequencies. High frequency hearing loss is the most common and occurs especially among seniors. Human speech is transmitted in the high frequencies. Although vowel sounds are below this range, certain consonant sounds have primary frequencies above 3000Hz. While there is variation among individuals, persons with high frequency hearing loss can have difficulty hearing the distinction between English sibilants such as the `f ', `s ', `th ', `ch ' and `sh ' sounds and may not distinguish unvoiced consonants like `k ' and `t '. Words that begin or end with these sounds can be difficult to hear. The result is that phrases such as "chase the cat" and "shake the sack" sound alike (S. Fox, 2015). Low frequency or "reverse slope" hearing loss occurs where a person cannot hear sounds in frequencies below 2000Hz. Since speech information resides in high and mid-range frequencies, a low frequency hearing loss is "symptom free" and harder to identify. There are many causes of hearing loss. For example (WHO, 2013): 1. genetics; 2. illness (e.g., certain infectious diseases, chronic ear infections, etc.); 3. particular drugs are known to be "ototoxic" (e.g., antibiotics such as gentamicin, loop diuretics such as furosemide, platinum-based chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin, large doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as acetylsalicylic acid (i.e., aspirin) (Wikipedia, 2015c)); 4. age-related (e.g., presbycusis, calcification of bones, etc.) hearing loss can start as early as 18 years of age; 12

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.1. THE AUDIENCE

5. noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by one-time exposure to an intense "impulse" sound (e.g., explosion, firearm), or continuous exposure to loud sounds over an extended period of time (e.g., noise generated in a woodworking shop, iPods, etc.); 6. injury to the ear or head 7. etc. While some of these causes (e.g., noise induced hearing loss) can result in hearing losses in specific narrow frequency ranges, other causes can have wider impacts on hearing. It should also be noted that a hearing loss can be sudden (a noticeable permanent loss) or progressive (variable increasing levels of permanent hearing loss experienced slowly, possibly imperceptibly, over years or decades). This can impact a person's experience of their hearing loss, their ability to cope, and their overall attitude towards it (Woodcock & Aguayo, 2000). The number of people with hearing loss is likely to grow for two reasons: Â· First, as average lifespans gradually increase and the number of people over 60 gets larger, the number of people with age-related hearing loss will grow. According to United Nations global population projections, almost 1 in 10 people are over 60 years old and by 2050, it is estimated that 1 in 5 people will be over 60. Globally, people aged over 60 are expected to outnumber children aged 0-14 by 2050. In developed countries this is expected to occur much sooner, for example, in Canada it is estimated that by 2015 the number of older adults will exceed the number of children (UN, 2011). A recent survey shows 46% of Canadians aged 45 to 87 have a hearing loss (CHS, 2002). Â· Second, as people increasingly expose themselves to loud noise, the number of people with noiseinduced hearing loss will likely grow. Continuous exposure to loud noise can damage the structure of hair cells in the cochlea, resulting in hearing loss and tinnitus. In Ontario, the current maximum noise exposure is 85dB per 8 hour work day (Ministry of Labour, 2007). In the United States, the current recommended maximum noise exposure is 85dB per 8 hour work day or less than 15 minutes of 100dB exposure per work day (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH], 1998). Given that a 5th generation iPod Touch has a 40 hour battery life and is capable of volumes as high as 115dB, music can be played longer and louder.

Disability

Populations that are perceived to be "disabled" can be defined / described in multiple ways. Definitions that focus on the individual as the unit of analysis tend to centre on either a bio-medical model with emphasis on the attributes of the individual, or on a functional-rehabilitative model with emphasis on the promotion or restoration of fuller functioning in the individual. Such definitions frame disability with reference to the individual and in terms of individual deficits. Most of the models in

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

this category assume a "norm," below which a person should fall if she or he is identified as a person with a disability. Medical definitions have the view that the aetiology of disability resides in the individual as a consequence of events such as disease, accident, war, genetic structure, birth trauma, or other acute causes and that by identifying the aetiology involved, disability can be "treated", "cured", or "prevented". The functional-rehabilitative approach has the view that emphasizes the actions or activities that an individual can perform (with or without assistance) as a result of a bio-medical condition (Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission, 1999). Definitions that focus on the society as the unit of analysis tend to centre either on an environmental model with attention directed to ecological barriers (social, economic, political, institutional and legal) which can result in disability, or a human rights model with emphasis on the rights to which all people, including those with disabilities, are entitled. Such definitions focus not on the individual but on the social, economic, political, institutional and legal conditions that can result in disability. Environmental definitions recognize that a physical, sensory or intellectual disability will not limit many individuals as much as being denied an education, the right to employment, or the right to marry and have a family of their own. Human rights approaches to disability are premised on the recognition of a set of fundamental rights to which all people are entitled regardless of one's individual characteristics, consequently reducing the need for a specific definition of disability (Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission, 1999). While a medical model view of disability ignores the imperfection and deficiencies of the environment (United Nations Commission for Social Development on Disability, 1993), definitions with a focus on society recognize that, "disability has too long been viewed as a problem of the individual and not the relationship between an individual and his/her environment" (Disabled Peoples' International [DPI], 1993). Thus, unlike definitions that focus on an individual's deficits, definitions that focus on society require that the structural conditions in a society that result in disability be addressed and ameliorated. Just because one is perceived to have a disability in one society does not necessarily mean one is also perceived to have a disability (or even the same disability) in another. For example, the island of Martha's Vineyard once had a strain of hereditary deafness such that a large number of residents were born deaf. As a result, most people on the island knew at least one person who was deaf and a large number of islanders were fluent in the local Sign Language. At a time when mainland United States did not allow deaf persons to hold office, much less vote, there was little social differentiation based on hearing status on Martha's Vineyard (Groce, 1985). Table 2.1 summarizes some of the ways D/HH populations are described / defined by others as well as themselves. The difference between those who describe themselves as Deaf and those who describe themselves as Hard of Hearing is probably best captured in the cultural definition; the one group is a linguistic minority with their own language, while the other is a distinct subculture within a spoken language community. Not well understood from the ideas presented in Table 2.1 are the concerns of these populations with respect to music. In addition, there is significant mixing among the populations of people with hearing loss. For 14

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND Definition Medical / Audiological Functional Hard of Hearing A person with a severe or better hearing loss (HL). A person who gets meaningful information from sound (possibly only when it is amplified). A person with a HL who prefers to use an oral language as their primary form of communication. A person who identifies themselves with the Hard of Hearing community or as a member of a social group of HH people.

2.1. THE AUDIENCE Deaf A person with a severe to profound hearing loss (85+ dB). A person who typically cannot get meaningful information from sound (even if it is amplified). A person with a HL who prefers to use a sign language as their primary form of communication. A person who identifies themselves with the Deaf community (such a person may not have any hearing loss).

Legal

Cultural

Table 2.1: Medical, functional, legal, and cultural definitions of "Deaf" and "Hard of Hearing". example, some people who would fit the medical definition of a deaf person are functionally hard of hearing. Some HH people are members of the signing Deaf community. This mixing can confound research results that rely on poorly defined group differences. From a design perspective it is vital to understand that these are distinct groups with very specific user needs. Deaf People who are deaf are not able to hear and/or unable to make meaning of anything they might perceive as sound. Hearing is a specialization of the sense of touch. The two senses share a common genetic basis (Frenzel et al., 2012). Both deal with force. Both rely on mechanosensation. Physiologically, touch and hearing both convert mechanical stimuli into neuronal signals: cutaneous mechanoreceptors are responsible for touch while inner ear hair cells are responsible for hearing. Ultimately, a common physicochemical basis likely determines how channel proteins sense force (Kung, 2005). Since hearing, is a specialization of the sense of touch, people who are deaf can feel sound travelling through the ear canal (e.g., as a tickling sensation as the hairs in the canal are moved) but may have no associated meaning to the sensation. People who are born deaf are very sensitive to vibration and can feel loud noise as the sound wave vibrates their body. Thus people who are born deaf tend to have a limited music experience in the auditory sense. The full range of musical sounds in recorded music is simply not accessible to them. Presumably, this would mean that people who are born deaf have a limited psychological reality to auditory music. Chapter 4 will explore some reasons why this may not be so.

2.2. THE NATURE OF MUSIC Hard of Hearing

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

People who are born hard of hearing (HH) tend to have some limited ability to hear music. Depending on the degree of hearing loss, whether the loss is mostly high frequency or low frequency, and if the hearing loss is bilateral (i.e., both ears) or one-sided, HH people experience different barriers when attempting to access the music of the larger hearing culture. The full range of musical sounds in recorded music is somewhat accessible to this population. Since their residual hearing may not allow the individual to hear the full range of tones or perceive sound in stereo, for many D/HH music consumers different parts of music are missing / muffled. In fact many D/HH people may choose to listen to music that fits within their ability to hear it either with or without amplification. This may mean that, whatever music experience a D/HH person has could be skewed since amplifying any sound can distort it. (Chapter 4 will explore this population more fully.) Deafened People who are born hearing and later experience a loss of their hearing may refer to themselves as deafened. Because a hearing person would potentially have a life experience with music and potentially develop a psychological reality of music, the experience of hearing loss does not mean that the knowledge of music is lost only that the ability to hear it is lost. The memory of music remains. The ability to form new memories such as by experiencing new songs is lost. Chapter 4 will explore this population more fully.

2.2

The Nature of Music

Music has different meanings to different people and cultures, including D/HH culture, and is expressed in different ways. The literature regarding performed music or sound typically assumes that the reader can hear. Few authors make an attempt to explain music to those who cannot hear or do not hear very well. As a result, many of the definitions of music and its properties use auditory-based terminology. This section will attempt to provide definitions of the various aspects of music and explain the principle components in sound-independent ways. Various dictionaries have very different definitions of music. Webster's International Dictionary defines music as (Gove et al., 2002, p. 1490): Â· "the science or art of incorporating pleasing, expressive, or intelligible combinations of vocal or instrumental tones into a composition having definite structure and continuity" Â· "vocal or instrumental sounds having rhythm, melody, or harmony" Â· "an agreeable sound" The Random House Dictionary of the English Language defines music as (Flexner & Hauck, 1987, p. 1268):

16

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.2. THE NATURE OF MUSIC

Â· "an art of sound in time that expresses ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, and color." Â· "the tones or sounds employed, occurring in single line (melody) or multiple lines (harmony), and sounded or to be sounded by one or more voices or instruments, or both." Â· "any sweet, pleasing, or harmonious sounds or sound: the music of the waves." The third edition of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines music as (Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries, 1992, p. 1190): Â· "The art of arranging sounds in time so as to produce a continuous, unified, and evocative composition, as through melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre." Â· "Vocal or instrumental sounds possessing a degree of melody, harmony, or rhythm." Â· "An aesthetically pleasing or harmonious sound or combination of sounds: the music of the wind." The 1913 edition of Webster's notes, "Not all sounds are tones. Sounds may be unmusical and yet please the ear. Music deals with tones, and with no other sounds." (Porter, 1913, p. 956). In summary, music involves an ordering of tones. It has an aesthetic quality that is pleasing to those who can hear it. It is a science and an art. The definition from Random House suggests that music "expresses ideas and emotions", thus music is a means of communication. Levitin notes that, when listening to music, we hear multiple attributes of music at once. He lists tone, pitch, timbre, loudness, tempo, rhythm, contour, spatial location, and reverberation as the "fundamental building blocks" (Levitin, 2007, p. 14) of performed music. The first eight of these perceptual attributes can be varied independently (Levitin & Tirovolas, 2009). All nine are the primitives upon which all other properties of music are built. Â· A tone is a discrete musical sound. A note is something written on a score. While both terms appear to refer to the same thing, the former is heard while the latter is seen (Levitin, 2007). Â· Pitch is the psychological construct people use when thinking about tones. While it is related to the actual frequency of the sound wave of a tone, it is not equivalent because while frequency is an objective, scientific concept, pitch is subjective. When we double or halve a frequency, we end up with a note that sounds remarkably similar to the one we started out with. This relationship, a frequency ratio of 2:1 or 1:2, is called the "octave." (Levitin, 2007, p. 29) For example, if the A above middle C is 440Hz, the A an octave above that is 880Hz. Pitch is what gives listeners the sense of a tone's relative position in the musical scale (higher or lower). "Pitch is one of the primary means by which musical emotion is conveyed" (Levitin, 2007, p. 26). For example, a high note can convey excitement, a low note can convey sadness, and a series of notes creates a more powerful, nuanced melody. Pitch is so important that the brain represents it directly; unlike almost any other musical attribute. The auditory cortex has a "tonotopic" map, with low to high tones stretched out across 17

2.2. THE NATURE OF MUSIC

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

the cortical surface. In this sense, the brain contains a "map" of different pitches, and different areas of the brain respond to different pitches (Levitin, 2007, p. 27). Â· Timbre (sometimes called "colour") is that quality that allows a listener to easily distinguish between the sounds of different instruments even when they play "the same note, for the same length of time, at the same loudness" (Schmidt-Jones, 2013). "A listener can hear not only the difference between an oboe and a flute, but also the difference between two different oboes." (SchmidtJones, 2013). Font faces provide a non-sound analogy to timbre. The same character can be represented in different fonts (e.g., Times Roman, Arial, etc.), a `B' is still a `B', but the personality of the font can be easily perceived. With experience, one can name different font faces. The definition of music from Random House suggests that music has "color". There is no mention of whether this is a reference to a form of synesthesia (e.g., see Cytowic, 2002) or to timbre. Schmidt-Jones' (2013) description of timbre as a property of music implies that music has qualities such as loudness and length, as well as pitch. It also raises questions about what is important to the listener (e.g., Can the listener distinguish between two different oboes? Does the listener want to distinguish between two different oboes?). Â· Loudness is a psychological construct that relates to the physical amplitude of the tone (Levitin, 2007). The intensity level of a sound can be objectively measured and expressed in the deciBel (dB) scale. Conversely, the loudness of a sound is subjective and varies from person to person. Sounds with equal intensities but different frequencies are perceived by the same person to have unequal loudness. The non-SI unit phon is used to indicate an individual's perception of loudness Â· Tempo is the overall pace or speed of the piece (Levitin, 2007). Â· Rhythm is the way that the durations of a group of notes fit together into larger units (Levitin, 2007). For example, visually, rhythm appears in a musical score using different notes (e.g., whole, quarter, etc.) to denote their individual durations. Grouping them together and grouping these groups is what leads to rhythm. For example, Ballroom and Latin dance are visual expressions of rhythm, the dancer's feet and body act out the rhythm. Â· Contour describes the overall shape of the music, the up and down of the melodies. It describes whether a note goes up or down, not the amount of change (Levitin, 2007). It is the most identifying attribute of music (Dowling, 1999). Visually, contour might be thought of as curves the written notes make on a piece of sheet music. Â· Spatial location is the source of the sound in three dimensional space. Human stereo hearing is very sensitive to position in the left-right plane and somewhat sensitive in the forward-back plane. Humans are not very sensitive to location in the up-down plane (Levitin, 2007). People try to mimic spatial location through the use of stereo headsets and surround sound entertainment systems. 18

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.2. THE NATURE OF MUSIC

Â· Reverberation (or "reverb") is the sense of how far the source of the sound is (or appears to be) combined with the size of the room the music is in. Reverberation, "has an underappreciated role in communicating emotion and creating an overall pleasing sound" (Levitin, 2007, p. 16). As sound bounces off objects and surfaces around the listener, it builds up the experience. It is for this reason that poorly designed concert halls might reduce a sound such that the listener cannot hear anything or cannot perceive a stereo effect (Sacks, 2007). For example, when clapping one's hands in a small room full of furniture and heavy curtains, the sound dies away almost immediately and the room is said to be acoustically "dead", but when clapping one's hands in a large room with hard walls, the sound bounces back and forth off the walls several times before the sound dies away and the room is described as "lively." Thus, musicians sound better in a "live" room than a "dead" one (Powell, 2010, p. 231). People try to mimic reverberation through the use of stereo headsets and surround sound entertainment systems. Schroeder describes proper reverberation as "colourless", it does not sound like "rain on a tin roof" (Schroeder, 1992, p. 42), and free of unwanted flutter, a pistol shot sounds like a single decaying shot, not like a machine gun burst. A visual analogy of good reverberation would be a circle, bubble or other icon, slowly, smoothly, and evenly shrinking or fading out. A visual analogy to this experience of a sense of space can be experienced in rooms that have large mirrors on opposite walls (Shepard & Levitin, 2002). Reverberation should not be confused with Echo. Although one may enjoy the effect of sounds lasting longer because they are bouncing around the room, the goal is that all the bounced sound from each note overlaps so that it reaches one's ears as a single, long note. If the walls of the room are too far apart, the time between bounces will be too long and the experience will not be a single, extended note. Instead one will hear the note, then a gap, then the note again. This effect is "echo." Concert hall designers live in the hope that their designs will give the audience lots of pleasant reverberation, but no echoes (Powell, 2010, p. 231). According to Levitin, these attributes are separable; varying one will not alter the others. Although the production of music can be broken down into these attributes, how the perceptual and cognitive system processes the signals representing these attributes to be meaningful is complex and influenced by cultural factors. The brain organizes these musical attributes into higher level concepts such as metre, key, harmony, and melody (Dowling, 1999; Levitin, 2007; Weinberger, 1999): Â· Metre, in which tones are grouped with one another across time, is created through a combination of loudness and rhythm cues. Â· Key is a culturally defined hierarchy of importance between tones in a musical piece. Â· Harmony, in its most basic form, is a parallel melody to the primary one. It is the relationship between the pitches of different tones.

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.2. THE NATURE OF MUSIC

causes movement of the stapes. The stapes ends at the oval window converting the mechanical vibration into vibration of liquid. The inner ear, or cochlea, is the organ of hearing. As the footplate of the stapes presses into the oval window of the cochlea, the fluid inside of the latter is moved, flowing against the receptor cells (i.e., hair cells). As these receptors fire, they stimulate the spiral ganglion, which sends information through the auditory portion of the eighth cranial nerve to the brain. The inner ear also contains the vestibular system, which is beyond the scope of this paper. Once the perceptual system processes the external sound data, the cognitive system is required to make it meaningful. Music derives from three human cognitive abilities: theory of mind, recursion, and abstract representation (Levitin & Tirovolas, 2009). Theory of mind refers to the human ability to attribute mental state to oneself and others. Cultural experience (through performance, education, observation and/or training) and innate abilities (such as a sense of rhythm) contribute to the theory of mind states for music. Recursion is the ability to repeat themes and create variations on themes. Music is thematic and often repetitious, as the human mind is exposed to this over time, recursive elements are established in the cognitive system. Abstract representation is the ability to construct meaning and interpretation from various signals that enter the brain through the perceptual systems. Combined with cultural experiences, learning, recursion properties and practice, the human mind can draw connections between perceived auditory signals and emotion, entertainment, and other interpretations of music. Research in the cognitive mechanisms relating to perception provides evidence for auditory analogues to visual perception. For example, the size constancy of vision and the loudness constancy of audition are analogous. Size constancy is based on the idea that while objects on the retina expand and contract as the object moves closer and farther away, objects in the real world are of constant size. One can perceive an object, as it is, independently of its distance. Similarly, as the amplitude of a sound changes, its source may be perceived as closer or farther away. Accompanying changes in timbre (i.e., the musician's changing effort will influence the higher-frequency components of the sound), help the listener determine whether the change in amplitude is due to changing distance or a simple decrease in amplitude (Shepard & Levitin, 2002). Another example can be seen in perceptual completion. When visually presented with a shape interrupted with white spaces, the closure effect automatically completes the shape in one's mind. A similar effect can be seen auditorially, when a sinusoidal sound is replaced by bursts of white noise, the effect on the listener is a smoothly sweeping sinusoidal sound covered up by noise bursts. There is a similar effect when music is used in place of sinusoidal sound (Shepard & Levitin, 2002). Understanding how these and other cognitive and perceptual systems contribute to musical processing may help in developing visualizations of music. The result of combining the higher order properties of music (e.g., metre), which themselves resulted from the combination of the primitives of music, has an aesthetically pleasing effect. (Levitin, 2007) does not mention the aesthetics as a noteworthy property of music, however, I suggest that it is important because it affects the entertainment value of music. The dictionary definitions also define music as having "an agreeable sound" (Gove et al., 2002, p. 1490). Put simply, we perceive cer21

2.2. THE NATURE OF MUSIC

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

tain note progressions as "pleasant", while others we perceive as "unpleasant" or "wrong". In the same way, certain groups of notes (i.e., chords) sound more pleasant than others. As highlighted in the song "Four Chords" by The Axis of Awesome, it is for this reason that formulaic instrumentation (Percino, Klimek, & Thurner, 2014) and the so-called "pop-punk chord progression" 3 is seen in many contemporary pop and rock songs (Murphy, 2014; Wikipedia, 2015b). This suggests a property of music is agreeableness: Â· Agreeableness is the aesthetic qualities of music that make it enjoyable and pleasing. Another property that is often assumed when discussing music is the notion of binaural hearing that can take advantage of stereo sound. Assuming a person has two working ears, binaural hearing is ability to use the information provided by the differences between one's two ears (Colburn, ShinnCunningham, Kidd, & Durlach, 2006). In particular, binaural hearing provides the listener with localization of sound (i.e., the subjective sense of the location of a sound source based on interaural temporal and intensity differences) and summation for enhanced loudness (i.e., the subjective experience of loudness of a sound presented simultaneously to both ears is approximately double that presented to one ear) (Welsh, Welsh, Rosen, & Dragonette, 2004). Sacks remarks that, until one experiences single-sided deafness, "We tend to take our stereo world for granted" (Sacks, 2007, p. 146). He argues that people who cannot hear in stereo miss the qualities of "rotundity", "spaciousness, voluminousness, richness, [and] resonance" (Sacks, 2007, p. 144). Each of these terms refer to the way that sound can fill a space; its fullness. For example, "richness" refers to sound being full and mellow in tone. From these properties, a listener can sense the depth and distance of music. Without them, music becomes "flat". The ability to hear in stereo provides another avenue of emotional content through the fullness of music and effects such as reverberation. There are numerous properties and qualities of music, some of which rely on combinations of two or more lower level or primitive properties (e.g., metre). What is less obvious is which properties are most important to the overall experience and enjoyment of music and whether there is a set of primitive properties that can be used to describe all other properties. Identifying a set of important primitive properties would provide a strong foundation for and the necessary building blocks to develop an approach to visualizing music that focuses on these properties. Determining those primitives which can be used to describe the other properties also creates the possibility that the visualizations of such primitive properties could be combined to create higher level properties. Composers use these properties in creative ways to create music that fits the desired mood they want to express in the hopes the audience interprets the same mood. The effect that music has on people can be multidimensional. People listening to music experience emotion, entertainment, pleasure, or a welcome distraction.
progression is specifically a cadence of the tonic, dominant, submediant, and subdominant cords, or I-V-vi-IV in Roman Numeral notation. For example, in the key of C major, this would be: C--G--Am--F.

2.3. THE NATURE OF EMOTION

2.3

The Nature of Emotion

Various psychological models exist for describing emotions. They include, the PAD (pleasureÂ­displeasure, arousalÂ­nonarousal, and dominanceÂ­submissiveness) model (Mehrabian, 1996), and the models of basic emotions (Ekman, 1999; Plutchik, 1980; Sauter, Eisner, Ekman, & Scott, 2010). The PAD model of emotion is a dimensional model that attempts to decompose emotions into three orthogonal underlying dimensions: Pleasure (or valence), the degree of pleasantness of the emotional experience; Arousal, the level of activation of the emotion; and Dominance, the level of attention or rejection of the emotion (Mehrabian, 1996; J. A. Russell & Mehrabian, 1977). Each element has opposing dimensions (pleasure / displeasure, arousal / sleep, and dominance / submission) and forms one axis with opposing end points of a three-axes model. Emotional responses can be plotted along each of these axes. This model is complex to use as it requires the dissection of emotional responses into three separate categories. While commonly used in marketing research to understand the role of dominance-submissiveness in consumer behaviour (Yani-de Soriano & Foxall, 2006), the PAD model has been used in HCI research (e.g., Lottridge, 2008). The psychological models of basic emotion proposed by Plutchik (1980) and Ekman (1999) suggest that emotions are analogs to colours on a colour wheel, such that there are "primary emotions" from which all other emotions are derived. They suggest that there exists a set of five to eight primitive emotions. Plutchik's eight emotion model includes acceptance, anger, anticipation, disgust, joy, fear, sadness, and surprise (1980). The five emotion model of Ekman and Friesen, which is based on crosscultural facial expressions research, includes anger, happiness, sadness, fear, and surprise (1986). In a review of a dozen different lists of basic emotions and their biological bases, Ortony and Turner (1990) found, "that there is no coherent nontrivial notion of basic emotions" (1990, p. 315); however, they suggested that there are "basic elements" (1990, p. 329), which are not themselves emotions, out of which different emotions are built. H. Smith and Schneider also found no support for the universality of these models of emotion or the emotion wheel theory and further argues that Ekman's model is, "impossible to replicate. . . without introducing pretest training and forced-choice formats" (H. Smith & Schneider, 2009, p. 583). Regardless of their controversy, these models have been used to develop a model for formulating emotive captions that combine graphics and text to represent emotion and sound effects and test them with D/HH audiences (e.g., Lee, Fels, & Udo, 2007).

2.4

Music and Emotion

Emotion is one important outcome of music; it affects people's feelings. For example, Toland describes, "the excitement, the rush, the indescribable thrill that moves me to turn up the volume, sing along with the melody or tell everyone in the room to shut the hell up so I can listen." Others use music as a background experience to cover up (or as a distraction from) the hum of the refrigerator (Toland, 2001), mask tinnitus (Fourney & Fels, 2009), or, in the case of early silent movies, drown out the noise of clanking projectors (Cavalcanti, 1939). Still others draw on music for entertainment, as a form of escape, or to fill time. 23

2.4. MUSIC AND EMOTION

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

CsÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi (1990) has found that the performance of music can create for the performer a state of mind which he calls "flow". Flow is, "the state of mind we enter when completely involved in making music, doing sports, or whenever we are focused on any challenging and enjoyable activity" (CsÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi, 2004, p. 341). For D/HH people, the emotional element of music may be unknown to them. Darrow explored the ability of deaf people to perceive emotion in music and reported that, "When the instructions for the music listening task were given to the Deaf participants, many were amused at the idea of determining the emotion of the music. Asking them to emotionally interpret music was obviously a novel concept to them." (Darrow, 2006, p. 11) Suggesting some D/HH people are not aware that there is an emotional component to music, while others are. In addition, for some D/HH people, the emotional experience may include the frustration of inaccessible information in the music.

2.4.1

Emotion Conventions in Music

Although it is well-known that listeners make associations between music and emotion, it is not known how much of this experience is innate and how much is learned through cultural interpretation (Darrow, 2006). While culture may play a role in judgments of emotion in music, compositional dimensions of music, such as tempo, rhythm, texture, timbre, and pitch, also influence the listener's perception of emotion in music and may serve as universal cues for the emotional assessment of music (Darrow, 2006). Certain emotional associations with music may have been culturally conventionalized. For example in Western music, Darrow (2006) suggests: Â· major mode is associated with happy, minor mode with sad, Â· loud music is associated with animated or happy, soft music with delicate or peaceful, Â· even-valued rhythms are seen as serious, uneven-valued rhythms as playful or happy, and Â· staccato articulation is seen as lively or energetic, legato articulation is seen as peaceful or gentle. The approach of looking for music conventions has been the basis of work by various authors. For example, Cooke analyzed elements of musical expression to establish a lexicon of the specific emotions these elements were able to convey. He attempted to test this theory empirically and took as his material Western tonal music composed since the 15th century. He identified several musical patterns that were commonly used to express specific emotions in this set of music (Cooke, 1959). However, efforts to substantiate his theory empirically have been unsuccessful (Balkwill & Thompson, 1999). Kivy (1980) also theorized that certain melodic patterns are conventionally associated with specifiable expressive predicates, such as "is sad," "is angry," or "is joyful". However, he acknowledged that some links between music and emotion may be "natural." Conventions that Kivy identified as being typical of Western classical music included falling melodic lines signifying sadness, leaping melodic motion signifying joy, and slow tempo with measured rhythm signifying dignity. 24

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.4. MUSIC AND EMOTION

Western listeners are able to perceive emotional expressiveness in the music of an unfamiliar tonal system and evidence suggests that this ability is based on psychophysical elements such as tempo, timbre, and complexity rather than musical experience, knowledge, or enculturation (Balkwill & Thompson, 1999). These associations are important because they provide some direction in determining the presence of emotion in music and eventually expressing emotion through music visualization. With respect to determining the presence of emotion in music, an automated analysis of the musical piece could be used to find these attributes and identify them for translation into a visualization (e.g., Kim et al., 2010). With respect to visualizing the emotion of music, it might be possible to map these types of associations to equivalents in the visual domain. For example, the loudness of the music could be translated into quickness of the animation. If loud music is animated or happy, then a more animated faster moving visualization might be able to communicate happiness. Conversely, if soft music is perceived as quieter, then a slower, more subtle animation might be able to communicate sadness. Another possibility is to express staccato articulation through a series of rapid flashes while legato articulation could be expressed through flashes with much longer durations. These musical conventions and other psychophysical elements are used in film and television entertainment to provide the emotional atmosphere. It may be useful to briefly examine how music is used in film entertainment and how it reflects the use of these emotional associations to enhance the visual experience.

2.4.2

Emotion Conventions in Music in Film

While the earliest films did not have a soundtrack, they were by no means "silent". Live sound accompaniment (e.g., live piano) was used from the beginning to give viewers a sense of being part of the scene. In the early 20th century, films were accompanied by phonographs. As films got longer, film showmen would employ barkers to provide commentary and attempt synchronized speech. With the opening of the first cinemas, intertitles, printed dialogue or narration shown between scenes, were introduced to explain the action and dialogue while music would be used as an accompaniment (Cavalcanti, 1939). Figure 2.2 shows an intertitle from the comedy short All on Account of a Transfer (Williams, 1913). With the advent of commercial films, which were housed in permanent theatres, a more complicated and elaborate sound process where the music played an increasingly larger role in the show was introduced. The competition among cinema owners meant that one piano became three; the three pianos would give way to a salon orchestra, which in turn gave way to a symphony orchestra (Cavalcanti, 1939). In these early days, music was used for two reasons: to hide the noise of the projectors and to provide an emotional atmosphere (Cavalcanti, 1939). From the beginning, it was understood that the sound affects the scene. In modern film and television, sound is edited last because it is the final opportunity the director has to fully shape the scene (Handzo, 1985). 25

2.4. MUSIC AND EMOTION

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

Figure 2.2: Intertitle from "All on Account of a Transfer" (Williams, 1913). When sound was first introduced in film, a system of leitmotifs was used; certain themes would be associated with certain characters as they appeared on the screen. Throughout the film, the orchestra would move from one short theme to the next (Cavalcanti, 1939). These pieces of music would be relatively well-known to the audience (e.g., portions of Pique Dame, Londonderry Air, the Mass in B Minor, etc.) (Cavalcanti, 1939). They were known by musicians to elicit specific moods responses (no one says how it was determined what mood category a piece belonged to). Either large film companies would prepare and publish a complete musical score for distribution with the films or the musicians would keep multiple sheet music on their stands, switching from one to the next as needed (Cavalcanti, 1939). These themes might also come from a published "mood music catalogue" that provided scores for specific moods (e.g., terror, joyful, etc.) Wierzbicki (2009). In essence, someone watching the same movie in two different theatres might have had similar emotional experiences, but heard different "sound tracks" to achieve it. With the introduction of the cinema organ came the ability to render effects. The organ's console would have several stops which might be labelled "train", "chains", "crockery", "horse", "siren", "side drum", "bass drum", "cymbals", "piano", "airplane", "child crying", etc. (Cavalcanti, 1939). This allowed the creation of live sound effects in the theatre as well as live music, further enhancing the emotional effect of the movie experience. The first "talkie" film using pre-recorded sound technology (called Vitaphone) was The Jazz Singer which opened in 1927. Vitaphone, which used 16-inch phonograph records, was developed in 1925. By the time The Jazz Singer opened, more than 130 American theatres were equipped with Vitaphone devices. The sound came directly from the phonograph player or, by microphone, through a public-address system. The first public showing of a movie using the first sound-on-film technology, Movietone (also developed in 1925), was a newsreel in 1927. Movietone used a variable-density optical track on the 26

same strip of film. There was no separate sound system required as the projector came with its own speakers. Vitaphone was owned by Warner Brothers, Movietone was owned by Fox. Another soundon-film technology developed by General Electric (and RCA), Photophone (patented in 1925), was used by everyone else (Wierzbicki, 2009). The sound-on-film formats of Movietone and Photophone became the dominant technologies. This technology is the basis of modern film sound (i.e., Dolby). Once the technology existed to integrate sound into the film itself, there was an immediate interest in speech synchronized with the moving picture. Soon after, the first "musical" films, movies based on Broadway musical shows, were introduced. This gave way to "performed-music" movies with personalities such as Canadian Deanna Durbin. Instead of the music being the sole focus of the film, the action of the story would continue while the performer sang. Combining music and drama had the effect of dramatic excitement, a new third element, "in which both music and images are enhanced, and suspense, humour, sentiment, acquire almost sensational valency." (Cavalcanti, 1939, p. 33). As a result of combining music and drama, two different kinds of film and television music emerged: diegetic, and non-diegetic. Diegetic, or source, music occurs where the source of the sound is presented within the scene (e.g., song on a radio, singer in bar, etc.). Non-diegetic (also called "extra-diegetic") music has no visible source in the scene; the music seems to come from nowhere and is not heard by the characters in the scene (e.g., mood music) (Kassabian, 2001). While commonly used in Europe, non-diegetic music did not enter the North American film industry until the 1950's (Wierzbicki, 2009). After World War II the presence of music in film became, as Jerry Goldsmith describes, saved for the "right moments and make them count", rather than used to fill the screen with as much sound as possible (Champlin, 1967). With the commercial success of the title song of High Noon in 1952, there was a phase where movie music production became more commercialized with the popular focus of getting soundtracks onto the charts and creating a commercial sensation (Wierzbicki, 2009). The "art" of moviemaking was no longer the sole motivation for film technology development. While it is not as common to see whole soundtrack albums hit the charts, there is still emphasis in marketing specific songs either when artists are also in the movie (e.g., Preacher's Wife ) or a popular artist records parts of the soundtrack (e.g., Titanic, Frozen ). A musicians' strike in 1958 and the temporary loss of music in films meant the orchestral score became less common and film music branched out into so many different forms (e.g., rock, jazz, blues, pop, synthesized, etc.), that the "classical" genre typical of previous films was no longer the only genre. Current film music cannot be described as a single genre (Wierzbicki, 2009). Further, with the added competition from television, studios focused on the development of new sound technologies, such as surround sound, to bring in audiences (Wierzbicki, 2009). The development of surround sound changed how audiences experienced music and other sound effects in the theatre. It opened up a whole new world of possibilities for sound use and design that allowed for greater realism because, if you can hear in stereo, it creates the illusion of being in the middle of the events in the film. The advent of surround sound also motivated greater quality control (e.g., through THX certification) to ensure clearer sound in all theatres. In modern film and television, music is used to provide "stock characterizations", musical archetypes that are based on cultural stereotypes, and instrumentation (Gorbman, 1987, p. 83) of the characters 27

2.4. MUSIC AND EMOTION

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

and scenes. For example, Kalinak (1982) describes conventions used in films in the forties and fifties to illustrate stock characterizations of "the fallen woman" and "the virtuous wife". Where the former gets dotted rhythms and jazz or blues style saxophones, the latter is presented with violins and flutes that sweep upwards melodically using even rhythms and simple harmonic language. Gorbman (1987) describes Hollywood's use of codified harmonies, melodic patterns, and rhythms in cinema for establishing setting. For example, the notion of "Indian territory" would be set by using a 4/4 allegretto drumbeat with the first beat emphatically accented. Turn-of-the-century Vienna might be set using a Strauss-like waltz. Rome and Paris are set using accordions. Similarly, a comedic character might be introduced by woodwinds or xylophones with occasional wrong-sounding notes. The impact of sound on the attention of audience members has some fairly well-known conventions and strategies. Audience members tend to give different levels of conscious attention to the music at different times according the prominence of the music compared with other sounds and visuals. Kassabian (2001) explores an "Attention Continuum" (p. 52) to describe this phenomenon. In descending order: Â· Theme songs. The audience will give the highest degree of attention to the theme song. They may have familiarity with it from film trailers, advertisements, other films, etc. Theme songs are used not just with the opening credits and opening scenes but also used as leitmotifs later in the film (e.g., James Bond). Â· Music presented as the only sound in a scene. Where there is no dialogue or other sounds in a scene competing for auditory attention, the music gets all of the auditory attention. Â· Music presented with little audio/visual competition. Sounds are in low profile compared to the music. Â· The scene is memorable but the music is not. Scenes with a great deal of visual activity with sound effects and music but little or no dialogue tend to have forgettable music. The music is usually presented to provide "a sense of pace and unity without commanding much attention" (p. 54). Â· Music presented as background to dialogue. Depending on the importance of the dialogue in the film, background music can be simple, subtle, and soft. Its role is only to affect mood. The audience will give little attention to such music. Other than these fairly basic strategies, the integration of music in film or television tends to follow a fairly intuitive process rather than programmatic. Holden (1989) states that in film music, "what's good is what works" (H19). However, one possible dilemma of this approach when examining how to convey this mantra using the visual domain is that it is not necessarily true that "what works" musically will translate into an equivalent visual expression directly.

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.5. SENSORY MODALITIES

2.5

Sensory Modalities

There are four major sensory modalities that can be used to present music.

2.5.1

Auditory

According to Loeffler, Western music uses a 12-tone octave tuning system (i.e., a "perfect octave"). An interval between two musical pitches is half or double the note's frequency; hence, the ratio between octaves is 2:1. For example one octave above A4 (440Hz) is 880Hz while one octave below is 220Hz. Octaves with a distance greater than 1 are calculated as 2n , where n denotes the octave. Perfect octaves are further split into 12 semi-tones, where each semi-tone contains 100 cents; thus, each octave contains 1200 cents (Loeffler, 2006). Notes produced by instruments are not a single pure tone frequency, but rather "a mixture of sinusoids of different frequencies with different weights that are perceived to be equivalent to single frequency" (Loeffler, 2006). For this reason, although humans can differentiate auditory pitches separated by 5 to 6 cents and musically untrained adults can reliably recognize differences of 25 cents, a human's ability to differentiate pitches of a note can be off by as much as Â±12 cents (Geringer & Worthy, 1999; Loeffler, 2006; Peretz & Hyde, 2003). The auditory modality would appear to be an obvious way to present music since music is naturally presented as sound. This modality is not useful to us because this is where the problem of presenting music to D/HH audiences lies.

2.5.2

Tactile

The development of technologies using the tactile modality to present music to D/HH people has a very long history. Here are a few examples: In December 1896, McKendrick reported to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow an experiment in electricity where he ran wires from a phonograph to two platinum plates dipped in a beaker containing a weak salt solution. Putting one's fingers into the salt solution while the phonograph was playing would stimulate the nerves such that one could feel rhythm, time, tone duration and intensity, each distinctive note, and each chord of music played by the phonograph via electric resistance, but no sensation of pitch. He reported to the Society a study involving four deaf persons, one of whom became deaf at eleven years old. She declared that what she felt was music. The others were able to appreciate the rhythm, bobbing their heads up and down, keeping time with the sensations in their fingertips (McKendrick, 1897). The following year, in a report to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, McKendrick reported repeating this experiment using a rubber lined trough for the saline solution and having deaf people put their hands into the trough. Experimenting with the deaf, he found they were startled by the effect. Deaf participants reported a pleasure sensation and felt they had a better appreciation for why people coveted music (see McPherson, 1897).

29

2.5. SENSORY MODALITIES

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

Figure 2.3: Deaf students taking a music lesson at the Alberta School for the Deaf in 1969. As illustrated in Figure 2.3, many schools for the deaf developed music programs where students were presented with music in some vibrotactile manner, such as lying on a large piano. In 1925, Gault began reporting a series of experiments where he and his colleagues exposed deaf participants to a device he called a "Teletactor", a hand-held machine with a series of five reeds each of which were tuned to different sets of frequencies, that had been connected to a phonograph. While most often used in experiments involving the tactile presentation of speech, music experiments were also conducted (Gault, 1927). In the 1980s, Darrow used a SOMATRON, a vibrotactile couch, to present music to deaf schoolaged children. Deaf students were able to discern pitch changes and identify rhythms (Darrow, 1992; Darrow & Goll, 1989). More recently, Karam et al. (2010) developed the Emoti-chair. This chair presents a high resolution audio-tactile version of music to the back as a means of presenting music to D/HH consumers. The system uses eight separate audio-tactile channels to deliver sound to the body, and provides an opportunity to experience a broad range of musical elements as physical vibrations (Karam et al., 2010). However, it is not a perfect system. According to Branje, the just-noticeable difference of human skin is 200 cents, with a maximum of 1000Hz; however, auditory music contains frequencies above 1000Hz. This means Emoti-Chair users are missing 19,000Hz of the music (Branje, Maksimouski, Karam, Fels, & Russo, 2010). While Emoti-Chair users are able to distinguish differences between frequencies as low as 200 cents and consistently distinguish frequency differences below 400 cents (one-

30

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.5. SENSORY MODALITIES

third of an octave), this is still less than the auditory system, which distinguishes differences as low as 6 cents (Loeffler, 2006).

2.5.3

Olfactory

The presentation of music information via olfaction, the sense of smell, has three challenges: metrics, technology, and perception. The first challenge is one of metrics, as Alexander Graham Bell asked a century ago, Did you ever try to measure a smell? Can you tell whether one smell is just twice as strong as another. Can you measure the difference between one kind of smell and another. It is very obvious that we have very many different kinds of smells, all the way from the odor of violets and roses up to asafetida. But until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor (Bell, 1914, p. 652). Where sounds can be measured in frequencies, and notes can be measured in semi-tones or frequency differences (and in the same manner we can describe colours in terms of frequencies and hues), we have no such equivalent for odours. Without such an equivalent, one cannot map auditory information to olfactory presentation. While there is ongoing work in this area (e.g., Secundo, Snitz, & Sobel, 2014), our understanding of the science of odour is still not sufficiently mature. The second challenge is one of technology. Quite simply, while there exist a variety of machines that can pump out various types of scent to provide olfactory cues (e.g., single scent olfactory icons), there is currently no machine that can rapidly release multiple scents to present information without overwhelming the environment (e.g., the breathing space). One can rapidly present multiple colours or multiple tones one at a time. Colours and tones are more transient than scent, which can linger and thus cause adaptation (Sarter, 2006; Sato, Ohtsu, Bannai, & Okada, 2009). The third challenge is one of perception. Consider some of the requirements an odour presentation system would demand on a human user. A system might: Â· present multiple scents at once, Â· rely on location to aid information presentation, and/or Â· rely on different qualities or quantities of scent to present information. But humans tend to discern one scent at a time, whichever is strongest. Humans lack the ability to smell "stereo scent" in the same way many humans can process stereo sound or stereo vision. While the human sense of smell is still very acute, recognizing thousands of different smells and detecting odours even in infinitesimal quantities, it is feeble, even clumsy, compared to that of many animals. As de Lespinois points out: [A] dog can sort through a myriad of scents simultaneously. So if we smell a stew cooking, dogs smell each ingredient of the stew, and the cook. Dogs can move one nostril at a time 31

2.5. SENSORY MODALITIES

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

permitting them to perceive the direction of a scent. Once they pick up the scent, it dissolves on their wet nose. These liquified molecules are then pushed further back into the snout. The dog devotes 40 times more of its brain power to smell than we do, using about 60 square inches of scent receptors called the epithelium. That's about the size of an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper. If you compared our scent receptor area, you would find it's a little smaller than a postage stamp (de Lespinois & Doe, 2010). Humans are capable of detecting certain substances in dilutions of less than one part in several billion parts of air. Humans have about five or six million olfactory receptors in our nose. We may not be able to match the olfactory feats of bloodhounds (whose nose has 300 million olfactory receptors), but humans can, for example, "track" a trail of invisible human footprints across clean blotting paper using our sense of smell (K. Fox, n.d.). Olfactory receptors are not solely confined to the nose, but are in fact found throughout the body in various organs. Recent research has found that olfactory receptors can even be found in the skin (Busse et al., 2014). The presentation of information via combinations of the tactile and olfactory modalities may be a potential future direction for olfaction-based information presentation. Thus, the identification and examination of possible uses, benefits and limitations of the olfactory channel remains one of the important research challenges in the area of multimodal information presentation (Sarter, 2006). But without a means of reliable odour measurement, production, and perception, the use of olfaction to present complex information is not yet within our grasp.

2.5.4

Visual

Human visual resolution is stronger than human auditory resolution. Humans can detect very small changes in visual illumination, but only a few different ranges in sound volume. Spatially, humans can detect a one degree change in the direction of a three dimensional sound whereas the central visual field can detect differences as small as two seconds. Similarly, very large amounts of information can be presented on a screen while the transient nature of sound requires their discrete presentation (Kramer, 1994). For D/HH people, the use of the visual modality to present information takes advantage of several observed strengths. In particular, Deaf adults tend to show greater visual attention. For example, the visual system of deaf adults may monitor their peripheral visual field more than hearing adults (Bavelier, Dye, & Hauser, 2006). This information path also takes advantage of mature technology people already have. Screens have become ubiquitous in our society. Everyone seems to carry a screen of some sort. Using a visual modality supports a cheap technology nearly everyone already has and avoids the need to purchase new untested technologies. Screens are also very portable, avoiding the need for people to purchase large bulky technology.

2.6. THEORIES OF INFORMATION VISUALIZATION & SONIFICATION

2.5.5

Sensory Substitution or Sensory Supplementation

Presenting information in multiple forms, (i.e. visually, auditorially, tactilely, etc.) falls into two major categories: sensory substitution and sensory supplements. Sensory substitution is the use of one sense to receive information normally received by another sense. Sensory supplements augment the perceptual information of the user with additional, possibly redundant, information using another sense. Cross-modal displays, where information that is designed to be presented to one sensory modality (i.e., audio, visual, and tactile) is displayed using an alternative modality, is the area of research in human-computer interaction that is involved in sensory substitution and supplementation (Karam & Fels, 2008). Cross-model displays range from presenting visual or audio information using haptic displays to presenting audio signals using visualizations. Typically, these displays are designed to support redundant presentation of information in applications such as games. For example, first person shooter games use a combination of music (e.g., to evoke heightened alertness) and sound effects (e.g., gunshots, footsteps) to present information (i.e., someone nearby is shooting at you) in addition to the visual display (e.g., explosions, gore). Sensory substitution systems designed for D/HH users include tactile displays such as the "emotichair" (Karam & Fels, 2008) and the "artificial ear" (Richardson & Frost, 1977). Other examples include signalling systems which are designed to visually present environmental sounds. For example, a ringing telephone might flash a lamp. The characteristics of the ringing tone (e.g., one long ring followed by one short ring) are represented by the flash pattern of the lamp to further indicate that it is the telephone and not some other environmental sound source such as a doorbell. Music visualization is yet another example of a cross-modal display because it presents audio signals that comprise music as visualizations. However, music visualization also involves the translation of meaning that is more than the sum of the information parts so that a direct translation of the basic music elements (e.g., frequency into waveform display) may not be appropriate or useful. The kind of information processed by a sensory substitution device is often metamodal, it can be accessed through any sensory modality (Martin & Le Corre, 2015). However, something is always lost in translation because the information presented in the alternative modality cannot fully capture / replace what the primary modality would have perceived (Tang, Fourney, Huang, & Carter, 2008). When used to substitute one modality for the other, to support users who are blind or deaf, there is a need to identify what characteristics of the input modality are necessary to present using the alternative display (Karam & Fels, 2008) and what characteristics will be lost / missing as a result of these choices. For these reasons supplementing a person's existing sensory capabilities is always preferred over sensory substitution.

2.6

Theories of Information Visualization & Sonification

Based on the notion that a visual presentation is easier to use than a textual description (Shneiderman, 1996), information visualization, the study of the visual representation of information, is a strongly 33

2.6. THEORIES OF INFORMATION VISUALIZATION & SONIFICATION interdisciplinary field. There are several different genres of visualization. For example, scientific visualization emphasizes realistic renderings of volumes and surfaces. It takes complex information, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and displays it in a manner that is comprehensible. Data visualization, on the other hand, attempts to represent data in an abstract form such as a mind map and can be more artistic. The human vision system is able to scan, recognize, and recall images rapidly. It can detect changes in size, colour, shape, movement, or texture. With this perceptual system, a human can point to a single pixel in a multi-pixel display (Shneiderman, 1996). For these reasons, the visual modality provides a higher bandwidth for information presentation than the other senses. There is no clear generally accepted definition of visualization; however, several models have been proposed (Kosara, 2007). Generally, visualizations draw on the following three criteria: Â· Based on non-visual data. The visualization is not image processing or photography, it is based on a data set that comes from outside the program. Â· Produces an image. One or more images are produced from the data, and these visual representations are the primary means of communicating the data. Â· Result is readable and recognizable. The resulting transformation should enable the viewer to understand the underlying data. This could mean the viewer requires training and practice to fully interpret the visualization (e.g., in the case of medical imaging). As Kosara notes, "a transformation of data into a visual shape does not imply readability" (Kosara, 2007, p. 632), in particular music visualizations, while data-based, are not readable. When approaching a visualization, the viewer needs to realize that data is being visualized, understand what is being visualized and then understand how the display is to be read (Holmquist, 2004). Shneiderman (1996) presents a mantra for how viewers approach information visualization: overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. He argues these tasks need to be supported in visualization interfaces. The overview enables the viewer to gain a sense of the dataset; to form a mental model (Shneiderman, 1996). This does not imply the overviewed data is the entire dataset, only that the viewer acquires an awareness of some aspect of some data rapidly and, where possible, pre-attentively (Spence, 2007). After getting an overview, the viewer may focus in on areas of interest, filter out uninteresting items, and finally select an item or group of items getting details on these items when needed (Shneiderman, 1996). Although Shneiderman (1996) suggests the overview must always precede the details, Spence (2007) suggests that certain use cases may be exceptions. It is entirely possible that the viewer might start by viewing one object in the dataset, the details, and then want to look at objects with related attributes. For example, a person shopping for a new house in an unfamiliar area may choose to look at one house just to get a sense of what is available as a starting point for forming a mental model (Spence, 2007). 34

2.6. THEORIES OF INFORMATION VISUALIZATION & SONIFICATION An example information visualization technique is the so-called "fisheye". The fisheye view is a method of distortion that allows the viewer to focus on specific data within the context of nearby and global data. Fisheyes are characterized by an in-place magnification of the area of interest encompassed by a continuous transition to the demagnification of the surrounding context (Gutwin & Skopik, 2003). The research presented in this Dissertation is interested in determining ways to convert sound (i.e., music) into visual information. The reverse process, Information sonification, uses sound to present information. Understanding how data is mapped into sound may help in arriving at ideas for how to convert sound into visual information. Information sonification (or auralization) draws on the field of visualization but presents data via sound. There are three types of sonification: Iconic Sonification, Direct Conversion Audification, and Musical Sonification. In Iconic Sonification, data is mapped to sounds associated with the phenomena. For example, when sonifying weather information, one might use the sound of rain to indicate a high probability of rain. Direct Conversion Audification uses a direct mapping of the data to sound. The user then listens for patterns that are represented in the data. For example electromagnetic wave data can be mapped directly to sound waves creating a sonification of the earth's magnetic field. In Musical Sonification, data is mapped to sound in a musical way. For example, the University of California, Berkeley church bells have been used as the basic element of a sonification of solar wind density data (Center for Science Education [CSE], 2010). The use of sonification takes advantage of certain perceptual strengths of human stereo hearing. For example (Kramer et al., 1997): Â· Human hearing is sensitive to changes in sounds over time. A person can discriminate between periodic and aperiodic events and can detect small changes in the frequency of continuous signals. In the case of human vision, such fast-changing or transient data might be blurred or completely missed. Â· Human stereo hearing allows the listener to be oriented in space in any direction. The direction of the source of the sound can be detected even if the source cannot be seen. By comparison, vision requires the viewer to be oriented in a particular direction to see the visual information. Â· Human hearing also provides auditory event memory. Highly notable musical patterns can be easily recognized and recalled even when subjected to radical transformations. For example, the same song at a higher or lower octave can still be recognized. These and other psychoacoustic skills assume the listener has stereo hearing (hearing in both ears), good auditory discrimination, and intact high and low frequency hearing. An example information sonification technique is LÃ¼bbers' "focus of perception" approach to music information retrieval. In discussing ways to aurally explore a large music collection, (LÃ¼bbers, 2005) draws on the "fisheye" method of information visualization to present a circular aura of "similar" songs. The user is presented monaurally multiple pieces at once. Depending on the distance of the song and the angle of its placement from the user's perspective, certain songs may be played louder than the 35

Figure 2.4: Focus of perception model. Adapted from LÃ¼bbers (2005). others and songs outside the aura will not be played at all. As the user changes their focus, they can zoom in on specific songs and select the one they want or move their aura to other songs. As shown in Figure 2.4, although song1 and song2 are the same distance to the listener's standpoint, song1 is played back louder since |1| is significantly lower than |2|. This "focus of perception" approach is an aural equivalent of Shneiderman's mantra, overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand.

2.7

Prior Work in Music Visualization

The visual representation of music has a long history. For example, Common Music Notation, the system of lines and notes used in Western countries to aid the performance of a musical composition, traces its origins to the Middle Ages (Isaacson, 2005). Many of these approaches act as supplements to the aural experience and are not intended to be used independently without sound accompaniment. Most of these approaches to visualization require large amounts of human intervention and creativity. Such intervention limits what is available to audiences that require a visual presentation of music and take time to develop. Human intervention means that time and other resources are spent to develop the presentation. The presentation of the information may not be the piece that the audience is interested in being shown. The interpretation of information will be idiosyncratic to the person making the interpretation. Music can be made visual through dance, paintings and other visual arts. For example, the 1940 Disney film, Fantasia, provides an animated visual rendition of music where various degrees of abstract and literal art are used to communicate the emotion, entertainment, and other properties of the music. In Fantasia, during a performance of Modest Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain, Chernabog summons fire and lava as a crescendo of timpani erupts. Such visual expressions of music are often one-time events for specific musical compositions. They require large amounts of human resources 36

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION

to produce a single result; something that would not be feasible for all television, film and music productions. A second example is the work of Nancy Herman. Starting in 1974, Herman developed a paintingstyle that links musical notes to colours and painted several well known musical compositions (Herman, 2009); however, each painting took "several weeks or even months to complete" (Mitroo, Herman, & Badler, 1979). Later, she attempted to visualize songs using fabric. The resulting works were not shown with musical accompaniment (N. Herman, personal communication, June 27, 2009). More recently, she used paint software to create static drawings (Herman, 2009) and videos in colour sequences that move in time to the music, as well as exploring the use of Flash to create "visual music" as "if the colors were attached to keys on a musical keyboard" (Herman, n.d.). All of her work involves human intervention.4 Closed captioned music videos also require human intervention. A single music video can be properly captioned "within a few days" and costs money (D. Russell, 1989). While they used to be quite rare, captioned music videos have become more common. Comments by the online survey participants mentioned above showed that providing captions for lyrics alone is not enough, there is a need to know why the music is being used, not just its contents. A recent trend is the development of thousands of YouTube videos of lyrics for songs. Again, using human intervention, the videos are hand crafted by volunteers. Often incorporating visual elements such as pictures or graphics related to the song or the artist, there is no standard for these videos. Many are difficult to read as a result of being too visually busy, having poor font choices, and other design issues. Thus, creating visualizations of music information by hand requires the expense of resources such as human effort, time, and money. Further, such visualizations restrict the amount of visual content available to D/HH audiences to a limited library that may not interest all members of the audience. There is a need for a way to visualize music that reduces the expense and expands the available selection. Before creating new visualizations for D/HH audiences, it is important to understand what has already been achieved in music visualizations so far.

2.7.1

Relevant Existing Visualization Solutions

For the purposes of this research, visualizing music means using software to generate a visual representation of specific music properties. The intent is to reduce the amount of human intervention and still enable users to visualize music in a way that is understandable, meaningful, and entertaining. Perhaps the simplest visualization of music available is probably that which can be produced by software that mimics an oscilloscope. Visually, pitch is depicted on an oscilloscope as the spacing between the peaks or valleys of the sound wave (i.e., the wavelength), the smaller the space, the higher the frequency or pitch. Amplitude appears as the height of the peaks and depth of the valleys of the
4 It is interesting to note that Frank Zappa often did the reverse. He would "draw music", create visual art (sketches, collages, etc.) of the music, before writing or playing it (Oregon Public Broadcasting, 2012).

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

Figure 2.5: A music visualization created by the Atari Video Music (Green, 2014). sound wave. The smaller the wave, the softer the sound. Early research in electronic music visualization focused on entertainment. One of the first attempts to electronically visualize music was the Atari Video Music, first released in 1976. A console designed to be connected to a record player and television set, the Video Music had twelve buttons and five knobs that enabled users to custom create the video effect (Wikipedia, 2014a). When placed in "Auto All" mode, the Video Music would react automatically to the music in real time (Brown, 1978). The resulting displays on the television were the `psychedelic' precursors to software-based music player visualizations. Colour was used to indicate the source channel (each of the left and right speaker had its own colour). The system was able to display 16 colours each of which would be used to show a specific frequency range (e.g., sounds in the 0 Â­ 120Hz range used colour 16, while sounds in the range 1200 Â­ 1440Hz used colour 7, no information was provided about why those specific colours were selected and assigned to each number). As seen in Figure 2.5, the music was presented in various visual arrangements in the form of diamond-shaped objects that were either solid, rings, or holes. Holes were created by having objects "subtracted" from one another (Brown, 1978; Wikipedia, 2014a). No user studies were ever conducted on this system. This console was on the market for about a year. In 1993, it returned to the market as the Atari Jaguar's built-in Virtual Light Machine (Wolf & Perron, 2003). Mitroo et al. (1979) proposed using software to synthesize visualizations of music in real time. Based on Herman's early work, the underlying hypothesis was that the spectral colours could be related to each other in the same way as musical tones to generate images of notes, chords, and chord progressions. The system was limited by the resolution of the display (240 Ã 320) and the available colours (4096). Although Herman's real paintings have been either square or rectangular, this system used a circular format (e.g., a chord progression would be displayed in concentric rings about the centre). Unlike the Atari device which could automatically generate visualizations from a sound 38

source, the system itself was not entirely "real time" since the tones were manually coded as numeric values. This resulted in a graphic presented on a raster graphics display described as a "musical painting" (Mitroo et al., 1979). Unfortunately, this work was never user tested. The idea of using colour to represent notes is still used and seems to have staying power (e.g., Malinowski, n.d.). However, the use of colour presents several challenges since, just as music is not culturally universal, there is no absolute set of cultural meanings for a given colour. Most colours can have positive or negative connotations and these vary not only among cultures but also among individuals. For example, in Western cultures black can represent formality, sophistication and sexuality, and it can also be a symbol of mourning. An example of differences between cultures is the meaning of white. In Western cultures, white is associated with weddings and purity yet, in Asia, it is associated with funerals and death. Colours can also have different meanings to different individuals. For example, a number presented in red may be meaningless to one individual, while it can mean debt to an accountant. The meaning and perception of colours are open to individual interpretation and may be misconstrued when used to represent music information and emotions without any additional cues. Around November 1986, Dalgarno developed a system which converted music into a coloured visual form displayed on a screen using a microcomputer. This system was accompanied by a "tactile sensation device" for people who were D/HH (Dalgarno, 1989). There are numerous music visualization styles that can be seen in common computer music players such as Windows Media Player, iTunes, and WinAmp. Those players that show visualizations of digital audio files such as WAV or MP3 usually respond to beat and/or frequency information that can be extracted from the digital audio file using readily available detection algorithms (e.g., Puckette & Apel, 1998). Developers of these visualizations admit that the selection of visual parameters (e.g., colour, shape, motion) that change in association with audio input (e.g., frequency, amplitude, timbre) tends to be arbitrary (Lipscomb & Kim, 2004). However, there has been little research to assess whether these visualizations provide sufficient information and entertainment for D/HH users. For example, the iTunes media player application provides visualizations based on waveform analysis. Figure 2.6 depicts the default visualizer used in iTunes 8, Magnetosphere. This music visualizer included moving streams of light that wrap around black, planet-like orbs. Based on an analogy of magnetism, the Magnetosphere visualization is a simulation of interacting charged particles, shown as balls of light; particles move about based on the strength of their magnetic charges. The magnetic charges change as a direct result of audio input (Hodgin, n.d.). For example, with increased amplitude, the visualization becomes more elaborate and fills more of the screen while differences in frequencies are depicted by the size of the charged particles. How the audio input impacts the visualization is not fully documented. While the result is visually pleasing, it is not very informative and can mislead the viewer. For example, without sound, this visually exciting visualization can lead viewers to believe the song is emotionally exciting even though it may be emotionally sad. Currently, however, most music visualization research focuses on music analysis and music education. Isaacson (2005) presents a review of seven different approaches used to visualize music for analysis such as spectrograms and tonal diagrams. While such visualizations can reveal sophisticated information about a musical work, they are useful and meaningful to those who are concerned about mu39

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

Real-time visualizations using design metaphors based on how musicians mentally visualize sound have also been developed to train musicians via visual feedback. Such systems improve the training of musicians because they allow the analysis of one's own sound quality (Ferguson, Vande Moere, & Cabrera, 2005). They may also provide interpretable metaphors for visual displays. A concrete example of this style of analysis which I present as a fairly representative example is the Music Animation Machine (MAM), which provides various visualizations of real-time music data based on MIDI file input. Three of them are: piano roll, part motion (balls), and tonal compass (Malinowski, n.d.). Â· The piano roll display, shown in Figure 2.7, conveys information about the music's structure through bars of colour representing the notes. These bars scroll across the screen as the music plays. Their position on the screen indicates their pitch (i.e., higher notes are higher on the screen, lower notes are lower) and their timing in relation to each other. Different colours denote different instruments or voices, thematic material, or tonality. In addition to a "now line", each note lights up at the exact moment it sounds (Malinowski, n.d.). Â· In the part motion or balls display, notes are represented by circles, the size of which corresponds to the length of the note. As shown in Figure 2.8, the notes of each part (a part is a unique track / channel combination) are connected sequentially by lines. When the note is sound40

Â· The tonality compass display, shown in Figure 2.9, arranges the pitches around a circle based on the circle-of-fifths model. Each pitch is denoted as a circle. The size of the circles show the "weight" of the pitch (weight is based on the dynamic level of the pitch). This visualization is particularly useful for showing chords and tonality (Malinowski, n.d.). Each of the MAM's different ways of viewing music is a different form of an equalizer. While some of its visualizations (e.g., the part motion or balls display) may prove visually interesting, such mu-

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

sic analysis-oriented visualizations require training, practice, and/or sound to fully understand. The MAM works as a music visualizer for musicologists, but it cannot stand alone; it requires sound to be fully understood (Fourney & Fels, 2009; Malinowski, n.d.). The focus of the MAM is on specific quantifiable qualities of music such as beat and frequency. Beyond certain primitive elements of music, even with these primitives summed to form a full visualization, it does not appear to represent emotion in a way that the music equivalent can. This is different from visualizations such as those provided by iTunes which are designed for their strong aesthetic appeal and do not seem to be concerned with the relationship to the music properties. Musician training applications often employ real-time visualizations using design metaphors based on how musicians mentally visualize sound. These applications have been developed to train musicians via visual feedback and represent an improvement over manual systems because they allow the analysis of a musician's own sound quality (Ferguson et al., 2005). Similar music visualizations have been developed to assist D/HH users to learn a musical instrument. For example, a computer-aided music learning system has been developed to assist D/HH junior high school students to play a melody on a flute. The system used a visualization of animated music notation to present real-time feedback to students. After 16 weeks of training, results showed students supported by the software had better music-learning performance than students who were not. Further, these students reported having a stronger interest in practising or learning music and put more effort into learning the instrument compared to traditionally instructed students (Yang, Lay, Liou, Tsao, & Lin, 2007). However, as will be discussed, using music visualizations in this way may not be culturally appropriate in all Deaf communities. Research in the use of avatars to display music information provides another direction of music visualization. For example, Taylor, Torres, and Boulanger created a system that allows musicians to interact with a life-sized virtual character in an immersive virtual environment using a wall-sized display. The system responds to the musician in real-time. Using a MIDI keyboard, the musician can either perform specific musical gestures triggering pre-programmed responses or perform spontaneously and observe the system's response. This system is also designed to model emotional information. Using a microphone, the musician can sing to the system which maps these vocal pitches to a model of Western tonal music theory to infer emotional meaning. The virtual character then makes specific movements based on this emotional inference (Taylor, Torres, & Boulanger, 2005). However, this animation was not user tested so it is unclear whether the resulting animation communicated an appropriate emotional effect.

2.7.2

Textual Visualizations

Textual visualizations of lyrics have been explored since the early 20th century and the advent of photography and the "magic lantern". The magic lantern slide projector could project glass slides that contained illustrated songs along with advertisements and public service announcements. Illustrated songs were a popular form of entertainment in the nickelodeon theatre that featured projected slides accompanied by live music (pi42

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION

ano and vocals). Most illustrated songs used popular melodies or tunes that were easy to sing along with. Illustrated songs would culminate with audiences singing along to the chorus at the end of the song (Altman, 2001; CineWiki, 2009; Wikipedia, 2014d). The slides served to "illustrate" the lyrics, making them come alive for the audience. A full set of slides for one song consisted of a title slide, fourteen or more narrative slides, and a chorus slide. The title slide, in addition to displaying the name of the song, depicted the cover of the sheet music (the main purpose of illustrated songs was to sell sheet music). The narrative slides, usually four slides for each verse and three for the chorus, corresponded to lines of the song and often used visual puns for comedic effect. The chorus slide was also the artistic signature of the slide maker, often containing information such as the slide maker's address (Altman, 2001). The magic lantern predated the existence of film. When film became popular, exhibitors simply projected the film reels from the same magic lantern projector. Despite the popularity of the illustrated song in the early 1900's, by 1913 illustrated songs had ceased production and disappeared from many theatres (Altman, 2001). During the so-called "silent era" of films (1894Â­1929), direct cueing, inserting song lyrics into the intertitles of silent films, was occasionally used as early as 1917 and became common practice by the mid-1920's, the "golden age" of silent film. However, as it is thought that a total of 70% of American silent films are believed to be completely lost (Pierce, 2013), direct cueing may have occurred even earlier and many unknown examples could exist prior to the mid-teens of the twentieth century. For example, in John Ford's 1917 film Bucking Broadway the lyrics of the song "Home, Sweet Home" are shown on the intertitles as the film shows cowboys clearly singing the song. This cued the audience to expect to hear the song and required the theatre's musician(s) to play the song (Kalinak, 2007). Various textual visualizations have been developed to present music information to D/HH people. Often these visualizations were developed to support using music and / or singing as a means to teach oral speech skills. In the 1970's, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) had a program to teach D/HH college students to sing. The lyrics would be presented using a simple overhead transparency and the (hearing) instructor would use a pointer to direct attention to the words of a song as they were played from a tape recorder (Murray, 1978). Murray developed a "balloon captioning technique" to present lyrics (1978; 1979). Using a prism as a type of "fisheye" lens and the lyrics set in type, Murray would photograph the lyrics onto high contrast film with the prism overlaid on the lyrics according to the timing of the song. Once the soundtrack was added, the resulting 16mm film could then be played with a soundtrack and synchronized lyrics. A three-minute song would produce a film of 4,320 frames. The visual result was a wave or bubble moving across the caption showing the viewer exactly which words are being spoken or sung. Unlike a bouncing ball visualization, which can distract the attention of D/HH viewers, this approach focuses attention on individual words while simultaneously making visible any time progression within individual words (Murray, 1979). Don Arioli, an animator with the National Film Board of Canada, had developed a similar technique where lettering ballooned in synchronization with the audio. However, Arioli's approach involved hand painted cells (three cells for each letter of every word) (Murray, 43

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION 1978).

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the first closed captioned and teletext broadcasts were delivered (Graziplene, 2000). Closed captioning is a technique for translating dialogue into text. A television set with a built-in decoder is able to display the translated text on the screen to match the dialogue of a show (Abrahamian, 2003). At that time, the display of text on the screen as closed captions or teletext was restricted by the limitations of the television display technologies. The North American captioning system, called Line 21 captioning, was invented around 1971. Within the analog NTSC television picture, 21 of the 525 lines are used for the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI). Line 21 is the last line of the VBI before the picture begins. Captions are encoded into line 21 and then decoded for the television viewer through a captioning decoder (Strauss, 2006). Each VBI line can carry data at a rate of 9600 baud or less (S. Smith, 1987). NTSC captioning, as per the EIA/CEA-608 standard, uses a fixed bandwidth of 480 bit/s per line 21 field for a maximum of 32 characters per line per caption (maximum four captions) for a 30 frame broadcast. It supports a monospaced font. The character set was largely based on ASCII with the exception of a few special characters, most notably an eighth note which is used to denote the presence of music (Wikipedia, 2014b). Captions could only be modified using italics (or slanted), all caps or mixed case. Traditionally NTSC captions are presented as white text over a black background, however colour is supported. With the advent of Digital television, ATSC broadcasts have many more features. Field (2000) provides a description of the technical standards for North American television. Captions can be presented in one of three modes: Roll-up, Paint-on, or Pop-on (Canadian Association of Broadcasters [CAB], 2012a). Â· With "pop-on captions", a phrase or sentence appears on the screen all at once, remains on screen for a few seconds, and then either disappears or is replaced by another full caption. The captions are timed to synchronize with the program and placed on the screen to help identify the speaker. Pop-on captions are used for captioning prerecorded programing. Â· "Roll-up captions" (or scrolling captions) roll onto and off the screen in a continuous motion. Usually two or three lines of text appear at one time. Each new line appears below the last new line pushing the other lines on the screen up. The top, or oldest, line of text disappears as each new line is added to the bottom. Roll-up captions are used for all live captioning and can also be used for prerecorded captioning. Â· "Paint-on" captions can appear similar to pop-on captions, but each word is added one at a time. It is most often seen during captioned television advertisements with very short lead in times because the delay necessary to broadcast a pop-on caption in advance of the initial spoken audio is too short. Pop-on captions are often considered the "gold standard" for captioning. Studies show that consumers prefer this type of captions to scrolling captions because they are perceived as easier to read (CONNECTUS Consulting Inc., 2008). 44

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION

The equivalent of NTSC closed captions used in countries that use PAL (e.g., Europe, Australia, etc.) is based on Teletext. Features such as colour, multiple fonts, different font sizes, mixed case lettering and animations are commonly used. To access the captions, viewers use a teletext enabled television (or equivalent set-top box) and, while watching the desired television channel, access a specific page of the teletext system (e.g., in Australia this is page 801). Historically, teletext was used to provide text versions of news stories, stock market figures, etc. (see Wikipedia, 2015a), but this service is no longer available. Currently, the only page of teletext is the captions (Aussie Deaf Kids, n.d.; Media Access, n.d.). It is an acceptable broadcast engineering practice when translating NTSC captions to teletext for PAL compatible countries to substitute the eighth note character used for denoting music for a number sign (#) because of its similarity to the musical sharp sign ( ) (Wikipedia, 2014b). Jordan, Albright, Branner, and Sullivan (2003) published an extensive report on the state of closed captioning in North America. They surveyed 107 D/HH captioning consumers and interviewed 17 industry representatives regarding their satisfaction and knowledge of closed captioning, and carried out a content analysis of existing captioning for quality and consistency. One of the important sound elements that was identified by D/HH people was the desire to have music captioned. Presently, music is typically identified through the listing of the song title and / or the appearance of a music note icon. Not only does this provide little information about the properties and meaning of the music, but it also has little meaning to people who have limited experience or interest in music. In Canada, the current (voluntary) English language captioning standard states the following for the display of music (CAB, 2012a): Â· Discourages the use of colour. Â· Discourages the use of paint-on captions to show lyrics as they are sung. Â· Requires the use of pop-on captions for lengthy lyric passages even if the rest of the program is captioned using roll-on captions. Â· Allows lyrics to roll-up only when "unusually fast" or when there are a few lines of singing mixed with conversation. Â· Requires the use of a music note at the beginning and end of each lyrical phrase, regardless of using roll-on or pop-on presentation, to indicate that the lines are being sung and not spoken. Â· Recommends writing out lyrics for all songs only if they are discernible. Â· Recommends using a descriptive parenthetical description of the music where lyrics are not discernible (e.g., "(60's rock instrumental)" vs. "(Music)"). The equivalent french language standard is largely the same except that it requires the captioning of lyrics only if the song is in French, otherwise the captions need only indicate the language of the song in parentheses (Canadian Association of Broadcasters [CAB], 2012b). In fact, lyrics are rarely displayed in captioning. One reason for this is that music used to elicit an emotional response to a television audience rarely has lyrics. For example, a scene intended by its 45

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

creators to be scary, and accompanied by mood music to create that effect for the hearing audience is likely to be captioned by: Â· a single eighth note; Â· some information on the music (e.g., "ominous") bracketed in eighth notes; Â· the name of the song (e.g., "Jaws Theme") bracketed in eighth notes; Â· a descriptive name of the song (e.g., "shark theme") bracketed in eighth notes; or Â· artist information as well as the name of the song (e.g., "John Williams' Jaws Theme") bracketed in eighth notes. All of which are highly unlikely to elicit a fear response. Harkins (1995) carried out a study on user attitudes toward closed captioning of non-speech information (NSI) in North America. NSI describes those aspects of the soundtrack, other than spoken word, that convey information about plot, humour, mood, or the meaning of a spoken passage. Deaf (n = 106) and hard of hearing (n = 83) consumers (93% of whom owned a captioning decoder at home) were asked to review a series of videos and rate them for preference. With respect to music, Harkins explored six ways to depict its presence: Description (e.g., "( soft, sad background music )", "( scary music )"); Music icon where an eighth note would appear in the top-right corner of the screen; Music icon and capital letters where lyrics would appear in capitalized text bracketed by one eighth note at the beginning and end of each caption block; Music icon and upper/lower case letters where lyrics would appear in mixed case text bracketed by one eighth note at the beginning and end of each caption block; Paint-on lyrics where words would appear as they are sung using the paint-on approach of captions; and No description where no additional information would be shown (Harkins, 1995). In scenes with background music, 83% of participants preferred description while in scenes with singing, 82% of participants choose styles with the music icons. In their concluding recommendations Harkins (1995). recommended that: 1. background music be indicated especially if it contributes to the plot or mood, 2. a description of the music should be given where possible, and 3. music note icons should surround lyrics. 46

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION

They provided no recommendation on the use of mixed case lettering. The paint-on style of presenting the lyrics, a very new technology at the time, was rejected as only 18% of participants expressed any preference for it. Participants clearly expressed a desire to have more of the background sound information such as music and sound effects provided, but tended to reject new approaches to presenting NSI. In addition to rejecting the use of paint-on captions to present lyrics, Harkins (1995) also found that using other new features to present NSI, such as colour and flashing text, were also not acceptable to participants. Music visualizations for D/HH users have begun to explore how to communicate emotional information through the lyrics. For example, EnACT, a software tool for creating animated text captions, enables users to mark emotions in lyrics and then render those marks into animated text for display as captions (Vy, Mori, Fourney, & Fels, 2008). However, lyrics are typically sung in a way that can communicate information about the music, not just the emotional content. A second example is a system developed by Diaz-Marino, Carpendale, and Greenberg (2005). It uses kinetic or moving text to communicate how the lyrics are being sung not just what is being sung. Traditional karaoke displays assume that the singer already knows and can hear the tune, there is no information provided on the musical properties of the song. Diaz-Marino et al. (2005) added visualizations of vocal properties such as pitch and force as well as information about beat and timing to a karaoke style display. This system was not user tested so it is unclear whether their visualization strategy worked to communicate the emotions contained in the lyrics. Fels, Lee, Branje, and Hornburg (2005) used graphics, colour, icons, animation and text to present music information in television programming. Icons were used to depict music. For example, a violin icon would move across the screen to show a change in music pitch or tempo. Text was used to depict lyrics. Emoticons (e.g., smiley face) were used to show the emotions. Colour was used to show emotion and intensity. However, a usability study found that D/HH audiences did not like the use of colour and deaf audiences generally did not accept this use of graphics and icons. Silverman and Fels (2002) created graphic captions using a comic book approach. They used speech bubbles and icons with descriptions to depict background sounds and transitions in the video short "Il Menu," an amusing spoof on opera that contained dialogue and music. For example, a piano keys icon was used to indicate music. It was marked by a red "x" to indicate that the music had suddenly stopped. A usability study found that D/HH viewers thought that the approach increased their understanding of the content and heightened their sense of themes, depth, and feeling but they had difficulty with the use of comic conventions because they associated these conventions with children's content. Canadian Network for Inclusive Cultural Exchange [CNICE] (2005) describes how an animation was added to the opening scene of the TV series "Rocket Science". The scene begins with the "CC" or closed caption symbol morphing into a musical note which then moves and weaves through the show's opening animated sequence. This animation was intended to both let the user know about the music and give a sense of the music itself. However, this animation was not user tested so it is unclear whether the animated notes created the desired enjoyment effect. Other text based visualizations of music information display information about the song and artist 47

2.7. PRIOR WORK IN MUSIC VISUALIZATION

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

but not the lyrics. For example, the radio text (RT) function specified within the Radio Data System (RDS) of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 62106 allows a radio station to transmit a 64-character free-form string that can be in sync with the station's programming (e.g., the title and artist of the currently playing song). This information can then be displayed to the listener via a screen attached to the radio. Outside of the captioning research discussed above, there has been little research to assess whether music visualizations provide sufficient information and entertainment for D/HH users. The properties of music that tend to be provided in visualizations are lyrics, tonality, harmony, loudness, pitch, and timing. There is limited work in visualizing the emotional content of music. While these sound elements are creatively combined by musicians to express emotions and provide entertainment, it is unclear whether using visual equivalents of these sound elements and their combination can produce similar or equivalent effects. Chapters 5 and 6 will present studies designed to try to answer these questions.

2.7.3

Visualizations and Emotion

Information visualization is generally understood to be a part of human-centred computing. As such, visualization techniques usually need to be evaluated in user studies. They are designed for immediate understanding, not emotional response (Kosara, 2007). Visualizations impact emotion when designed with a view for aesthetics. For example, the sublime, that which inspires awe, grandeur, and evokes a deep emotional and/or intellectual response, is an aesthetic criterion that can be used to assess visualizations. Works of art generally possess a sublime quality. Visualizations, with their focus on usability and immediate understanding, should be antisublime (Sack, 2011). As Kosara (2007) states, The sublime subsumes the two criteria of readability and recognizability, since for a work of art to be sublime, it cannot be easily readable (or user friendly). It must present enough of an enigma to keep an audience interested without being easy to solve. The opposite is obviously true for a tool that is designed to aid in data analysis. (p. 633). Aesthetics cannot be ignored. Research suggests that, when tasked with gleaning information from visualizations, users approach aesthetic visualizations more thoroughly and with greater patience (Cawthon & Moere, 2007). However, "there is a lack of holistic empirical studies to characterize what visual properties make users think a graph is pretty or visually appealing" (Chen, 2005, p. 15). While music and its impact on emotions is a domain under active research, the emotional impact of information visualization is less understood. Further, "there is no single theory of aesthetics" (Filonik & Baur, 2009, p. 580). Each domain, whether art, psychology, industrial design, etc., approaches aesthetics in very different ways. Everyone has a subjective view of aesthetics as a result of their personal, social, and cultural background.

2.8. SUMMARY

2.7.4

Why Music Visualizations?

As mentioned earlier, creating visualizations of music information by hand raises several issues. Such visualizations: Â· require the expense of resources such as human effort, time, and money; and Â· restrict the amount of visual content available to D/HH audiences to a limited library that may not interest all members of the audience. On the other hand, automated visualizations have several advantages. Using these visualizations D/HH audiences are Â· able to access the music information on their own terms; Â· not controlled by the musical preferences of others; and Â· not dependent on the work of others. The visualization of music might be one (of possibly many) tools that can be used to make a particular type of information, the music and its patterns, more widely available to the D/HH. It promotes the independence of the D/HH music consumer.

Summary

The purpose of this chapter was to provide background information to these areas of the D/HH communities, music, and the various ways different types of music information have been presented; show how past research relates to the current research questions; and explore open issues where the current research questions may provide more information. In North America, hearing loss is the third most chronic disability among older adults and the fastest growing hidden disability. While the difference between those who describe themselves as Deaf and those who describe themselves as Hard of Hearing is largely cultural, both groups have concerns with respect to music that is not well understood. The literature regarding that nature of music typically assumes that the reader can hear. Few authors make any attempt to explain music to those who cannot hear or do not hear very well. Music is made up of nine atomic primitives (i.e., tone, pitch, timbre, loudness, tempo, rhythm, contour, spatial location, and reverberation) each of which can be varied without altering the others. The brain organizes these nine musical attributes into four higher level concepts (i.e., metre, key, harmony, and melody). Other properties exist (e.g., agreeableness) which result from combining these atomic primitives and higher order properties in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Composers use these properties in creative ways to create music that fits the desired mood they want to express in the hopes the audience interprets the same mood.

49

2.9. NEXT STEPS

CHAPTER 2. BACKGROUND

Music affects people's feelings. While culture may play a role in judgments of emotion in music, Western listeners are able to perceive emotional expressiveness in the music of an unfamiliar tonal system and evidence suggests that this ability is based on psychophysical elements such as tempo, timbre, and complexity rather than musical experience, knowledge, or enculturation. Nonetheless, musical conventions (e.g., leitmotifs, codified rhythms, etc.) and other psychophysical elements are used in film and television entertainment to provide the emotional atmosphere. Of the four major sensory modalities that can be used to present music, the auditory modality is not useful because this is where the problem of presenting music to D/HH audiences lies; the tactile modality is an active research area for music information presentation but involves large, expensive, non-portable equipment; and the olfactory modality has ongoing challenges which must be addressed before its use for complex information presentation is possible. The visual modality takes advantage of mature, cheap, potentially portable technology and a complex range of human visual capabilities. There is a long history of prior art in music information visualization. Creating visualizations of music information by hand requires the expense of resources such as human effort, time, and money. Issues relating to design and ease of interpretation as well as the limited library of what has been made available make this approach infeasible. Using software to generate visual representations of specific music properties seems to be a more feasible approach because it both reduces the expenditure of resources and increases the range of music available to audiences. Recall that one of the research questions explored by this Dissertation is: What are the fundamental properties of music that a visualization must present and that produces an entertaining and meaningful experience for D/HH people? It is clear from the literature reviewed above that music is a highly complex information space. This raises several questions about whether the focus of visualizations should be on specific atomic music primitives (e.g., tones) or higher level concepts (e.g., melody, key), both, or something else entirely. The literature suggests that music is a highly complex container of shared information and knowledge presented through sound. For hearing people, music is not just a cultural element, it impacts their lives. What is not clear in the literature is whether music impacts D/HH communities in similar ways. Recall another of the research questions explored in this Dissertation is what, if any, emotional experiences and interpretations users might get from visualizations. It is clear from the literature that music communicates complex emotional signals and that it has specific conventions designed to manipulate emotions. What is not clear in the literature is whether this can be translated into other modalities.

Methodology
Given the wide range of research areas discussed in the previous chapter, various methods and tools were combined for this Dissertation. Primarily, the methodological focus was on user-centred or participatory research design tools such as focus groups, interviews, and surveys. Other methods, such as Grounded Theory (GT), were embedded as needed. While not generally used during the execution of the experiments reported in this Dissertation, the Design Research Methodology (DRM) (Blessing & Chakrabarti, 2009) was used to organize the reporting of the experiments and the results. DRM is primarily developed for executing design research (Blessing & Chakrabarti, 2009). However, it provides a useful organizing principle for research through design. An iterative approach composed of four stages, individual research projects using DRM often focus on one or two stages only repeating them until some goal is reached. This application of the scientific method to design is the only methodology of its kind in engineering design. As shown by the breadth of the literature review in the previous chapter, there is so little research involving music and the D/HH population that a research methodology well suited for areas where there is very little existing knowledge or research is needed. GT is one such research methodology. Unlike positivist research, which starts with a hypothesis, a study using GT may begin with a question, or even just a collection of qualitative data. Data is collected, coded, reviewed, refined (as "categories"), and eventually becomes the basis for constructing new theory. Typically, it requires the researcher to review what literature may exist, collect data, analyze it towards the development of a theory, adjust and collect more data, further define concepts and theories, and then perform a literature search based on the information collected to compare any emergent theory with extant literature (Pace, 2004). This is then used to build further research. These methodologies will be discussed in more detail below.

3.1. DESIGN RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY

3.1

Design Research Methodology

The main aims of the DRM are to a) help researchers in identifying research areas and projects, b) help researchers in selecting suitable research methods to address the issues, and c) quantify the benefits and problems with a particular design intervention. DRM pieces together the various types of research to encourage a reflection on the research approach applied, and to provide pointers to methods in other disciplines that are useful for addressing the variety of aspects involved in engineering design. In sum, the DRM's four main stages traverse from understanding the problem space and measuring the "as is" situation to implementing a design or intervention and measuring its impact. The four main iterative stages are:

3.1.1

DRM Stage 0: Criteria Definition / Research Clarification

The first DRM stage, Criteria Definition / Research Clarification, identifies the goals that the research is expected to fulfill and the focus of the research project. The problems, questions and hypotheses of the research and the relevant disciplines and areas to be reviewed are determined. Since its primary role is to develop an initial representation of the existing situation and of the desired situation, in this stage designers make explicit the current understanding and beliefs. The resulting preliminary understanding and overall research plan become the focus of the next DRM stage.

3.1.2

DRM Stage 1: Descriptive Study I

The second DRM stage, Descriptive Study I (DS-I), aims to provide a basis for the development of modifications (so-called "supports") to improve design and often results in a reference model or theory (i.e., the Initial Reference Model(s)). In essence, the DS-I stage is about measuring a baseline, or determining the "as is" state of a situation before some kind of intervention is applied. The role of the DS-I stage is to obtain a better understanding of the existing situation by identifying and clarifying in more detail the factors that influence the current situation, identifying and clarifying the way in which these factors influence the situation, and suggesting the factors that might be suitable to address in the next DRM stage, as these are likely to lead to an improvement of the existing situation. These goals are met through a literature review of relevant empirical studies or conducting empirical studies.

3.1.3

DRM Stage 2: Prescriptive Study

The third DRM stage, Prescriptive Study (PS), attempts to develop an impact model or theory, based on the Initial Reference Model(s) or new understanding created in the Descriptive Study stages. The Impact Model / Theory describes the expected improved situation should some modification occur.

52

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY

3.2. GROUNDED THEORY

In essence, the PS stage is about changing the "as is" situation through the application of an intervention. This is where designed things are created and exposed to users. Having developed an Impact Model describing the desired, improved situation expected as a consequence of the modification(s), the designer selects some part of the Impact Model to address and determines the related Success and Measurable Success Criteria which will be used to evaluate the modification. The resulting Outline Evaluation Plan is used in the next DRM stage.

3.1.4

DRM Stage 3: Descriptive Study II

The fourth DRM stage, Descriptive Study II (DS-II), is a process of verification and validation to identify whether the modification can be used in the situation for which it is intended. It attempts to determine whether the modification does address the factors it is supposed to address (i.e., is it usable) as well as whether the modification contributes to success or has any implications / side effects (i.e., is it useful). New understanding derived from this stage can lead to a new Reference Model / Theory to be applied in a further PS. In essence, DS-II is about repeating the measurements from DS-I to see the changes caused by the intervention introduced in PS. Also in this stage, the differences between baseline and new situations is analyzed to determine the degree of success of the intervention. The role of DS-II is to identify whether the modification can be used in the situation for which it is intended. This stage evaluates the modification to determine whether it addresses the factors it is supposed to address and whether it contributes to success, addressing usefulness, implications and side effects.

3.2

Grounded Theory

Grounded Theory (GT) will be seen in Chapter 8. GT is a qualitative research methodology that was developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss in the 1960's for research involving human participants (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). It was originally intended for use by sociologists, but has since been applied to a variety of fields (e.g., social work, health studies, psychology, management, etc.) and has been adapted accordingly (Goulding, 1999). Since its first publication, both authors have diverged. Currently, there are at least two schools of GT, (i.e., Glaserian and Straussian). The focus of this section will be the original method.

3.2.1

The Basics

GT has three basic elements: concepts, categories and hypotheses. Concepts are the basic units of analysis. It is from the conceptualisation of data, rather than the data itself, that theory is developed. Concepts describe the way a researcher labels like events. As Corbin and Strauss (1990, p. 7) state:

53

3.2. GROUNDED THEORY

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY

Theories can't be built with actual incidents or activities as observed or reported; that is, from "raw data." The incidents, events, happenings are taken as, or analyzed as, potential indicators of phenomena, which are thereby given conceptual labels. If a respondent says to the researcher, "Each day I spread my activities over the morning, resting between shaving and bathing," then the researcher might label this phenomenon as "pacing." As the researcher encounters other incidents, and when after comparison to the first, they appear to resemble the same phenomena, then these, too, can be labelled as "pacing." Only by comparing incidents and naming like phenomena with the same term can the theorist accumulate the basic units for theory. Categories are a kind of concept container. Although higher in level and more abstract than the concepts they represent, categories are generated through the same analytic process of making comparisons to highlight similarities and differences that is used to produce concepts. As explained by Corbin and Strauss (1990, p. 7): Categories are the "cornerstones" of developing theory. They provide the means by which the theory can be integrated. We can show how the grouping of concepts forms categories by continuing with the example presented above. In addition to the concept of "pacing," the analyst might generate the concepts of "self-medicating," "resting," and "watching one's diet." While coding, the analyst may note that, although these concepts are different in form, they seem to represent activities directed toward a similar process: keeping an illness under control. They could be grouped under a more abstract heading, the category: "Self Strategies for Controlling Illness." Conceptual categories can then be explored in other comparison groups, which may support the categorical concept or suggest modifications to make it more generalizable. GT strives toward verification through the process of category saturation, staying in the field until no further evidence emerges (Goulding, 1999). Hypotheses (or "propositions" or "theories") indicate generalized relationships between a category and its concepts and between discrete categories. They provide a collection of explanations that explain the subject of the research. It should be noted that GT is explicitly emergent; it does not test a hypothesis. Instead GT sets out to find what theory accounts for the "research situation" as it is. Thus, generating hypotheses from the data requires only enough data to suggest the hypothesis, not to prove it. New theory is developed from the contrast between "the daily realities (what is actually going on) of substantive areas" (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 239) and how those who participate in these "daily realities" (i.e., the "actors") interpret them. In this sense, GT is an interpretive process. It looks for, "the actual production of meanings and concepts used by social actors in real settings" (Gephart, 2004, p. 457). The GT process of generation and development of concepts, categories and hypotheses is an iterative process. Theory is not generated a priori and then subsequently tested, rather, as Corbin and Strauss (1990, p. 23) describe, it is, 54

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY

3.2. GROUNDED THEORY

. . . inductively derived from the study of the phenomenon it represents. That is, discovered, developed, and provisionally verified through systematic data collection and analysis of data pertaining to that phenomenon. Therefore, data collection, analysis, and theory should stand in reciprocal relationship with each other. One does not begin with a theory, [and] then prove it. Rather, one begins with an area of study and what is relevant to that area is allowed to emerge. Further, theory generation does not require many cases. Just one case could be used to generate conceptual categories and then a few more cases could be used to confirm them (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The idea, "is not to provide a perfect description of an area, but to develop a theory that accounts for much of the relevant behavior" (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 30). Therefore, GT is an iterative emergent process which observes behaviour and events and then labels them in a manner consistent with the meaning/interpretation of these events by the actors. The GT methodology results in a set of concepts organized by categories and summarized by hypotheses.

3.2.2

Approach

The GT methodology, as described by Glaser and Strauss (1967), is built upon two key concepts: "constant comparison", and "theoretical sampling". Both concepts violate longstanding positivist assumptions about how the research process should work (Suddaby, 2006). Â· In constant comparison, data are collected and analyzed simultaneously. This contradicts the myth of a clean separation between data collection and analysis. Â· In theoretical sampling, decisions about which data should be collected next are determined by the theory that is being constructed. This violates the positivist ideal of hypothesis testing in that the direction of new data collection is determined, not by known hypotheses, but by ongoing interpretation of data and emerging conceptual categories. GT research may be based on single or multiple sources of data such as interviews, observations, focus groups, life histories, and introspective accounts of experiences. The use of multiple data sources, known as "triangulation", is preferred since it enhances construct validity and reliability (Pandit, 1996). At the same time, researchers avoid being too structured in their methods of collecting information. For example, an interview is not conducted using a prescribed formal schedule of questions since this would defeat the objective: to attain first hand information from the point of view of the informant. However, informants usually want some sense of the nature of the research and what information is sought. Thus, a totally unstructured interview would cause confusion and incoherence, and result in meaningless data, while a totally structured interview may be just an extension of the researcher's expectations. A balanced approach which allows the informant to feel comfortable enough to expand on their experiences, without the researcher telling them what to say is most desired (Goulding, 1999).

55

3.2. GROUNDED THEORY

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY

Careful selection of interviewees can be guided by the notion of theoretical sampling. In GT, the sampling of informants is directed by the emerging theory. A researcher will initially go to the most obvious places or most likely informants for information. As concepts are identified and the theory starts to develop, further individuals, situations and places can be incorporated to further strengthen the findings (Glaser, 1978; Goulding, 1999). It is important to note that the theoretical sampling of GT is very different from the statistical (or random) sampling commonly used in quantitative studies. Theoretical sampling aims to maximize opportunities for exploring emerging concepts. Statistical sampling aims to be representative of the population under study (Pace, 2004). As data are collected, they are analyzed using open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. This is then tied together through memoing. Open coding is the process of breaking down the data into distinct units of meaning. This process is associated with early concept development. For example, an interview would be fully transcribed, the text would be analyzed line by line in an attempt to identify key words or phrases which connect the informant's account to the experience under investigation (Goulding, 1999). Axial (or Theoretical ) coding is a process which identifies the dynamic interrelationships of concepts (Goulding, 1999). This process is associated with identifying categories. Selective coding is the process of delimiting coding to only those concepts that relate to the core category (Pace, 2004). If a core category is identified during a study, it may become its main theme. In selective coding, data collection and analysis becomes more focused, resulting in a theory with a smaller set of higher-level concepts (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Memoing is a process of tying together pieces of data to general concepts. Memos are short documents that a researcher writes to themselves as they proceed through the analysis of a body of data. It is a sense-making tool that records the researcher's insights and ideas when they strike (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Such memos can be used to help reorient the researcher at a later date (Goulding, 1999).

3.2.3

Software Support

GT is a labour-intensive methodology. Various software tools have been developed to support it. For example, NVivo (2012), which integrates well with SPSS (IBM Corp., 2013), handles various types of data sources including documents and transcripts. In particular, it links audio and video to transcripts very well. It can help with creating links among data (Richards, 2014). However the use of computer software to code qualitative data in GT has been criticized. For example, Goulding (1999) argued that "an over-reliance on computer-aided analysis minimizes the personal experiences of the researcher, the process, and the situational factors which serve to add depth, rather than detract from the emerging developments."

When Should Grounded Theory be Used?

According to Glaser, "Grounded Theory becomes an answer where other methodologies did not work well enough, especially in the sensitive dependent variable fields within the health science and business and management." (Glaser, 1995, p. 15). According to Stern, ". . . the strongest case for the use of grounded theory is in investigations of relatively uncharted water, or to gain a fresh perspective in a familiar situation." (Stern, 1995, p. 30). According to Strauss and Corbin, "If someone wanted to know whether one drug is more effective than another, then a double blind clinical trial would be more appropriate than grounded theory study. However, if someone wanted to know what it was like to be a participant in a drug study, then he or she might sensibly engage in a grounded theory project or some other type of qualitative study." (Corbin & Strauss, 1990, p. 40). This methodology generates substantive as well as formal theories, in either a well codified set of properties or running theoretical discussions; it is a theory generator (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). As such, GT is most appropriate to situations where phenomenon is poorly understood and theory may not exist. Note, however that GT is not "atheoretical". According to Goulding (1999), there is a common belief that GT ignores or avoids extant theory until the end of the analytical process. He argues that while it is true that GT was developed at a time when sociology had too great an emphasis on the verification of existing theory, in fact, existing theory has an important role in sensitizing the researcher to the conceptual significance of emerging concepts and categories (Goulding, 1999). According to Glaser, knowledge and theory are inextricably interlinked and should be used as if they were another informant (1978). Without this grounding in extant knowledge, pattern recognition would be limited to the obvious and the superficial, depriving the analyst of the conceptual leverage from which to develop theory (Glaser, 1978). Thus, GT requires an understanding of related theory and empirical work to enhance theoretical sensitivity (Goulding, 1999).

Participants

This Dissertation involved several different kinds of studies including focus groups, interviews, online and paper surveys, and usability studies. Altogether, 8 different music visualization styles were tested. In total there were more than 100 unique participants across the studies described in Chapters 4 to 7. The study discussed in Chapter 8 drew on participants from the study in Chapter 7. All population groups were represented (Hard of Hearing, Deaf, Deafened, and Cochlear Implant users). Participants ranged from 18 to over 65 years of age. Generally, there were more women participants than men (about 70%:30%).

The next five chapters each describe one of the five experiments conducted for this project. Figure 3.1 shows the order of the experiments. Note that the paper survey and interviews were conducted at the same time.

Figure 3.1: Order of experiments. As mentioned earlier, the DRM provides a useful organizing principle for research through design. While it dies not attempt to follow the DRM as a method, this Dissertation will use the DRM as a means of tying the various elements of this project together. As seen in Figure 3.2 on the facing page, the DRM occurs within this Dissertation as a set of loops combined into one larger loop. Each of the four stages of an "inner loop" DRM cycle is marked by numbers in boxes. For the Dissertation as a whole, the work in each chapter represents part of the DRM and its iterative approach: Â· The first DRM stage, Criteria Definition / Research Clarification was largely completed through the background provided in Chapter 2. Â· Given the limited literature on the issue of music and the D/HH communities, Chapter 4 describes a web-based survey of music attitudes that was attached to a larger experiment of animated lyric captions. The results of this study shows a need for the current project and represents part of the scoping required by DRM Stage 0. Â· A focus group conducted to evaluate various music visualizations as part of the DS-I (Descriptive Study I) stage of the DRM, providing a baseline of critical parameters in a situation into which some design intervention will be eventually introduced, is described in Chapter 5. These visualizations were either publicly available or prototypes designed and developed at Ryerson University. Â· Chapter 6 contributes to DRM Stage 2 (Prescriptive Study) as various music visualizations explored in Chapter 5 were discarded and new prototypes were designed and developed at Ryerson. Chapter 6 describes a focus group conducted to evaluate this revised set of music visualizations.

Figure 3.2: Dissertation path. Â· Chapter 7 opens with a recognized need to refine the scoping of DRM Stage 0 discussed in Chapter 4. One of the ongoing issues was that the focus groups were more skewed in the number of d/Deaf participants or issues that might be perceived as specific to the d/Deaf and it was not clear if HH people had specific needs unique to their community. A paper survey was conducted at a conference for HH people to get more information from members of the HH community. Chapter 7 describes the results of this survey. In addition to returning to DRM Stage 0, this process also revisited DRM Stage 1, DS-I. Â· Finally, since there was a need to get a better sense of an individual's response rather than the response of a focus group, one-on-one interviews were conducted among HH people. Chapter 8 describes these interviews and discusses their findings. This process further revisited DS-I and contributed to the PS stage. As Figure 3.2 shows, a series of smaller DRM loops is also seen in this Dissertation. The experiments within each of Chapters 4, 5 and 6 show the full DRM cycle because they introduce an intervention, the exposure of the participants to some prototype, and measure key parameters in their appreciation of music. The experiments in Chapters 7 and 8, when combined, also show the full cycle, with Chapter 7 representing the scoping Stage 0 and Chapter 8 continuing the loop.

Need for the Work
For hearing people, music is not just a cultural element. As McGraw (2008, Nov. 12) states, "music is so important. It's that thread that ties all your life together. . . . It weaves you through, even some of the dark times in your life." While this may be true for hearing people, it is not clear that the D/HH appreciate music in the same way, if at all. The success of individuals such as Sean Forbes, a deaf rapper, suggests that some level of appreciation does occur (Maler, 2013). Hearing people repeatedly report music evoking emotional responses and memory flashbacks (Janata et al., 2007), relaxation (Knight & Rickard, 2001), and other experiences which make music pleasurable (Kohut & Levarie, 1950). As a result, music is an important medium for conveying cultural information such as shared experience and knowledge (e.g., Loersch & Arbuckle, 2013; Rose, 1994). When D/HH people do not have access to the music of the larger hearing culture, access to this shared experience Â­ a shared knowledge space Â­ may be lost. What is not clear is whether the D/HH consumer even wants access to this information. This chapter explores the questions of: Â· Do D/HH people appreciate music, and are efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH wanted? Â· If the D/HH want accessible music information, what types of information would be considered useful and how should it be presented? First, this chapter will present a review of the literature on the music experiences of the D/HH. Then it will describe an online study conducted to assess the desirability of having access to music by D/HH participants. Finally it will report the results of that study.

Background
Music in the Primary and Secondary Schools

In Western Culture, music holds such value that it is routinely included as part of a standardized curriculum for formal early years, elementary and secondary education (e.g., Ministry of Education and 61

4.1. BACKGROUND

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

Training, 1998) even though controversy exists on whether such music programs are properly supported (Coalition for Music Education in Canada [CMEC], 2005). Music programs have been provided to D/HH students in North America for over a century (Solomon, 1980). The first article in the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb (the precursor to the American Annals of the Deaf ) to advocate for music education for D/HH children was published in 1848 (Darrow & Heller, 1985). The first known use of music in the education of the D/HH was a drum used in a military training class at the New York School for the Deaf in 1877 (Burns, 1965). Where programs are provided, it is not always true that D/HH students are fully involved. Darrow and Gfeller (1991) reported that 23% of mainstreamed D/HH students in school systems that they surveyed did not receive any music education while more than half (52%) attended regular music classes. More recently, Fix (2008) found that, of 27 oral schools for the deaf surveyed, 22 (81%) had music programs while Kestner (2001) found that of 24 schools for the deaf surveyed (12 oral, 12 state), 67% of the oral schools and 42% of the state schools had music programs. The reasons for providing such programs are varied. Little is said about exposure to music for its own sake. Instead, studies suggest that music education can benefit children who are D/HH through improvements in auditory, speech, and social skills as well as cognitive and emotional development (Fix, 2008). However, it has been noted that research relating to music education and D/HH children has been written by hearing authors (Darrow, 1993), a population which has historically taken a paternalistic attitude towards the deaf (Padden & Humphries, 1988), suggesting that, this situation calls into question the importance of music in the lives of deaf individuals, and underscores the notion that the hearing are speaking for the deaf, perhaps erroneously, regarding this importance and the value of music in educational programs for the deaf (Darrow, 1993, p. 94). The preceding review shows clearly that while music has been used extensively in primary and secondary education, little is yet known about how best to use music in these settings. Access to these programs by D/HH students is limited and the focus of these programs seems centred on the interests of hearing educators rather than the D/HH people they serve.

4.1.2

The Importance of Music to D/HH Preteens and Adolescents

Regardless of whether a music program is available to them in their schools, for D/HH students in mainstreamed programs, music knowledge affects their day-to-day interactions with other hearing students because they are often the only D/HH student in their mainstream setting (the classroom and possibly the entire school). Oliva (2004) uses the term "solitaires" to refer to D/HH students who are alone in mainstream settings. It is estimated that approximately 15% of all D/HH students in the United States are solitaires while up to 40% of all D/HH students in the United States have few, if any, same-age peers who are also D/HH (Oliva, 2004). Thus, shared cultural information such as knowledge about a new artist is probably more important to a D/HH student's social life with hearing peers than classroom knowledge about music. 62

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

4.1. BACKGROUND

A similar phenomenon may be seen among deaf students attending a school for the deaf. For example, Medugno (2005) tells of the day his preteen deaf daughter, who attended a school for the deaf, wanted a Britney Spears CD. She wanted to fit in with the larger culture of similarly aged peers who are also fans of the same artist. Music videos are very popular among teenagers. Captioned music videos are now very common. In a randomly chosen hour of thirteen current music videos spanning 2006 to 2009 and broadcast on a dedicated music video channel, only four (30%) were not captioned. Captioned music videos started appearing in May of 1989 when American funk metal band "Living Color" decided to caption its videos. Soon, Cyndi Lauper and other artists followed suit. However, captioning was only made available when artists demanded it (D. Russell, 1989). By 1991, captioned pop music videos on dedicated cable channels (e.g., MTV) were still very rare. In Canada, YTV's Hit List, a music video television program which first aired in 1991 (Wikipedia, 2014c) was closely watched by D/HH people, because it was among the earliest such programs to provide closed captions (using roll-up captions) for every music video it featured. Perhaps unintentionally, programs like Hit List ensured that D/HH teenagers and young adults, at least in Canada, had access to important social knowledge which, until recently, was not otherwise easily available to them. Although it is now more common for televised music videos to be captioned, unfortunately, the number of music videos being televised is steadily declining in favour of videos hosted on the Internet (typically without any captioning) and viewed on demand. For example, in 2010 MuchMusic, a Canadian cable channel originally established for the broadcast of music videos, attempted to reduce the percentage of music video programming that the station showed from 50 to 25 per cent on the basis that, "music videos no longer distinguish the service as they are readily available through other sources." (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission [CRTC], 2010). These examples suggest that there is music from the larger hearing culture that similarly-aged D/HH people want to access either to fit in with their hearing peers or for other reasons. While D/HH youth have greater access to music through greater availability of captioned music videos, it is unclear whether the lyrics alone (i.e., the content of the captions) are enough, whether there is enough information available to them to feel sufficiently informed about something their hearing peers enjoy, or whether they gain any entertainment from the experience. The preceding review shows that anecdotal evidence exists that music is used extensively among D/HH youth, however, outside of captioning, little is yet known about how best to support these users.

4.1.3

The Music of the Deaf

Any study of music and D/HH people must be grounded in the context of D/HH people and the role music plays in that context. This section will explore how music is created and transmitted to D/HH people. Every culture is thought to have its own body of music, "there is no culture known to man, no single civilization of the past, that does not have its own body of music" (Hamm et al., 1975, p. 71). Darrow (1993) posits that the Deaf culture "may be the one exception" (p. 95). Although Deaf cul63

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

ture, as described by Padden and Humphries (1988), is part of the larger society, it remains relatively unknown to most of the hearing population within which it resides. Ethnocentrism, the tendency to judge other cultures in terms of one's own, can result from such a lack of knowledge. Such ethnocentrism may lead hearing researchers such as Darrow to not recognize the body music extant in the Deaf community. To understand how music is created within the Deaf community, one must realize that d/Deaf musicians create music for one of three audiences: a) other Deaf members of the community, b) d/Deaf and hearing combined audiences, and c) hearing audiences alone. The last may not be "Deaf music" at all but rather music created by a person who happens to be deaf solely within the norms and expectations of the larger hearing society. Music for Deaf Audiences Common forms of representing music for d/Deaf audiences include sign singing and dance. Sign singing, can occur in two major forms: translated songs or percussion signing (Bahan, 2006). In translated songs, the lyrics of a song are translated or adapted into a signed language and then performed for an audience. A hearing interpreter may adapt the lyrics of an oral language song into a sign language or a Deaf performing artist might express an oral language song through a sign language. Such songs may involve ritual such as singing a national anthem (Bahan, 2006). While an interpreter might attempt to map each word directly to a sign without changing word order, a performer / artist may or may not use an exact translation of the original oral song. The artist may adapt the pace so that the song is visually pleasing (Bahan, 2006). Through sign alteration and manipulation of the signing space, the artist might express pitch, timbre, and phrasing (Maler, 2013). The artist may even change the lyrics to show playfulness and creativity with the signed language (Padden & Humphries, 1988). An example of translation by d/Deaf performing artists can be found with the Deaf Performing Artists Network (D-PAN) which exists to, "create media designed specifically to serve deaf audiences through the use of American Sign Language (ASL)". This work has been widely accepted within the Deaf community for the idea and the imaginative use of new media. An example is the use of graphic effects in the D-PAN video for Christina Aguilera's "Beautiful" (D-PAN [dpanvideos], 2008). During the chorus, the sign CAPTION is used to bring words onto the screen (to interpret the line "Words can't bring me down") while the sign GO-AWAY is used to "swat" these negative words away (to interpret the line "Don't you bring me down today") (Norman, 2008). Percussion signing (sometimes called "Deaf Rap") is a form of musical expression arranged to certain beats. There are at least three types, "1, 2, 1, 2", "1, 2 - 1, 2, 3", and a combination of these two (Bahan, 2006). Deaf Rap is often accompanied by beats on a "Deaf Rap Drum", typically a large bass drum (Deaf Culture Centre, n.d.). The role of the drummer is to mark the cadence. For example, the Gallaudet University school fight song uses a "1, 2 - 1, 2, 3" beat (Padden & Humphries, 1988). In another type of percussion signing song, although its origins are unknown, a leader stands in front of a group next to a large board or sign with a list of words, and leads the group through the list 64

4.1. BACKGROUND

as they sing the song together (e.g., an example is transcribed in Padden & Humphries, 1988, p. 77). Percussion signing is popular in deaf organizations and schools for the deaf for signed performances (Deaf Culture Centre, n.d.). However, it has been suggested that the tradition of percussion signing has been dying out (Bahan, 2006; Padden & Humphries, 1988). However, my experience of percussion signing during a cultural festival, Crider's (2009) observations of percussion signing at various protests, and Tipton's (1997) documentation of hymns that are performed in ASL with a drum accompaniment, all suggest that the use of drums during sign performances is still very common. Music for Hearing Audiences Many deafened artists compose or perform music for the enjoyment of hearing audiences. Their deafness is seen as secondary to their musical expression rather than an integral part of their identity. Examples include Ludwig van Beethoven and Evelyn Glennie (Judkins, 1997). Music for Both Audiences Some deaf composers and performers actively include hearing and deaf elements into their performances making it accessible to deaf and hearing audiences alike. For example, "Beethoven's Nightmare" is an all-Deaf rock band, while Sean Forbes is one of many deaf rappers. Their musical performances include lyrics simultaneously sung in English and ASL. Deaf people produce music for the enjoyment of deaf signers, or deaf, hearing, and hard of hearing non-signers. Deaf performers are creating music, but little is being asked of what deaf people think of music, whether they enjoy it, and what value they attach to it.

4.1.4

Music and the Hard of Hearing

As discussed in Chapter 2, a HH person can be described as, "a person who has a hearing loss and whose usual means of communication is a spoken language" (Canadian Hard of Hearing Association [CHHA], 2006). This definition includes a broad spectrum of hearing loss, from those who are latedeafened to those deaf in childhood and educated orally. However, generally speaking, sign language based access to information such as music is not appropriate for HH persons since, by definition, most do not sign. Several authors have noted the presence of a HH culture (e.g., Ford, 1992; Israelite, Ower, & Goldstein, 2002) or identity (e.g., Laszlo, 1994). Like the deaf community, HH identity is taught to new members and becomes self-perpetuating. It is not a single custom or tradition but shaped by life experience. The social experiences of HH children and the definitions of the world they will form as adults are very different from that of those whose hearing loss occurs when they are seniors (McKellin, 1994). There is scant scholarly literature that makes it clear whether HH people actively enjoy music. MarkeTrak is a consumer survey that measures attitudes towards Hearing Aids (HAs) by asking for what activities a given consumer wears their HAs (Kochkin, 1990). Of the eight surveys conducted since 1989, only the last four included "Listening to music" as an item (Kochkin, 2000). One could 65

4.2. GOALS

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

suppose that, if HH people are thought to not enjoy music, consumer research in HAs would not include questions regarding music. Culturally, HH people actively try to make use of whatever residual hearing they have (Laszlo, 1994) and many HH people use HAs to support their residual hearing (Turton & Smith, 2013). However, hearing aids are known to distort music (Chasin, 2003; Chasin & Hockley, 2014). This raises the question if HH people actively enjoy music, and hearing aids negatively interfere with their enjoyment of music, would they stop listening to music or stop using HAs? It has been observed that consumer satisfaction of HAs has dropped over the past ten years leading to a high incidence of them being left "in the drawer" (Kochkin, 2000, p. 38). However, one consumer satisfaction surveys reports 77% of respondents are satisfied (9% are dissatisfied) with using their HAs while listening to music (Kochkin, 2005). Technologies such as captioned music videos or lifestyle choices such as specific genres of music (e.g., songs with deep bass or drums and few vocals) may be among the few available options for HH music consumers who cannot hear music without HAs and/or are not satisfied with the currently available hearing instruments and/or need additional information to fully enjoy the music experience. While it appears that D/HH people are doing a great deal of musical composition and performance, there seems to be little known about what D/HH people think about music and how they are consuming music. Are these consumers consuming music as sound in a manner similar to hearing audiences or are they consuming music in some other manner? Usually survey research intended to reflect the lives of D/HH people focuses on the opinions of others (e.g., teachers, audiologists, social workers, parents, etc.) rather than the opinions of those being discussed (Lane, 1992). The research presented in this chapter will achieve some understanding of the experience(s) of music by D/HH adults in their own words. This chapter presents the results of an online study aimed at collecting initial attitudinal and experiential data on music appreciation from D/HH people. In addition, it reports on people's experience with school programs and the influence that this has had on their attitudes towards music.

4.2

Goals

The goal of the study presented in this chapter is to answer the following questions: 1. Are efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH wanted? 2. If so, (a) what types of information would be considered useful? (b) what might be the desired form for presenting it?

Method

The study reported in this chapter was part of a larger study that evaluated the usability of music captioned via animated text (Mori & Fels, 2009; Vy et al., 2008). The larger study consisted of four parts: a) completing a Pre-experiment Questionnaire, b) watching a Video, c) completing a Post-experiment Questionnaire, and d) completing a Music Questionnaire. This chapter describes and discusses the results of the fourth part, the Music Questionnaire. To provide context, the remainder of this section will describe the method of the entire study and conclude with a summary description of the participants.

4.4.1

Pre-experiment Questionnaire

In the first part of the larger study, participants were asked to visit a webpage using their own computer and preferred browser. After consenting to participate, participants were asked five demographic and pre-experiment questions to determine their hearing identity (hearing, hard of hearing, or deaf), gender, age range, highest level of education completed, and frequency of using captions when watching television.

4.4.2

Video

In the second part, participants were asked to watch one of two different prototype videos with animated lyrics. One of the prototype videos, Forgive Me, had lead and background singers that required differentiation on screen. The lead singer's lyrics were displayed in a light blue 32 point (pt) font and placed in the upper left area of the screen. The background singers' lyrics were indicated in a yellow 22 pt font and placed in the lower right area of the screen. It was possible that the lyrics of the lead and background singers could appear simultaneously on the screen. All lyrics were presented against a black background and timed to appear on the screen as they were sung in the song. The other prototype

68

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

4.4. METHOD

video, Family Snapshot, had one singer whose lyrics were presented in a white 22 pt font against a black background and were timed to appear as they were sung in the song. The video presented to the participant was selected randomly by a randomizer embedded in the webpage. The lyrics were animated to indicate various emotions (e.g., happy, angry). No sound accompanied the lyrics. To not bias participants who may or may not be knowledgeable or interested in music, participants were only told that they would be watching a video. This avoided referring to the animated lyrics as "songs."

4.4.3

Post-experiment Questionnaire

After participants viewed one of these prototype videos, they moved to the third part where they were asked to complete a seventeen-item questionnaire about their understanding of the video and their opinion of the various caption elements (e.g., colour, movement, and position on screen). At the end of this questionnaire, participants were told that the video used lyrics from a musical recording.

4.4.4

Music Questionnaire

In the fourth part, participants were asked to share their "attitude and experience with music" and provide their opinions on specific topics. As shown in Section 4.3 on page 67, using forced-choice questions, this six-item Music Questionnaire asked how frequently participants listened to music, the extent they enjoyed music, what technologies they used to listen to music (e.g., radio, MP3 player, etc.), what kinds of music information they were interested in, and their experience of music, if any, in their elementary and secondary schools. These questions were asked for several reasons. Asking how often a participant listens to music provides information on whether the participant is a consumer of music and the degree which they believe they engage with music. The question on the extent a person enjoyed music was asked to determine the respondent's general attitude toward music. Participants were asked to identify the technologies they use when listening to music to learn several things about them such as what technologies they prefer to use (since some technologies are more useful depending on a person's degree of hearing loss), whether they are consumers of music presenting technologies, and whether certain technologies are more likely to be used by members of the D/HH communities than others. The question asking what kind of music information participants would think is most useful as well as how this information might be represented visually used a table where each row was a type of information (lyrics, notes, instruments, beat, music speed, emotion, artist information, and song title) and each column was a type of representation (text, graphics, animation, icons, don't care). Participants were able to select, via checkboxes, as many responses as they wished. The fifth question asked participants whether experience of music in school was positive or negative. This item is intended to gauge whether a negative / positive school music experience may have had impact on later music enjoyment / engagement as well as provide respondents with an opportunity to consider their early experiences with music. 69

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

Each question was followed with an opportunity to provide further comments in an open-ended form. The sixth question was open-ended and asked for any final comments the participant wanted to express.

4.4.5

Participants

The survey was online for one week. There were 14 HH (3 males, 11 females) and 28 deaf (10 males, 18 females) participants. All of the participants but three reported watching captions "All the time" when watching television (one HH respondent reported occasionally watching captions, one deaf and one HH respondent reported never watching captions). Participants ranged in age from 19 to over 65 (median 45-54). The median age range for HH participants was 55-64 while that of deaf participants was 45-54. Of the two prototype videos, 23 participants saw Forgive Me (8 HH, 15 deaf) while 19 viewed Family Snapshot (6 HH, 13 deaf).

Table 4.2: What statement describes you best? (by hearing identity) As shown in Table 4.2, of the 40 participants who responded to the question "What statement describes you best?", most D/HH participants responded that they either really enjoy (13 or 33%) or like (15 or 38%) music. Specifically, 17 deaf participants (42% of overall, 63% of the deaf) reported that they like or enjoy listening to music. Conversely, 3 participants (8%), 2 deaf and 1 HH, reported that they "do not see the point of music". Selected comments: Â· "I used to love listening to music. Wish they would add captioning to all music videos on DVD all the time." Â· "I am deaf." Â· "A day without music is like a day without sunshine to me!" Â· "no comment. I can't hear. :)" Table 4.3 reviews the data in Table 4.2 in terms of respondents who really enjoy or like music.

Goal 2 Â­ What information is needed?

As shown in Section 4.3 on page 67, the Music Questionnaire asked participants what kind of music information they would think is most useful and how they thought this information might be best visually represented. Participants were provided with eight types of music information (lyrics, notes, instruments, beat, music speed, emotion, artist information, and song title) and five categories for representing music information (text, graphics, animation, icons and don't care). With respect to the five categories for representing music information, an initial analysis of the results suggested that the participants were confused with the difference between the terms "icon" and "graphic", and seemed to think of those two concepts as similar. Thus, the categories "icon" and a "graphic" were combined. Table 4.8 on the next page shows the frequency of participant's different preferences for representing music information. Selected comments: Â· "A question Â­ In this case, what is the difference between a graphic and an icon?" Â· "I like when songs are captioned in text in italic writing with the music notes. However, I wish there was sometimes a little more info on the beats and rhythm." Â· "Not sure" Â· "most deafers don't care on music name/songs" Â· "Deaf people like loud bass than high pitch because it is feeling vibration." Â· "I am not knowledgeable about music, just find it relaxing." A contingency table analysis was carried out to examine whether there is any relationship between how participants wanted music information presented and the type of music information. The result is shown in Table 4.8. A chi-square test for independence was conducted to determine if there is any relationship between the participant's preferred form of representing music information and the type of music information to be represented. 75

Table 4.13: Frequency results representation of song title by gender. A chi-square test for independence was conducted to determine if there is any relationship between the participant's reports of how they wanted beat information represented and the video they had just seen. H0 : Participant's reports of how they wanted beat information represented and the video they had just seen are independent. Ha : Participant's reports of how they wanted beat information represented and the video they had just seen are not independent. There is a statistically significant relationship in participants' reports of how they wanted beat information represented and the video they had just seen, X 2 (3, N = 37) = 8.556, p = 0.036. Since the p -value is less than the significance level (0.05), we cannot accept the null hypothesis. Viewers of Family Snapshot were more likely to indicate a desire for text or graphics whereas viewers of Forgive Me expressed a preference for animation. A chi-square test for independence was conducted to determine if there is any relationship between the participant's reports of how they wanted speed of the music represented and the video they had just seen.

Discussion
Goal 1 Â­ Are efforts to improve accessibility desired?

To determine whether efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH are wanted, there is a need to understand whether D/HH people are active consumers of music. There was no significant difference in participants' frequency of listening to music based on their hearing identity. Table 4.1 on page 71 shows the frequency of hearing identity and how much the participant listens to music. Regardless of hearing identity, 35 of the 42 D/HH participants (83%) who responded to this item reported listening to music. However, their comments suggest their reasons for doing so may not always be related to entertainment. As one deaf participant commented, "music helps me to relax." Since D/HH people do use music to manage the effects of tinnitus (e.g., Tyler, 2006), we can expect to see reports of this use of music by this population. One HH participant commented, "Music tunes out my tinnitus." As shown in Table 4.2 on page 71, of the 40 participants who responded to the question "What statement describes you best?", most D/HH participants responded that they either really enjoy (13 or 33%) or like (15 or 38%) music. Specifically, 17 deaf participants (42% of overall, 63% of the deaf) reported that they like or enjoy listening to music. Conversely, 3 participants (8%), 2 deaf and 1 HH, stated that they "do not see the point of music". As one deaf participant noted, "I am deaf." Darrow (1993) found that 46.8% of respondents who identified with Deaf culture considered music "Not at all" important yet, as Stewart notes, "many [deaf] people do love music, even if they can't hear much of it" (1990, as cited in Darrow, 1993). As shown in, Table 4.5 on page 73, when participants were asked how they most often listened to music, responses were quite varied. Interestingly, four deaf participants (14% of 37 respondents) reported using mobile music players such as iPods, Walkmans, etc. to listen to music. This suggests a market exists for mobile players among the D/HH. Music players that support video might prove very useful for D/HH users who want visual information as well as auditory music. Some of the comments deaf participants provided to the question of how they most often listened to music went beyond the question. One pointed out, "loud at airshows and motorsports I love." While another said, "Like the feeling of vibration." For the deaf, "hearing" is simply another sense of touch (Glennie, n.d.). As mentioned in Section 4.1.1 on page 61, many deaf children do not have access to any music education programs and some choose not to take music classes. This experience could impact a person's use of music. Table 4.6 on page 74 shows the majority of D/HH participants took some sort of music education and, in general, they report having had a positive experience. According to Table 4.7 on page 74, even if they had a negative school experience, participants still tended to report enjoying music. Comments provided by participants help to explore their experiences. One deaf participant in this study commented that, "I did not take any music classes because I was not able to hear the notes or the sound of music." A deaf person who had a somewhat positive experience reported that "rhythm class was fun some79

4.6. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

times." Similarly, one of the youngest deaf participants reported a very positive experience, saying "They used American Sign Language and facial [expressions] while they sang." One participant's very negative experience led to the comment that, "As a hard of hearing person, it was very difficult and awkward for me to participate in mandatory music classes. I wasn't able to hear the words or follow what was going on." Similarly, a deaf participant who found their music program very negative said, "I was told to stop singing. I sensed that my music teacher really hated me as she gave so much body language!" There were a number of gender differences identified in the results. For example, D/HH women reported a higher frequency of listening to music with 45% of women reporting a daily or weekly frequency compared to 31% of men. Conversely, 38% of men reported "Never" listening to music compared to 7% of women. Women were also more likely to report that they liked music. While it is possible that these results may be an important gender difference, they may be an artifact of the more than twice as many female participants than male participants in this study.

4.6.2

Goal 2 Â­ What information is needed?

As mentioned in Chapter 1, Principle Four of the Principles of Universal Design, "Perceptible Information", requires the design to communicate necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities and encourages using different modalities (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile) to redundantly present essential information. Determining what types of music information would be considered useful would be supportive of the Principles of Universal Design. To help determine what types of music information would be considered useful and what might be the desired form for presenting it, participants were asked about how they would like to see music displayed and the kinds of information they would want to see. Table 4.8 shows the majority of participants had a strong preference for text to be used for lyrics (32 of 38 participants or 84%), song title (30 of 40 participants or 75%) and artist information (27 of 37 participants or 73%). It is very likely that this response is a reflection of the fact that this information is normally available in text and participants seem to accept this and want this information presented as text. While the majority of D/HH participants indicated a preference for using text to represent lyrics, three of the 25 deaf participants (12%) specifically suggested animation to represent lyrics while another three responded "don't care". This suggests a preference among deaf participants for a culturally appropriate non-text representation of lyrics. In their comments, one deaf participant suggested using a sign language video to represent lyrics while another suggested including a sign translation in the corner of the screen. These ideas require caution since, as mentioned in Chapter 2, most HH people do not sign. Another interpretation for the expressed preference for animation may be that this response is an effect of having just seen lyrics containing animated text earlier in the study. However, several participants completed the open-ended question by commenting directly on the captions they saw. Many specifically complained about the use of colour and animated effects in the captions. 80

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

4.6. DISCUSSION

Three of 37 participants selected icons/graphics (8%), and one selected animation (3%) to present the artist information. No one made any suggestions of what an animated or graphic display of this information might contain. For example, a picture of the artist, album artwork, or some type of logo could be used. The remaining participants (6 of 37) selected "Don't care" (16%). Five participants did not respond to this item. Four of 40 participants selected icons/graphics (15%) and two deaf participants selected animation (5%) to represent song title. Again, no suggestions were made. One participant comments, "most deafers don't care on music name/songs" The remaining four participants selected "Don't care" (10%). Two participants left the item blank. The majority of participants (16 of 37 or 43%) wanted beat/rhythm to be represented by animation. Ten participants (27%) wanted it represented by graphics/icons, seven (19%) wanted it represented using text, and four participants (11%), three of whom had seen the Forgive Me video, did not care how it was represented. Five participants of the total (12%) did not answer this question. One HH participant commented, "I wish there was sometimes a little more info on the beats and rhythm." Thus, this music information is desired, preferably in some non-textual form. If we examine the descriptive information, there are some noteworthy trends. Twelve of 32 participants (38%) selected "Don't care" for how music notes should be represented. Ten (24%) participants left the item blank. Six of 32 participants preferred text (19%), and 9 of 32 preferred icons/graphics (28%). Given that the majority of participants (22) either gave no response or indicated they "Don't care" how music notes should be represented, there seems to be less interest in note information than other forms of music information. However, as one HH participant commented, "I like when songs are captioned in text, in italic writing with the music notes." The traditional representation of music in closed captioning is text with a music note icon. Italics are often used to indicate an off-screen singer. The majority of D/HH participants indicated a desire for instrument information. However, the 37 responding participants were split on whether to use text (9 of 37 or 24%), graphics/icons (16 or 43%), or animations (3 or 8%) with the remainder selecting "Don't care" (9 or 24%). More study is needed to understand how much instrument information D/HH consumers want. In terms of how they wanted speed of the music represented, 11 of 32 participants selected animation (34%), 9 selected graphics/icons (28%), 7 selected text (22%), and 5 (three of whom had seen the Forgive Me video) selected "Don't care" (16%). This was also the one item that was the most ignored since more participants (24% of all participants) left it blank than any other item. Where a response was provided, animation slightly edged out all the others. This result suggests that either speed of the music may be a less important type of music information to provide, or this item was poorly understood. Animation was also the preferred approach for representing emotion. Ten of 35 participants selected animation to show emotion (29%), 9 expressed an interest in using text to show emotion (26%), and 8 participants selected graphics/icons (23%) while another 8 selected "Don't care" (23%). The remaining participants left the item blank. Several gender differences were noted. Tables 4.10 to 4.13 show the response frequencies resulting from these chi-squared analyzes presented in Table 4.9. Women showed a strong preference for the 81

4.6. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

use of text to represent lyrics, artist information, and song title as well as a strong preference for the use of animation for the representation of rhythm and beat information. It is possible this result is a reflection of the large number of female participants, but it is reported here because it may be an important gender difference. As reflected from their comments, for a few of the participants, this study led to some very deep thinking. A participant who used to actively compose music and play the piano prior to her hearing loss stated, "I deeply miss that experience." Perhaps a comment by one deaf participant is most illustrative of the concerns and experiences surrounding music raised by participants, I wish very much I could understand music. I wish I had a person who could talk to me about music and explain and answer my questions. Some voices are literally thrilling to listen to. I wish I could identify the instruments. I wish I knew what people talk about when they discuss music. I wish I could sing, or play an instrument myself. I like to watch captioned movies that talk about composers and their works. I have met people who are able to tell which CONDUCTOR is playing a piece! [I have also met] many who can identify who is singing a piece on the radio, or what the music is etc. I would love to see more TV programs that have captions to tell, who it is, what they are playing etc etc and more history about the piece.

4.6.3

Limitations of the Design

The analysis of the data suggests at least five limitations of this study, three of which are related to questionnaire design. First, the questionnaire design was not able to investigate combinations of different methods to represent information. For example, animation and text could be combined to present a song title in a sign language as well as text. Second, there may be some mix up in the participant's understanding of "animation". Since the study presents animated captions, a selection of "Animation" may in fact be a preference for animated captions or equally a preference for some other type of moving graphic (e.g., a sign video). Thus, both possible definitions were taken into account when interpreting the data. A third limitation of this design is that while asking how to represent music information, the Music Questionnaire did not also ask for some ranking of the importance of each type of information. As a result this must be extrapolated from the responses. For example, it can be suggested that the information is important when a preference is specified and it can be suggested that there is no importance when a participant responds, "Don't care" or ignores the item and leaves it blank. However, any conclusion that is more specific cannot be established based on this data. Alternatively, given the wording of question 4 in the Music Questionnaire (i.e., "If information about music from film, television, and radio could be displayed, what would be useful to have and what form would be best?"), if a participant responded "Don't care" or ignored the item and left it blank, it may be interpreted as the question suggests as not "useful".

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

4.7. CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY

Also, there are few if any examples of meaningful graphics used in music or animation, etc., so it may be hard for D/HH consumers to imagine the possibilities for representing music information visually. The small sample size with an unequal number of men and women is another limitation. The chisquare test for independence is sensitive to sample size as well as small expected frequencies in one or more of the cells in the table. For these reasons caution must be taken in interpreting chi-square if one or more cells are less than 5. However, according to Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero, "There is no hard-and-fast rule regarding the size of expected frequencies." (2011, p. 350). Most researchers limit the use of chi-square to tables that either a) have no expected frequencies values below 5 or b) have no more than 20 percent of the expected frequencies values below 5 (Frankfort-Nachmias & Leon-Guerrero, 2011). Finally, the complexity of the larger experiment within which this survey was performed may have confounded the results. Recall that the Music Questionnaire was a small subset of the larger study. Participants completed a demographics survey, then watched one of two videos which was randomly assigned, and then completed a series of post test questions based on the video they watched all before completing the Music Questionnaire. There may have been a presentation effect with respect to the video presented. There was a relationship in participants' reports of how they wanted beat information represented and the video they had just seen where viewers of Family Snapshot were more likely to indicate a desire for text or graphics whereas viewers of Forgive Me expressed a preference for animation. There was also a relationship in participants' reports of how they wanted speed of the music represented and the video they had just seen where viewers of Forgive Me were more likely to indicate a desire for text or graphics whereas viewers of Family Snapshot expressed a preference for animation.

4.7

Conclusions From This Study

Recall the research questions explored in this chapter were: 1. Are efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH wanted? 2. If so, what types of information would be considered useful and what might be the desired form for presenting this music information? In answer to the question of whether efforts to create accessible music information are wanted, the responses of D/HH participants strongly support the notion that they actively seek music and enjoy the experience. Few reported having no interest in music. Some participants found the study very interesting and reported a desire to see more. At the same time, reflecting the poverty of using captions alone to visualize music, one participant stated, "As a Deaf person, I do not particularly care about music being conveyed through captions." However, consistent with Principle One of the Principles of Universal Design, "Equitable use", visualizations of music cannot exclude the auditory experience. Many of the D/HH participants in this

83

4.7. CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY

CHAPTER 4. NEED FOR THE WORK

study reported listening to music, not just having an interest in the lyrics. Yet, as one deafened participant said, "I find most music a screeching mishmash of Chinese-sounding (no offense, please) incomprehensibilities." There is a need to find that balance, which differs for each individual, between noise and entertainment. In answer to the question as to what types of information would be considered useful and what might be the desired form for presenting this music information, there is also great individual difference. Participants in this study showed a clear interest in lyrics, song information, instruments, and rhythm / beat. There appeared to be less interest in notes or the speed of music. There may be only limited interest in information about the emotions being expressed. These findings need further investigation to best meet the needs of D/HH consumers and may indicate a need to combine different forms of representation to visualize specific music information. The responses and comments provided by participants make clear that D/HH adults do not feel that their needs are met by current music captioning approaches. D/HH captioning consumers do not want to just see a musical note or the title of a song. As one deaf participant said, "It's annoying when a song that is TWENTY YEARS OLD Â­ just for an example, isn't fully captioned. How hard can it be to look up lyrics THAT OLD?" That said, captions of the lyrics alone, are not enough, as this study shows, other information must be included. For example, the comments of at least one participant suggested that the reason why the piece is being used is just as important as the musical information. Describing the use of music in television programs and movies, the participant wanted to know, "more history about the piece." As mentioned earlier, usually survey research intended to reflect the lives of D/HH people focus on the opinions of others (e.g., teachers, audiologists, social workers, parents, etc.) rather than the opinions of those being discussed. In particular, the hearing seem to be speaking for the deaf with regards to the importance and value of music to the Deaf community (e.g., Darrow, 1993). The responses of the participants of the larger study included comments such as "such an interesting survey" and "Thanks for your study and consideration." show that D/HH adults want to be asked what they think about music and how they consume / access it. Past research showed an ulterior motive, whether acknowledged or not, in understanding the way to present music to D/HH children. Researchers continue to focus on children and the "benefits" of music education to speech and oral language skill development. Little discussion occurs regarding access to music for its own sake. This study joins the ranks of the very few (e.g., Brokaw, 1997; Darrow, 1993) which have explored the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of D/HH adults regarding music. While there has been recent attention on the issue of music and the D/HH communities by D/HH authors (e.g., Crider, 2009), more attention is needed to understand the needs of each population with respect to access to music information. It is interesting that participants did not mention existing music visualizations used by music playing software such as Windows Media Player. Such visualizations employ an abstract art approach which may or may not provide any meaningful information to a D/HH consumer. Future work could determine their usability for D/HH music consumers and explore the role, if any, such visualizations may play for D/HH music consumers. Chapters 5, 6 and 8 describe experiments that present such vi84

Future work could take the shape of further surveys specific to their experiences of music or focus groups that explore different music visualization possibilities as well as consumer opinions.

4.8

Next Steps

The work reported in this chapter fills in some of the gaps created by the lack of literature on the issue of music and the D/HH communities. In particular it shows that members of the D/HH communities actively seek out and enjoy music. It shows the need for the current project and represents part of the scoping required by DRM Stage 0. As shown in Figure 4.2, the four parts of the experiment discussed in this chapter represent the full DRM cycle because it introduced an intervention, the exposure of the participants to the videos, and measured key parameters in their appreciation of music. The next chapter describes a focus group conducted to evaluate various music visualizations. The visualizations were selected to be consistent with the scoping work reported in this chapter. As such, the focus group work qualifies as a DRM Stage 1 (Descriptive Study I) activity, which provides a baseline of critical parameters in a situation into which some design intervention will be eventually introduced.

Chapter 5

Focus Group I
Music content can be so powerful that it may carry long-term cultural significance (Fourney & Fels, 2008). For example, many North American adults closely associate the main shark theme from the movie "Jaws", a simple alternating pattern of the notes E and F (Matessino, 1999, Sept. 24), with images of an attacking shark and the anticipation of doom, even if the music is not being used in the context of sharks. This chapter considers one possible solution to creating access for D/HH audiences to this cultural information and entertainment medium: making music visual. For any prototype visualization of music to be successful, it needs to convey the sense of music, its rhythm, melody, emotional content, and overall entertainment. Ultimately, the experience should be similar to that enjoyed through sound except that the means of enjoyment would be different. If the song is intended to be soothing, or invigorating, or melancholic, or joyful, then it should be perceived as such. As previously discussed in Section 2.5.4 on page 32, the visual modality has several strengths that make it ideal for exploring the presentation of music information: Â· Human visual resolution is stronger than human auditory resolution (Kramer, 1994). Â· Very large amounts of information can be presented on a screen while the transient nature of sound requires their discrete presentation (Kramer, 1994). Â· The visual system of deaf adults may monitor their peripheral visual field more than hearing adults (Bavelier et al., 2006). Â· Screens represent a mature, cheap, portable, nearly ubiquitous technology. In this chapter, different options for music visualization are explored towards determining what music information could be visualized and appropriately convey the experience and meaningfulness of music. This chapter presents the results of a focus group with D/HH users who viewed these various options and provided their expectations for visualized music. Portions of this chapter appear in Fourney and Fels (2009). 87

5.1. BACKGROUND

CHAPTER 5. FOCUS GROUP I

5.1

Background

As mentioned in Chapter 2, music is a combination of rhythm, pitch, timing, timbre, and texture. Its performance can range from a strictly organized composition to improvisations. Each culture has its own definition of music and methods of expression. Music has elements which listeners find pleasing and enjoyable. Music is often perceived as primarily an aural experience especially for recorded music. However, there are tactile and visual components of music that can enhance or complement the overall music experience such as feeling the drum beat or watching the movements of the performers (band members, instrumentalists, vocalists) or dance accompaniment. Live performance is particularly exemplary of the use of visual and tactile enhancements. For example, live performances often involve dancing, or transmission of vibration through the floor from the percussion instruments. Recording and reproducing such live performances removes this additional information from the experience and changes the focus of musical entertainment to one that is exclusively aural. This focus excludes D/HH people from participation. Music videos have returned some of the visual elements of live performances but they are not intended to increase the accessibility of the music. Music videos appear to be more oriented to marketing the product or boosting the "image" of the artist (Straw, 1988) than visually conveying the artist's own interpretation of the music. The lyrics in combination with the instruments, rhythm, melody, harmony, volume and tempo together provide an emotional effect. In addition, while music can act at an emotional level in humans, "to move people" (Toland, 2001), it can also be consumed in the background as a more pleasant auditory stimuli and more positive effect on their emotional level than what is currently in people's environment (e.g., car noise, the neighbour's lawn mower). One of the issues then is how the receptive experience of music information can be made more accessible to D/HH people in a way that creates enjoyable experiences. The next section presents the different visualization options used in the present study and outlines their properties.

Goals

The goal of the study presented in this chapter is to answer the following questions: 1. Are efforts to improve accessibility desired? 2. How do viewers respond to specific visualizations?

Method
Step 1

In advance of the focus group, instrumental-only versions of 15 popular songs thirty seconds long were assessed by a group of four hearing people for the overall emotion each clip represented (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear). If these informants all agreed on the emotion the song represented, it was included in the set of songs to be presented to the focus group.

5.4.2

Step 2

Five different displays (iTunes, MPM, MAM Piano Roll display, MAM Part Motion display, and MAM Tonal Compass display) created from three different visualization tools (Music Animation Machine, iTunes, and Motion Pixels of Music) were used to create a total of 18 prototype visualizations of eight different popular music tracks. The list of songs used is presented in Table 5.1. The resulting prototypes were presented to D/HH participants in a focus group setting. To capture the individual experience as well as the larger group comments multiple tools were used to collect participant's responses to the prototypes. After each prototype was shown, participants were asked for their opinions about the visualization using a discussion format as well as the Post-visualization Questionnaire shown in Figure 5.2. Participants also completed a pre-study questionnaire to gather information about their music experiences as well as a post-study questionnaire to summarize their opinions of the music visualization experience. Since different D/HH people have different levels of hearing and different abilities to process whatever sound they can hear, the songs were presented without sound to control for variation of hearing

Visualizations

Music Animation Machine The first visualization tool was the Music Animation Machine (MAM). As described in Chapter 2, it provides various visualizations of real-time music data based on MIDI file input. MAM was used to produce three different displays: Piano Roll, Part Motion (Balls), and Tonal Compass (Malinowski, n.d.). Magnetosphere As described in Chapter 2, the default visualizer of the iTunes media player application provides visualizations based on waveform analysis of the audio input. Since the visual parameters of such visualizations tend to be completely arbitrary (Lipscomb & Kim, 2004). Motion Pixels of Music Recognizing that the visualizations provided by the above two visualizers do not present all the properties of music provided in other visualizations (i.e., lyrics, tonality, harmony, loudness, pitch, and timing), the Motion Pixels of Music (MPM) visualization was specifically developed for this study. The MPM provides information on tonality, harmony, pitch and timing as well as showing the instrumentation present, and beat / rhythm information. The visualization uses real-time music data based on MIDI file input. It can individually display all sixteen MIDI channels, where available. While lyrics can be accommodated in this tool, no lyrics were used in this study. This visualization has two ways of depicting note duration: decay the animation outward or decay the animation inward. In the outward mode, shown in Figure 5.4, the note appears to continue to move out toward the edge of the MPM. In the inward mode the note appears to fall back to its origin. Tempo or beat stimuli is represented using a cluster of circles that use a wave effect. Four of the circles in the cluster represent the cymbals (top most), high hat (leftmost), snare drum (centre circle), bass drum (largest circle) as common percussion instruments, and the fifth circle represents any fifth percussive instrument (e.g., tambourine, kettle drum, etc.). Table 5.2 shows the common types of musical information each of these visualizations can display. Some visualizations are unique in displaying specific information (e.g., Magnetosphere displays amplitude, MPM displays instrumentation). It is not clear if any of these five visualizations (iTunes, MPM, MAM Piano Roll display, MAM Part Motion display, and MAM Tonal Compass display) were explicitly designed to communicate emotions.

Stimuli and Their Properties

Instrumental-only versions of eight popular songs representing four different emotions (i.e., two songs each representing one of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear) were randomly presented, without sound, for thirty seconds in either one or two of the above visualization techniques (i.e., iTunes, MPM, MAM Piano Roll display, MAM Part Motion display, and MAM Tonal Compass display). These specific visualization tools were selected because they were representative of the variation (e.g., using pitch, timbre and tempo in Piano Roll, tonality in Tonal Compass, frequency and amplitude for iTunes, and tonality, harmony, pitch, tempo, timbre and beat for MPM) that is available according to the literature. Since the MPM visualization relies on MIDI information, it can only display the instruments coded into the MIDI file. Showing all sixteen channels when only a few have any information could impact the usability of the visualization. As a result, depending on which song was playing, the MPM visualization would show either a small number of MIDI channels (e.g., four or eight) or a very large number of MIDI channels (e.g., all sixteen). This variation was used to elicit responses on the amount of information that can be tolerated by viewers. Songs were played either once or twice (i.e., each emotion had between two and four presentations). When a song was presented in two ways, one was always a MPM presentation. To help ensure they were not influenced by predisposition / familiarity with certain applications, the title bar of the application was always hidden from participants' view. After each presentation, participants completed a 7-item questionnaire about the emotional impact (ratings of discrete emotions such as fear, anger, happy and sad, and arousal/valence), level of enjoyment, and opinions of the visualization they had just seen. After all 18 visualizations were shown, participants then completed the post-study questionnaire and participated in a follow-up discussion.

Participants

The focus group had 10 participants: five deaf (three male, two female), one deafened (female) and four HH (female). One deaf male also identified himself as a Cochlear Implant (CI) user. Participants ranged in age from 25 to over 65 (4 were 25-34, 1 was 35-44, 2 were 45-54, 2 were 55-64, and 1 was 65+). Nine participants indicated always using closed captions when watching television. One indicated only using captions "sometimes". Three participants reported high school or some technical college as their highest level of formal education. The remaining seven were university graduates, three reported completing graduate school.

Table 5.5: Music experience in school (by hearing identity). Participants were asked which visualization style gave them "the best sense of what was happening in the music". The results of this question are shown in Table 5.8. Table 5.9 on page 99 shows the contingency table of most enjoyed visualization and the visualization participants selected as giving the best sense of the music. H0 : Participant's most enjoyed visualization and the visualization selected as giving the best sense of the music are independent. Ha : Participant's most enjoyed visualization and the visualization selected as giving the best sense of the music are not independent. There was a statistically significant association between a participant's enjoyment of a particular visualization and their choice of which one gave the best sense of music X 2 (6, N = 10) = 16.786, p = 0.01. Since the p -value is less than the significance level (0.05), we cannot accept the null hypothesis. Participants who indicated the iTunes visualization in the one category would also choose it in the other At the end of the focus group, participants were asked What Was Most Enjoyable? Selected comments " What Was Most Enjoyable? ": Â· "Feeling positive of the visualized beats" Â· "colors and instrument with melody" Â· "looking at the changing colors" Â· "some of them are good" Â· "lots of color" Â· "nothing really - need to connect music" 97

Discussion
Goal 1 Â­ Are efforts to improve accessibility desired?

To determine whether efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH are wanted, there is a need to understand whether D/HH people are active consumers of music. Participants of this focus group responded even more favourably to music than was shown in Chapter 4. For example, Table 5.3 on page 96 shows the contingency table of hearing identity and how much the participant listens to music. Three deaf participants reported listening to music "weekly" or "daily". Two reported listening to music "rarely". The remaining participants reported listening to music "sometimes". Similarly, Table 5.4 on page 96 shows participant's responses to the question "What statement describes you best?" While one HH participant reported neutral feelings towards music enjoyment, all other participants either "liked listening to music" (2 deaf, 2 HH) or "really enjoyed listening to music" (1 HH, 3 deaf, 1 deafened). No one responded "I do not like listening to music." or "I do not see the point of music." Given that the recruiting materials for this focus group specifically mentioned music, it is likely that the participants self-selected on this item. In other words, it is unlikely, given the recruiting materials, that a person who might respond "I do not like listening to music." or "I do not see the point of music." would have attended this focus group. Thus, similar to Chapter 4, in answer to the question of whether efforts to create accessible music information are wanted, the responses of D/HH participants strongly support the notion that they actively seek music and enjoy the experience. No one reported having no interest in music. Some participants found the study very interesting and reported a desire to see more. 100

CHAPTER 5. FOCUS GROUP I

5.6. DISCUSSION

The next section presents and discusses the responses to the different visualizations from the participants of the focus group.

5.6.2

Goal 2 Â­ How do viewers respond to specific visualizations?

As mentioned in Chapter 1, Principle Three, "Simple and intuitive use", implies that the user interface of any visualization solution should be obvious. In the case of music visualization, this principle would suggest that the visualization itself should be simple and intuitive, even without sound. Similarly, Principle Four of the Principles of Universal Design, "Perceptible Information", requires the design to communicate necessary information effectively to the user. Determining what types of music information would be considered useful and whether specific visualization styles communicated such information in a intuitive manner would be supportive of the Principles of Universal Design. As shown in Table 5.6 on page 98, when participants were asked which visualization style gave them the "best" sense of drums / percussion, instruments playing, melody, or rhythm, their responses were mixed. Participants found that MPM (5) gave the best sense of percussion in the outward fans view. The iTunes (3) visualization was also preferred for percussion. Two participants selected "none". Participants found that the Piano Roll (3) visualization gave the best sense of instruments playing while the Part Motion (4) visualization gave the best sense of the melody. Participants were split on the best visualization for rhythm choosing MPM in the outward fans configuration (3), Piano Roll (3), and Part Motion (3). There was a considerable quantity of rich qualitative data collected during the focus group. These results did not always agree with the data presented in Table 5.6. The summary discussion provided the best overview of the participants' experience and enjoyment levels for all of the different displays. When asked at the end of the focus group session which visualization they enjoyed most, all but two participants said they preferred the iTunes visualization. Two HH female participants preferred the MAM Part Motion visualization as their most enjoyed. One participant did not make any selection. Two (1 HH female, 1 deafened female) participants indicated that the Part Motion visualization gave them the best sense of what was happening in the music, but they enjoyed the iTunes visualization most. One HH female participant indicated that the MAM Tonal Compass visualization gave them the best sense of what was happening in the music, but preferred the Part Motion visualization overall. The remaining six participants selected the iTunes visualization as providing the best sense of music. One participant did not make any selection. Results for the other visualizations were not surprising; for example, Malinowski (n.d.) suggested that the MAM Piano Roll display, "is no more interesting to deaf people than it is to hearing people when they watch it with the sound turned off". The results of the focus group bear this out, the Piano Roll was essentially meaningless without the sound or some explanation of what was happening. This suggests that such visualizations are deficient when unaccompanied by sound and that certain aspects of the perception of sound are not represented in the MAM visualizations (Malinowski, n.d.). 101

5.6. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 5. FOCUS GROUP I

The MAM Tonal Compass view was equally uninteresting. Participants could not relate to what the visualization was trying to show. The MPM visualization, which was considered more informative and more clearly indicated how the song might sound, was described by participants as "boring" and too visually busy / taxing. Participants openly complained about the visualization when presented with a white background. Using a black background made the colours appear sharper; however, there was no improvement in music understanding or entertainment. This suggests that there is a need to make this visualization more interesting, perhaps through visual design. It also suggests a need to completely rethink the approach. Participants wanted to see the "more vibrant" visualizations. As one participant said, the iTunes visualization "was visually appealing and uplifting." However, this visualization was the least meaningful and only presents information based on a waveform analysis. The result suggests that D/HH viewers were not so interested in how accurately the visualization represents the music, but how entertaining the resulting representation appears. This result was not surprising since non-D/HH music consumers listen to music for entertainment, not analysis. It is interesting that the emotional connection with visualizations, particularly the iTunes visualization, is that of wanting an "uplifting" experience regardless of the emotional intention of the music. Interpreting these types of statements as people expressing the desire to only consume uplifting or positive experiences from music visualizations would be presumptuous and likely inaccurate. However, is the expectation of music visualization to be a moving experience which may sometimes be uplifting or may also be sad and just as moving or emotional? Further research is required to better understand people's expectation of a musical experience. The fact that, according to Table 5.7, two participants found the MAM Part Motion view enjoyable also suggests some direction for future work. While users want to be entertained, simple representations that communicate a sense of what is happening in the music might still prove useful, especially if combined with entertaining views. Participants also found that they, "could not really connect" to the different visualizations. They could not see how music was represented. As one pointed out, the "music was not conveyed well." This further suggests that something was missing in the visual representation. Beyond the need to identify the properties of music which people find entertaining, there is a need to capture that part of music which people internalize. The hope is that a future visual representation would have a response such as, "this is how I would imagine music to look." Two female participants (1 HH, 1 deaf) commented that the visualizations were presented without sound suggesting the presence of sound would have made some difference. Given that participants had difficulty connecting music to the visualization, using sound as an accompaniment to the visualization would provide additional information to those who can use it. Instead of seeing visualization as a replacement to auditory music, it may be better to perceive visualization as a supplement to existing auditory information. Future research could present music visualizations with auditory music. Participants were also trying to find meaning in the colours used in the various visualizations. Given that it is difficult to find consensus on the meaning of specific colours, colour was only used as an aesthetic element rather than an informational one. Finding ways to use colour in music visualiza102

CHAPTER 5. FOCUS GROUP I

5.6. DISCUSSION

tion that is meaningful on an individual level would seem to be a useful research direction. One participant commented that they, "never thought of presenting music this way before." When asked what was the most enjoyable experience, a participant pointed to, "the fact that this is being experimented on." Comments like these imply that there is a sense within the D/HH communities that finding a way to display information about popular music is desired.

5.6.3

Limitations of the Design

The analysis of the data suggests at least four limitations of this study, one of which is related to questionnaire design. The first limitation of this design is that while asking how to represent music information, the Post-study Questionnaire did not also ask for some ranking of the importance of each type of information. As a result this must be extrapolated from the responses and comments. For example, it can be suggested that the information is important when a preference is specified and it can be suggested that there is no importance when a participant ignores the item and leaves it blank. However, any conclusion that is more specific cannot be established based on this data. Second, the wording of question 2 and question 3 in the Post-study Questionnaire (i.e., "Which style gave you the best sense of what was happening in the music?" and "Which style gave you the best sense of percussion / instruments playing / melody / rhythm?"), raises some issues around how the participant might interpret the phrase "best sense". While the design of the questionnaire was intended to leave this phrase open to interpretation, the fact that a participant may have no psychological reality of certain music information might mean they are unable to assess what visualization gave them the "best sense" of something because they would not know how to understand that concept. Third, the small sample size with an unequal number of men and women, while appropriate for a focus group, limits the statistical power of the results. The chi-square test for independence is sensitive to sample size as well as small expected frequencies in one or more of the cells in the table. For these reasons caution must be taken in interpreting chi-square if one or more cells are less than 5. However, according to Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero, "There is no hard-and-fast rule regarding the size of expected frequencies." (2011, p. 350). Most researchers limit the use of chi-square to tables that either a) have no expected frequencies values below 5 or b) have no more than 20 percent of the expected frequencies values below 5 (Frankfort-Nachmias & Leon-Guerrero, 2011). Finally, as mentioned earlier, given that the recruiting materials for this focus group specifically mentioned music, it is likely that the participants are self-selected. In other words, it is unlikely, given the recruiting materials, that a D/HH community member who might not like music or have any understanding of music would have attended this focus group. This is a weakness of the interpretability of the data because it does not allow generalization of the results over all possible consumers, only those who have any interest in music.

5.7. CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY

CHAPTER 5. FOCUS GROUP I

5.7

Conclusions From This Study

The focus group found that music was not conveyed well by the visualizations tested. Among the various observations: Â· The iTunes visualization was enjoyed the most and was selected most often as giving the best sense of what was happening; Â· While the Part Motion visualization presented the "best sense of what's happening" for several participants, they still preferred the iTunes visualization for overall enjoyment; Â· Participants could not relate the Tonal Compass and Piano Roll visualizations to the music; Â· Motion Pictures of Music (a visualization created in-house) was boring and too visually busy; and Â· Visualizations of music need to be aesthetically enjoyable and not too visually busy. This study explored several techniques for visualizing music with the goal of presenting music to D/HH consumers. Visualizations that focus entirely on music notes and timing, such as a piano roll, were found lacking. Designs that were thought to provide maximum information with, hopefully, little necessary training, like MPM, were found to be boring. Music consumers who are interested in being entertained are not necessarily interested in large amounts of information. In terms of music, accuracy of the visualization takes second stage to entertainment. Based on the verbal comments of the participants, there was just too many visualizations shown in the focus group. In particular, presenting four different views of MPM over the span of 18 different presentations of music was too much for the participants to take in. The MPM visualization also had the issue of forcing viewers to attend to multiple spaces at the same time rather than look at one core area of information. Participants also seemed at times confused as to which visualization was being referred to in the questionnaires. The questionnaires were also too difficult to follow for people for whom English is not their first language, a common issue among Deaf signers. These issues suggest a need to completely redesign how some questions are asked or response choices are presented. As shown in Figure 5.5 on the facing page, this focus group contained a full DRM loop because it introduced an intervention, the exposure of the participants to the videos and measured specific parameters in their experience of these visualizations. For the Dissertation as a whole, the work in this chapter represents part of the DS-I stage of the DRM. It qualifies as a DRM Stage 1 (Descriptive Study I) activity, which provides a baseline of critical parameters in a situation into which some design intervention will be eventually introduced.

Next Steps

These results raised several questions about visualization design to further explore. Based on these results, the MPM visualization and some of the displays provided by MAM must be discarded. It appears that the Part Motion visualization and iTune's Magnetosphere visualization need to be further explored.

Chapter 6

Focus Group II
The focus group described in the previous chapter found that music was not conveyed well by the visualizations tested and that visualizations of music need to be aesthetically enjoyable and not too visually busy. Since there were too many visualizations shown in the previous focus group and participants also seemed at times confused as to which visualization was being referred to in the questionnaires there is a need to reduce the number of visualizations and redesign how some questions were asked or response choices were presented. Thus, in an attempt to see if music can be conveyed better and the overall methodology can be improved, a second focus group was held to explore the top two visualizations from the earlier focus group as well as a newly developed visualization, to be described in Section 6.3.3 on page 112.

6.1

Goals

The goal of the study presented in this chapter is to answer the following questions: 1. Are efforts to improve accessibility desired? 2. How do viewers respond to visualizations of music information? 3. Do participants enjoy visualizations? 4. Are participants able to detect the intended emotion of a song solely through visualizations of music information?

Method
Step 1

In advance of the focus group, 30-second snippets of 20 popular songs (instrumental-only versions) were assessed by a group of four hearing people for the overall emotion each clip represented (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear). If these informants all agreed on the emotion the song represented, it was included in the set of twelve songs to be presented to the focus group.

6.3.2

Step 2

Using three different displays (Part Motion, Magnetosphere, and Radar) created from three different visualization tools (Music Animation Machine, iTunes, and Radar), prototype visualizations of 12 different popular music tracks representing four different emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear) were presented to D/HH participants in a focus group setting. This set of emotions was selected because they represent the "basic emotions" (Ekman & Friesen, 1986). These specific visualizations were selected because they were representative of the variation (using pitch, timbre and tempo in Part Motion, frequency and amplitude for iTunes, and pitch, tempo, timbre and beat for Radar) that is available according to the literature. The list of songs used is presented in Table 6.1. To capture the individual experience as well as the larger group comments multiple tools were 111

CHAPTER 6. FOCUS GROUP II

used to collect participant's responses to the prototypes. After each prototype was shown, participants were asked for their opinions about the visualization using a discussion format as well as the Post-visualization Questionnaire shown in Figure 6.2 on page 109. The Post-visualization Questionnaire asked participants about the effectiveness of the visualization in conveying emotions, representing music and whether the visual effects were enjoyable. Participants also completed a pre-study questionnaire to gather information about their music experiences as well as a post-study questionnaire to summarize their opinions of the music visualization experience. Since different D/HH people have different levels of hearing and different abilities to process whatever sound they can hear, the songs were presented without sound to control for variation of hearing levels. An ASL interpreter and a stenographer, to live caption the proceedings, were present to facilitate the participation of the D/HH participants.

6.3.3

Visualizations

Music Animation Machine The Music Animation Machine (MAM) described in Chapter 2 was used to produce the Part Motion (Balls) visualization. iTunes As noted in Chapter 2, the default visualizer of the iTunes media player application, Magnetosphere, provides visualizations based on waveform analysis of the audio input. Radar Recognizing that the above visualizations do not all present the properties of music, the Radar visualization, as shown in Figure 6.4, was developed by me and colleagues working at Ryerson's Inclusive Media and Design Centre1 . Radar consists of a black circle with lines that span its radius called "blades". While the size of each blade is static, other properties are used to communicate information about the music. The colour of the blade identifies the instrument (or instrument family) being played. The intensity of the colour shows the volume of the note; the louder the note, the more solid the blade appears. New blades move from the "3 o'clock" position either clockwise or counter-clockwise to show the difference in pitch between instruments in the same family. This provides a sense of the history of the music so far. For example, as the pitch rises higher, the blade rotates counter-clockwise. A new pitch is considered different from the previous pitch, thus the blade starts at the "3 o'clock" position and rotates counter-clockwise relative to the previous pitch. The speed of a blade's rotation is related to the instrument's own pitch; the higher the pitch, the faster it moves. The longer the note is held, the longer the blade is on screen.

6.3.4

Stimuli and their Properties

Instrumental-only versions of twelve popular songs representing four different emotions (i.e., three songs for each of: happy, sad, angry and fear) were randomly presented, without sound, for thirty seconds in each of the above visualization techniques (i.e., iTunes, MAM Part Motion display, and Radar). This set of emotions was selected because they represent the "basic emotions" (Ekman & Friesen, 1986). These specific visualizations were selected because they were representative of the variation (using pitch, timbre and tempo in Part Motion, frequency and amplitude for iTunes, and pitch, tempo, timbre and beat for Radar) that is available according to the literature. Table 6.2 shows the common types of musical information each of these visualizations can display. Some visualizations are unique in displaying specific information (e.g., Magnetosphere displays amplitude). It is not clear if any of these three visualizations (iTunes, MAM Part Motion display, and Radar) were explicitly designed to communicate emotions. Each of the four emotions had three presentations using the three music visualization styles. To help ensure they were not influenced by predisposition / familiarity with certain applications, the title bar of the application was always hidden from participants' view. The presentation screen was always turned off while setting up a visualization to show.

Questionnaires

Both the Post-visualization Questionnaire presented after each visualization was played and the Poststudy Questionnaire were changed from the previous focus group. Post-visualization Questionnaire After each presentation, participants participated in a follow-up discussion and completed the 9-item Post-visualization Questionnaire. This questionnaire (shown in Figure 6.3), which users know as "Music Questions", asked participants about the visualization presentation they just saw. It includes questions on whether the visualization was enjoyable; what, if any, meaning they felt it had; the degree they felt the music was happy / excited / overbearing; and the degree they thought the visualization (and thus the music) expressed happy / sad / angry / fear emotions. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the Pleasure / Arousal / Dominance (PAD) model of emotion is a dimensional model that attempts to decompose emotions into three orthogonal underlying dimensions: a) Pleasure (or valence), the degree of pleasantness of the emotional experience; b) Arousal, the level of activation of the emotion; and c) Dominance, the level of attention or rejection of the emotion (Mehrabian, 1996; J. A. Russell & Mehrabian, 1977). Each element has opposing dimensions (pleasure / displeasure, arousal / sleep, and dominance / submission) and forms one axis with opposing end points of a three-axes model. Emotional responses can be plotted along each of these axes. This model is complex to use as it requires the dissection of emotional responses into three separate categories. Given the complexity of the PAD model, the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), a non-verbal pictorial assessment technique, was designed for assisting people in identifying which of the dimensions fit their emotional state. It visually represents Mehrabian's three PAD dimensions (Lang, 1985), and has been shown to better track personal response to an affective stimulus (Bradley & Lang, 1994; Winton, Putnam, & Krauss, 1984). Figure 6.5 shows the SAM overbearingness scale, which is used to measure the PAD dimension of Dominance. SAM depicts each PAD dimension with a graphic character arrayed along a continuous nine-point scale. For pleasure, SAM ranges from a smiling, happy figure to a frowning, unhappy figure; for arousal, SAM ranges from sleepy with eyes closed to excited with eyes open. The dominance scale shows SAM ranging from a very small figure representing a feeling of being controlled or submissive to a very large figure representing in-control or a powerful feeling. 114

CHAPTER 6. FOCUS GROUP II

6.3. METHOD

Figure 6.5: Self-Assessment Manikin overbearingness scale (Bradley & Lang, 1994). As a pictorial tool, SAM may be easier to administer than other text-based scales because it is less affected by the language barriers experienced by D/HH people and others (e.g., non-English speaking people). In addition, participants can complete ratings on the SAM scales in less than 15 seconds, which reduces fatigue. While using SAM provides a simple mechanism for participants to evaluate their perception of the emotion of a song, no baseline PAD measures of the selected songs was developed for comparison with a hearing person's experience. While a baseline might allow one to define an objectively correct emotion for a specified song which can then be compared to participant responses, how to ensure such a metric is accurate is problematic. Participants also completed a 7-point scale rating the emotional impact of the visualization. There were four scales each representing happy, sad, angry, and fear. This set of emotions was selected because they represent the "basic emotions" (Ekman & Friesen, 1986). Participants rated ("1-weak" to "7-strong") the emotions presented by the visualization. Emoticons expressing each of these emotions were added to assist the participant. Post-study Questionnaire After all 12 visualizations were shown, participants participated in a follow-up discussion and then completed the Post-study Questionnaire. In the previous focus group, the question in the post-study questionnaire regarding which visualization style gave the best sense of drums, instruments playing, melody, and rhythm was entirely presented in text. It also had an option for "none". In this focus group, the Post-study Questionnaire, as shown in Figure 6.3 on page 110 was changed so that the question regarding which visualization style gave the best sense of drums, instruments playing, melody, and rhythm used colour pictures of the visualizations rather than text descriptions. Further, this question was now forced choice and did not provide for a "none" option. Since this questionnaire was paper-based, the researchers believed that participants would write something on the questionnaire if they felt that none of the choices provided the desired music information. This questionnaire also had several open-ended items for the collection of qualitative data in addition to the focus group discussions. These questions were the same as those used in the previous focus group.

Participants

This focus group had six participants: 3 deaf (3 female), 1 cochlear implantee (1 female), 2 hard of hearing (1 male, 1 female). Participants ranged in age from 19 to 55 (2 were 19-24, 2 were 25-34, 2 were 45-54). All six participants indicated always using closed captions when watching television. Three participants reported high school or some technical college as their highest level of formal education. Two reported being university graduates. One participant did not answer this question.

Goal 1 Â­ Desire for Improved Accessibility

As seen in Table 6.3, one deaf participant and one HH participant each reported listening to music "weekly", while one HH participant and one CI-using participant reported listening to music "daily". One deaf participant reported listening to music "rarely". The remaining deaf participant did not answer this question. As shown in Table 6.4 on the facing page, half the group reported that they "really enjoy listening to music" (1 HH, 1 deaf, 1 CI user) while the other half reported they "liked listening to music" (2 deaf, 1 HH). When asked for a description of their music experience during elementary or high school, as shown in Table 6.5, three participants indicated a somewhat positive experience. One indicated that they did not have any music classes. One could not recall their experience. One participant did not answer this question. For the most part, contingency table analysis did not show any significant trends among these responses. 116

Goal 2 Â­ Music Information Preferences

Participants were asked which visualization style gave the best sense of drums / percussion, instruments playing, melody, and rhythm. The results of this question are shown in Table 6.6. Note that some participants provided more than one answer. Participants stated that Radar was best for percussion information, while Part Motion was best for showing information about the instruments and melody. Participants chose all three for information on rhythm. There was a considerable quantity of rich qualitative data collected during the focus group. These results did not always agree with the data presented in Table 6.6. For example, participants comments on the different visualizations varied widely: Â· iTunes Â­ "gave me a more positive feel" Â­ [did not like] "excess movement" Â­ "just a jumble of lights, no connection to the music, very distracting" Â· Radar Â­ "Not my favourite format. Could be any piece of music. Don't like the background. Makes me think/feel that I'm watching a target / target practice" Â­ "I feel like this visualization requires too much to be explained in the sense that I don't understand what all the circles mean, versus the `lines' spreading." Â­ "lots of colour, brightness, beat" Â· Part Motion Â­ "A parade of nice and beautiful dancing lights" Â­ "I prefer this format. I like that the format helps you anticipate in the piece, re: what's coming next as well as showing a discernible history of what's already happened." Â­ "it's picking upon different things each time I see this type of visualization" Table 6.7 shows, participants' responses when asked which visualization gave the best sense of what was happening in the music. The majority chose the iTunes and Radar visualizations. 118

Goal 3 Â­ Level of Enjoyability

The summary discussion, a transcript of which is given in full in Appendix C, provided the best overview of the participants' experience and enjoyment levels for all of the different displays. When asked at the end of the focus group session which visualization they enjoyed most, as seen in Table 6.8, participants were equally split, two each, across the three visualizations. The majority of the deaf participants (2) preferred Radar, while one preferred the iTunes visualization. The HH participants were split between the Part Motion and iTunes visualizations, while the participant with a CI most preferred Part Motion. Table 6.8 shows the participants' most enjoyed visualization by hearing identity. The contingency table found in Table 6.9 shows participants' most enjoyed visualization by highest level of education. A chi-square test for independence was conducted to determine if there is any relationship between participants' highest level of education and their reported most enjoyed visualization. H0 : Participants' highest level of education and their reported most enjoyed visualization are independent.

Discussion
Goal 1 Â­ Are efforts to improve accessibility desired?

To determine whether efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH are wanted, there is a need to understand whether D/HH people are active consumers of music. Participants of this focus group responded favorably to music. For example, Table 6.3 on page 116 shows the contingency table of hearing identity and how much the participant listens to music. The majority of the group (80%) reported listening to music "weekly" or "daily". One deaf person reported listening to music "rarely". Similarly, Table 6.4 on page 117 shows participant's responses to the question "What statement de124

This group split 50%/50% on whether they "liked listening to music" (2 deaf, 1 HH) or "really enjoy listening to music" (1 HH, 1 deaf, 1 CI). No one responded "I do not like listening to music." or "I do not see the point of music." The deaf participant who reported rarely listening to music, also described themselves as liking music. Given that the recruiting materials for this focus group specifically mentioned music, it is likely that the participants self-selected on this item. In other words, it is unlikely, given the recruiting materials, that a person who might respond "I do not like listening to music." or "I do not see the point of music." would have attended this focus group. Thus, similar to Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, in answer to the question of whether efforts to create accessible music information are wanted, the responses of D/HH participants strongly support the notion that they actively seek music and enjoy the experience. No one reported having no interest in music. Some participants found the study very interesting and reported a desire to see more.

6.5.2

Goal 2 Â­ How do viewers respond to specific visualizations?

As mentioned in Chapter 1, of the Principles of Universal Design, Principle Three, "Simple and intuitive use", implies that the user interface of any visualization solution should be obvious. In the case of music visualization, this principle would suggest that the visualization itself should be simple and intuitive, even without sound. Similarly, Principle Four, "Perceptible Information", requires the design to communicate necessary information effectively to the user. Determining what types of music information would be considered useful and whether specific visualization styles communicated such information in a intuitive manner would support the Principles of Universal Design. As shown in Table 6.6 on page 118, when participants were asked which visualization style gave 125

6.5. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 6. FOCUS GROUP II

them the "best" sense of drums / percussion, instruments playing, melody, or rhythm, their responses were mixed. Participants found that Radar (4) gave the best sense of percussion. The Part Motion (2) visualization was also preferred for percussion. Participants found that the Part Motion visualization gave the best sense of instruments playing (4) as well as the best sense of the melody (4). Participants were split on the best visualization for rhythm choosing all three (iTunes (3), Radar (3) and Part Motion (3)). As Table 6.7 shows, when asked which visualization gave the best sense of what was happening in the music, one HH participant chose the Part Motion visualization while the other chose iTunes. The majority of the deaf participants (2) preferred Radar, while one preferred the iTunes visualization. One participant did not select a preference. Unlike the focus group described in the previous chapter, there was no statistically significant association between a participant's enjoyment of a particular visualization and their choice of which one gave the best sense of music.

6.5.3

Goal 3 Â­ Do participants enjoy visualizations?

As mentioned in Chapter 1, Principle One of the Principles of Universal Design, "Equitable use" suggests that a music visualization should be appealing. Determining whether specific visualization styles were enjoyable would support the Principles of Universal Design. When asked at the end of the focus group session which visualization they enjoyed most, as seen in Table 6.8, participants were equally split, two each, across the three visualizations. In fact no one group expressed a preference: HH participants were split between Part Motion and iTunes, the majority of deaf participants expressed a preference for Radar, and he sole CI-using participant expressed a preference for Part Motion. The statistically significant contingency table analysis finding an association between participants' highest level of education and the visualization they most enjoyed shown in Table 6.9 is likely an artifact of the small sample size. The chi-square test for independence is sensitive to sample size as well as small expected frequencies in one or more of the cells in the table. In this case more than 20 percent of the expected frequencies values were below five. Recall that the contingency table analysis of the twelfth visualization shown in Table 6.10 and Table 6.11 found statistically significant associations between the participant's Â· highest level of education and their enjoyment of the twelfth visualization; and Â· most enjoyed visualization and their enjoyment of the twelfth visualization. This statistically significant result is likely also an artifact of the small sample size as some participants did not provide responses to these questions at the time. Note also that the result of the chisquare test for independence in both cases were the same. While we would expect that participants might begin to favour specific visualization types over others as one neared the end of the focus group, as the contingency table in Table 6.11 shows, the unexpected statistically significant result with Table 6.10 (which occurred with no other visualization) must raise some suspicion when analyzing the 126

CHAPTER 6. FOCUS GROUP II

6.5. DISCUSSION

results of Table 6.11. It is entirely possible that this finding is valid, but it is also possible that other factors are influencing the result. At the conclusion of the focus group, participants expressed very positive feelings about the study. Participants reported most enjoying watching the visualizations and being stimulated by the experience. Participants reported that they least enjoyed not hearing the sound, feeling confused, and not feeling that they could connect what they were seeing to specific information (e.g., whether certain colours meant certain sounds, instruments, etc.).

6.5.4

Goal 4 Â­ Can participants detect emotions through visualizations?

As mentioned above, Principle Three of the Principles of Universal Design, "Simple and intuitive use", suggests that the visualization itself should be simple and intuitive, even without sound. Similarly, Principle Four, "Perceptible Information", requires the design to communicate necessary information effectively to the user. Determining whether information relating to emotion is conveyed by specific visualization styles in a intuitive manner would support the Principles of Universal Design. Table 6.13 on page 123 summarizes the PAD (Pleasure, Arousal, Dominance) emotion ratings of each song for each visualization by intended emotion (rated from 1 to 9). While there exists no baseline to compare these results against a hearing person's experience: Â· Happy songs tended to rate towards the Happy side of the Pleasure scale (x Â¯ = 6.07), the Calm side of the Arousal scale (x Â¯ = 4.0) and the Subtle side of the Dominance scale (x Â¯ = 4.13). Â· Anger songs tended to rate towards the Happy side of the Pleasure scale (x Â¯ = 4.53), the Excited side of the Arousal scale (x Â¯ = 5.1) and the Overbearing side of the Dominance scale (x Â¯ = 5.07). Â· Fear songs tended to rate towards the Happy side of the Pleasure scale (x Â¯ = 5.7), the Excited side of the Arousal scale (x Â¯ = 6.07) and the Subtle side of the Dominance scale (x Â¯ = 4.8). Â· Sad songs tended to rate towards the Unhappy side of the Pleasure scale (x Â¯ = 3.93), the Calm side of the Arousal scale (x Â¯ = 3.17) and the Subtle side of the Dominance scale (x Â¯ = 3.73). These results suggest that participants were able to interpret the intended emotion of the song using the PAD scale. Table 6.15 on page 124 summarizes the average discrete emotion ratings of each song (from "1weak" to "7-strong") for each visualization by intended emotion: Â· As shown in the first section of Table 6.15, participants tended to score happy songs as happy. Participants comments tended to identify the songs as happy. When asked what the visualization meant to them, responses included: "Good, happy, vibrant" , and "Catchy music. Good beat." Â· As shown in the second part of Table 6.15, participants tended to score angry songs as happy, fearful, or angry, depending on the visualization used. Participants comments did not trend toward the anger of the songs. Participants comments tended to identify the songs as aggressive 127

6.5. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 6. FOCUS GROUP II

and fearful. Responses included: "I felt like the person was on a stage, running from something or in a ballet." , and "Sort of fight/argue, group branch off, hang out one group, tough times." Â· As shown in the third part of Table 6.15, participants tended to score fearful songs as happy. Participants comments tended to identify the fearful songs as slow and calm. Responses included: "Booming sounds with different volumes going up and down, almost like rhythms" , and "Not sure." Â· As shown in the fourth part of Table 6.15, participants tended to score sad songs as sad except in the iTunes visualization. Responses included: "seems slow relaxing music." These results suggest that while participants were able to interpret the intended emotion of the song using the PAD scale, they were not necessarily able to accurately denote the intended emotion of the song using the discrete emotion ratings scale. However, their comments would suggest that the visualization was able to convey some interpretable sense of the emotion.

6.5.5

Limitations of the Design

The analysis of the data suggests at least four limitations of this study, two of which are related to questionnaire design. The first limitation of this design is that while asking how to represent music information, the Post-study Questionnaire did not also ask for some ranking of the importance of each type of information. As a result this must be extrapolated from the responses and comments. For example, it can be suggested that the information is important when a preference is specified and it can be suggested that there is no importance when a participant ignores the item and leaves it blank. However, any conclusion that is more specific cannot be established based on this data. Second, the wording of question 2 and question 3 in the Post-study Questionnaire (i.e., "Which style gave you the best sense of what was happening in the music?" and "Which style gave you the best sense of percussion / instruments playing / melody / rhythm?"), raises some issues around how the participant might interpret the phrase "best sense". While the design of the questionnaire was intended to leave this phrase open to interpretation, the fact that a participant may have no psychological reality of certain music information might mean they are unable to assess what visualization gave them the "best sense" of something because they would not know how to understand that concept. Third, the small sample size with an unequal number of men and women, while appropriate for a focus group, limits the statistical power of the results. The chi-square test for independence is sensitive to sample size as well as small expected frequencies in one or more of the cells in the table. For these reasons caution must be taken in interpreting chi-square if one or more cells are less than 5. However, according to Frankfort-Nachmias and Leon-Guerrero, "There is no hard-and-fast rule regarding the size of expected frequencies." (2011, p. 350). Most researchers limit the use of chi-square to tables that either a) have no expected frequencies values below 5 or b) have no more than 20 percent of the expected frequencies values below 5 (Frankfort-Nachmias & Leon-Guerrero, 2011). The small sample size also impacted the ANOVAs run on the data collected for this study since small sample sizes increase the difficulty of detecting assumption violations. Even if none of the test 128

CHAPTER 6. FOCUS GROUP II

6.6. CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY

assumptions are violated, a one-way ANOVA with small sample sizes may not have sufficient power to detect any significant difference among the samples, even if the means are in fact different. Finally, given that the recruiting materials for this focus group specifically mentioned music, it is likely that the participants are self-selected. In other words, it is unlikely, given the recruiting materials, that D/HH community members who might not like music or have any understanding of music would have attended this focus group. This is a weakness of the interpretability of the data because it does not allow generalization of the results over all possible consumers, only those who have any interest in music.

6.6

Conclusions From This Study

In conclusion, among other issues, in this focus group we observed that the iTunes visualization was still very positively responded to, but no one visualization was enjoyed the most. Unlike the study in Chapter 5, the Part Motion visualization did not give the "best sense of what's happening". The Radar visualization seemed to receive a good response, with comments like, "looks like people dancing." The participants enjoyed the visualizations and were able to interpret an emotional response from the music information the visualization conveyed. While music was conveyed better in this focus group, it still needs more work. One participant's comment is particularly instructive in this regard, "I think that care has to be taken when selecting type of visualization to use with each style of music." As shown in Figure 6.6, the work in this chapter represents the full DRM cycle because it introduced an intervention, the exposure of the participants to the videos, and measured specific parameters in their experience of these visualizations. In the larger scope of the Dissertation, this chapter, qualifies as contributing to a DRM Stage 2 (Prescriptive Study) activity because it evaluated a revised set of visualizations and added to our understanding of the situation into which some design interven-

Next Steps

Having explored how D/HH people respond to this set of visualizations, there remain several open questions. One such question is whether the D/HH communities want some technological means to support music listening. Further, if there is a need or expressed desire to represent music in a way that is more accessible for D/HH people, what information or types of information should be the focus of this technology? The next chapter will revisit the DRM Stage 1 (Descriptive Study I). It describes a paper survey that was conducted to get more information from members of the HH community on these and other open issues.

130

Chapter 7

Survey of Users' Music Needs
The work reported in the preceding chapters have clarified some aspects of the D/HH community's needs with regards to music. However, there exist several questions regarding the hard of hearing (HH) population that need to be better understood. For example: Â· Do HH people actively listen to and enjoy music? Â· Do HH music consumers report issues using their Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) to listen to music? Â· Do HH people make specific choices about the music they listen to as a result of their hearing loss? Â· What, if anything, do HH music consumers feel they need to better support their experience? Â· Is there a need or expressed desire to represent music in a way that is more accessible for HH people? In the survey reported in Chapter 4, the majority of HH respondents reported enjoying music, but there were some comments that music was often experienced as noise rather than as meaningful and pleasant. HH people actively try to make use of whatever residual hearing they have (Laszlo, 1994), unfortunately, HAs are known to distort music (Chasin, 2003). This distortion is a result of HA design. Many HAs have a limiter just after the microphone that is usually set somewhere between 88dB and 100dB. This design decision is based on the logic that since the loudest components of shouted speech are in the range of 85dB to 90dB sound pressure level (SPL), any sound above that is considered noise and should be limited. The result is that sounds louder than 90dB (e.g., rock music can exceed 100dB SPL) will be cut off. However, as noted in Chapter 4, few reports of HA satisfaction address this issue. The MarkeTrak survey, a consumer survey that measures attitudes towards HAs by asking for what activities a given 131

CHAPTER 7. SURVEY OF USERS' MUSIC NEEDS

consumer wears them, was conducted in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2008. "Listening to music" was only added as a survey item in 1997 (Kochkin, 2000). The most recent MarkeTrak survey shows that 77% of responding consumers indicated that "Listening to music" was an important need (they assigned scores of 3 or 4 on a four-point scale ranging from "Very important" to "Not at all important") while 36% indicated that that "Listening to music" was a critical need (they assigned assigned a 4 for "Very important" to this listening situation). This same survey found that 78% of respondents indicated some degree of satisfaction (17% "Somewhat Satisfied", 41% "Satisfied", 20% "Very Satisfied"), 8% indicated some degree of dissatisfaction (4% "Somewhat Dissatisfied", 2% "Dissatisfied", 2% "Very Dissatisfied"), and 14% responded "Neutral" (Kochkin, 2010). No one has asked HH music consumers about how they choose the music they listen to. It is entirely possible that whether their HA supports a satisfactory listening experience could determine the range of music genre HH consumers enjoy. On the other hand, lifestyle choices such as choosing specific genres of music (e.g., songs with deep bass or drums and few vocals) may be among the few available options for HH music consumers who cannot hear music without HAs and/or are not satisfied with the currently available hearing instruments and/or need additional information to fully enjoy the music experience. Whether HH music consumers feel they need some additional support to access music is not well understood. This chapter will describe a survey conducted with HH music consumers to determine if there is a desire for added support and, if so, how best to support their needs. Portions of this chapter appear in Fourney (2012).

Method

The study was based on a paper survey. The 14-item survey used open and closed questions to collect responses from HH people on their attitudes towards music, the technologies they use when listening to music, what experiences (good and bad) they have while trying to listen to music and the various strategies they use to improve this experience. The survey also asked what, if anything, participants would want a computer to do to help them better understand or enjoy their music experience. 132

Participants

The paper survey was conducted at a conference for HH people. Of the 150 surveys distributed, 36 participants (25 f, 11 m) aged 18 - 65+ completed it. All respondents identified themselves as having a hearing loss with 26 (72.2%) indicating they were HH, 7 (19.4%) said they have a CI, 2 (5.6%) identified themselves as deaf, and 1 (2.8%) identified themselves as deafened. As shown in Table 7.1, the majority of the respondents (25 or 69.4%) indicated that they always watch television with the captioning decoder turned on. In addition, a number of them (8 or 22.2%) indicated that they sometimes use closed captions while watching television. Only three respondents indicated never using captions. This suggests that most HH people use captions where available.

Discussion
Goal 1 Â­ Are efforts to improve accessibility desired?

To determine whether efforts to create music information that is accessible to the D/HH are wanted, there is a need to understand whether D/HH people are active consumers of music. Respondents of this survey responded even more favourably to music than was shown in Chapter 4. As shown in Table 7.3, nearly all respondents indicated that they "really enjoy" (21 or 58.3%) or "like" (12 or 33.3%) listening to music. Respondents could indicate a neutral response ("I do not like nor dislike music") to which one added the comment, "Can't always hear it properly." 140

CHAPTER 7. SURVEY OF USERS' MUSIC NEEDS

7.5. DISCUSSION

As shown in Table 7.2, 16 (44.4%) respondents indicated listening to music every day. One HH person wrote that they listen to music not just everyday, but "usually all day." Table 7.4 is a contingency table of the degree respondents reported enjoying music by their reports of their frequency of listening to music. The statistically significant relationship between the frequency with which respondents listened to music and the degree they reported enjoying music would be expected since one would not expect those who report not enjoying music to also frequently listen to it. Respondents were asked to list the technologies they use when listening to music. As seen in Table 7.5, there was a range of responses: 18 use the radio, 13 use a home stereo, 12 use a music player such as an iPod, 5 use a computer, and 4 watch music videos (e.g., on a television with captioning). Respondents were asked to identify the types of solutions they have used to try to access music. Table 7.6 shows there was a range of responses: 26 wear their HAs / CI / FM system (3 indicated they use special cables to directly connect their ALD to the stereo/computer playing the music), 25 increase the volume, 18 adjust the settings (e.g., balance, treble, bass, etc.), 16 use earphones / headset, 5 move closer to the speakers, 5 use music playing software with visualizations, 4 only listen to music with a strong beat, 2 have used a balloon (for the vibrotactile response created when the lowfrequency sounds are near the resonances of the balloon (Chasin, 2010)), 2 stated they try to memorize the lyrics, 1 indicated trying to cut down as much background noise in their environment as possible, and 1 stated that they have tried putting scotch tape over the microphones of their HA (this may reduce the microphone's sensitivity by 5Â­10dB and thus fool the HA into accepting louder input (Chasin, 2010). When asked if they were generally satisfied with the solutions they have tried, as Table 7.7 shows, of 35 respondents who answered this question, 18 (51.4%) indicated they were either satisfied (2 or 5.6%) or somewhat satisfied (16 or 44.4%) while 12 were evenly split between somewhat dissatisfied or dissatisfied (6 each or 16.7%). The statistically significant association between the degree of satisfaction with their music listening solutions and the degree respondents reported enjoying music suggests that the more satisfied respondents are with their music listening solutions, the more they enjoyed music. Similarly, the statistically significant association between the degree of satisfaction with their music listening solutions and the frequency with which respondents listened to music would be expected since one would expect that the more satisfied respondents are with their music listening solutions, the more they listen to music. While these results seem like there may not be very many issues for HH music consumers, Table D.5 on page 341 shows in detail that many of the respondents still reported frustration with accessing music with and without HAs. For example, one respondent who has a CI and indicated that they "really liked" music also commented that she "used to" like music and, "I would love to like listening to music again. I am happy I can still get the beat of the song but would love to know what song it is." Another commented, "It just does not sound good. I cannot make sense of a song. Old songs are not always recognizable." A HA user said, "Losing more interest. Familiar music does not now sound the same." The survey identified significant issues with HAs. Often respondents commented that they can only pick up the beat or some of the music, but not necessarily the lyrics. One CI user said, "Wearing my CI, it's either the beat / music or words, but never the clarification of both being blended together. 141

7.5. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 7. SURVEY OF USERS' MUSIC NEEDS

I heard better when I used to wear a hearing aid." Another respondent said, "All my life I have been HH. I have always listened to music but never for the most part understood words made out through music. I just listen to beats etc." Many commented on the special efforts they take to listen to music such as only listening to music they enjoyed before their hearing loss (and thus hopefully remembering how it sounds). Some make the effort to memorize lyrics.

7.5.2

Goal 2 Â­ What music information is wanted for access?

Respondents were asked to indicate what information, if any, they would most want a computer to help them with. Responses are shown in Table 7.8 on page 140. With respect to music information, the survey showed a strong desire (30 responses) for access to lyrics. When asked about access to any other music information (e.g., beat, instrumentation, etc.), song name had 23 responses, artist information had 18, instrument information had 11, and beat had 10. Respondents were asked to indicate three choices from a list, some indicated lyrics to be their first, second, and third choice. While respondents were not asked to rank their choices, in the case of lyrics some specifically noted it was their first choice.

7.5.3

Limitations of the Design

The analysis of the data suggests at least three limitations of this study, one of which is related to questionnaire design. The first limitation of this design is that while asking how to represent music information (i.e., question #9), the survey did not also ask for some ranking of the importance of each type of information. As mentioned earlier, many respondents imposed ranking onto the question (e.g., by noting `lyrics' as their most desired / important choice). This raises some challenges. For example, when analyzing the responses of those who did not add any further ranking, or comment, the importance of their response is unknown. The timing of this survey was also a limitation. Given that it was administered in parallel with the interviews described in the next chapter, there was no opportunity to use an initial analysis of the results to assist in the design of the interviews. Finally, the setting of this survey was not entirely ideal. The survey was administered in the midst of a national conference for HH people. The conference theme, "Good Vibrations" was oriented to the experience of music. It was advertised as including performances by three different musical groups, including a well-known Canadian country and folk singer who, among various honours, has earned three Juno Awards. Given that the conference theme and events specifically focused on music, it is likely that the participants of the survey are self-selected. In other words, it is unlikely, given the nature of the conference, that a HH community member who might not like music would have attended this conference. This is a weakness of the interpretability of the data because it does not allow generalization of the results over all possible consumers, only those who have any interest in music.

7.6. CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY

7.6

Conclusions From This Study

Music is not fully accessible to HH people. The sometimes long written comments respondents provided in this survey show the impact is significant: The music experience is frustrating, the lyrics are difficult (if not impossible) to understand, the full entertainment experience is lacking. This survey of HH people shows that there is a significant desire for access to lyrics. How to present a meaningful presentation of lyrics has not been sufficiently researched. For example, captioned videos have been used to explore whether animating the captioned lyrics can help express emotional content. However, the captions were confusing; and not all viewers liked the animation or understood its role (Vy et al., 2008). Future research in the area of captioning music lyrics is needed. As shown in Figure 7.3, the work in this chapter represents a partial DRM cycle because it does not introduce or examine a specific intervention. At the beginning of this chapter, there was a recognized need to refine the scoping of DRM Stage 0 discussed in Chapter 4. In particular, it remained unclear if HH people had specific needs unique to their community. As shown above, this survey found that indeed they do. In the larger scope of the Dissertation, this chapter, qualifies as contributing to a DRM Stage 1 (DS I) activity because it added to our understanding of the situation into which some design intervention could be eventually introduced.

7.7

Next Steps

To get a better sense of an individual's response, several people who had completed the survey described in this chapter were asked to participate in one-on-one interviews. The next chapter continues to revisit DRM Stage 1 (Descriptive Study I). It describes these interviews and discusses their findings.

One-on-One Interviews
Over the several experiments discussed in the previous chapters, groups of people were either surveyed or interviewed through focus groups about music and the various prototypes and approaches that had been developed or collected for this project to visualize music and lyrics. Interviews are often used to help interpret data collected in surveys and other group methods (American Statistical Association [ASA], 1997). Volunteers from among those who had completed the survey discussed in the previous chapter were asked to participate in one-on-one interviews. Portions of this chapter appear in (Fourney, 2012).

8.1

Goals

The goal of the study presented in this chapter is to answer the following questions: 1. How do viewers respond to specific properties (e.g., colour, speed) of particular visualizations? 2. What tools or activities do HH people currently use to access music? Note that Goal 1 is not looking at whether specific colours mean specific things, but rather whether any colour says anything or means anything to the viewer.

The remainder of this section will show only the directed questions of the interviews and the questionnaires used to collect additional data. Interview Questions 1.

Is there a difference in your experience of music today compared to the past? Do the same recordings still sound the same? What, if anything is missing today? 4. Do you think your music preferences are shaped by what you can or cannot hear? How does your hearing influence your choices of music you want to listen to? 5. When you listen to music, what strategies or solutions do you use to help you enjoy, understand, etc. the experience? (a) How well does strategy X work for you? (b) Why do you use it? (c) Does it work all of the time, some of the time? 6. (optional) Do you wear hearing aids while listening to music? How well does this work for you? 7. (optional) When you want to listen to music, what do you do (e.g., alone in a quiet room, concerts, etc.)? 8. How do you listen to music (e.g., Radio, Music player, Home stereo, Music videos, etc.)? (a) How well does strategy X work for you? (b) Why do you use it? (c) Does it work all of the time, some of the time? 9. What specific frustrations have you experienced when trying to listen to music? (a) What do you think would improve your experience with music? 10. If you wanted to use a computer to help you to better understand music, what would be the important pieces of information you would really want to know? (e.g., Song title, Artist name, Lyrics, etc.) Now I am going to show you some short videos of music visualizations that have been developed at Ryerson and elsewhere. I will not play the sound.

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS B What did you think of the colours? Do the colours have any meaning for you? (a) YES: what did they mean to you? (b) NO: did you want the colours to have any meaning for you? C What did you think of the speed of the visualization? (a) Was it too fast / slow?

8.3. METHOD

(b) What do you think should happen to the visualization if the song is fast / slow? Questions A, B, and C are repeated for the remaining two visualizations. Figure 8.1: Interview questions. Questions B and C focus on colour and speed to spark a broader discussion. Sometimes to get a person to spontaneously talk about problems with a product requires some prompting. Since colour and speed are items that most everyone has an immediate and intuitive feel for and can probably respond easily to, these topics are good "ice-breakers" for an interview. Thus, Questions B and C were intended to prompt the participant to discuss these items and highlight other issues that they see. This study used the Post-study Questionnaire already described in Chapter 6 and reproduced in Figure 8.2 on the following page for reference.

8.3

Method

During the interviews, participants were asked for more detailed information about their hearing loss, their experiences with music, and the strategies they use to access music. In addition, participants were presented with three different visualizations of the same song (participants were not told it was the same song) in randomized order with the audio muted (i.e., sound off) and asked, using a combination of closed survey tools and open interview questions, for their response. The song used was a MIDI version of the third movement of Johann Sebastian Bach's 4th Brandenburg Concerto (BWV 1049). As the presto movement, this five minutes long piece has a variety of quickly played notes and tends to fully exercise the visualizations used in this study. The three visualizations used were: Part Motion (Balls), Bars, and Radar. The Part Motion and Radar visualizations were used because they seemed to have success in earlier studies (e.g., the study described in Chapter 6 found that Part Motion gave the best sense of what was happening). The Bars visualization was added to balance the study and explore a new model of presentation. The Part Motion visualization, as shown in Figure 8.3(a), was described in Chapter 2. The Bars visualization, as shown in Figure 8.3(b), was based on the Classic Spectrum Analyser Plugin for Winamp (Lynch, 2007, 2009). In this visualization, notes are presented in a bar graph format. Each of the 32 bars rise and fall according to the note's onset, intensity (the louder the note, the higher the bar), and length (the longer the note, the longer the bar continues to be seen).

8.4. RESULTS

Figure 8.3: The music visualizations: (a) Part Motion, (b) Bars, and (c) Radar. the Radar visualization, the longer the note is held, the longer the bar is on screen. While the Classic Spectrum Analyzer uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculation, there is an emphasis function applied to this data to make the result more visually interesting. The result is that this visualization tends to be biased for treble sounds. The plug-in supports several display modes, the "Fire" display was used for this study. The Radar visualization, as shown in Figure 8.3(c), was described in Chapter 6. Each interview was conducted face-to-face in a quiet room for approximately 30 minutes. All interviews were video-recorded and later transcribed.

8.3.1

Grounded Theory

The study described in this chapter draws on Grounded Theory (GT) methodology as described in Chapter 3. In particular, the interviews conducted were transcribed and thematically coded for further analysis.

8.3.2

Participants

The one-on-one interviews involved eight participants (6 female, 2 male) aged 18 - 65+ who all identified themselves as HH (in this case, this is a cultural label, audiologically some participants were deaf persons who did not sign, and some were CI users). Three participants were born HH. Five participants were born hearing and acquired their hearing loss later in life.

8.4

Results

All raw data is presented in Appendix E. In terms of their musical experiences, several participants indicated a reliance on past memory of music to help them enjoy and understand music. Two could no longer hear music at all and were interested in this research as a new way to experience music. As with the survey described in Chapter 7, 149

Note. Some participants made more than one choice. Table 8.1: Participant responses to music information. all but one participant indicated that they really want access to lyrics. When asked what they felt was missing in their experience of music, 6 reported missing the lyrics, 2 reported not hearing (or being able to identify) the entire song, 2 could not always detect the beat / rhythm, 2 reported missing the lower (bass) pitch ranges, and 1 reported missing the higher pitch ranges. As one participant reported, "Music is now just noise." The interviews had two major areas of discussion: a) the participants' experiences with music, both past and present; and b) the participants' responses to the visualizations. The remainder of this section will first discuss specific results that only pertain to the participants' responses to the visualizations. This section will then discuss the participants' comments and descriptions regarding the solutions and strategies they have tried or currently use when attempting to listen to music. The codes used for the data analysis of the interview transcripts are listed in Appendix E.

8.4.1

Goal 1 Â­ Visualization Responses

Part Motion (Balls) Visualization As shown in Table 8.1, participants responded well to the Part Motion visualization indicating that it was the best choice for understanding what instruments were playing and the melody. Participants really enjoyed this visualization and indicated it was the one that gave them the best sense of the music. One participant found that "The colour wasn't vibrant enough" and that there was not enough colour in this visualization, while another said that, "the way it works it doesn't need to be colourized." When first presented with this visualization, all but one participant was not quite certain how to read it. For example, "The circles I mean at first they didn't really mean anything to me." As they continued to watch it, nearly all of them reported seeing music in the visualization (e.g., "the colours . . . may represent the different tones of the music" ). The participants tended to recognize that the colours represented the different instruments. All of the participants reported that the speed of the visualization was "good" , neither too fast nor too slow. 150

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS Bars Visualization

8.4. RESULTS

Table 8.1 further shows that the Bars visualization was not perceived as highly as the Part Motion. Participants indicated that this visualization provided the best sense of the rhythm. Participants liked the colours used. They were described as "hot" and "dancing together." One participant interpreted the redness of the visualization as showing, "how loud and deep the sound is." However, another participant reported that the blending of yellows and reds looked "monotone" and that the colours provided "no meaning to me whatsoever." Some participants quickly saw the music in the visualization and openly mentioned it without prompting. For example, one said that she thought she saw the song's bridge. Six of the participants reported seeing music in this visualization. Three thought they were seeing a "rock" song. In contrast to the participants' experience of the speed of the Part Motion visualization as "good" , all of the participants described the speed of the Bars visualization as "fast" . Several participants were bothered by the busyness of the visualization: Â· "I find too many actions going on at once." Â· "it was very fast, like extremely fast." Â· "It's just a mixture. It's like a jumble." Radar Visualization Participants responded most poorly to the Radar visualization. It had several colour palate issues, especially for the older participants. Participants did not ascribe any meaning to the colours or could not determine what the colours were intended to represent. Older participants mentioned that the colours were not bright enough. One participant did recognize that the central red circle represented the main beat of the song. Another found this same feature "very annoying." Six participants reported seeing music in the visualization, especially a beat. As one participant said, "I swear there is a drum playing in there." Similar to the Part Motion visualization, participants described the speed of the Radar visualization as "good" or "moderate" , neither too fast nor too slow. While some participants described this visualization as "confusing and annoying" , there were a few that recognized that the up and down movement of the blades showed different tones or pitches.

8.4.2

Goal 2 Â­ Solutions Used to Access Music

As with the survey presented in the previous chapter, participants discussed the solutions they use when trying to listen to music. A thematic analysis showed their comments fell along several themes. Environment Participants discussed how they manipulate their environments, including themselves, to support music listening. Moving to face the source of sound and/or moving closer to the source of sound was a 151

8.4. RESULTS common option.

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

Several participants described how they manipulated the settings of their stereos for music playing. Two mentioned manipulating the equalizer, balance, and other settings to get a better (for them) sound. Four mentioned turning up the volume. Two mentioned the need for a quiet space. For example, "If I am in a quiet room and I can get away from any background noises and stuff, that makes a big difference." One common statement was, "If I am alone I will turn the volume up." Participants described needing to be alone to enjoy music and frequently mentioned that the way the HH person listens to music annoys hearing family members (e.g., its too loud). Live concert environments were also mentioned. Two participants stated that they get more enjoyment from music in live performance venues than when listening to recordings, "if I go to a live concert, if it is a small venue, I feel like I have a satisfactory experience listening to music." This may be because concert environments provide more than a purely auditory experience, "I also just love the energy of the people, the performers themselves." Technology Participants frequently discussed using different technology to support listening to music. This included discussions of their HAs, CIs, and other ALDs. For example, one participant reported directly connecting their music player to their CI. Four participants reported wearing large headphones to hear music. Two of these people reported wearing the headphones over their ALDs. Several participants reported issues with their ALDs: Â· One participant said that they had a better experience listening to music with their old HA ("I [could] hear the clarity of the words and the music combined very well" ) than with their current CI. This person found that they cannot hear music at all with their CI ("But when I was fitted with the CI, I couldn't do that anymore. And I mourn the loss of music" ). Â· Several participants reported that their HA was not meeting their full needs, "[with HAs] I am doing very well, functioning very well with conversation, but music is just gone." One participant noted that when wearing HAs, she heard too many sounds that were not the music, "I find that with the hearing aids on I am hearing things that are actually distracting me from the music." A few participants reported removing their ALDs to listen to music. One reported that he would remove his HA to wear earbuds when listening to music. This person reported that the earbuds gave him a better experience. Screens Several participants reported the use of a screen when listening to music. For example, one participant reported using online videos to watch performers sing songs, "YouTube allows me to visualize and see her sing." By watching the person sing the song, this HH viewer got more information about the words being used because they could lip-read the performer. 152

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

8.5. DISCUSSION

Four participants reported using captions. However, there were several comments that this worked best where the captions were in coordination / synchronization with the song. Captioning lag was noted as an issue when understanding a song. Familiarity As mentioned in the previous chapter, HH people report making an effort to memorize the lyrics of music they enjoy. Interview participants reported taking extra efforts to learn a song and become fully familiar with it. Five participants reported a preference for listening to familiar music. Regarding "new" songs, participants either reported not bothering with them because they did not know the song or listening to it multiple times to hopefully eventually understand and work out the melody and/or words. Listening to lyrics and following lyrics was a frequent area of discussion. According to one participant, "When it comes to music with lyrics, I will often download an entire album, look up all the lyrics, learn them, and this allows me to actually hear the song better when I am listening to them." Four participants spoke of getting the lyrics either through album information (e.g., album notes, J-card, CD booklet, etc.) or online. By memorizing or following the lyrics, the HH listener can anticipate what they will hear as they listen to the song. Although one participant stated that she plays music in the background while doing other work, another participant noted that there was a specific mental effort for them when listening to music, "Background music doesn't really do it for me, so I have to be paying attention to the music to enjoy it." This is not surprising because the variability of hearing across the HH population means that different people will have different experiences and different uses of music. Hearing people report similar uses of music (e.g., Beentjes, Koolstra, & van der Voort, 1996). Behaviour of Others Some participants noted that their understanding of the song being played or information about the song being played is based on the behaviour of the people around them. Two participants noted that family members or friends will often tell them the name of a song that is being played. Another participant stated that, when at a bar, they know what is playing by lipreading strangers as they sing / mouth the lyrics.

Discussion
Goal 1 Â­ How do viewers respond to specific visualization properties?

As mentioned in Chapter 1, of the Principles of Universal Design, Principle Three, "Simple and intuitive use", implies that the user interface of any visualization solution should be obvious. In the case of music visualization, this principle would suggest that the visualization itself should be simple and 153

8.5. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

intuitive, even without sound. Similarly, Principle Four, "Perceptible Information", requires the design to communicate necessary information effectively to the user. Determining what types of music information would be considered useful and whether specific visualization styles effectively communicated such information in a intuitive manner would support the Principles of Universal Design. Participants stated that each visualization suggested a different genre. For some participants: Â· The Part Motion visualization was described as a "country" song. Â· The Bars visualization was described as a "very fast and very loud" song. Â· The Radar visualization was described as a "happy, bouncy song." Note that these visualizations all represented the same song. This observation suggests several things. First, that participants actively tried to apply meaning to what they were seeing. Second, that when designing music visualizations, different visualizations could be used with different music genres (rather than seeking a specific design for all music types) as a means of assisting viewers and providing more information. Helmholtz theorized that perception is an active process involving memory and other internal processes (Helmholtz, 1867/1925). Similarly, (Gregory, 1998) theorized perceptions as predictive hypotheses, based on knowledge stored from the past. In trying to understand the images, the participants tended to compare what they were watching to their past experiences, prior knowledge, or to other images. For example, several described the Bars visualization as looking like a "nighttime cityscape" or "wall of fire." The Part Motion visualization was described as "bicycles" and "people dancing." The Radar visualization was described as an old television "test pattern" and "a clown." Having a psychological reality of music assisted participants when interpreting the visualizations. When specifically prompted with a question like, "did you see music in that visualization?", the responses were mixed. Participants with more music experience and music training appeared to respond better to the visualizations than those who did not. This suggests that for D/HH adults, any form of music information presentation (including visualization) may need frequent, repeated exposure and training, especially for those with little musical experience. This should be expected since no one develops an understanding of music without a lifetime of exposure. Hearing children are repeatedly exposed to the music of their family's culture(s) from a very young age (in the womb). Starting with very simple musical tunes and moving to more complex songs throughout their childhood, hearing people carry that musical knowledge into adulthood. Hearing adults develop their understanding of music over a lifetime.

8.5.2

Goal 2 Â­ What tools or activities do HH people use to access music?

Participants were asked if they make specific choices about the music they listen to as a result of their hearing loss. All of them, including those who had been hearing for some period in their lives, responded that they had never considered the question. Of the six who provided an answer to this question, only one said "No." Those who had lost their hearing all reported listening to music that they 154

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

8.5. DISCUSSION

knew from before their hearing loss and relying on this past memory of specific music pieces to help them fill the gaps they cannot hear anymore. The responses of the on the topic of the technologies participants use to listen to music support literature that indicates issues with ALDs (e.g., Chasin, 2003; He & Limb, 2014). No one ALD supports the needs of HH music consumers. There is a substantive technology gap remaining. The inadequacies of the devices impacts understanding both the music and the lyrics. From participants' descriptions of the work they do to become familiar with music, there is evidence that HH music consumers take exhausting extra efforts to enjoy the music they can understand.

8.5.3

Limitations of the Design

The analysis of the data suggests at least four limitations of this study, two of which are related to questionnaire design. The first limitation of this design is that while asking how to represent music information, the Post-study Questionnaire did not also ask for some ranking of the importance of each type of information. As a result this must be extrapolated from the responses and comments. For example, it can be suggested that the information is important when a preference is specified and it can be suggested that there is no importance when a participant ignores the item and leaves it blank. However, any conclusion that is more specific cannot be established based on this data. Second, the wording of question 2 and question 3 in the Post-study Questionnaire (i.e., "Which style gave you the best sense of what was happening in the music?" and "Which style gave you the best sense of percussion / instruments playing / melody / rhythm?"), raises some issues around how the participant might interpret the phrase "best sense". While the design of the questionnaire was intended to leave this phrase open to interpretation, the fact that a participant may have no psychological reality of certain music information might mean they are unable to assess what visualization gave them the "best sense" of something because they would not know how to understand that concept. Third, the small sample size with an unequal number of men and women, while appropriate for a series of interviews, limits the statistical power of quantitative results. The chi-square test for independence is sensitive to sample size as well as small expected frequencies in one or more of the cells in the table. In most cases, researchers limit the use of chi-square to tables that either a) have no expected frequencies values below 5 or b) have no more than 20 percent of the expected frequencies values below 5 (Frankfort-Nachmias & Leon-Guerrero, 2011). However, in the case of this study, the interest lay more in the qualitative results. This study was intended as a usability study. The goal was not validation of any specific designs but to gain further insight. Nielsen and Landauer suggest that collecting data from a single test user can elicit a third of all there is to know about the usability of a specific design. Each successive participant will repeat some of the insights of previous participants. As this implies, the best results come from testing small numbers of users (e.g., N = 5, 8, etc.) (Nielsen & Landauer, 1993). The caveat is that these participants must be comparable users. When groups of users with sufficiently different needs and behaviours are involved (i.e., different populations), there is a need to test each group sep155

8.6. CONCLUSIONS FROM THIS STUDY

CHAPTER 8. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

arately since each group may raise a different set of usability issues. Thus, the small sample size is appropriate given the purpose of the study. Finally, the setting for this set of interviews was not entirely ideal. The interviews were conducted in the midst of a national conference for HH people. The conference theme, "Good Vibrations" was oriented to the experience of music. It was advertised as including performances by three different musical groups, including a well-known Canadian country and folk singer who, among various honours, has earned three Juno Awards. Given that the conference theme and events specifically focused on music, it is unlikely that the interview participants would not somehow report liking music. In other words, it is unlikely, given the nature of the conference, that a HH community member who might not like music would have attended this conference (and thus be available to volunteer to participate in an interview). This is a weakness of the interpretability of the data because it does not allow generalization of the results over all possible HH consumers, only those who have any interest in music.

8.6

Conclusions From This Study

Music is not fully accessible to D/HH audiences. The impact is significant: The music experience is frustrating because the lyrics are difficult to understand, the emotional content is not fully communicated, and the full entertainment experience is lacking. Like the survey of HH people discussed in the previous chapter, these interviews show that there is a significant desire for access to lyrics. This is clearly exemplified in the extra efforts taken to understand and / or memorize the lyrics. Given the effort that HH music consumers are willing to take to get access to some part of a piece of music, these interviews raise questions like: Why do we want to experience music? What benefits does music provide? As shown in Figure 8.4, the work in this chapter represents the full DRM cycle because it introduced an intervention, the exposure of the participants to the videos.

Discussion and Conclusion
This chapter reviews the problem investigated in this Dissertation and synthesizes the results of my work providing an overview of conclusions drawn from the reported work. The chapter describes future directions of this research and potential future applications. Finally, this chapter ends with the conclusion of this Dissertation and a statement of its contribution.

9.1

Discussion

At a high level, the main research questions of this Dissertation are: 1. What are the fundamental properties of music that a visualization must present and that produces an entertaining and meaningful experience for D/HH people? This question required an exploration of the invisible components of music and how these elements of music influence the entertainment of its listeners. As was clear from the literature reviewed in Chapter 2, music is a highly complex information space involving multiple atomic components. This raised several questions about whether the focus of visualizations should be on making visible specific atomic music primitives (e.g., tones) or higher level concepts (e.g., melody, key), both, or something else entirely. As was shown in the focus group described in Chapter 5, visualizations of tonality, harmony, pitch change, timing, instrumentation present, and beat / rhythm information were too complex and not appreciated. Participants strongly preferred aesthetic and entertainment elements over information elements. In contrast, as the Chapter 8 interviews showed, some knowledge of how to interpret the visualization is needed or the information is not able to be fully appreciated. While this question remains partially answered, especially for deaf respondents, the results of the studies in Chapter 5 and Chapter 8 suggest that the Part Motion display seems to provide some understanding that can be associated with the idea of "music". For HH respondents, the results of Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 shows lyrics represent a key piece of music information they require of a visualization. The issue of lyrics will be further discussed below. 159

9.1. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

2. What are the emotional experiences and interpretations of users from visualizations? Logically, just as aural music (the invisible) is interpretable by the listener, a visualization of music (the visible) should be interpretable by the viewer. Ideally, if listeners can construct an emotional experience from what they hear, so should viewers. From the literature reviewed in Chapter 2, it appears that music communicates complex emotional signals and that, at least in Western cultures, it has specific conventions designed to manipulate emotions. What is not clear in the literature is whether this can be translated into other modalities. The results discussed in Chapter 6 show that, in the case of the visualizations used, the emotional component of the music is not fully and reliably communicated. For example, participants interpreted songs that were angry or fearful as happy. The results discussed in Chapter 8 suggest that different visualizations might be better suited to different genres. This would suggest that different visualizations might also be better suited to convey different moods. However, the results in Chapter 6, where respondents could indicate the intended emotion of a song on the PAD scale but not necessarily interpret the emotion of the song using the emotion scale, suggests that, for the set of visualizations explored, emotions can be approximately conveyed but may not be obvious. Based on the responses of the participants, for the set of visualizations explored, it is not likely that different visualizations will convey different moods. Thus this question remains partially answered. 3. Is it possible to create a D/HH music experience similar to hearing audiences? The literature reviewed in Chapter 2 suggests that music is a highly complex container of shared information and knowledge presented through sound. In addition to the social experience, there is a personal experience. The song on its own is not the full source of the entertainment experience. The memories associated with past exposure to the song and the emotions those memories evoke influences the experience of the song. For hearing people, music is not just a cultural element, it impacts their lives. What is not clear in the literature is whether music impacts D/HH communities in similar ways. A further review of the literature in Chapter 4 showed that signing Deaf communities have indigenous forms of lyrical music. While these may not be melodic in the Western expectation, they still conform to the idea of music as metrical lyrics accompanied by instrumentation. Chapter 4 showed anecdotally that members of the Deaf community do express an appreciation for music. They engage in this for various reasons including understanding their hearing friend's appreciation for music. Chapter 4 also suggests, on an anecdotal level, that there is evidence of members of the Deaf community who engage in the performance of Western music. As noted in Chapter 6, for various reasons, no baseline PAD measures of the selected songs was developed to compare a hearing person's emotional experience with that of the D/HH participants. Thus, it is not possible to determine if D/HH participants experienced a similar emotional response to that of hearing people to the same song. While the results reported in Chapter 6 clearly showed that participants trended towards an accurate indication of the intended emotion of the song, we cannot determine if the experience is `similar' to that of a hearing listener. 160

Table 9.1: How often do you listen to music? (by hearing identity) Over the span of the experiments reported in Chapters 4 through 8, various common questions were asked of all participants. Table 9.1 shows the response to the frequency in which respondents listened to music across all experiments. As shown in Table 9.1, over half of all respondents (50 or 53.2%) indicated that they listen to music frequently, if not daily. Of the 37 participants who identified themselves as deaf, 15 (40.5%) indicated that they listen to music frequently, if not daily. This suggests that whether the D/HH participants of this project have a music experience similar to hearing audiences or not, they are active consumers of music. Table 9.2 on the next page shows the degree in which respondents reported liking music across all experiments. As shown in Table 9.2, over half of all respondents (76 or 82.6%) indicated that they "like" or "really like" listening to music. Of the 37 participants who identified themselves as deaf, 26 (70.3%) indicated that they "like" or "really like" listening to music. Again, this suggests that whether the D/HH participants of this project have a music experience similar to hearing audiences or not, they are active consumers of music. Table 9.3 on page 163 reviews the data in Table 9.2 in terms of respondents who really enjoy or like music. Given the number of cells with counts less than one, a 2 Ã 2 contingency table was used to perform a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is any relationship between the participant's hearing identity (deaf or HH) and their report of how much they liked music. H0 : Deaf or HH identity and the Participant's report of how much they liked music are independent. Ha : Deaf or HH identity and the Participant's report of how much they liked music are not independent. Fisher's exact test, a statistical test used to determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables, was also performed to test these hypotheses. 161

Table 9.2: What statement describes you best? (by hearing identity) There is a statistically significant relationship between whether one likes music and their identity, X 2 (1, N = 82) = 4.482, p = 0.034, two-tailed Fisher's exact test p = 0.049. Since the p -values are less than the significance level (0.05), we cannot accept the null hypothesis. Thus, participants were more likely to report that they liked music if they were HH. While these results provide evidence that among the D/HH participants of this project there appears to be great interest in music, care must be taken when generalizing these results to the larger D/HH community. As noted in previous chapters, with the exception of the study presented in Chapter 4, it is likely that the participants of these studies are self-selected for high interest in music. In other words, it is unlikely, given the nature of the recruiting materials used, that a D/HH community member who might not like music would have participated in these studies. The study in Chapter 4 is an exception because participants were not informed of the musical nature of the stimuli until after they became involved in the experiment. This is a weakness of the interpretability of the data because it does not allow generalization of the results over all possible D/HH consumers, only those who have any interest in music. The above results would certainly suggest that D/HH people have some sort of music experience. Is it a "similar" experience to that of hearing audiences? Should D/HH people even expect an experience "similar to hearing audiences"? If so, what is a "similar" experience? Of the principles of universal design, Principle One "Equitable use", is particularly relevant here. It requires the design of a system or product to be useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities, be appealing to all users, and provide the same or equivalent means of use for all users. This might provide us with some direction toward defining a "similar" experience because Principle One implies that the music itself, not just the visualization, should be equitable across users regardless of ability. However, care must be taken that the focus remains, not on the user or the product (i.e., music), but, as suggested in Chapter 1, on the interaction between them. We cannot fix the user or the prod162

Table 9.3: Tends to like music? (by hearing identity) uct, only the interaction. Thus, the interaction is the space of the "similar" experience, if it exists. The results in Chapter 8, shows that existing ALDs are not able to assist all HH music consumers. CI users, in particular, report not hearing music at all, a result consistent with other literature (e.g., He & Limb, 2014). HA users report issues with distortion, environmental noise, and so on, a result also consistent with the literature (e.g., Chasin, 2003). Thus while ALDs can provide an experience (possibly negative) of music, they cannot provide a "similar" experience to hearing audiences. Having access to lyrics and, in particular, lyrics synchronized to the music is one area that would improve the interaction. The results of Chapter 7, where HH music consumers reported wanting access to the lyrics above all else, would suggest that this sole intervention may meet the needs of many HH music consumers enough to create a "similar" experience. The issue of lyrics will be further discussed below. What is not clear is what other invisible aspects of music would provide that "similar" experience for those who need more of music to be visible than just the lyrics. Thus, the question of whether it is possible to create a D/HH music experience similar to hearing audiences cannot be fully answered in this Dissertation and needs more exploration. While this question remains only partially answered, at least one intervention exists, the provision of lyrics, that may sufficiently meet the needs of some members of the D/HH communities to have a music experience similar to hearing audiences.

9.1.1

The Issue of Lyrics

The results of Chapter 7 show that there is a strong desire (30 of 95 responses or 31.6%) among HH music consumers for access to written (visible) lyrics. When asked about access to any other invisible music information, lyrics is still most important. Lyrics have become widely available and can usually be downloaded from the Internet and stored within one's own music library. Applications such as SongGenie have been developed to find lyrics based on one's iTunes library information and will update a song's music metadata (i.e., identifying information of the song such as the title, artist, album, 163

9.1. DISCUSSION

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

track number, etc. stored in the MP3 file itself) to include lyrics. In addition to music players themselves, various mobile applications also exist for presenting lyrics. For example, SoundHound provides users with access to a search mechanism that can identify a song being played and then present the lyrics of that song in real time. Using this application to play a file from one's own music library enables the user to access the lyrics, in real time, from SoundHound 's own lyrics library. While this appears to solve the problem of getting lyrics, it actually does not. First, since most online lyrics libraries are crowd sourced, D/HH music consumers cannot completely trust the accuracy or completeness of the lyrics that are available. Second, how to present a meaningful presentation of lyrics, in particular for D/HH users, has not been sufficiently researched. As discussed in Chapter 2, the captioning of dialogue has a long history of research and has several well known usability issues, the issues related to the captioning of music is not well understood. Music has properties that make it very different from dialogue, yet the few studies that have explored the problem tend to start from the perspective that the issues are the same. These studies "put the cart before the horse" in that they assumed the usability issues involved with captioning dialogue are the same as those involved in the captioning of lyrics without first conducting the necessary research to determine if they are indeed the same. Music typically breaks the rules of dialogue even when being used as dialogue. For example, in musical theatre, music is commonly used to support dialogue. A common method is to have multiple performers sing the same song as if engaged in a conversation. When captioned, such songs look like dialogue except that additional characters (e.g., eighth notes) are appended to indicate the presence of music/ singing. Occasionally performers of musical theatre sing different lines of the same song at the same time. Captioning this, using current approaches, in a manner that is understandable to D/HH audiences is extremely difficult (e.g., it requires reading two lines of text at the same time, understanding that they are distinct voices and, in violation of existing captioning conventions, understanding they are being sung simultaneously rather than consecutively). As discussed in Chapter 2, there are no recommended approaches for presenting such lyrics. Worse, musical theatre composers will sometimes combine multiple songs into the same "conversation". This involves different performers singing different melodies, sometimes in different keys, and sometimes overtop of each other all at the same time. An example of this can be seen in the English adaptation of the musical Les MisÃ©rables (SchÃ¶nberg & Kretzmer, 1986) where the song "One Day More" at the end of Act I includes at least three overlapping songs: the main song being sung by Valjean, Marius, and others; an overlapping verse of "Master of the House" performed by the Thenardiers; and another overlapping verse with a different melody and metre from the main song being sung by Javert. Accurately captioning this, using current approaches is impossible. Given that it is text-based, captioning provides no ability to quickly denote the different changes in melody or metre without adding to the audience member's already strained reading skills. Even if the audience member is sufficiently HH to understand generally what is going on, the cognitive load is significant and much will be missed. 164

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 9.2. SOME DESIGN GUIDELINES AND CONSTRAINTS While there are some conventions used to display lyrics for HH people using current closed captioning technology, there is no research to substantiate if they constitute best practice. Further, not all captioning providers follow the same conventions (Clark, 2004). A better music captioning technique is desired (Jordan et al., 2003). Research on whether synchronized presentations of the lyrics (e.g., as SoundHound provides) or static presentations of the lyrics (e.g., like iTunes provides) would be preferred by D/HH consumers does not exist. These issues provide ample opportunities for future directions of the research developed in this Dissertation.

9.2

Some Design Guidelines and Constraints

While the DRM was used in this Dissertation to organize the reporting of the experiments and the presentation of the results rather than being used during the execution of the experiments, some design constraints / guidelines were learned in the process: 1. Visualizations of music are largely deficient without sound (Chapter 5). Visualizations need to include the audio presentation of sound and should be used only as sensory supplementation. 2. Visualizations should not be too visually busy (Chapter 5). 3. Visualizations should include aesthetic / entertaining elements (Chapter 5). While users want to be entertained, simple representations that communicate a sense of what is happening in the music might still prove useful, especially if combined with entertaining views. 4. Visualizations intended for D/HH audiences should not require the viewer to move their eyes left and right to see obvious information. The "important stuff" needs to be in one place (Chapter 5). 5. Visualizations of music need to clearly highlight the melody (Chapter 5). 6. Visualizations intended for D/HH audiences should be designed to not have information elements that too easily distract the viewer from more "important" elements. For example, the MPM visualization presented in Chapter 5 used a large, centrally located, constantly in motion, information element to display percussion information that drew viewer's attention away from other information elements. Large distractors can make an informative visualization less useful. 7. Colours need to be carefully selected. When visualizations use white backgrounds, the information they present is very difficult to see. Darker backgrounds make coloured information elements appear sharper (Chapters 5 and 8). 8. Any proposed colour palette should be user tested with elderly people because they may not be able to easily see the visualization information if the palette is not sufficiently bright (Chapter 8). 165

9.3. CONTRIBUTION

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

9. Rather than seeking a specific design for all music types, different visualizations could be used with different music genres. This would provide viewers a further means of assistance in interpreting the information presented and providing more information (Chapter 8). 10. Expect that any form of music information presentation (including visualizations) may need frequent, repeated exposure and training to be understandable or usable. This may be especially true for those D/HH users with little musical experience or a limited psychological reality of music (Chapter 8). These guidelines are consistent with several Principles of Universal Design, for example: Â· Principle One, "Equitable use" suggests that a music visualization should should also be appealing while still enabling users to listen to the music, if desired. Â· Principle Two, "Flexibility in use", implies that any solution should be adaptable; designed with as many user options as necessary. For example, options such as colour choice, size on screen, or amount of information presented should be possible. Â· Principle Four, "Perceptible Information", requires the design to effectively communicate necessary information to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities and it encourages using different modalities (i.e., auditory, visual, tactile) to redundantly present essential information. It is this principle that guides the need for visual representations of auditory information, such as music, to support D/HH people.

Contribution

The research presented in this Dissertation impacts several areas of scholarship: Â· In the field of information presentation, the expressed preferences of d/Deaf and HH participants contribute to new innovative design guidelines for the visualization of auditory information: Â­ the need for visualizations to not be too visually busy, Â­ to focus the core information space in specific areas of the visualization so users do not have to move their eyes around too much, and Â­ to attend carefully to aesthetics and entertainment while still visually presenting auditory information. Â· In the area of accessibility, the research brings new perspectives to our understanding of aging and the impact of hearing loss. Â­ interview participants spoke of loss of connection not just socially but also to their past (e.g., no longer hearing the songs they once loved).

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

9.4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Â· Within usability, this research tells us that D/HH music consumers exist and what they say their needs are. One novel finding of this Dissertation was the expressed need for lyrics. This finding reveals an ongoing need of D/HH captioning consumers for improved captioning solutions. Â· In the field of Deaf Studies this research adds to the understanding of music and its uses in the cultures of the Deaf and HH. Chapter 4 discussed the various ways these communities engage with their own music as well as the music of the larger hearing community. Â­ the focus groups and surveys showed that there is a strong interest in these communities to explore new ways to engage with music information. ISO has joint committees with the IEC. Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) is responsible for the development, and maintenance of IT standards. Recently a working group of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC35 accepted a proposal to begin development on an International Standard related to captioning to be numbered ISO/IEC 20071-23. This timely research adds to the existing knowledge base used to develop standards for captioning: Â· Without this research, the need to address issues relating to the presentation of music information and the kinds of information on which to focus would have been unknown. The standard under development could have ignored this area of concern and focused more on dialog captioning instead because that area represents the bulk of current captioning research. In the same way, this research will contribute not just to the development of ISO/IEC 20071-23, but might also advance the progress of other international Internet accessibility projects.

9.4

Future Directions

There are several possible future projects from the research presented in this Dissertation: Â· Designing simple representations intended to communicate a sense of what is happening in the music combined with entertaining views. As seen, for example, in Chapter 5, participants found the MAM Part Motion view enjoyable but really liked the Magnetosphere visualization of iTunes. There is a need to find a way to combine both ideas. Â· At times, participants found that they, "could not really connect" to the different visualizations. As one person pointed out, the "music was not conveyed well." This suggests that something was missing in the visual representation. Beyond the need to identify the properties of music which people find entertaining, there is a need to capture that part of music which people internalize. Â· There is a need to explore combinations of different forms of music information representation to visualize specific music information. The findings in Chapter 4 suggest high individual difference. While many participants in that study showed a clear interest in lyrics, song information, instruments, and rhythm / beat, others showed an interest in notes or the speed of music. 167

9.4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Â· While it appears that viewers of music visualizations are able to have some emotional experience of the visualization, this experience is not necessarily the same as that of the hearing listener of the music or even the same as that intended by the creator / performer of the music. There is a need to better understand the conveyance of emotion via visualizations of music, determine if there is a need for D/HH audiences to have an "equivalent" emotional experience, and explore ways to create greater and/or equivalent emotional experiences. Â· No one develops an understanding of music without a lifetime of exposure. Given that hearing children develop a knowledge of music as a result of repeated exposure starting at a very young age, it would be useful to understand whether D/HH people, adults in particular, would benefit from frequent, repeated exposure and training to music information presentations (including visualizations). Â· Design and test viable solutions that can be applied to screened devices of all sizes when and where visualization / captions are desired. As shown in Chapter 7, D/HH music consumers do use small devices (e.g., mobile phones, iPods, etc.) to listen to music but they are faced with barriers such as the display of captions, if the device even supports such captions for music. Â· Develop new ways for D/HH users to control the display of captions. The comments collected for the study in Chapter 4 suggest that, with respect to music, there is a need to explore appropriate ways for users to have more control over the presence and more options to control the presentation of captions. Â· Given the strong expressed desire for lyrics in the results of Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the clear sense that D/HH adults do not feel that their needs are met by current music captioning approaches as shown in the results of Chapter 4, a usability study on the presentation of lyrics is needed. Â· Design a means to support tasks that involve music without forcing one's entire attention to the music. The approaches to music visualization explored in this Dissertation would require a person to only watch the visualization when it is in use. If the music in question is being presented as part of another entertainment experience (e.g., while watching a movie), this approach to visualization would be inappropriate because it would not allow the user to attend to other information (e.g., the moving picture, dialogue captions, etc.). Thus there is a need to develop ways to blend different visual presentations of information.

9.4.1

Example Future Study

A future project from the research presented in this Dissertation would be a usability study on the presentation of lyrics. Lyrics are currently presented either via televised captioned commercial music videos or online videos of various captioning quality. A set of commercial captioned music videos would be compared to other ways of presenting lyrics to determine what is missing in the HH experience. The lyric presentation styles might include a notepad-like window that presents scrollable static 168

CHAPTER 9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

9.4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Figure 9.1: FLOE Project Video Player showing transcript view of lyrics. lyrics (e.g., iTunes style presentation), or a video with embedded synchronized captioned lyrics. Information could be collected from participants to understand the types of options they might want / need to control the presentation of captions as well as develop an understanding of the various usability issues each presentation style raises. One option for presenting synchronized captioned lyrics is to use a web browser with an HTML5 compatible video player. One current standard for encoding captions is Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT) (Pfeiffer, JÃ¤genstedt, & Hickson, 2015). HTML5 compatible video players are able to accept multiple audio or timed text tracks (e.g., captions, subtitles, etc.) for the same video content. Using WebVTT, it is possible to caption a video and set different font attributes and behaviours throughout the timed text track with a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). An option for presenting scrollable static lyrics might be the HTML5 video player developed for the FLOE Project by the Inclusive Design Research Centre at The Ontario College of Art and Design University. Shown in Figure 9.1, this video player offers a transcript viewer alongside the video. Using this scrollable transcript viewer, one can watch a music video and follow the lyrics. Open-ended interviews with some questionnaires could be used to collect information on responses to each presentation approach. Adding an eye-tracker may also help to understand the degree viewers attend to the text vs. the video. Sound would be presented for all experiments. As part of the research for this Dissertation, an attempt was made over a two year period to conduct this very usability study. After collecting the lyrics for various songs and having them checked for their correctness, the music videos for these songs were captioned. At first, this captioning was attempted using the proprietary scripting scheme of the EnACT tool, however this was not successful because the tool, which is based on Flash, was no longer stable. Captioning was instead completed using MovieCaptioner (SynchriMedia, 2015), which supports multiple formats including open standards such as WebVTT. The transcript view was created using the FLOE Project video player mentioned above. The corrected lyrics were adapted and reformatted for use in this tool. In addition to the captioned video stimuli, questionnaires and interview scripts were developed for use in this study. The NASA TLX, a standardized survey (Hart, 2006), was to be used to assess the participant's subjective workload when viewing the videos. Because this questionnaire uses a very 169

small font, it was adapted to a larger font to support the potential of elderly participants attending the usability study (recall that 17 people, or 18.1% of those who participated in the various experiments reported in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, were over 65). A significant challenge was experienced when attempting to source an eye-tracking system. A portable system was found. It used a laptop that was poorly underpowered for the software and peripherals it was required to support. As a result, the eye-tracking software was unable to record any data until a new computer could be found to support it. Eventually, the time spent on this project exceeded what was available.

Conclusion

Music is a widely shared form of expression. It is found in all human cultures. Music is enjoyed on its own and for its own sake as well as in groups as part of a social experience. The D/HH communities have formed their own musical traditions and interests. Thus, while the social bonds formed by music do not exclude the D/HH communities, the barriers they experience to access the music of the larger hearing community do. As mentioned in Section 2.7.4 on page 49, using music visualizations has many advantages for D/HH people. However, the visualization of music as a means to support the understanding and entertainment of D/HH music consumers needs more development. Across all of the experiments completed for this Dissertation, only six participants indicated that they did not like music or did not see the point of music. Large numbers of members of the D/HH communities repeatedly expressed a strong interest in the further development of this area of musical expression. Design is iterative. Providing lyrics is an important area of information for this population. New visualizations that explore types of invisible music information not addressed in this Dissertation, or take a different approach to visibly presenting the types of music information that have been explored in this Dissertation, will need to be developed and feedback from the D/HH communities obtained as this process continues. The road to making the invisible visible still has many yet to be seen obstacles.

I do not often know what the lyrics are, but I love the beats and rhythm. I am a skating coach and only listen to music with no lyrics, so I do love that. When I first became able to hear ( via a cochlear implant ) I was elated. I felt part of the world ! I am still amazingly grateful. Yet I still cannot "overhear" as I would love to do, I cannot understand lyrics or plays or the phone,enough to pick up messages or pick it up every time it rings. But I do love music, even though I know I am getting but a shadow of the real thing.

47487254 47491187 I played the piano proficiently, classical and jazz, at one time. Can no longer understand the racket. My "frequency detectors" do not allow for "music" and it is not what I knew for the former 60 plus years. Five years ago I was a candidate for a CI. I refused it. I could hear nothing but garbage trucks (sometimes) going past me on the street, or the odd loud bang or thump. This for seven months. I was offered a fast track CI in Vancouver and turned it down considering my efforts at hearing exercises a potential. Less than three weeks later, I was hearing again. Slowly at first, then better until I had regained 70-80% of my former disability. I really must continue that "exercise" program. It was spawned by a Dr. Weil of the U.S., who believe "concentration of the mind" had the power to heal. I used it for my cancer and it may have helped the healing process. I decided to use the methods, somewhat object derived, to attempt to correct my hearing loss. Something worked after seven long months of speech-reading that actually became quite proficient. Unfortunately, hearing has partially destroyed or weakened that capacity. Another exercise I must continue. Life has its challenges, but where would we be without them? No music for me - I will skip some groups here, though I do see below you could possibly find ways to "recall" some "memories" that could prove enjoyable for some, painful for others, especially those who may have played instruments and now can no longer distinguish their "voice" or those who were close the musician. 47494188 47498333 47511325 47523315 47676073 But classical not pop Continued on next page Although I play piano \

I have been in band since the 7th grade and continue to play and enjoy musical instruments.

CC on TV are usually too far behind the actual words so possibly this would help keep up plus know what words are being sung by which person. 47947726 47961114 47999492 48011515 48012389 48012397 48021291 48054622 Continued on next page On my walkman etc., I find classical music very relaxing I do lot of reading song lyric and think of a way to translate/ express into ASL I didn't really pay attention to the song. I was focused on the captioning effects and found them irritating and frustrating. All the time until I loss my hearing 100% two years ago. the music helps me to relax. I can't hear the music but I can read close capital with music I can listen to music by the beat and sound but can't hear the words. It would be good to include captions in music videos on youtube, etc... vibration or loud I love afterburner by jet planes and also loud racing cars along spectator area I am full deaf frequency_comment I would not chose that kind of music.

LOVE IT! I wish very much I could understand music. I wish I had a person who could talk to me about music and explain and answer my questions. Some voices are literally thrilling to listen to. I wish I could identify the instruments. I wish I knew what people talk about when they discuss music. I wish I could sing, or play an instrument myself. I like to watch captioned movies that talk about composers and their works. I have met people who are able to tell which CONDUCTOR is playing a piece ! also many who can identify who is singing a piece on the radio, or what the music is etc. I would love to see more TV programs that have captions to tell, who it is, what they are playing etc etc and more history about the piece.

Music tunes out my tinnitus. I borrow quite a lot of musical CD's and DVD's from the library. I am always disappointed if the lyrics are not included in the package, because I like to try and follow along. I think this should be mandatory! In the past, I've tried to get the lyrics from the Internet, but this is time consuming, looking up each song. I have a CD (Frosty the Snowman) which is apparently superb, but I still cannot get the lyrics. I don't understand printed music.

nothing pick up check on above. loud at airshows and motorsports I love. Because Television is visually - great for all Deaf and Hard of Hearing People. Like the feeling of vibration

I don't watch the music.

Wish they include captioning on Internet!!! also with the vehicle with my music on with DVD or tapes ON Radio in the car on the way to work and traveling in general, and at home on my mp3 player and iPod

I like when songs are captioned in text in italic writing with the music notes. However, I wish there was sometimes a little more info on the beats and rhythm. Radio input would be nice. I don't know how to find programs that I could benefit from. I would need a synopsis and what to listen for. The one type of program I detest is one with a laugh track.

Deaf people like loud bass than high pitch because it is feeling vibration.

Do not use scroll format!! Use pop up, left to right, right to left, do not cover the subtitle, do not use on top covering faces or half of faces! If there are subtitles (for names for a few seconds), use captioning on bottom and put subtitles (for names for a few second) on top as it is there for a few seconds. We ARE USED TO seeing captioning on the bottom until someone has the stupid idea putting captioning on the top all the time even subtitles were there for a few seconds. Put captioning on bottom, put subtitles on top!! Hearing has to learn to accept it or tough luck!!

I was told to stop singing. I sensed that my music teacher really hated me as she gave so much body language !

We learned to read music and sang a great deal. rhythm class was fun sometimes

HaHa! should deafer take music course at school uh? bands parade and cheerleaders sport events..

I did not take any music classes because I was not able to hear the notes or the sound of music. Although I wear two hearing aids and I can hear well but I can't listen to the radio because all i can hear is mumbling. I can communicate by reading lips and with help of my hearing aids.

Some computer software programs show a musical instrument followed by the sound it makes, which can be played and replayed over again, so this is a graphic way of explaining a sound which is fun to see. I am always grateful if I am told about similar music oriented sites to give one an identifiable music experience. I am chair of a group of people who have had cochlear implants. Many of them are very interested in extending their musical experience with their new hearing, which is really a sound that they must retrain their brains to understand with differing degrees of success. Any URLS of Internet websites which you know of, or think might be useful to us, I would appreciate. Also, with this questionnaire, the very first question gave me trouble. Since I have absolutely no hearing whatsoever ( any remaining is destroyed by the CI operation), I ticked 'Deaf' but that is not right, because, with the CI I have, I do have about 70% hearing and can respond to a question from my husband when I am in the basement and he is upstairs...

general_comments This section has been most difficult for me. I spent hours at the piano, daily, composing or just roaming over the keyboard creating for the moment. I deeply miss that experience. I heard music fine until Nov 2002. I lost that capacity after a construction concussion during interior renovation. Have not heard music, records, tapes, television, symphonies since; nothing. I find most music a screeching mishmash of Chinese-sounding (no offense, please) incomprehensibilities. I truly wish my `ear-exercises' could dismiss the lot. As I say, I must return to the fray, regroup, and carry on. Thanks for listening.

47494188 47498333 47511325 47523315 47676073 47682913 Early in the survey there was a question asking if I watch captioned television. I need to clarify my answer. I never watch television and therefore do not use captions. However, I do watch videos and do use captions. 47686754 47688507 47691450 such an interesting survey Â­ leads me into thinking that there's a possibility of some sort of revolution to how songs should be captioned, word for word with emotions as opposed to just plain text and/or ASL - which I am all for! 47702807 47704808 47705875 Keep study and more ideas for deaf to watch or feeling at same level of hearing people to listen. Thanks for your study and consideration. My name is XXXXXXX 47708238 47715500 47744252 47749373 47749983 47750309 47751515 I would like to see improvements of closed captions on dvd movies and television with clearier, bigger and colour words. (Not black or white) White closed captions is okay if it has a black background behind the words. If without black background, then its harder to read plain white words. I preferably yellow closed captions if it has no background to it. Continued on next page nothing of i am full deaf! First time to see this kind video Would be interesting to see more and decide

general_comments As a Deaf person, I do not particularly care about music being conveyed through captions.

Captions are very important and should be more widely used. However, until it is easier for content providers it probably won't gain as much ground as it could. Deaf like to watch music with video and close capital.

Do not EVER change any wordings even swearing or omit them!!. Must caption every word as heard. if it goes bleep, then type bleep but if it goes saying Fuck or what ever, type Fuck, etc. Must type everything as heard, do not ever change or cover while the audio is still there. It is unfair to deaf parents not knowing that the audio for swearing is still there and the children heard them! It is an insult that they do that to us!!

47836741 47848085 47864497

Hopefully successful in the future. I loved the music or other to listen the words Generally speaking...the most effective way in my opinion of understanding what is going on with music or television is to have the closed captioning on and steady and level.

47941605

I have Ushers Syndrome. Although the yellow text was a good colour combo with dark background it was hard to go back and forth when the text faded out. Over all I like the idea.

47947726 47961114 47972708 47999492 48011515 Another suggestion, why not have ASL song translation in the corner of the tv screen or video frame like they use in the Government network, QSL. ASL can follow the song lyric 48012389 48012397 48021291 48054622 Closed captioning is very important to me. I did not actually get a video, just the words, so I pictured a lot. no comment. I appreciated that I helped you with improving in development that Deaf people's needs.

Consent to Participate in Study from Subject Information Form
The purpose of this study is to evaluate different way of presenting music visually. In order to do this, we will ask you to watch eight different examples of these visualizations and provide us with your opinion about them. Each example runs between one and two minutes. You are also asked to complete two additional surveys, one prior to the study and one at the conclusion of the study. Confidentiality All raw data will be kept strictly confidential; however a summary of the data will be published in academic venues but no individual details will be identified in this summary. The information gathered from surveys will be strictly used for research and academic purposes with only the principal investigator and his supervisor having access to it Risks and Discomforts The risks associated with participating in this study are minimal. You may experience some fatigue with watching the visualizations. However, you are able to take breaks at any time or even stop participation in the study without penalty. You may also experience some discomfort with being filmed or audio recorded. In this case, you may choose not to participate in the study or record your opinions in writing and remain off camera. Expected Benefits Individual participants will not receive any direct benefits; however, this study will benefit the general community of audio description users. This study will test different styles of audio description that will assist in developing new practises for audio description. We hope that this information may lead to improvements in audio description technologies and techniques. Voluntary Nature of Participation: Participation in this study is entirely voluntary.

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: ARE YOU SET? ARE YOU READY? OKAY. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. MY NAME IS DAVID, AND THIS IS MY SIGN NAME. I SIGN, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T THINK AND SIGN AT THE SAME TIME, SO I'M GOING TO ASK TALA (PH.) AND JENNIFER TO BE OUR INTERPRETERS TODAY. NOW, WHAT I'LL DO IS JUST QUICKLY INTRODUCE YOU TO THE OTHER RESEARCHERS IN THE ROOM. IN THE BACK CORNER OVER HERE IS JORGE. WAVE. OKAY. THAT'S JORGE. THE WOMAN OVER HERE IS DEB FELS WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER IN THE STUDY. THE GENTLEMAN HERE IS DOUG, AND HE WILL BE RUNNING OUR MOVIES TODAY. THIS GENTLEMAN IS QUOC, AND THAT WOMAN OVER THERE IS LIDA. NOW, LET ME SORT OF EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY, AND THEN WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE. SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY IS WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A BUNCH OF VIDEOS -- COME IN, COME IN. OKAY. DO YOU NEED A PEN? OKAY. SO AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER, WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS WE'RE GOING TO DO RESEARCH ON MUSIC, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY PLAY MUSIC. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ANYTHING. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TRY DIFFERENT WAYS OF VISUALIZING MUSIC. WE'RE GOING TO PUT A VIDEO ON THIS SCREEN OVER HERE TO MY RIGHT, AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU WATCH IT AND THINK ABOUT IT, AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS FILL OUT A QUICK QUESTIONNAIRE, AND LIDA, OVER HERE WILL PICK THEM UP, AND THEN WE WILL GO TO THE NEXT VIDEO. AND THAT'S THE IDEA. WHAT WE NEED IS WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS OF MAKING MUSIC MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME, WHO ARE HARD OF HEARING, OR LIKE YOU WHO ARE DEAF, AND WE'RE HOPING THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO IT IS TO MAKE IT VISUAL, DEB (COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE. COULD NOT SEE SPEAKER): CAN I JUST DO AN ACCESS CHECK? DAVID: OKAY. CAN EVERYBODY SEE THE SCREEN? (JUST DISCUSSING SEATING). DAVID: NOW, FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR FORMS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILL IT OUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. IF YOU WANT TO USE SIGN TO FILL OUT THE FORM, JUST TELL ONE OF THE INTERPRETERS, OKAY, AND WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE WILL HAVE QUOC OR JORGE WILL FILM YOU, AND THEY WILL RECORD WHAT YOU SAID, AND THEN GO FROM THERE. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILL OUT EVERYTHING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION, AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO IS, YOU KNOW, RAISE YOUR HAND AND GO ONE AT A TIME. AND THAT'S FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. THE CAPTIONER CAN ONLY REALLY WORK WITH ONE PERSON AT A TIME, AND THE INTERPRETER CAN ONLY REALLY WORK WITH ONE PERSON AT A TIME, AND WE DON'T WANT THEM TO, YOU KNOW, GO INSANE ON US, SO, RIGHT? SO BEFORE I

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

BEGIN, BEFORE I GET YOU INTO YOUR PACKAGES, DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE I GET STARTED? DAVID: NO? YOU'RE GOOD? OKAY. SO IN YOUR PACKAGE, WHAT YOU'LL FIND -AND I'M SORRY, THEY ARE THICK. FIRST YOU WILL HAVE FOUND THIS. HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE ALL READ IT. THIS LITTLE TWO-PAGE THING, YOU GET TO TAKE THIS HOME WITH YOU, OKAY. SO YOU CAN TAKE THIS HOME WITH YOU. THIS IS INFORMATION ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING, OKAY. IT IS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STUDY IS ALL ABOUT FOR FUTURE INFORMATION. NOW, THIS IS THE CONSENT FORM. IF YOU HAVE SIGNED IT ALREADY, LIDA WILL GO AROUND AND SHE WILL PICK IT UP. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SIGN THIS, IF YOU WANT TO VIDEO RECORD A SIGNED CONSENT -- A CONSENT IN ASL, JUST RAISE YOUR HAND AND QUOC WILL VIDEO RECORD YOUR CONSENT IN ASL. SO IF YOU CAN PLEASE SIGN THIS FORM OR RAISE YOUR HAND AND ASK FOR QUOC, AND THEN LIDA WILL COME AROUND AND PICK THEM UP. SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO. PARTICIPANT 1: SHOULD WE GIVE IT TO LIDA NOW, OR ARE WE WAITING? DAVID: YEAH, LIDA. SHE'S GOING TO COME AROUND RIGHT NOW. DAVID: AND THEN THE OTHER THING WE NEED YOU TO FILL OUT -- NO, I'M GOING TO WAIT. I'LL WAIT. DAVID: IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO ALREADY, CAN YOU PLEASE FILL OUT OUR PRESTUDY QUESTIONNAIRE. THIS IS THE QUESTIONNAIRE THAT JUST TELLS US -OH, I'M SORRY. DAVID: OKAY. IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO ALREADY PLEASE FILL OUT THE PRESTUDY QUESTIONNAIRE. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. YOU HAVE DONE IT? OKAY. SO LIDA WILL BE PICKING UP THOSE. (DISCUSSING CAMERA SETTINGS) QUOC: S0 WE'RE READY. DAVID: OKAY. WE'RE GOOD. SO IN YOUR PACKAGE, YOU HAVE A STACK OF QUESTIONNAIRES THAT LOOK LIKE THIS. YOU HAVE ABOUT 30 OF THEM. WE'RE ONLY GOING TO USE 28, BUT YOU HAVE SPARES, SO THAT'S GOOD. NOW, LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN A MOMENT IS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A VISUALIZATION OF A SONG. IT WILL BE ABOUT 30 SECONDS LONG, OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A -- IT WILL BE A WEIRD LOOKING PICTURE AND IT'S ONLY A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT WILL BE DONE. WHEN IT'S DONE, WHAT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS FILL OUT THIS FORM. NOW, AS I SAID BEFORE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, YOU CAN DO IT IN SIGN INSTEAD. JUST

251

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

RAISE YOUR HAND, AND QUOC WILL COME AROUND WITH EITHER JENNIFER OR TALA AND TAKE YOUR COMMENTS. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS? PARTICIPANT 5 (MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE. THE PERSON WAS BLOCKED): HOW OFTEN WILL WE BE SHOWING THE VISUALIZATION? PARTICIPANT 5: (NOT VOICED). DAVID: WHAT WERE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A VISUALIZATION ABOUT 30 SECONDS LONG AND THEN WE WILL FILL OUT THIS, AND THEN WE WILL DO IT AGAIN AND FILL OUT THIS AND THEN DO IT AGAIN AND FILL OUT THIS. AFTER WE HAVE DONE 7 OF THESE, THEN WE ARE GOING TO STOP FOR A LITTLE BIT, TAKE A BIT OF A BREATHER, AND THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE WILL DO SOME DISCUSSIONS. PARTICIPANT 6: THERE'S A WARNING OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE, ARE WE GOING TO BE SENT OFF TO A HOSPITAL AFTER THIS? I'M WONDERING WHAT THIS WARNING IS ALL ABOUT. DAVID: I'M VERY GLAD YOU ASKED. SO THE UNIVERSITY FORCES US TO MAKE SURE WE SAY CERTAIN THINGS IN OUR INFORMATION FORMS ALL THE TIME. ONE OF THEM IS A WARNING THAT YOU MAY BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY HARMED. WE DON'T EXPECT THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY HARMED. YOU MAY FEEL A LITTLE BIT TIRED AFTER SEEING, YOU KNOW, 20 OF THESE BEFORE WE GET TO THE LAST ONE. THAT I'M EXPECTING, BUT WE'RE HOPING WE'RE NOT SENDING YOU TO ST. MIKES WHEN WE'RE DONE. YES. PARTICIPANT 4: SO THERE'S NO DANGER OF ME WANTING TO SMOKE UP AFTERWARDS. DAVID: I'M NOT SAYING THAT, AND I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR. PARTICIPANT 4: OH, OKAY. NOT THAT I'M IN THE HABIT, NO. I DON'T INHALE. DAVID: OH, I'M GOING TO HAVE FUN TODAY.

PARTICIPANT 8: YEAH, IT JUST THAT I HAVE A CLASS. DEB: DAVID, DAVID? DAVID: YUP, WE'RE GOING TO TRY. WE'RE GOING TO TRY FOR 5:30. DAVID: SO LET'S GO. DOUG. THAT'S YOUR CUE. (BLOCK 1, SONG 1). DAVID: OKAY. CANT SEE SPEAKER: THAT'S ALL? THAT'S IT. DAVID: YEAH, THAT'S IT. JUST ABOUT 30 SECONDS. THAT'S IT. SO FILL OUT THE FORM, AND WE WILL SET UP FOR THE NEXT ONE. PARTICIPANT 1: THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE, CORRECT? DAVID: YEAH, THAT WAS THE FIRST SONG, YES. PARTICIPANT 4: IT SAID, WHAT WAS THE ENERGY LEVEL OF THE MUSIC, THERE'S NO MUSIC, RIGHT? DAVID: THERE'S NO SOUND. SO IT'S VISUALIZING MUSIC BUT THERE'S NO SOUND. PARTICIPANT 4: OH, OKAY. OKAY. PARTICPANT 9: THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE MUSIC, MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU HEAR. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT. THAT'S NOT REALLY MUSIC TO ME. DAVID: OK, THAT'S FINE. IT'S VISUAL MUSIC. UNKNOWN: DAVID, I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING THE QUESTION. CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THE QUESTION? DAVID: OKAY, SURE SO YOUR QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEEDED TO FILL OUT THE WHOLE FORM, IS THAT CORRECT? PARTICIPANT 9: I HAVE TO?

253

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: NO. PARTICIPANT 9: I DON'T HAVE TO. OKAY. DAVID: NO. ONLY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE. DAVID: OKAY. SO HAS EVERYBODY GIVEN THEIR FORM TO LIDA. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL YOUR FORMS GO TO LIDA JUST BEFORE WE START. UNFORTUNATELY, I KNOW THAT REALLY SLOWS IT DOWN. DAVID: OKAY. SO LET ME EXPLAIN THIS ONE VERY QUICKLY. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS YOU'RE SEEING -- LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE ARE FANS. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL FANS. EACH OF THESE GRAPHICS REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT, OR IN THIS CASE, A SINGER IF THERE IS ONE. AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE COLOURS RUN THROUGH THIS. OKAY. MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUNDS WORK BEST FOR YOU THIS ONE? THIS ONE? THIS ONE? OR -PARTICIPANT 1, 2, 7, 8 AND MAYBE MORE: THE FIRST ONE, THE FIRST ONE. PARTICIPANT 7: ACTUALLY THE BLACK ONE WAS BETTER. DAVID: OK, SO THE SECOND ONE PARTICPANT 1: NO, I LIKED THE FIRST ONE BETTER. PARTICIPANT 7: COME ON! THE BLACK ONE IS BETTER. PARTICIPANT 1: THE FIRST ONE. DAVID: THIS ONE? SO IS THIS OKAY? OKAY. SO WE WILL GO FOR THIS ONE. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS THE COLOURS MOVE FROM HERE IN TOWARDS THE CENTRE. OKAY? ( BLOCK 1, SONG 2) DAVID: OKAY. SO FILL OUT THE FORM. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK. THE COLOUR -I SHOULD SAY -- I WILL WAIT. DAVID: OKAY. SO IF YOU ARE DONE, PLEASE HAND IT OFF TO LIDA. DAVID: SO THE NEXT VISUALIZATION WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU IS WHAT WE -SORRY. WE REFER TO THIS AS A FLASHING SUN. SO BASICALLY IT'S AN OVAL THAT'S GOING TO PULSE. OKAY. READY? (BLOCK 1, SONG 3).

254

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: OK READY? SO AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO USE THE FANS. OKAY. LETS GO. (BLOCK 1, SONG 4) DAVID: OKAY. PARTICIPANT 4: POKAROO (LAUGHS). PARTICIPANT 6: IS THAT THE SAME AS BEFORE OR IS IT DIFFERENT? DAVID: IT WAS DIFFERENT. PARTICIPANT 6: IT KINDOF LOOKED THE SAME. DAVID: THAT'S FINE. OKAY. DAVID: SO OUR NEXT ONE -- OH. OKAY. SO OUR NEXT ONE, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IS WE'RE GOING TO USE SORT OF A FIREWORKS EFFECT. SO EACH OF THE BURSTS ARE GOING TO, I GUESS, GOING TO BE MEANINGFUL TO MUSIC. I SHOULD SAY, BY THE WAY, IN THE ONE WE WERE JUST SEEING, THE ONE WE JUST FINISHED SEEING, YOU WERE ASKING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT. THEY ARE DIFFERENT. BUT IF YOU NOTICED THE COLOURED CIRCLES, THAT'S INTENDED TO BE SORT OF A BEAT EFFECT. UNFORTUNATELY, I COULDN'T TELL YOU THAT BEFORE PLAYING IT. AND THEN THE FANS, THE WAY THE COLOUR THAT IS SHOOTING OUT OR IN, IT IS SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU WHAT THE -- WHAT NOTE IS BEING PLAYED, HOW LONG THAT NOTE IS, THAT KIND OF THING. BUT THAT'S WHAT IS BEING COMMUNICATED. ARE WE READY? PARTICIPANT 1: I THINK YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN, BECAUSE YOU WERE TALKING AT THE SAME TIME AS IT WAS BEING SHOWN. DAVID: SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. OKAY. YOU HAVE TO WARN ME UNKNOWN: SORRY ABOUT THAT. (BLOCK 1, SONG 5) DAVID: OKAY. SORRY ABOUT THE DELAY. WE HAD A SOFTWARE ISSUE. BUT DOUG TELLS ME WE'RE GOOD TO GO. OKAY. OKAY. SO IS EVERYONE READY? EVERYONE IS READY? (BLOCK 1, SONG 6). DAVID: OKAY. (DISCUSSING CAMERA SETTINGS)

255

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: OKAY SO THIS IS THE LAST VISUALIZATION FOR THIS FIRST BLOCK OF 7. AND I'LL JUST QUICKLY EXPLAIN. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, EACH OF THESE GROUPS OF LINES REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT. DAVID: OKAY. IS EVERYONE READY? (BLOCK 1, SONG 7). DAVID: THERE. PARTICIPANT 1: (SIGNS) TALA: (WHISPER PARTICIPANT 1'S QUESTION TO DAVID) DAVID: SHE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO EXPRESS THE MUSIC GOING UP AND DOWN. IS THAT FREQUENCY, PITCH, WHAT IS THAT? AND SO WHATEVER WORD WORKS FOR YOU. PARTICIPANT 1: OK THANKS. PARTICIPANT 4: I UNDERSTAND THE LAST ONE, BUT ME, I HAVE NOTICED SINCE THE FIRST ONE, ONE QUESTION. WHAT DOES THE VISUALIZATION MEAN TO YOU? I'M ALWAYS ANSWERING WITH ONE OR TWO WORDS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? FOR EXAMPLE, THE LAST ONE REMINDED ME OF STAR WARS 3. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOUR RESEARCH OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW. DAVID: I DON'T KNOW. YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU NEVER KNOW. SO THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. HOW IS THIS WORKING FOR YOU GUYS? WAS THERE A PARTICULAR VISUALIZATION THAT YOU REALLY LIKED SO FAR? PARTICIPANT 1: SOME WERE NOT BAD. SOME I LIKED THEM. DAVID: ARE THERE SOME THAT YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE? PARTICIPANT 2: THE LAST ONE. UNKNOWN: YEAH, I AGREE. DAVID: AND SO WHY DO YOU NOT LIKE IT? PARTICIPANT 2: IT'S LIKE GOING TO THE ORCHESTRA OR SOMETHING? PARTICIPANT 1: YEAH YOU KNOW, THE LEVELS. I CAN RECOGNIZE THERE ARE LEVELS GOING UP AND DOWN, BUT IN TERMS OF IT --IT'S STILL SLOW AND IS STILL A LITTLE FLAT. THE COLOURS ARE VERY CONFUSING. IF IT WAS THE SAME COLOUR, PERHAPS SHOWING LIKE AN EQUALIZER, YOU CAN MAYBE SEE IT. BUT THE DIFFERENT LINES, THERE WAS A DISCONNECT FOR ME.

256

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

PARTICIPANT 8: IT LOOKS LIKE THE LINES ON AN EKG MACHINE, THE LAST ONE. THE HEART MONITOR, LIKE THE UP AND DOWN OF A HEART MONITOR. DAVID: I WAS TOLD ACTUALLY THE MODEL WAS MORE LIKE A PIANO ROLL, LIKE AN OLD ANTIQUE PIANO YOU JUST TAKE A ROLL OF PAPER WITH THE PUNCHES IN IT...YEAH I WAS TOLD THAT IS WHAT THE MODEL IS. PARTICIPANT 10: I WAS GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE FIRST OR THE SECOND ONE THAT WAS SO COLOURFUL THAT WAS LIKE STAR WARS. I LIKED LOOKING AT IT, BUT BECAUSE THE CONCEPT IS SO DIFFERENT, I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD RELATE IT TO MUSIC, ACTUALLY. BUT IT WAS VERY VISUALLY APPEALING. DAVID: SO, SO FAR, IF WE WERE TO TALK ABOUT MUSIC, DO THESE VISUALIZATIONS GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED? UNKNOWN: NO. DAVID: NO? PARTICIPANT 1: IN TERMS OF THE ONES WITH THE DOTS WITH THE COLOUR DOTS, YOU GET A SENSE MORE OF -- SORT OF REMINDS ME OF LIKE DRUMS, A BEAT THING. PARTICIPANT 4: I FIND THAT REALLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, TO GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT AND THINK ABOUT IT MORE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WE HAVE TO DO IT FAST, FAST, FAST. I WISH WE HAD A LITTLE MORE TIME. DAVID: WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY AT THIS POINT THAT SORT OF JUST STRIKES YOU AS YOU'RE -PARTICIPANT 9: IT'S STILL NOT MUSIC TO ME. TO ME I CANNOT CONNECT THIS TO MUSIC. EVEN IF YOU DON'T HEAR, YOU STILL HAVE A SENSE OF THE VIBRATION RINGING. BUT THIS IS JUST PICTURES HERE. THERE'S NO VIBRATION. PARTICIPANT 1: YEAH, IT'S INTERESTING. SOME OF IT I FEEL LIKE, OH, YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT MUSIC MIGHT LOOK LIKE. BUT IN TERMS OF -- I AGREE, I AGREE WITH WHAT SHE'S SAYING, THAT IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF VIBRATION OR SOMETHING WHILE WE HAD THE VISUALIZATION, YOU WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT TACTILE RESPONSE. SO MAYBE THERE'S A CONNECT BETWEEN THAT BUT AS YOU WATCH THE VIDEO, I CAN MAYBE ENVISION WHAT THE MUSIC MIGHT BE. NOT COMPLETELY, BUT I GET A SENSE. SO MAYBE IF THERE'S MORE OF A STIMULUS, THEN YOU COULD PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. DAVID: YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT HALF AND HALF.

257

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

PARTICIPANT 1: YES. PARTICIPANT 9: LIKE WHAT SHE'S SAYING. I HAVE TO IMAGINE WHAT THIS IS LIKE MYSELF. THIS IS WORK. IT'S NOT ENJOYMENT. IT'S NOT COMING TO ME. I HAVE TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO VISUALIZE AND DEVELOP SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I SEE. IT IS LIKE WORK. PARTICIPANT 10: I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT I HAVE TO MENTION THAT FOR ME IT IS LIKE WORK TO TAKE PART IN A CONVERSATION AS WELL. THAT'S HARD WORK, LISTENING AND TRYING TO HEAR, SO. DAVID: I WAS SORT OF THINKING THE SAME THING. FOR HARD OF HEARING PEOPLE, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK INVOLVED JUST TRYING TO FOCUS ON A CONVERSATION. DAVID: ANY OTHER THOUGHTS? ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? OKAY. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT SET OF VIDEOS. UNKNOWN: ARE YOU GOING TO DESCRIBE IT? DAVID: NO. (BLOCK 2. SONG 1). DAVID: OKAY. DAVID: SO THIS IS OUR FLASHING SUN VIEW AGAIN. (BLOCK 2. SONG 2) DAVID: OKAY. DAVID: IS EVERYONE READY? IS EVERYONE READY? OKAY. SO ONCE AGAIN, WE'RE BACK TO THE FANS. I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT, SOMEBODY ASKED WHAT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES WERE. A LOT OF THE DIFFERENCES YOU MAY SEE IS AS THE COLOURS GO OUT, OKAY, ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS HOW THE COLOUR DECAYS. SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS IT WILL DECAY FROM THE MIDDLE OUTWARD, AND SOMETIMES IT WILL DECAY FROM THE OUTSIDE IN. ALSO, SOMETIMES WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS YOU'LL SEE WE HAVE A LOT MORE OF THESE. SOMETIMES WE ONLY HAVE 3 OR 4. SOMETIMES WE HAVE 5 OR 6. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES. AND, OF COURSE, EACH OF THESE REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS IN THE SONG. PARTICIPANT 4: YEAH, I HAVE NOTICED FOR MYSELF, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENT COLOURS, WHEN I SEE THE PICTURES OF THE FANS, I'M JUST GOING BORING, YOU KNOW.

258

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: THAT'S A FAIR COMMENT. PARTICIPANT 4: NOT LIKE THE FIRST ONE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, WHICH WAS MORE COLOURFUL. DAVID: ARE YOU READY? LET'S GET STARTED. (BLOCK 2. SONG 3). DAVID: OKAY. SO THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE -- THIS ONE WILL BE ANOTHER MOVING PICTURE AGAIN. ARE YOU ALL SET? (BLOCK 2, SONG 4). PARTICIPANT 4: NOW, THAT'S BETTER. (WATCHING VIDEO) DAVID: OKAY. PARTICIPANT 4: IF I HAD A LIGHTER, I WOULD BE FLICKING IT RIGHT NOW. DAVID: ACTUALLY, MY CELL PHONE HAS A LITTLE LIGHTER APPLICATION ON IT, SO WHEN I GO TO A CONCERT AND I'M JUST HOLDING MY CELL PHONE, TURN ON THE LIGHTER AND -- IT'S TRUE. PARTICIPANT 4: COOL. PARTICIPANT 3: I ALSO LIKE IT, BUT I DO NOT LIKE FANS. FANS ARE... PARTICIPANT 7: YOU GETTING TIRED OF WALKING AROUND YET? DAVID: OKAY. IS EVERYONE READY? OH, YOU'RE STILL COLLECTING. SORRY. DAVID: OKAY, LETS GO. (BLOCK 2, SONG 5). DAVID: OKAY. PARTICIPANT 4: CAN I HAND IN A BLANK PAPER? DAVID: IT'S YOUR RIGHT. YOU CAN TELL US AS MUCH AS OR AS LITTLE AS YOU LIKE. PARTICIPANT 4: THANK YOU. I'M CONCERNED. I WANT TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR RESEARCH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BUT THAT PART, HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT? YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

259

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: THAT'S FINE. DAVID: OKAY. SO I WILL JUST QUICKLY EXPLAIN THIS. SO IN THIS PARTICULAR VISUALIZATION, WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE A LINE HERE IN THE MIDDLE, WHICH IS THE TIME POINT IN THE SONG. SO THAT'S YOUR POINT OF REFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE. THE LINE GOING ACROSS THE THING IS TO SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENT VOLUMES OF THE NOTE. EACH OF THESE LINES REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT, AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE CIRCLES HERE, THEY ARE LIKE BALLS, THEY PULSE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THE MUSIC IS SHOWN. IS EVERYONE GOOD TO GO? (BLOCK 2, SONG 6). DAVID: OKAY. PARTICIPANT 4: CAN I BE EXCUSED FOR A FEW MINUTES? I FEEL LIKE HIGH SCHOOL. DAVID: WE'LL TAKE A SHORT BREAK RIGHT NOW. WE WILL TAKE A SHORT BREAK RIGHT NOW. JUST TWO OR THREE MINUTES TO LET HIM GO TO THE WASHROOM AND COME BACK. DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO GO TO THE WASHROOM? PARTICIPANT 7: I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW MY PARKING METRE IS UP UNTIL 5:30. I WONDER IF WE WILL BE DONE SOON. DAVID: YEAH, I'M HOPING TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT -- WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS VISUALIZATION, THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A QUICK DISCUSSION, AND THEN WE WILL DO ONE MORE BLOCK OF 7 WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY WE JUST HAD A DISCUSSION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CUT THIS THING SHORT BECAUSE WE ARE FINDING THIS IS GOING TOO LONG TOO FOR US. PARTICIPANT 6: (NOT VOICED) TALA: IS IT A BREAK RIGHT NOW? DAVID: WASHROOM, YOU GO OUT THE DOOR, YOU GO STRAIGHT DOWN, OR YOU GO UP AND THEN TURN RIGHT AND STRAIGHT DOWN. TALA: THANKS. DAVID: WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE GENTLEMAN TO COME BACK, HOW ARE WE DOING SO FAR? WHAT DO YOU THINK? ARE THERE ANY VISUALIZATION IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU REALLY LIKED SO FAR? PARTICIPANT 7: I PREFER THE COLOUR. I'M KIND OF COLOUR SENSITIVE TO STUFF. IF I SEE NOTHING WITH ANY COLOUR IN IT, THEN I FEEL THAT IT'S NOT VERY INTERESTING. I PREFER THE DESIGN. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT'S

260

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

KIND OF OLD FASHION DOESN'T REALLY APPEAL TO ME. I DON'T KNOW HOW EVERYBODY ELSE FEELS? DAVID: IS THAT KIND OF DESIGN, THAT COLOURFUL EFFECT, IS THAT ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL TO YOU? DO YOU GET AN EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE OUT OF THAT? PARTICIPANT 7: NO, I'M NOT SURE. IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, LIKE STUFF LIKE HOT PINK. I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY WEAR CLOTHES THAT ARE HOT PINK, SO I DON'T REALLY ENJOY LOOKING AT THOSE KINDS OF COLOURS EITHER. PARTIICPANT 8: FOR ME DIFFERENT COLOURS REPRESENT DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. SO THE MORE COLOURFUL, THE MORE I GET OUT OF IT, BUT I ALSO FEEL MORE OF A CONNECTION WITH THE DIFFERENT COLOURS IN THE MUSIC, SO. PARTICIPANT 10: I WAIT FOR IT TO COME UP AND THEN I CAN READ IT. I'M TOO LAZY TO MOVE TO ANOTHER SEAT. DAVID: SO THEN WITH THE STUFF THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU, WHY DOESN'T IT WORK? WHAT MAKES IT SORT OF NOT WORK? I'M SORRY, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. PARTICIPANT 5: NO. PARTICIPANT 9: THIS ONE, YOU KEEP SHOWING IT. IT'S VERY SMALL, AND YOU KEEP SHOWING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. I KNOW THIS IS A GUITAR, BUT WHAT IS THAT ONE? IS IT A PIANO? DAVID: YEAH, THIS ONE IS LIKE AN ORGAN. THIS IS ONE IS I BELIEVE LIKE A GUITAR AND THIS ONE OVER HERE IS A BASS. UKNOWN: YEAH, IT IS LIKE AN ELECTRIC AND THE OTHER ONE IS LIKE AN ACOUSTIC. PARTICIPANT 9: THIS IRRITATES ME BECAUSE I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. IT HAS NO MEANING TO ME. YOU KEEP SHOWING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. DAVID: DOES ANYBODY -- UHM-HMM. PARTICIPANT 3: WE CANNOT CONCENTRATE ON ONE. IT IS MOVING SO FAST, THE COLOURS WITH THE FANS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE SENSE. VERY DIFFICULT. THE FANS. DAVID: IT'S TOO FAST. IT'S ALMOST TOO BUSY? LIKE, HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN IT?

261

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

PARTICIPANT 3: YES. IT'S FAST. IT'S JUST CONFUSING. PARTICIPANT 10: I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE 6 OF THEM, IT'S KIND OF DISTRACTING BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE COLOURS AND YOU'RE LOOKING BACK AND FORTH, AND I THINK THAT THE MEANING IS LOST. MY FAVOURITE IS THE BRIGHT COLOUR. I DO FIND THAT IT'S KIND OF RELATED TO COLOUR. WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT'S INTRIGUING, UPLIFTING, IT MAKES YOU FEEL HAPPIER. IT IS MORE VISUALLY APPEALING, IN MY OPINION, TO WATCH. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT GENTLEMAN OVER THERE. THIS IS A LITTLE BORING. DAVID: YES. PARTICIPANT 2: YOU SEE THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE SEEING IT, BUT WE'RE NOT FEELING ANYTHING, SO IT'S HARD TO... PARTICIPANT 1: IT'S THE SAME IDEA WHEN YOU HAD THE 6 FANS BUT THEN YOU HAD THE COLOURED DOTS, LIKE, THEY SEEMED TO BE MORE CONNECTED. I LIKED THAT. BUT IF THEY ARE ALL GOING OFF AT DIFFERENT TIME AND KIND OF SEPARATELY. THEN IS NOT GOING OFF VERY SMOOTH. PARTICIPANT 9: MY COMMENT IS RELATED TO HERS AND HERS. THERE'S TOO MANY THINGS GOING ON, YOU KNOW, IN ALL SORTS OF DIRECTION. AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE THAT YOU SHOWED US TO THAT ME REMINDED ME OF THE BIG BANG THEORY. IT'S LIKE MY VISION WAS BEING GUIDED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN A WAY THAT WAS MORE RELAXING TO ME. SO IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS BEING PULLED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. DAVID: ANY OTHER COMMENTS? I'M GOING TO SORT OF NOT WAIT FOR HIM ANYMORE. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING. SO DOUG. (DAVID TALKING TO DOUG) DAVID: SORRY. WE HAVE TO FIX A SOFTWARE ISSUE. DAVID: A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU. SO WHEN YOU SEE EACH OF THESE VISUALIZATIONS, ARE YOU PERCEIVING THAT YOU ARE SEEING A DIFFERENT SONG EVERYTIME? DO YOU THINK YOU ARE SEEING THE SAME SONG EVERY TIME? WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? PARTICIPANT 8: I JUST, I FIND I'M SO DISTRACTED BY WHAT'S GOING ON THAT I'M TRYING SO HARD FOR THE DURATION OF THE CLIP TO MAKE SENSE OF IT. SO I'M NOT REALLY FOCUSSED ON GETTING MORE OF A MESSAGE ON IT THAN JUST TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

262

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

PARTICIPANT 1: LIKE I SAID BEFORE, IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAD SOME SORT OF VIBRATIONS, LIKE IF WE WERE ACTUALLY FEELING MUSIC BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONNECTION TO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY FOR HARD OF HEARING PEOPLE, IT IS DIFFERENT, BUT I'M PROFOUNDLY DEAF AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF VIBRATION SENSATION TO GO ALONG WITH THE VISUALIZATION. PARTICIPANT 8: I TOTALLY AGREE. I ALSO THINK THAT, AND NOT MAYBE FOR TODAY BUT SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD, IF YOU COULD ALMOST STANDARDIZE THE COLOURS IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THE COLOURS. SO JUST STANDARDIZE THE COLOURS JUST TO MEAN ONE THING. THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS. THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP TO ME, AND I WOULD PROBABLY GET MORE ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT. DAVID: ALL SET? SO HERE'S THE NEXT ONE. (BLOCK 3, S0NG 1). DAVID: OKAY. PARTICIPANT 4: OH, I MISSED THE CLASSICS. I ONLY SAW THE LAST COUPLE SECONDS. DAVID: WE ACTUALLY JUST STARTED AGAIN WHEN YOU WALKED IN THE DOOR. PARTICIPANT 4: OH, OKAY. FINE. THANK YOU. DAVID: OKAY. SO WE WILL MOVE TO THIS ONE NOW. IS EVERYONE READY? (BLOCK 3, SONG 2). DAVID: OKAY. DAVID: OKAY, SO LET ME EXPLAIN THIS ONE VERY BRIEFLY. WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IN THIS ONE IS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE -- ONE MINUTE. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IN THIS ONE IS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A DOT APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE LINES COME OUT OF THAT DOT, AND THEN YOU WILL SEE COLOURED CIRCLES. THE CIRCLES WILL REPRESENT DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS, AND DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES, DIFFERENT NOTES, AND THEN IT WILL PULSE TO SHOW YOU HOW THE INSTRUMENT IS BEING PLAYED. (BLOCK 3, SONG 5) DAVID: OKAY. THAT'S IT. DAVID: OKAY. SO WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT ONE? WAS THAT AN IMPROVEMENT? OR DID YOU LIKE IT? NO. OKAY.

263

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: OKAY. SO OUR NEXT VISUALIZATION. THIS IS, AGAIN, THE FANS. YOU WILL NOTE THE NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS WE HAVE IN THIS ONE. SO LET'S SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. (BLOCK 4. SONG 1). DAVID: OKAY. DAVID: OKAY. SO JUST A FEW MORE, I PROMISE. WE ARE ALMOST DONE. PARTICIPANT 5: IF IT'S PAST 6 O'CLOCK, I HAVE TO LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE US WITH DINNER, OKAY. DAVID: UHM-HMM. WELL, JUST TWO MORE, THAT'S IT. PARTICIPANT 10: I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT DINNER IS NO GOOD FOR ME BECAUSE IF I DON'T CATCH THE TRAIN AND GET HOME IN TIME, I'M GOING TO MISS "THE BACHELOR". DAVID: I HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. I HAVE TO GET HOME AT A CERTAIN TIME OR I MISS "HEROS". SO WE ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO. (BLOCK 4, SONG 4). DAVID: THAT'S IT. DAVID: SO WHAT DID YOU FOLKS THINK OF THE LAST ONE YOU JUST SAW. SORRY. WHAT DID YOU FOLKS THINK OF THE LAST ONE YOU JUST SAW? BETTER? NO? PARTICIPANT 6: I FEEL LIKE IT'S SIMILAR TO AN OLD AVC TEST WHERE YOU FLIP IT AND IT'S JUST CHARTED. NO MEANING FOR ME PARTICIPANT 7: IT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING AS THE ONE -- I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S SIMILAR TO ALL THE ONES BEFORE IT. IT'S JUST LIKE DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME SORT OF FEELING FOR EACH. PARTICIPANT 2: THE MUSIC WAS PLAYING AT A VERY COMFORTABLE LEVEL. PARTICIPANT 1: FOR ME, I LIKED THE LINE. IT SHOWS THE DIFFERENT SOUNDS. I LIKED THAT. THE DOTS, A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING FOR ME. SO THAT WOULD BE MY FEEDBACK. PARTICIPANT 4: WHEN YOU HAVE THE ONES WITH THE FAN AND THE CIRCLES, THE CIRCLES DISTRACT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? DAVID: SO YOU'RE TRYING TO INTERPRET WHAT INSTRUMENT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WITH THE CIRCLES, IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN? CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE?

264

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

PARTICIPANT 4: I'M NOT TRYING TO INTERPRET THE INSTRUMENT, WHAT INSTRUMENT, WHATEVER IT IS. I'M JUST LOOKING YOU SAID IT'S SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT MUSIC. HOW DO I FEEL, RIGHT? BUT THE CIRCLES JUST KEEP PULSING. THE FAN, I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE CHANGING COLOUR, AND I NOTICE A BIT. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PULSING CIRCLES, I JUST FIND MYSELF FOCUSSED ON THE PULSING CIRCLES, YOU KNOW. YOU MAY NOTICE WITH DEAF, LIKE, IF TWO DEAF ARE TALKING, IF A PERSON, THEY SEE, THEY EASILY GET DISTRACTED. SO SAME WITH THE CIRCLE THING. DAVID: THAT'S INTERESTING. ANY OTHER COMMENTS? NO? SO THIS IS OUR PULSING SUN AGAIN, AND THEN AFTER THIS WE HAVE ONE MORE. DAVID: SO THE TONE IS SO LOW. THE LINE IS ACTUALLY THERE. PARTICIPANT 1: I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. DAVID: THE LINE IS ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE, BUT IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH MUSIC IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE. WE CAN BARELY SEE IT ON THIS SCREEN TOO. DAVID: IT WAS THERE. AND THEN THIS IS THE LAST ONE. WE WILL BRING UP THE LAST ONE NOW. SO BEFORE WE GET TOO FAR, I WILL JUST MENTION -PARITICIPANT 1: DO WE NEED TO FILL OUT FOR THAT ONE? DAVID: NO. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. IT WAS BLANK. EVEN I COULDN'T SEE IT, AND I WAS STANDING NEXT TO IT. I WILL JUST COMMENT THAT WHEN WE ARE DONE, IF YOU COULD PULL OUT THIS QUESTIONNAIRE, WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO FILL IT OUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE. SO THIS WILL BE THE LAST QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER THIS SONG. AND THEN ALSO, LIDA WILL BE COMING AROUND SOON AND SHE WILL PRESENT YOU WITH THIS WONDERFUL POSTER. YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE CONCERT. WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE RUNNING THE CONCERT. SO THIS IS A CONCERT WITH EMOTI-CHAIRS. YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT VIBRATIONS AND STUFF. WELL THIS CONCERT IS YOU SIT IN A CHAIR AND FEEL THE VIBRATIONS THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY WHILE THE MUSIC PLAYING. UNKNOWN: (CAN'T HEAR QUESTION) DAVID: I BELIEVE IT'S 5. PARTICIAPANT 2: I SAW IT ON TV. DAVID: YEAH, YOU SAW IT ON TV.

265

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

PARTICIPANT 4: I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT. I THINK IT'S GOOD, BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NO GOOD IF THERE'S NO LYRICS. DAVID: OH, BUT THERE WILL BE LYRICS BECAUSE GEMME OR ONE OF HER FRIENDS WILL BE THERE TO CAPTION THE LYRICS. WE WILL CAPTION THE LYRICS. WE WILL DO A LITTLE BIT OF VISUALIZATION, AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE THE CHAIRS. SO LIDA WILL HAND THESE OUT IN A MOMENT. AND THE LAST THING LIDA WILL BE HANDING OUT TO YOU IS AN ENVELOPE THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS. PARTICIPANT 1: I SAW THAT ON THE NEWS LAST WEEK. IT'S RELATED TO THE CHAIRS, RIGHT? DAVID: YEAH, WE'RE THE SAME BUNCH. AND FINALLY WHAT LIDA WILL BE HANDING OUT IS THIS WONDERFUL ENVELOPE HERE. AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IS SIGN AND DATE IT, AND THEN TEAR THIS AWAY AND GIVE IT BACK TO LIDA. AND IF YOU OPEN THE WONDERFUL ENVELOPE, WHAT YOU WILL FIND INSIDE -- OOOH, GOODY! $30. SO LAST SONG. HIT IT DOUG. (BLOCK 4, SONG 7) DAVID: WAS THAT BETTER TO SEE? PARTICIPANT 1: I NOW SORT OF AGREE WITH HER ABOUT THE BLACK BACKGROUND. IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS BETTER THAN THE WHITE. DAVID: I WAS WONDERING IF WE SHOULD FLIP THEM AS WE WERE GOING. PARTICIPANT 1: YEAH MAYBE, THAT WOULD BE GOOD. IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE BOTH. IT'S GOOD FOR THE COLOUR. THE BLACK SEEMS TO BE BETTER. IT SEEMS TO BRING OUT THE COLOURS. DAVID: THE REST, JUST LEAVE IT THERE, AND WE WILL COLLECT THE EXTRAS WHEN WE ARE DONE THE DAY. PARTICIPANT 7: WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT. IN TERMS OF MUSIC AND THE EMOTIONS FOR THESE VISUALIZATIONS, THERE HAS TO BE A SORT OF HUMAN CONNECT. LIKE SAY FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE SOME DANCING OR TACTILE CONNECTION. TECHNICALLY THOSE THINGS CAN REPRESENT EMOTION, BUT IT'S DIFFICULT. BUT IF YOU SEE A PERSON SIGNING ASL IT CAN BE POETIC OR DANCING, THEN YOU CAN SEE THE CONNECTION. BUT THIS IS HARD TO SEE. PARTICIPANT 1: OR EVEN SIMPLY HAVING THE VIBRATIONS. I THINK YOU WERE WRITING AT THE TIME, BUT I WAS TELLING HIM THE BLACK BACKGROUND IS NICER. IT'S JUST MORE VISUALLY APPEALING. SO YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE BLACK.

266

APPENDIX B. FOCUS GROUP I

DAVID: IF THERE'S MORE COMMENTS, THANK YOU. THAT'S FINE, WE WELCOME YOUR COMMENTS. BUT, YOU KNOW, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

PARTICIPANT 1: JUST THINKING, THIS LAST ONE IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WRITE BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER ALL OF THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE THIRD ONE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. IF THERE WAS SOME SOUND MAYBE I WOULD HAVE AN EASIER TIME REMEMBERING. (DAVID TALKING TO PARTICIPANT 1) DAVID: ANY LAST COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS? WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO GIVE A LAST COMMENT OR QUESTION? NO. OTHERWISE, THANK YOU FOR COMING. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY. TRANSLATOR SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF PARTICIPANT 10: IT WAS VERY REPITITIOUS. SHE SAW THE SAME THING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. PARTICIPANT 10: IT WAS VERY REPITITIOUS, ESPICIALLY THE FANS.

What Was Most Enjoyable? Feeling positive of the visualized beats colors and instrument with melody colors looking at the changing colors the fact that this is being experimental or will eventually some of them are good lots of color nothing really - need to connect music to the human experience (dancing, hands, etc) same as #2 interesting concept - had never thought about presenting music in this way before

What Was Least Enjoyable? Not enough time to "digest" and write what we saw lots of fans no accompanying sounds/vibrations the fans were boring and the flashing orange rectangle was rather annoying. I feel that music was not really conveyed well, perhaps vibrations would help no music! dull color repetition and discomfort with opposing designs (hurts my eyes) the orange flashing (oval) couldn't really connect with any of the formats that were presented

Consent to Participate in Study from Subject Information Form
The purpose of this study is to evaluate different ways of presenting music visually. To do this, we will ask you to watch twelve (12) different examples of visualizations and provide us with your opinion about them. Each example runs less than one minute. You are also asked to complete two additional surveys, one prior to the study and one at the conclusion of the study.

Confidentiality All raw data will be kept strictly confidential. A summary of the data will be published in academic venues but no individual details will be identified in this summary. The information gathered from surveys will be strictly used for research and academic purposes with only the principal investigator and his supervisor having access to it

Risks and Discomforts The risks associated with participating in this study are minimal. You may experience some fatigue with watching the visualizations. However, you are able to take breaks at any time or even stop participation in the study without penalty. You may also experience some discomfort with being video or audio recorded. In this case, you may choose not to participate in the study or record your opinions in writing and remain off camera.

Expected Benefits Individual participants will not receive any direct benefits; however, this study will benefit the general community of deaf or hard of hearing users. This study will test different styles of music visualization that will assist in developing new practises for music visualization. We hope that this information may lead to improvements in music visualization technologies and techniques. Voluntary Nature of Participation: Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If you do not wish to participate in this study it will not affect current or future relations with Ryerson University or The Centre for Learning Technologies.

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: First of all I apologize for the late start. I was hoping to get started about 10 minutes sooner, but whatever. The technology broke down, and these things happen. So just to start, My name is David. And I am a PhD candidate here at Ryerson. I am studying Mechanical Engineering, and my area is how to make certain kinds of information more available to deaf and hard of hearing people. I am hard of hearing myself, and I am a signer, but I'm going to rely on Tala tonight to make sure that, you know, my brain and my signing doesn't get confused. I appreciate that. Tonight we also have Tanya who will be providing captioning services for those of us who don't sign. Those of us who do may also follow on the screen Â­ whatever. Let me just quickly introduce the team so you know [who] we all are. In the green shirt we have Mike. Say hi.

Mike: Hi.

David: Over here with the camera and the camera we have Jorge.

Jorge: Hey.

David: In the dark blue shirt we have Quoc. Today what will happen is Mike will be running the technology, Jorge will be running the camera, and Quoc will be picking up all the paper. This will be complex. David: So, I handed out to you this nice package. What I will just do is if you take the paperclip off, and take the forms out, you will see inside the envelope a few pieces of paper. Some of you already got your consent forms. If you didn't bring one, we have one here for you to sign. The information form is for you to take home. If you have not already done so, we would appreciate if you sign the consent form. I will quickly explain what we are asking you to do. So just let me briefly explain what we are going to be doing today, what we are going to do

300

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

today is run some music in the room, and we're going to put visualization on the screen over there next to Jorge. We will ask you to watch these visualizations and give us feedback. And just to let you know, your participation here today is completely voluntary. You can choose to leave at any time. Upon request we can remove you from the videotape and remove your information from the data centre. If you don't want to be videotaped, please tell us now too so Jorge can adjust the camera.

Participant 5: What is the purpose of the filming? What will it be used for just so I know and I can decide if I should be filmed or not.

David: Excellent question. Thank you very much for asking. The point of the video is primarily for me to have a record on top of the transcripts of what was done today so that if I'm not entirely clear what the transcript is telling me I can look at the signed version of your comment and get a sense of what you actually said compared to what Tala says you said. That's the primary purpose. The video cassette will be protected in a locked cabinet, no one else will have access to it except me and the three other gentlemen in this room. It will only be used for research purposes. Participant 5: Sure. David: So, please feel free to sign the consent forms and Quoc will come around and pick them up. Then I will explain the rest. (Quoc is collecting the forms) David: The next thing I will ask you to do is you'll find in the envelope a Pre-Study Questionnaire. This is just a quick questionnaire to give me a little bit of information about you. Fill out what you feel comfortable.

301

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: So this is the next step. This is a pre study questionnaire. I will ask each of you to fill out the pre study questionnaire. This information will only help me get a sense of who you are. Participant 3: (cannot hear question) David: I am signing it later. That is go on file for myself. Participant 2: What do we do with this after? David: You fill it out. Quoc will be coming around to pick up the pre study questionnaire. Participant 4: (cannot hear question) David: Did you fill it out? Participant 4: (shakes head) David: If you could fill it out now that would be... Participant 1: (cannot hear question) David: The question is primarily designed to ask what your general experience was. If you want to... Participant 1: (cannot hear question) David: ...you have lots of options Participant 1: (cannot hear question) David: That is true. I have learned overtime there are a lot of schools that provide a music curriculum and there are a lot of school of the deaf that don't. It's an odd attitude. Deaf people have rhythm. They have a sense of rhythm. Participant 1: (cannot hear question) David: Exactly. David: I'm just waiting for one more.

302

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: Okay, so this form here [showing] I want you to hold on to it. You will fill this out at the end. Let me explain this before we get started. What we are going to do is I am just going to give a quick example of what we are going to be doing in the study. What we are going to do is Mike will start up a nice piece of music [music playing]. In case you don't know, that's "Happy Birthday". Okay kill it Mike. Thank you Mike. The idea is you would see some nice visualization like you just saw. It won't look like that, that's just a throw away we wanted to show you. And what you're going to do is you're going to take out one of these sheets [showing].

Participant 5: I was wondering is it possible that we...We have predominantly deaf participants on this side, so can we flip the screens? So that the captions are on the far side and the music visualization is on this screen? I don't know if that is possible. David: Nope, you're already set up right? Tanya (Captionist): Yup, I would have to move this whole thing. Can we can move the people, not the projector? David: We can move the people, not the projector. Participant 5: That's okay, it would just be better to have good sightlines when you have a deaf audience. If the deaf participant knows where the video will be, then we will adjust it accordingly. David: I wanted it to be originally on this screen, but we had difficulty getting the computer to talk to the right screen. We're lucky it's talking to one of them and not both. But I appreciate your comment. So let me go back to my example. The visualization you just watched Â­ then you will fill out this (shows form). The first question asks whether or not you enjoyed it. And I asking you to circle your preference. Then you are asked what did the visualization mean, and what did you get out of it, if anything? Then I have these three nice lines of cartoon characters here; what I am going to ask you to do is I am going to ask you to mark off one on

303

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

each line to tell me in your opinion whether the music was happy, calm, excited, over-bearing or what subtle? How you feel? What did the music get across? Then finally I want you to rate the emotion as happy, sad, angry, cheerful, etc. That's essentially what this is. So what we are going to do is, at the end of each visualization, you will all get about 2 minutes to fill this out. Once we collect them all, then we'll go on to the next visualization. We will do this for all 12. If any of you at any time need a break, just ask and we will take a quick break. Okay, all set? This is the fun part, really. [Visualization #1: Day Tripper] David: Okay? So please fill out the form. Participant 4: I want that for my Windows Media Player [laughs]. Participant 1: Circle? David: You can circle, or mark with an X. You can put it in pencil if your pen is not working. Participant 1: Do we have to answer everything? David: It's all voluntary; you can answer as much or as little as you like. Participant 1: But what's all this for? David: I want to get a sense of what you thought was expressed in the music. Participant 3: (signs) David: There is one form for each visualization, that's correct. David: So, how does that feel so far? Is that working? Do you have any questions with regard to the forms? Participant 4: I kind of like it. It made me feel upbeat, good.

Participant 3: It was neat. Very cool.

304

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

Participant 5: The form is good, but where it says "weak and strong" perhaps one suggestion is to have the happy, sad, and the fear, perhaps all of them have pictures. In the middle it is not quite clear what does that mean, is its neutral form? Is that an extremity? Maybe from weak to strong. Each number with a matching picture. David: What worked with this visualization? Participant 2: When you listen to the music, and you get a different feel from the music when you watch it versus just listening it. David: Are you hearing? Participant 2: I am hearing. David: So you're hearing it at the same time? Participant 2: Yeah. Participant 2: Am I supposed to be thinking about what the music tells me or what the visualization tells me? Do I look just at the visualization or do you want me to listen?

David: The whole experience.

Participant 5: I know what you mean. For example if you are sitting in the motor chair and you actually feel the vibration and listen to the music, it's tough to know what to focus on, the music or the chair. Participant 2: Maybe when you do this again if you have music separately from the visualizations and see if they give the same feelings. There are those who are totally deaf and they will get more from the visualizations, and the others who have some hearing would get more from the music. Compare to see if you get the same feedback.

305

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

Participant 5: Maybe it was the interpretation, or the captioning. It's not that it's tough to focus on, I mean more so if you're sitting in the motor chair and you have the music on, you can make the connection between the sound and the sight and the feelings. Participant 4: Just adding to what she said, I'm thinking maybe next time you try the musical chairs with the visualization and or using headphones. Even though some deaf can't hear, with the headphones when you up the bass you can feel the vibrations. Somehow they can feel connected to what's happening there. I think that might give you a better, clearer answer than right now. David: Mike, are we set for the next visualization? Well Mike, hit it; let's see what we get this time around. [Visualization #2] David: Okay? David: So what were you thinking about this. Was there something that worked here or didn't work here? Participant 1: For me, I couldn't hear anything but solely relying on the visualization it was great. It's similar to a video game. It was nice and kind of neat. Participant 6: I can hear the music, but I liked when you reached the end of the piece there was a disconnect between what I could hear and what I could see. David: Each piece is about 20-30 seconds long; so we're intentionally cutting it off at a certain point. I agree, you will get a disconnect. Participant 2: I found that this one was more kind of came at me... I really liked it. David: Well Mike, are you ready to go again?

Mike: Yes I am. Participant 3: Should we be putting down the number for what was what?

306

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: We'll handle that. I just want you to worry about what you're seeing and what it is. [Visualization #3] Mike: Sorry. Participant 1: Don't worry about it. Just take your time. Participant 3: Is it broken? David: Oh, no it's not broken. (Visualization starts again) David: Okay, so what did you think of that? It's a little different. Participant 5: I didn't feel any sort of connection at all with that piece. Participant 4: I don't know why but when I was watching the visualization I was thinking back in my mind to "Ode to Joy" Â­ I was thinking in the back of my mind with the way they moved and pulsated and then broke off into smaller pieces moving around. That just popped up. David: Interesting. Okay, so we'll hit the next one. Is everyone ready? [Visualization #4] David: Any comments? Participant 1: Looking at it, it just looks like light. It doesn't feel like there's a connection to sound or music. Just things floating around on the screen. Maybe it does connect, but I cannot imagine what kind of music it is after seeing something like that. I don't hear anything though, so I guess that's just me.

Participant 5: I felt that one was a bit better. Not bad. Better than the first one, the one with the spots. I thought this one was a little bit better.

307

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: Okay, so we'll move right along. [Visualization #5] David: Any thoughts before we move on? Participant 1, 3 and 5: I think we should just move on. David: Okay, the next one. [Visualization #6: Beautiful People] David: Any thoughts? Participant 2: I think the music Â­ there needs to be more connection between the music and the type of visualization. Circles and a black background make me think of night and that the music should be calm, and it's not calm. David: Interesting. Participant 3: Just in terms of the... you think of the moving spots as perhaps having a story, something negative and interesting. When they collide perhaps it's supposed to show turmoil. Perhaps there could be some kind of theatre to it, some kind of drama, in my opinion. Participant 6: The background is very confusing. I think it leads to preconceived notions about what the music is supposed to be. If it's something unrelated it's confusing. Participant 1: Lucky for me I can't hear anything. I focus on the visuals so I hear nothing. For me it's more like if you're driving at night and it's raining Â­ it's the fluttering lights of the other drivers and that hazy look. It reminds me of driving at night and other people's headlights.

Quoc: Before we continue does anyone need a short break?

308

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: You're alright? Remember if at any time you need a break, tell us and we'll take a break. Quoc: We're just halfway through. David: Thank you Quoc. [Visualization #7] Participant 5: (Signing) David: Yeah, I know. And the challenging thing for me is when I am dealing with music is trying to figure how, you know, how would English speaking hearing people talk about this stuff? What do they mean when they talk about loud or soft? What do they mean when they talk about...? Participant 4: Watching it, that reminded me of the Walt Disney movie Fantasia Â­ the part called "The Sorcerer's Apprentice." In that part, if I remember correctly, I remember reading that Walt Disney made that movie to somehow show pictures of how music affects people. It shows how music touches them, and moves them. Are you trying to do something similar? David: Not quite. Participant 4: Not quite. David: The interpretation is entirely yours. The software is only taking the information of the music file and then presenting it according to the logic of the software. The interpretation is all yours, not the software's. David: Any other comments? Okay, Mike? [Visualization #8] David: Okay? So there are 4 more songs left.

Participant 4: We should just keep going.

309

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: Yep, we're going to just keep going. David: Okay? So we'll do the next one. [Visualization #9] David: Okay. David: Everyone ready? Okay, we'll start the next one. [Visualization #10] Participant 5: Maybe next time, say it's for 2 hours, so in case you lose time. David: Normally we do, but the person that did the booking said we started at 6, but we said to come at 6. But also we were having technology problems that started us off really late, as well. This is going to be the last one. Participant 5: I thought we had two more. David: We can go for two more, if you want to go for two more. This is the eleventh. [Visualization #11] David: Okay. David: Okay, so what we're going to do now is play the very last visualization. After you fill out this form [for the visualization], I am going to get you to fill out this one. I will quickly explain what it asks. It's going to ask you first what did you like, what did you enjoy the most? Which of these visualizations gave you the best sense of what was going on with the music? What aspect of the music did it give you the best sense of Â­ drums, instruments, and melodies? We have screen shots of the different visuals to help you out. Also we will ask you out what was the most enjoyable and least enjoyable aspect of this. Feel free to use the back of the page. Then we will have a wrap up discussion for any other comments. [Visualization #12]

310

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

David: So what do you folks think? What do you think this last visualization, or the visualizations as a whole? Participant 4: I enjoyed the stars much more. They give me an interpretation of the music, I'm not sure if that's the right word. I thought the radar was good, but I noticed I appreciated the stars more, and how they showed music to me. I feel positive about it. Participant 1: I agree. It's the same experience for me. The stars are visually beautiful. I found myself mesmerized and it's really neat. Participant 3: The starscape made me feel nauseous. There was too much movement and it was overwhelming. It made me feel sick. Participant 5: Positive thing for me, before there was a white background and now a black background. It's easier on the eyes with the black. The white it was really difficult; I couldn't stare at the screen, but the black was better. I'm impressed. Participant 2: There would need to be a lot of human interpretation as well, if you can't interpret it with the ears, it's going to be hard for someone to pick up on the tones and melodies of the music. The moving circles helped me see the rhythm better than the starscape, although the starscape told a better story. You'd have to pick which one went better with a different sound. If you left it up to the computer it wouldn't tell a story. Participant 5: Just to clarify your comment, what do you mean in terms of interpreting the sound? Participant 2: Because I can hear and see it, I found that hearing the music gives me a different feeling than what I'm seeing. There needs to be more connection between hearing and seeing. Different types of pictures showed the sound better than others. The hearing interpretation made it easier to pick out which one did a better job of representing what you're hearing. I would use the circle one that shows the rhythm. If you're going to a concert and want to see what gives a better interpretation of what is going on in terms of drums and instruments. The

311

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

other one didn't do that as well. It's complicated and I can't really explain it as well. Participant 4: I hope you continue with this study. What I would like to see next time is that we use the chairs. I've heard stories about them. I would like to hear what the chairs do for the experience. Or next thing is, when I listen to music I have headphones, and to understand the song I have to read the lyrics. But, even if there were no lyrics I know the lyrics have an effect if I don't know the words. I want to match the chairs with the visualization to see if it's different. David: None of the music had lyrics. Most of it was standard, popular music. The last piece was the jazz piece "At Last". Two of the pieces are from video games Â­ one from Doom and one from Final Fantasy. Participant 4: Still, even with the music itself, I'd like to see how my reaction would be for the music plus the visualization at the same time. I'm sure it would be totally different from how I feel now. Participant 5; It's the same idea in terms of levels, someone with a cochlear implant, hearing, hard of hearing, deaf, or profoundly deaf person Â­ it depends on the level of hearing loss. We would link it to our ability or inability to hear. You would have a better image of what's going on. As a deaf person you don't have that, you can't hear it so it's a different experience. David: I'm deaf on one half of my head and moderate on the other. There are different interpretations and experiences. When I'm wearing a headset Â­ Participant 3: I need to go out. Puppy needs a bathroom break. David: I will quickly explain the last thing you have to do. This thing [showing] is an envelope with money. I want you to sign it and date it. Tear the slip off the envelope and give it to Quoc. David: Any last comments before our interpreter disappears?

312

APPENDIX C. FOCUS GROUP II

Participant 4: I just hope next time you have the chairs. As she said, I can't hear the words but if we had the chairs plus the visualization - wow it boggles my mind just at the thought of it. David: Tonight the movie Cast Away is being shown at Dundas Square starting at 8:45. XXXXXX promises this time we will be using the chairs Â­ as long as the weather holds up and stays dry, he'll use the chairs. You're more than welcome to come watch the movie and sit in one of the chairs. Participant 4: When's the movie? David: It's at 8:45 pm tonight. Participant 4: Just in time to go get a snack and then see the chairs. Do I have to book the chairs? David: There will be a free-flow chair that people can switch in and out of. It depends on how many show up, but there will be others you can sit in for the whole 2 hour movie. So there's going to be lots of sharing. It will be weather dependent. They can't have the electronics in the rain, so if it rains we can't be there. Participant 4: That would be a shocking experience. [laughs] [End of Focus Group Meeting]

Subject Number 29 Starscape

Most Enjoyed

Sense of Music Starscape

What Was Most Enjoyable? looking at moving colors and shapes I'm at lost for words but overall I felt stimulated (hey, not that). The starscape gave me a more (+) feel it reminds me of what I see on windows media player but this experience made me think about it from the perspective of someone without hearing aids. That was cool. colors ->radar. Boops/dots moves along lines ->moving circles more visually with colors and backgrounds. Need more variety to show making the connection between what I was seeing and what I was hearing. a new way of "feeling" the music

What Was Least Enjoyable? not hearing the sound

31

1. Starscape, 2. Radar

Starscape

the boring circles

32

Preferred Moving Circles style, but I feel that the other two can be good when used appropriately

they each did that in their own way: circles = rhythm, starscape reminded me of a ballet radar makes me think of searching / longing Radar felt best; Moving Circles is close runner up Radar then Starscape Moving Circles style, although Radar also does a good job of this

I think it was a little confusing for me

315
33 35 36

Radar

excess movement in starscape moving circles sometimes seems very disjointed and disconnected. Might be helpful if there was a legend i.e. certain colors = certain sound instruments

Radar Prefer the Moving Circles style. Seems to me that it repeated the most logical connection between what I am hearing and what I should be seeing

V7 Music Enjoyment Enjoyable Enjoyable Enjoyable Somewhat enjoyable

V7 Meaning going into space, looking at universe reminds me of Walt Disney's "Fantasia" movie LOVE it. I think it did a good job of telling the "story" Somewhat lost traveller of space, admiring new places but sometimes gets bumped around. Still feels a little confused in surroundings Booming sounds with different volumes going up and down, almost like rhythms I liked this one - I wonder if it would work in a slower, more calm piece though

V8 Music Enjoyment Enjoyable Neutral Enjoyable

V8 Meaning A parade of nice and beautiful dancing lights It gave a really good visualization of the rhythm! Happy-go-lucky falls into trouble, almost burst free but sucked right back then faces series of fearful situations. Is sick of it, frustrated by end Sound rhythms like boom-boom (like drum) then bang. Not a big bang - sounds almost the same level but the pink part on the top seems distraction for me I prefer this format. I like that the format helps you anticipate in the piece, re: what's coming next as well as showing a discernible history of what's already happened

It just does not sound good. I cannot make sense of a song. Old songs are not always recognizable[.] I wondered if I was missing some clarity of individual instruments but am now second guessing myself when I heard David Shipp mention a 4 note difference.

I listen to old songs I once knew and wish I had that back again. Am getting Clear Voice with Advanced Bionics in the Fall (I think) and am wondering if this will help at all.

I can still get the beat so try to be happy with that. I have been to a few concerts to make the best of my situation. I can hear the music now with my CI - I just cannot make any sense out of it.

Hearing music via my hearing aids is the most enjoyable. Listening through my FM system or silhouette isn't the same, but I use them to respect other people's wish for peace and quiet.

It'd be great if there was an app for iPhones and it would automatically upload lyrics that are being played in the concert or on the radio. [arrow indicating same as previous response]

As long as I know the words usually ok. If not then do not enjoy. often the sound of the music is not as I feel it should be - using earphones- & adjusting balance

On my computer, I have heard, using cd's/videos of choirs that are wonderful, Mormon Tabernacle choir- and Jacqui Lawson on musical cards that can be emailed [np] I am not good with electronic equipment, but get help from my grown (early 20's) grandchildren.

315 Nothing's changed. I can't make out the melody. Trying different hearing aid settings. 316 317 Many songs I remember the music but not the words. Captioning helps me enjoy it. For new music, I need the words to enjoy it or figure out if I like it at all. - many videos/cds of musicians from my generation 50's 60's 70's have CD's/video uncaptioned.

I've been involved in music my whole life, playing the piano, singing in a choir, singing solos for weddings / funerals, and now I can't do any of it T.V. music shows captioned but only show new songs. Rarely do they show standards.

hearing words during a concert Even with my hearing aids, music is distorted and I do not hear the bass notes well. It sounds as tho there are two different[sic] sep tunes playing very often. The lyrics are not clear and I have always really "tuned into" the lyrics of music. As my hearing loss is the common type - that the lower tones have gone and the very high "notes" remain- hearing aids amplify but distort and do not completely capture the lower tones. I hear music well when is is live, in small venues with good acoustics - it is such a treat but rarely accessible where we live. The choir on opening night of this concert was so enjoyable. Occasionally when one of the kitchen cupboards closes - it sounds like a drum beat in a Caribbean band Â­ I love it! I also drum with a small native[?] drum - sometimes in a small group.

For the most part, I can hear the beat and rhythm of the music. The problem for me is understanding and hearing the lyrics of the song. For this I look up the lyrics online and remember them for future listening. By adjusting the volume, bass and equalizer, I can listen better, but the main problem with that is I usually have to adjust it for every song, since one may be softer and the next very loud.

Like mentioned above, hearing and understanding lyrics and having to constantly change the equalizer. Although there is nothing more that can be changed about the lyrics, it would be nice if there was a system that automatically adjusted the settings to fit the song.

Music, both instrumental / classical and lyrical is wonderful.as long as I can hear, I will always appreciate music.

326

Wearing my CI, it's either the beat / music or words, but never the clarification of both being blended together. I heard better when used to wear a hearing aid.

I missed going to concerts where as no closed or real-time captioning is being used. Not all concerts are set up for those with FM systems.

No positive experience with the exception of the Rita McNeil concert last night. First time to actually "follow" Lyrics. I really don't enjoy listening to music unless I am by myself without any background interference Continued on next page

1) I never hear / understand the words of the lyrics like last night at Rita McNeil's concert I hear the music (loudly) but seldom the words 2) if I listen to music I cannot focus on my surroundings[-] don't hear telephone ring, front door knock, Husband calling or (in the past) my babies crying [np] I prefer to be connected to the world rather than to music Music is mostly background noise

dancing to music would be great

329

I'm using what I have at my disposition[-] would love to have better equipment but then if I buy something will I hear better? I'm not convinced.

For some strange reason I seem to be more frustrated to access music at home rather than my vehicle. At home even if it is loud I can hear but can't understand. In the car it will depend at what station I'm listening too. Soft music is normally what I will seek.

If the music is instrumental I will be able to hear. If their is words such as OPERA (no way) I'm able however to detect beat as we have now started taking ballroom dancing and I have no problem hearing the beat as long as the acoustic is good. I used to sing in a choir had to stop! this was one of my major disappointed. I lost my hearing overnight 6 yrs ago

Subject Number 331

Solutions Satisfaction

Music Frustrations

Music Positive Experiences

Music has a distorted sound and with a CI. It is hard to discriminate vocals/lyrics. For me, I enjoy 'understanding' what music means to the artist and why it was composed.

- Too garbled! I like classical music because its 'softer' (and country too!) I don't like Rock music because it sounds like drums beating that make no sense. As above

I have been able to find music where lyrics are available - this REALLY helps!

332

I do not or can not pick up the lyrics or what the singer is singing.

I used to be a good singer but I am unable to carry a tune (whether it is age or my deafness I don't know)

333 335 336 I usually listen to books on tapes I feel [comment incomplete] all my life I have been HOH. I have always listened to music but never for the most part understood words made out through music. I just listen to beats etc attending live concerts, performances 337 That the volume might be [remainder of comment illegible] not understanding words or knowing the name of song or who is singing even though like the songs I really enjoy my CD's and the concerts I go to. listen to music does give relaxation even though I don't understand the words

TED ROGERS SCHOOL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT

Are you looking for better, more enjoyable ways to listen to music?
Research Participants Wanted
I am a hard of hearing student at Ryerson University pursuing a Ph.D. degree. I am studying ways to use technology to express music visually to support music listening by Deaf, Deafened, and Hard of Hearing people. I am exploring new ways to access music and I am seeking help and input from the community. My aim is to gather people's opinions and thoughts on this issue to assist in the completion of my studies. I would like to talk with people at the Conference about their experiences with listening to music in hopes of learning what they feel is missing and what works. Lastly, I am interested in people's ideas on how to use technology and music visualization to improve their music experience.

Your feedback is invaluable!
If you would like to participate, I will be available at the Conference for one-on-one interviews. During the interview, I will ask you about your music experience and I will show you at least three short video examples of existing ways to visualize music that use changing colors and shapes to describe music. After each example I will ask for your feedback. Each interview will take approximately 30 minutes of your time to complete. If you are able to participate in an interview, your participation is entirely voluntary and you may stop the interview at any time.

If you are over 18, are Deaf, Deafened, Hard of Hearing, or use a CI and are interested in participating, contact me any time during the conference.

Consent to Participate in Study from Subject Information Form
The purpose of this study is to evaluate different ways of presenting music visually. To do this, we will ask you to watch at least three (3) different examples of visualizations and provide us with your opinion about them. Each example runs about one minute. You are also asked to complete two additional surveys, one prior to the study and one at the conclusion of the study to gather your opinion about music and music visualization. Confidentiality All raw data will be kept strictly confidential. A summary of the data will be published in academic venues but no individual details will be identified in this summary. The information gathered from surveys will be strictly used for research and academic purposes with only the principal investigator and his supervisor having access to it Risks and Discomforts The risks associated with participating in this study are minimal. You may experience some fatigue with watching the visualizations. However, you are able to take breaks at any time or even stop participation in the study without penalty. You may also experience some discomfort with being video or audio recorded. In this case, you may choose not to participate in the study or record your opinions in writing and remain off camera. Expected Benefits Individual participants will not receive any direct benefits; however, this study will benefit the general community of deaf or hard of hearing users. This study will test different styles of music visualization that will assist in developing new practises for music visualization. We hope that this information may lead to improvements in music visualization technologies and techniques. Voluntary Nature of Participation: Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If you do not wish to participate in this study it will not affect current or future relations with Ryerson University or The Centre for Learning Technologies. If you choose to participate, you have the ability to leave the study at any time and for any reason without penalty. In addition, you may refuse to answer any questions or participate in any task at any point of the study without penalty. Questions about the Study: If you have any questions or concerns, about this study please feel free to contact Deborah Fels at dfels@ryerson.ca.

And,  do  you  think  your  hearing  is  more  steady  now  or  is  it  still  changing?   It's  still  changing.       Downward  or  all  over?   Down.       Yeah?   Yeah,  I  can  tell  it's  getting  worse...gradually  overtime.       Oh,  OK.       Yes.       So,  the  reason  I  am  asking  this  is  because  I  want  to  get  a  sense  of  whether  you  noticed   changes  to  the  music  recordings  that  you  listened  to  over  your  teenage  years.  So  when   you  were,  seven,  for  example,  you  don't  remember  very  much  is  what  you  are  saying,   right?   Not  too  much.    I  do  remember  it  was  much  easier  to  listen  though.             Right.       And  when  you  got  older,  when  you  were  in  grade  7,  8,  do  you  remember  listening  to   like  radio  and  playing  music  and  stuff  like  that?   I  remember  listening  to  music,  but  I  had  to,  I  had  to  listen  to  it  a  constant  amount  of   times  to  actually  understand  what  the  words  were  saying.         Wow,  ok.       And  has  that  changed  for  you  now,  when  you  listen  to  those  same  songs  is  it  harder   or...?   It's  mostly  the  same.    If  not  maybe  a  little  harder  with  some  of  the  words.    All  I  have   to  do  is  end  up  with  the  lyrics  with  the  songs  to  actually  understand  what  they  are   saying.       So  when  you  listen  to  music  then  what  do  you  find  is  missing,  just  the  lyrics  or  what   else  do  you  think  is  missing?       Mostly  the  lyrics  are  just  blurred  up.    Other  times  it's  maybe  the  beats  with  the   rhythm  or  you  know  not  catching  the  full  amount.    I  get  the,  the  higher  pitch  sounds,   not  so  much  lower  pitch  ones   Oh  ok.    OK,  well  that's  that  is  interesting

Do  you  think  that  the  way  you  hear  influences  the  stuff  you  choose  to  listen  to?   Quite  possibly  actually.       Do  you  think  it's  more  peer  pressure  or  do  you  think  it's  more  your  personal   preferences?   I  am  sorry?       Well,  do  you  listen  to  what  your  friends  tend  to  listen  to  or  do  you  find  that  you  have   your  own  preferences  more  because  of  what  you  yourself  can  hear  and  what  you  your   self  can  enjoy?   I  think  it's  a  bit  of  both  because  I  don't  explore  music  much  so  I  ask  my  friends  to...I   listen  to  some  of  their  music  and  sometimes  I  find  stuff  I  enjoy  listening  [to],  too,  so.       OK,  interesting.         So  you  were  talking  a  little  bit  earlier  about  um  about  lyrics  and  trying  to  understand   lyrics     Yup.         What  do  you  do  to  help  you  understand  lyrics?      Do  you  listen  more  closely?    Do  you   look  them  up  on  the  Internet?    What,  how  do  you  do  this?     I  try  to  listen  more  closely  the  first  few  times  and  try  to  work  out  what  I  think  they   are  saying,  and  at  some  point  I  just  look  them  up,  and  see  oh  ok  well  I  got  this  right   but  this  phrase  is  completely  wrong  because  I  am  doing  something  different,  so     Yeah,  I  think  that  is  a  familiar  experience.       What  other  strategies  do  you  find  that  you  use  when  you  are  listening  to  music?   Changing  the  volume  past  sometimes  for  certain  songs.    The  equalizer.    That's  pretty   much  all  I  use  when  I  am  listening  to  music.       When  you  shift  the  base,  when  you  shift  the  equalizer,  how  well  does  that  work  for   you?    Does  it  really  improve  it  or  is  it  touch  and  go?   It  improves  it  to  a  certain  degree.    It  makes  it  easier  to  pick  up  more  stuff.       Why  do  you  use  it?    Do  you  just  use  it  to  pick  up  more  stuff  or  do  you  use  it  to  shift  more   into  your  range?    Why  do  you  play  with  the  equalizer?       Maybe  so  I  can  hear  and  understand  music  better.   Do  you  wear  hearing  aids?

APPENDIX E. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

E.2. INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS

Yes.   Do  you  wear  hearing  aids  when  you  listen  to  music?   Well,  if  I  am  listening  to  my  iPod  then  I  have  to  take  them  out.    But  I  use  in-the-ear   headphones--so  those  are  buds  that  go  inside  your  ear--because  it's  supposed  to   sound  closer  to  your  ears.      But  when  I  am  just  listening  to  the  computer  without  my   headphones,  then  yes,  I  need  to  keep  my  hearing  aids  in  because  otherwise  I  will   catch  even  less.       Oh  OK.       So  do  you  find  that  the  hearing  aids  help  you  when  you're  listening  to  music  or...?   Yes   Do  you  believe  the  hearing  aids  distort  your  experience  of  music  or  improves  it  or...?   It  helps  me  but  probably...I  think  it  distorts  the  music  a  little  bit.  I  am  not  sure  how   but  it  sounds  different.       It  sounds  different  when  you're  wearing  hearing  aids  then  when  you're  not  wearing   hearing  aids?   Yes,  when  I  am  listening  to  my  headphones,  and  when  I  am  listening  to  my  hearing   aids,  there's  a  bit  of  difference.    I  am  not  sure  what  it  is  though.    But  there  is  a   difference  in  the  sound.       Yeah.    Sure.    OK.       When  you  listen  to  music--now  I  am  sure  Mom  is  a  bit  of  an  influence  in  this--what  do   you  do  when  you  listen  to  music?    Do  you  try  to  get  out  of  the  room?  Get  away  from   other  people?  What  do  you  do  when  you  want  to  listen  to  music?    Let  me  put  it  that   way.       If  I  want  to  listen  to  music  I  just...   I  know  it's  a  weird  question.    And  I  realize  that  because  you  live  at  home  with  your   parents  it  influences  the  listening  of  music  in  the  kitchen  or  living  room  opposed  to  the   bedroom  or  whatever  else.       Participant's  Mother:  I  am  not  particularly  bossy  about  music.    I  encourage  music   anywhere  and  everywhere.    I  think  music  should  always  be  heard  at  all  times.       Right.       Yes,  but  you  don't  like  some  of  my  music.  So  I  am  not  encouraged  about  that.

And  that  is  what  I  am  trying  to  get  at.       Participant's  Mother:  You'd  be  surprised  about  the  music  I  don't  like  though   (laughing).   You  don't  like  that  Japanese  song  (addressing  Mother)   Participant's  Mother:  I  am  not  crazy  about  the  Japanese.    She  likes  the  Japanese  style   music.       I  like  Japanese.    I  like  French  music.       Very  eclectic.    You're  not  the  Mariah  Carey,  Britney  Spears,  Boy  band  type.       I  don't  have  a  favorite  kind  of  music.    I  listen  to  anything  and  everything.       Do  you  go  to  concerts  at  all?   Not  often.   Not  often.   What  kinds  of  concerts  do  you  go  to?    You  live  in   XXXXXX  so  do  you  go  to  something   like  the  Air  Canada  Centre,  the  ACC,  or  do  you  go  to  something  smaller?   Well,  if  you  go  to  concerts,  then  that's  the  place  to  go.    The  most  concerts  I  have  ever   been  to  is  for  classical  music  but  that  is  because  I  have  taken  music  class.       Tell  me  a  little  bit  about  that.    You  take  music  class  within  school,  or  outside  of  school?   In  the  school.       When  you  take  music  at  school?    I  am  assuming  you're  talking  about  high  school.   Yup.       Is  that  Grade  9  music?    Grade  12  music?  Or  is  that  Band?  What  are  you  doing?   I  have  taken  it  for  the  past  three  years  and  it's  a  band.    There  is  the  grade  10  band   and  then  when  you  get  to  grade  11  and  12,  it's  a  combination  of  grade  11  and  12.     It's  just  a  band  on  its  own   What  instrument  did  you  play?   I  play  the  Alto  saxophone         Alto  sax.       Yes.    It's  quite  fun.

Yes,  my  little  brother  played  bass  clarinet.       What  strategies  did  you  use  to  work  in  the  band?  Because  obviously  as  Jennifer   Rowland  commented  on  earlier  this  morning,  she  has  to  get  feedback  from  her   colleagues  in  the  band,  compared  to  when  she  is  playing  alone.      So  what  did  you  do  to   I  guess  to  help  you  with  that?   I  talk  to  my  music  teacher  and  to  my  band  mates  about  if  I  miss  something  with   what  we're  playing.    I  just  get  their  help  with  any  issues  I  have.       In  high  school  did  you  use  an  interpreter,  FM?    How  did  you  support  yourself?   For  my  classes  I  used  an  FM  and  I  used  note  taking.    For  music,  I  did  not  use   anything  because  especially  in  class  it's  less  people,  so  it's  easier  to  just  listen  with   hearing  aids.           When  you  do  listen  to  music  at  home,  you  were  talking  about  using  your  computer;   you  were  talking  about  using  your  iPod.      Do  you  use  a  home  stereo  or  anything  like   that  or  just  a  computer  and  an  iPod?     Just  my  computer  and  iPod  mainly.       And  what  about  music  videos?    Do  you  watch  MTV  or  Much  or  anything  like  that?   Sometimes.   Does  that  help  you  or  not?   It  does.  I  can  put  closed  captioning  on  TV,  whenever  the  music  video  is  playing.     Some  of  them  have  closed  captioning,  some  of  them  don't,  but  the  ones  that  do,  it   really  helps  me  to  actually  see  words.    It  helps  me  enjoy  the  song.             When  you  are  watching  it  with  captioning,  do  you  prefer  the  synchronized  pop  up  on   captioning  that  goes  with  the  song?    Or  the  roll  up  style  captions?    What's  your   preference?    When  you  watch  captioned  music,  what  do  you  like  to  see?   Coordination  with  the  song.    If  they  just  write  the  last  lyric  that  is  already  gone,  it   kind  of  messes  you  up  with  the  beat.       So  you  were  talking  about  some  of  the  stuff  that  you  have  of  music.  That  your   frustration  can  be  around  lyrics.    What  do  you  think  would  help  improve  your   experience  of  music?    You  have  experienced  a  change  in  your  hearing  over  your   teenage  years,  right?    So  you  know  what  you  were  hearing  in  grade  9  and  you  know   what  you  are  hearing  now.    You  sort  of  have  a  memory  of  that,  right?   Yup.

So  what  do  you  think  would  help  you  have  a  better  experience  with  music?       That  is  a  hard  thing  to  explain  because  what  helps  me  better  appreciate  music  and   enjoy  music  more  is  by  adjusting  everything  and  obviously  I  can't  ask  the  bands  or   companies  to  just  to  do  that  just  for  me  because  all  hard  of  hearing  people  are  on   different  levels  and  so  it's  more  that  you  have  to  figure  it  out  for  your  personal  level.       If  you  wanted  to  have  a  computer  to  help  you  better  understand  music  you're  listening   to,  give  you  a  better  experience,  what  would  be  the  really  important  piece  of   information  that  you  would  want  the  computer  to  give  you?   Like  what?    The  song  title  or...?   If  the  computer  was  doing  something  automatic,  OK?  Just  really  you  just  wanted  to   play  a  particular  piece  and  it  were  to  help  you  better  enjoy  that  piece,  what  kind  of   things  would  you  want  the  computer  to  be  doing?       I  know,  it's  an  awkward  question  to  ask.   Obviously  the  title,  the  artist.    That's  already  a  given  for  computers  especially.       Right.       I  don't  know  lyrics,  I  suppose.       So  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  show  you  now  some  short  videos.    The  videos   are  based  on  work  that  is  going  on  at  Ryerson  and  as  well  as  other  places.    And  what  I   am  going  to  ask  you  to  do  as  you're  watching  each  of  these  videos  is  I  want  you  to  sort   of  to  keep  in  mind  how  you  would  interpret  what  it  is  you're  watching.    And  I  recognize   some  of  these  videos  might  be  more  confusing  or  whatever.      But  just  sort  of  try  and  get   a  sense  of  what  you  think  of  it.       OK.       So  as  I  said  earlier  I  am  not  going  to  play  sound.       OK.   (RADAR  STARTS)   (RADAR  ENDS)   So  what  did  that  video  say  to  you,  if  anything?       It  was  a  little  confusing  to  understand  because  there  was  no  volume  to  help  me  with   understanding  why,  for  example,  the  circles  in  the  middle  were...  I  forgot  the  word,   the  lines  that's  were  going  around  and  stuff

What  did  those  circles  then  mean  to  you?   After  a  while  it  kind  of  reminded  me  of  like  a  rock  band  kind  of  thing.      It  was  the   drums  or  the  percussion  system  of  it.      That's  the  only  idea  it  gave  me  because  it  kept   a  constant  beat.   And  those  lines  and  shades  that  were  moving  up  and  down?   I  am  still  trying  to  figure  out  what  that  was  supposed  to  be.    At  one  point  when  it   went  all  the  way  around,  I  figured  it  must  be  something  to  do  with  the  vocal  system.       OK.   It  was  interesting  to  look  at  it.       Was  there  anything  in  there  that  just  did  not  work  you?  You  were  like,  you  know...   It  was  just  at  the  beginning  when  you  just  see  the  lines  and  just  like...   Now  what.         What's  happening.   OK.   It  was  a  little  weird.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?       They  were  general.    Nothing  too  flashy.    That  is  just  my  preference.    It  wasn't  too   bright.    They  mostly  kept  constant.    It  was  fine.   Did  the  colours  mean  anything  to  you?       I  didn't  give  them  any  kind  of  thought   Did  you  want  the  colours  to  be  meaningful  to  you?    Did  you  want  the  colours  to  mean   something?   If  the  colours  could  maybe  represent  something  while  the  music  was  playing  then  it   might  help  me  understand  so  like  I  could  coordinate  the  red  with  louder  sound  or   something  that  just  tells  me...I  just  colour  coordinate  the  sounds  together.       What  did  you  think  of  the  speed  of  this  video?    Was  it  too  fast,  too  slow?    What  did  you   think  of  the  speed?   It  seemed  moderate.    I  don't  know  what  to  say.    I  wouldn't  say  it  was  slow  or  fast.

When  a  song  is  fast,  do  you  think  the  visualization  should  be  or  do  you  think  something   else  should  happen?   If  it  coordinates  with  a  song  even  a  fast  song,  I  think  it  should  keep  up  with  that.    I   don't  know.    I  don't  know  how  to  explain  it.       Nope,  I  fully  understand  that.       So  what  I  am  going  to  show  you  now  is  another  visualization.    Oddly  enough  it's  the   same  song.       (MOVING  CIRCLES  START)   (MOVING  CIRCLES  ENDS)   So  what  do  you  think?    What  do  you  think  of  that  one?       I  thought  that  was  more  understandable  than  the  other  one.   More  understandable  than  the  other  one?   Yeah   It  was  almost  like  reading  composition.    You  know  for  me  I  play  classical  music  so   you  have  the  sheet  music.      It  reminded  me  of  that  just  without  actually  seeing  the   notes  or  words  or  anything  but  you  could  understand  the  beat...you  could  tell  where   things  were.  That  was  pretty  cool.         As  were  watching  this  video  what  actually  worked  for  you  in  getting  the   understanding  of  music?   The  visuals  in  the  lines  definately  helped,  especially  when  it  hit  the  circles  it  put   emphasis  on  it.    So  even  if  you  can`t  hear  the  song  know  that  something...   Has  changed?   Yes   What  didn't  work  for  you?    What  do  you  find  confusing  about  this?   At  first  it  was  just  a  few  lines  and  all  these  more  lines  start  coming  in.      So  it's  like  I   think  I  know  what  this  is,  I  think  I  know  what  this  is,  but  what  is  this  supposed  to   be?    So  have  to  try  and  figured  it  out   Ah,  OK   But  other  than  that  I  thought  it  was  really  good.      I  could  follow  right  through  it  I   think.

Did  you  like  this  visualization  more  than  the  first  one?   This  one  made  a  little  more  sense  to  me  than  the  first  one  did   Did  it  look  more  like  music  or  less  like  music  than  the  first  one?   I  guess  since  I  play  classical  music  it  actually  made  more  sense  to  me     What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?   Good  actually.    It  didn't  have  the  black  back...   Background?   Yeah,  black  backdrop  and  each  one  was  a  different  colour  so  there  was  a  plain   constant  colour  and  they  weren't  too  bad  actually.       Did  colour  actually  mean  anything  to  you?   Yeah  it  did.    Again  it's  like  categorization.      You  can  tell  difference.  You  can  tell  that   there  are  different  sounds  happening  throughout  the  whole  song.       As  you  were  watching  it,  did  you  want  different  colours  to  mean  something  to  you?         Again  probably,  but  you  know,  the  way  it  works  it  doesn't  need  to  be  colourized.     You  can  just  follow  through  without  colour.       Did  you  find  this  visualization  too  fast?  too  slow?   No,  it  was  actually  pretty  good.    It  was  really  good.       Now  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  show  you  one  more  video.   Alright.   And  again  I  am  not  going  to  play  the  sound  and  again  it's  going  to  be  the  same  song.       (BARS  STARTS)   (BARS  ENDS)   So  what  did  you  think?   I  should  mention--because  it  will  probably  come  up  again--but  it  was  very  fast,  like   extremely  fast.    But  I  suppose  if  the  song  is  fast  that  would  make  sense.    But  it  was   just  like  up  and  down  so  fast  you  just  had  to  try  and  keep  up  with  it.       Yeah,  I  was  watching  your  eyes  follow  it.    Your  eyes  were  jumping.

Did  you  find  as  you  been  watching  each  of  these  videos,  did  you  find  any  one  of  these   videos  more  busy  than  the  others?   More...?   Like  more  visually  busy,  like  there  was  just  too  much  there.   I  think  the  last  one  had  too  much  there.    You  had  the  whole  screen.    You  had  all  of   them  to  watch  at  the  same  time.    And  they  were  going  really  fast.    So,  trying  to  keep   up  with  it.           Did  it  mean  anything  to  you?    Did  it  say  anything  to  you?    Was  it  meaningful  at  all?   The  music  was  very  fast  and  very  loud.    That's  what  it  told  me.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?     Good.    Every  time  it  kept  going  up,  it  reminded  me,  especially  with  all  them  being  at   different  levels,  it  reminded  me  of  the  wall  of  fire  kept  going  up.    So  it  was  kind  of   cool.     Did  you  think  that  the  colours  meant  anything  or  did  you  want  them  to  mean   something?   I  don't  think  they  meant  anything  really.    And  they  don't  have  to  because  with  that   kind  of  layout  it's  pretty  basic.    If  you  go  on  ITunes  they  have  the  same  thing   It's  a  basic  equalizer  view.       What  we're  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  fill  out  a  quick  questionnaire.

Do  you  identify  yourself  as  hard  of  hearing,  deaf,  deafened?   I  like  deafened.       About  how  old  are  you?   I  will  be  47.       Can  you  please  tell  me  a  bit  about  yourself?    Were  you  born  hearing?    Were  you  born   deaf?   I  was  born  premature.    My  mother  was  entering  her  7th  month  of  pregnancy  when  I   was  born.    They  did  not  quite  discover  until  I  was  five  years  old  that  I  was  born  with   profound  deafness.    I  remember  being  fitted  with  a  hearing  aid  at  six  years  of  age-- grade  1.    The  hearing  aid  didn't  really  do  much  for  me.    They  figured  I  had  what  they   called  sensory  neurological  loss.       Yes,  sensory  neural  loss.       Yes,  sensory  neural  loss,  profound  deafness--that  is  what  they  classified  it  as.      I   wore  a  hearing  aide  up  until  33  years  of  age.    I  became  deafened  for  no  known   reason.    I  seen  Dr.  Julian  Nedzelski,  Sunny  Brook  hospital,  to  be  a  candidate  for  the   cochlear  in  1997  in  December.    He  said  to  me  from  their  discovery  that  my  hair  cell   die  and  he  don't  know  why  and  that  the  cochlear  hair  cell  dying.    So  I  became  a   candidate  for  the  surgery.    I  had  the  surgery  the  week  before  Christmas  and  I  was   first  hooked  up  at  the  end  of  January  1998.   So  you  have  had  a  CI  since  1998?   Yes   So  from  what  you  are  telling  me,  at  different  stages  of  your  life  as  you  listen  to  music   things  sort  of  changed,  right?   Yes.       So  can  you  tell  me  a  little  bit  about  the  differences  between  what  you  experience  today   when  you  listen  to  music  compared  to  what  you  would  experience  in  the  past?   With  the  hearing  aid  in  the  past  I  was  able  to  pick  up  music  very  well.    I  can  hear  the   clarity  of  the  words  and  the  music  combined  very  well.        But  when  I  was  fitted  with   the  CI  I  couldn't  do  that  anymore.      And  I  mourn  the  loss  of  music.    In  the  past  I  was   able  to  play  the  clarinet  and  was  able  to  hear  it  well  and  also  differentiate  the  music   with  my  fingertips--the  vibration.    But  with  the  CI  I  couldn't.    And  I  was  very,  very   frustrated  that  I  couldn't  tell  where  I  was.    Even  with  the  vibration  I  couldn't  hear   that  tone,  that  level  of  what  that  sound  is.

So  today  you  can't  hear  music  at  all?   I  can  hear  some  music.    For  example,  if  it  is  music  from  the  past,  like  for  example,  I   am  a  Streisand  fan.    If  I  can  hear  the  simple  music  of  hers  like  "The  Way  We  Were"  or   "Evergreen",  I  will  pick  it  up  because  my  mind  is  memorizing  those  words.    And   especially  thank  God  for  YouTube  because  YouTube  allows  me  to  visualize  and  see   her  sing.    Without  the  visualization,  I  would  not  pick  it  up  as  much,  even  with  the   memory.       Do  you  think  what  you  listen  to  in  terms  of  your  music  preferences,  what  you  go  out   and  buy  or  whatever,  is  shaped  by  your  hearing  loss?    Is  shaped  by  your  hearing?   That  is  a  good  question  because  if  I  go  out  and  buy  a  video  or  music  right  now,  I   would  not  because  I  can't  recognize  it.      I  have  a  hard  time  recognizing.    I  might  hear   a  little  bit  of  a  violin,  or  a  bass  playing  or  a  guitar,  but  put  the  words  and  the  music   together,  no.    So  to  me  its  obsolete  of  purchasing  music  and  I  am  wasting  my  time   and  my  money.       So  when  you  do  listen  to  the  older  stuff  that  you  know  your  mind  will  help  you  fill  in,   what  strategies  do  you  use  to  help  you  enjoy  the  music?     I  have  a  laptop.    So  what  I  do  is  I  go  to  YouTube  and  plug  in  my  earphones.    I  put  the   big  earphones  over  top  of  the  mic  of  my  CI  and  I  listen  really  intently  to  it  to  see   what  is  it  I  can  pick  up?    What  is  it  that  my  mind  memorized  and  remembered  to   pick  up?    And  then  I  follow  through.    Now  most  music  have  video  captioning  that  I   will  try  and  match  it.  Like  for  an  example  last  night  with  Rita  McNeil  I  could  capture   maybe  out  of  7  words  in  a  sentence,  I  picked  up  3  or  4  maximum.    But  when  her   music  over  powers  her  voice,  I  can't.      Even  with  the  closed  captioning,  I  had  a  hard   time  following  it.    Because  when  there  is  closed  captioning  it's  not  like  following  her   right  on  cue.       Yeah,  it  was  live  caption  so  there  was  delay.       It  was  a  little  frustrating  because  I  love  her  music  and  want  to  hear  her  and  yet  I   could  not.               Do  you  wear  your  CI  when  you  listen  to  music?   Yes.   So  obviously  then  that  is  better  than  without,  right?   The  CI  is  much  better  than  the  hearing  aid,  if  I  were  to  make  comparison.    If  you   were  to  ask  me  this  6  years  ago,  I  would  of  [sic]  said  that  the  hearing  aid  is  better,   but  as  time  went  on,  getting  used  to  this,  I  can  say  the  CI  is  better  than  the  hearing   aid.    Because  it  is  picking  up  what  it  is  being  trained  to  pick  up.    Even  though  it  is

trained  for  voice--voice  recognition.    I  think  the  program  she  incorporated  included   music,  so  I  am  able  to  pick  up  music  a  bit  more,  but  not  as  much  as  I'd  like.       Do  you  play  around  with  your  stereo  settings  or  anything  like  that?       No,  I  don't  because  I  still  can't  tell  where  the  bass  is,  where  to  put  those  tone  areas.   When  you  want  to  listen  to  music,  do  you  try  and  put  yourself  into  a  quiet  room  or   something  like  that?    Do  you  manipulate  your  space?       I  try  to  put  myself  in  a  quiet  room,  especially  if  the  room  is  textured  like  this.    This  is   wall  texture.    And  the  music  is  not  echoing,  not  bouncing  off  the  wall,  I  will  be  able  to   pick  it  up  slightly  better.       You  were  telling  me  earlier  that  you  mostly  use  YouTube,  so  you're  not  usually   listening  to  an  iPod  or  something  like  that.    You  have  visual  information  while  you  are   listening.   I  go  to  YouTube  all  the  time.    It's  the  only  area  I  know  for  music  so  far.    Even  when   catching  up  with  news,  like  CBC  news  on  their  website  but  they  don't  have  close   caption,  so  that  is  why  I  go  to  YouTube  and  I  get  a  better  visual  on  YouTube  than  I  do   with  CBC.         If  a  computer  could  automatically  do  some  things  that  would  help  you  better   understand  music,  what  would  be  the  really  important  pieces  of  information  that  you   would  want  the  computer  to  help  you  to  know?   If  it's  closed  captioning,  so  I  can  follow.    Closed  captioning  is  really  important   because  it  allows  so  I  can  follow  word  for  word.    And  also  at  the  same  time,  I  am   training  myself  to  listen  for  the  words  and  I  can  quickly  glance  at  it  to  see  if  I  am  not   missing  anything.    So  it's  helping  me.    It's  training  me.    It's  doing  both.    So  its  help  me   train  and  listening.       So  now  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  show  three  quick  videos  these  are  music   visualizations  that  have  been  designed  at  Ryerson  and  elsewhere.    They're  not   necessarily  designed  to  help  deaf  people.    I  am  not  going  to  play  the  sound,  it`s  just   going  to  be  straight  video.         Straight  video,  OK   While  watching  the  videos,  what  I  would  like  you  to  do  is  keep  in  mind  how  you  would   interpret  what  it  is  your  looking  at  it.       OK,  how  am  I  going  to  interpret  it.    OK.    By  speech  reading...?   How  would  you  interpret  it  as...

Interpret  by  how  I  am  hearing  it.     What  it  means  to  you.       What  message  is  it  sending  to  me?         What  is  it  saying  to  you?    Those  kinds  of  things.   What  kind  of  body  language,  facial  expression...   Right.       (MOVING  CIRCLES  START)   (MOVING  CIRCLES  ENDS)   When  it  is  going  along,  I  notice  there  are  a  lot  of  circles.    I  notice  that  there  is  a   rhythm.    I  am  seeing  rhythm  in  there.  Now,  the  bright  light  that  goes  "ba-ding",  "ba- ding"--touching  each  ball--is  the  different  level  tones,  I  am  assuming.    So  it`s   following  it.    Because  I  study  music  in  Grade  9,  it's  indicating  to  me  that  I  am  hearing   different  instruments  in  there,  rather  reading  different  the  instruments  in  there.    So   in  my  mind  I  am  thinking  what  kind  of  level  tone  am  I  going  to  be  hearing  if  there   were  sound  on.    That  is  what  I  am  interpreting  from  this.       What  in  this  did  not  work  for  you?   As  it  runs  by  its  that  bar  that  goes  "ba-ding",  "ba-ding",  "ba-ding",  "ba-ding",  "ba- ding".    It`s  just  like,  what  is  that?   Oh  this  white  bar?   Yes  and  you  got  that  green  light.    It`s  like  a  distraction.    What  is  this  trying  to  tell  me?   Ok  that  is  interesting.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?   The  first  thing  I  noticed  of  the  colours  is  it  may  represent  the  different  tones  of  the   music.    It`s  very  attractive  and  it`s  not  harsh.    It`s  gentle  and  easy  to  follow.       What  did  you  think  of  the  speed?    Was  it  too  fast?    Too  slow?   I  find  that  the  speed  is  generally  normal.    It  is  what  a  hearing  person  would  listen  to.   Right.       Now  what  I  am  going  to  do  now  is  play  a  different  video,  but  the  same  song.       Same  song?

Same  song   I  wonder  if  I  would  recognize  it.       (RADAR  STARTS)   I  swear  there  is  a  drum  playing  in  there.       Pardon?   I  swear  there  is  a  drum  playing  in  there.  When  there  is  a  feather  like  that  might  be   the  drum.    The  heartbeat.    That  is  your  bass.     I  am  looking  at  a  clown.               This  one  is  very  attractive  and  easy  to  follow.       What  do  you  think  these  are?  What  do  you  think  these  moving...?   I  am  thinking  this  is  a  background  noise  or  something  or  gentle  music.    There  is   something  in  that  background.    That's  what  I  am  thinking  it  is.    This  is  your  bass,   which  is  the  foundation  of  the  music.    This  is  your  background.    The  feather  like   thing  is  like  a  thimble.    You  know  like...    Like  someone  playing  the  piano.    Going  like   this  with  the  piano.    That  could  be  anything.    The  red  could  be  your  drum,  it  could  be   your  guitar  or  anything  else.    And  I  find  that  very  attractive.           (RADAR  ENDS)   Did  you  find  anything  in  that  confusing?    It  just  didn't  work  for  you?           What  I  am  finding  very  annoying  is  that  purple  dot.    I  think  you  should  just  have  the   feather  like  thing  and  maybe  one  or  the  two  dots  and  you  decide.    That  is  acceptable.     But  if  you  try  to  add  a  bit  more  too  it,  it  becomes  very  annoying.    It's  confusing  and   annoying.       Did  colours  mean  anything  to  you?   Colours?      The  red  does  in  this  case.    The  number  one.    The  heartbeat,  as  I  mentioned   earlier--the  heartbeat.    The  colours  again  could  be  either  the  tone  or  it  could  be  the   words  being  sung...maybe  it`s  different  words.         What  about  the  speed?    Was  it  too  fast?    Too  slow?   It  was  easy  for  me  to  follow.    I  didn't  find  either.    It  was  very  comfortable.     I  am  going  to  show  you  one  more  video.         (BARS  STARTS)

(BARS  ENDS)   To  tell  you  the  truth  I  really  don't  like  that  one.    I  really  don't.    I  find  it  very,  very   annoying  and  upsetting.    I  find  too  many  actions  going  on  at  once.    Now,  if  I  were  a   producer  and  recorder,  I  would  probably  understand  it  further.      It  would  be  similar   to  what  they  have  at  their  studio.    But  no,  it  turned  me  off  right  off  the  bat.         Did  you  think  the  colours  had  any  meaning?   No,  it  has  no  meaning  to  me  whatsoever.    It's  like  monotone.    And  because  the   colours  are  blending  in...the  yellow  and  the  red  blend  in,  it  all  becomes  one.    It  has   no  meaning  to  me.       Did  you  find  it  too  fast,  too  slow  or  just  too  much?   It's  just  a  mixture.    It's  like  a  jumble.       So  that's  all  the  videos     OK.       What  I  am  going  to  do  now  is  just  get  you  to  fill  out  this  final  questionnaire.       OK.

So  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  ask  a  few  questions  about  you  and  who  you   are.    And  then  I  am  going  to  show  you  a  few  quick  videos  and  ask  you  a  few  questions   about  each  of  them.  And  then  we  will  have  a  bit  of  a  wrap  up  activity--a  short   questionnaire--and  that  will  be  it.       Do  you  identify  yourself  as  hard  of  hearing,  deafened,  deaf?    How  do  you  label  yourself,   if  you  do?   Hard  of  hearing.       If  I  may,  how  old  are  you?   55.       So,  were  you  born  hard  of  hearing?   Industrial  from  working  in  industry.    Working  the  mines  and  in  surface  plants--so   mine  is  work  related.       And  about  how  old  were  you  when  you  lost  your  hearing?     I  started  working  in  the  industry  at  about  19  and  it's  been  about  over  the  last  20   years  or  so...approximately.    I  think  I  was  losing  it,  but  I  didn't  really  realize  it.    Then   it  got  to  the  point  through  testing  that...   Then  it  became  more  obvious?   Then  it  became  more  obvious.       So  you  have  been  hard  of  hearing  from  about  30  or  35?       Probably  between  35  and  40  years  old.       So  what  kind  of  memories  do  you  have  of  music,  prior  to  when  you  lost  your  hearing?       Like  things  that  I  could  hear,  that  I  noticed?   Yeah.       Birds.    I  spend  a  lot  of  time  outside  in  the  bush  so  a  lot  of  the  nature  things  like  birds,   frogs.    Catching  words  on  TV,  catching  punch  lines  on  movies  and  films  and  having   to  ask  friends  to  repeat  themselves  quite  often  when  we're  together   With  respect  to  music,  when  you  were  younger  compared  to  now,  do  you  really  notice   a  difference  in  what  you  hear  and  what  you  remember?       Big  time,  yeah.

So  tell  me  a  little  about  that,  what  is  it  that  you  have  difficulty  hearing  today  when  you   listen  to  music,  compared  when  you  were  19  or  25?   Distinguishing  the  words.    Lots  of  times  I  have  to  be  face  to  face  if  people  talk  fast  or   if  the  words  bunch  in  too  quickly  together.    It  takes  longer  to  distinguish  or  figure   out  what's  being  said  and  just  trying  to  decipher  things  it's  slower.       When  you  were  younger,  you  had  a  record  collection  of  some  sort?                   Yeah,  the  45s  and  stuff.    And  I  could  understand,  I  could  listen  to  those  quite  well.  I   never  had  a  problem  with  those.       Today  when  you  listen  to  that  same  music--maybe  you  listen  to  it  on  a  CD  or   something  now--but  today,  when  you  listen  to  those  same  songs,  do  you  hear  them  the   same  way  or  do  you  hear  them  differently?       I  don't  hear  them  the  same.    Lots  of  them  I  know  what  the  words  will  be  because  you   have  listened  to  them  for  so  long,  so  lots  of  the  stuff  is  by  memory.    But  some  of  the   music  on  some  of  the  CDs  or  records  I  would  have  had  would  be...--the  more   familiar  songs  I  go  better  with.    But  the  ones  I  didn't  listen  to  quite  as  much  you  have   to  really  pay  attention  to  catch  it  all.       So  when  you  hear  the  stuff  you're  really  familiar  with,  do  you  think  you're  still  hearing   the  same  tune  or  are  there  big  gaps?   I  am  not  sure.    I  think  I  am  anticipating.    Like  there  are  times  you  sort  of  anticipate   what  an  answer  is  going  to  be,  so  it's  locked  in  to  your  mind  that's  what  the  answer   is  going  to  be,  so  that's  sort  of  what  you  hear.    Sometimes  I  think  that  in   conversations  or  when  things  are  going  on,  I  am  actually  guessing  or  as  the  word   came  up  over  the  weekend,  bluffing  my  way  through  sometimes.    Sometimes  you  get   lucky  and  sometimes  you  answer  out  in  left  field.       What  strategies  do  you  use  today  when  you  want  to  listen  to  music?    What  kind  of   things  do  you  do  to  help  you  when  you  want  to  listen  to  music?   If  I  am  alone  I  will  turn  the  volume  up.       Get  it  louder.       Yeah,  if  I  am  by  myself.    I  just  tried  using  [brand  name]  machine  with  a  neck  loop   and  the  headphones  and  that  made  it  a  lot  better.   Yeah,  yeah.       If  I  am  in  a  quiet  room  and  I  can  get  away  from  any  background  noises  and  stuff,  that   makes  a  big  difference.        If  I  can  be  sitting  facing  the  speaker  or  facing  wherever  the   sound  is  coming  from,  that  makes  a  big  difference.

Do  you  try  and  do  these  as  much  as  possible?   Yeah,  pretty  much.    I  try  to  set  myself  up  where  it's  going  to  be  to  my  benefit  the   most.       You  were  hearing  aids,  correct?   All  the  time,  yeah.       Do  you  find  the  hearing  aids  help  you?       Yes,  very  much.    If  I  take  them  out,  even  in  the  kitchen,  if  I  take  them  out,  I  don't  hear   the  fridge  running,  I  don't  hear  the  furnace  running,  I  don't  hear  a  lot  of  those  things.       So  when  you  listen  to  music,  you  wear  hearing  aids  as  well?   Yeah,  music,  watching  TV,  just  about  everything.       When  you  want  to  listen  to  music,  what  do  you  usually  do?    Do  you  use  a  stereo,  or  a   radio,  or  some  sort  of  iPod?    How  do  you  do  it?    What  do  you  do  to  listen  to  music?       Usually  it's  the  CD  player,  the  little  portable  one.    If  I  am  sitting  in  the  living  room,  I   will  have  the  TV  set  on  one  of  the  Galaxy  stations  or  something.       Do  you  find  one  or  the  other  to  be  better  for  you?   It's  all  in  positioning.   It's  all  the  same.       If  I  were  ever  to  build  another  house,  I  would  probably  have  it  with  speakers  in   every  room  because  if  I  go  from  one  room  to  the  next  I  will  lose  it,  unless  if  I  have   the  headphone  set  on,  then  I  can  wander  around.       You  were  saying  earlier  that  lyrics  seem  to  be  a  problem  for  you  now;  you  are  not   hearing  the  words  very  much.    What  other  stuff  do  you  find  really  frustrating  when   you're  trying  to  listen  to  music?    What  else  is  really  frustrating  for  you?   Sometimes  the  instruments  block  out  the  words.       The  music  is  over  bearing.       Sometimes  I  can  hear  the  instruments  more  than  the  words,  depending  on  the  tones   that  are  coming  in.       What  do  you  think  would  help  you?    What  do  you  think  would  improve  your  experience   with  music?

If  I  had  one  of  those  FM  headphone  sets  or  the  neck  loops  seem  to  have  helped  when   I  used  it  for  a  week.    Probably  it's  just  the  only  thing  that  could  really  help  is  make   myself  in  the  right  position  and  not  have  a  bunch  obstacles  in  front  of  me  or   anything  blocking  the  speaker  where  the  voices  are  coming  from.         Is  this  your  first  CHHA  conference?     Yeah   OK,  so  you're  really  beginning  to  experience  some  new  ideas  this  weekend,  eh?   Yeah,  well  actually  what  happened  was  when  I  took  the  Lip  Reading  and  Speech  10   week  course,  I  really  got  a  lot  of  ideas  through  that,  just  through  the  Sudbury   chapter  here  and  with  the  instructor  we  had,  he  explained  to  us  in  the  group  that  I   was  in  a  lot  of  the  opportunities  and  a  lot  of  the  stuff  that  is  out  there.    And  when  I   went  and  seen  them  at  the  Sudbury  Hard  of  Hearing  office,  they  told  me  about  the   CHHA  conference.   Conference.   Yeah  and  this  has  really  been  great.    I  have  met  a  lot  of  good  people  and  got  a  lot  of   good  ideas  and  stuff.    It's  been  very  beneficial.           The  more  you  explore  what  is  out  there,  the  more  you  experiment  and  try  stuff  out.     You  never  know.       If  you  wanted  to  use  a  computer  to  help  you  better  understand  music,  what  would  be   the  really  important  pieces  of  information,  the  really  important  stuff  in  the  music,  that   you  would  want  the  computer  to  just  automatically  to  do?   First  of  all,  I  don't  touch  the  computer.    I  am  not  in  the  computer  era  yet,  but  if  I  was   going  to  have  a  computer  and  stuff,  I  am  not  really  sure  because  I  am  not  too  much   into  the  technical  end  of  things  and  stuff,  one  that  you  could  almost  see  the  words  as   its  playing  might  help  but  then  you'd  have  to  sit  down  to  do  it.    It's  not  something   you  could  use  as  you're  driving  down  the  road  or  nothing.       No,  exactly.   I  think  the  biggest  thing  I  have  used  besides  the  hearing  aids  was  the  stereo  type   heading  phones  that  you  can  use  with  the  TV  or  that  you  could  plug  into  your   machine.   With  the  big  jack?       Yeah.

So  now  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  show  you  some  short  music  videos.    Sorry,  some  short   videos  of  music  visualizations.    So  what  these  things  are,  is  they  are  software,  computer   software,  that  presents  music  information  in  a  particular  way.    They  are  not  all   designed  to  support  deaf  or  hard  of  hearing  people  and  some  of  them  have  been   developed  at  Ryerson  and  some  have  not.    I  don't  want  you  to  think  that  anything  is   necessarily  my  work.    I  will  not  play  the  sound.    I  will  only  play  the  video.    And  as  you   watch  it,  what  I  would  like  you  do  is  keep  in  the  back  of  your  mind  how  you  would   interpret  this  thing.    What  it  means  to  you.    What  it  says  to  you.       (MOVING  CIRCLE  STARTS)   (MOVING  CIRCLE  ENDS)   So  did  this  video  say  anything  to  you?   To  me  it  just  looks  like  something  that  is  getting  deleted  as  it  goes  across.     Everything  is  disappearing.    I  couldn't  really  hear  anything  on  it.   No,  there's  no  sound.       It  just  looked  like  something  being  deleted  off  of  a...erasing  something  off  a  board  or   something.       So  it  didn't  look  like  music  to  you?   Not  really,  no.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?       Sort  of  a  pale  blue.    The  colours  don't  really  do  much  for  me.    Black.   Was  this  video  too  fast,  too  slow?     Going  across  it  was  a  good  speed.    It  wasn't  really  fast  or  very  slow.      It  just  seen  the   ball  sort  of  thing  going  up  and  down  and  seemed  to  delete  things  as...     So  what  I  am  going  to  do  now  is  show  you  a  second  video.   (BARS  STARTS)   (BARS  ENDS)   So  did  this  video  say  anything  to  you?   It  just  brings  back  memories  of  the  old  days  when  they  came  out  with  speakers  that   had  lights  that  flashed  on  and  off,  like  back  in  the  70s  I  guess--when  I  was  young   and  I  had  hair.

(David  laughs)   As  far  as  if  there  was  music  or  anything  to  it,  the  flashing  up  and  down  I  find  more  of   a  distraction  to  me,  then  actually...I  would  be  watching  or  concentrating  more  on   the  light  movement  more  than  the  music.       Did  you  find  the  colours  to  have  any  meaning  for  you?       No,  all  I  could  visualize  is  a  stereo  system  with  a  set  of  speakers  with  blue,  purple   and  red  lights  that  flashed  on  and  off  and  stuff   What  did  you  think  of  the  speed?    Was  it  too  fast,  too  slow?   No,  speed  was  a...   Wasn't  a  factor.       (RADAR  STARTS)   (RADAR  ENDS)   So  did  that  video  say  anything  to  you?   No,  if  it's  supposed  to  do  anything  to  sort  of  make  music  or  sound  better  or  anything,   it  would  be  more  of  a  distraction  than  help  anything     Did  you  find  any  of  it  to  give  you  any  meaning?   No,  just  lights.         Just  a  lot  of  lights   Lights  going  on  and  off  in  circles  and  stuff.    But  as  far  as  interpreting  ....  The  only   thing  that  flashed  in  my  mind  from  that  with  the  round  circle  is  if  they  would  of  had   something  like  that  for  Test  Pattern  when  they  had  the  Indian  Chief  on  the  old  CBC  it   would  give  it  some  movement  or  something  to  it.       Right.       So  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  give  you  this  last  quick  questionnaire  and  I  am  going  to   step  off  and  get  the  next  person.    I  will  be  right  back.       I  don't  know  if  I  was  much  help,  but  I  found  that  none  of  that  stuff  actually  made  me   think  of  any  music  or  any  beats  or  anything.    It  was  just  squiggly  cut  lines  going  up   and  down.    I  found  if  I  was  at  a  concert  of  something,  I'd  much  rather  look  at  a  blank   screen  and  listen  to  the  music  then  try  and  listen  to  music  with  a  bunch  of  lights   going  on  and  off.

Can  you  please  tell  me  how  do  you  identify  yourself--hard  of  hearing,  deaf,  deafened,  none  of   those,  all  of  those?   I  am  hard  of  hearing.       You  call  yourself  hard  of  hearing?   Yeah.   Can  you  please  advise  about  how  old  you  are?   I  am  in  my  sixties,  my  late  sixties.       Late  sixties,  OK.       Were  you  born  hard  of  hearing  or  did  you  experience  a  hearing  loss?   No,  I  suffered  acute  hearing  loss  about  a  year  ago.     Oh,  OK.   I  was  driving  down  the  street  at  home...everything  went  silent.    It's  called  acute  hearing   loss.               Yeah,  just  immediate.       Given  that  hearing  loss  has  been  so  recent  you  have  a  lot  of  memories  of  music  that  you've   listened  to  for  quite  a  while  now.       Oh  yeah,  my  whole  life.       What  is  the  difference  today  from  what  you  were  experiencing  up  until  last  year?   I  can't  get  any  melody  in  anything.    Music  to  me  now  is  just  noise.    I  can't  differentiate  what   song  is  being  sung.    At  the  Rita  MacNeil  concert  last  night,  for  example--I  was  very  good  fan   of  hers--I  couldn't  tell  what  song.    Everyone  would  clap  when  they  would  hear  the  song   being  started.    Well  I  couldn't  get  the  melody.    When  I  look  at  the  words  of  course  I  know   the  words  of  the  song,  so  I  knew  what  she  is  singing.    So  music  is  just  gone,  it's  lost.    It's   really  weird  because  my  two  hearing  aids--which  I  purchased  about  two  months  after  I   had  the  hearing  loss--I  am  doing  very  well,  functioning  very  well  with  conversation,  but   music  is  just  gone.    I  was  in  choirs  my  whole  life.    In  fact,  I  played  the  piano.    I  used  to  play   the  organ  in  Church.    I  can't  even  do  that  know  because  if  I  play  the  piano  now  or  the  organ   what  I  am  playing  is  right,  it's  perfectly  the  right  keys,  but  to  me  it  sounds  like  what  am  I   playing?    It's  nothing  like  what  it  should  be  sounding.    It's  really  weird.       The  stuff  that  is  familiar  to  you...the  stuff  that  you  know  you  should  be  hearing...you`re  still   able  to  hear  some  music,  but  you're  not  able  to  hear  enough  to  make  it  meaningful?

To  make  it  meaningful  or  to  enjoy  it.       Right.       I  just  can't  enjoy  it.    I  used  to  love  going  to  concerts.    Particularly  coming  from   Newfoundland,  we  are  into  Irish  music  a  lot.     Yes,  I  am  sure.   I  go  to  see  a  lot  of  Irish  tenors.   A  lot  of  Celtic  stuff.       Now  all  my  nice  Irish  tenors  now  when  they  come  visit,  there  is  not  much  point  in  me  going   because  I  am  hearing  them,  but  I  am  not  getting  the  nice  quality  of  their  voice  and  I  am  not   even  getting  enough  to  tell  me  what  song  they  are  singing.       Are  you  able  to  hear  the  lyrics  at  all?   No,  not  really.    Like  I  say,  the  only  way  I'll  know  it  is  if  you  said  to  me  oh  that's--pick  an   Irish  song--that's  Galway  Bay  they  are  singing.    Well,  because  I  know  Galway  Bay,  then  I   can  get  what  he's  singing,  but  it's  my  own  memory.    I  think  I  am  drawing  on  that  tells  me   what  he  is  singing.       I  have  you  tried  experimenting  with  coming  up  with  strategies  that  might  help  you   understand  or  might  help  you  gain  a  better  experience?       Well  I  have  gone  to  every  audiologist  I  know  and  I  made  a  special  appointment  with   Marshall  Chasin,  who  was  one  of  our  speakers.    I  think  you  were  in  the  same  session.           Yup.   Well,  I  met  with  him  the  night  before  he  spoke  and  he  gave  me  a  couple  of  techniques  to  try.     He  said  when  you  go  to  Rita  MacNeil  tomorrow  night  put  scotch  tape--he  mentioned  it  in   his  presentation--put  scotch  tape  on  your  hearing  aide.       And  did  that  help?   It  didn't  help  a  damn  bit.    He  said  take  out  this  hearing  aide  (points  to  right  ear)  because  he   said  I  have  a  high  frequency  loss  in  this  ear  and  I  don't  know  what  I  got  in  this  ear  (points   to  left  ear)--probably  a  low  frequency  loss,  but  just  take  this  one  out  (right  ear)  and  it   might  help.    I  did  that.    I  put  the  scotch  tape  on.    I  still  couldn't  tell  what  Rita  MacNeil  was   singing.     And  if  you  have  taken  them  both  off?   Well  then,  I  wouldn't  hear  anything.

OK.   Noise  to  me  now  is  just...I  mean  music  to  me  now  is  just  noise.    There  is  nothing  pleasant.   You  know?   There's  nothing  pleasant.       When  you're  at  home  and  you  want  to  listen  to  the  stereo  or  play  your  piano  or  your  organ...   Yeah.   You're  basically  not  even  doing  it  anymore  right  now?   I  am  not  even  doing  it  because  I  sit  down  to  play  a  song  that  I  am  quite  familiar  with   because  I  play  by  ear  as  well  as  by  note,  well  I'd  say  to  my  husband,  "What  am  I  playing?   What  am  I  playing?"  He'd  say,  "You're  playing  that  perfectly,  perfectly  right"  Well,  I'd  say   "It's  not  coming  out  like  the  song  I  know."  You  know?         My  grandmother  lost  hearing  fairly  late  in  life  as  well.    She  also,  same  thing,  this  is  a  women   who  grew  up  in  a  Presbyterian  Church  all  her  life   Sang  all  the  time.   Mostly  played  the  organ,  played  the  piano,  that  kind  of  stuff.       So  one  of  the  things  she  ended  up  doing  was  she  used  really  high-powered  headphones  on  her   organ.   Under  the  organ?   She  would  plug  it  into  the  organ           Plug  it  in,  yeah.         So  instead  of  the  organ  giving  out  sound,  all  the  sound  would  go  into  the  headphones.       Oh,  OK   That  seemed  to  work  for  her,  but  she  was  not  like  you.    She  was  more  hard  of  hearing  and  then   she  lost  that  over  time  too.    By  the  time  she  passed  away,  she  was  very  severely  hard  of   hearing.       Really?   But  that  was  a  strategy  that  seemed  to  work  for  her.    So  obviously  one  of  things  you're  doing   right  now  is  looking  for  strategies  that  are  going  to  help  you.       I  am,  yeah.

If  you  wanted  a  computer  to  sort  of  do  this  automatic  kind  of  thing,  to  kind  of  help  you  with   music  and  with  the  music  experience,  what  would  you  want  the  computer  to  do?   Well,  I  guess  if  it  could  in  some  way  allow  me  to  hear  notes  again--to  actually  hear  the   music.    Now  I  know  when  I  went  back  north  to  do  some  of  this...I  think  some  of  this  is  from   visualization.   Yeah,  that's  right.    I'll  show  you  some  visualizations.                 I  don't  know.    I  can't  imagine  that  being  the  same  thing  as  sitting  and  hearing  the  song   word.    You  know?   Right,  yeah.       Well  it's  not  going  to  be  the  same  thing,  but  may  be  it  might  give  you  some  thoughts  on  ways   to  support  what  you  don't  hear  now.       OK,  so  what  I  am  going  to  do  is,  as  I  said  earlier,  I  am  going  to  show  you  some  short  videos  of   music  visualizations.    Now,  these  visualization  have  been  developed  in  various  places--some   at  Ryerson  and  some  at  various  other  places.    Some  of  the  videos  have  not  been  developed   specifically  with  deaf  people  in  mind,  so  I  just  want  to  warn  you  about  that.    I  am  not  going  to   play  the  sound;  you  won't  hear  anything  because  I  am  not  running  anything  for  sound.    So  if   you're  wondering  why  you're  not  hearing  anything,  I  am  not  playing  the  sound.    As  you  watch   the  videos,  what  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  sort  of  keep  in  the  back   of  your  mind  how  you  would  interpret  it?    What  it  might  mean  to  you?    What  it  says  to  you?     Those  kinds  of  things.    OK?   OK.       So  this  is  the  first  video.       (BARS  STARTS)   (BARS  ENDS)   Did  that  video  say  anything  to  you?   It  reminded  me  of  fountains  spraying  up  in  Vegas  when  I  was  there.    You  would  go  to  some   casinos  and  all  the  fountains  would  be  spraying  up.    I  could  imagine  that  was  being  done  to   the  beat  of  some  fast  jazz  music  and  as  the  piece  went  on  it  intensified;  the  music   intensified.    I  could  almost  visualize  everybody  getting  into  it,  you  know?       What  in  that  did  not  work  for  you?    What  just  went  uh?    You  know?   I  liked  it.    Nothing  really  jumped  out  at  me  to  dislike  it.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?

They  were  OK.    I  liked  the  pink,  red...yeah.    I  liked  the  bright  colours.       Did  the  colours  mean  anything  to  you?   No.   Did  you  want  the  colours  to  mean  anything  to  you?   I  was  just  trying  to  get  a  sense  what  the  colours  all  seem  to  be  dancing  together  and  I  was   just  trying  to  get  a  sense  of  the  beat  of  it  all.    The  colours  themselves  didn't  mean  anything.     I  probably  would  of  gotten  the  same  feeling  if  it  had  been  yellow  colours.    I  don't  know.       What  about  the  speed  of  video?    Did  you  find  the  video  too  fast?  Too  slow?   It  got  a  little  fast  towards  the  end   OK.   Was  it  fast  for  you  or  fast  in  general?   No,  it  was  fast.    It  seemed  to  have  sped  up.    The  dancing  images  seemed  to  have  sped  up.       OK   So,  I  am  going  to  show  you  the  next  video  now.       (RADAR  STARTS)   (RADAR  ENDS)   What  did  that  video  say  to  you?   I  didn't  get  as  much  out  of  that  one.    I  found  that  one  more  difficult  to  interpret.    It  just   seemed  to  be  a  series  of  fans  spreading  out.    And  once  again,  as  it  got  towards  the  end  of  it,   they  spread  out  farther.    They  are  encompassing  more  space.    But,  that  one  wasn't  speaking   to  me  as  well  as  the  first  one.       Those  fans,  did  that  mean  anything  to  you?   No.   Did  their  movement  say  anything  to  you?   No.           What  about  the  big  circles?    Did  that  say  anything  to  you?   No,  I  just  wondered  what  they  had  to  do  with  it  all  when  they  appeared.   OK.

What  did  you  think  about  the  colours?   I  would  of  perhaps  liked  more  bright  colours.    You  see  the  odd  black  and  white.    I  would  of   preferred  more  vibrant  colours,  although  there  was  the  odd  blue  in  there  and  the  odd   colour  in  there.    I  didn't  like  the  colours  as  well.       Did  you  feel  the  colours  had  any  meaning  to  you  at  all?   No,  they  perhaps  wouldn't  make  me  as  happy  as  the  first  one.    I  did  not  feel  as  happy   watching  that.       Did  you  want  the  colours  to  have  meaning  for  you  in  some  way?   No,  not  really.    I  just  thought  that  they  should.    The  purpose  of  this  is  they  should  have   meaning,  but  I  wasn't  getting  any...   Anything  out  of  it?   Anything  out  of  it.     What  about  the  speed?    Was  it  too  fast  for  you?    Too  slow  for  you?   The  last  part  once  again  was  a  little  too  fast.    When  it  started  spreading  out  it  picked  up   speed.     So  this  is  the  last  one.       (MOVING  CIRCLES  STARTS)   (MOVING  CIRCLES  ENDS)   So  what  did  you  think  of  that  video?   That  reminded  me  of  the  very,  very  olden  days,  the  black  and  white  pictures  days,  when   there  was  no  colour  at  all  and  then  towards  the  end  some  colour  came  in  and  then  I  could   see  maybe  some  old  fashioned  music.       When  you  were  watching  that  video  did  it  say  anything  to  you  that  would  be  music?   I  kind  of  thought  about  Fred  Astaire  and  Ginger  Rogers  swaying  on  to  something  like  that.     Now  I  know  he  was  a  tap  dancer  but  you  know  some  this  ballroom  stuff.    I  could  somehow   visualize  some  ballroom  into  that.     OK.       Ballroom  dance  I  mean,  you  know?   Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

As  you  were  watching  this  video  was  there  anything  about  the  video  that  really  confused  you?   Confused  me?   Yeah.   I  wondered  what  the  large,  towards  the  end  once  again,  what  the  large  surface  came  into,   what  they  had  to  with  it  all.    They  didn't  seem  to  belong  with  the  flow  that  was  going  on.     They  seemed  to  be  in  congress  with  what  was  going  on  before.       OK.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?   Once  again,  not  enough  colour  for  me.       Not  enough  for  you?   Yeah.   Not  that  the  colour  wasn't  bright  enough.    The  colour  wasn't  vibrant  enough--the  colours   themselves.       Right.     I  tend  to  like  bright  colours,  you  know  reds  and  greens  and...     OK.     Did  you  find  this  visualization  too  fast  or  did  you  find  it  too  slow?   No,  I  didn't  find...I  would  say  the  first  part  of  it  was  perhaps  a  nice  even  pace.    The  last  part   would  of  probably  been  a  little  too  fast.     OK.   What  I  am  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  give  you  this  quick  questionnaire.    So  if  I  can  get  you   to  fill  this  out.    And  I  will  be  right  back  I  am  just  going  to  go  get  my  next  person,  so  they   know  I  haven't  forgotten  them.

So  to  start,  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  ask  you  a  few  questions  about  yourself  and  your   experiences  with  music  and  that  kind  of  stuff  and  then  what  I  will  do  is  switch  to  the  videos.    I   will  show  you  three  short  videos.    After  each  video  I  will  ask  you  a  few  questions.    And  then   once  we  have  finished  all  three  videos,  I  will  give  you  a  wrap  up  questionnaire  and  we  will  just   wrap  up  from  there.    OK?     OK.   So  to  start,  how  do  you  identify  yourself--hearing,  hard  of  hearing,  deaf?   Hard  of  hearing.       And  if  you  don't'  mind,  about  how  old  are  you?   58.      Actually  I  am  almost  59,  so  whichever  you  want.       Were  you  born  hard  of  hearing?   No,  I  have  been  slowly  losing  my  hearing  over  the  last  10  years  or  so.       Oh  OK.   I  first  started  really  noticing  it  10,  maybe  12  years  ago...admitting  it  10  years  ago.       OK  (laughing).       Are  you  continuing  to  lose  hearing?   Yeah,  it's  getting  worse.       What  memories  do  you  have  of  listening  to  music  before  your  hearing?    Do  you  have  a  fairly   good  memory  of  listening  to  music?       Oh  yeah,  really  good.    I've  listened  to  music  since  I  was  a  young  kid.    We  weren't  a  musical   family,  but  I  loved  listening  to  music  as  a  teenager.    I  sang  in  choirs  all  through  public   school  and  high  school.    I  sang  in  an  adult  community  choir  for  a  number  of  years.    I  don't   read  music,  but  I  catch  on  pretty  quickly;  I  have  a  fairly  good  ear.    So  I  try  participating  as   well.    I  have  continued  to  listen  to  music  all  my  life  as  an  adult.    But  definitely  I've  noticed   since  my  hearing  has  started  going,  its  tinged  a  little  bit  by  the  fact  I  cannot  hear  the  lyrics  if   its  vocal,  if  its  music  that  has  lyrics.    I  like  instrumental  music  also,  but  I  miss  it  when  I  am   missing  the  words.    It's  not  just  quite  the  same.   So  the  recordings--I  mean  I  assume  you  have  a  CD  collection  or  an  album  collection  of  some   sort--so  the  recording  you  have  from  10  or  20  years  ago,  that  you  are  quite  familiar  with,   when  you  play  them  now  do  you  really  notice  a  difference?   Yeah,  I  am  relieved  often  that  I  know  the  words.

Right.       Because  I  know  I  am  not  really  hearing  what  they're  saying  clearly  anymore.       What  about  the  melody  and  the  music  its  self?   I  can  still  follow  that.    My  hearing  is  still  alright  that  I  can  follow  the  music.    But...I  just   became  involved  with  [org.] .    I  took  a  speech  reading  class  from     recently,  so  I've   just  become  more  consciously  aware,  like  the  women  that  just  spoke  at  the  end  of  the  last   session  there...how  powerful  it's  been  for  her...it's  been  very  similar  for  me.    So  it's  made   me  more  conscious  of  looking  at  ways  my  hearing  loss  has  affected  me.    And  one  of  them   has  been,  at  some  level,  of  which  I  am  now  more  aware,  I  am  wondering  how  much  I   missing  auditorily  now  in  terms  of  listening  to  a  classical  piece  or...I  am  not  sure.    I  can   definitely  still  follow  it.    I  have  a  good  sense  of  rhythm,  which  helps  me.    And  I  don't  know   really  because  I  can't  tell;  I  can  still  enjoy  music.                     Right.       But,  yeah.       You  were  saying  earlier  that  you  have  a  tendency  to  listen  to  instrumental  music.      Do  you   think  that  your  loss  of  hearing  has  shaped,  I  don't  know,  what  it  is  you  listen  to?   That's  interesting.    I  haven't  thought  of  that.    It  might.    I  have  sometimes  thought  it's  just   because  I  am  getting  older.    Except,  I  still  like  Rock  n  Roll.    I  still  like  Rap.    I  still  like  the  old   stuff  I  use  to  listen  to  in  the  70s,  so  I  still  like  that  stuff  also.       Beatles,  Elvis...   I  still  liked  classical  then  as  well.    But...that's  very  interesting.    Maybe,  I  am  going  to  have  to   think  about  that  one.    That's  very  possible  because  it's  easier.    It's  like  how  not  going  out  is   easier  than  going  out  sometimes.    So  that  kind  of  strikes  a  chord  with  me.    There  is   probably  something  to  that  for  me.               When  you  listen  to  music,  what  kinds  of  things  do  you  do?    What  kinds  of  strategies  do  you  try   to  enjoy  the  experience  more?   I  definitely  like  listening  to  familiar  music  and  again  I  started  on  your  questionnaire  earlier   and  that  got  me  thinking  too,  and  I  think  that's  partly  because  it's  easy.    I  definitely,   especially  in  recent  years,  if  I  can  have  the  J  card.    I  don't  know  if  they  call  that  with  CDs,  but   you  know  with  audio  tapes  it's  called  the  J  card  that  has  the  words  on  it.     With  the  album  it  was  the  liner...the  liner  notes.       Now  with  the  CDs  whatever  they  call  that  then.    If  I  can  have  that,  especially  the  first  few   times  I  listen  to  the  music  because  I  do  like  to  sing  along  with  it,  I  enjoy  the  whole  thing  a   lot  more  if  I  can  be  reading  the  words...because  I  simply  can't  catch  a  lot  of  it

anymore...without  that.    I  can  still  hear  the  music.    All  the  rhythm,  all  that  is  fine.    But  again   I  don't  know  what  I  might  be  missing  anymore...but  I  can  still  enjoy  it.    I  like  to  follow  the   words  along.    I  turn  it  up  louder,  which  now  I  learned  from     in  our  speech  reading   classes  it  was  actually  doing  me  harm...somewhat...could  be  doing  me  harm.    But  I  also   always  liked  it  loud.       My  brother  sometimes  says  certain  things  were  intended  to  be  played  loud.       Yeah,  just  blast  it,  you  know?   Yeah.       I  like  the  words.    I  like  familiarity.    I  like  it  loud.    I  do  find  myself  trying  to  get  closer  to  the   source  of  the  music.       So  you  will  sit  next  to  the  speaker  or  something?   Yeah,  to  try  and  be  nearer.    I  find  now,  I  don't  have  a  stereo  at  the  moment--but  I  want  to   get  one--but  one  of  my  kids  was  home  for  a  while  and  he  had  a  really  nice  stereo,  but  I  had   to  either  blast  it  to  hear  it  elsewhere  in  the  house--we  don't  have  a  really  big  house,  but-- or  I  had  to  be  into  the  living  to  really  feel  like  I  was  hearing.    That  I  could  tell,  If  I  was  in   another  room,  moving  around,  doing  whatever,  even  with  it  fairly  loud,  if  I  moved  back  into   the  living  room  I  was  getting  a  fuller  sound,  so  I  am  clearly  missing  some  of  the   sound...when  I  am  not  there.           You  wear  hearing  aids,  right?   No,  I  am  in  the  process  of...I'll  be  getting  them.       Oh.         Just  before  I  heard  about  the  speech  reading  class,  I  thinking,  "OK,  it's  time  to  get  retested"   because  10  years  ago  I  was  told  hearing  aids  would  not  help  me.      And  then  I  heard  about   the  speech  reading  class...took  that,  went  to  the  audiologist,  got  tested,  but  I  was  just  about   to  get  my  knee  replaced,  so  she  said  these  are  two  big  changes  in  your  life,  why  don't  you   just  deal  with  the  knee  and  when  that  is  settled,  come  back  and  we'll  look  at  the  hearing   aide.       So  you  haven't  been  fitted  for  a  hearing  aid  yet?   Not  yet.   Interesting,  interesting.   You  were  saying  that  when  you  listen  to  music,  you  were  using  your  son's  home  stereo.    What   do  you  like  to  do?    Do  you  use  an  iPod  or  a  Walkman  or  what?

I  don't  have  one.    Part  of  it  was  I  was  leery  to  get  an  iPod--this  was  again  before  I  took  the   speech  reading  class--because  I  thought  I  can't  imagine  how  that  would  be  good  for  me,   with  already  damaged  hearing,  I  wasn't  sure,  so  I've  just  always  not.    Until  you  know  I   thought  one  of  these  days  I  will  look  into  it  and  then  I  took  the  class  and  she  said  it's  not   great.           You  have  to  be  aware...One  of  the  nice  things  about  an  iPod  is  you  can  set  it  to  max  at  a   certain  point.    So  it  will  never  get  louder  than  a  certain  point.       Yeah,  she  was  telling  us  about  that.    Levelers  and...   Where  that  doesn't  exist  with  stuff  like  Walkmans.    But  what  I  am  sort  of  trying  to  get  at  is   what  kind  of  stuff  do  you  use  when  you  want  to  listen  to  music?   My  laptop  or  I  listen  in  the  car.    I  have  an  old  stereo  downstairs,  so  when  I  am  downstairs  I   am  playing  something  on  there.   Your  laptop,  your  car  radio,  your  stereo  in  the  basement--which  of  the  three  do  you  find   really  works  best  for  you?   Sound  wise.    The  sound  of  the  music  itself.    I'd  say  the  stereo  in  the  basement  because  it  has   half  decent  speakers...for  a  fuller  sound.    You  know  the  laptop  has  tiny  little  speakers;  I   don't  have  extra  speakers  for  it.       So  then  you  tend  to  enjoy  music  more  when  it's  in  your  basic  stereo?   Either  that  or  the  car.    My  car  stereo  is  not  bad.       Oh  OK.       Currently,  my  CD  player  is  broken,  but  that's  just  the  last  couple  weeks  and  so  that  will  get   fixed.    It's  pretty  nice  in  my  car  and  then  in  my  husband's  car.       Do  you  listen  to  the  radio  in  your  car  pretty  much  all  the  time?   The  radio  yes,  but  as  often  as  not  it's  the  CBC,  so  not  always  a  lot  of  music...depending   when  I  am  driving  somewhere,  I'd  be  listening  or  I  am  putting  in  my  own  CDs.    If  I  am   driving  a  long  distance,  I  usually  stick  in  my  own  CDs.       Other  than  the  lyrics,  what  other  frustrations  do  you  find  you  have  when  you  listen  to  music?   I  think  just  that  thing  I  was  mentioning  before,  that  I  realized  that  when  my  son  was  living   at  home  for  about  7  months,  with  a  really  nice  stereo,  and  really  realizing  that  when  I   wasn't  in  the  living  room,  I  was  definitely  missing  some  of  the  music,  not  just  the  lyrics.       So  if  you  wanted  to  use  a  computer  then,  to  help  you  better  understand  or  help  you  have  a   better  experience  or  something  like  that,  what  would  be  the  most  important  pieces  of

APPENDIX E. ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS

information?    What  would  be  the  most  important  things  in  the  music  that  you  would  want   this  computer  to  show  you?       The  lyrics,  if  there  are  lyrics.    I  did  do  part  of  your  questionnaire,  I  like  the  idea  of  it  naming   the  instruments  that  are  playing  because  I  know  music  well  enough  that  it  might  help  me   identify  what  I  am  hearing.    I  also  really  like  the  idea,  because  my  rhythm  is  good,  and  I   depend  a  lot  on  rhythm  for  enjoyment  and  I  find  even  in  speech  reading  it  helps  me.      And  I   love  colour  and  I  use  colour  a  lot  in  my  life,  so  the  idea--and  I  have  no  idea  what  you're   thinking  of  doing  with  your  research--kind  of  like  the  Windows  music  thing  that  has  the   colour,  whatever  that  is.    I  don't  like  those  in  particular  but  I  do  notice  I  like  the  idea  of   colour  and  pattern  being  attached  to  music  because  I  am  pretty  visual.    But  like  I  say,  I  don't   necessarily  always  like  what  they  do  with  it,  but  I  like  the  idea.       What  kinds  of  patterns,  what  kinds  of  colours,  do  you  think  would  really  work?   The  colours  would  be  tricky  because  colour  means  different  things  to  so  many  different   people.    Different  cultures,  different  ages,  different  genders--all  that  stuff.       Absolutely.       I  think  the  rhythm  of  the  patterns  changing.    What  is  the  name  of  that?    What  can't  I  think  of   that?    Windows...   You're  thinking  of  Windows  Media  Player.       Thank  you,  that's  the  one.       You're  welcome.       Yes.       I  do  like  how  it  gets  more  intense,  when  the  music  gets  more  intense  and  it  sort  of  simmer   downs  a  bit  when  it  is  getting  calmer  and  more  relaxed.    That  kind  of  thing.    I  like  that  about   it.    I  like  the  way  it's  reflecting  the  mood.    I  like  the  way  it's  reflecting  the  intensity  of  the   music,  the  speed  of  the  music--the  pace.    I  do  find  if  sometimes  I  just  sit  and  listen  to  the   music  and  if  I  watch  that--again  I  don't  always  like  what  they  do  with  it--it  does  sort   of...These  are  all  kind  of  interesting  questions  that  I  have  never  consciously  thought  of.    It's   kind  of  neat  to  think  about  them.    I  think  it  does  kind  of  enrich  my  experience  of  listening  to   the  music.    Yeah,  that  is  all  I  can  think  of.       OK.   So  what  I  am  going  to  show  you  now  is  I  am  going  to  show  you  the  videos.    So  these  are  videos   of  music  visualizations.    Now  these  visualizations  have  been  developed  at  Ryerson  and   elsewhere,  OK?   OK.

So  they're  not  necessarily  made  by  me.    The  other  thing  is  they  are  not  necessarily  developed   specifically  with  hearing  loss  in  mind.       OK.       OK   Some  are  just  random  visualizations.    There  will  not  be  any  sounds.    If  you're  wondering  why   you're  not  hearing  sound,  it  is  because  I  am  not  playing  sound.    What  I'm  going  to  ask  you  to   do  as  well,  while  watching  these  videos,  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  keep  in  mind  how  you  would   interpret  what  it  is  you  are  watching?  And,  you  know,  what  you  get  from  it?    OK?   OK.       So  this  is  the  first  one.       I  have  one  other  thought  about  what  enhances  my  enjoyment  of  music.       I  am  sorry?   Can  I  back  up  for  a  sec?   Sure.   One  other  thing  is  I  don't  generally  watch  music  videos.    I  guess  I  am  just  the  wrong   generation.    Although  I  still  like  Rock  `n  Roll,  so  who  knows.    But  you  know  the  theatrics   and  the  extremity  of  some  them,  I  just  really  don't  enjoy.    But  I  love  going  to  live  music.    I   am  not  even  a  big  fan  of  someone  necessarily,  but  I  just  love  being  at  a  live  performance.    So   something  that  would  be  showing  me  the  performer,  performing  that  music  that  would   really  enhance  my  enjoyment  too.       Really?   Yup.   OK.   Do  you  go  to  concerts  a  lot?   Well  I  live  two  hours  away  from  Sudbury  and  I  am  self-employed  on  a  limited  income,  so   the  short  answer  is  no.    I'd  go  to  more  if  I  could.       But  you  find  that  with  your  hearing,  do  you  find  that  you  are  able  to  get  more  when  you  are  at   a  concert...     Absolutely.   Compared  to  a  stereo  or  whatever?

Absolutely.       What  kind  of  "that"  do  you  get?   Well,  I  think  it's  partly  the  actual  physical  vibration  of  actually  being,  especially  if  it's  at  a   smaller  place--there  are  some  smaller  concert  venues,  which  are  just  fantastic.    I  can  feel  it.     I  can  feel  the  bass.       The  building  literally  rocks     Yeah.   Whether  its  blues  or  you  know,  folk  or  whatever  it  is,  it's  really,  really  great.       I  also  just  love  the  energy  of  the  people,  the  performers  themselves.    Like  last  night,   Jennifer  Rowland's,  I  am  not  a  big  Rita  MacNeil  fan,  but  I  still  enjoyed  the  whole  experience   of  watching  the  band  interact  with  one  another  and  the  kibitzing  and  the...You  know  all   that  part  that  allows  me  to  enter  into  their  experience  of  performing...doing  what  they  love   to  do.    That's  a  big  thing  for  me.    It  really  enhances  my  enjoyment,  even  if  I  missed  a  lot  of   the  words  and  the  typist  wasn't  always  accurate.    It  looks  great.    It  definitely  helped.    But   just  being  a  part  of  it...I  always  enjoy  that.       OK.   So  this  is  the  first  video.   OK.   (RADAR  STARTS)   This  reminds  me  of  the  old  TV  signal  from  when  I  was  a  kid.       Hmm?   This  reminds  me  of  the  old  TV  signal  from  when  I  was  a  kid.       You  are  not  the  first  person  to  say  that.       Really,  eh?   Do  you  want  me  commenting  as  I  watch  or  just  when  I  am  done?   (RADAR  ENDS)   As  you  were  watching  that  what  did  you  think?    Did  it  say  anything  to  you?   It  felt  like  music.    That  was  my  overriding  feeling.    It  was  really  kind  of  neat.    Once  the   shafts  of  colour,  and  it  reminded  me  of  the  early  TV  signals,  after  I  got  past  that  thought,  I   was  liking  the  rhythm...the  feeling  of  it  being  a  happy,  bouncy...it  felt  like  music.    It  felt  like

a  happy,  bouncy  song.    I  kind  of  thought  of  Jennifer  Rowland's  actually...that  kind  of  you   know  lively,  really  lively.    So  then  when  circles  came  in  that  was  like  another  section  of  the   orchestra  or  the  band  coming  in.    Then  the  other  thing,  I  forgot  even  what  it  was  already,   the  part  that  came  into  the  lower  to  quadrants  that  joined  in,  it  was  just  having  another   part  of  the  band,  or  orchestra--now  this  one--or  the  conductor  or  musicians...it  just  felt   like  music.    It  was  really  enjoyable  actually.   Interesting.       What  do  you  think  the  fan  like  blade  things  represented  for  you?   Blasts  of  sounds.    Tones  of  like...Instruments  playing  whatever  they  would  play.    That  is   what  it  felt  like.         What  in  this  video  didn't  work  for  you?    What  was  annoying?   The  first  part  went  on  too  long  of  the  blasts  of  lights,  the  rays  of  lights.    They  went  on  a  bit   too  long.    As  soon  as  those  little  circles  came  in,  that  just  sort  started  to  fill  it  out.    It  was   kind  of  like  the  beginning  of  a  song  that  goes  on  a  bit  too  long.    It  was  sort  of  like  that  kind   of  a  feeling,  "Ok,  Ok,  got  it".       That  was  a  beginning  of  a  song.       Yeah?  Oh  OK.   What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?   They  were  fine.    I  had  no  negative  reaction  to  them.       Did  the  colour  mean  anything  for  you?    Any  of  the  colouring  mean  anything  to  you?       There  was  the  red  and  the  bright  orange  that  was  repeating  in  the  slices.    That  felt  high   energy  to  me.    One  of  the  circles  I  think  was  blue  or  was  blue  part  of  the  time  or   something...  the  fact  they  were  circles  brought  a  depth  and  richness  to  it  that  was  kind  of  a   relief  from  all  the  blasts  of  (makes  blasting  sound)  and  kind  of  balanced  it.    I  feel  a  little.     The  colours  worked.    Like  I  say  I  can't  hardly  remember  what  they  were  actually.    I   remember  some  of  them  being  white,  some  of  them  being  a  variety  of  colours.    I  know  that.       And  that  was  good  because  if  it  had  been  too  much  the  same  colour  it  would  felt  like  a   boring  rhythm.       Did  you  want  any  of  the  colours  to  mean  anything  to  you?   No,  not  particularly,  no.       What  did  you  think  of  the  speed  of  the  visualization?    Was  it  too  fast,  too  slow?

Because  it  just  seemed  to  me  like  a  lively  tune.    It  felt  like  a  lively  tune,  so  I  was  fine  with  it.     But  like  I  said,  I  still  liked  when  the  other  parts  of  the  band  or  the  other  parts  of  the   orchestra  or  conductor  jumped  in.    It  seemed  to  provide  some  depth.    But  the  pace  was  fine.       I  just  thought  it  was  a  fast  song.       So  now  I  am  going  to  show  you  another  visualization.   You  know  one  other  thought.    As  that  was  playing,  and  I  don't  know  if  I  would  of  thought   this  before  this  conference  and  being  part  of  this,  that  felt  like  music  and  I  didn't  care  that   there  wasn't  anything  music,  which  is  kind  of  interesting.       That  is  interesting.       Yeah.   OK,  so  this  is  the  second  visualization.       (MOVING  CIRCLES  STARTS)   (MOVING  CIRCLE  ENDS)   So  did  this  visualization  say  anything  to  you?     Change  in  good  time  and  then  it  got  really  quite  intriguing.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?   Again,  at  first  they  were  all  kind  of  hmmm  boring,  but  the  whole  thing  I  think  worked.    I   think  the  combo  colours  worked  with  the  whole  angles,  and  the  peaks  and  valleys  and  the   spiking  in  the  circles.    I  think  it  worked  with  this.       Did  the  colours  mean  anything  to  you?   Well  they  are  calm  colours  and  then  I  guess  at  a  certain  level  I'd  say  the  piece  was   intriguing  and  the  colours  aren't  intriguing.       Ok.   Interesting,  interesting.    That  is  definitely  the  first  word  that  came  to  mind  and  stayed  with   me  all  the  way  through.    It  reminded  me  of  bicycles  and  medical,  you  know,  tracking   machines...   Yeah.       Which  was  a  bit  odd.       Did  it  make  you  think  of  music  at  all?

At  first  not.    It  just  kind  of  felt  medical  and  scientific  and  cell  biology  or  something.    But   again,  as  the  other  parts  began  to  come  in,  it  again  had  that  same  feeling  of  now  this  section   is  joining  in,  this  section  is  joining  in  and  the  piece  is  getting  more  complex.    So  I  wouldn't   say  I  had  any  strong  like  or  dislike  for  it.    But  it  was  definitely  interesting  and  by  the  end,  I   was  wishing  I  could  hear  the  music...to  see  what  would  go  with  that.             OK.   Or  not  to  make  music  because  I  don't  play  any  instruments.    But  it  was  intriguing,  yeah   intriguing.       Was  there  anything  in  this  visualization  that  you  just  didn't  like?    It  just  didn't  work  for  you?       No,  because  it  changed  soon  enough.    I  was  just  thinking  same  kind  of  thing  as  the  other   one,  "I  hope  this  doesn't  go  on  too  long,  I  am  bored",  for  the  first  few  seconds,  but  it  did.  But   the  fact  they  were  put  together  made  the  whole  thing  more  intriguing.   OK   I  think  the  colours  ended  up  sort  of  adding  because  they  are  soft.    The  rest  is,  except  for  the   little  circles  of  course,  all  so  angular  and  sort  of  mechanical  looking  and  the  softness  of  the   colour  there  was  sort  of  a  sense  of  a  balance  there.       What  about  the  speed  of  the  visualization?    Did  you  find  it  too  fast,  too  slow?   No,  actually  I  liked  it.       So  this  is  the  last  of  the  visualizations  that  I  am  going  to  show  you?   (BARS  STARTS)   (BARS  ENDS)   So  what  did  you  think?   Interesting.      I  liked  that  one.         Did  that  say  anything  to  you?   Well,  cityscape  was  the  first  thing,  nighttime  cityscape,  visually,  was  the  first  thing  that   popped  into  my  mind.    The  second  thing,  quickly,  was  my  ex-husband  was  a  roadie  and  it   reminded  me  of  some  of  the  soundboards  and  stuff  (laughs).    The  colours  were  great.    I   liked  the  hot  colours.    It  worked  really  well  I  thought.    It  had  a  lot  of  energy  I  thought.    It   reminded  me  of  Rock  `n  Roll.    That's  what  it  made  me  think  of.    It  varied  enough  that  as  I  got   used  to  kind  of  looking  at  it.    I  began  understanding  the  pattern,  or  not  pattern,  but  how  it   was  working,  so  I  started  trying  to  anticipate  where  it  might  spike  up  higher,  which  was   kind  of  fun.    I  don't  know  if  I  want  to  watch  that  for  a  very  long  time.    It'd  get  kind  of  boring.

Did  it  say  anything  to  you  in  terms  of  music?   Rock  `n  Roll  or  something  like  that.       OK   But  I  think  that  is  partly  combined  with  colours  as  well.    The  fire-y  colours...     Yeah.     Definitely  really  worked  with  the  spiking  kind  of  pattern.    And  also  the  fact  it  looks  like  a   nighttime  cityscape  just  seemed  like  it  could  be  that  or  maybe  jazz.   OK.   Was  there  anything  about  this  visualization  that  just  didn't  work  for  you?   No,  I  liked  it.    I  thought  it  was  really  interesting.    I  liked  the  layers,  the  foreground  or   background  kind  of  thing,  the  twinkling  stars  or  whatever  they  are  supposed  to  be.       Pardon?   The  twinkling  stars  or  whatever  they  are  supposed  to  be  was  neat,  yeah   What  did  you  think  of  the  speed?  Was  it  too  fast,  too  slow?   It  worked  for  this,  I  think.    It  worked  well  with...again,  what  it  made  me  think  of  was  a  very   good  jazzy  beat  or  Rock  `n  Roll  or  something  that  has  a  lot  of  energy.    Has  a  fire-y  kind  of   feeling  to  it  and  unexpected  parts  like  jazz  has.    So  I  think  the  visuals,  and  the  patterns,  the   colours  and  tempo  and  everything  I  think  worked  really  well.       What  I  am  going  to  do  now  is  give  you  this  questionnaire,  you'll  see  each  of  these  visualization   types  is  given  on  here  and  I  am  just  going  to  go  and  grab  my  next  person  and  leave  you  to  fill   it  out.    You  can  use  X's,  checkmarks,  in  here  and  whatever  it  is,  what  you  want  to  say,   comments,  whatever.

Briefly,  what  I  am  going  to  do  today  is  I  am  going  to  ask  you  a  series  of  questions  about   yourself  and  about  your  experiences  with  music,  OK?   OK.       Then  I  am  going  to  show  you  a  few  short  videos.    After  each  video,  I  am  going  to  ask  you  a  few   questions  about  the  video--what  you  thought.       Alright.       And  then  after  the  last  video,  I  will  give  you  a  quick  wrap  up  questionnaire...       Alright.       ...just  to  close  it  all  up.       First  of  all,  to  start,  do  you  identify  yourself  as  deaf,  hard  of  hearing,  hearing,  nothing  at  all?     How  do  you  label  yourself?       Hard  of  hearing.       And  if  you  don't  mind  my  asking,  about  how  old  are  you?   I  will  be  69  this  week.       So  65  plus.       Were  you  born  hard  of  hearing  or...?   No,  I  started  losing  my  hearing  10  years  ago.       OK.   And  it's  8  years,  no,  7  years  since  I  got  my  first  hearing  aid  and  5  since  I  got  the  second.       So  you  wear  2  hearing  aids?       2  hearing  aids.       OK.       I  have  moderate  to  severe  hearing  loss.    I  am  at  the  60  line  with  one  ear  and  the  70  line   with  the  other.    And  I  have  the  hearing  loss  of  Meniere's  disease,  not  the  more  traditional   hearing  loss  where  the  higher  tones  are  lost.    So  I  have  lost--we  were  talking  about   music--I  have  lost  the  bass  tones.    So  I  can  hear  extremely  high  tones  somewhat  over  the   normal  speaking  voice.      I  hear  birds  very  well,  violins...         A  lot  people  actually  think  hearing  birds  is  a  bad  part  of  the  deal,  but  anyway.

Do  you  remember...you  were  saying  you  lost  your  hearing  about  10  years  ago?       Started  to.       Started  to.    Is  it  progressive?    Are  you  continuing  to  lose  hearing?   It's  been  two  years  since  I  had  a  hearing  test,  but  it's  been  pretty  consistent  over  that  time   frame--those  7,  8  years.       Did  you  notice  your  hearing  loss  before  that  10  year  point?       No,  it  was  just  very  gradual.    Like  when  you  get  to  40  and  you  start  needing  glasses--it  was   a  bit  like  that.    Just  a  little  bit,  then  a  little  bit  more.       I  have  worn  these  since  I  was  12  (touches  glasses),  but  OK.         (laughs)   So  then  you  have  a  lot  of  memories  of  music  from  before  10  years  ago?       Definitely.    Definitely,  yeah.       Do  you  have  a  music  collection  of  some  sort?    A  CD  collection,  record,  albums,  anything  like   that?   Yeah,  we  have  a  pretty  extensive  CD  collection.  Being  Manitoban,  we  don't  have  access  to  a   lot  of  places  to  go  out  for  music.    So  we  do  have  quite  a  bit  and  a  very  good  stereo  system  at   home.       So,  if  you  think  about  the  stuff  you  had  before  you  lost  your  hearing  and  when  you  play  it   today,  do  you  notice  any  difference  between  what  you  use  to  hear  and  what  you  hear  now,   when  you  listen  to  that  piece?       Major  difference.       What  are  the  things  that  you  really  notice?   I  have  started  an  initial  progression.    At  first  what  I  notice  is  if  I  would  be  at  a  restaurant   and  there  would  be  music  playing,  it  would  sound  to  me  like  two  different  systems  were   playing  and  one  was  playing  at  a  different  speed  than  the  other.       Interesting.       Yeah,  just  not  very  pleasant,  you  know?   Right.       And  then  it  gradually  got  to  where  other  people  might  find  music  annoying  and  I  didn't   even  know  any  music  was  playing,  you  know?

OK.       So  again  that  loss  on  the  low  end,  right?      Coming  back...   Yeah.       Yeah.       So,  are  you  going  to  skip  on?    Do  I  need  to  go  ahead  to  where  I  am  now  or  are  you  going  to   ask  that?   Go  right  ahead.    I  probably  will.       Alright.       The  more  you  tell  me,  the  less  I  need  to  ask.   So  where  I  am  now...Let's  see,  it's  three  years  since  we  bought  our  current  stereo  system.     And  we  went  out  and  looked  at  a  high  end  system  and  very,  very  good  speakers.    We  tried   lots  of  speakers  and  my  husband  was  very  happy  to  buy  whichever  set  of  speakers  I  could   hear  best  with.       Right.       And  we  did  that  because  he  really  enjoys  music.    I  hardly  listen  to  it  all  now  because...You   know,  I  have  only  learned  part  of  what  is  happening  this  time  at  this  conference:  With   digital  hearing  aids,  I  already  hear  high  tones  well  but  I  think  my  hearing  aids  are  dumbing   out  the  part  that  I  hear  and  I  am  not  hearing...even  with  my  hearing  aids,  I  am  not  hearing   the  bass  parts  well,  so.    The  music  I  use  to  recognize,  I  just  don't  recognize  any  longer.           Did  you  use  to  be  a  very  avid  listener  of  music  before?   Avid?    I  wouldn't  say  avid,  probably  pretty  average.       So  you  have  noticed  a  drop  in  wanting  to  listen  to  music?   I  hardly  ever  turn  it  on  anymore.       OK.       And  when  you  do  listen  to  music,  do  you  wear  your  hearing  aids?   I  wear  my  hearing  aids,  if  my  husband  is  there  and  we  are  listening  to  music  together  and   then  I  just  try  to  sort  of  ignore  it.    The  only  time  I  hear  something  that  is  sort  of  for  my  own   pleasure  is...what  I  do  is  I  might  be  ironing  or  something  and  I  take  my  hearing  aids  out  and   I  put  stereo  up  really  loud.    And  then,  I  mean  my  husband  can't  stand  that,  but  at  least  I   have  some  semblance  of  what  music  use  to  sound  like.

So  pumping  up  the  volume  does  seem  to  help  a  little?       It  helps  some,  yeah.    And  I  fiddle  around  with  the  knobs  a  bit.         You  play  with  the  equalizer  and  stuff?   Yeah,  and  then  I  always  need  to  remember  to  turn  the  volume  back  down.       Do  you  think  that  the  music  you  tend  to  want  to  listen  to  today  is  influenced  by  your  hearing,   by  what  you  can  hear  today?   Music  that  I  want  to  hear?    No,  I  don't  think  so.       Your  music  choices...you  don't  think  your  music  choices  or  music  preferences  right  now  are   influenced  or  shaped  by  what  you  can  hear?       No,  I  still  listen  to  what  I  like  and  often  is  what  I  do  listen  to  are  groups  that  I  have  gone  to   see  in  person  because  usually  if  I  go  to  a  live  concert,  if  it  is  a  small  venue,  I  feel  like  I  have  a   satisfactory  experience  listening  to  music.    It  doesn't  happen  very  often  in  Manitoba,  but   once  in  a  while...there  is  a  venue  where  once  a  month  or  so  during  the  winter  a  good  small   combo  might  come  on  in--somebody  like  Rick  Fines  or  Suzie  Vinnick  or  someone  like  that.     And  its  small  enough  and  the  acoustics  are  good  enough  that  I  actually  have  a  good   experience  there.    And  I  try  to  listen...we  buy  the  CDs  and  take  them  home  or  our  kids  give   us  music  and  their  choice  is  pretty  good;  they  kind  of  know  what  I'd  like--stuff  like  Michael   Buble.           Right.       It's  always  just  current  stuff  that  I  listen  to,  you  know?  I  am  not  a  Classical  person.       Right.       So  then  the  concert  experience,  it's  much  more  enjoyable  to  you,  than  before  the  music?    Is   that  what  you  are  basically  saying?      That  you  get  more  out  of  the  concert  experience?     Sorry,  I  am  going  to  have  to  ask  you  to  repeat  that?   Do  you  feel  that  you  get  more  out  of  the  concert  experience  then  recorded  music?       Definitely,  definitely,  yeah.    As  long  as  it's  not  the  really  heavy  "boom,  boom"  type  of  music.     I  can't  go  there.    Even  last  night  at  the  concert,  I  took  my  hearing  aids  out  and  I  could  have  a   pretty  good  experience  last  night.    It  was  excellent  when  Jennifer  played  the  first  time.    And   when  the  choir  was  here...I  have  really  been  happy  with  sound  systems  and  how  they  seem   to  work  with  my  hearing  aids--here  in  the  building  especially.       Ah,  OK.       How  about  you?  Been  talking  about  me.

It's  fine.       So  you've  been  talking  about  how  you  guys  bought  a  specialized  home  stereo  for...   We  tried  to  buy  one  to  suit  my  hearing  ability.       Right,  to  suit  you.    Do  you  use  anything  else?    Do  you  try  and  listen  to  the  radio?    Do  you  try   iPods--anything  like  that?       (Shakes  head  indicating  no)   Have  you  tried  music  videos--anything  like  that?       No,  no.    I  don't  tend  to  listen  to  music,  unless  I  am  ironing.    The  only  the  other  time  I  have  it   on  is  when  I  just  want  to  sit  down  and  listen  to  it.       Right.       That  is  a  relaxing  thing  my  husband  and  I  will  do  during  an  evening.    I  don't  tend  to  have   it...I  think  I  found  out  when  I  was  relatively  young--I  was  a  nurse  living  in  an  apartment   with  some  coworkers--and  if  the  radio  was  on  all  day,  the  stereo  or  the  TV,  I  had  a  much   higher  stress  level,  than  if  I  just  had  it  quiet.    So  that's  my  reason  for  not  listening  to  music  a   lot.       So  then  what  specific  frustrations  do  you  have  when  you  try  and  listen  to  music?       The  distortion.       The  distortion?   It's  really  distorted  and  there  isn't  a  proper  balance  between  what  should  be  the  bass  and   what  should  be  the  high  tones.    It  just  all  kind  of  gets  garbled  in  there.    It's  just  not   enjoyable.           The...   Somebody  hit  it  on  the  head  at  one  of  the  sessions  here  that  hearing  aids  are  meant  for   speech  and  they  don't  work  well  with  music.    I  guess  that's  what  I've  been  struggling  with   and  not  really  realizing  the  difference.    It  was  happening  to  me,  but  I  guess  I  wasn't  really   putting  the  blame  in  the  right  place.       If  you  wanted  to  use  some  piece  of  technology,  like  a  computer  or  something  or  some  other   technology,  to  help  you  better  understand  music,  what  would  be  the  most  important  pieces  of   information  that  you  would  really  want  the  technology  to  be  showing  you  or  to  be  giving  you   from  the  music?   The  most  important  pieces  of  information  that  I  would  want  to  know  about  the  technology?

Oh,  music  visualizations,  OK.       It's  software  that  tries  to  show  music  in  a  visual  way.       OK.       OK.   Is  it  something  like...it  was  a  revelation  for  me  to  feel  the  music  in  the  balloon.    So  doing   something  like  that  visually?   Yeah.       OK.       So  now,  the  software  I  am  going  to  show  you,  the  videos  I  am  going  to  show  you,  they  are  not   all  from  Ryerson,  OK?    They  were  developed  all  over  the  place.       OK.       They  are  not  necessarily  designed  for  a  deaf  or  hard  of  hearing  person  to  watch,  OK?     (agrees)   I  will  not  be  playing  sound;  so  you  will  not  be  hearing  any  sound.       Alright.       And  as  you  are  watching  the  videos,  what  I  am  going  to  ask  you  to  do  is  sort  of  keep  in  the   back  of  your  mind,  how  you  would  interpret  what  you  are  watching?   OK.       OK.       This  is  probably  something  that  is  easier  for  younger  people  to  do   You  might  be  surprised  actually.    You  might  be  pleasantly  surprised.       So  here  is  the  first  video.     (BARS  STARTS)   (BARS  ENDS)   Seems  to  me  it's  a  symphony.      But  also  what  I  found  myself  doing  when  I  first  started   watching  that  was  the  fact...I  have  tinnitus  and  part  of  it  for  music,  not  specific  songs  per   se...kind  of  a  musical  non-stop  thing.    Which  I  found  was  some  of  the  peaks  were  fitting   with  some  of  the  rhythms  I  hear  in  my  head.

Interesting.    That's  interesting.     When  it  became  more  of  a  crescendo  at  the  end  then  it  was  getting  out  of  my  tinnitus   rhythm...spiking  more  than  it  was...   Interesting.       If  you  don't  have  it...maybe  I  am  not  explaining  it  well.           Did  this  look  like  music  to  you?   Yeah,  it  looked  like  a  symphony.       Was  there  any  part  of  this  video  that  you  found  confusing;  that  you  just  didn't  understand?     No,  it  was  kind  of  mesmerizing.       Interesting,  OK.       It's  a  bit  like  watching,  something  we  took  our  kids  to  a  long,  long  time  ago--Laser  light   show,          Dark  Side  of  the  Moon.    We  took  our  kids  to  when  they  were  teens.       What  did  you  think  of  the  colours?   I  like  that  colour  combination.    To  me,  it's  a  very  relaxing  nighttime  sky  and  the  shapes  are   high  rises  and  the  nice  cheerful  colours,  the  young  lights,  it's  nice...the  city  sky  line.       Do  you  think  the  colours  meant  anything?   Yeah,  they  were.    Well  I  was  hearing  the  movement  of  the  colours  as  the  kind  of  music  that  I   always,  always  have.       Did  you  find  this  video  too  slow  or  too  fast?    What  did  you  think  of  the  speed  of  the  video?       It  was  kind  of  faster  at  the  end;  that's  probably  when  it  wasn't  too  fitting  with  what  I  hear.     Tinnitus  adds  a  special  dimension  to  what  you  hear.       I  know.    I  have  it  too.       It's  fun  isn't.    I  sometimes  learn  that  I  change  the  tune.       I  learned  that  sometimes  that  you  can  change  the  channel,  you  what  I  mean?   Yes.       But  it  takes  it  a  bit.    I  also  find  for  me  that  tinnitus  kicks  in  more  when  I  am  tired.       More?   When  I  am  tired.

When  I  am  not  feeling  all  that  up  and  energetic?   Yeah.       My  favorite  one  is  the  sticks  and  triangle  orchestra  down  the  hall.       That  will  do  it.   And  my  husband  whistles  allot  and  when  I  pick  that  up...   Did  your  husband  come  to  the  conference?   No,  I  wish  he  had.    I  truly  wish  he  had.       There  was  a  talk  on  the  spouse  experience.       I  was  there  because  I  was  wanting  to  hear  what  he  would  be  experiencing,  but  there  were   very  few  spouses  there  and  I  really  wish  he  had  been  there.    He  is  a  patient  and  loving  guy.       The  last  time  I  went  to  a  conference  I  brought  my  wife  and  I  said  the  reason  I  am  bringing  you   is  because  you  are  going  to  go  to  this  talk  about  spouses.       Right.       And  she  wasn't  happy  with  me  because  I  said  this  is  why  I  am  taking  you.    But  at  the  same   time,  for  her  it  was  an  interesting  experience  because  she  got  a  lot  out  of  it.    She  did--she  got   a  lot  out  of  it.       so  I  think  it  helped  her  a  lot  understanding   some  issues.       I  am  thinking  I  might  be  able  to  get  him  to   To  ? Maybe.       Well  if  you  can't  do  ,    Yeah,   .            the  one  after  that  is  Ottawa,  which  might  be  easier.       e?    .

This  is  like  Jennifer  Rowland  in  the  ticks  and  reels.    You  know  it  starts  of  kind  of  slow  and   then  there  is  more  depth  to  it  and  more  speed  to  it  and  just  when  you  think  it  can't  go  any   faster,  she  speeds  it  up  another  bit.    So  I  suppose  I  interpret  that  as  something  like  that.     That  wouldn't  fit  in  with  my  tinnitus  at  all   It  did  not  fit  in  with  your  tinnitus?   Did  watching  that,  did  you  feel  that  you  were  watching  music?       Watching  rhythm.       Watching  rhythm?   Yeah.       When  I  think  about  rhythm,  I  think  about  drums,  but  it  was  more  like  her  quick  violin   moving  around  there,  not  like  drums.         Did  this  video  say  anything  to  you?       No,  no,  I  don't  think  so.         No?   Was  there  anything  about  the  video  that  you  found  confusing  or  frustrating?   No.       No.       What  did  you  think  of  the  things  moving  up  and  down  (points  at  screen)?   Well,  first  they  were  getting  me  off  in  another  tangent  because  I  also  quilt  so  I  was  seeing   those  things  as  pieces  of  fabric,  looking  at  the  colours  and  how  they  interacted.      And  that   was  kind  of  neat,  but  then  I  pulled  myself  back,  which  isn't  unpleasant  at  all.       Yeah,  yeah,  I  know.       If  that's  what  you  do.       Right.       What  if  anything,  did  those  shapes  moving  up  and  down  mean  anything  to  you?       No?   I  think  I  was  just  enjoying  them  for  what  they  were.    I  don't  think  I'd  try  and  fit  them  to   anything.

What  about  the  circle?  Did  the  circles  mean  anything  to  you?   Actually,  the  circles  would  have  been  more  like  drumming  now  that  I  think  about  it.    The   fact  that  it  was,  not  round,  not  just  that,  but  the  pulsating  part  of  it  on  a  drum,  kind  of  like  a   heart  actually.       Kind  of  like  what?   Heart.    Now,  the  beat  going  there,  I  mean  heart  as  to...   Did  you  find  that  the  colours  meant  something  to  you?   No  I  was  more  caught  up  in  their  movement.    When  I  was  looking  at  the  colours  I  got  more   distracted  about  fabric  colours,  but  I  was  enjoying  the  movement  of  them.       Did  you  want  the  colours  to  mean  something?   Did  I  want  them  to  be  that  way?   Did  you  want  them  to  mean  something?   At  one  point  I  remember  thinking  this  kind  of  reminds  me  of  a  cartoon.       Right.       Did  you  find  this  video  too  fast  or  did  you  find  it  too  slow?    What  was  the  speed  like?       No,  I  was  enjoying  the  speed.       OK.   No  it  wasn't  neither.    I  just  went  with  what  it  was.    It  didn't  bother  me  either  way.       So  we  will  bring  up  the  last  of  these.    So  this  is  the  last  video.       (MOVING  CIRCLES  STARTS)   Here  we  have  molecules.       This  one  is  like  a  lullaby.       It's  really  quite  mesmerizing  isn't  it?   Pardon?     Nice.   What  did  you  say?   It's  mesmerizing.

(MOVING  CIRCLES  ENDS)     I  felt  it  like  a  lullaby.    I  think  maybe  the  visualization  there  for  me  was  this  is  line  is  sort  of   dividing  the  space  between  sleep  and  awake.    This  being  the  wake  side  and  this  is  gradually   fading  over  there.    It's  kind  of  a  gentle  lyric  maybe...lyrical--gently  lyrical.    It  was  very   relaxing.    Did  you  design  that?    Did  somebody  design  that?       I  can't  tell  you.       Oh  well.   Did  you  find  anything  in  this  that  you  did  not  like?    That  you  perhaps  you  found  confusing  or   frustrating?     No.       No?   Maybe,  the  line  in  the  centre,  maybe  because  I  think  I  was  fitting  the  things  into  what  I   thought  was  a  lullaby.    Maybe  it  was  going  a  little  too  fast.       Going  fast  how?   The  little  box  going  up  and  down.    I  think  if  it  would  just  be  a  little  slower  it  would  fit   my...they  were  doing  their  job.       What  did  you  think  of  the  shapes?   I  like  them.       What  did  the  shapes  say  to  you?   The  shapes  are  busy  to  me.    I  don't  see  them  as  notes  or  anything.    I  guess  if  I  got  analytical   I  might  see  them  as  notes,  but  I  don't  want  to  think  about  it  now.    I  like  the  movement  of   them--gently  going  side  to  side  and  changing  them  with  a  interface.       Does  this  look  like  music  to  you?   Yeah.    Yeah,  it  did--very  gentle  music.       OK.       What  if  anything  did  you  think  about  the  colours?   I  don't  think  I  did.       The  colours,  did  it  mean  anything  to  you?   Actually  were  they  the  same  colours  that  were  in  the  quarter  of  the  circle?

Yeah,  a  little  bit  yeah,  similar.       Nothing  particularly...they  are  colours  I  like  so  I  found  them  very  pleasant.       You  were  commenting  that  you  found  this  stuff  going  on  around  this  middle  line  really  busy.     But  did  you  find  the  video  itself  fast  or  slow?   No,  I  found  it  was  at  a  very  nice  pace  going  across.       OK,  I  guess  what  I  was  thinking  was  the  speed  that  was  going  across  was  a  little  bit  faster   than  the  speed  that  was  going  up  and  down.    So  maybe  there  was  a  little  disharmony  there.       I  see.    I  see  what  you  were  thinking.       And  if  a  song  is  a  fast  song,  what  do  you  think  should  happen  to  the  video?    When  the  song  is  a   fast  song?    When  a  song  is  a  slow  song?    Should  the  video  be  fast  or  slow?       I  think  it  would  speed  up  for  a  fast  song.       So  that  was  the  last  video.    So  what  I  am  going  to  do  now  is  ask  you  to  fill  out  a  questionnaire.       So  how  do  you  want  them  rated?   You  can  ...   So  there's  one  of  each?   You  can  mark  it  anyway  you  like,  so  if  you  want  to  add  words,  check  marks,  whatever  go   ahead.

OK,  so  as  I  explained  earlier,  the  procedure  in  this  study  is  that  I  am  going  to  ask  a  few   questions  about  you  and  get  a  sense  of  who  you  are  and  your  experiences  with  respect   to  music  and  that  kind  of  thing.     OK.   And  then  I  am  going  to  show  you  a  few  videos.       OK.   At  the  end  of  each  video  I  am  going  to  ask  you  some  questions.       OK.   At  the  end  of  all  the  videos  I  am  going  to  give  you  a  bit  of  a  wrap  up  questionnaire...     OK.   ...and  that  will  basically  be  the  end  of  the  study.         OK.   So  hopefully  we  should  be  done  in  about  a  half  an  hour  or  so.       Sounds  good.       So  to  start,  do  you  identify  yourself  as  hard  of  hearing,  deaf,  deafened?     I  identify  as  hard  of  hearing.       And  about  how  old  are  you?   I  am  26.       So  if  you  could  just  tell  me  a  little  about  yourself.    Were  you  born  hard  of  hearing  or...?       Yes,  I  was  born  with  bilateral  hearing  loss  with  poor  speech  discrimination.    I  wasn't   diagnosed  until  I  was  four  at  which  point  I  was  outfitted  with  binaural  hearing  aids   and  I  wore  those  until  Grade  9  unwillingly.    I  chose  to  stop  wearing  hearing  aids   through  my  high  school  and  early  University.    And  then  in  the  third  year  of  my   undergrad,  my  first  undergrad,  I  got  new  digital  hearing  aids  and  I  have  sort  of  been   working  with  that  now  and  I  am  about  to  buy  a  second  pair.    And  that's  where  I  am   at.       Do  you  remember  much  of  what  it  is  was  like  to  hear  music  with  the  hearing  aids  you   had  in  Grade  8?

I  didn't  wear  them  to  listen  to  music.    I  would  frequently...Concerts  are  too  loud  to   wear  hearing  aids.       Yeah,  of  course.       For  my  own  personal  music  experience  I  would  usually  wear  headphones.       And  so  you  still  wear  headphones  usually?       I  do  wear  headphones.    Not  to  say  I  don't  ever  listen  to  music  without  headphones   because  there's  social  situations.    I  listen  to  the  radio  in  the  car...that's  fine.    I  usually   prefer  familiar  music.    When  it  comes  to  music  with  lyrics  and  I  can't  understand  the   lyrics,  I  have  less  interest  in  the  song,  so  it  depends.    I  started  listening  to  much   more  purely  instrumental  music  to  avoid  that.           So  your  hearing  loss  in  some  way  has  shaped  the  decisions  you  make  when  you  buy   music  or  when  you  go  out  and  pursue?   Yes,  I  tend  to  choose  music  with  lyrics  that  either  I  am  familiar  with  or  I  can  easily   become  familiar  with  or  I  choose  music  with  no  lyrics  at  all.       Something  very  clear  or  nothing...No?   Depends  on  the  style  of  music.    I  listen  to  a  lot  of  psychedelic  trance  and  I  wouldn't   call  that  clear,  but  there  is  no  lyrics,  so...     Interesting.    OK.       You  were  saying  you  use  the  radio  in  your  car,  right?   (agrees)   Do  you  have  an  iPod,  home  stereo  or  anything  like  that?   I  use  an  iPhone.       OK.   And  you  use  headphones  with  your  Ipod  or...?   Yup.       Do  you  use  any  strategies  or  any  particular  tricks  to  help  you  enjoy  music  more?       When  it  comes  to  music  with  lyrics,  I  will  often  download  an  entire  album,  look  up   all  the  lyrics,  learn  them,  and  this  allows  me  to  actually  hear  the  song  better  when  I   am  listening  to  them.    The  same  thing  goes  for  when,  for  example,  last  night  we  were

in  the  bar  and  there  was  music  playing  and  it  sounded  sort  of  familiar  and  I  saw   someone  else  singing  along  to  it  and  by  reading  the  lips  I  realized  it  was   "Wonderwall"  by  Oasis,  which  is  a  song  I  actually  know  very  well.    And  once  I  knew   what  song  it  was,  I  could  hear  the  song  better.    So  I  think  it's  memory,  right?  Of  the   music  allows  me  to  actually  hear  the  song  better,  which  allows  me  to  enjoy  the   music  much  better  at  that  point.    It  stopped  being  words  and  started  being  started   being  a  song.             Interesting.       This  is  going  to  sound  a  little  odd,  but  when  you  listen  to  music,  are  you  able  to  hear   the  melody  and  the  different  instruments  or...Tell  me  a  little  bit  about  what  you  think   you  hear  when  you  listen  to  music.     I  can  distinguish  between  certain  instruments.    I  was  having  this  conversation  last   night  at  the  Rita  MacNeil  concert.    Somebody  asked  me  if  I  could  hear  the  symbols.     And  I  could  hear  the  symbols,  but  I  don't  consciously  hear  them.    I  need  to  focus  on  a   particular  sound  to  hear  it,  otherwise  I  get  the  overall  effect.    If  I  am  concentrating,  I   hear  it  better.    Background  music  doesn't  really  do  it  for  me,  so  I  have  to  be  paying   attention  to  the  music  to  enjoy  it.       And  you  were  saying  that  through  high  school  and  the  beginning  of  University,  you  did   not  tend  to  wear  hearing  aids.    You  are  wearing  digital  aids  now.    Do  you  wear   digitally  aids  normally  when  you  listen  to  music  now?       No.   You  don't  want  to  wear  them  at  all.   I  don't  wear  them  as  much  as  I  should  to  begin  with.    I  find  that  with  the  hearing  aids   on  I  am  hearing  things  that  are  actually  distracting  me  from  the  music.    I  guess  I  am   not  comfortable  yet  with  the  high  frequencies.    I  will  often  hear  things  that  sound   like  birds  chirping,  even  though  I  am  sure  that  it  just  part  of  the  music.  But  it  is   distracting  me  a  lot  from  the  song,  so  I  don't  wear  them.       You  were  talking  about  how  you  will  listen  to  music  in  your  and  you  talked  little  bit   about  going  to  concerts.    Do  you  go  to  concerts  fairly  frequently?   I  do.       You  live  in   so...  

I  live  in  Ottawa  during  the  school  year,  so  yes.

Yeah,  so  it  makes  it  easier.         Do  you  have  your  own  apartment?       Yes.       When  you  are  at  home,  when  you  are  at  your  parent's  home,  do  you  find  that  you  have   to  go  to  a  quiet  space  or  something  to  listen  to  music?  Do  you...   My  house  is  a  quiet  space.       Right,  so  I  see.       So  no,  that  is  a  quiet  place.       OK.       So  let's  see.    When  you  are  trying  to  listen  to  music,  what  do  you  find  particularly   frustrating?       If  I  am  focusing  on  the  music,  it  is  frustrating  trying  to  hear  the  music  over  other   sounds.    So  at  a  party,  if  there  is  a  good  song  on  and  I  want  to  listen  to  the  song  and   everyone  is  talking  at  that  the  party,  then  I  can't  pay  attention  to  the  song.    But  I   don't  really  think  that  is  what  you  are  asking.    What  do  I  find  frustrating?    Really,  it's   just  understanding  lyrics;  It's  understanding  what  is  being  sung.    I  like  to  sing;  not   that  I  do  it  particularly  well.    But  it's  part  of  the  enjoyment  of  listening  to  music--the   ability  to  participate  in  that.    And  my  inability  to  participate  in  that,  I  find   frustrating.               Ah,  interesting.       Other  than  lyrics,  is  there  anything  else  that  you  find  particularly  frustrating?       Often  when  there  is  maybe  a  specific  instrument  being  played.    As  you  said  earlier   can  you  distinguish  between  different  instruments?       Right.       And  there  are  some  styles  of  music  where  they  have  a  flute,  for  example  or  an   instrument  in  a  higher  frequency  and  I  can't  really  hear  that.    And  I  miss  the  bulk  of   what's  really  good  about  that  song.    And  that  can  be  frustrating  because  you  can  go   like  "you're  missing  it?"  and  you  see  it,  but  you  can't  hear  it.    And  that  can  be  a  little   bit  frustrating,  but  I  guess  I  have  compensated  by  just  choosing  to  not  listen  to  that   kind  of  music  to  begin  with,  so  I  don't  really  feel  like  I  am  at  a  loss.

When  you  say  you  can  see  it,  like  when  you  are  at  a  concert?   Yeah.    I  frequently  watch  music  videos  or  concert  videos.    I  actually  prefer  that  to   just  listening  to  an  album.    But  I  think  that  is  the  student  life--you  are  always  on   YouTube.       Well,  yeah,  yes  and  no.       In  terms  of  music  videos,  or  videoing  in  general,  do  you  tend  to  watch  captioned  videos   or  not?    Do  you...   Captions?   Yeah.       YouTube  doesn't  really  have  that  available.       Yeah,  I  know.       I  don't  have  cable  and  I  don't  really  watch...I  don't  really  listen  to  mainstream  music,   so  Much  Music  doesn't  really  do  it  for  me.    And  the  captioning  on  Much  Music  is  not   good.       No.   It's  like  the  News.       I  know.       It  doesn't  really  help,  when  your  trying  to  be  in  pace  with  music--so  no,  in  that   context.    However,  I  do  really  enjoy  buying  movies  of  music.    So  the  "Last  Waltz"  or   Pink  Floyd's  "The  Wall"  and  that  has  really  good  subtitles.    And  I  will  always  have   the  subtitles  on  when  I  am  watching  those.       So  this  is  going  to  be  a  weird  question,  but  if  you  had  access  to  a  computer  or  some   other  kind  of  technology  that  had  the  job  of  supporting  you  or  your  enjoyment  of   music,  what  things,  what  information,  would  you  want  that  technology  to  give  you?       What  would  be  the  important  stuff  you  would  really  want  to  know?   I  would  like  to  know  all  about  the  music,  the  band  and  all  the  background.    Often  if  I   find  a  new  band  that  I  like  I  will  Wikipedia  them  to  death  and  learn  more  about   them.    It's  just  part  of  enjoying  the  music  scene  and  learning  about  it.    It  would  be   great  if...You  know  how  some  modern  car  radios...they  have  that  rolling  screen  that   says  the  song  name,  the  artist  name  and  the...and  if  they  could  continue  that  also

give  you  lyrics  and  what  instrument  is  being  played  and  just  having  a  rolling  set  of   information  that  would  be  really  good.    I  am  skeptical  about  something  like  a   computer.    The  reason  I  got  my  iPhone  was  because  I  could  consolidate  all  the  crap  I   had,  right?    So  there,  if  there  is  an  application  on  the  iPhone  that  could  recognize   what  song  is  being  played  and  stream  that  information  for  you,  that's  cool.    But  I   would  never  carry  something  outside  of  that  because  the  whole  point  of  me  getting   the  consolidated  piece  of  technology  is  to  not  have  to  have  all  this  stuff  to  enjoy  my   music.       There's  actually  an  application  for  Mac--I  don't  know  if  it's  on  the  iPhone--where  it   takes  a  sampling  of  the  song  that  you  are  hearing,  like  it  will  literally  take  a  sampling   off  the  radio,  and  it  will  go  to  the  Internet  and  grab  a  compressed  sample  of  an   equivalence  to  that  and  then  suddenly  boom,  this  is  what  you  are  hearing.       It  has  all  the  information?   Yeah.       When  I  load  a  new  album  on  to  iTunes,  it  can  actually  get  all  the  album  information.     And  I  do  like  that  feature,  but  I  want  something  you  can  take  with  you.       No.   I  just  don't  sit  at  home  and  listen  to  music;  that's  not  what  I  do.    I  don't  sit  at  home  to   do  anything  really.       Do  you  try  and  avoid  staying  at  home?   I  am  sorry?   Do  you  try  and  avoid  staying  at  home?    Is  what  you're  saying?   I  don't  avoid  staying  at  home.    I  like  being  at  home.    If  I  am  not  home  and  I  am   listening  to  music,  I  am  studying  at  which  point  I  am  listening  to  classical  because  it   doesn't  distract  me  from  my  work,  right?    So  I  am  not  listening  to  the  music,  it's  just   on  and  I  am  working.       So  you  listen  to  music  help  you  focus  as  well  as  entertain  you?       Yeah.       Yeah.    OK.         Or  I  will  have  the  TV  playing  a  movie  that  I  am  familiar  with  so  that  I  am  not  feeling   the  need  to  watch  it.    But  I  like  background  noise  when  I  study,  yeah.

OK.       And  another  problem  is  with  technology  is  that  I  recently  rediscovered  that...I   recently  rediscovered  vinyl  and  vinyl  sounds  much  better  than  CDs,  tapes,  MP3's.     The  sound  quality  is  extremely  layered...   Yeah,  it  is.       ...and  rich.       I  mean  they  have  modern  record  players  these  days,  but  I  am  not  going  to  go  and   buy  a  new  record  player.    I  have  my  dad's  old  record  player.    It  works  fine.    I  don't   have  the  motivation  to  buy  supplemental  technology  for  vinyl.       Right.       Right.       So  there's  that  as  well.    But  I  mean  you  can  reintroduce  vinyl.    It's  still  good.       No  I  agree  with  you.    I  grew  up  on  vinyl.    I  am  old  enough  to  say  I  grew  up  on  vinyl.    I   actually  own  albums.    I  actually  bought  albums.       I  still  buy  albums.    Some  of  the  best  rock  bands  that  around  still  release  on  vinyl.       Vinyl,  yeah.       We  go  out  of  our  way  to  buy  vinyl.       Yeah,  and  actually  they  go  out  of  their  way  to  produce  vinyl  because  they  know  that  if   they...   A  better  experience.    And  there  are  actually  people  who  are  Music  aficionados  who   do  know  that,  like  myself  and  my  partner,  and  that  we  seek  of  the  vinyl.    So  they   produce  it  for  us.       So  now  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  show  you  the  videos  at  this  point.       OK.       Now  these  are  short  videos  of  music  visualizations.       I  am  sorry?       These  videos  are  music  visualizations.       OK.

They  are  based  on  software  that  takes  some  piece  of  music,  right,  and  tries  to  present  it   visually.       Like  a  visualizer  on  a  music  program  or  like  sheet  music?   Yeah,  very  similar.    Yeah,  very  similar.       So  the  vibes.       Except  you're  not  going  to  see  Windows  Media  Player  kind  of  thing,  but  it's  very   similar.       So  what  I  am  going  to  show  you...the  videos  I  am  going  to  show  you  are  not  necessarily   tools  that  were  developed  at  Ryerson.    They've  been  developed  by  various  people.       They're  just  videos  that  you  have?     That's  right.       The  other  thing  is  they  are  not  necessarily  designed  for  people  that  are  deaf  or  hard  of   hearing.    They  are  not  necessarily  designed  to  support  people  that  are  deaf  or  hard  of   hearing.       OK.       Also,  as  I  play  it,  you're  not  going  to  hear  anything.    I  won't  play  the  sound.       So  you  want  me  to  give  you  my  impression  of  what  it  should  sound  like?   No,  no.   So  as  you're...the  reason  I  am  telling  you  that  I  am  not  going  to  play  the  sound  because   some  people  that  are  deaf  or  hard  of  hearing  aren't  sure  if  they  should  be  hearing  the   sound.       OK.       So  sometimes  in  the  absence  of  sound,  you're  thinking  should  I  be  hearing  something?   Should  I  be  hearing  something?       Right.       You're  probably  more  hard  of  hearing  than  some  people,  so  you  know  the  difference.     For  some  people  they  can't  quite  tell,  so  I  am  telling  you  I  am  not  playing  the  sound.       OK.

So  what  I  want  you  to  do  is  as  you're  watching  the  video  is  I  want  you  think  about  how   you  would  interpret  the  information  that  you  are  seeing.   OK.   What  it  might  mean  to  you--that  kind  of  thing.       OK.       OK?   Sounds  good.    Let's  do  it.       So  this  is  the  first  one.     (MOVING  CIRCLES  STARTS)   Oh,  I  finally  get  that,  OK.         (MOVING  CIRCLES  ENDS)         What  is  it  you  finally  got?       I  was  trying  to  figure  out  this  line  in  the  middle  with  the  very  bright  dots  moving  up   and  down  were  very  distracting  and  make  it  difficult  to  watch  the  rest  of  it  and  I  just   realize  it's  supposed  to  be  the  drum--the  bass  rhythm.    Just  basically  in  my  head  I   can  see  the  various  melodies  and  harmonies  depending  on  the  line--the  bass  line,   the  treble  line.    And  as  it  goes  up  and  down--because  I  did  play  piano--and  I  am   sort  of  thinking  of  the  notes  as  they  go  up  and  down.    And  so  you  can  sort  of  imagine   what  it  should  sound  like.    However,  when  it  gets  to  this  point,  it  is  too  much  to   watch.    So  at  this  point  it's  just  like  they  are  rocking  out  or  it's  just  noise,  you  know?     But  that  line  in  the  middle  was  distracting,  it  was  difficult  to  watch.       Which  line  are  you  talking  about?   This  with  the  very  bright  dots  moving  up  and  down.   Oh,  this  white  line  right  here.       Yeah,  so  and  all  these  bright  dots  and  it  making  me  want  to  just  and  look  away.       The  intention  of  that  line  actually  is  to  tell  you  the  time  point  in  the  video,  right?   Yeah   So  this  is  the  point  where  the  note  starts.

Yeah.       What  did  you  think  about  the  shapes?    Did  you  get  any...   You  mean  the  squares  and  the  circles  or  the  actual...?   Yeah.   The  circles  I  mean  at  first  they  didn't  really  mean  anything  to  me.    I  was  thinking  if   they  are  playing  guitar,  it  might  be  where  the  strumming  is.   Right.       But  at  that  point  I  wasn't  really  watching  them.    If  they  were  moving,  I  could  maybe   see  how  fast  the  music  is  going  and  whether  it  was  going  higher  or  lower  based  on   the  line  direction.    But  all  this  here,  it's  too  much  it  doesn't  mean  anything  to  me.       OK.       Did  you  find  that  the  colours  meant  anything  to  you  at  all?   You  know,  I  like  the  blue,  the  green  and  the  purple.    It  distinguishes  the  lines   without  making  you  focus  too  much  on  one  line.    The  white  is  too  harsh  I  can't  look   at  it.       OK,  that's  fine.       What  did  you  think  of  the  speed  of  the  shapes?       Average.    Seemed  like  a  country  song.    Average.       OK.       Well  what  I  am  going  to  do  now  is  I  am  going  to  switch  you  to  another  visualization.   (RADAR  STARTS)   So  what  do  you  think  of  this  video?   I  actually  like  this  one  a  lot  better.    It  took  me  awhile  to  get  it,  but  I  think  the  longer   you  watch  it,  the  more  you  can  imagine  how  sound  can  relate  to  it.    I  would  say  that   this  up  here  is  the  main  gnawing  of  the  music.    I  am  thinking  higher  ranges  because   it  is  in  the  upper  quadrant.    But  as  it  goes  down  you  can  sort  of  hear  how  long  the   music  holds  out.    It's  playing  quite  fast  up  here,  but  then  it  goes  longer  and  goes   down.    This  is  a  really  great  representation  of  the  music  and  the  beat.    Depending  if   you  know  what  the  colours  mean,  it  could  be  bass  drum,  snare  drum,  cymbals  even.

It's  giving  you  a  better  impression  of  how  hard  it's  been  hit  or  how  loud  it  is.    I  really   like  that.    It's  much,  much  nicer  to  watch  than  the  first  one.    It's  kind  of  neat.                       Do  you  think  the  colours  mean  anything?   I  am  sure  they  do,  but  I  think  that  interpretation  depends  on  the  person.    And  I  can't   attribute  the  sound  to  it  and  that's  why  it  was  difficult  for  me  to  figure  out  at  first   what  it  was  supposed  to  be.   OK.       What  do  you  think  of  the  speed  of  this  thing?   I  am  thinking  electronic.    It's  like...So  it  makes  me  think  of  electronic  music  with  a   bass  driving  beat  throughout  it.    So  you  can  tell  the  music  is  being  played  very  fast   but  the  actual  drum  is  not  being  played  very  fast  so  there's  a  lot  of  different  sounds   going  on.       One  of  things  I  find  interesting  about  your  responses  is...Maybe  I  should  ask  you  first.     How  much  music  training  do  you  have?       (RADAR  ENDS)   I  played  piano  from  the  age  of  5  to  the  age  of  18.    I  played  trumpet  in  high  school   band.    I  played  flute  for  a  year,  but  I  was  terrible.    I  get  music.       Yeah,  that  is  what  I  saying.    You  seem  to  have  a  lot  of  experience  with  music  and   thinking  with  a  musical  brain.       So  I  am  going  to  show  you  my  last  video  now.    Now  this  might  be  a  little  bit  more   familiar  to  you,  partly  because  of  your  generation.       (BARS  STARTS)   Yeah,  this  is  a  rock  song,  if  I  am  looking  at  it  correctly.       (BARS  ENDS)   What  I  am  seeing  is  how  red  it  is;  I  guess  how  loud  and  deep  the  sound  is.    When  I   say  deep,  I  guess  I  mean  low,  but  it  depends  on  the  spectrum.    It's  being  played  quite   fast.    The  beat  is  a  rock  beat.    And  you  can  see  the  bridge  come  up  as  everything  sort   of  raises  a  little  bit.    These  dots  make  me  think  these  are  the  notes  that  are  being   held  a  little  bit  longer.    So  even  though  the  music  is  being  played  quite  quickly,  there   are  some  notes  being  held.    I  think  for  an  inexperienced  watcher  though  it  would  be   difficult  to  follow  because  it's  a  lot  to  look  at  all  at  once.    I  guess  the  colours  can  be

important  in  that  when  there  are  different  colours  for  different  kinds  of  sounds,  it's   easier  to  distinguish  what  you're  looking  at.    And  here,  I  mean  I  can  tell  by  how   much  at  one  end  is  going  up  but  one  who  cannot  see  that  might  have  a  harder  time   distinguishing  it.       So  you  think  something  like  this...you  can  clearly...If  I  am  hearing  you  correctly  what   you're  saying  is  you  can  clearly  see  the  music  in  this.   Yeah.       But  for  something  like  this  it  requires  a  fair  amount  of  training  to  really  see  and   understand.    Well,  they  might.    I  don't  really  know,  but  it  doesn't  seem  to  be  as  clear- cut  as,  for  example,  the  second  one  where  you  could  easily  see  where  the  beat  was   verses  where  some  of  the  other  music  was.    Here,  it's  all  across  the  spectrum.    And   for  someone  who  maybe  can't  quite  hear  the  music  as  well  and  they  don't  know   what  the  sounds  are  like  and  how  they  are  distinguished,  they  might  not  be  able  to   see  that  there.       OK.     So  now  what  I  am  going  to  do  is  I  am  going  to  give  you  this--it's  a  final  questionnaire.     As  you  can  see  each  of  these  are  representations  of  what  I  showed  you  earlier.    In  this   first  question  you  can  mark  it  however  you  want--X,  check,  you  can  even  write.       Just  fit  it  in  the  square?   You  can  even  write  words  if  you  want--totally  up  to  you.           Would  you  rather  have  me  rate  them  or  just  pick  one?   Just  answer  the  question  and  go  from  there
