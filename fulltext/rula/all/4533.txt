Abstract: The Caia Irrigation Perimeter is an irrigation infrastructure implemented in 1968. As is often the case, the original soil map of this region (dated from 1961) does not have the detail needed to characterize a relatively small-sized zone, where intensive agricultural practices take place. Using FAO methodology and with the main goal of establishing a larger-scale soil map, adequate for the demands of a modern and intensive agriculture, we gathered the geological characterization of the study area and information about the topography, climate, and vegetation of the region. Using ArcGIS software, we overlapped this information and established a pre-map of soil resources. Based on this pre-map, we defined a set of detailed itineraries in the field, evenly distributed, in which soil samples were collected. In those distinct soil units, we opened several soil profiles, from which we selected 26 to analyze in the present study, since they characterized the existing diversity in terms of soil type and soil properties. Based on the work of verification, correction, and reinterpretation of the preliminary soil map, we reached a final soil map for the Caia Irrigation Perimeter, which is characterized by enormous heterogeneity, typical of Mediterranean soils, containing 23 distinct cartographic units, the most representative being the Distric Fluvisols with inclusions of Luvisols Distric occupying 29.9% of the total study area, and Calcisols Luvic with inclusions of Luvisols endoleptic with 11.9% of the total area. Considering the obtained information on soil properties; ArcGIS was used to develop a map in which it was possible to ascertain the impact of the continuous practice of irrigation in this area. This allows us to put forward relevant conclusions on the need to access and monitor specific Mediterranean soils in order to mitigate the environmental impact of irrigation practices.

1. Introduction Man has been intervening for a long time in the Mediterranean region introducing sometimes changes that had fostered some sustainability problems to the existing ecosystem [1], in which the knowledge of the soil resource is increasingly important for every agricultural system [2­4]. Based on

this knowledge, we are able to analyze the presence of water and the possibility of practicing irrigation; on the contrary, if given the lack of fitness for a more intensive cultural system that is potentially more productive, one should opt to maintain a rain-fed agricultural system [5,6]. Equally important is appropriate knowledge of the soil as a way to minimize the process of degradation of this unpaired resource and to increase the sustainability of these man-made ecosystems [3], thus contributing to a more consistent agricultural activity with the current requirements concerning environmental protection issues [6­8]. In this regard, the sustainability of Mediterranean agricultural systems constitutes an important issue that deserves our attention and the concern of those who are interested in the sustainability of the Mediterranean basin. Considering that Mediterranean soils are characterized mostly by low or very low organic matter levels, they have a generally weak structure, with an inappropriate aggregation and a low infiltration rate. In addition, the irrigation in these regions is not performed on plan soils, but in soils with slight slopes, sufficient to provide runoff of irrigation water. If we consider that in this region it is common among farmers to use an excess of water, both in terms of total quantity and in terms of instantaneous application, then we have the necessary conditions to have significant erosion phenomena. According to Alexandre & Afonso [9], the Portuguese Soil Map, developed at the scale of 1:50,000 though sufficiently wide for regional planning land use, is insufficient for management at the agricultural production exploitation scale [10]. In fact, this is very clear in the Caia Irrigation Perimeter. This region, with an area of 7240 ha of irrigated land, characterized by a huge diversity of soils, does not appear to be mapped with enough detail when using the Soil Map of Portugal at the scale of 1:50,000. In addition, during the 47 years of operation of this perimeter, many soils have been altered by human intervention due to the necessary soil displacement and leveling, which, besides increasing irrigation efficiency, could have contributed to change in the soil characterization in the early 1960s. Given the above, conducting a detailed study of these soils, considering a deep analytical characterization of the different soil units, constitutes an indispensable and valuable endeavor [4]. This task has become even more important, because at this stage the Caia Irrigation Perimeter is experiencing a period of strong cultural reconversion, moving from traditional productions as tomato and maize to super-intensive olive grove, with all changes to the cultural system resulting therefrom [11]. Finally, it should be mentioned that the soil classification used to define the study area is the nomenclature inherent to the Portuguese Soils Classification Method, which is used almost exclusively at the national level disabling the possibility of assessing it internationally, giving a clear idea of the type or types of soil present in this region [5]. Further, for this reason, it was important to redo the soil classification of the Caia Irrigation Perimeter, using for this purpose an widespread, internationally accepted classification system, as is the case of FAO system (Food and Agriculture Organization) [12­15]. For the reasons previously mentioned, we propose this research work, with the main goal of developing a soil map of the study area, capable of meeting the demands of farmers and technicians in terms of soil characteristic concerns. Additionally, to demonstrate a possible use of this information, we developed a map of the areas particularly vulnerable to degradation due to continuous irrigation practice, particularly important when the irrigated areas in Mediterranean ecosystems grow exponentially, jeopardizing agricultural and environmental sustainability of important areas of our planet. 2.

or rain-fed agriculture, but also among different types of irrigation considering the main goal to contribute to improve sustainability of Mediterranean irrigated agro-systems. Comparing the types of soil of the study area presented in the Portuguese Soil Map at the scale of 1:50,000 (1961) with the Soil Map obtained in the present work, although the classification system used is different and therefore difficult to compare with any other classification system, it is possible to verify the existence of a substantially larger number of different classes in this study, confirming, as previously reported by Alexander & Afonso in 2007 [9], the limitations of the Portuguese Soil Map when further information with greater detail is needed. The augmented number of subclasses in soil classification on our proposal on existing classification is, according to Alexander & Afonso [9] and Nunes et al. [1], an important added value, as it allows us to obtain a much more detailed information distinguishing different soil stains, whose different characteristics (texture, organic matter content, useful depth, existence of an Impermeable soil layer, etc.) lead to the implementation of different irrigation schemes and cultural operations, which enable an increase in the sustainability of these fragile agricultural systems. Concerning vulnerability, as can be seen in Figure 6, there are two zones of greatest vulnerability. One is located in the north-central part of the study area, and coincides with terrain bordering the River Caia. The other is in the southeastern part of the study area, and the west bank of the River Guadiana. The vulnerability to desertification in these two zones can be attributed to irrigation and the heavy use of fertilizers. A more detailed statistical study of the influence of irrigation in the agricultural and environmental degradation of these soils showed that 81.3% of the irrigated land has a high to medium risk of vulnerability, whereas only 25.9% of rain-fed area presents a high or medium vulnerability to degradation. This clearly showed that irrigation can be a major factor of soil degradation in this type of agro-system. In fact, the obtained results are very important because they enable us to identify which areas can be irrigated without any environmental impact, which areas can be irrigated but with extra care in what quantity and quality of applied water regards, and areas where irrigation is not possible from an environmental point of view. This study conducted for the Caia Irrigation Perimeter can be spread to any other irrigation region in the Mediterranean basin, constituting a method of rapid and easy application towards the determination of vulnerable areas regarding environmental degradation due to irrigation practices. The sustainability of the Caia Irrigation Perimeter, implemented four decades ago, is nowadays a matter of large concern, because in particular cases we have already found some areas with significant productivity losses. However, it is noteworthy that the water used in the irrigation area, also examined in the present study, is of very good quality, being classified by FAO as "unrestricted for irrigation", mainly because it was only after 40 years of continuous irrigation that important problems were deeply studied, as soil loss and erosion [28] started to appear. Nonetheless, this is not a general overview for new irrigation areas, in which the used water quality is substantially lower. The environmental degradation of these soils will occur much faster. Therefore, for these soils, the development of a vulnerability map, updated frequently, following this approach, can provide important information in order to enable decision-makers to develop suitability maps as the ones presented by Bathrellos et al. [29], and to take some protective measures for these agro-systems, thus ensuring their environmental and economic sustainability within the framework of rural and agricultural spatial environments [30,31] as well as promote regional innovation patterns. 5. Conclusions The region under study presents a wide range of soils. The performed analysis enabled us not only to classify 23 different soil units according to WRBSR (2006), having a number of substantially higher soil units that shown in Portuguese Soil Map, but also to ascertain that preexisting information, e.g., soil and geological maps, can be very useful in solving known problems [32,33]. Focusing only on higher taxonomic levels, one can see that the dominant soil groups in the region are Fluvisols,

occupying 44.9% of the total area, followed by Luvisols with 29.6% of the total area. These two groups of soils together with Calcisols represent more than 90% (93.2%) of the soils of the region under study. Considering the data collected, it is possible to conclude that a substantial part of the study area's soils is at high risk of degradation (40.3%), both due to the intrinsic characteristics of the soil, and to the fact that it is submitted to irrigation for a very long period, which in some areas has already reached 40 years. For this reason, a periodic monitoring to avoid potentially serious environmental problems is advisable. This contributes to the debate of regional intelligence [34] within the context of agriculture [35], where new combinatory methods that allow spatially explicit models to integrate local decision-making should be fostered [36­38].
