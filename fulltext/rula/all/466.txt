ABSTRACT

EXPLOITATION OF PERCEPTUAL INFORMATION BY 9.5-MONTH-OLD INFANTS IN

SEARCH TASKS
Niusha Ghazban Master of Arts

The relationship between object-knowledge and goal-directed action is critical to understanding cognitive development in the first year of life. Examining the organization of action, perception and cognition in 9.5-month-old infants, the current study first investigates the effects of manipulating perceptual information when searching for a goal-object by coordinating a bi-directional detour reach around transparent, opaque and 50%-graded occiuders to obtain a goal-object. Second, the study explored how changes in cognitive

complexities via a manipulation to the number of hiding-locations (three-vs. five-) affect
infants' problem-solving abilities. Results-demonstrate infants' impressive ability to initiate a mental plan of action and subsequently execute appropriate motor actions. Infants' search benefited most when the object was visible through the occluder and some information about the occluder's solidity was provided. The findings support the lack of memory-inhibition

accounts (Diamond, 1991) and shed light onto previously unexamined elements of perceptual-cognitive development during the first year of life.

information to guide their actions in coordinating a reach around the tunnel in order to search and retrieve the goal-object (i.e., the ball). Second, the study explored how changes to the
number of hiding locations under these perceptual manipulations affect infants' problemsolving abilities. However, in order to identify the structure and organization of infants' decision-making and action-planning that relate to their understandings of object knowledge
and representation, it is important to first examine previous scientific studies and

experiments. It is also important to note that this thesis will examine a comprehensive

literature on human infants' perceptual, motor and cognitive developments in the first year-of life, and while areas of evolutionary psychology (see Bjorklund, 1997) and neurophysiology
(see Case, 1992; Michel, 2001) are relevant and influential, these will not fall within the scope of this review and thus will not be examined.

1.1

HISTORY OF SENSORIMOTOR DEVELOPMENT

Prior to the 1980s, the human neonate was largely viewed as a reflexive creature with a very simple repertoire of sensorimotor behaviours and fixed action patterns that gradually became coordinated and internalized. However, more recent findings have

revealed that the infant is considerably more competent, capable of goal-directed and
spatially coordinated actions. It is nevertheless important to consider early views of

development as many of these ideas have directly influenced how we view the infant and most are still relevant to the current and on-going investigations about the infant's mind and
cognitive knowledge.

Some of the early pioneering leaders in the field of motor development such as Arnold Gesell and Henry Marc Halverson, argued primarily that development was guided and influenced by maturation of the central nervous system and was controlled by unfolding

genes (Ball, 1977). Gesell's most influential contribution was his derivation of a normative
motor timetable describing when children first show particular behaviours as well as the time range that such motor behaviours first appear. Similar to Gesell's work of describing

objects (e.g., grasping and mouthing in particular), leading Piaget to describe the infant as the actor or agent in their environments. Based on the infant's own active exploration and
body movements, he argued that the child forms a repertoire of mental structures or

schemas that allows for the contents of the mind to develop through gradual assimilation and accommodation. Subsequently through repetition and modification of those actions, the infant formulates a more complex representation of their environment and ways of
understanding and interacting with the world. In one now famous observation, when a toy

was covered, infants up to 7- to 8-months behaved as though the toy no longer existed.
Extending from these observations, Piaget reported that infants' object concept and problemsolving abilities emerge at 8-months of age when the infant is able to hold a mental representation of the hidden object and is aware that it continues to exist, despite its disappearance. Indeed, it is now widely believed that the ability to mentally represent and retain information about a hidden object while coordinating an appropriate action to search

and retrieve it, involves complex cognitive abilities. Although the infant is effectively unable to
generate words to describe their understanding of thinking and planning, studies in motor control and development have re-emerged with new rigor suggesting that the infant's actions are in fact reflective of their knowledge about the world. Several key ideas of Piagetian

theory have been incorporated into other accounts and descriptions such as the dynamic
systems theory to better understand (or explain) movement and motor actions. Dynamic systems theory has been most useful in understanding rhythmic or cyclic actions such as kicking, stepping and bouncing; however one of this theory's most relevant aspects to the current study is its emphasis on learning by exploration. This approach has

been greatly influenced by the work of Eleanor Gibson (1984) who argues that infants actively exploit their environments through three basic activities: 1) exploratory activity of the visual perceptual systems, 2) extraction of distinctive feature in the visual field and 3)
observation of consequences of exploratory actions (Rosser, 1994). The first two processes

are strictly perceptual and the latter relates to active motoric exploration. In other words, a

properties, trajectory and location. The term representation is typically used to refer to knowledge and memory of an object's features (i.e., colour, shape) and spatial properties
(i.e., speed, direction and hiding location). Second, the infant must integrate and interpret the

incoming sensory information in order to conduct a course of action. The infant's past
experience and memory of objects and people moving in- and out-of-occlusion will strongly influence the decision on how to organize an appropriate motor response. It is at this third

stage that the infant will decide how, when and where to execute the motor behaviour. Once the object has come to rest (or no longer reappears from occlusion), the infant must
coordinate and carry out a reach towards the correct location and either remove or detour

around the barrier blocking the ball. Finally, as the action is being conducted, information
about the nature of the ongoing behaviour, visual and auditory information as well as movement of the infant's own body through space is continuously fed back into the system allowing the infant to make 'online' modifications and motor adjustments. Moreover, on subsequent hiding events, infants must inhibit a reach towards the location where the object was last seen or rewarded and instead direct their attention towards the most recent hiding

location and execute the appropriate action plan (Moore & Meltzoff, 2008). Therefore, it will
be important to consider each of these components as well as the scientific literature that accounts for the underlying development of object knowledge.

1.2 EARLY OBJECT KNOWLEDGE

From birth, infants have the capacity to visually explore their surroundings and with the coupling of perceptual-action systems, they begin to form very early representations of objects. Several studies have documented newboms' early abilities in discriminating forms such as circles, squares and triangles as well as size and shape constancy (Slater, Mattock, & Brown, 1990; Slater & Morison, 1985; Slater, Morison, & Rose, 1982). Through the use of innovative methodologies like the violation of expectancy (VOE) pioneered by Renee Baillargeon and Elizabeth Spelke (1985), studies have been designed to tap into young

track. Spelke et al. (1992), including additional experiments (Baillargeon, 1987), converge to

show that young infants have innate cognitive representations of the world and are able to
reason about the physical laws of continuity (objects moving on connected paths and do not jump from one place and time to another) and solidity (objects moving on unobstructed

paths). Others have contested the notion that infants possess core knowledge and argue
that findings from VOE studies merely indicate that infants are able to detect changes and

are sensitive to early perceptual experiences (Bertenthal, 1996; Oakes & Cohen, 1990).

Nevertheless, even such visual discrimination or implicit sensitivity to physical attributes and
laws highlights an important foundation for object development that allow the infant to learn about the world. After all, higher-order thinking is dependent upon the development of lower levels of functioning and that the processing and integration of perceptual information is the

initial step towards object knowledge (Williams, 1983). In this section, the role of perception
in prospective behaviours will first be reviewed in the context of infants' visual tracking, anticipatory reaching and visually guided reaching skills. Subsequently, literature on infant and toddler's abilities in searching and retrieval tasks will be considered.

1.2.1 Sight of Hand and Object In the first months of life, infants are already working as "active scientists" who spend many hours persistently engaging and exploring their surroundings. The dynamic system between visual perception and action develop through these everyday experiences and activities, thereby allowing the interaction between the two systems to become well-

coordinated and purposefully directed. Therefore, it is important to understand how infants
use perceptual cues and information in order to coordinate and execute their actions appropriately towards a target-goal of interest. Based on early research studies, it was observed that infants between 3- and 5months of age would often glance between the target object and their reaching hand during

the course of their reach (Piaget, 1952; White, Castle, & Held, 1964). Piaget (1952)

in a new position only when wearing the hand-marker, but not without it. What's more, when

the target remained lit through the entire trial, 9-month-olds performance was comparable to
adults with and without hand markers and infants correctly reached for the target. Overall, it

appears that with development, visually guided reaching becomes an important factor in attaining a target particularly when the task requires immediate motor adjustments. The findings suggest that infants (at least by 9-months of age) are more successful in reaching
for an object that remains stationary or visible during the reach in comparison to when object location and visual information are perturbed. Similarly, McCarty (1993) found that when

sight of a stationary illuminated object is completely eliminated during the latter part of
infants' reaches, 7-month-olds failed to contact the target than when it darkened midway

through the reach while this difference disappeared by 9-months of age. In another study, 6month-old's reaches for a glow-in-the-dark object were similar to reaches made in the light leading to the conclusion that the sight of target-object may also be critical to younger infants
(Clifton, Rochat, Robin, & Berthier, 1994).

In general, visual information is of particular importance when infants engage in

precision eye-hand-coordination tasks--vital ingredients, as noted above, for cognitive

advancement. Based on the studies in this field, it appears that the sight of target is crucial in
planning a reach to the correct location and that sight of hand is particularly helpful in

coordinating the latter parts of reaching to the target, particularly when the task requires
precision. Consequently, it is also important to consider the specific role vision has on
infants' prospective behaviours.

1.2.2 Perception in Prospective Behaviours

The human infant along with comparative infant species, come into the world

adapted to perceive motion (Sekuler & Sekuler, 1993). From birth to 8-weeks of age, the
human infant is capable of detecting and localizing motion using saccadic eye movements

and by 3-months, they are able to track motion using smooth pursuits at an adult level

Another prominent example of future-oriented behaviours by infants is illustrated through visual expectation paradigm by Marshall Haith (1988). In this eye-movement paradigm, infants' eye movements are tracked as they observe small pictures alternating between the left- and right- side of the centre of the screen. From this, it appears that 2- and 3- month-old infants begin to show anticipatory fixations and saccades to the reappearance locations of pictures, even when timing and location of the pictures become more complex (Dougherty & Haith, 2002). In other words, infants can detect spatiotemporal regularities in visual targets and form expectation for what visual targets appears next and subsequently

(re)act on those expectations to make anticipatory eye movements to the site of upcoming targets (Wentworth, Haith, & Hood, 2002). The success of pursuit tracking at such an early
age is especially impressive given that the infants' heads were unrestrained during testing;

yet infants were still successful in tracking objects with a combination of head and eye
movements.

The observation of predictive reaching for moving targets appears developmental^
after predictive visual tracking due to the increased dynamical difficulty of coordinating one's

reach to one's vision. As previously discussed, the execution of a successful reach is nested
in a hierarchy of behaviours such as eye movements, eye-head coordination and eye-hand
coordination. Von Hofsten was the first to study infants reaching for objects moving at

various speeds in a horizontal arc (von Hofsten, 1980; von Hofsten & Lindhagen, 1979). The studies found that infants as young as 18-weeks of age reach for moving targets in a

predictive way and are capable of catching objects moving up to 30 cm/sec by 5-months and
125 cm/sec by 8- months of age (von Hofsten, 1983; von Hofsten, Vishton, Spelke, Feng, &

Rosander, 1998). The success of catching the moving object requires that the infant predict
the anticipated position of the moving object and initiate arm and hand movements so as to

intercept the object, instead of chasing or waiting for the target (Robin, Berthier, & Clifton,
1996; von Hofsten, 1983; von Hofsten & Lindhagen, 1979). Furthermore, the reaching hand

also needs to be adjusted to the orientation, form and size of the object (von Hofsten, 2007).

found. Based on these striking observations with his children, Piaget concluded that infants

lack the concept of object permanence; a conclusion that has been challenged under
controlled laboratory conditions in recent decades.

However, it also appears that the physical act of reaching and coordinating the arm
towards the target-goal seems crucial to error (Smith, Thelen, Titzer, & McLin, 1999). Using

methodologies such as the violation-of-expectancy paradigm and other measures of looking
time previously discussed, infants have demonstrated some expectations of object behaviours and hiding properties however, when infants are asked to demonstrate their

knowledge through action, they often fail. An experimental account by Hofstadter and Reznick (1996) provided a direct comparison between performances in A-not-B task where infants either responded by reaching for the hidden object (as per the original A-not-B tasks), or by looking to the hiding location. The study found that infants made more errors when required to actively search for the object (by reaching) than in the looking task. Many developmental scientists have attributed discrepancies between young infants' looking behaviour on occlusion tasks and the older infants' failure on manual search-tasks to a deficit
in the means--end planning (Baillargeon, 1986; Baillargeon, Graber, Devos, & Black, 1990;
Bower, Broughton, & Moore, 1971).

A means-end sequence typically involves acting on an initial object (e.g., pulling a cloth, displacing a stimulus), and then acting on a subsequent object (e.g., removing a cover, pushing a button) to obtain (or reveal) an end-goal. A deficit in this account means that young infants are aware of the hidden object's location but cannot coordinate their motor
behaviour to remove the intermediate obstacle(s) or sub goals that then allow them to search

and obtain the desired end-goal object. The ability to differentiate between and choose
appropriate sequences of action (and tools) to achieve the ultimately end-goal emerges at about 8- to 9-months of age. Prior this age, infants are unable to conjoin actions to manipulate the barrier to get to the occluded object. In addition to VOE paradigm's support

for this account, studies conducted in the dark also support the means-end deficit account. In

eliminate any biases to the midline (Butterworth, 1975), the 7-hiding wells were embedded in
into a table and arranged in a semi-circle. The infants were tested for their abilities in
retrieving the goal-object in three different conditions. In the first condition, the object was

placed into a well and a tray was pushed forward covering the wells simultaneously. In the
second condition, the toy was hidden by lowering it into a well. In the third condition, a cloth over a well was removed, the toy was lowered into a well and the well was re-covered by the same cloth. In both the second and third conditions, the last action was conducted at the correct well where the toy was hidden, whereas in the first condition, the last action was the pushing of the tray to cover the wells all at once and did not draw attention to the correct

hiding-location. Findings revealed that performance in the first condition (i.e., wells covered
simultaneously) was significantly worse than performance in the other two conditions. In

addition, infants' performance on the 7-hiding locations covered at the same time was significantly below the performance in 2-hiding locations (i.e., A-not-B task). Not surprising,
when attention is drawn to the correct well, performance on 7-hiding locations is as good as 2-hiding locations. Interestingly, the types of errors infants conducted in this study were not random. When the new hiding location is not an endpoint (i.e., well 1 or well 7), infants make errors by reaching to either side of the correct well, and disproportionately err in the direction of the previously correct (and rewarded) location. These results have led Diamond (1991, 1994) to hypothesize that lack of performance on multiple-hiding locations is due to a combination of weak memory and inhibition. Therefore according to the hypothesis about

frontal cortex immaturity, the infants' inability to retrieve objects and problem solve is not due to a lack of conceptual understating but due to an inability to remember and inhibit previously
correct responses.

As previously argued, sensory information from the environment must be integrated

and processed in order for other series of events (i.e., action planning) to occur. When faced
with a challenging task of retrieving a target-object under occlusion, sensori-information about the object and its location are critical in successful retrieval. Some scholars have

1.4 MANIPLUATION OF VISUAL OCCLUSION IN SEARCH-TASKS

Search-tasks are an ideal method to investigate many aspects of cognitive
development, such as memory, logic reasoning, spatial representation and problem-solving

(Butler et al., 2002). Everyday environments are filled with barriers and obstacles presenting a complex scenario, rich with sensory and perceptual information that must be integrated and processed. This task is often challenged when the direct visual view of targets are partially or completely blocked by other nearer objects and surfaces. Not only does the structure of perceptual information change as the infant and objects continuously move, but with such active exploration, the infant is further challenged in coordinating their movements to reach for objects that cannot be directly obtained. One method to test infants' abilities in search-tasks is to manipulate the object's perceptual information using transparent or opaque occluders. This represents an interesting approach for the study of infants' searching behaviour because transparent barriers still engage the infant in the same necessary motor actions as objects behind opaque barriers, but provide the added advantage of having direct visual of the target throughout the course of action. Conversely, opaque barriers eliminate all perceptual information about the object and the infant must navigate their actions based on a mental representation (or memory) Of the object. With the above, it becomes imperative to examine experimental research on infants' performance under various visual manipulations

when searching for stationary and dynamic objects and understand how infants problemsolve when attempting to retrieve objects that are not directly within their reach.

1.4.1 Searching for Stationary Objects

The review of literature on infants' performance in search and retrieval tasks based on manipulations of perceptual information is divided. A clever series of studies by Shinkskey and colleagues (2000) has found that 5- to 8-month old infants retrieved a toy from a behind a transparent curtain more often than from behind a semi-transparent or opaque curtain and that such difficulties were more apparent in younger infants (i.e., 5- to 7-month-olds) than 818

and 11.2-months respectively). However, infants generally experienced less difficulty with

opaque barriers than with corresponding transparent ones, as many infants attempted to
reach or locomote directly through the transparent screens or by shaking the edges of the screen. Lockman (1984) concluded that these difficulties suggest a conflict between visual and other perceptual information (i.e. tactual perception) for making a detour around the transparent barrier, and most often the visual information predominates making detours around transparent barriers unsuccessful. In other words, infants must first recognize that they cannot reach or locomote through the transparent barrier, then suppress the strong tendency to reach directly for the object and subsequently plan an indirect (i.e. detour) reach to the target-object. Given that infants have a limited pool of processing resources, the increased amount of planning and inhibition of executing a direct reach through the transparent barrier results in deteriorating cognitive planning and motor action. A subsequent study by Lockman, and Adams (2001) tested detour ability of 10- and

12-month-old infants around barriers that differed in transparency. Once again, infants made
reaching and locomotor detours to retrieve a target-object around a clear-transparent barrier or a clear-transparent barrier overlaid with a grid-pattern using black tape; the net effect was to create a transparent barrier with partial information suggesting occlusion. The authors reported that older infants were more successful and required less time to retrieve the object from behind the barriers than their younger 10-month-old counterparts. They go on to report that both younger and older infants were faster and more successful when making detour

reaches around the barriers (vs. locomoting) and demonstrated more success and less time to retrieve objects from behind grid-like barriers. Interestingly, Lockman's analysis of exploratory attempts with the barriers indicated that younger infants attempted to contact the
object through the barriers more often than the older infants but that in general, avoiding a

reach through transparent barriers was not learned as quickly as with the grid-like barrier
across both age groups.

1.4.2 Searching for Dynamical Objects

In contrast to search-tasks for stationary objects, an object that continues to move
hinders search performance as it has to be continually represented as it undergoes occlusion. As discussed in earlier sections, when acting on a moving object, it is not only necessary to use visual information to coordinate a reach ahead of the moving object, but it is also important to use perceptual information to estimate the future position and motion of the object. Such prospective cohtrol is fundamental in the execution of purposeful behaviour
and is particularly salient during early development.

Through a series of studies, Berthier (2001), Keen (2003), and their colleagues directly assessed representation of hidden objects with 9-month-old infants. Berthier, Bertenthal, Seaks, Sylvia, Johnson and Clifton (2001) investigated infants' visual tracking or reaching for a ball that rolled down a ramp (from left to right) behind a solid-opaque occluding screen. On some of the trials, the path of the moving ball was blocked by a wall
positioned behind the opaque occluder which protruded several centimeters above the

occluder. If infants represent the object moving and reasoned that it would be stopped by the wall, they would not expect the object to emerge from occlusion. After presenting infants with random Wall and No-Wall trials, it was found that although infants made more anticipatory
reaches to intercept the ball when no-wall was present on the track, infants often shifted their gaze and executed a reach to the right of an occluder when in fact a wall was present on the track. Consequently the examination of the kinematics of reaches on wall and no-wall trials indicated that once a reach was initiated, it continued all the way to the track. Based on these findings, it was suggested that the infants were so "intent" on catching or pursuing the

moving ball that they simply could not keep track of whether or not a wall was present (Keen
& Berthier, 2004).

Moreover, the wall's top portion protruding above the occluder did not serve as an obvious cue to its presence and the authors rationalized that the wall's limited visibility with

the opaque screen placed additional burden onto the already difficult perceptual-motor task. '"

reaching on wall-trial. Moreover, in comparing infants' ability to search for the ball resting

against the wall, the results indicated that more infants in the window condition correctly
directed their first search for the stationary ball to the left of the occluding screen in
comparison to the other two conditions. The authors' speculation behind infants' greater

search success in the 'window' condition is that in comparison to the fully transparent screen,
the window in the occluding screen provides information about the solidity and impenetrable

nature of the wall that helps infants plan a detour reach. Thus, in comparison to the fully
opaque screen, a window in the opaque screen serves as a reminder of the wall's presence

(Keen et al., 2003). Based on these results, it can be argued that such "reminders" serve to reduce the cognitive load because infants do not have to remember the solidity of the
occluding screen or the vertical extension of the wall that extends down to the track and can

therefore, coordinate and execute an appropriate reach to find the ball. Just as it appears
that we understand infant cognition that infants by 9-months of age are beginning to express some rudimentary knowledge that of physical laws (i.e., solidity, and continuity) through their actions, several studies with children 2- to-3-years of age indicate that toddlers are not able to successfully problem-solve when asked to search for hidden-objects.

1.4.3 Developmental Discontinuity - Review of Toddlers' Performance

Given the rich literature on young infants' abilities to search for hidden objects behind
barriers, occluders, among a variety of hiding locations (even if the object is in motion), it is perhaps reasonable to assume that these skills should be well developed in toddlers. This said however, in examining the literature on toddlers' search-task performance, it is apparent

that the there is a discontinuity in the development of visuospatial reasoning and physical knowledge.
In a study based Spelke (1992) on the VOE paradigm, Berthier, DeBloid, Poirer,

Novak and Clifton (2000) presented 2-, 2.5-, and 3-year-olds a ball rolling down a ramp
behind an occluding screen with four doors. Prior to rolling the ball down the ramp, children

al., (2008) modified the wall such that the entire length of the wall was visible as it over-

hanged the occluder screen (with doors) as it had proved successful for 9-month-old infants
(Keen etal., 2003).

The investigators also attempted to increase children's motivation by providing stickers as rewards on correct trials. The increased visibility of the wall and reward on correct responses helped only some of 2.5-year-old children. In the third study, the experimenter's hand was used as the wall to stop the ball based on the notion that infants are very sensitive to the intention of other's manual acts (Woodward, 1999). Once again, it was found that the switch to a human arm and hand did not significantly improve 2.5-year-olds' performance on finding the ball. Subsequently, the investigators examined if 3-year-olds success on the search-tasks was based on a simple associative strategy (i.e., learn to open the door to the immediate left of the wall on the track) or whether their success was based on a deeper cognitive achievement about physical laws of rolling balls and barriers. Therefore in the

fourth study, the ball was rolled down the track from left-to-right as well as right-to-left. It was
reported that 3-year-olds performance was significantly above chance and that the wall is an important cue in guiding their reach. The last study investigated if toddlers could maintain memory of a much shorter wall's position on the track. After showing the position of the wall, the occluding screen (with doors) was lowered to completely obscure both the track and the wall and then the ball was rolled down the track undergoing invisible displacement (as per Berthier et al., 2000). The study found that remembering the ball's location without any direct visual cue (of the wall) placed an additional burden on their memory that still proved to be too difficult for 3-year-olds as it had been for 9-month-old infants (Berthier et al., 2000). The

authors concluded that the toddlers' failure in these search-tasks appears to lie not in the failure of attention to the barrier, but more related to lack of visuospatial reasoning about the layout of the ball, wall and the doors as well as a failure in the planning and organization of the search behaviour itself. That is, 3-year-olds poor performance relates to the dual task of

retrieving the toy, in comparison to a search for a hidden object (i.e., behind an opaque

barrier). In addition, this study will determine whether partial sight of the target (behind a
semi-occluded barrier) is sufficient for infants to perform a successful search, and if not, looks at the extent to which infants' performance is disrupted in terms of success rates at

retrieving the ball, reaching frequency, reach initiation, search errors and examine exploratory behaviours with the occluders (e.g., patting, banging etc.). In the current study,
infants must not only plan and problem-solve for a means to get to the target, but motoric demands are equated such that infants are required to execute and coordinate a bi directional action sequence (i.e., detour reach) to attain the target-object where a direct reach is not a possible route. While 9- to 10-month-old infants have been shown to search for hidden and visible

objects in multiple hiding-locations, it is not clear how changes in cognitive complexities via
increase to the number of hiding locations will affect infants' performance in search-tasks particularly when coordinating complex sequences of action. As a result, the current study changes task demands by presenting infants with two sets of hiding conditions with increased or decreased number of hiding locations that will ultimately address the nature of problem-solving abilities in infants. Additionally, the role of the occluder as a distracter and as well as an obstacle is also investigated with regards to its effect on infants' reaching and performance.

Lastly, there are several proposed accounts of infants' performance in manualsearch tasks that are ultimately responsible for infants' improved or failure in search skills
including means-end deficit, problem-solving abilities, spatial knowledge as well as memory

and inhibition. This thesis attempts to address these concepts and potentially shed light onto previously unexamined elements of perceptual-cognitive development in the first year of life--a period where subtle shifts in perceiving and acting have critical impact on the child's cognitive life and understanding of the world around them.

the ball in comparison to the transparent conditions but less so, in comparison to the 50%
graded occluders.

Objective #2: How does cognitive manipulation via increased hiding locations affect
performance in search-tasks?
A secondary goal will determine how infants' problem-solving ability changes as

cognitive demands of the task are manipulated. To test this question, infants' attentional and problem-solving performance will be observed by manipulating the number of possible hiding

locations (three- vs. five) under each set of the occluder types described above. It is rationalized that a three-hiding task will effectively alleviate any random searching where the
success of retrieving the ball cannot occur by chance alone. On the other hand, a five-hiding task is rationalized to be significantly more difficult than a three-hiding location, but is less

likely to cause fatigue and that any search errors can be more easily discovered between the two hiding-tasks. It is hypothesized that in general, infants should perform significantly better
and display faster ball retrieval in the three-hiding locations. Specifically, search-success

would be greatest under the three-hiding locations with graded occluders in comparison to
the opaque or transparent counterparts.

Objective #3: Potential explanations and accounts for infant difficulties in search-tasks
Currently, there are four potential explanations on 8- to 10-month-old infants' difficulties in search-tasks. One interpretation of infants' difficulties has been the notion that
although infants between 8-to 10-month-old demonstrate object permanence, they often

search in the wrong location due to a lack of object permanence or deficits in problemsolving abilities because infants may not fully understand that hidden objects continue to exist (Butterworth, 1975, 1977; Piaget, 1954; Shinskey & Munakata, 2003; Smith et al., 1999;
Willatts, 1984). Alternatively, difficulties in search-tasks may be due to infants' lack of spatial

reasoning or visual salience particularly when searching between multiple-hiding locations.

2.2 STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYSES

To understand infants' abilities in search-tasks, the study was designed such that the
cognitive complexity of the apparatus could be manipulated by presenting either five or three-hiding locations. The increase or decrease in the number of hiding locations manipulates the cognitive demands when searching for the object. What's more, the study examined the influence of visual occlusion by hiding the goal-object behind sets of cleartransparent, soli-opaque or 50% graded occlusions under each of the two hiding-tasks at random locations. The presentation of the two types of hiding-location was counterbalanced, where five-females and five-males began the study with three-hiding locations and subsequently completed the five-hiding task, while the other five females- and-males completed the

reverse. Moreover, if an infant began the session with one-type of hiding task a switch to the
other hiding-task did not occur until the infant had completed all the occluder types within

that hiding task. That is, an infant began the study in with a five-hiding task, all sets of opaque, transparent and graded occluders would be (randomly) presented before a switch to
the thee-hiding task was made.

Furthermore, the occluder types were shown as groups or sets and never mixed;
once presented with a set of occluders, a switch to the next occluder set was made only after

the infant had completed all trials within that occluder condition. Specifically, if an infant was exposed to a set of opaque occluders, the ball was randomly hid under all occluder opaque occluders before a switch to a different occluder type was made. In all hiding-tasks and within each randomly presented set of occluder types, the trials' ramp-side and occluder location (where the ball would stop) were randomized. In fact, the randomization of the

occluder types within each hiding task, the hiding location underneath each occluder and the

planning.

2.3 APPARATUS DESIGN AND RATIONALE

This will be one of the first studies of its kind to examine infants' abilities to search for dynamically moving object behind various occluder types while manipulating cognitive complexities using multiple-hiding locations. Therefore, upon describing the design of the apparatus, the rationale used to construct this particular design will be discussed. Indeed,
the apparatus for this study was designed from the "ground up" over a period of several months with careful attention paid to key task parameters from the previous studies outlined
in the thesis introduction.

All infants were seated on their parent/ guardian's lap during the entire testing phase in front of a custom built table. A small attractive ball (i.e., a golf ball) rolled along a straight ramp (75 cm) that allowed the researcher to roll the ball at an average speed of 63.5 cm/sec from either the right or left-side towards the infant. The table's edge closest to the infant was cut in a manner whereby the table surrounded the infant on both sides forming a semi-circle.
Both types of hiding-tasks (i.e., three- and five-hiding locations) were set on the circular portion of the track (30 degrees apart) and each within the infant's 29-cm reaching radius, with the straight edges of the occluder closest to the infant set within infant's 20-cm reaching
radius (see Figures 1 and 2). Butterworth (1975) has suggested that arranging hiding

locations in a semicircle effectively offsets the tendency to reach to the midline.

five-hiding task.

Figure 2: View of the Ramp Task apparatus with the three sets of occluder types in

Using a small clear-transparent peg (2 cm x 3 cm x 1 cm), the ball was stopped at a random pre-determined locations behind one of the three sets of Plexiglas occluders (10 cm
width x 9 cm height): clear transparent, solid-opaque or graded with 50% occlusion
constructed by overlaying a transparent Plexiglas with blue tape (18-mm). During the 'warm-

up' phase, infants were familiarized with the apparatus and the occluders using a different
ball and occluder type (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: Types of test occluders. (Left to Right) Solid-Opaque occluder, ClearTransparent occluder, 50% Graded occluder.

During the testing phase six possible sets of occluders in the two types of hidingtasks were presented to the infants (see Figure 4 and Study Design for occluder
presentation).

All materials were designed and built to be infant safe with smooth rounded edges, carpeted surfaces, and the use of non-toxic paint. Two cameras were positioned such that infants' visual tracking and engagement with the apparatus was captured, while another camera was situated at an angle and recorded the top-view of the entire apparatus as well as infants' behavioural responses and reaches. The data was determined from the postvideo coding , raw data refinement, and analyses. Indeed, placing objects in dynamic conditions (movement) does present an intriguing arena for which to study infants' representational knowledge. Additionally, the curvilinear trajectory of the ball across the semi-circular table was also rationalized to increase motivation yet ease tension of reaching as the object is equidistant to the infant in comparison to a linearly moving object. In essence, these manipulations are more applicable to real-world events as objects continuously appear and disappear and often in non-linear trajectories. Infants are also more increasingly engaged in these types of tasks in comparison for a search directed to static objects. The target-object (i.e., the golf ball) was purposely chosen to emit no auditory cues as it travelled down and across the infants' visual field. Although research with infants shows

using a means-end task (i.e., remove obstacle to reach object), but it would not be the

easiest nor the most efficient way to achieve the goal. In fact, a detour reach in comparison
to a means-end action sequence is a also a simpler two-step process which 9- to 10-month olds should have minimal difficulties in performing. As a result, this manipulation is thought to aid infants in using their cognitive skills in problem-solving as opposed to action planning. Lastly, the requirement to make a detour reach is consistent with the motor demand requirements used in other studies by Lockman (1984, 2001) and Diamond (1994).

2.4

PROCEDURE

On arrival at the CHILD Lab, the participant and the parent were met by a CHILD lab
member who provided the parent with the informed-consent form describing the study's purpose and procedure (see appendix 1). Parent/guardians were provided with option of completing the CHILD Pre Observations Questionnaire (CPOQ) pertaining to their infant's motoric development and milestones (see appendix 2). The time spent in this preobservation period is very critical to the success of any infant study; that is, infant and-parent "lab/experimenter acculturation" must be established in the first 30 minutes of arrival in the lab. Once the researcher assessed that the infant was ready to begin the study, the parent

and the child were invited into the testing room, where the infant was seated on the mother's lap behind the semi-circular table so that all the hiding locations were equidistant from the infant. A collection of toys (squeak toys, rattles etc.) were available so that the researcher could attract the infants' attention where necessary and keep the child's level of interest high. A research assistant was also present in the room monitoring the video and was responsible

for providing the researcher with information about the trial types that were being presented,
but did not interact or make any eye-contact with the infant. The researcher kneeled on the other side of the table, opposite the parent and infant and was responsible for keeping the infant interested in the apparatus as well as removing and installing the occluders and

40

releasing the ball. All sessions were recorded on videotape capturing dual camera views with
an advanced time code stamp.

In the pretesting or 'warm-up' session, the occluder and the balls used were different than those in the testing session. The warm-up occluder was graded at an angle and the testing stimulus was a significantly larger and multi-coloured ball presented to the infant at
midline (see Figure 5).

Figure 5: Warm-up occluder presented to infant at mid-line.

Infants were first familiarized with a ball behind the warm-up occluder and their ability to reach around the occluder to touch the ball was tested. This was a "giveaway" trial in that

the researcher often reached to either side of the occluder and pushed the ball around. This was done to help the infant overcome initial reluctance to reach behind the occluders. In the
event that the infant's hand could not physically reach the ball, they were propped up using pillow on their parent's lap. Once the infant was shown how to retrieve the ball from both the right and left-side of the occluder, the warm-up ball was taken to one side of the ramp and

the infants' attention was drawn to the ball's location of release using the collection of noise
making toys or by tapping the ball at the edge of ramp. The ball was released and the baby
was assessed in their abilities to track the ball's trajectory across the table. The participants

were allowed to retrieve the ball from the track and received social encouragement from the researcher and their mother. The social encouragement was introduced because infants seemed not to understand the "game" without it and would often take interest in manipulating the occluder. If there was any doubt about whether the infant was reaching for the toy, the

41

trial was repeated. All infants succeeded here except for one infant who did not visually track
the ball; the 'warm-up' phase last approximately 2-minutes.

A test-trial began with the appropriate random occluders placed on the table and the
peg placed underneath where the ball would come to rest. The baby was distracted the

entire time so that they were not aware of the peg's placement. Subsequently, the researcher placed the golf-ball on the ramp (that were randomly selected at right or left-side) and attracted the infant's attention by tapping the ball and said, "Look (baby's name)! Look at the Ball. Here it goes!", and released the ball. The parent were asked to gently restrain the

infant's arms and torso as the ball rolled down the track, to prevent reaching, leaning towards
the moving ball or to the correct hiding location. On average, the ball's travel from its initial release to its resting location lasted approximately 4-seconds (depending on the occluder).

Once the ball came to rest, parents were allowed to verbally encourage their children in
retrieving the ball but where instructed to not point or lead their child's arm or body towards

the correct locations. Specifically, parents were asked that all movements had to be initiated by the infant but that they were allowed to prop-up their children throughout the course of the testing phase. The infant's reach to the correct location and success in obtaining the ball or the peg was rewarded by a play period with the toy and social-encouragement from both the
researcher and the parent. If the infant reaches incorrectly, they were allowed to self-correct

and reach to another location. However, if the infant gave up searching or was unsuccessful in obtaining the ball, the researcher took the ball from behind the occluder and said, "Here is the ball, I found it!" and the infant was allowed to take the ball and social encouragement was
once again rewarded.

2.5

CODING SCHEME

In both proposed studies, infants were video-taped to measure their core

performance where the initial scoring of the data was done by viewing the videotapes from
pilot subjects. Overall, there were 4 passes made when coding each trial.
42

The first pass essentially recorded all relevant information about the trial, such as Trial number (1-24), Occluder Type (opaque, transparent, graded), Hiding Task (three or five), Occluder number (1-3 or 1-5) and Ramp side (right or left) as well as if the infant was visually tracking the ball (yes or no) as it rolled across the table. When tracking the object

behind opaque occluders, infants tended to make rapid saccading head-shifts as the object
appeared and disappeared. As a result, head movements were used more than eye

movements towards the direction in which infants were looking to score for visual tracking.
The second pass recorded that Start Time as indicated by when the ball made contact with the stopper (i.e., a clear-transparent peg) and Reach Initiation, indicating the beginning of a purposeful movement of the hand towards the object or the occluder that was not part of a turning motion or torso rotations. In fact, a valid reach onset was required to make contact with either the occluder or the object. This measure is designed to determine how infants integrate and process the visual information and make a cognitive decision to coordinate an action.
A third pass through the data concentrated on the infants' interaction with the

occluder. The time at which the infant made Contact with Correct Occluder and Contact with Incorrect Occluders, as well as the Frequency of the Correct Occluder Touch was counted.

Contact was defined as the point at which the infant's hand first touched the respective
occluder or object. The frequency measure was indicative of infants' intention as well as their understanding of the occluder as an obstacle. Careful notes were made of the Occluder Removal (occluder number with hand used) as well as all Exploratory Behaviours at the

occluder space, as follows:
· Edge Grasping: Infant grasps the left or right curvilinear edges of the
occluder between fingers and/or palm

·

Direct Reaching: Infant reaches and grasps as though attempting to directly make contact with the ball through the occluder, naturally with no success

43

Contour Following: Infant glides their hand over the occluder and follows its

contour with one continuous motion
. Banging: Infant patting or banging on the occluder

Pressing: Infant attempts to press the occluder in forward and backward
motion (i.e., push and pull) with one motion.

·

Clear Reaching: Infant makes a detour reach around the occluder without
making contact (i.e., all digits and hands clear the occluder).

·

Corrected Reaching: Infants hand or finger is caught onto the edge of the
occluder but no intentional occluder exploration is witnessed.

·

Non-Occluder Exploration: Infant does not explore the occluder and engages

in other forms of activities (i.e., playing with the table etc.). . Peeking: Infants lean to either right or left side in order to gain visual sight of the ball, or gain visual of their hand reaching behind the occluder.
Hand-Tracking: The infant has broken out of their mother's gentle-restraint

and has initiated an anticipatory reach by following the ball's trajectory by
floating their hand above along its motion to the resting location.

The fourth and final review of the videotape determined the time whereby a Contact with the Ball or the peg was made. In addition, the Type of Reaching infants made when executing a

detour reach around the occluder was also recorded where infants could perform five types
of reaching to search for the ball:

.

Right-Contralateral: Infants' right hand enters the left side of the occluder

Left- Contralateral: Infants' left hand enters the right side of the occluder
. . Right Ipsilateral: Infants' right hand enters the right side of the occluder Left Ipsilateral: Infants' left hand enters the left side of the occluder
Removal: Infant removes the occluder

44

In general, a trial was excluded if the infant was not engagement in the task and did not intentionally interact with the apparatus. More specifically, the infant was required to visually track the ball's trajectory as well as initiate a purposeful reach towards either the object or the occluder. If the infant was not looking in the direction of their reach or did not
appear to intentionally make contact with the occluder or the ball, then the reach was not coded and the trial was excluded.

The data was coded between two coders, one blind to the purpose of the study and to the experimental manipulations. A reliability analysis was completed on 25% of random selection of trials for the dependent measures of time intervals for Reach Initiation (r= .991),

Correct Occluder Touch (r= .984), Time Touch Ball (r= .971), which are considered to be
compatible and strong for search-tasks involving infants in this age group.

revealed that infants' reaction towards the opaque occluders (M= 4.07, SE = .54) are significantly slower in comparison to graded (M= 2.11, SE = .39, p<.05, r = .68) and transparent occluders (M= 2.53, SE = .48, p<.05, r= .65). However, the reaction time between transparent and graded occluders was not significantly different. There was also no significant effect of gender indicating that the reaction times from male and female infants

were in general the same, F(1, 18) <1, p>.05, r=.O2. Therefore, independent of the number
of hiding-locations and gender, infants' reaction initiation once the ball has stopped is significantly slower when the ball is out-of-sight under opaque conditions.

Start Time to Correct Occluder Touch. The start time is a measure of the time the ball made
contact with the peg and the correct occluder touch was a measure of the time the infant first

made contact with the correct occluder where the ball was behind. A mixed factorial ANOVA
for Gender X Occluder Type X Hiding-task, revealed that the Mauchley's test indicated that

the assumption of sphericity had been violated for occluder type (X2 (2) = 6.57, p<.05);
therefore degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (8 = .76 ). The results of the ANOVA revealed a significant main-effect for occluder

occluders (M= 3.29, SE = .47, p<.001, r= .63). However, the time different between transparent and graded occluders was not significantly different. There was also no
significant effect of gender indicating that the reaction times from male and female infants were in general the same, F(1, 18) <1, p>.05, r=.O7. There was also a significant main-effect for hiding-task, F(1, 18) = 9.84, p<.05, r = .59). Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that touching the correct occluder under three-hiding task (M= 2.73, SE= .47) are significantly faster in comparison to the five-hiding task (M= 4.86, SE = .63). Therefore, independent of gender differences, infants are generally faster at touching the correct occluder when the ball is behind the transparent or graded occluders and perform faster under three-hiding task conditions, but the interaction between the type of occluder and hiding task are not significant.

A mixed factorial ANOVA for Gender X Occluder

Type X Hiding-task was conducted to determine any differences in the frequency of times infants touched the correct occluder. The analyses revealed that the Mauchley's test

indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated for occluder type (X2 (2) = 8.84, p<.05) as well as for the interaction between hiding-task and occluder type (X2 (2) = 13.427,
p<.001); therefore degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (S = .71, .65 respectively). The results of the ANOVA revealed a significant
main-effect for occluder type, F(1.42, 25.62) = 15.49, p<.001 (see Figure 8). Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that the transparent occluder conditions are more frequently touched (M= 3.54, S£ = .352) in comparison to the graded (M= 1.90, SE = .17, r= .68) and opaque (M= 1.77, SE = .24, r=.68) occluders. However, the frequency of touching the correct occluders

between graded and opaque occluders was not significantly different. There was also no significant effect of gender indicating that the reaction times from male and female infants were in general the same, F(1, 18)= 1.32, p>.05, r=.26. Therefore, regardless of hiding task or gender, all infants more frequently touched the correct occluder under transparent
conditions when the object was fully-visible in comparison to the other conditions.

3.2 OBJECT CONTACT AND RETRIEVAL Ball Touch. A mixed factorial ANOVA for Gender X Occluder Type X Hiding-task was conducted to determine any differences between start time and the time when the ball was touched. The analyses revealed that the Mauchley's test indicated that the assumption of

sphericity had been violated for occluder type (X2 (2) = 6.47, p<.05); therefore degrees of
freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (S = .76). The results of the ANOVA revealed a significant main-effect for occluder type, F(1.59, 27.34) = 9.62, p<.05 (see Figure 9). Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that touching the ball under graded conditions {M= 8.09, SE = .93) are significantly faster in comparison to transparent

(M= 14.01, SE = 1.87, p<.05, r= .69) and opaque occluders {M= 12.92, SE = 1.09, p<.001, r
= .76). However, the time different between transparent and opaque occluders was not significantly different. There was also no significant effect of gender indicating that the reaction times from male and female infants were in general the same, F(1, 18) <1, p>.05,

a=.04. Therefore, from the moment the ball stopped against the peg to the time the infants
successfully touched the ball (or peg), infants demonstrated faster performance only when part of the object was visible but not when it is fully visible or hidden.

Interval between Occluder and Ball Touch. A mixed factorial ANOVA for Gender X Occluder

Type X Hiding-task was conducted to determine if any differences between the time infants
contacted the correct occluder and touching the ball had occurred. The analyses revealed a near significance for occluder type F(2, 28) = .325, p= .064, and no significant main-effects

for hiding task F(1, 18) = .69, p>.05, or an interaction between occluder type and hiding-task F(2, 36) = 1.02, p>.05. There was also no significant effect of gender indicating that the male and female infants' performance were in general the same, F(1, 18) <1, p>.05. Therefore, once infants made contact with the correct occluder, they are just as likely to touch the ball regardless of where the object is visible, partly-visible or fully-hidden.

Ball Retrieval. Chi-square test between occluder-type and success in obtaining the ball

indicated a significant association (X2 (2) = 6.26, p<.05), such that of the 264-counts (56.8%)
of success in obtaining the ball, 37.5% was obtained under graded occlusion trials (see Figure 11). Moreover, there was greater success obtaining the ball from underneath graded

occluder trials (64.3%) in comparison to success in the opaque (55.8%) and transparent

52

(50.3%) conditions. The effect size associated with this relationship as measured by Cramer's Vwas 0.12 which suggests a small effect size. However, no significant association

between hiding-task and success in obtaining the ball was found (X2 (1) = 0.002, p>.05).

However, a significant association between occluder number and success in obtaining the

ball was found at the five-hiding task (X2 (4) = 14.51, p<.05) with an effect size of 0.22 (as

measured by Cramer's V), but not in the three-hiding task (X2 (2) = 3.133, p>.05; see Figure
12). Specifically, infants were most successful in retrieving the ball under the fourth occluder (26.5%) and third occluder (22.3%). Therefore, it infants are more likely to successfully retrieve the ball or peg from underneath the third and fourth occluder locations with least success at the extremities (i.e., occluder number one and five) as well as the second
occluder.

3.3 EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOURS Exploration with Occluders. From a total of 468-trials, infants grabbed the edges of the
occluder on 185-trials (24.2%), followed the contours of the occluder by gliding their hands on 126-trials (16.4%) and attempted to push or pull-off the occluder on 120-trials (15.7%). A

chi-square test revealed that there was a strong association between the occluder type and

the type of exploratory behaviours made on the occluders (X2 (14) = 99.58, p<.001) with a
small effect size of 0.26 as measured by Cramer's V(see Figure 13). Overall, 43.5% of their
exploratory behaviours occurred under the transparent occluders in comparison to the graded (28.3%) or opaque (28.2%) conditions. In the transparent condition specifically,

infants were more likely to attempt to reach directly for the ball through the occluder (23.7%) and engaged in frequent hand gliding (19.2%). Overall, grasping the curvilinear edges of the occluder was the most common exploratory behaviour across al occluder types (24.4%, 25% and 23.4% in the graded, opaque and transparent conditions respectively).

Peeking. In general, only 174-peeks (37.4%) were made across all occluder types. A threeway loglinear analysis between peeking, occluder-type and hiding-task revealed significant two-way associations (peeking* hiding-task and peeking* occluder type). To further explicate this effect, a separate chi-square test on peeking and hiding tasks revealed that infants were more likely to peek in the five-hiding task (69%) in comparison to the 31% in a

three-hiding task (X2 (1) = 4.53, p<.05). The effect size associated with this relationship as
measured by Phi was 0.10 which suggests a small effect size (see Figure 14, top). A chi-

square test on peeking and occluder-type revealed a significant association (X2 (2) = 114.02,
p<.001) with a medium effect size of 0.50 as measured by Cramer's V(see Figure 14,

bottom). Interestingly, 63.2% of peeking occurred in opaque occluder conditions with 17.2% and 19.5% peeked in the transparent and graded occluder conditions (respectively). A
separate chi-square test also indicated that there was no significant association between

occluder number and peeking (X2 (4) = 0.978, p>.05). Therefore, infants are more likely to
peek when there were increased numbers of hiding locations. Moreover, this behaviour

55

increased under opaque occluder conditions to gain direct visual sight of the ball, whereas

peeking under the transparent and graded occluder conditions was less likely.

Reach-Type. Chi-square tests revealed a significant association between occiuder type and the manner in which infants executed their detour reach around the occiuder to search for

the ball (X2 (8) = 26.48, p<.001) with a small effect size of 0.18 as measured by Cramer's V
(see Table 1). In general, majority of reaches were either right-ipsilateral (31.0%) or rightcontralateral (24.8%). Specifically, under graded occiuder conditions, right-ipsilateral and right-contralateral searches occurred at 34.7% and 25.2% respectively; under transparent
occiuder conditions, majority of infants were more likely to make right-ipsilateral reaches

(37.8%). Lastly, under opaque occiuder conditions, infants were more likely to make right and left-contralateral (awkward) searches at 31.1% and 27.8% respectively. Therefore, a greater proportion of infants made ipsilateral-reaches when full- or partial visual access of
the object was granted, and that awkward or contralateral reaches were more likely when visual information about the object was denied.

The same type of analyses were conducted between occiuder number and search

type, but only the association in five-hiding task was found to be significant (X2 (16) = 59.12,
p<.001), with a small effect size of 0.24 as measured by Cramer's V(see Table 2). The

analysis indicated that a majority of reaches behind the occiuder was once again initiated by the right hand. Interestingly, infants used contralateral or awkward reaches when searching

for the ball at the first or fifth occluders (i.e., extremities of the table). Specifically, at the first

57

occluder (located to the infant's left side), 34.7% of search types were left-contralateral while

at the fifth occluder (located to the infant's right side), and 48.1 % of search types were carried out using a right-contralateral reach. At the second occluder, infants were also more
likely to use left-contralateral reaches (27.5%); searches at midline (third occluder) and

slightly to the right (fourth occluder) were dominated by the right- ipsilateral (33.3%, 42.9%
respectively) and right-contralateral reaches (29.4%, 32.1% respectively). Infants were also more likely to remove the occluder towards at the first (24.5%) and second (23.5%) occluders. Therefore, infants made more awkward (i.e., contralateral reaches) for occluders towards at the end hiding locations, but that ipsilateral reaches were more likely to occur at midline towards the infants' right.

3.5 LEARNING

The study also examined whether performance was better across trials (N=24) for infants who began the study with five-hiding tasks and subsequently completed the threehiding task, in comparison to those who participated in the reversed order of hiding tasks. The difference between the two counter-balanced hiding task groups were conducted based

on only two dependent variable measure (i.e., reach initiation and ball touch) because these
two measures would indicate if infants' performance improved across trials from start to
touching the ball or peg. A repeated measures ANOVA for Trials X Hiding Task Grouping

was conducted. The analyses revealed that the Mauchley's test indicated that the

assumption of sphericity had been violated for trials, therefore degrees of freedom were
corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity (8 = .321). The results of the ANOVA revealed a significant main-effect for trials, F(7.38, 132.79) = 2.57, p<.05, but that there was no significant differences between the groups F(1, 18) = 2.34, p>.05 (see Figures

16 and 17). Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that the first trial (M= 24.16, SE = 2.61) is

60

significantly slower in comparison to the ninth (M= 7.08, SE = 1.26, p<.05), fifteenth (M= 8.46, SE = 2.11, p<.05), sixteenth (M= 8.74, SE = 1.86, p<.05) and twenty-fourth (M= 11.47,
SE = 1.75, p<.05) trials. However the pattern across the trials collapsed across occluder

type, gender and hiding tasks indicates a steep learning curve in the first 9-trials where performance plateaus until the end of the session. In parsing-out the two counter-balanced hiding-task groups, it appears that in general, infants who began with the five-hiding task learned the task faster across trials in comparison to those who began with the three-hiding tasks. Interestingly, when the hiding-task group is switched to a different hiding task (see

filled marker in plot at trial #10 and #3 for groups beginning with three- and five-hiding tasks respectively), a general change in the curve is witnessed indicating a slight change in
learning behaviour. Therefore, infants learn quickly how to search under various occluder

types and hiding task and that regardless of their first experience with a particular hidingtask, both groups follow similar learning curves.

IV. DISCUSSION

First, infants performed impressively in the core task and revealed a remarkably adept motivation to follow, search, and retrieve objects; that is, despite the novel environment and laboratory conditions, the level of task engagement was much higher than expected. Based on the many innovative ways that infants approached the tasks, there was

clear evidence that infants "inhabited" the task and largely "made it their own" which is
important for determining maximum effort and engagement. Almost equally important for

infant studies, the parents were engaged, supportive, and played a vital motivational support role in study. In short, infants demonstrated a very powerful "cognition in action" pattern of behaviour which was not lost on the parents who were very engaged by the research and
underlying questions. Second, the results of this study taken together across different analysis

approaches, successfully document a critical relationship between thinking and moving at 9.5-months of age. That is, as the human infant learns to attend to moving objects that appear in and out of sight, they are actively problem-solving--seeking a best fit action path-- to help them achieve their goals and overcome possible obstacles in their immediate

environments. In the study, visual information about the object was deliberately manipulated
to create a special context where infants were required to search behind clear-transparent, solid-opaque or 50% graded occluders or barriers. Keeping in mind that the visual

manipulations were presented to infants in either three or five possible hiding locations and examined its influences on infants' problem-solving abilities, this discussion section will first review the main results of the current study and provide interpretations of the findings related to these key experimental manipulations. Finally, the organization and coordination of action,
cognition and perception as they relate to the proposed accounts on infant search-task

difficulties are discussed within the context of possible improvements to the current study as
well as a proposal for future direction studies.

63

4.1 GENERAL FINDINGS

While infants performed remarkably well overall, not all infants were successful in
making a detour reach around the occluder to touch the ball and/or to obtain it. In fact, in a majority of trials infants persistently and at times vigorously made numerous attempts to

obtain the ball without any success. Therefore, the dependent measures of initiating a reach
and making contact with the correct occluder were considered to be two of the most informative variables measuring infants true motivation, determination, conceptual understanding and cognitive planning in this search-task.

The results of the current study indicated that infants' reach initiation as well as
contacting the correct occluder was significantly faster when the ball was either partiallyvisible or fully-visible (under graded and transparent occluders respectively) than when it was completely obscured by an opaque occluder. Prior work with infants' reaching for stationary

objects have similarly shown disruptions in reaching when the sight of target was blocked (Ashmead et al., 1993). The analyses of each trial in its entirety, from the time the ball came to its hiding location to the time that the ball was touched, revealed faster contacts under
50% graded occluder conditions. In other words from start to finish, infants' performance in coordinating a detour reach around the occluder to touch the ball was fastest when the

object was only partially-visible. Furthermore on more than half of the trials, infants went
beyond the required criterion of making a detour reach to touch the ball and coordinated a

grasp in order to retrieve it from under the occluder. For these infants, their success was also
greatest under 50% graded conditions. These findings are nicely consistent with Lockman

and Adams (2001) study, where infants were more likely to retrieve the goal-object from around a grid-like barrier than a corresponding transparent barrier. The current research also support Keen and colleagues' (2003) findings that infants' demonstrate greater success in
making less anticipatory reaches and greater success of obtaining the ball under 'window'

conditions where dual-information about the wall (through the occluder) and solidity of the occluder itself were provided). The availability of both information about the occluder and the

competence about hidden objects and can coordinate the appropriate sequence of actions to

search for the target. However, infant's ability to gain new cognitive milestones is dependent
on motor skill and particularly vision; this is not an insignificant comment when viewed against the backdrop of the more traditional approach that views cognition as "driving" action.

The results reported above provide some reinforcing support for this position that is now well established in the developmental literature (cf. Thelen, 2001, 2005; Adolph, 2008). Similarly,
findings from the current study also suggest that object visibility (i.e., the visual object at the center of the child's motivation) plays an important role in shaping cognitive decision-making
and in formulating and executing a reach. Collectively, these points help echo the importance

of the dual power of the perception-action-coupling in development discussed at length at the
outset.

In addressing the scholarly debates on infants' understanding of transparency, the

current study supports arguments from both sides presented earlier. In support of Lockman and colleagues work (1984; 2001), infants in the current study managed to conduct detour reaches around all occluder tunnels but performed more exploratory behaviours around transparent occluders in comparison to any other occluder. However, infants' success of

touching and/or obtaining the ball was more reflective of findings by Shinskey and
colleagues. This latter point requires further explication.

In two studies, (Shinskey, 2002; 2000) 6- and 10-month-olds' search abilities were
tested for objects in milk, water or a "visible-milk" as well as behind transparent, semi-

transparent or opaque curtains where 6-months olds reached, touched and retrieved visibleor partly-visible object more often than when it was fully-hidden; however, 10-month-olds

succeeded under all hiding conditions. These findings support this study's observations that visual information about a goal-object (even if it is partial) is the key factor in how quickly infants process and subsequently act on objects behind barriers. In fact in the current study, once the ball came to rest underneath the opaque occluder, infants appeared to contemplate

about the ball's whereabouts and took more time to 'figure-out' where to launch a search

developmental areas such as in crawling (Berger, 2004), reaching (Needham & Kaufman,

1997), and searching (Berthier, 2002) behavior. Collectively, these authors argue that infants
and adults have limited cognitive resources to attend to the various stimuli in their

environments and must allocate it differentially--especially critical for infants who are continually immersed in learning new ways of acting on their environments. Indeed, neuroimaging research with adults has demonstrated that performing two cognitive tasks simultaneously generates increased activation in the region of the brain associated with the tasks rather than new brain regions being activated (Berger, 2004); thus the brain does not recruit new resources to cope with the increased demands suggesting a

limitation to the available cognitive resources. However, adults are skilled at dividing their
attention to the most relevant stimuli and features in the environment and their motor

coordination is well-practiced. For the infant, everything in their surroundings is new and effectively demands attention for exploration. Even more challenging is the notion that infants are not yet proficient in multi-tasking and have not mastered their reaching skills (particularly important for the task in this study); consequently, infants' cognitive resources or attention
are depleted (or re-allocated elsewhere) faster, in comparison adults. Given the limited pool

of processing resources, increased demands in one perceptual channel (such as vision)
results in compromised performance in another channel (such as cognition). More

specifically, anticipating and planning for goals can compromise action skills that are
required to perform the intended task. Likewise, planning for and deploying (complex or novel) action skills can also compromise the cognitive attention and problem-solving abilities in infants. The 'action-cognition trade-off' hypothesis (Boudreau & Bushnell, 2000) as they termed it, outlines a critical relationship between thinking and perception (i.e. visual or motor) during the rapidly changing sensorimotor period of human development. Therefore according
to this hypothesis, infants' task difficulty can relate to their limited cognitive processing which

in turn leads to a trade-off between action and cognition, such that when either one becomes more difficult (consuming more attention), the other suffers (receiving less attention).

exception of faster performance in touching the correct occluders, the results of this study did not reveal a significant difference in infants' performance in reach initiation, ball touch or any
variability in the types of search errors across hiding tasks. It is important to note however

that once infants are self-propellant and capable of locomotion, there is a rapid increase in their abilities to discriminate among perceptually similar locations and their representations of multiple hiding locations becomes more specialized based on such experiences of selflocomotion (Smith et al., 1999). In this regard, the current findings do not consistently

support the notion that 9.5-month-olds' success or failure was attributed to their lack of spatial knowledge or reasoning provided that all were capable of self-locomoting. It is possible however, that infants performed significantly worse under the opaque condition because continuous sight of the ball (and its trajectory) was interrupted. Indeed,
work with moving targets (as per Berthier et al., 2001; Keen et al., 2003) has revealed that

infants' reaches are disrupted when the object passes behind an opaque barrier such that

infants often fail to anticipate its reemergence. If this is the case, then it would be expected
that when only some information about the ball's trajectory is missing (via the graded

condition), that infants' reach initiation and correct occluder touch would fall between the
performance levels of transparent and opaque occluder conditions. However, the mean response of initiating a reach and touching the correct occluder was fastest under graded

occlusion (see figures 6, 7 and 9). Even though this difference was not statistically significant, the plot patterns suggest that it is highly unlikely that lack of visual information
about the ball's trajectory was the only factor that interfered with infants' response times.

Lack of Object Permanence. These results are also inconsistent with the account that infants do not fully understand the concept of object permanence before 8- to 10-months of
age (Piaget, 1952, 1954). Although infants' displayed significantly more difficulties when the

object was fully-hidden, the fact that 9.5-month-olds ever contacted or retrieved a hidden object from behind opaque occluders suggests that they were aware of the object's

70

presence. These findings in combination with the literature on infants' increased sensitivity
and success in retrieving objects hidden in the dark (Clifton, Perris, & McCall, 1999) and consistent longer looking times demonstrated by VOE paradigm (Baillargeon et al., 1985) do not adequately support the Piagetian account.

Search Error Responses. As previously reviewed in Chapter 1, one key technique for understanding infants' object knowledge and development is by examining their search-error. The findings of the current study revealed that although infants made far fewer errors (14.4%) in comparison to choosing the correct occluders when searching for the ball, the distribution of errors was not entirely at random. Indeed, when infants committed errors, it was often clustered around the correct occluder. Moreover, majority of search errors were conducted at the opaque occluder conditions such that infants most often perseverated to

the previously correct and rewarded hiding locations; however a greater proportion of errors under graded occluders were not perseverative and were conducted at random. Sophian and Yento (1985) have similarly observed comparable behaviours in 9-month-olds' searching
abilities for hidden and visible objects in containers. The authors report that when the object was fully-hidden, errors were more prevalent but also more systematic in that infants were

more likely to perseverate and search in the previously correct hiding location. That said, infants made fewer errors when the object was visible, but that when these errors did occur, they were more random in nature and were not systematically perseverative. These results, in addition to the current findings, indicate that infants' search errors are due to the
combination of weak memory and lack of inhibition.

71

Figure 18: An infant's search error on a five- hiding task with opaque occluders. The infant's search is directed to an immediate hiding location next to the ball. /

Based on the Diamond's well-study (Diamond et al., 1994) the memory demands posed by total occlusion of objects (in multiple-hiding tasks) is too great, causing infants to forget the object's location. But a perseverative search is due to a combination of weak

memory plus inhibition of the pull to reach back to where the toy was previously found. Notwithstanding the above, if infants' difficulty was strictly due to a weak memory, then all
search-errors should have been randomly conducted with no significant pull towards the

previously correct location. There is no evidence in this study to support this contention. In full consideration of the arguments presented, it is not clear why the distribution of
errors under transparent occluders (albeit fewer) even occurred and why some were

perseverative in nature. It was expected that when visual information about the object is
visible, errors should systematically occur at random as there are no conflicting information

between the current and previous hiding locations. Although this pattern is evident in the
graded occlusion, the search pattern for fully-visible objects does not follow this trend. It is

possible that the lack of "visual salience" may have exacerbated the manner and the location at which errors were made. Indeed, all occluder sets in the current study were identical in physical features, size and were not uniquely distinguishable. However, given that very few
errors are committed in the transparent conditions (7-trials in perseverative and 15-trials in

72

random) in comparison the other occluder types, search errors may have simply been due to infants' interest in playing with the occluder rather than a true response bias. The Dynamic Systems Theory (Smith et al., 1999; Thelen, 2000; Thelen & Smith, 1994) accounts for perseverative responses by stating that although in the window from 7- to 12-months infants gradually become skilled reachers, it is not until the end of the first year of life that infants have truly mastered the coordination and organization of a reach sequence to obtain objects. When faced with a difficult and novel reaching task, these reachers try to control their reaches by limiting the degrees of freedom in the movement and with increased motor movements and the repetitions of these highly similar motor patterns, strong motor memories are created in the body (muscles) as well as in the brain. Strong motor memories in turn, make perseveration more likely when the task requires a different direction of movement. In the present study since the hiding locations were equidistant to the infant, it is possible that infants' perseverative responses were due to their engagement in similar motor patterns as DST describes. But it is also worth noting that the ball was continuously hidden at a different location thus infants did not engage in repetitive motor patterns to the same
location on any successive trials. In other words, even though the spatial relation between

the hand and hiding locations are consistent and repetitive in nature, infants are still required to search in novel locations on every trial and do not repeat the specific motor pattern at the same location. Conversely in A-not-B tasks, infants practice the same motor plan to the same location several times (at A) before the location changes (to B). Based on this account,

it is unlikely that DST and its description for motor memory appropriately explains infants'
search errors in this particular search-task. A closely related element to DSTs emphasis on the importance of development and mastery of reaching skills is the Cognitive Load Hypothesis referenced earlier. According to

Boudreau and Bushnell's account (2000), once infants' reaching has becomes a wellpracticed skill, they no longer have to "think about" the execution of their motor act, thereby
allowing more attention to be dedicated to cognitive planning. Therefore, search errors on 73

hidden events occur due to the fact that since attention is the "rate-limiting" factor, infants who have not yet mastered their reaching skills tend to allocate more attention to either a
mental planning act or an actual motor execution act thereby leading to the poor

performance and increase in search error responses. Expressed differently, this model and approach can also explain aspects of the novice-to-expert-shifts frequently reported in
developmental scholarship.
Curiously, one particular reason why search errors in general did not occur as often

as correct responses was partly due to infants' smart and innovative actions to "keep track" of the ball. As the ball travelled across the table, infants engaged in a behaviour that was termed, hand tracking on 24.7% of the trials. That is, infants extended their arm out towards the ball's release point and subsequently followed the ball's trajectory down the ramp and across the table, directly stopping above the occluder where the ball came to rest. The

engagement of this behaviour by some infants was not statistically significant in initiating

faster reaches or touching the correct occluder; nevertheless, it seemed as though infants
used this behaviour to "double-check" or make certain of the ball's motion in addition to visual tracking. It is plausible that infants used this behaviour as a means to lighten the cognitive complexity or to bypass memory weaknesses in forgetting the ball's hiding location as it moved under the occluders. Furthermore, another smart-action that infants deployed was peeking behaviour, particularly in five-hiding tasks and when visual perception of the object was obscured. Under these conditions, infants often peeked underneath 'potential' occluders prior to initiating a reach and other times infants searched for the ball using contra-lateral (or awkward) reaches that naturally invited a peeking response. Interestingly, however, this

behaviour was not exclusive to opaque occluders; rather, under transparent and graded occluders, infants often engaged in full-body leans or peeks towards the opening-side of the
occluders as they reached for the ball. Essentially, leaning and peeking under transparent

and graded conditions is visually guided reaching. As reviewed in Chapter 1, infants (and
74

even adults) utilize visually guided reaches in tasks that require precision, where the sight of the hand and target in the same field become crucial factors in making immediate and 'online' motor adjustments (Bushnell, 1985).

Figure 19: Infants' Peeking Behaviours in five-hiding tasks. (Left): Infant peeking under opaque occluder prior to initiating a reach. (Centre): Infant peeking and making a right contralateral reach under opaque occluder. (Right): Infant peeking under graded occluder.

In other works, Diamond (1990, 1991) has observed that 6.5-months olds can retrieve a toy inside a transparent box only if the toy is seen through the opening of the box. The author notes that by 8.5- to-9-months, infants bend down to gain direct visual sight of the object when they reach into a front opening and by 9.5- to-10-months, they continue in the same strategy of leaning and looking into the opening when retrieving an object from left or right-side openings. Still, it is not until 11- to-12-months of age when the vision and reaching
can be broken.

Exploratory Behaviours. The lack of inhibition was further observed in the current study with other exploratory behaviours around the occluders. Consistent with previous findings by Lockman (2001; 1984), nearly half of the exploratory behaviours were conducted around

transparent barriers where infants often followed the contours of the occluder and attempted
to reach directly through-not-around the occluder in order to obtain the ball.

Figure 20: Infants' direct reaching attempts through transparent occluder types.

The behaviour of reaching through transparent occluders is not a peculiar behaviour, but an amusing one to observe, as infants persistently attempt to reach directly for the ball
while their hand continuously collides with the occluder. Even adults often "walk through"

glass doors and clear-transparent walls despite their extensive experience with these types of materials. Therefore, it is possible that infants simply do not notice the occluder's
presence when they are intensely engaged in obtaining the object. The current study particularly made certain to construct the occluders such that more information would be available in the infant's visual field at any one time. Specifically, the smaller sizes of the occluders meant that both edges of the occluder were available in the infant's perceptual field, which ultimately serves as an important visual cue regarding the occluder's boundaries. The direct reaching attempts for the ball can also be attributed to infants' inability to inhibit the prepotent direct reaching response. Similar to peeking behaviours, action at this age (or with this particular search task) may be so heavily dependent on perceptual information to guide action that infants lack inhibitory control to resist a direct reach in the

i

direction they are looking. In other words, successful performance in search tasks behind transparent barriers is closely linked to success in inhibiting a direct reach. As previously
cited in Chapter 1, such performance deficits have similarly been shown in infant monkeys with lesions in the prefrontal cortex whereas those monkeys without lesions, with lesions only in the parietal cortex, or with lesions only in the hippocampal region of the brain, do not make

direct reaching attempts or perseverative responses on reaching tasks (Diamond, 1990).

76

This inter-species comparison highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in regulating attention and reducing distractibility from the salient goal (behind transparency) in order to successfully take into account the larger context and consider other routes to the achieving the goal.

In another interesting observation that is relevant to the current findings, infants frequently hit their hands to the side of the occluder's edge but did not do so in an intentional
manner to explore the occluder. A study using bi-directional reaching reported similar

observations on (7-month old) infants' difficulty in getting to the target 'cleanly' without accidental touches to the edges of the occluder en route to their goal (Diamond & Lee, 2000).

Figure 21: Infants' corrected reaching attempts.

Such corrected reaching (or "clumsy" reaching) was evident across all occluder types

as infants exclusively focused on the goal and appeared to ignore the manner in which their reaching arm and hand approached the occluder. This finding is in agreement with Diamond (1991) and Lockman's (1984; 2001) views that seeing the goal is distracting to how infants plan a detour reach; but at the same time, visual feedback from the target is what seems to be driving search-behaviours in the first place. Moreover, it has been suggested that the
mapping between vision and proprioception is well coordinated by 8-months of age (Carrico & Berthier, 2008), but the current study's observations of 9.5-month-olds' hand coordination

seems to indicate that a rough mapping between the two systems still seems to exist.

77

Perhaps "clumsy" reaching occurs because once again the line of sight is so powerful that even feedback from tactile information provided by the occluder is ignored.
When an adult's hand grazes a neighboring object, they simply continue on to the goal-

object. However, once the infants in the current study made contact with a curvilinear edge of the occluder, their fingers were often 'caught' on the edge of the occluder or they reacted

in grasping the edge with their palm or fingers. Diamond and Lee (2000) have suggested that
9.5-month-olds exhibit a difficulty in inhibiting a grasp which is thought to be deeply rooted in the reflexive reactions of the hand (i.e., grasping reflex). Although these reflexes are not the sole cause of infants' difficulty in making a detour (or bi-directional) reach, it nevertheless provides a small window into the unique challenges infants face of inhibiting primitive reflexes. This observation in particular sheds light on the complexity of executing and

coordinating a detour reach and the importance of avoiding the obstacle itself when it is
contiguous with the goal-object. Taken as a whole, these findings shed light on the close

pairing of vision and reaching as well as emphasizing the importance of the sight of the
target-object and the hand in guiding action and motor control.

Even though this study was not intended to investigate infants' success of learning this task, it is very impressive that infants at this age are able to solve such advanced problems and display one of the most important characteristics of human intelligence and knowledge. It is particularly fascinating to witness infants' learning of a novel and demanding task in a matter of minutes. These observations have been previously documented, where infants younger than 12-months of age are able to exhibit planned and purposeful solutions
to problem-solve in search tasks (Willatts, 1984). Indeed, infants' short-term experience over

the course of one session resulted in certain forms of exploratory behaviours to decrease particularly direct reaches through transparent occluders. Additionally, on many individual reaching trials in the current study, infants displayed variability in their reaching strategies

and attempted to reach through the occluder and detour around it as well (see also Lockman & Adams 2001). Overall, infants engaged in the task, but they learned and improved on their

abilities to detour around barriers and search for visible- hidden- and partially-hidden objects. In this light, it is important to make clear that infants did not simply "fail" with any particular occluder type or hiding-task; rather infants merely demonstrated differential performance
times and behaviours (often unique and innovative in form) when faced with various manipulations that are only reflective of how infants integrate, process and subsequently choose to act.

4.3 LIMITATIONS AND LOOKING AHEAD In the current study, on nearly every trial infants correctly tracked the ball from its release point down the track and underneath an occluder. They often demonstrated impressive prospective control by engaging in a smart-action we termed hand tracking, where the path of the ball was followed as it moved across the table. Though infants touched and often succeeded in obtaining the ball, it is difficult to isolate how visual information was processed once the ball came to rest underneath a tunnel. That is, despite impressive anticipatory eye and hand tracking abilities, it is not clear what information (i.e., the ball, the occluder's edge, the occluder's surface etc.) precisely guided infants in planning and subsequently executing a motor action. As one of the limitations of the current study, the use of a corneal reflection eye-tracking system would have effectively revealed this information.

After all, a part of infants' perseverative and random search errors (particularly under opaque
conditions) may have been due to a break in gaze fixation on the correct hiding location, a notion that Butler et al., (2002) eluded to in their search study with toddlers. The study also did not take into account how various infant-mother attachment styles

and socio-cultural differences may have produced varying performance outcomes. As
previously presented, the ethnicity of this sample was not diverse enough to conduct analyses on how performance differed. However, there is a strong literature supporting the notion that mother-infant attachment styles influence infants' cognitive development (see
Donovan, Leavitt, Taylor, & Broader, 2007). In this regard, the study also did not adequately

79

account and control for how much social reward and encouragement mother and the

experimenter provided to infant individually. Though mothers never gestured or overtly pointed to the ball's hiding location, they did often--but inadvertently--verbally inform their children where the ball was hidden. However, it is not believed that this factor would have

contributed to infants' differential search success. By examining infants' behaviours in the current study, there are still some
unanswered questions that require further investigations as well. Infants in the current study engaged in more exploratory behaviours with transparent occluders in comparison to graded or opaque occluders. Naturally, these extensive explorations in the transparent condition consumed much of infants' time in quickly touching the ball and lead to a slower performance time in comparison to the other conditions. Indeed, Yates and Bremner (1988) have showed that increased exploration with transparent barriers may be due to their distracting effects of novelty that are puzzling for infants. The authors noted that familiarizing infants with the

occluders reduces these effects and decreases search errors at the wrong location. It is
possible to investigate these findings with the current study in order to understand how

familiarization with the occluder types would affected the results. In so doing, however, the
novelty and exploration that are the core component of infants' behaviours and characteristics is no longer captured. Furthermore, infants improved performance and success after such exposures with the task would not be surprising; after all, infants clearly demonstrated this advantage through their rapid learning of the task only after 9-exposures (i.e., trials). With regards to the current accounts of infants' search-task abilities, the current

study was not able to definitively exclude the means-end deficit as a limitation factor. Therefore, a comparative study should be conducted whereby infants are required to perform
a means-end task (i.e., remove the occluder in order to obtain the target) with each combination of occluder type and hiding-task. Such means-end task difficulties are more

screen with a tinted Plexiglas screen, while the four doors remained opaque. The authors

argued that if toddlers' difficulties with search tasks are due to lack of visuo-spatial knowledge, then the additive information about the ball's trajectory rolling between the doors as well as its failure to re-emerge from behind the door with the wall, would serve as cues and improve search abilities in toddlers. This manipulation is very similar and comparable to the opaque conditions in the current study; however, 2-year-olds were still unsuccessful in choosing the correct door. Comparatively, the current study's findings revealed that although infants' performance was slower when the ball was fully hidden in comparison to the other occluder conditions, infants were nonetheless successful in touching and obtaining the ball while under full visual occlusion. Therefore, a future direction for this research would be to conduct a study that would attempt to address the perplexing discrepancy in the development of object knowledge between 9.5 months and 24 months of age.

study. With infants showing greater success in touching and obtaining the ball under the

50% graded occluder condition, the present study illustrates the delicate nature and balance
of infants' attention and cognitive capacities while processing visual information for goaltarget search. In other words, information about the solidity of the occlude, as well as visual

sight of the ball, reduced infants' cognitive processing load thereby enabling infants to
dedicate more attention and resources to successfully coordinate a reach around the barrier. When cognitive resources are depleted due to competing mental (i.e., cognitive
planning and problem-solving) or physical (i.e., planning and coordinating motor actions)

demands, infants are not able to inhibit distracting information and divert their attention appropriately to avoid errors and successfully obtain their goal-target objectives. This study also makes important methodological contributions to the field by

emulating infants' natural environments where objects often appear in-and-out of sight and

immersing the infant at its centre. That is, while developed under controlled laboratory

conditions, the approach taken in this study was ecologically sensitive and thus may allow us
to extend the range the findings. In addition, this is the first study to have simultaneously manipulated both cognitive complexities and perceptual information in this type of problemsolving context to demonstrate the tight coupling of action and perception and its role in

shaping cognition. The findings further highlight 9.5-month-olds' impressive ability to focus
on a goal, initiate a mental plan of action and subsequently execute an appropriate motor

action, thereby illustrating how problem-solving abilities in adults is deeply rooted in infancy.
Embedded in this account is the close interaction between the perception action

systems that provides a context in development for demonstrating the complex trade-offs between these systems which ultimately allow infants to successfully engage their world of objects. Visual information from the target, sight of hand and the occluder were all crucial components in infants' success of making precise detour reaches. Infants were greatly
advantaged by having visual sight of the object (partial or full) when planning a course of

action. Visual connection with the target was so powerful in guiding action that infants often "
84

failed to pay attention to the proprioceptive feedback from their reaching arm such that their
hand would often collide with the occluder. Infants were incredibly goal-driven in planning a

detour reach and their engagement in the task was evident in their leaning and peeking behaviours through the occluder openings that truly reflects on their smart-action planning
and problem-solving abilities.

The multiple strategies infants employed over a short period of time are indicative of infants' nature as active explorers, persistently approaching the problem for solutions. Through these exploratory efforts, learning was the ultimate goal for the infant who learned
to exploit perceptual and cognitive information in making appropriate (and smart) motor

actions, which in turn help shape and define the cognitive architecture of early development.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

The purpose of the study is to help us understand babies abilities to coordinate their action to reach and
search for objects hidden behind barriers.

PROCEDURE INVOLVED IN THE STUDY Your baby will sit on your lap in front of a testing table. A small attractive ball will roll down a track, appearing in and out-of-sight as it moves behind a series of small partitions. Your baby will be searching

for the moving ball at various locations on the track. We are interested in measuring your child's abilities in planning her/his reach towards the ball's location and searching for it once it has disappeared out-ofsight. There are no right or wrong answers. Sometimes infants are very interested and successful in reaching and searching for objects, sometimes they are not interested or successful. Both of these are normal responses and do not say anything about your child's development. We ask that you sit quietly during the observation periods when your baby is engaged in reaching and searching for the ball. However, after each toy retrieval trial, we encourage you to interact with your baby and provide social reward. The entire session should last approximately 30-minutes. All materials are designed and built to be infant safe with smooth rounded edges, carpeted surfaces, and the use of non-toxic paint. All toys are sterilized with a baby-safe cleaning agent after each session with an individual infant.
POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS There are no risks associated with this study. Occasionally, infants may feel uncomfortable, tired or lose interest during the observation and display fussiness. Your participation is voluntary. You are free to take a break to address any special needs your infant may have (i.e. feeding etc.) or you may choose to discontinue your infant's participation at any time during the study session with no consequences. We hope that you and your child will find participating to be an enjoyable experience. Although the research

will not provide meaningful information about your child's individual development, your generous participation will be crucial in our understanding of infant's normal development from 8-to-12 months.
CONFIDENTIALITY

Any information that is obtained in connection with this study, including the information you provide in the questionnaire, will remain strictly confidential. Your privacy and that of your infant will be respected. All records will be referred to in the study using pseudonyms and study codes which will be securely stored on password-protected media. The questionnaires and any other hard copy information pertaining to this study will be stored in a separate locked filing cabinet from the consent forms in the laboratory. Sessions are video-taped in order to allow the researcher to examine the records of observations at a future date. All still-photographs and video-recordings will be used strictly for research purposes and can only be accessed by those directly involved in the study. These images, like the rest of your child's information,

87

are stored separately from information identifying your child. Should you at any time wish not to be
contacted for future studies, please tell a member of the lab, and we will be happy to remove your name from contact list. PARTICIPATION

Your participation is voluntary. You are not under any obligation to answer any questions. If at any time you wish to withdraw from this study and session, you may do so without any consequences by simply notifying the experimenter. You also have the option of removing your infant's records of observation from
the study.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE STUDY

We hope that you are interested in the research and we will be happy to answer any further questions you might have about it at any time. If you wish to be informed about the results of this study, please leave your phone number and/or e-mail address and you will be contacted upon the completion of this project. If you do not wish to be contacted and are still interested in the results of the study then you may obtain information about the results by contacting us.
