ABSTRACT  
Participatory  Mapping  of  Regional  Food  Assets  using     Volunteered  Geographic  Information  Systems   Degree:  PhD,  Environmental  Applied  Science  and  Management   Year  and  Institution:  2015,  Ryerson  University                                         Name  of  Graduate:  Victoria  Fast   Local   food   systems   are   increasingly   being   studied   in   response   to   the   threats   imposed  on  global  agri-industrial  food  systems.  Central  to  local  food  is  the  community  who   is   imagining   and   implementing   diverse   and   hyper-local   food   assets,   which   are   making   a   significant,   but   largely   unknown,   contribution   to   food   security,   resiliency,   and   sustainability.   It   is   important   to   align   these   assets   with   broader   regional   food   policies,   programs,  and  regulations.  However,  there  are  few  mechanisms  to  engage  stakeholders  or   share   local   information.   One   possible   mechanism   to   learn   about   local   food   assets   is   volunteered   geographic   information   (VGI);   a   phenomenon   that   blends   crowdsourcing,   citizen   science,   and   online   mapping.   It   is   currently   being   studied   for   its   ability   to   engage   and  gather  information  from  diverse  and  under-represented  groups.   This  policy-relevant  research  investigates   how   VGI   can   support  greater   engagement   and   knowledge   sharing   across   diverse   food   stakeholders.   To   achieve   this   objective,   the   VGI   system   framework   is   established   to   study   the   processes   that   support   the   creation   of   VGI.   Next,  the  new  era  of  food  mapping,  dubbed  Food  Mapping  2.0,  is  investigated  to  understand   the   impact   evolving   mapping   techniques   have   on   the   engagement   of   food   stakeholders.   Lastly,   the   VGI   systems   framework,   which   is   embedded   in   participatory   geographic   information   system   and   participatory   action   research   methods,   is   applied   to   support   participatory  mapping  of  regional  food  assets  in  Durham  Region.   This  research  gathered  contributions  on  over  200  food  assets  in  Durham  Region-- an   upper-tier   municipality   just   east   of   Toronto   consisting   of   eight   lower-tier   municipalities--effectively   capturing   the   distributed   intelligence   of   government,   not-for- profit,   and   community   stakeholders.   The   crowdsourced   data   include   locations,   descriptions,   and   media   related   to   farms,   markets,   community   gardens,   foodscapes,   and

   other   innovative   food   assets.   The   community   identified   urban   food   assets   as   a   central   strength  of  the  regional  food  system.  Overall,  this  project  enabled  the  creation  of  an  open   food  assets  dataset,   further  supporting  the  development  of  an  online  Food  Assets  map  and   a  Crowdsourcing  Urban  Food  Assets  report,  which  are  collective  used  to  inform  future  food   policy,   regulation,   and   program   development.   Overall,   this   research   revealed   a   uniquely   local   and   community-driven   perspective   about   food   system   assets   within   Durham,   while   serving  as  a  prototype  of  the  VGI  systems  framework.

Food   systems   are   essential   to   everyday   life,   providing   nourishment   for   a   growing   population.   However,   food   systems   are   vulnerable   to   the   threats   posed   by   a   changing   climate,   population   pressures,   the   shift   to   urban   living,   and   the   loss   of   productive   agricultural   land   (Hoffmann,   2013).   Further,   there   is   growing   evidence   that   the   current   food  system  is  inequitable,  unsustainable,  not  producing  a  healthy  diet  for  the  population   (Scharf,  Levkoe,  &  Saul,  2010).  These  threats  highlight  the  need  for  adaptive  strategies  to   build   more   resilient   food   systems.   Local   food   systems   are   increasingly   being   studied   and   implemented   as   a   part   of   the   solution   to   make   food   systems   more   resilient,   sustainable,   secure,  and  just.   Local   food   systems   are   hard   to   concretely   define,   and   encompass   many   variations   (Hincrichs,  2003).  Local  food  systems  represent  the  actions  of  community  groups  (Levkoe,   2011),   municipalities   (Deloitte,   2013),   provinces   (Baker,   Campsie,   &   Rabinowicz,   2010),   and   even   the   actions   of   nations   (Levkoe,   Bebee,   Wakefield,   Castel,   &   Dávila,   2012).   The   term  equally  encompasses  the  100-mile  diet  and  the  100-metre  diet  (Morrison,  Nelson,  &   Ostry,   2011;   L.   Newman   &   Dale,   2009);   the   difference   between   food   grown   in   the   region   of   consumption   versus   food   grow   in   backyard   gardens.   The   initiatives   within   the   broad   spectrum  of  local  food  consist  of  many  diverse  and  hyper-local  places  of  food  production,   sharing,   and   consumption,   which   are   contributing   a   sizable,   but   largely   unmeasured,   amount  of  food  to  communities.   When   it   comes   to   food   system   planning,   Clancy   &   Ruhf   (2010)   ask:   "Is   local   enough?"   They   assert   that   regional   food   systems   are   more   concretely   defined,   and   have   greater   economic,   policy,   and   program   development   capacities   than   local   food   systems   alone.  In  Canada,  regional  municipalities  operate  below  the  province  and  above  cities  and   towns,   and   have   jurisdictional   authority   over   local   food   systems;   decision-makers   are      1  

   responsible   for   undertakings   such   as   land   use   planning,   food   policies,   and   supply   chain   management  (Baker  et  al.,  2010;  Feagan,  2007).  Food  hubs  are  a  prominent  example  of  a   regional  food  system  jurisdiction,  which  aims  to  foster  regional  distribution  and  purchasing   for  both  wholesale  and  retail  purposes  (Mount  &  Andrée,  2013).     There   are   many   stakeholders   operating   within   the   regional   food   system,   including   government,  not-for-profit  organizations,  businesses,  researchers,  community  groups,  and   civil   society.   There   are   also   many   food   assets   contained   within   the   regional   food   system,   encompassing  urban  and  rural  interests.  Urban  food  assets  typically  manifest  themselves  at   a   municipal   scale   or   smaller,   and   are   often   labeled   urban   agriculture   (Macias,   2008;   Pothukuchi,  Joseph,  Burton,  &  Fisher,  2002;  Scharf  et  al.,  2010).  Related  activities  include   establishing   and   maintaining   community   gardens,   hosting   food-related   events,   and   promoting   food   literacy   through   workshops   (Deloitte,   2013).   Rural   food   assets   typically   focus  on  the  more  traditional  farms,  encompassing  production,  distribution,  and  processing   resources.   Regional   food   systems   have   the   potential   to   enact   the   greatest   change   to   the   food   system,   as   the   decision-makers   within   are   able   to   adapt   to   the   local   environment   and   respond   to   the   unique   needs   of   the   urban   and   rural   factions.   In   order   to   strengthen   the   capacity  of  regional  food  systems,  there  is  a  call  for  better  connections  across  the  spectrum   of   food   system   stakeholders   and   a   need   to   understand   the   local   context   (Dubbeling,   Hoekstra,  Renting,  Carey,  &  Wiskerke,  2015;  Rural  Economic  Development  Program,  2013).   To   this   end,   an   important   step   to   catalyzing   change   in   the   regional   food   system   is   to   convene  the  wide  range  of  food  stakeholders  who  are  active  in  regional  food  systems  and   create   a   detailed   understanding   of   food   assets.   This   stakeholder   engagement   and   data   on   food   assets   in   the   region   can   then   be   used   to   support   the   development   of   locally   appropriate,  innovative,  and  inclusive  (multi-sector)  food  policies.

1.2  Turning  toward  Volunteered  Geographic  Information  
Digital   and   Web   technologies   have   been   identified   as   a   prospective,   yet   currently   underdeveloped,   avenue   to   support   engagement   and   data   creation   within   regional   food   systems   (Bill   36,   2013;   Rural   Economic   Development   Program,   2013).   While   there   are   currently  few  mechanisms  to  report  food  assets,  volunteered  geographic  information  (VGI)   could   support   greater   engagement   and   knowledge   sharing   across   diverse   people   and   subjects.  Part  of  the  broader  phenomenon  of  crowdsourcing  (Brabham,  2009),  VGI  refers  to   user-generated   contributions   that   contain   a   location   component   (Goodchild,   2007;   Sui,   Elwood,   &   Goodchild,   2013).   In   fact,   individuals   create,   share,   and   use   various   forms   of   VGI   near  daily.   Currently,   there   are   various   types   of   VGI.   Footprint   VGI   refers   to   information   containing   location   attributes   (e.g.,   latitude/longitude,   address)   that   the   public   unknowingly   contributes   when   they   are   interacting   with   common   processes   (e.g.,   retail   point   of   sale)   or   applications   (e.g.,   location-enabled   smart   phones).   Rabari   &   Storper   (2014)   refer   to   this   as   the   digital   skin   of   cities   and   relate   it   to   big   data,   suggesting   that   urban  environments  are  turning  into  information  factories.  Examples  include  tracking  the   location   of   credit   card   purchases,   which   can   be   used   to   help   banks   identify   fraudulent   credit   card   behaviour   or   track   purchasing   behaviours   for   future   marketing   purposes.   Beyond  this  introduction,  this  research  does  not  employ  footprint  VGI.   Passive   VGI   refers   to   information,   again   containing   location   attributes,   that   the   public  are  knowingly  producing  but  they  are  not  intending  the  information  to  be  used  for   further   (spatial)   analysis.   For   example,   individuals   using   Twitter   to   tweet   about   #LocalFood   do   not   intend   for   their   data   to   be   used   to   map   the   hashtag   #LocalFood   around   the   Greater   Toronto   Area   (Figure   1.1).   Passive   VGI   is   more   closely   associated   with   the   initial  `citizen  as  sensors'  conceptualization  of  VGI,  introduced  by  Goodchild  (2007).  Since   the   inception   of   VGI   in   2007,   there   has   been   a   profound   transformation   in   how   VGI   is   created,  distributed,  and  consumed  (Sui  et  al.,  2013).            3

The   last   type   of   VGI   is   active   contributions,   where   the   public   knowingly   and   intentionally   contribute   information   for   the   purpose   of   the   project   (Haklay,   2013a).   This   type   of   VGI   is   often   collected   in   citizen   science   projects   where   the   public   is   engaged   to   actively   contribute   to   various   aspects   of   scientific   research,   such   as   employing   hikers   to   monitor   alpine   plant   life   cycles   in   New   Hampshire   mountains   (Wiggins   &   Crowston,   2015).   Within  the  geographic  realm,  there  has   been  substantial  progress  in  participatory  mapping   methods   directed   at   collecting   active   VGI   from   a   range   of   citizens   and   stakeholders   who   are,  in  some  cases,  also  involved  in  project  development  (Haklay,  2013a).     This   type   of   participatory   mapping   is   creating   space   for   dialogue   among   many   diverse  actors.  The  public  engagement  enabled  by  VGI,  and  crowdsourcing  more  broadly,  is   unprecedented   and   continues   to   expand.   This   engagement   has   been   shown   to   lead   to   meaningful   public   contributions   in   both   science   and   policy   realms.   For   example,   there   is   evidence   that   active   VGI   has   engaged   the   public   to   create   relevant   data   related   to   the   monitoring   forest   disease   (Connors,   Lei,   &   Kelly,   2012),   report   outdoor   skating   rink   conditions  as  a  proxy  for  winter  weather  trends  (Lawrence,  Robertson,  &  McLeman,  2013),   and   discuss   sustainable   neighbourhood   planning   with   the   urban   community   (Rinner   &   Bird,   2009).   Further,   VGI   is   increasingly   being   used   by   government   to   support   evidence- based  decision-making  (Johnson  &  Sieber,  2012a,  2012b;  Vaz  &  Arsanjani,  2015).

1.3  VGI  and  Food  Asset  Mapping  
Currently,  there  are  few  known  examples  of  VGI  being  applied  to  map  food  systems.   OpenStreetMap   (OSM),   designed   to   crowdsource   mapping   the   world,   has   been   incredibly   successful  at  generating  active  VGI  related  to  features  and  assets  on  the  earth's  surface.  It   has   been   most   notably   used   in   instances   where   authoritative   base   data   are   non-existent,   out   of   date,   financially   inaccessible,   or   lack   detail   (Neis   &   Zielstra,   2014).   However,   the   focus   of   OSM   contributions   is   on   physical   features   on   the   earth's   surface   that   can   be   represented   using   static   geographic   data,   such   as   points,   lines,   and   polygons,   and   simple   attributes  (e.g.,  type  of  object  or  name).  Examples  of  food-related  assets  that  are  included  in   OSM  are  restaurants,  cafes,  and  other  food  vendors.   OpenStreetMap   does   not   include   the   many   diverse   and   hyper-local   food   places   because   they   are   not   permanent   fixtures   on   the   earth's   surface.   These   provisional   food   assets,   which   are   central   to   the   regional   food   system,   include   pop-up   farmers'   markets,   community   gardens,   and   seed   swaps   that   typically   occur   before   or   during   the   growing   season,   rather   than   year   round.   While   recent   OSM   efforts   have   been   dedicated   to   placing   some   of   the   temporary   places   of   food   on   the   map,   such   as   institutionalized   farmers'   markets   and   well-established   community   gardens,   many   food   assets   remain   under- represented   or   entirely   missing   from   OSM.   I   suspect   that   active   VGI   has   the   potential   to   support  greater  engagement  and  knowledge  sharing  within  regional  food  systems.  

1.4  Research  Objective  
The   purpose   of   this   research   is   to   investigate   how   VGI   can   be   used   to   engage   a   wide   range  of  food  system  stakeholders  in  order  to  add  local  information  to  the  broader  regional   food   policy   arena.   To   achieve   this   objective,   the   following   three   interrelated   research   questions  are  addressed  in  this  thesis.   Research  question  1:  What  processes  support  the  creation  of  VGI?     Research  question  2:  How  has  mapping  been  used  to  support  food  systems,  and  what  is   the  impact  of  mapping  on  the  engagement  of  food  system  stakeholders?   Research  question  3:  Applying  a  VGI  systems  approach,  what  does  VGI  contribute  to   Durham's  food  system  and  its  stakeholders?      5  

   Overall,   these   interrelated   research   questions   guide   the   development   and   deployment   of   the   Durham   Food   Map,   a   participatory   map   of   location-based   food   assets   created   using   a   VGI   systems   approach.   This   policy-relevant   research   aims   to   inform   our   understanding  of  the  assets  by  engaging  stakeholders  within  the  local  food  system  in  order   to   improve   Durham's   regional   food   system.   Further,   the   map   is   intended   to   leverage   stakeholders'   knowledge   to   increase   the   transparency   and   accessibility   of   information   on   the  regional  food  system.  

1.5  Outline  of  Chapters  and  Authorship  Statement  
The   research   in   this   dissertation   is   organized   into   six   chapters   (Figure   1.2).   Following   this   introduction,   the   foundational   work   is   presented   in   Chapters   2   and   3.   Chapter   2   addresses   research   question   one   by   establishing   the   VGI   systems   framework,   which   is   then   used   as   the   conceptual   framework   for   the   research   study.   Chapter   3,   addressing   research   question   two,   assesses   how   food   system   mapping   has   been   used   to   support   knowledge   sharing   and   its   impact   on   engagement.   Building   on   the   work   in   Chapters  2  and  3,  research  question  three  is  presented  in  Chapters  4  and  5.  In  this  section   of   the   thesis,   the   VGI   systems   framework   is   applied   to   supporting   regional   food   mapping   and   food   stakeholder   engagement   in   Durham   Region.   Lastly,   Chapter   6   wraps   up   the   dissertation  with  a  series  of  lessons  relevant  to  the  burgeoning  VGI  field.   The  thesis  has  been  written  in  a  combination  of  manuscript-style  (chapters  2  and  3)   and   traditional   style   (chapter   1,   4,   5,   and   6),   as   permitted   by   the   guidelines   of   the   graduate   program.  The  remainder  of  the  thesis  consists  of  the  following  chapters.

   Chapter   3,   entitled   Food   Mapping   2.0:   Climbing   the   Ladder   of   Stakeholder   Engagement,   explores   rapidly   evolving   mapping   technologies   have   been   applied   to   communicating  the  intricacies  of  complex  food  systems.  Recent  advancements  in  mapping   are   presented,   using   a   ladder   of   engagement   to   highlight   the   visualization,   collaboration,   interaction,   and   participation   capacities   currently   used   in   food   system   mapping.   While   many   projects   achieve   visualization   and   collaboration   using   GIS   and   data   sharing,   interaction   and   participation   using   the   Geoweb   and   VGI   can   be   a   potentially   underdeveloped   resource   to   support   community   and   knowledge   sharing   to   build   a   sustainable   and   resilient  food   system.   Authorship  statement:   Victoria   Fast   wrote   Chapter   3  as  a  single-author  manuscript  for  submission  as  a  review  paper.     The   methods   developed   in   Chapter   4,   Building   the   Durham   Food   Map   using   VGI   Systems,   establish   the   process   of   creating   a   VGI   system   to   support   the   participatory   mapping   of   Durham's   local   food   assets.   They   are   rooted   in   participatory   methods,   blending   active   participant   observation   with   participatory   geographic   information   systems   to   maximize   the   involvement   of   the   researcher   and   the   regional   food   community,   respectively.   The   methods   adhere   to   the   components   and   functions   of   VGI   systems   established   in   Chapter   2,   providing   details   on   the   project,   participants,   Geoweb,   and   VGI   components   and   the   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation   functions   supporting   the  creation  of  the  Durham  Food  Map.  Authorship  statement:  Victoria  Fast  wrote  Chapter   4  in  traditional  thesis  style  for  subsequent  revision  towards  publication.     Chapter   5,   Reporting   Food   Assets   in   Durham   Region,   presents   the   findings   and   outcomes   of   implementing   a   VGI   system   to   support   the   participatory   mapping   of   Durham's   regional   food   assets.   First,   the   process   of   establishing   the   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation  functions  are  reported.  Emerging  from  this  project  is  the  food  assets  dataset   generated   by   the   food   community   in   Durham   Region.   This   dataset   enabled   the   development  of  an  online  interactive  map  on  Food  Assets  in  Durham  Region.  Further,  this   project   enabled   the   development   of   the   Crowdsourcing   Urban   Food   Assets   report,   prepared   as   a   white   paper   for   the   Durham   Food   Policy   Council.   These   resources   are   informing   current   and   ongoing   discussions   and   policy   development   aimed   at   strengthen   the   regional   food   system.   The   discussion   elaborates   on   the   engagement   of   the   various      8  

   stakeholder   groups,   including   the   regional   food   community   and   the   project   intermediary.   Overall,   this   research   served   as   a   case   study   to   test   the   VGI   system   framework,   while   contributing   new   information   about   assets   operating   in   Durham's   Regional   food   system.   Authorship   statement:   Victoria   Fast   wrote   Chapter   5   in   traditional   thesis   style   for   subsequent  revision  towards  publication.     The  final  Chapter  6,  Conclusion:  Learning  from  VGI  Systems,  summarizes  the  research   results,  discusses  progress  made  toward  answering  the  research  questions,  and  considers   the   overall   research   goal.   The   bulk   of   this   chapter   concludes   with   a   series   of   reflections,   lessons  learned,  and  areas  for  future  research,  focussing  on  VGI  and  Geoweb  considerations   that   warrant   further   attention.   Authorship   statement:   Victoria   Fast   wrote   Chapter   6   in   traditional   thesis   style,   where   the   ideas   within   are   direction   for   both   future   work   and   publication.

2.  A  SYSTEMS  PERSPECTIVE  ON  VOLUNTEERED  GEOGRAPHIC  INFORMATION  

   Abstract   Volunteered   geographic   information   (VGI)   is   geographic   information   collected   by   way   of   crowdsourcing.   However,   the   distinction   between   VGI   as   an   information   product   and   the   processes  that  create  VGI  is  blurred.  Clearly,  the  environment  that  influences  the  creation   of  VGI  is  different  than  the  information  product  itself,  yet  most  literature  treats  these  as  the   same.   Thus,   this   research   is   motivated   by   the   need   to   formalize   and   standardize   the   systems  that  support  the  creation  of  VGI.  To  this  end,  we  propose  a  conceptual  framework   for   VGI   systems,   the   main   components   of   which--project,   participants,   and   technical   infrastructure--form   an   environment   conducive   to   the   creation   of   VGI.   Drawing   on   examples   from   OpenStreetMap,   Ushahidi,   and   RinkWatch,   we   illustrate   the   pragmatic   relevance  of  these  components.  Applying  a  systems  perspective  to  VGI  allows  us  to  better   understand  the  components  and  functionality  needed  to  effectively  create  VGI.   Keywords:   crowdsourcing;   geographic   information   science;   geographic   information   systems;   Geoweb;   public   participation   GIS;   systems   science;   volunteered   geographic   information  

  

2.1  Introduction  
The   geospatial   Web   2.0,   or   Geoweb   for   short,   is   a   collection   of   online   location- enabled   services   and   infrastructure   that   is   engaging   a   wide   range   of   stakeholders   in   mapping   processes.   The   interactions   between   individuals   and   groups   with   the   Geoweb   environment   is,   in   some   instances,   generating   volunteered   geographic   information   (VGI).   Simply  defined,  "VGI  is  crowdsourced  geographic  information  provided  by  a  wide  range  of   participants   with   varying   levels   of   education,   knowledge,   and   skills"   (Haklay,   Antoniou,      10  

   Basiouka,   Soden,   &   Mooney,   2014,   p.   8).   This   type   of   geographic   information,   or   geo- information,   derived   from   the   public   through   active   or   passive   engagement   is   part   of   the   larger  phenomenon  of  user  generated  or  crowdsourced  content  (Goodchild,  2007),  and  is   producing  novel,  and  often  valuable,  sources  of  geo-information  (Flanagin  &  Metzger,  2008;   Goodchild   &   Li,   2012).   In   the   context   of   the   general   trend   of   declining   resources   for   national   mapping   agencies   and   the   elimination   of   the   Statistics   Canada   long-form   census   (Walton-Roberts   et   al.,   2014),   VGI   is   becoming   especially   important   where   authoritative   geographic  information  is  lacking  (Haklay  et  al.,  2014).   Adding  to  the  value  of  a  novel  source  of  geographic  information,  there  is  mounting   evidence   that   institutions--including   government   and   non-government   organizations   (NGOs)--can   use   VGI   as   a   mechanism   to   build   local   capacity   to   support   collaboration,   supplement   traditional   data   sources,   and   inform   decision-making.   Johnson   &   Sieber   (2012a,  2012b),  for  example,  explored  both  the  motivation  driving  government  adoption  of   the   Geoweb,   and   strategies   for   increasing   access   to   and   use   of   the   data   subsequently   produced.   Haklay   et   al.   (2014)   studied   VGI   use   in   government,   providing   the   most   comprehensive  guide  for  VGI  implementation  to  date.  They  further  noted  that  the  process   by  which  the  data  are  collected--including  organizational  practices,  regulatory  issues  (i.e.,   license  conditions),  and  technical  specifications--is  more  likely  to  impede  the  acceptance   of  VGI  than  the  early  concerns  associated  with  quality,  accuracy,  and  completeness  of  VGI.   This   raises   the   question:   what   are   the   organizational   practices,   regulatory   issues,   and   technical   specifications   that   support   the   production   of   VGI?   Essentially,   what   systems   support  the  creation  of  VGI?   Recent   literature   has   alluded   to   the   fact   that   there   needs   to   be   a   formal,   standardized   framework   for   the   creation   of   VGI   for   various   reasons,   which   include   increasing   the   completeness,   accuracy,   and   reliability   of   the   VGI   produced.   For   example,   Goodchild   &   Li   (2012,   p.   118)   highlighted   that   "the   rules   in   use   have   been   assembled   pragmatically   and   without   a   conceptual   or   theoretical   framework",   suggesting   that   a   framework  can  help  formalize  the  VGI  process  and  make  it  "amenable  to  implementation".   Peng  &  Tsou  (2003)  also  encouraged  Internet  GIS  users  to  understand  the  mechanisms  of   system   implementation   before   applying   Web-based   GIS   to   the   range   of   geographic      11  

   problems.   Finally,   Goodchild   stated,   in   a   conversation   with   Turner,   "I   think   the   binary   between  local  and  professional  knowledges  is  becoming  problematic.  We  need  to  study  the   systems  that  have  been  used  in  some  VGI  projects  to  measure  trust,  rather  than  relying  on   simple  surrogates  like  professional  qualifications  or  membership  in  organizations"  (M.  W.   Wilson   &   Graham,   2013,   p.   17).   Indeed,   studying   the   systems   that   have   been   used   to   generate  VGI  can  tell  us  more  than  just  about  trust.  Understanding  the  systems  expands  our   knowledge  of  the  conditions  in  which  data  are  acquired;  the  people,  both  professionals  and   citizens,   who   are   involved;   and   the   technical   infrastructure   that   enables   the   input,   management,  analysis,  and  presentation  of  VGI.  As  such,  this  paper  proposes  a  conceptual   framework  for  the  systems  that  support  future  practical  implementations  of  VGI.   Following  this  introduction,  Section  2  of  this  paper  provides  a  brief  history  of  VGI,   using   OpenStreetMap,   Ushahidi,   and   RinkWatch   as   examples.   In   Section   3,   we   look   through   the  lens  of  systems  science  and  geographic  information  systems  to  inform  the  development   of   VGI   systems.   In   Section   4,   we   present   both   the   components   (project,   participants,   and   technical   infrastructure)   and   functions   (input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation)   that  are  relevant,  in  varying  degrees,  to  all  VGI  systems.  Section  5  presents  a  discussion  of   the   potential   and   limitations   of   VGI   systems   as   a   mechanism   for   collaboration   and   participation.   We   conclude   with   recommendations   for   future   VGI   systems   research,   development,   and   application,   calling   for   strategic   consideration   of   the   systems   that   support  the  production  of  VGI.  

2.2  A  Brief  History  of  VGI  
Recognizing  the  value  of  geographic  information  created  by  non-experts,  Goodchild   (2007,   p.   212)   coined   the   term   volunteered   geographic   information   in   2007   "as   a   special   case   of   the   more   general   Web   phenomenon   of   user-generated   content".   Goodchild   referred   explicitly  to  the  notion  of  `citizens  as  sensors',  which  was  introduced  previously  by  Burke  et   al.   (2006)   as   `participatory   sensing'.   VGI   has   also   been   described   as   `user-generated   geographic   content'   (Goodchild,   2008).   The   concept   of   geographic   information   that   is   crowdsourced  is  not  new.  Non-experts  have  been  capturing,  describing,  and  recording  the   spatial  nature  of  their  experiences  throughout  history;  a  sort  of  non-digital  VGI.  One  of  the      12  

   most  well-known  examples  is  the  Christmas  Bird  Count;  starting  in  1900,  tens  of  thousands   of   participants   voluntarily   reported   bird   sightings   at   Christmas   time,   which   led   to   an   "unparalleled  database  of  migratory  and  bird  population  data"  (Flanagin  &  Metzger,  2008,   p.   143).   However,   VGI   was   not   a   prominent   topic   in   geographic   research   previously   because  it  was  difficult  to  capture  these  spatial  experiences  with  enough  detail  to  make  a   significant   contribution   to   the   development   of   spatial   data   and   maps.   It   is   within   the   VGI   paradigm--enabled   by   the   Geoweb,   location-aware   devices,   and   citizens   acting   as   sensors--that  the  tools  and  resources  for  collecting  and  processing  geographic  information   from   volunteers   are   readily   available.   There   are   various   aims   for   implementing   a   VGI   system,   which   include   base   mapping   coverage,   emergency   reporting,   and   citizen   science.   We   highlight   each   of   these   drivers   using   OpenStreetMap,   Ushahidi,   and   RinkWatch   as   examples.   2.2.1  VGI  and  Base  Mapping  Coverage   Arguably,  one  of  the  most  successful  VGI  projects  is  OpenStreetMap  (OSM),  a  global   mapping  application  created  by  volunteers.  Based  on  Wikipedia's  peer  production  model,   OSM  provides  free,  editable,  and  downloadable  coverage  for  the  locations  and  geometries   of   topographic   features   (Haklay   &   Weber,   2008).   When   compared   to   traditional   mapping   projects,   the   data   generated   through   OSM   is,   in   some   areas,   more   detailed   and   accurate   than   the   authoritative   maps   produced   by   national   mapping   agencies,   such   as   the   United   Kingdom's  Ordnance  Survey  (Haklay,  2010).  Given  the  efforts  of  volunteers,  these  data  are   more  readily  updated,  especially  when  there  is  an  immediate  need  for  more  detailed  data.   Prior   to   the   2010   earthquake   in   Haiti,   OSM   data   in   the   area   surrounding   Port-au-Prince   were   quite   basic:   shorelines   and   rudimentary   road   coverage.   Immediately   following   the   earthquake,   the   urgent   need   for   detailed   topographic   data   triggered   a   massive   response   by   the   OSM   community.   Both   on   the   ground   (i.e.,   uploading   GPS   tracks)   and   remote   (i.e.,   tracing   satellite   images)   contributions   were   uploaded,  totaling   over  10,000  edits  in  just  a   few  short  weeks,  which  effectively  helped  thousands  of  relief  workers  navigate  the  disaster   area  (Zook,  Graham,  Shelton,  &  Gorman,  2010).  The  utility  and  open  access  of  OSM  is  also   extending   the   base   mapping   coverage   to   many   thematic   uses.   In   fact,   in   the   report   on

   2.2.3  VGI  and  Citizen  Science   VGI   is   increasingly   being   used   in   the   domain   of   science   and   research.   Broadly   categorized   as   citizen   science,   these   "projects   engage   members   of   the   public   in   working   with  professional  scientists  in  a  diverse  range  of  practices"  (Edwards,  2014,  p.  1).  Although   citizen  science  predates  VGI,  Goodchild  (2007)  first  introduced  the  term  VGI  by  relating  it   to  the  concept  of  citizen  science  because  scientific  observations  are  often  associated  with   well-defined  geographic  features.  Haklay  (2013)  describes  the  integration  between  citizen   science   and   VGI   as   `geographical   citizen   science'.   Within   the   citizen   science   scope,   VGI   is   being   used   most   frequently   in   environmental   monitoring   (Gouveia   &   Fonseca,   2008;   Rinner,   Kumari,   &   Mavedati,   2011;   Seeger,   2008).   A   notable   example   of   VGI   in   the   realm   of   citizen  science  is  RinkWatch:  a  project  that  gathers  VGI  from  people  who  have  backyard  ice   rinks   in   the   winter   months.   Aided   by   the   Geoweb,   rink   enthusiasts   make   routine   observations   regarding   the   `skatability'   of   their   rinks,   which   in   turn,   builds   a   detailed   database   about   environmental   conditions   and   their   change   over   time.   The   project   is   helping   researchers   study   the   micro-level   impacts   of   climate   change   (Damyanov,   Damon   Matthews,   &   Mysak,   2012).   The   growing   number   of   citizen   science   projects   is   filling   in   information   gaps   between   the   public,   scientists,   and   decision-makers,   by   drawing   on   a   range   of   trained   and   ad-hoc   observers   (Connors   et   al.,   2012).   Moving   forward,   we   draw   on   OSM,   Ushahidi,   and   RinkWatch   examples   throughout   the   paper   to   demonstrate   how   the   creation  of  VGI  can  be  conceptualized.  

2.3  Toward  Defining  VGI  Systems  
Various   authors   have   already   identified   a   range   of   components,   functions,   and   subsystems   that   govern   VGI   systems.   For   example,   Hardy,   Frew,   &   Goodchild   (2012)   referred  to  the  collection,  storage,  visualization,  analysis,  and  application  of  VGI.  Turner  (by   way   of   Wilson   and   Graham,   2013)   discussed   the   production,   consumption,   analysis,   visualization,   and   sharing   of   VGI.   Goodchild   (2008)   addressed   the   collection,   compilation,   indexing,  and  distribution  of  VGI.  Brown  (2012,  p.  7)  stated  "VGI  is  the  harnessing  of  tools   to  create,  assemble,  and  disseminate  geographic  data  provided  voluntarily  by  individuals".   Characteristic  of  more  traditional  geographic  information  systems  in  the  realm  of  Web  2.0      15  

   (the  interactive  Web),  Elwood  (2009,  p.  257)  identified  new  geovisualization  technologies   "as   `not-quite-GIS'   assemblages   of   hardware,   software,   and   functionalities".   Common   to   these  different  views  of  VGI  is  the  consideration  of  multiple  system  components  and  their   interactions,  although  this  is  not  explicated  by  any  of  the  authors.  In  the  following  sections,   we  therefore  briefly  outline  the  definition  of  a  system  in  systems  science  and  explore  the   parallels  between  geographic  information  systems  and  VGI  systems.   2.3.1  System  Definition  in  Systems  Science   According  to  Kulla  (1979),  systems  science  emerged  from  a  combination  of  concepts   developed   in   general   systems   theory   (Bertalanffy,   1968)   and   cybernetics   (Wiener,   1961).   In  an  approach  to  better  understand  natural  phenomena  and  tackle  increasingly  complex   socio-economic   processes,   researchers   proposed   to   view   the   world   through   a   systems   perspective.   A   system   is   defined   as   "a   set   of   objects   together   with   relationships   between   the   objects   and   between   their   attributes"   (Hall   &   Fagen,   1956).   The   systems   perspective   provides   a   holistic   view   on   real-world   objects   and   their   relationships,   and   acknowledges   important   properties   of   systems   that   may   otherwise   go   unnoticed,   including:   complexity,   openness,   dynamics,   and   directedness   (finality)   (Kulla,   1979).   To   encompass   the   many   different   facets   of   the   systems   perspective   that   have   since   developed   in   science,   researchers  like  Klir  (2001)  now  define  it  broadly  as  "the  field  of  scientific  inquiry  whose   object  of  study  are  systems".  Therefore,  computer  systems,  such  as  GIS,  can  serve  as  both   the   object   of   study   for   systems   scientists   as   well   as   the   tool   by   which   to   represent,   analyze,   and  visualize  complex  real-world  systems.   2.3.2  Geographic  Information  Systems  (GIS)   In   addition   to   the   foundations   of   systems   science,   the   common   link   of   `geographic   information'   between   VGI   and   GIS   warrants   the   consideration   of   traditional   GIS   components   before   delineating   the   parts   of   VGI   systems.   Relating   specifically   to   spatial   analysis  tools  implemented  in  GIS,  but  mimicking  a  current  need  in  VGI  research,  Goodchild   (2008,   p.   14)   stated   the   necessity   to   "systematize   what   is   otherwise   a   confusing   mass   of   methods".  Tomlinson's  (2007)  GIS  implementation  framework  considered  the  information   products   resulting   from   the   components   and   functions   within   the   system.   GIS   could   be      16  

   defined  based  on  its  primary  subsystems,  in  which  geographic  information  emerges  as  an   information   product   resulting   from   the   interplay   of   the   hardware,   software,   data,   and   people   components,   and   is   shaped   by   a   series   of   functions   for   geographic   data   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation   within   GIS   (Bill   &   Fritsch,   1999;   Heywood,   Cornelius,  &  Carver,  2006;  Longley,  Goodchild,  Maguire,  &  Rhind,  2011;  Tomlinson,  2007).   This   definition   identifies   stages   in   the   GIS   process;   however,   it   does   not   consider   the   interaction  between  those  stages  or  reflect  the  experience  of  implementation.  Heywood  et   al.  (2006)  extended  the  traditional  systems  perspective  when  defining  the  components  of   GIS  by  taking  the  position  that  "GIS  cannot  operate  in  isolation  from  an  application  area".   To   overcome   the   limitations   of   a   linear   systems   approach,   Chrisman   (1999)   proposed  a  view  of  GIS  as  a  set  of  nested  components  with  interactions  that  encompass  the   technical   components   as   well   as   the   larger   context   and   institutional   arrangements.   The   nested   rings   in   Chrisman's   conceptual   framework   are,   from   the   simplest   to   the   most   complex   level:   measurements,   representations,   operations,   transformations,   institutional   context,  and  social  and  cultural  context.  Each  ring  depends  on  components  addressed  on  a   simpler  level,  while  embedding  the  considerations  that  are  involved  in  operating  the  entire   GIS.   It   is   Chrisman's   (1999)   definition   of   the   subsystems   that   shape   GIS,   which   most   influences  how  we  understand  VGI  systems.  

2.4  VGI  System  Components  
VGI   systems   can   be   regarded   as   an   environment   for   the   production   of   VGI   as   an   information   product.   The   components,   which   serve   as   the   building   blocks   for   the   system,   are   a   complex   arrangement   between   the   project   and   its   initiators,   the   participants   who   volunteer   their   geographic   information,   and   the   technical   infrastructure   (hardware,   software,   and   the   Geoweb);   together,   these   components   lead   to   the   creation   of   a   crowdsourced   information   product,   or   VGI   (Figure   2.1).   Within   the   technical   infrastructure,  the  functions  allow  for  the  input,  management,  analysis,  and  presentation  of   VGI.  Mimicking  Chrisman's  (1999)  nested  rings  used  to  understand  how  GIS  operates,  VGI   systems   consist   of   interdependent   components   with   interactions   that   address   technical,   contextual,   and   organizational   considerations.   Further,   the   considerations   within   each      17  

   component   have   a   substantial   impact   on   the   entire   VGI   system,   and   subsequently,   on   the   VGI   produced.   Although   the   framework   needs   to   be   tailored   to   fit   specific   projects,   we   illustrate  each  component  using  OpenStreetMap,  Ushahidi,  and  RinkWatch  as  examples.  

     Figure  2.1:  The  components  of  volunteered  geographic  information  (VGI)  systems   2.4.1  Project   VGI   systems   are   often   initiated   around   a   problem   or   a   purpose,   and   are   executed   through   a   project.   Projects   can   be   triggered   by   an   event,   such   as   a   political   crisis   or   natural   disaster.   Ushahidi,   for   example,   was   first   initiated   in   response   to   the   political   upheaval   following  Kenya's  2007  presidential  election  (Okolloh,  2009).  Alternatively,  there  is  the  less   urgent   (but   arguably   equally   important)   need   to   gather   and   share   topographic   or   thematic   geo-information,  such  as  in  the  cases  of  OpenStreetMap  and  RinkWatch.  Regardless  of  the   initiating  motivations,  the  goal  and  strategy  of  all  VGI  systems  needs  to  be  clearly  defined  at   the  onset  of  a  project.  Otherwise,  a  project  might  suffer  a  similar  fate  as  the  thousands  of   Ushahidi  maps  that  have  ended  up  in  the  `Ushahidi  graveyard';  a  collection  of  purposeless   crowd   maps   (Vota,   2012).   Although   some   now   defunct   maps   did   serve   as   learning   and   training  tools  for  those  experimenting  with  crowdmapping,  the  graveyard  is  an  important   reminder  to  consider  the  purpose  and  plan  for  sustainability  within  a  project.   The   project   is   often   closely   related   to   the   domain   of   the   initiator,   and   in   the   early   stages  of  VGI  system  development,  the  initiators  have  the  greatest  control  over  the  design.   As   individuals   or   groups,   they   make   important   methodological   decisions   that   influence   the   VGI  system  produced.  Key  considerations  include  the  study  location  (e.g.,  global,  Kenya,  or   Canada),   and   the   timeframe   of   the   project   (e.g.,   ongoing,   immediate   emergency   response,      18  

   or  duration  of  a  funded  research  project).  In  traditional  GIS,  the  people  component  typically   refers   to   professionals   (i.e.,   researchers,   consultants,   or   technicians)   and   applications   are   tied  to  institutions  (i.e.,  academic,  business,  or  government)  (Longley  et  al.,  2011).   In   VGI   systems,  on  the  other  hand,  the  people  initiating  the  application  still  plan,  implement,  and   operate  the  system  but  may  not  have  formal  training  in  GIS  or  institutional  ties,  and  often   present   a   unique   arrangement   between   subject,   producer,   communicator,   and   consumer   (Goodchild,  2009).   Despite  the  changing  roles  between  producers  and  users,  or  `produsers'  (Coleman  et   al.,   2009),   the   initiators   leading   the   development   of   VGI   systems   have   typically   been   associated  with  grassroots  movements,  and  encompass  individuals,  community  groups,  and   organizations.   Such   is   the   case   with   Ushahidi,   which   was   initiated   by   a   group   of   Kenyan   activists   led   by   Okolloh,   a   prominent   Kenyan   blogger   (Okolloh,   2009).   However,   the   increasing   institutional   interest   in   VGI   and   crowdmapping,   especially   by   government,   represents   a   more   traditional   top   down   approach   and   introduces   a   new   set   of   incentives   for   initiating  VGI  systems.  In  the  report  on  crowdsourcing  geographic  information  by  Haklay   et   al.   (2014),   each   of   the   29   case   studies   presented   include   various   levels   of   government   involvement.   The   interactions,   or   information   flows,   were   broadly   categorized   as:   public- government,   government-public-government,   or,   public-government-public.   Regardless   of   the   domain   of   the   initiators,   they   ultimately   make   critical   decisions   about   the   participation   strategy  and  technical  infrastructure  used,  as  discussed  next.   2.4.2  Participants   Within  the  application  area,  project  initiators  need  to  identify  from  whom  they  wish   to  collect  the  VGI.  This  participation  strategy  varies  substantially  between  projects.  Related   to   geographical   citizen   science   specifically,   Haklay   (2013)   identifies   that   the   role   of   the   volunteer   can   be   `active'   or   `passive'.   We   believe   this   concept   extends   to   VGI,   where   participants   can   contribute   to   VGI   both   actively   and   passively.   With   projects   aimed   at   collecting  active  contributions,  the  participants  are  often  drawn  from  an  engaged  group  of   stakeholders   such   as   a   purposely   selected   community   group,   a   pre-selected   segment   of   the   population,   a   set   of   authorized   and   trusted   contributors,   or   unknown   contributors      19  

   motivated  via  a  media  or  outreach  campaign.  In  the  case  of  RinkWatch,  initiators  identify   those  who  maintain  backyard  ice  rinks  as  their  primary  participants,  while  OpenStreetMap   relies  on  a  broad  range  of  participants  to  contribute  information  on  their  local  community   (Damyanov   et   al.,   2012;   Haklay   &   Weber,   2008).   In   all   cases   of   VGI   systems   aimed   at   collecting   active   content,   the   participant   "is   expected   to   consciously   contribute   to   the   observation  or  the  analysis"  (Haklay,  2013a,  p.  112).   Conversely,  in  projects  that  aim  to  gather  passive  contributions,  "the  contributor  is   acting   more   as   an   observation   platform   and   the   data   are   gathered   without   active   engagement"   (Haklay,   2013a,   p.   112).   In   these   types   of   projects,   the   participants   use   technology,   such   as   GPS   transmitting   a   signal   from   a   smart   phone   or   other   hand-held   device.  Although  the  participant  may  not  be  actively  volunteering  content,  such  as  logging   into  a  Geoweb  environment  and  adding  a  contribution  to  a  map,  they  are  volunteering  to   contribute  their  geo-information.  A  well-known  case  of  passive  contribution  is  the  Google   Maps   application   that   employs   user-authorized   GPS   information   to   crowdsource   traffic   information   (Barth,   2009).   It   is   important   to   note   that   active   and   passive   content   is   not   mutually   exclusive.   OpenStreetMap,   for   example,   relies   on   passive   contributions   when   a   participant   uses   GPS   tracking   to   map   a   road,   and   relies   on   active   contributions   to   clean   the   GPS  recordings  and  add  relevant  attribute  data  (Haklay  &  Weber,  2008).   In  many  projects,  a  well-defined  methodology  for  generating  participation  increases   the   likelihood   of   volunteer   contributions.   Thus,   a   major   consideration   related   to   participants  is  the  media  or  promotional  strategy  employed.  In  addition  to  social  media  as   an   obvious   avenue   for   promotion,   combining   Web   outreach   with   more   traditional   media,   including  radio  and  newspapers,  has  proven  to  increase  the  reach  of  a  project.  For  example,   RinkWatch   organizers   observed   spikes   in   participation   on   their   website   during   promotional   campaigns   and   most   notably,   when   the   project   was   picked   up   by   the   local   newspaper  and  national  radio  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013).  Because  of  the  variability  within  VGI   systems,   suitable   media   strategies   are   contingent   upon   the   project   at   hand.   Although   there   is   not   yet   an   established   methodology   for   generating   participation   in   VGI   systems,   purposefully  devising  a  participation  strategy  could  lead  to  a  greater  understanding  of  the   type  of  VGI  created.      20  

   2.4.3  Technical  Infrastructure:  Hardware,  Software,  and  the  Geoweb   A  technical  infrastructure  supports  the  creation  of  VGI,  and  each  system  depends  on   a   unique   array   of   hardware   and   software   components.   The   combination   of   technical   infrastructure  deployed  ultimately  depends  on  the  type  of  VGI  desired,  and  varies  greatly   across   projects.   VGI   systems   hardware   can   include   server   and   client   computers,   and   location-enabled   devices,   such   as   GPS   units   and   smart   phones.   The   software   component   can   include   proprietary   and   open-source   platforms,   such   as   ArcGIS   Online   (e.g.,   RinkWatch)   or   Ushahidi,   respectively.   There   are   also   two   sides   to   the   technical   infrastructure:  the  user  interfaces  or  client-side  architecture,  and  the  developer  or  server- side   architecture.   OpenStreetMap,   for   example,   relies   on   navigation   (e.g.,   GPS),   a   desktop   computer,   server   hardware,   and   dozens   (if   not   hundreds)   of   software   options   (for   more,   see  the  OSM  Software/Desktop  Wiki,  2014).   The   compilation   of   hardware   and   software   that   enables   Web   mapping   is   more   commonly  understood  as  the  Geoweb,  a  collection  of  online  location-enabled  services  and   infrastructure.  Initially  limited  to  a  one-way  flow  of  information  from  producers  to  users,   the  Geoweb  evolved  to  be  participatory,  enabling  a  two-way  flow  of  information  and  thus   facilitating  the  production  of  VGI  (Johnson  &  Sieber,  2012b).  The  Geoweb  can  provide  the   user  interface  for  the  collection  of  VGI.  However,  not  all  Geoweb  infrastructures  are  capable   of   collecting   VGI;   similarly,   not   all   VGI   is   collected   by   way   of   the   Geoweb.   One   notable   advantage   of   the   Geoweb   is   the   layers   of   geo-information   that   support   the   mapping   interface,   which   provide   geographic   context   and   allow   contributors   to   identify   the   relevant   geographic  area  (i.e.,  seed  content).   The  technical  infrastructure  employed  also  dictates  the  functions  available  to  create   and   manage   VGI.   Although   there   are   a   host   of   functionalities   within   the   spectrum   of   VGI   systems,   we   define   the   main   functional   groups   (in   analogy   to   GIS)   as   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation.   An   example   of   the   technical   infrastructure   supporting   the   collection   of   VGI   is   the   Ushahidi   platform;   an   open-source   self-contained   Geoweb   tool   with   customizable   crowdmapping   options.   Initially   designed   to   facilitate   the   sharing   of   information  during  the  Kenyan  election  crisis,  it  has  been  repurposed  thousands  of  times  to   gather  a  diversity  of  spatial  information  from  the  crowd  (Okolloh,  2009).      21  

   Zook   et   al.   (2010)   profiled   Ushahidi   and   three   other   Web-based   mapping   services   (CrisisCamp  Haiti,  OpenStreetMap,  and  GeoCommons)  that  were  deployed  to  crowdsource   disaster   relief   during   the   2010   Haitian   earthquake.   The   Ushahidi   platform   demonstrates   the   unique   data   input   options,   including   short   message   service   (SMS)   and   Twitter,   which   allow   project   initiators   to   gather   local,   on-the-ground   knowledge   (Zook   et   al.,   2010).   Beyond  the  input  functions,  the  Ushahidi  platform  also  offers  functionality  for  management   (e.g.,   administrator   approval   of   participant   contributions),   analysis   (e.g.,   contributor   statistics),   and   presentation   (e.g.,   interactive   Web   map)   of   the   VGI   within   the   technical   environment.   With   an   abundance   of   hardware,   software,   and   Geoweb   considerations   and   combinations   available   for   VGI   systems,   coupled   with   an   array   of   functional   options,   the   technical  infrastructure  needs  to  be  evaluated  on  a  system-by-system  basis.  

2.5  Discussion  
Through   this   research,   we   have   come   to   understand   VGI   systems   as   a   set   of   components   that   help   tackle   the   increasingly   complex   task   of   creating   VGI.   In   addition   to   providing  a  novel  source  of  geographic  information,  the  system  that  drives  the  creation  of   VGI   is,   in   itself,   collaborative.   Crowdsourcing   "is   about   creating   fluidity   in   data   sharing   and   collaboration   by   breaking   down   barriers   in   access   to   technology   and   participation   through   the   Web,   open   standards,   and   simplified   interfaces"   (Zook   et   al.,   2010,   p.   23).   Thus,   beyond   another  mechanism  for  generating  (geo-)  information,  akin  to  a  survey,  there  is  the  added   benefit   of   fostering   collaboration   and   participation.   The   following   sections   explore   the   collaboration   and   participation   enabled   by   VGI   systems,   as   well   as   provide   a   critical   assessment  of  issues  associated  with  the  implementation  of  VGI  systems.   2.5.1  VGI  Systems  as  a  Mechanism  for  Collaboration  and  Participation   There   is   a   long   history   of   government   and   decision-makers   relying   on   a   broader   public   to   participate   in,   and   provide   valuable   information   to   aid,   decision-making.   Arnstein   (1969)   identified   a   ladder   of   citizen   participation   to   typify   the   extent   of   citizen   power   within   the   participation   process   associated   with   federal   social   programs   back   in   1969.   Later,  in  geographic  information  studies,  Participatory  GIS  (PGIS)  responded  to  the  need  to   develop  a  collaborative  and  partnered  approach  to  GIS  (Sieber,  2006).  Furthering  the  goals      22  

   of   PGIS,   participation   on   the   Geoweb   is   bringing   together   diverse   stakeholders,   both   professionals  and  the  public  alike,  representing  the  convergence  of  spatial  information  and   technologies   with   digital   media   (Leszczynski   &   Wilson,   2013).   The   participatory   Geoweb,   in   some   instances,   seems   to   be   achieving   a   higher   rung   on   Arnstein's   (1969)   ladder   of   citizen   participation   than   PGIS   because   the   public   can   achieve   greater   control   over   the   system.   Expanding   on   the   participation   enabled   by   the   Geoweb,   VGI   represents   a   social   transformation  in  the  way  data  can  be  collected  and  shared.  Web-based  participation  and   the   production   of   VGI   are   supporting   novel   types   of   collaboration   (Butt   &   Li,   2012).   The   participatory   nature   of   VGI   is   demonstrated   through   the   plethora   of   VGI   projects   that   employ  Geoweb  tools  to  collect  data  from  actively  engaged  citizens  and  groups  (Tudge  et   al.,   2012).   For   example,   the   MapChat   tool   (Hall,   Chipeniuk,   Feick,   Leahy,   &   Deparday,   2010,   p.  766)  was  "developed  to  facilitate  Web-based  interaction  between  individual  citizens  and   groups   interested   in   discussing   issues   of   local   spatial   relevance".   Similarly,   Rinner   &   Bird   (2009)   and   Cinnamon   &   Schuurman   (2012)   used   a   participatory   approach   to   collect   and   map  observations  and  opinions  related  to  sustainable  neighbourhood  planning  and  public   health,  respectively.   However,   it   is   important   to   note   that   not   all   VGI   systems   are   participatory.   While   active  contributions  can  be  considered  participatory,  passive  contributions  do  not  require   the  same  level  of  engagement  from  volunteers.  Rather,  content  is  volunteered  by  consent,   rather   than   active   participation.   Given   this   distinction   between   active   and   passive   contributions,   we   are   more   confident   stating   that   VGI   systems   are   collaborative   but   not   necessarily   participatory.   VGI   systems   support   a   distributed   process,   where   tasks   are   outsourced  to  a  diverse  network  of  individuals  and  institutions,  enabling  a  wider  group  to   collaborate  in  information  creation  and  knowledge  sharing  (Roberts,  Grosser,  &  Swartley,   2012).   Owing  to  the  distinction  between  active  and  passive  contributions,  how  VGI  systems   fit  into  the  PGIS  paradigm  is  still  to  be  fully  understood.  PGIS  emerged  from  critiques  of  GIS   in  the  1990s,  calling  for  more  inclusive  use  of  GIS  that  engages  and  empowers  the  public   while  developing  more  sustainable  community-driven  GIS  practices  (Brown,  2012;  Sieber,      23  

   2006).  Tulloch  (2008)  explored  the  extent  to  which  VGI  and  PGIS  demonstrate  overlapping   boundaries,  and  Hall  et  al.  (2010)  later  concluded  that  it  is  more  constructive  to  view  those   boundaries  as  an  intersection,  rather  than  a  division.  Although  it  seems  to  follow  that  VGI   and  PGIS  are  not  synonymous,  Elwood  (2008)  emphasized  that  PGIS  can  offer  a  productive   framework  to  motivate  VGI  research.   2.5.2  Critical  Assessment  of  Collaboration  and  Participation  within  VGI  Systems   Since   VGI   systems   can   engage   the   public   in   collaborative   and   sometimes   participatory   ways,   it   is   important   to   step   back   to   look   at   the   fundamental   issues   raised   by   their   implementation.   The   creation   of   VGI   lies   at   the   intersection   of   technology   and   society   (Elwood  et  al.,  2012;  Sui  &  Goodchild,  2011).  Thus,  VGI  systems  have  not  only  technical,  but   also  social  and  political,  ramifications.  Discussions  surrounding  the  implications  of  VGI  are   already   in   progress,   with   a   growing   body   of   literature   related   to   credibility   (Flanagin   &   Metzger,  2008),  uncertainty  (Grira,  Bédard,  &  Roche,  2009),  privacy  (Scassa,  2013,  2014),   the   data-divide   (Cinnamon   &   Schuurman,   2012),   and   contributor   motivations   (Dodge   &   Kitchin,  2013).  In  response  to  the  critical  appraisal  of  the  inherent  issues  that  come  with  an   evolving  system,  Mooney  &  Cocoran  (2011)  counter  that  the  risk  of  obtaining  a  fragmented   dataset  is  trumped  by  the  collaboration  it  can  generate.   The  capacity  of  VGI  to  democratize  the  creation,  use,  or  dissemination  of  geographic   information   is   also   an   important   consideration.   Haklay   (2013b,   p.   67)   affirmed   that   "a   concerted   effort   is   required   to   integrate   new   groups   in   society   in   the   design   and   development   of   technological   objects   and   systems   and   an   ongoing   effort   to   reach   out   to   those   who   are   under-represented".   Although   there   are   inherent   issues   in   the   democratization   of   VGI,   or   what   Haklay   (2013)   referred   to   as   the   delusion   of   democracy,   Hardy  et  al.  (2012)  stressed  the  importance  of  working  collaboratively,  which  can  act  as  a   process   of   empowerment.   Poore   &   Chrisman   (2006)   explored   a   social   theory   for   the   production   and   use   of   GIS;   similarly,   we   need   to   continue   to   critically   consider   the   production  of  VGI  systems,  while  addressing  the  fundamental  issues  instigated  by  their  use.

2.6  Conclusions  and  Future  Research  Directions  
This   paper   presents   an   investigation   into   the   creation   of   VGI   from   a   systems   perspective.   VGI   itself   is   understood   as   a   crowdsourced   geographic   information   product,   while   VGI   systems   enable   the   creation   of   VGI.   The   VGI   system   framework   breaks   down   the   process   of   creating   VGI   into   three   connected   components:   the   underlying   project,   the   participants,   and   the   technical   infrastructure.   By   identifying   these   primary   components,   and   the   considerations   within   each   one,   those   initiating   VGI   systems   are   better   able   to   make   informed   decisions   on   the   system   design,   which   will   ultimately   influence   the   outcomes,   whether   the   desired   outcome   is   to   generate   new   geographic   information   or   promote   greater   collaboration.   Overall,   VGI   has   the   potential   to   add   to   our   collection   of   maps   and   spatial   data   and   serve   as   an   information   source   that   can   enrich   our   research   programs.   VGI   systems,   then,   should   be   viewed   as   a   method   to   harness   the   crowd   and   connect  us  to  the  phenomena  we  are  most  interested  in  studying.   There  is  more  to  add  to  this  conversation.  As  concluded  by  Hardy  et  al.  (2012,  p.  16),   "research  on  VGI  production  is  a  nascent  area  with  many  unexplored  avenues".  To  date,  VGI   remains   largely   untapped   as   a   resource   for   exploratory   and   analytical   research   (Haklay,   2010).  Now  that  we  have  established  a  conceptual  framework  for  the  many  moving  parts   that  make  up  VGI  systems,  we  need  to  evaluate  how  existing  projects  apply  the  components   and   functions   within   the   framework.   Adding   to   Beaudreau,   Johnson,   and   Sieber's   (2012)   research   on   strategic   choices   made   when   developing   Geoweb   applications,   we   need   to   evaluate  the  strategic  choices  made  during  VGI  system  development,  and  the  impact  those   choices  have  on  the  resulting  VGI.   Next,   within   the   VGI   systems   framework,   we   did   not   address   temporal   considerations.   Recent   research   by   Resch   (2013)   emphasized   the   importance   of   incorporating   (near)   real-time   collection   of   observations   and   measurements   from   both   people   as   sensors   (or   what   we   describe   as   active)   and   collective   sensing   (passive)   networks.   Future   work   could   explore   incorporating   sensor   networks   into   VGI   systems   to   enable  real-time  monitoring.  Finally,  it  is  necessary  to  explore  Geoweb  environments  that   are   capable   of   supporting   the   collection   of   VGI.   While   Ushahidi   and   OpenStreetMap   are   good   examples   of   Geoweb   platforms   that   support   VGI   systems,   the   increasing   interest   in      25  

   crowdmapping  from  public,  private,  and  not-for-profit  sectors  necessitate  a  more  strategic   review  of  the  tools  readily  available  to  support  VGI  systems.  It  is  only  once  the  system   is   understood  that  we  can  better  implement  VGI  as  a  viable  approach  to  address  the  host  of   geographic  problems  that  may  arise  in  the  future.

3.  FOOD  MAPPING  2.0:  CLIMBING  THE  LADDER  OF  STAKEHOLDER  ENGAGEMENT  

   Abstract   Due   to   the   spatial   nature   of   food   systems,   many   food   initiatives   employ   some   form   of   mapping   to   communicate   the   intricacies   of   a   food   system.   Rapidly   evolving   mapping   technologies--including   GIS,   Web   2.0,   the   Geoweb,   and   volunteered   geographic   information--have   expanded   into   food   mapping.   As   such,   this   paper   explores   recent   advancements   in   mapping,   and   uses   a   ladder   of   engagement   to   introduce   and   provide   examples   of   visualization,   collaboration,   interaction,   and   participation   in   food   mapping.   While   many   projects   achieve   visualization   and   collaboration   using   GIS   and   data   sharing,   interaction   and   participation   using   the   Geoweb   and   VGI   are   rarer,   but   a   necessary   step   toward  building  sustainable  and  regenerative  food  systems.   Keywords:   collaborative   asset   mapping;   food   mapping;   geographic   information   systems;   Geoweb;  Web  2.0;  volunteered  geographic  information  systems  

  

3.1  Introduction  
Challenges   faced   by   the   global   food   system   are   interrelated   with   problems   associated   with   climate   change,   poverty,   nutrition,   social   justice,   economic   security,   and   environmental   sustainability   (Francis,   2003).   Given   these   interconnections,   the   United   Nations'  Trade  and  Environmental  Review  emphasize  that  a  fundamental  transformation  of   agriculture   that   shifts   from   a   conventional   monoculture-based   agri-industry   to   a   mosaic   approach   for   sustainable,   regenerative   local   food   systems   is   necessary   (Hoffmann,   2013).   Feagan  (2007)  explored  the  many  permutations  of  beneficial  actions  within  the  local  food   systems   approach,   which   include   alternative   food   initiatives,   shortened   food   chains,   and   the  community  food  security  movement.

   This   paper   focuses   on   local   food   systems   broadly,   which   emphasize   locally   grown   and  processed  food;  driven  by  a  concern  for  a  healthy,  just,  and  resilient  food  system;  and  a   shifting   dependence   away   from   global   agri-industrial   food   production.   It   should   be   noted   that  not  all  agree  with  the  local  food  system  approach;  globally,  there  is  an  alternative  view   that  includes  greater  use  of  biotechnology  to  grow  and  modernize  the  global  agri-industry   food  system.   Continuing  with  local  food  systems,  food  leaders  all  over  the  world  emphasize  that  a   shared  vision  and  collaborative  approach  is  needed  to  build  and  maintain  an  adaptive  and   resilient   food   system   (Deloitte,   2013;   Knapp   &   Trainor,   2013).   This   is   no   small   task.   A   mosaicked  approach  to  local  food  systems  is  multi-faceted,  creating  space  for  a  full  range  of   actors   to   discuss   problems,   leverage   resources,   and   contribute   to   solutions   (Baker   et   al.,   2010).     These  actors  range  from  government  and  non-government  agencies,  academic  and   public   service   institutions,   to   community   groups,   and   individuals,   and   can   be   socially,   culturally,  ecologically,  or  politically  oriented  (Feagan,  2007).  In  fact,  some  stakeholders  do   not   even   consider   themselves   food   system   stakeholders;   they   are   the   farmers,   vegetable   gardeners,   or   business   people   who   are   going   about   their   work   or   hobbies   while   unknowingly   contributing   to   their   local   food   system.   According   to   Pothukuchi,   Joseph,   Burton,   &   Fisher   (2002,   p.   5),   "while   most   of   these   efforts   are   small-scale,   they   represent   the  seeds  of  creative  and  lasting  solutions  to  food  system  problems."   These   actions   and   initiatives   led   by   food   stakeholders   can   be   described   as   the   diverse   hyper-local   places   of   food   systems.   They   are   diverse   because   a   range   of   actors   is   involved,  working  on  initiatives  that  are  unique  in  scale,  location,  and  goals.  Levkoe  (2011)   describes   the   Canadian   Food   Movement   as   "a   decentralized   network   of   diverse,   self- organizing,  interconnected  initiatives  with  no  identifiable  beginning  or  end."     They   are   hyper-local   because   the   focus   is   on   individuals   or   small   groups   of   actors   within   a   community   that   emphasize   food   production   at   community   or   neighbourhood   scales;   in   contrast   to   "local"   food,   which   can   cover   entire   regions,   such   as   Ontario's   Local   Food   Act.   In   fact,   hyper-local   initiatives   are   not   even   captured   by   sustainability   plans   or      28  

   official  policy,  such  as  local  food  advocates  at  city  hall  deciding  to  plant  food  in  garden  beds   typically  reserved  for  flowers  (Fraser,  2014).     Finally,  they  are  places  of  local  food  systems  because  these  initiatives  are  happening   within  geographic  spaces  (a  geographically  defined  location)  that  are  context-sensitive  and   convey  some  aspect  of  meaning  (Feagan,  2007;  Feick  &  Robertson,  2014).  The  place  versus   space   debate   has   been   an   ongoing   topic   in   geographic   literature;   space   is   considered   a   geographically   defined   location,   while   place   links   people,   culture,   and   resources   within   a   space   (Feagan,   2007;   Pothukuchi   et   al.,   2002).   Unfortunately,   while   place   is   inextricably   intertwined   with   food,   our   food   has   been   divorced   from   the   places   it   comes   from   in   the   context  of  global  agri-industry.   Collectively,  these  diverse  and  hyper-local  places  within  the  larger  food  system  are   contributing  to  lasting  and  real  change  in  what  some  consider  a  broken  food  system  (Baker   et  al.,  2010;  Scharf  et  al.,  2010).  However,  with  so  many  stakeholders  and  diverse  initiatives   operating   at   different   scales,   a   mosaicked   approach   to   supporting   sustainable   and   regenerative  food  systems  is  a  major  challenge.  As  such,  mapping  various  aspects  of  food   systems  could  be  one  part  of  the  solution  to  aid  in  coordinating  cross-sector  engagement  of   all  food  system  stakeholders.   Much  of  the  information  relevant  to  food  systems--the  locations  of  farms  and  farm   gate   operations,   farmers'   markets,   and   community   gardens;   demographics,   land   use,   and   zoning;   transportation   and   distribution   infrastructure--has   a   spatial   component,   which   lends   itself   to   mapping   as   a   way   to   inform   local   food   decision-making.   Maps   can   be   used   to   restore   the   inherent   spatial   attributes   of   food   systems.   Further,   while   mapping   is   playing   an   increasingly   supportive   role   in   putting   place   back   into   food,   evolving   mapping   technologies--including   geographic   information   systems   (GIS),   Web   2.0,   the   geospatial   Web,   and   volunteered   geographic   information   (VGI)   systems--are   demonstrating   the   potential   to   encourage   greater   engagement   among   and   between   relevant   local   food   stakeholders  and  the  broader  public.   This   research   emerges   from   the   increasingly   urgent   need   to   assess   how   mapping   has  been  used  to  coordinate  existing  capacities  within  local  food  systems.  By  examining  the      29  

   rapidly   evolving   mapping   technologies   used   in   food   systems,   this   paper   explores   to   what   degree   these   tools   support   stakeholder   engagement   in   the   mapping   process.   While   the   focus   of   this   paper   is   Ontario,   Canada,   the   examples   illustrate   both   domestic   and   international  mapping  initiatives  that  are  ultimately  supporting  a  mosaicked,  coordinated,   and  local  food  system  approach.   Following   this   introduction,   Section   2   of   this   paper   presents   a   brief   history   of   stakeholder   engagement   in   mapping   and   the   associated   advancements   in   mapping   technologies.   Section   3   organizes   food-specific   mapping   initiatives   by   a   ladder   of   engagement   ranging   from   visualization,   to   collaboration,   interaction,   and   participation.   Finally,  Section  5  concludes  the  paper  with  recommendations  for  future  research,  calling  on   all   food   system   stakeholders   to   strive   for   greater   engagement.   This   paper   is   intended   to   serve  as  a  resource  for  those  wanting  to  learn  more  about  recent  mapping  developments,   current   status   of   food   mapping,   and   types   of   stakeholder   engagement   mapping   can   facilitate,  both  within  and  beyond  food  environments.  

3.2  Stakeholder  Engagement  in  Mapping  
Mapping  has  been  used  all  throughout  history  to  communicate  spatial  information,   revealing   patterns   not   obvious   by   looking   at   the   data   alone.   One   of   the   most   famous   examples   is   John   Snow's   1854   cholera   map   (Johnson,   2006).   While   the   popular   notion   of   the  cholera  epidemic  that  killed  many  London  residents  was  attributed  to  `bad  air',  Snow   was   suspicious   of   a   tainted   water   supply.   Without   a   sound   understanding   of   disease   transmission   at   the   time,   Snow   was   the   first   to   study   the   pattern   of   disease   by   talking  to   residents   and   mapping   the   residences   of   the   deceased.   The   map   clearly   illustrated   the   outbreak  occurred  around  a  public  water  pump  and  by  removing  the  handle,  the  outbreak   diminished  rapidly.  Thanks  to  the  insight  gained  from  his  mapping  approach,  Dr.  Snow  was   widely  credited  with  stopping  the  cholera  epidemic  (Johnson,  2006).   More  recently,  maps  have  been  helpful  in  tracking  the  spread  of  the  Ebola  virus.  One   of   the   many   examples   of   Ebola   mapping   efforts,   the   Red   Cross   is   enlisting   the   help   of   volunteers   to   create   detailed   maps   of   rural   areas   in   Africa   so   epidemiologists   have   more   detailed   geographic   information   to   track   the   virus   as   it   spreads   (Mohney,   2014).   Both   of      30  

   these  mapping  efforts,  Cholera  in  1854  and  Ebola  in  2014,  use  citizens  to  gather  their  data   and  strengthen  the  impact  the  map  can  have  on  decision-making.  The  involvement  of  the   communities   is   critically   important   to   mapping.   As   technologies   progressed,   so   has   the   ability  of  those  initiating  mapping  projects  to  engage  the  communities  they  seek  to  map.   Before  we  delve  into  the  progress   of  food  mapping  in  particular,  we  first  need  to  lay   the   groundwork   for   important   cartographic   and   technological   considerations   that   have   enabled  greater  citizen  engagement  in  mapping.  Early  map-making,  known  as  cartography,   was   quite   simple:   use   data   to   (hand)   draw   a   map.   While   early   maps   were   often   quite   artistic,   cartographers   were   limited   in   the   number   of   people   they   could   engage   in   the   mapping   process.   However,   technological   advancements   have   increased   the   capacity   of   maps   and   their   makers   to   engage   a   wider   public.   These   technologies   include   geographic   information   systems   (GIS),   the   Web,   and   most   recently,   the   Geoweb   and   volunteered   geographic  information  (VGI)  systems.   3.2.1  Geographic  Information  Systems  and  Participatory  GIS   In   the   early   1960s,   Roger   Tomlinson   discovered   the   value   of   digitizing   and   overlaying   various   layers   of   information   (e.g.,   forest   areas,   soil   types,   farmland,   etc.)   to   assist   the   Canadian   government   in   land   use   planning.   This   early   `computer-aided   cartography'   quickly   evolved   into   an   entire   system   of   managing   geographic   information   (Tomlinson,   1968)   and   later   evolved   into   a   domain   of   science   known   as   GIScience   (Goodchild,  1992;  Rhind,  1977).  Goodchild  (2008)  highlighted  that  the  analytical  functions   of   GIS   (such   as   spatial   analysis,   modeling,   and   geostatistical   techniques)   is   what   made   it   such  a  powerful  tool,  revealing  insights  not  otherwise  evident.   Central  to  GIS  are  data.  Data  with  geographically  determined  interest  have  "patterns   that  are  well  behaved  and  therefore  amenable  to  modeling;  and  of  sufficient  variability  to   impact   locational   decisions"   (Goodchild,   1997,   p.   387).   The   data   plugged   into   GIS   are   particularly  useful  for  presenting  complex  spatial  information  in  a  visual  and  engaging  way,   and  analyzing  spatial  trends.  Maps  produced  using  GIS  software  (such  as  ArcMap,  MapInfo,   and  increasingly  open  source  options  such  as  Quantum  GIS)  are  used  prolifically  in  urban   planning,   environmental   management,   demographics,   and   community   planning.   Most      31  

   often,  the  outcome  of  this  process  is  a  static  map,  which  can  be  printed  and  used  in  reports,   planning   documents,   or   internal   use.   Alternatively,   it   can   be   uploaded   online   so   a   wider   audience   can   access   the   map.   It   is   often   professionals   with   high-level   skills   and   training   creating   traditional   GIS   maps,   and   its   use   is   limited   to   the   domain   of   larger   institutional   settings  (e.g.,  government  and  academic).   Owing   to   this   strongly   professional   and   authoritative   control   of   GIS   mapping,   participatory   GIS   (PGIS)   emerged   from   critiques   of   GIS   in   the   1990s,   calling   for   more   inclusive   use   of   GIS   that   engages   and   empowers   the   public   while   developing   more   sustainable   community   driven   GIS   practices   (Brown,   2012;   Pickles,   1995;   Sieber,   2006).   The  value  of  participatory  mapping  is  rooted  in  the  profound  knowledge  local  citizens  have   about  their  community;  knowledge  that  is  typically  underrepresented,  if  represented  at  all,   in   official   plans,   policies,   and   maps.   The   knowledge   acquired   through   the   process   of   participatory   mapping   helps   local   committees,   councils,   NGOs,   and   policy-   and   decision- makers   know   what   community   initiatives   need   to   be   supported,   fostered,   and   enhanced,   while   identifying   strengths   within   the   community.   The   early   work   in   PGIS   was   further   advanced   with   Web-based   technological   development   that   ultimately   enabled   greater   engagement  within  the  mapping  process.   3.2.2  Web  2.0   The   first   inception   of   the   World   Wide   Web,   or   what   some   refer   to   as   Web   1.0,   enabled   a   one-way   flow   of   information   from   producer   to   consumer.   The   content   on   the   Web  was  created  by  few  and  consumed  by  many,  and  used  primarily  as  a  tool  for  extracting   information  (Batty,  Hudson-Smith,  Milton,  &  Crooks,  2010).  This  early  version  of  the  Web   relied  on  formal  organizations,  such  as  government  and  academic  institutions,  to  produce   Web  content.   With   the   new   millennium   came   the   development   of   the   second   generation   of   the   World   Wide   Web,   dubbed   Web   2.0.   Web   2.0   technologies   enabled   a   two-way   flow   of   information   between   producers   and   users,   allowing   users   to   create   content,   as   well   as   extract   information   (Batty   et   al.,   2010).   Dodge   &   Kitchin   (2013)   referred   to   this   as   the   read+write   media.   The   broad   public,   who   was   once   the   target   of   Web   content,   began      32

   In   addition   to   making   mapping   applications   a   ubiquitous   part   of   life,   it   has   been   asserted   that   the   pervasive   nature   of   the   Geoweb   is   "rapidly   altering   the   ways   in   which   we   interact   with   not   only   one   another   but   indeed   interact   with,   experience,   and   build   attachments  to  space/place"  (Leszczynski  &  Wilson,  2013,  p.  916).  As  an  example,  we  are   no  longer  using  a  map  to  just  locate  a  local  café;  instead,  we  are  reading  reviews  about  that   café,   checking   in   and   sharing   our   location   and   experience   using   Facebook   or   Foursquare,   tweeting,  and  blogging  about  our  experience  at  that  location.  This  is  creating  a  new   spatial   media,   one   in   which   the   mediating   technologies   are   enabling,   extending,   and   enhancing   the   ability   for   citizens   to   engage   with   geographic   information   online   (Crampton,   2009;   Elwood   &  Leszczynski,  2013;  Leszczynski  &  Wilson,  2013).  As  such,  the  Geoweb  has  the  potential  to   significantly   increase   citizen   interaction   with   both   spaces   and   places   through   mapping   and   geographic  information.   3.2.4  VGI  Systems   Building  on  the  increasingly  interactive  nature  of  the  Geoweb  and  rapidly  expanding   location-enabled  technologies,  engaged  citizens  and  stakeholders  are  increasingly  creating   a   type   of   spatially   explicit   user-generated   content,   known   as   volunteered   geographic   information   (VGI).   Initially   coined   by   Goodchild   (2007),   VGI   has   also   been   described   as   user-generated   geographic   content   (Goodchild,   2008)   and   crowdsourced   geospatial   data   (Crampton,   2009).   The   spatial   attribute   of   VGI   can   be   geographically   explicit,   such   as   geographic   coordinates   of   a   building,   or   geographically   implicit,   such   as   the   name   and   intersection  of  that  building  (Haklay,  2013a).  Contributions  also  vary  by  type,  ranging  from   geographic   coordinates,   geotagged   photos,   location-enabled   tweets   and   Facebook   posts,   and  comments  on  mapped  content  (Rinner  and  Fast,  2014;  Rinner  and  Bird,  2009).     While   the   development   of   VGI   systems   are   still   in   their   infancy   (Fast   &   Rinner,   2014),   much   research   is   dedicated   to   quality,   completeness,   accuracy,   social   impact,   and   contributor  motivations  (Coleman  et  al.,  2009;  Flanagin  &  Metzger,  2008;  Goodchild  &  Li,   2012).  Further,  the  process  of  creating  VGI  can,  in  some  instances,  act  as  a  mechanism  to   engage  stakeholders.  VGI  systems  represent  a  new  form  of  knowledge  production  that  taps   into   the   networked   publics   to   build   new   spatial   narratives   (Lin,   2013).   Dodge   &   Kitchin      34  

   (2013)  explored  how  the  notion  of  crowdsourced  cartography  is  radically  transforming  the   process   of   making   and   using   maps;   crowdsourcing   is   quickly   becoming   a   dominant   form   of   geographic  knowledge  production  and  its  implications  are  just  starting  to  be  realized.   The   cumulative   impact   of   GIS,   Web   2.0,   the   Geoweb,   and   VGI   systems   enables   various   levels   of   engagement   in   the   mapping   process   across   a   wide   range   of   application   areas.   The   remainder   of   this   paper   examines   these   mapping   developments   as   they   have   been   applied   to   food   system   mapping,   in   an   effort   to   understand   if   and   how   mapping   facilitates  engagement  across  the  range  of  food  stakeholders.  

3.3  Analyzing  Stakeholder  Engagement  in  Food  Mapping    
These  mapping  advancements  have  translated  into  impactful  food  mapping  projects,   which   have   been   applied   in   innovative   ways   to   communicate   the   intricacies   of   decentralized  and  location-dependent  food  places.  To  facilitate  a  greater  understanding  of   the  range  of  food  mapping  projects,  this  paper  categorizes  them  according  to  the  role  that   food   stakeholders   play   in   creating   the   map.   In   particular,   it   is   valuable   to   borrow   from   Arnstein's  (1969)  "Ladder  of  Citizen  Participation,"  which  serves  as  a  powerful  framework   symbolizing   the   level   of   influence   citizens   have   on   government   decision-making.   On   Arnstein's   ladder,   each   rung   corresponds   to   a   higher   level   of   meaningful   citizen   participation   in   government   programs.   While   the   ladder   has   been   repurposed   in   other   disciplines,  the  concept  (rather  than  the  rungs  specified  by  Arnstein)  is  particularly  useful   to   understand   the   rungs   of   stakeholder   engagement   in   mapping.   Fast   and   Rinner   (2014)   suggest   that   new   mapping   technologies--introduced   above   as   the   GIS,   Web   2.0,   Geoweb   and   VGI   systems--enable   stakeholders   to   achieve   greater   engagement,   or   a   higher   rung   on   the   ladder   of   citizen   participation.   While   inspired   by   Arnstein's   ladder,   we   adapted   the   rungs   to   relate   to   mapping   food   places,   and   categorized   them   as   visualization,   collaboration,  interaction,  and  participation  (Figure  3.1).

Figure  3.1:  The  ladder  of  stakeholder  engagement  in  food  mapping   3.3.1  Visualize  and  Analyze   Traditional  GIS  mapping  and  analysis  have  been  used  to  understand  the  `spaces'  of   local   food;   that   is,   the   analysis   of   a   particular   location.   These   maps   can   be   incredibly   informative  for  visualizing  and  analyzing  spatial  patterns  of  food  environments.  These  food   environments   range   from   the   global   through   to   the   local.   The   examples   of   traditional   GIS   mapping   are   typically   presented   as   static   maps,   which   can   either   be   hardcopy   (e.g.,   printed   in   a   report   or   journal)   or   digital   (e.g.,   uploaded   to   the   Web).   They   are   considered   `read- only'   material.   Creating   a   traditional   map   requires   GIS   software   and   knowledge   of   cartography   and   spatial   analysis,   which   typically   limit   them   to   institutional   settings   (e.g.,   government,  academic).  Most  often,  actors  within  these  institutions  use  the  maps  internally   to  support  knowledge  sharing  and  evidence-based  decision-making.   Given   the   high   level   of   skills   and   software   required   to   make   these   maps,   the   visualization   and   analysis   enabled   by   these   maps   is   at   the   bottom   of   the   ladder   for   engagement.   However,   the   importance   of   traditional   maps   in   visualizing   and   analyzing   complex   interactions   within   local   food   systems   cannot   be   understated.   They   provide   valuable   support   for   policy   and   decision-making,   playing   a   central   role   in   planning,   zoning,      36  

   and  policy  documents.  Given  the  institutional  support  infrastructure  (i.e.,  GIS  departments   within   government)   and   familiarity   working   with   traditional   static   maps,   they   represent   the  most  prevalent  rung  on  the  ladder  of  stakeholder  engagement  in  local  food  systems.   3.3.1.1  Global  Analysis  of  Food  Production   Martellozzo   et   al.   (2014)   conducted   a   global   analysis   of   geographic   space   constraints  by  calculating  how  much  food  urban  areas  can  produce.  These  advanced  spatial   analysis  techniques  revealed  that,  for  example,  Canada  is  more  than  capable  of  producing   urban   food   due   to   the   comparatively   high   proportion   of   urban   land   that   is   suitable   for   vegetable   production.   However,   because   of   the   global   scale,   this   analysis   is   unable   to   identify  individual  parcels  or  even  regions  that  are  suitable  for  urban  food  production.   GIS   and   spatial   analysis   have   also   been   applied   to   foodshed   mapping,   which   reconstructs   the   geography  of  where  food  comes  from  in  relation  to  where  it  is  consumed  (Feagan,  2007).   Foodshed  analysis,  in  particular,  helps  examine  the  impact  long  distance  global  foodsheds   have   on   food   security   and   environmental   sustainability   in   the   context   of   global   climate   change.  Interestingly,  multiple  studies  have  indicated  that  shifting  food  choices  away  from   meat   and   dairy   toward   a   plant-based   diet,   rather   than   reducing   food-miles,   provides   the   best   opportunities   for   reducing   greenhouse   gas   emissions   and   making   agricultural   production   more   sustainable   (Edwards-Jones   et   al.,   2008;   Garnett,   2012;   Peters,   Bills,   Wilkins,  &  Fick,  2008;  Weber  &  Matthews,  2008).   3.3.1.2  Local  Analysis  of  Food  Deserts   Spatial   analysis   is   particularly   helpful   in   analyzing   the   presence   and   prevalence   of   food  deserts,  understood  as  a  geographic  area  with  limited  access  to  (healthy)  food,  such  as   supermarkets,   farmers'   markets,   and   other   food   providers   (Baker   et   al.,   2010).   For   example,   Wilson   and   Mckenzie   (2014)   combined   neighbourhood   risk   factors   (e.g.,   low   income,  unemployment,  and  low  education)  with  a  spatially-derived  analysis  of  poor  access   to   food   provisions   in   the   isolated   northern   city   of   Thunder   Bay,   Ontario.   The   study   identified   two   food   deserts   that   persisted   across   the   Statistics   Canada   1996,   2001,   and   2006   Census   of   Canada.   Morrison,   Nelson,   and   Ostry   (2011)   also   used   the   Canadian   census   to   map   local   food   production   capacity.   Using   the   Moran's   I   spatial   autocorrelation      37  

   technique,   the   authors   found   that   farmland   is   significantly   clustered   throughout   British   Columbia,  Canada,  and  given  these  findings,  estimates  of  provincial  food  self-sufficiency  can   be  devised.  In  the  context  of  linking  food  environments  to  health,  Ball  and  Thornton  (2013,   p.  1147)  reviewed  mapping  initiatives  that  describe  "food  environments  in  varied  settings   ­  within  neighbourhoods,  supermarkets,  and  dining  venues  near  educational  institutions."   Analyzing  food  environments  is  a  necessary  step  in  building  evidence  to  inform  decision- making  that  supports  more  resilient  global  and  local  food  systems.   3.3.2  Collaborate   While   there   is   no   doubt   that   the   diverse   and   hyper-local   actions   of   food   system   stakeholders   can   have   a   profound   impact   on   food   systems   (Macias,   2008;   Scharf   et   al.,   2010),   collaboration   is   the   next   rung   to   realizing   the   collective   strength   of   local   food   systems.  As  such,  many  of  the  individuals  and  groups  working  toward  resilient  local  food   systems   in   isolation   are   now   acting   together   to   achieve   a   collective   impact.   Guelph   Wellbeing's   (2014,   p.   6)   report   on   food   security   defines   collective   impact   as   "the   commitment   of   a   group   of   people   from   different   sectors   that   form   a   common   agenda   for   solving   a   complex   social   problem.   To   achieve   large   scale,   lasting   solutions   for   social   problems  sectors  such  as  government,  civil  society,  and  business  need  to  coordinate  their   efforts  and  work  together  toward  a  clearly  defined  goal."  As  such,  food  system  actors  are   responding  to  the  urgent  need  to  collaborate  to  strengthen  local  food  systems.   Collaboration   within   the   food   system   has   taken   many   forms   over   the   years.   A   prominent   non-spatial   example--that   is,   collaboration   not   requiring   mapping--is   community  food  assessments.  Recognizing  the  need  to  foster  stronger  local  food  systems,   the   Community   Food   Security   Coalition   developed   a   (non-spatial)   systemic   community   food   assessment   guide   to   support   a   wide   range   of   integrated   food   system   approaches   (Pothukuchi   et   al.,   2002).   The   guide   emphasized   that   the   direct   participation   by   citizens   and  food  stakeholders--including  private,  not-for-profit,  academic,  and  public  sectors--is   vital  for  communities  to  accurately  examine  the  broad  range  of  food  initiatives  and  assets.   Adding   to   this,   Mcgarry,   Cowan,   &   Alencar   (2008)   see   the   Web,   and   Web   2.0   more

   specifically,   as   a   technological   development   that   enables   an   innovative   approach   for   greater  collective  impact,  or  what  they  define  as  `collaborative  innovation'.   Collaborative   food   mapping,   and   the   collaborative   rung   defined   in   this   paper,   are   characterized  by  the  sharing  of  spatial  data  and  maps  amongst  food  system  stakeholders.   Projects   are   often   initiated   to   address   inter-   and   intra-organizational   interactions,   and   bring  together  data  contributed  by  public  and  private  communities.  While  these  mapping   projects  focus  on  compiling  diverse  data  sources  on  local  food  value  chains  to  make  static   maps   using   traditional   GIS,   effectively   encouraging   greater   collaboration   among   food   system  stakeholders,  they  do  not  provide  a  mechanism  for  interactive  engagement  with  the   mapped   data.   While   collaborative   mapping   projects   demonstrate   innovative   approaches   to   data   sharing   across   a   broad   range   of   food   system   stakeholders,   the   map   making   is   controlled  by  a  select  few,  likely  with  GIS  or  information  management  training.  The  project   is  limited  to  static  maps,  and  the  collaborative  database  is  difficult  to  keep  up  to  date.  Thus,   this   rung   represents   a   collaborative   database   but   is   limited   to   static   maps.   The   following   three  examples  highlight  notable  collaborative  food  mapping  projects.   3.3.2.1  Good  Food  for  London  Map   The   Good   Food   for   London   (England)   map   series   is   led   by   the   Sustain   Alliance   for   better   food   and   farming,   in   collaboration   with   a   wide   range   of   food   stakeholders:   Marine   Conservation   Society,   Certified   Sustainable   Seafood,   Organic   Soil   Association,   Chartered   Institute   for   Environmental   Health,   Fairtrade,   London   Food   Link,   Compassion   in   World   Farming,  and  the  Mayor's  Food  Strategy  (Sustain,  2013).  The  purpose  of  the  map  series  is   to  rate  how  well  individual  Boroughs  in  London  are  supporting  a  healthy  and  sustainable   food  future  (Sonnino  &  Spade,  2014).  Each  Borough  is  rated  across  six  food  issues:   · · · Community  Food  Growing   Food  in  Life  in  Schools   Fairtrade  Food   · · · Sustainable  Fish   Animal  Welfare   Healthier  Catering  

The   collective   score   indicates   each   Borough's   overall   ability   to   lead   in   sustainable   food  initiatives.  This  `fame  and  shame'  map  has  motivated  many  food  system  stakeholders   in   each   Borough,   from   politicians   to   civilians,   to   put   healthy,   sustainable,   and   resilient   food      39  

   systems   on   their   agendas.   In   fact,   between   the   2011   to   2013   editions   of   the   map,   most   Boroughs   have   significantly   increased   their   overall   score   (Sustain,   2013).   Further   to   the   collaboration   generated   by   these   maps,   it   is   the   onus   of   the   decision-makers   responsible   for   food   planning   to   submit,   update,   and   correct   the   information   presented   for   their   Borough.  The  process  of  contributing  to  this  mapping  initiative  is  putting  food  on  the  radar   for  many  local  politicians  who  prefer  to  avoid  a  public  shaming.   3.3.2.2  Collaborative  Asset  Mapping   Part   of   broader   regional   food   system   planning,   the   Golden   Horseshoe   Food   And   Farming   Alliance   (GHFFA)   is   a   partnership   of   local   food   stakeholders   in   the   Toronto   and   Hamilton,   Ontario,   area,   including   provincial,   regional,   and   municipal   governments,   the   Toronto   Region   Conservation   Authority,   and   Friends   of   the   Greenbelt   (Walton,   2012).   As   part   of   the   GHFFA   Grow  the  Cluster   pillar   of   the   Alliance's   Action   Plan,   an   "asset   mapping   project   was   initiated   to   establish   an   understanding   of   agri-food   assets   across   the   Golden   Horseshoe  area"  (Horner,  2013).     Collaborative   asset   mapping   (CAM)   is   becoming   popular   among   food   system   stakeholders.   CAM   "not   only   builds   a   database   of   available   assets   among   individuals   and   organizations  in  the  community,  but  the  process  facilitates  relationship-building,  increased   common   ground,   and   awareness   about   assets   (resources)   which   could   potentially   contribute   to   prevention/mitigation,   preparedness,   response   or   recovery   activities"   (Sullivan,  Corneil,  Kuziemsky,  Louise,  &  McCrann,  2013,  p.  4).   The   GHFFA   made   a   significant   investment   in   a   regional   collaborative   food   asset   mapping   project   in   order   to   identify,   inventory,   and   profile   the   food   and   farming   assets,   which   includes   the   products   grown,   harvested,   and   processed   locally;   and   the   business,   education,   research,   development,   and   institution   services   that   develop   and   support   food   and   farming   infrastructure.   Through   this   initiative,   the   GHFFA   is   able   to   analyze   the   strengths,  weaknesses,  gaps,  and  opportunities  to  foster  a  more  resilient  and  robust  food   system  regionally.

   3.3.2.3  Food:  An  Atlas   An   atlas   aggregates   individual   maps   into   a   collection   of   maps   with   a   common   purpose,   allowing   the   examination   of   phenomena   across   a   range   of   locations,   scales,   and   themes.  The  Gorilla  Food  Atlas  assembled  traditional  maps,  infographics,  and  map  art  from   a  wide  spectrum  of  food  mapping  initiatives,  transforming  the  individual  stories  about  the   food   system   into   a   collective   narrative.   The   atlas   was   compiled   by   Guerrilla   Cartography,   with  the  support  of  an  impressive  list  of  collaborators;  interestingly,  this  project  gathered   contributions   from   over   120   collaborators,   employing   both   crowdsourcing   and   crowdfunding  techniques  to  complete  the  atlas  (D.  Jensen  &  Roy,  2013).   The   maps   in   the   atlas   visualize,   for   example,   the   imbalance   of   the   availability   of   nutritious  food,  commercial  pressures  on  land  for  sale  in  Africa,  Canadian  food  networks,   San  Francisco's  food  system  climate  adaptations  and,  food  swamps  in  various  regional  food   systems.   Broadly,   the   maps   cover   global   to   local   scales   and   are   organized   into   food   production,   distribution,   security,   exploration,   and   food   identity   categories.   Collectively,   the   maps   tell   an   unparalleled   story   of   the   natural   resources,   political   processes,   institutions,  and  individuals  contributing  to  a  resilient  food  system  (D.  Jensen  &  Roy,  2013).   3.3.3  Interact   The  data  collected  from  collaborative  projects  is  taken  a  rung  higher  when  it  is  put   into   an   interactive   online   Web   mapping   environment.   Food   related   interactive   maps   compile   diverse   datasets--such   as   those   gathered   through   internal   data   collection,   collaborative   mapping   initiatives,   and   open   data   portals--and   present   them   using   the   Geoweb.   Within   the   last   decade,   the   increasing   number   of   free,   open-source   Geoweb   options   had   led   to   a   significant   expansion   of   food-related   online   interactive   mapping   applications.   These   applications   range   from   simple   map   mashups   (combining   a   geographic   dataset   with   an   existing   mapping   interface)   to   custom-built   mapping   environments.   Interactive   mapping   environments   enable   more   people,   ranging   from   those   involved   in   collaborative   mapping   projects   and   the   general   public   alike,   to   interact   with   the   mapped   data.   In   essence,   making   collaborative   mapping   available   to   the   public   through   an   interactive  web-based  map  environment  qualifies  this  rung  on  the  ladder.      41  

   3.3.3.1  Google  Maps  Mashup:  Durham  Farm  Fresh  Map   Since   Google   released   its   Application   Programming   Interface   (API)   in   2005,   users   have  been  able  to  overlay  customized  (spatial)  data  with  Google's  mapping  software  (Batty   et  al.,  2010).  The  resulting  map  mashup  can  be  embedded  on  a  website  and  shared  publicly.   The   advantage   of   Google   Maps   API   is   that   most   users   are   comfortable   using   the   Google   Maps   base   map,   it   is   mobile   friendly,   and   relatively   easy   to   build   a   custom   application,   despite   limits   on   daily   page   views   (Yu,   Benatallah,   Casati,   &   Daniel,   2008).   Map   mashups   are   readily   used   on   websites   maintained   by   governments,   NGOs,   and   other   food   system   stakeholders  in  order  to  share  spatial  information--such  as  the  location  of  farms,  farmers'   markets,  or  community  gardens--with  a  broader  public.     Durham  Farm  Fresh,  for  example,  maintains  a  map-based  directory  of  food  and  farm   resources  in  Durham  Region,  Ontario  ("Durham  Farm  Fresh  Map,"  2015).  This  online  map   serves   as   a   spatial   directory   of   food   resources   within   the   region,   as   part   of   a   broader   regional  food  marketing  strategy.  This  mapping  example,  classified  on  the  `interact'  rung  of   the   ladder,   does   not   require   a   collaborative   dataset   but   is   placed   above   the   `collaborate'   rung   because   the   public   has   access   to   the   data   and   the   maps,   leading   to   the   potential   for   broader  public  engagement.   3.3.3.2  Custom-Built  Geoweb  Environments:  Maryland  Food  Map   Google   Maps   has   dominated   as   the   most   widely   used   and   accessible   option   for   creating   a   simple   Web   map   since   its   launch   in   2005.   However,   there   has   been   a   surge   of   free   and   open   source   software   for   geo-applications   such   as   OpenLayers,   Leaflet,   and   CartoDB   (Crampton,   2009;   Haklay   et   al.,   2008).   These   constantly   developing   mapping   software   options   enable   custom-built   Geoweb   environments.   While   the   customization   options  are  expanding  daily,  developing  a  sophisticated  Geoweb  application  requires  a  high   level  of  programming  and  technical  skills.  Thus,  developing  a  Geoweb  application  is  often   limited  to  public  or  private  agencies  that  have  both  budgetary  and  technical  support.  While   steep   barriers   exist   to   the   development   of   the   Geoweb,   the   resulting   applications   are   available   through   a   simple   Web   browser   and   thus,   more   easily   accessible   for   public   use.

   The   increased   popularity   and   prevalence   of   the   Geoweb   means   more   people   are   developing,  deploying,  and  using  the  applications  to  support  food  mapping.   A   custom-built   Geoweb   designed   specifically   for   food   is   the   Maryland   Food   Map.   Developed  by  the  John  Hopkins  Centre  for  a  Livable  Future,  which  is  part  of  the  Bloomberg   School  of  Public  Health  in  Baltimore,  Maryland,  in  collaboration  with  Towson  University's   Centre   for   GIS,   the   interactive   mapping   tool   designed   to   explore   the   many   facets   of   Maryland's   food   system.   Gathering   information   from   a   wide   range   of   contributors-- including   government   data,   project   partner   data,   and   primary   data   collection--the   tool   is   a   collective  resource  used  to  examine  all  aspects  of  the  food  system.  The  map  includes  data   on   how   food   is   grown,   distributed,   processed,   retailed,   and   consumed.   Users   can   add   or   remove   data   from   the   hundreds   of   data   layers,   adjust   the   geographic   area   and   the   zoom   level,  and  query  the  mapped  data.  Further,  both  pre-made  maps  and  select  data  layers  can   be   downloaded   and   used   to   support   work   beyond   the   interactive   map.   For   example,   this   initiative   has   been   used   to   successfully   support   city   planning,   grant   proposals,   and   academic  research  (Maryland  Food  System  Map,  2015).  In  addition  to  the  benefits  derived   by   the   map,   the   momentum   around   the   project,   including   social   media   outreach   and   community   events,   is   becoming   a   resource   for   both   the   local   and   international   food   community.   3.3.4  Participate   On  the  highest  rung  of  the  ladder  for  engagement  in  food  mapping  is  participation.   Many   local   food   system   initiatives   already   recognize   the   value   of   citizen   participation.   In   fact,   the   field   of   `agroecology'   is   fuelled   by   a   participatory   action   approach   to   resilient   food   systems  (Méndez,  Bacon,  &  Cohen,  2013).  Levkoe  (2006)  explored  how  participants  in  local   food   justice   movements--mainly   the   Stop   Community   Food   Centre's   Urban   Agriculture   program   based   in   Toronto,   Ontario--can   democratize   the   forces   that   control   the   food   system.   While   simultaneously   strengthening   their   individual   knowledge   and   community   engagement,  participants  also  learn  about  the  social,  political,  and  legal  systems  in  which   they  operate  (Levkoe,  2006).

   Similarly,   participation   in   the   mapping   process   is   also   well   established   in   the   participatory   GIS   (PGIS)   literature.   However,   PGIS   initially   revolved   around   traditional   (GIS)  mapping  practices,  and  was  coined  long  before  user-generated  content,  the  Geoweb,   or  volunteered  geographic  information  (VGI)  systems  were  a  common  part  of  the  process.   These   recent   mapping   developments   can   enable   greater   participation   among   the   community  of  food  system  stakeholders.   In  order  to  understand  the  levels  of  participation  enabled  by  more  recent  mapping   methods,   it   is   useful   to   learn   from   Haklay's   (2013)   levels   of   participation   in   geographical   citizen   science   projects.   Geographical   citizen   science,   which   is   closely   related   to   VGI,   involves   citizen   participation   to   collect,   process,   and/or   analyze   spatial   data   as   part   of   a   broader   scientific   inquiry.   Adopting   Haklay's   ladder   to   food   mapping,   the   levels-- crowdsourcing,   distributed   intelligence,   participatory   science,   and   extreme   citizen   science--are   incorporated   in   the   highest   rung   of   the   stakeholder   engagement   in   food   mapping  ladder  to  help  delineate  the  array  of  participation  types  in  food  mapping  (Figure   3.2).   Progressing   up   this   ladder   necessitates   more   meaningful   engagement   among   food   stakeholders;  however,  it  is  also  typified  by  a  smaller  number  of  people  engaged,  especially   compared   to   the   interactive   rung   on   the   ladder.   The   following   section   introduces   and   presents  mapping  examples  within  each  level.

   3.3.4.1  Crowdsourcing   At   the   bottom   of   the   ladder   of   participation   (level   one),   the   professional   scientists   define   the   scope   of   a   project   while   location   data   (e.g.,   GPS)   are   passively   crowdsourced   from  the  public.  The  sensor  network,  which  can  be  carried  by  humans,  animals,  or  vehicles,   capture   measurements   from   the   local   environment   and   are   reported   back   for   further   interpretation   or   analysis   (Goodchild,   2007).   This   type   of   sensing   leverages   information   communication   technology,   including   mobile   phone   and   social   media   networks.   An   example   of   this   would   be   streaming   geo-located   Twitter   data   to   detect   where   people   are   tweeting   about   #LocalFood   (Fast,   2015).   While   crowdsourced   passive   participation   has   been   used   to   map   land   use   (Vaz   &   Arsanjani,   2015),   which   has   implications   on   how   land   is   assessed  and  managed  for  future  food  planning,  it  is  not  currently  well  established  in  food   mapping.   3.3.4.2  Distributed  Intelligence   Level   two   requires   the   location   data   and   the   knowledge   from   the   participant.   According  to  Resch  (2013),  this  can  also  be  defined  as  citizens  as  sensors  or  participatory   sensing,   as   opposed   to   a   sensor   network,   since   the   contextual   intelligence   and   personal   knowledge  is  central  to  the  volunteered  contribution.  Alternatively,  Rinner  and  Fast  (2014)   define  this  level  as  `citizens  as  reporters'.  As  such,  projects  of  this  nature  rely  on  volunteers   to   interpret   what   they   sense   and   report   it   as   an   observation   (Goodchild,   2007).   For   example,   the   PlantWatch   program   engages   all   Canadians   to   collect   scientific   information   about   plant   bloom   times   to   help   scientists   understand   the   changing   environment   (Beaubien   &   Hamann,   2011).   PlantWatch   goes   beyond   crowdsourcing   by   using   the   local   knowledge   of   plant   enthusiasts   to   correctly   identify   a   plant,   in   addition   to   reporting   its   location   and   bloom   time.   Additionally,   Werts,   Mikhailova,   Post,   and   Sharp   (2012)   also   relied   on   the   distributed   intelligence   of   participants   to   engage   in   soil   and   water   conservation   efforts   mediated   through   an   online   mapping   environment.   These   projects,   and   the   participation   enabled   within,   provide   timely   data   that   would   otherwise   be   unavailable  to  scientists  and  decision-makers.

   3.3.4.3  Participatory  Science   Level   three   requires   a   greater   level   of   participation   from   the   citizen   group,   where   they  are  included  in  decisions  about  project  scope  and  data  input,  management,  analysis,  or   presentation  (Haklay,  2013a;  Resch,  2013).  For  example,  the  Rainforest  Foundation  UK  is  a   not-for-profit   agency   working   to   protect   rainforest   ecosystems   (including   their   food   generating   capacity)   by   supporting   the   participation   of   indigenous   and   forest   communities   in  governance  and  management.  In  partnership  with  the  Mapping  For  Rights  organization,   they   led   the   development   of   an   interactive   Geoweb   environment   that   directly   gathers   contributions   from   over   300   forest   communities.   While   the   community   members   are   using   GPS   and   other   innovative   mapping   methodologies   to   actively   participate   in   the   mapping   component   of   the   project,   the   Foundation   is   central   in   leading   and   managing   the   project;   further,   the   agencies,   not   the   citizens,   typically   use   the   maps   as   evidence   to   inform   rainforest  management  (The  Rainforest  Foundation,  2014).   3.3.4.4  Extreme  Citizen  Science   Level  four  goes  beyond  mandating  citizen  participation  by  giving  actors  the  agency   to  define  the  problem,  question,  and  scope  of  the  project  (Haklay,  2013a).  In  this  instance,   citizen   stakeholders   work   together   toward   a   common   goal   to   reflect   the   collective   experience,   knowledge,   and   values   of   the   community.   The   community   initiates   and   manages   the   project,   and   uses   the   outcome   to   inform   decision-making.   Given   the   community   nature   of   these   projects   and   minimal   (or   non-existent)   institutional   support   (e.g.,  government  or  university),  these  extreme  citizen  science  projects  are  typically  smaller   in   scale   and   employ   simple,   yet   effective,   tools   for   the   collection   and   management   of   geographic   information,   such   as   balloon   mapping.   Again,   there   is   a   high   level   of   engagement  among  participants,  but  a  low  number  of  participants.   For   example,   recognizing   that   the   proximity   to   (fecal)   contamination   is   a   serious   aspect   of   food   insecurity   in   Mathare,   Nairobi,   the   Kenyan   Federation   of   the   Urban   Poor   initiated   the   mapping   of   food   environments   and   environmental   hazards   (Ahmed   et   al.,   2014).  The  community-led  mapping  team,  with  support  from  the  International  Institute  for   Environment   and   Development   and   University   College   London,   used   inexpensive   balloon      46  

   mapping   to   get   detailed   aerial   imagery   that   parallels   more   expensive   and   inaccessible   satellite   imagery.   The   community   then   created   a   consolidated   database   of   the   food   environment,   and   maps   of   food   vendors,   food   types,   and   physical   structures   within   the   slums.   The   mapping   process   encouraged   discussion   between   food   vendors,   livestock   owners,   consumers,   and   residents,   and   created   an   up-to-date   resource   to   support   the   community's  negotiation  with  officials  over  infrastructure  and  policy  development  (Ahmed   et  al.,  2014;  Tacoli,  2014).     In   this   and   other   cases   of   community-led   participatory   mapping,   the   project   was   initiated   out   of   necessity   (i.e.,   to   acquire   information   to   reduce   contamination)   with   bottom-up  organization..  Unfortunately,  without  the  direct  involvement  of  decision-makers   or   other   officials,   the   outcomes   of   the   mapping   project   can   be   limited   by   the   choice   of   officials   to   uptake,   or   reject,   the   data.   Beyond   formal   decision-making   channels,   however,   the  community  can  use  the  data  to  influence  their  own  decision-making.  

3.4  Sharing  Data,  Mediating  Knowledge  
This   paper   served   to   highlight   unique   mapping   initiatives   broadly   related   to   food   systems.  They  present  interesting  cases  where  various  levels  of  engagement  were  sought,   and   in   these   notable   cases,   achieved.   Based   on   what   has   gone   on   to   date,   and   the   cases   chosen   here,   it   is   clear   that   more   people   are   engaged   in   the   mapping   process   than   ever   before.   Interestingly,   paralleling   the   trend   of   greater   engagement   as   food   mapping   projects   progress  up  the  rungs  of  stakeholder  engagement,  there  is  greater  evidence  of  the  sharing   of  data.   On   the   first   rung   of   the   ladder,   simple   visualization   and   analysis   projects   rely   on   authoritative  datasets;  those  collected  by  national  mapping  agencies,  research  projects,  or   increasingly  from  open  data  portals.  Analysis  of  food  production  and  food  deserts  examples   explored   in   this   paper   relies   on   government   census   data   as   their   primary   data   source.   This   is  a  typical  one-way  data  flow;  agencies  collect,  manage,  and  selectively  distribute  data  to   the  public.  The  push  for  open  data  means  these  data  are  expanding,  but  typically  focus  on   government   sources   rather   than   data   available   among   stakeholder   groups.   As   previously   discussed,  traditional  GIS  maps  remain  a  suitable  and  often  preferable  in  decision-making      47  

   because   of   their   authoritative   nature   and   concise   presentation   of   information   to   support   decision-making.   The   collaborative   mapping   projects,   on   the   second   rung,   require   the   sharing   of   datasets   between   and   among   food   system   stakeholders,   which   is   something   the   recent   trend   toward   open   data   does   not   capture.   The   Good   Food   for   London   map,   the   Golden   Horseshoe   Food   and   Farming   Alliance   collaborative   asset   mapping   project,   and   Gorilla   Food   Atlas   collected   data   from   engaged   stakeholders   from   municipal   government,   food- related   NGOs,   and   academic   projects,   respectively.   Based   on   this   work,   great   projects   are   achieved  when  there  is  sharing  amongst  engaged  stakeholders.  However,  the  data  used  in   these  projects  are  not  considered  open  and,  thus,  not  accessible  to  the  public  in  their  raw   form   or   in   some   cases   the   reports   and   maps   are   not   available   publically.   While   more   governments  are  sharing  their  data  than  ever  before,  there  is  still  much  work  to  be  done   related  to  open  data  policies  (Scassa,  2014;  van  Loenen  &  Onsrud,  2004).  Few  stakeholder   groups  have  open  data  policies;  most  maintain  control  and  limit  access  to  their  databases.   The  sooner  food  stakeholders  start  equally  and  openly  sharing  their  data,  the  greater  the   chances  of  fostering  collaboration.   Interactive   mapping   projects   are   a   step   higher   because   they   make   collaborative   datasets   available   online,   engaging   more   people   with   Web-wide   dissemination.   Relatively   few   of   these   interactive   maps   even   make   the   data   downloadable   to   the   public.   The   increasing   ease   of   use   of   the   Geoweb   (not   to   be   mistaken   for   ease   of   application   development)   means   more   people   are   creating   maps   with   their   own   in-house   datasets,   expanding   the   mapping   capabilities   of   small   NGOs   and   community   groups   who   had   limited   mapping  capacity  previously.   At   the   highest   rung,   data   sharing   is   completely   flipped.   The   public   is   creating   the   data,  to  varying  degrees  of  passive  to  active  participation.  Since  crowdsourcing  enabled  the   (engaged)  public  to  contribute  geographic  information,  citizens  are  playing  a  greater  role  in   the   knowledge   creation   process.   This   engagement   not   only   transforms   the   role   of   the   citizen,   but   also   the   role   and   responsibilities   of   scientists   (Haklay,   2013).   Lauriault   &   Mooney   (2014)   emphasized   that   scientists   need   to   learn   how   to   be   the   mediator   of   knowledge,   rather   than   the   sole   authority.   Those   initiating   food   mapping   projects,   then,      48  

   should   start   to   think   of   themselves   as   mediators   of   food   knowledge;   how   they   use   that   knowledge,  and  whom  they  engage,  is  entirely  dependent  on  the  project  and  goals  at  hand.

We  are  entering  a  new  era  in  mapping;  one  in  which  engagement  is  the  norm  rather   than  the  exception.  Learning  through  engagement  has  an  `expansive  effect'  on  the  broader   food   movement   (Levkoe,   2006).   It   can   have   a   substantial   impact   on   how   we   share   and   shape   ideas   through   already   engaged,   albeit   diverse   and   hyper-local,   food   system   stakeholders.   The   foundation   for   a   viable   and   desirable   food   future   requires   an   understanding   of   food   places,   encouraging   collective   impact   among   all   food   system   stakeholders,   and   preserving   the   unique   situation   of   each   locale.   Based   on   the   examples   presented   in   this   paper,   food   mapping   projects   builds   engagement   at   all   levels,   from   visualization   and   analysis   to   collaboration,   interaction,   and   participation.   These   maps   provide   linkages   across   scales,   sectors,   and   jurisdictions,   which   further   highlights   the   transformative   potential   of   realigning   the   inherently   spatial   attributes   of   human-food   interaction.   Collectively,   food   maps   provide   unparalleled   detail   about   the   built   environment,  food  resources,  and  the  communities  that  are  operating  within.     Learning  from  the  legacy  of  decades  of  food  mapping  while  capitalizing  on  evolving   mapping   technologies,   the   potential   exists   to   develop   more   collaborative,   interactive,   and   participatory  mapping  techniques.  These  techniques  can,  as  demonstrated  by  the  examples   highlighted   here,   foster   flows   and   linkages   between   and   within   all   levels   of   local   food   stakeholders.  In  fact,  many  diverse  and  hyper-local  food  places  are  still  not  recognized  in   federal,   provincial,   or   regional   food   assessments.   Food   mapping   can   facilitate   greater   awareness   of   the   places   that   comprise   a   robust   and   resilient   food   system;   all   while   engaging   the   communities   who   are   vested   in   a   food   secure   future.   Through   stakeholder   engagement  in  food  mapping,  we  are  building  a  new  narrative  for  local  food  systems  that  is   community-driven,  socially  motivated,  and  cumulating  a  shared  future.

4.  METHODS:  BUILDING  THE  DURHAM  FOOD  MAP  USING     VOLUNTEERED  GEOGRAPHIC  INFORMATION  SYSTEMS  

   Abstract   The   methods   developed   in   this   chapter   establish   the   process   of   creating   a   VGI   system   to   support  the  participatory  mapping  of  Durham's  local  food  assets.  

  

4.1  Building  a  VGI  System  using  Active  and  Participatory  Methods  
In   the   research   context   of   applying   volunteered   geographic   information   (VGI)   systems  to  explore  what  participatory  food  mapping  can  add  to  the  regional  food  system,   the  methods  outlined  here  establish  the  project,  participants,  Geoweb,  and  VGI  components   required  to  create  an  environment  that  supports  the  creation  of  VGI.  The  functions  further   structure   the   mechanisms   necessary   to   input,   manage,   analyze,   and   present   the   VGI.   In   addition  to  the  primary  VGI  data  collection,  field  notes  were  collected  before,  during,  and   after   VGI   system   development.   The   contextual   observations   gathered   via   field   notes   are   meant  to  be  complementary  evidence  (Kearns,  2005;  Resch,  2013)  to  the  more  controlled   and  formalized  VGI  system  data  collection.   The  methods  established  by  the  VGI  systems  framework  were  shaped  by  both  active   participant   observation   (APO)   and   participatory   geographic   information   systems   (PGIS)   approaches.  APO  is  a  subset  of  participatory  action  research.  While  participant  observation   was   one   of   the   earliest   qualitative   research   methods   used   to   studying   human   actors   (Johnson,   Avenarius,   &   Weatherford,   2006;   Schwartz   &   Schwartz,   1955;   Seymour,   2001),   it   has  been  more  recently  adapted  to  studying  participants  in  graphical  online  environments   (Williams,  2007).  This  type  of  action  research  shifts  away  from  hypothesis  testing  toward   experiential   and   exploratory   learning,   requiring   the   researcher   to   achieve   an   insider   perspective  to  enact  the  greatest  change  (Kearns,  2005;  Neumann,  Dixon,  &  Ekman,  2012).      50  

   This   type   of   active   observation   is   further   complemented   by   a   participatory   GIS   approach.   Facilitating   advancement   in   the   applications,   use,   and   distribution   of   community   driven  GIS,  PGIS  helped  set  the  foundation  for  both  participatory  Geoweb  and  VGI  research   (Elwood,   2008,   2009a).   Participatory   GIS   are   "context-   and   issue-driven   rather   than   technology-led   and   seek   to   emphasize   community   involvement   in   the   production   and/or   use  of  geographical  information"  (Dunn,  2007,  p.  616).  While  there  are  still  ongoing  issues   to   realizing   the   participatory   transformation   of   GIS,   participatory   GIS   did   help   the   technology   break   away   from   the   almost   exclusive   government   and   institutional   use,   and   facilitated  a  significant  increase  in  community  involvement  (Sieber,  2006).   By   combining   APO   and   PGIS   principles,   the   design   of   the   VGI   system   prioritized   active  participation  of  both  the  researcher  (APO)  and  the  local  food  community  (PGIS).  The   implementation   of   this   research   project   is   further   structured   upon   procedural   evidence   from  both  completed  and  ongoing  VGI  projects,  established  in  the  VGI  systems  framework   (Fast   &   Rinner,   2014).   The   system   (summarized   in   Table   4.1)   was   designed   to   collect   active   VGI,   where   the   participants   knowingly   contribute.   This   is   different   than   passive   VGI,   where   the   contributors,   for   example,   stream   data   from   a   location-enabled   device   and   are   often  unaware  of  project  goals  (Haklay,  2013a).  While  the  system  is  presented  in  sequential   order,  it  did  not  progress  linearly,  with  many  components  and  functions  coevolving.

   4.2.1  Project:  Durham  Food  System   Fundamental  to  the  development  of  a  VGI  system  is  the  underlying  project  and  its   purpose.   This   case   study   focused   on   the   food   system   in   Durham   Region,   a   regional   municipality   consisting   of   eight   lower-tier   municipalities   that   contain   a   mix   of   rural   and   urban   lands,   and   a   population   of   approximately   650,000   people.   Demographically,   the   population  is  concentrated  in  the  south  along  Lake  Ontario,  with  the  large  majority  of  the   population   living   in   urban   areas.   Durham   has   a   strong   agricultural   base,   which   is   threatened  by  the  irrevocable  loss  of  farmland  with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  acres  going   out  of  production  between  1991  and  2001  (Walton,  2003).  The  threat  continues  with  the   majority   of   proposed   and   approved   growth   in   the   region   occurring   on   prime   agriculture   land.   Compounding   this   loss,   much   of   the   region's   prime   agricultural   land   is   producing   nursery   stock,   animal   feed,   and   food   for   export,   rather   than   food   for   local   consumption   (Contreras-Judge  et  al.,  2013;  Kubursi,  Cummings,  MacRae,  &  Kanaroglou,  2015).   In   response   to   these   and   other   threats   to   Durham's   long-term   food   security,   the   political   climate   in   the   Province   of   Ontario   and   Durham   Region   prioritizes   local   and   sustainable  food  production.  In  addition  to  the  provincially  legislated  Local  Food  Act,  which   aims   to   promote   local   food   production,   increase   awareness   of   local   food   sources,   and   encourage   the   development   of   new   local   food   initiatives   (Bill   36,   2013),   the   region   is   responding  to  the  heightening  need  to  foster  a  sustainable  local  food  economy.  Prompted   by   the   Durham   Region   Roundtable   on   Climate   Change,   Regional   Council   endorsed   the   Durham  Region  Food  Charter  in  2009,  and  the  principles  therein  are  now  reflected  in  the   region's   Official   Plan.   The   Charter   reflects   the   "vision   for   a   food   secure   community,   focused   toward  building  a  just  and  sustainable  local  food  system  as  a  foundation  for  population  and   environmental   health"   (Contreras-Judge   et   al.,   2013,   p.   4).   This   Regional   Charter   also   encourages  municipalities  to  put  local  food  provisions  into  their  local  policies  and  plans.   Following  the  endorsement  of  The  Durham  Region  Food  Charter,  the  Durham  Food   Policy  Council  (DFPC)  was  formed  in  2010  to  oversee  its  implementation.  As  part  of  their   mandate,  the  DFPC  commissioned  the  Durham  Food  System  Environmental  Scan  (DFSES)   to  learn  about  the  various  food  initiatives  happening  in  the  region  (Contreras-Judge  et  al.,   2013).   The   scan   took   an   assets   approach,   which   tends   to   build   community   development,      53  

   rather  than  a  needs  approach,  which  tends  to  lead  to  community  dependence  (Kretzmann   &  McKnight,  1993).  The  assets,  categorized  by  food  processing,  distribution,  procurement,   recycling  and  waste,  and  consumption,  were  evaluated  according  to  their  interaction  with   the   biological,   economic,   political,   and   social   dimensions   of   the   food   system   (Contreras- Judge   et   al.,   2013).   The   DFPC   is   using   the   report   to   ensure   that   food   policy   accurately   reflects,   supports,   and   builds   mutually   beneficial   relationships   between   the   identified   assets.   The   scan   provided   key   insights   into   Durham's   food   system.   However,   a   major   limitation  identified  in  the  report,  and  confirmed  upon  consultation  with  the  DFPC,  is  the   underrepresentation   of   the   many   local   initiatives   that   comprise   Durham's   regional   food   system.  Given  there  were  no  reporting  mechanisms  to  capture  the  diverse  and  hyper-local   food  places,  the  scan  missed  what  DFPC  members  describe  as  essential  assets  to  the  food   system,  as  noted  in  the  limitations  section  of  the  report:   "This   report   provides   an   overview   of   the   existing   food   system   environment   in   Durham  Region,  allowing  for  a  high  level  scan  of  what  is  currently  going  on  locally.  A   detailed  analysis  of  the  food  system  fell  outside  of  the  scope  and  scale  of  this  project.   However,   the   DFPC   believes   that   such   an   analysis   is   important   and,   with   appropriate   partnerships   and   resourcing,   should   be   considered   as   an   important   next  step  in  this  work.     Further,  in  completing  this  report,  the  DFPC  noted  several  gaps  in  the  available  data.   For   example,   a   full   analysis   of   food   deserts,   obesity   and   diabetes   clusters   was   not   included   as   the   data   required   to   do   this   was   not   available   to   our   team   within   the   timeframe  of  this  project.  Therefore,  we  do  recommend  that  some  analysis  in  these   areas  continue  as  new  sources  of  data  come  available."       ­  Contreras-Judge  et  al.,  2013,  p.  6   The   gap   in   existing   data,   coupled   with   the   need   to   learn   more   about   local   food   assets,  shaped  this  project,  which  focused  on  creating  the  Durham  Food  Map,  which  a  map- based   resource   where   local   food   stakeholders   can   actively   contribute   geographic   information  with  the  purpose  of  adding  to  the  knowledge  of  food  assets  in  the  region.

   4.2.2  Participants:  Durham  Local  Map  Actors   Rooted  in  the  project  outlined  above,  the  next  step  in  setting  up  the  VGI  system  is  to   coordinate   the   efforts   of   a   large   number   of   actors   in   this   project   and   devise   strategies   to   encourage  the  participation  of  local  food  stakeholders.   4.2.2.1  Actors   Three  main  groups,  which  are  not  mutually  exclusive,  were  defined  as  the  initiator,   intermediary,   and   stakeholders.   First,   this   project   is   initiated   as   an   academic   research   study   to   apply   the   VGI   systems   framework   to   participatory   food   mapping.   True   to   the   active   participant   observation   method   (Jensen   &   Glasmeier,   2010;   Kearns,   2005),   the   socially  situated  researcher  becomes  actively  involved  in  Durham's  food  system.  Next,  the   intermediary   facilitated   the   participation   of   the   stakeholders   and   the   connection   to   project   initiators.   While   it   is   not   always   the   case,   in   this   study   the   academic   research   team   was   the   initiator  and  intermediary.   Lastly,   the   stakeholders   refer   to   participants   selectively   targeted   because   of   their   current   and   active   involvement   in   the   local   food   system,   acting   essentially   as   informants.   Since   motivation   to   participate   is   a   key   issue   in   VGI   research   (Elwood,   2008b;   Goodchild,   2008)  with  contributors  needing  to  understand  `why'  their  contribution  matters  (Coleman   et  al.,  2009;  Edwards,  2014;  Elwood  &  Leszczynski,  2013),  the  study  targeted  engaged  food   stakeholders   through   a   purposeful   promotional   strategy   consisting   of   preliminary   meetings,   emails,   and   presentations   (explored   in   the   next   section),   rather   than   broadly   targeting  all  citizens  using  a  extensive  social  media  strategy.  The  purposeful  sample,  typical   of   exploratory   research,   has   been   shown   to   generate   meaningful   results   (Newman   et   al.,   2010),  which  can  help  move  the  local  food  system  in  new  directions.   4.2.2.2  Promotional  Strategy   Preliminary  meetings  were  used  to  gain  access  and  manage  field  relations  (Kearns,   2005)   with   the   local   food   community   in   Durham.   Contact   was   first   established   with   the   region's  climate  change  coordinator,  who  then  facilitated  contact  with  the  Durham  Region   Roundtable  on  Climate  Change,  a  committee  of  regional  councillors  and  citizen  members.  A      55  

   presentation   to   the   Roundtable   resulted   in   a   list   of   key   food   stakeholders   in   the   region,   including   the   coordinator   for   the   Durham   Food   Policy   Council   (DFPC).   Immediately,   the   DFPC  took  a  strong  interest  in  the  project  because  of  the  previously  identified  limitations  of   the   DFSES,   and   the   organization's   overall   mandate   to   foster   greater   communication   among   the  various  food  system  stakeholders  in  Durham  Region.   Beyond  the  relationship  building  that  occurred  with  the  DFPC,  other  meetings  and   presentations   were   arranged   to   identify   other   stakeholders   in   the   region,   and   to   get   stakeholders   familiar   with   the   goals   of   the   participatory   mapping   project.   In   total,   seven   meetings   occurred   during   the   year   leading   up   to   the   deployment   of   the   Durham   Food   Map,   providing  valuable  information  about  the  state  of  the  current  food  system.   In   addition   to   the   seven   meetings,   preliminary   presentations   were   given   to   stakeholder  groups  outside  of  Durham  Region,  including  the  Toronto  Food  Policy  Council,   Clean  Air  Council,  and  Environmental  Advisory  Committees  of  Ontario.  In  doing  so,  it  was   decided   the   project   be   limited   to   the   Durham   Region,   serving   as   a   pilot   before   future   expansion  into  provincial-level  local  food  mapping.   Throughout   the   process   of  building   a   relationship   between   the   researcher   and   the   local  food  community,  30  key  food  stakeholders  were  identified  in  Durham  Region  and  its   eight   lower-tier   municipalities:   one   joint   government   and   citizen   group,   four   regional   government   agencies,   eight   municipal   government   agencies,   six   non-governmental   agencies,   six   community   groups,   and   two   post   secondary   institutions.   (See   Appendix   4A   for   a   complete   list   of   stakeholder   groups,   and   a   summary   of   the   promotional   strategy   employed   for   each.)   The   government   agencies   represented   the   environmental,   climate   change,   and   sustainability   sectors,   leaving   out   public   health   departments.   Healthy   food   systems   are   crucial   for   a   healthy   population   and   as   such,   health   department   would   be   a   valuable   addition   that   was   not   included   in   this   study.   In   future,   gaining   a   better   understanding  of  food  systems  from  both  an  environmental  and  health  point  of  view  would   further  strengthen  a  food  systems  study.  Community  groups  are  broadly  defined  as  being   comprised   by   all   volunteer   work   (i.e.,   no   paid   employees),   compared   to   NGOs,   which   are   more  formalized  organizations  that  have  paid  employee(s)  and  a  board  of  directors.

   To   facilitate   participation,   a   member   of   each   stakeholder   group   was   contacted   via   email   (see   Appendix   4B   for   email   text).   The   primary   contact   at   each   organization   was   often   the   climate   change   or   environmental   coordinator.   Further,   where   time   and   scheduling   permitted,   a   brief   presentation   was   given   to   the   organization,   incorporated   in   the  organization's  existing  meeting  schedule,  such  as  a  monthly  or  annual  meeting.  When   time   or   scheduling   did   not   permit   for   a   presentation,   a   three-minute   video,   uploaded   to   YouTube  (see   Appendix  4C  for  link  and  video  script),  was  used  to  explain  the  project  and   efficiently   support   the   understanding   of   `why'   participation   was   important.   Initially,   a   webinar   was   planned   for   all   groups,   but   given   the   time   commitment   required   by   participants  (typically  one  hour  at  a  set  time),  an  email  and  video  combination  was  deemed   a  more  flexible  option.  Once  the  participants  were  aware  of  the  project,  their  contribution   was  requested  via  the  Geoweb  infrastructure.   4.2.3  Geoweb  Infrastructure:  Crowdmap   Each   VGI   system   has   a   specific   set   of   hardware,   software,   and   Web   mapping   infrastructure   supporting   the   collection   of   volunteered   content,   herein   referred   to   as   the   Geoweb.   Among   the   many   free   pre-packaged   Geoweb   applications   available,   the   Durham   Food   Map   used   the   participatory   mapping   platform   Crowdmap   to   support   the   system.   Crowdmap  is  the  hosted  version  (i.e.,  does  not  require  installation  on  a  local  server)  of  the   Ushahidi  platform,  which  was  initially  designed  to  gather  reports  from  citizens  in  times  of   crisis  (Okolloh,  2009).     Crowdmap  offers  many  customization  options,  including  options  for  base  map  data   (OpenStreetMap   chosen),   RSS   feeds   (all   stakeholder   websites   added   if   they   have   RSS   enabled),   website   appearance   (title,   tags,   and   about   pages),  and   various   contribution   input   types  (reports,  email).  While  the  reports  can  be  contributed  by  anyone,  the  default  setting   in   Crowdmap   required   all   contributions   to   be   approved   before   becoming   visible   on   the   map.   For   this   study,   OpenStreetMap   mapnik,   an   open   source   toolkit   for   rendering   maps,   was   chosen   as   the   base   map   because   of   its   high   level   of   detail.   The   standard   and   customizable   options   available   through   the   Crowdmap   platform,   further   discussed   in   Section  4.2.2,  shape  the  functional  considerations  for  the  Durham  Food  Map.      57  

   4.2.4  VGI:  Local  Food  Assets  Data  Collection   The   project,   participants,   and   Geoweb   construct   an   environment   conducive   to   the   creation   of   VGI.   However,   before   VGI   can   be   created   by   the   identified   food   stakeholders,   seed   contents   have   been   shown   to   encourage   contributions   (Sani   &   Rinner,   2011).   Seed   contents  are  relevant  data  added  to  the  map  before  seeking  other  contributions,  in  order  to   encourage  participant  contribution.   Resulting  from  the  preliminary  meetings,  a  preliminary  dataset  was  acquired  from   the  Durham  Food  System  Environmental  Scan  (Contreras-Judge  et  al.,  2013)--generously   provided   by   the   Durham   Food   Policy   Council   and   Community   Development   Council   of   Durham--in  order  to  seed  contents  to  the  map.  While  these  data  were  not  technically  in  the   public  realm,  the  partnership  with  the  DFPC  enabled  access  to  the  otherwise  inaccessible   dataset.  To  mitigate  any  potential  risk  related  to  sharing  the  dataset,  it  was  provided  under   the   context   of   free,   prior,   and   informed   consent   (Williams   &   Hardison,   2013);   the   DFPC   consented,  prior  to  sharing  the  data,  to  make  the  dataset  available  to  the  public  for  viewing   and  downloading  within  the  Durham  Food  Map  environment.  This  sizable  dataset  ensured   future  contributors  are  not  looking  at  a  blank  map,  wondering  what  they  should  contribute.   The   content   of   the   dataset   represented   what   the   DFPC   already   knew   about   food   assets   in   the   region;   the   categories   within   consisted   of   community   gardens,   community   shared  agriculture  farms,  farmers'  markets,  food  banks,  and  supermarkets.  The  dataset  also   included  latitude,  longitude,  name  of  asset,  city,  and  description  attributes.  These  data  were   used   as   a   baseline   to   measure   additional   volunteered   contributions.   Five   additional   classifications   were   added   based   on   asset   categories   stakeholders   identified   during   the   preliminary   meetings:   foodscapes   (landscape   with   food),   neighbourhood   gardens,   proposed   gardens,   events,   and   `other'   for   contributions   not   represented   by   existing   categories.  The  creation  of  the  intended  VGI  is  further  explicated  by  considering  the  system   functions  for  the  Durham  Food  Map.  

4.3  Functions  
Building   on   the   components   of   the   system,   the   functional   considerations   shape   the   input,   management,  analysis,  and  presentation  of  VGI.      58  

   4.3.1  Input   The   input   focused   on   who   contributed   the   data.   Geographic   information   was   traditionally  inputted  by  professionals  but  crowdsourcing  relies  more  broadly  on  citizens   to   input   data.   In   preparation   for   VGI   collection   in   this   project,   students   inputted   seed   content  during  a  datathon,  which  is  a  variation  of  the  more  popular  civic  data  hackathon;   contest-based   events   that   turn   government   open   data   into   innovative   applications   that   help  deliver  services  to  citizens  (Johnson  &  Robinson,  2014).  The  datathon,  in  contrast  to   data   hackathons,   only   requires   data   input,   rather   than   focusing   on   using   the   data   for   application  development.   During   the   datathon,   held   February   4th   2015,   six   undergraduate   and   masters   students  volunteered  to  input  the  seed  content.  In  addition  to  the  data  provided  from  the   DFSES,   students   added   a   mandatory   description   to   the   report--a   requirement   of   the   Crowdmap   platform--using   information   found   on   the   web.   Website   links   are   added,   if   available.   The   student   datathon   also   served   as   a   test   run   of   the   Crowdmap   application,   proving  its  capacity  to  handle  multiple  reports  simultaneously.   Once   the   seed   content   was   added   and   the   mapping   platform   performance   tested,   Crowdmap  was  ready  for  the  direct  input  by  local  food  stakeholders.  A  dedicated  Durham   Food  Map  email  address  was  created  for  those  wanting  to  ask  questions,  or  submit  addition   report   information.   The   SMS   input   option   (phone-based   text   messaging),   available   through   Crowdmap,   was   not   enabled   for   this   project   because   detailed   contributions   were   sought.   Ultimately,   this   decision   limited   contributions   from   those   who   do   not   have   web-enabled   phones   or   desktop   computers.   The   lead   researcher   monitored   contributions   daily   and   tracked   Web   activity   using   Google   Analytics   to   determine   contribution   and   participation   rates.   4.3.2  Management   Various   administrative   considerations   have   been   identified   for   the   effective   management   of   VGI   projects,   including   the   composition   of   the   organizational   team,   contribution  vetting,  data  storage  and  download,  and  project  timeframes.

   In  larger  projects,  teams  are  often  developed  to  achieve  the  various  tasks  required.   Since   this   was   a   smaller   research-based   project,   the   lead   researcher   managed   the   project   and  was  exclusively  responsible  for  all  Crowdmap  administration.  However,  a  higher  level   of  oversight  is  a  necessary  part  of  project  management.  As  such,  the  DFPC  was  invited  to   oversee  the  project,  acting  as  an  advisory  committee.  The  advisory  committee  and  project   initiator   collectively   set   the   scope   for   the   desired   VGI,   including   the   contribution   vetting   process.   Various   authors   suggest   that   all   contributions   should   be   welcome   (Coleman,   Sabone,   &   Nkhwanana,   2010;   Hickling   Arthurs   Low,   2012).   After   consultation   with   literature   and   the   advisory   committee,   we   decided   that   all   contributions   be   approved   unless  proven  incorrect  or  defamatory  information.   Once   the   Durham   Food   Map   was   ready   for   volunteered   contributions,   the   30   stakeholder   groups   were   contacted   to   contribute   to   the   map.   While   only   those   from   the   identified  stakeholder  groups  were  contacted,  rather  than  employing  a  broad  social  media   strategy,   contributions   were   not   restricted   to   this   group   only.   Contributions   from   individuals  outside  of  these  groups  were  to  be  included  on  the  map,  again  unless  incorrect   or   defamatory.   The   `about   this   project'   page   of   the   map   included   consent   information,   which   stated   that   participants   consent   to   participate   by   adding   contributions   to   the   map.   If   they  chose  not  to  consent,  they  are  requested  not  to  add  content  to  the  map.   Primary   storage   was   in   the   cloud   through   the   Crowdmap   platform,   with   periodic   backups  of  the  data  stored  on  a  local  computer.  The  Crowdmap  environment  offers  a  public   data   download   option,   which   was   activated   to   support   the   creation   a   food   asset   dataset   that   is   accessible,   usable,   downloadable,   and   archivable.   According   to   Sieber   &   Johnson's   (2015)  classification  of  civic  open  data,  the  open  dataset  generated  through  this  project  fits   into   the   participatory   open   data   category.   It   represents   a   first   attempt   of   data   co- production  between  authoritative  and  citizen-generated  data  in  the  regional  food  system,   where   stakeholder   contributions   are   integrated   and   synthesized   in   the   authoritative   dataset   provided   by   the   DFPC.   Overall,   the   co-production   of   data   by   multiple   food   stakeholders  and  open  access  improves  the  quality  and  utility  of  the  data  generated.   Timeframe  was  the  final  management  consideration.  While  many  notable  examples   of   VGI   systems   are   ongoing   projects,   including   OSM   and   Wikimapia,   staff   and   financial      60  

   resources   limit   the   operating   time   of   a   project.   A   constrained   timeframe   can   help   ensure   the  sustainable  operation  of  a  project.  While  there  is  no  agreed  upon  timeframe  for  a  study   such   as   this,   Haklay   (2014)   identified   six   to   eight   weeks   as   the   ideal   timeframe   of   a   problem-oriented  project,  with  a  minimum  lead  time  of  three  months.  Neis  &  Zipf  (2012)   also   observed   that   the   majority   of   OSM   contributions   occurred   within   three   months   of   registration,  before  sharply  declining.  As  such,  the  lead  time  for  this  project  was  one  year,   and  the  contribution  timeframe  was  three  months  between  February  and  April  2015.   4.3.2  Analysis  of  VGI   The   analysis   focused   exclusively   on   the   type   of   contributions   generated,   as   contributor   and   contribution   statistics   are   reported   as   part   of   the   input   results.   There   is   currently   limited   capacity   to   analyze   VGI   datasets   because   it   is   not   from   a   representative   sample  of  the  population.  Given  the  challenges  to  measuring  validity,  objectivity,  or  other   quantitative   impacts   of   VGI,   some   have   tried   to   measure   usability   of   the   mapping   environment  (G.  Newman  et  al.,  2010;  Nivala,  Brewster,  &  Sarjakoski,  2008).     The   study   took   a   different   approach   by   undertaking   a   thematic   analysis   of   the   participant  contributions  received  from  the  Durham  Food  Map,  categorized  by  the  typology   of   user-generated   content   established   by   Rinner   &   Fast   (2015).   Locations,   categories,   numeric,   description,   media,   and   opinion   types   classify   the   typologies.   The   analysis   supported  the  categorization  and  interpretation  of  user  contributions  to  the  Durham  Food   Map,   which   enabled   the   subsequent   organization   and   compilation   of   a   centralized   food   assets  dataset.   4.3.4  Presentation     Effectively  synthesizing  and  presenting  the  food  assets  dataset  ultimately  supports   the   ongoing   spatial   understanding   of   the   food   environment   in   Durham.   After   compiling   the   data   in   a   centralized   dataset,   an   open   dataset   will   be   made   available   to   the   public.   This   dataset  can  then  support  a  permanent  Web  map  resource.  A  Web  map  ensures  longer-term   sustainability   beyond   the   research   project   timeframe.   The   DFPC   expressed   interested   in   supporting   the   Durham   Food   Map   after   the   active   data   collect   phase,   but   requested   to   revisit  the  topic  once  the  pilot  project  wrapped  up.      61  

   The   outcomes   of   this   study   also   need   to   be   summarized   in   a   way   that   is   easily   comprehended  and  communicated  with  the  DFPC  and  other  food  system  stakeholders.  As   such,  a  report  summarizing  findings  of  the  study  is  an  important  resource  to  supplement   the  Web  map.  This  report  is  intended  to  build  on  the  assets  identified  in  the  existing  Food   System  Scan,  with  a  particular  focus  on  what  was  learned  about  the  regional  food  system   through   participant   contributions.   As   discussed   with   the   DFPC   in   preliminary   meetings,   this   report   is   viewed   as   a   project   deliverable   and   as   such,   was   requested   to   be   made   publicly  available  on  the  DFPC's  website.  

4.4  Conclusion  
It  is  under  the  conditions  presented  in  this  chapter  that  the  VGI  system  on  Durham's   food   assets   is   established.   The   next   step   of   this   research   is   to   understand   the   outcomes   associated  with  following  this  process.

   Appendix  4B:  Email  to  Local  Food  Stakeholders  
Dear <insert contact>, As you know from your work with <insert association>, there are many great local food assets in Durham Region, including community gardens, school greenhouses, local food procurement, harvest trading tables, foodscapes, gardening workshops, and more! To learn more about these food assets, the Durham Food Policy Council partnered with Ryerson University to develop the Durham Food Map. Please see our short 3-minute video about the Durham Food Map: https://youtu.be/UOg5GZLP__w Building on the Durham Food System Environmental Scan, there are already many food assets on the map. However, there are many more to add, especially from municipalities in Northern Durham. If you have initiated, participated in, or know about food assets in the Region, you can help in 1 of 3 ways: 1. Please go to https://durhamfood.crowdmap.com and check to see if your food asset is on the map, and if all of the information is correct. If you would like to add anything (photos, links, news stories, updated information), leave a comment on the report or send an email to durhamfoodmap@yahoo.ca and it will be added to the map. Please upvote it if it's correct, too. 2. If your initiative isn't already on the map, please add it by clicking "Create Report". You can report the title, location, description, websites, photos, and more. 3. If you know of anyone working toward strengthening food assets in Durham Region, please forward this email to them. The more contributions we get on the Durham Food Map the better! The map will be open for contributions until April 30th, 2015. After this date, the contributions will be incorporated into a report for the Durham Food Policy Council. Sharing information about your food events, community initiatives, and other food assets helps shape future food policies and planning in Durham Region. In particular, this map resource will be used by the Durham Food Policy Council in support of the Durham Food Charter, in addition to building an online community of local food advocates. Please reply to this email DurhamFoodMap@yahoo.ca if you have any questions, comments, or general inquiries. Also, send an email if you would like to share information about your food asset without adding it to the map. Thank you for helping us crowdsource Durham's food secure future! Sincerely, Victoria ...on behalf of the Durham Food Map. Victoria Fast PhD Candidate, Ryerson University, Environmental Applied Science and Management

Title:  Durham  Food  Story(Map)    Link:  https://youtu.be/UOg5GZLP__w   1. 2. 3. 4. Hi,  I'm  Victoria  Fast  and  I'm  going  to  share  Durham's  Food  Story...  using  the  Geoweb   Maps  are  increasingly  online  and  interactive.  If  you  use  Google  Maps,  you've  used  the  Geoweb.   This  Google  map,  in  particular,  shows  the  Durham  Region,  which  is  just  east  of  Toronto.     Local  Food  system  stakeholders  in  Durham  are  already  using  the  Geoweb  to  share  spatial   information,  including:     5. The  Durham  Farm  Fresh  map  of  farm  locations;  and,   6. Durham  Integrated  Growers  map  of  community  gardens.     7. Our  research  partner,  the  Neptis  Foundation,  developed  a  specialized  Geoweb  designed  to   visualize  how  regional  and  municipal  plans  connect--or  more  accurately,  do  not  connect--with   each  other,  helping  us  tell  a  STORY  about  growth  in  Durham.   8. Focusing  on  southern  Durham,  purple  shows  current  built  up  areas.     9. Next,  we  add  surrounding  protected  areas  (green)  and  prime  agricultural  land  (yellow).   Here's  where  the  story  gets  interesting.  Let's  add  urban  expansion.   10.   The  2  shades  of  pink  show  where  the  Region  plans  to  grow...   11. ...which  is  concentrated  over  prime  agricultural  land.   12. The  story  we're  starting  to  tell...   13. ...Is  that  we're  prioritizing  growth  over  food  security.   14. But  these  maps  only  tell  part  of  the  food  story;  the  part  that's  in  official  planning  documents.     15. Traditional  ways  of  mapping  don't  show  the  diverse  and  hyper-local  places  of  food  that  are  also   contributing  to  Durham's  food  story.   16. In  fact,  there  are  thousands  of  people  tweeting  about  local  food.  What  are  they  saying?   17. They're  talking  about:  the  Tuesday  Trading  Table,  where  inner  city  residents  traded  surplus   produce  with  other  gardeners.     By  the  end  of  the  season,  food  was  so  plentiful  it  was  given  away  to  those  in  need.   18. They're  talking  about:  the  Neighbourhood  garden  started  on  a  vacant  downtown  property  by   the  We  Grow  Food  community  group.   19. The  garden  supplied  30  families  with  over  "25"  hundred  pounds  of  food.   20. And  a  place  for  neighbours  to  meet.   21. They're  talking  about:  Beautiful  food  planted  alongside  flowers,  which  was  harvested  and   donated  to  the  local  food  bank.   22. Building  sustainable  and  regenerative  local  food  systems  require  bringing  these  diverse  food   initiatives  together.   23. This  research  is  dedicated  to  giving  citizens  a  platform  to  share  their  food  stories.     Think  Google  maps  meets  Wikipedia.  We're  crowdsourcing  food  resources.   24. The  custom  build  Geoweb  allows  anyone  with  an  Internet  connection  to  report  locations,   photos,  links,  and  videos  of  food  resources,  initiatives,  and  events.     25. It  enables  local  food  stakeholders--including  individuals,  community  groups,  non-profits,  and   government--to  share  their  successes  &  add  to  Durham's  food  story.     26. Overall,  this  research  highlights  citizen-led  initiatives,  ultimately  supporting  community  driven   food  policies.   27. Maps  can  tell  a  story.  Participatory  mapping  can  change  a  story!     28. And  there's  so  much  to  add  to  this  story.  Please  visit:  durhamfood.crowdmap.com  to  learn   more.   29. Thank  you  to  our  funders,  partners,  and  you  for  watching.

5.  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION:  REPORTING  FOOD  ASSETS  IN  DURHAM  REGION  

   Abstract   Applying  the  VGI  systems  framework,  the  results  in  this  chapter  report  on  the  process  of   implementing  a  VGI  system  framework  to  support  the  participatory  mapping  of  Durham's   local   food   assets,   organized   by   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation   functions.   The   discussion   elaborates   on   the   engagement   of   the   various   stakeholder   groups   and   the   pivotal  role  of  the  intermediary.  Overall,  this  project  served  as  a  test  implementation  of  the   VGI   system   framework,   while   contributing   new   information   about   food   assets   in   Durham's   regional  food  system.  

  

5.1  Input  
This   study   began   with   no   publicly   available   data   on   Durham's   regional   or   local   food   system,   other   than   disconnected   pieces   of   spatial   data   online,   such   as   the   locations   of   community   gardens   maintained   by   Durham   Integrated   Growers   and   farms   that   hold   Durham   Farm   Fresh   memberships.   The   study   focused   exclusively   on   data   that   were   actively   volunteered   by   the   identified   stakeholders   (i.e.,   contributions),   rather   than   passively  collected  from  various  online  sources.   In  total,  volunteers  contributed  227  data  points  (Table   5.1),  54  of  which  were  not   used  (contribution  vetting  explored  in  Section  5.2.2).  The  first  contribution  was  the  dataset   gathered   and   used   in   the   Durham   Food   System   Environmental   Scan   (DFSES),   which   was   previously  inaccessible  and  stored  privately.  The  dataset  contained  130  data  points,  22  of   which   were   not   used.   Beyond   this   initial   dataset,   contributions   were   divided   into   three   input   types:   individual   contributions   added   directly   to   the   map   (12),   individual   contributions   emailed   and   added   by   the   intermediary   (8),   and   dataset   contributions   (3   datasets,  77  total  data  points).  Based  on  a  tally  of  those  who  contributed  via  email  and  an      66  

   estimate   of   online   contributors,   approximately   23   unique   participants   contributed   these   data.   The   three   most   significant   findings   are   the   mode   of   input,   access   rates,   and   contribution  of  entire  datasets.                           Table  5.1:  Summary  of  volunteered  contributions,  contributions   vetted,  and  primary  mode  of  input   SOURCE Dataset from DFSES Individual contributions added directly to map Individual contributions emailed and added by intermediary Contribution of entire dataset (3 total) Total: # OF POINTS 130 12 8 77 227 CONTRIBUTIONS

5.1.1  Email   Only  12  of  the  227  data  points  were  added  directly  to  the  map.  The  remaining  215   data  points  were  contributed  via  email,  including  eight  individual  contributions  as  well  as   the   remaining   dataset   contributions.   Both   individual   contributions   and   dataset   contributions  sent  via  email  relied  heavily  on  the  intermediary  to  input  the  contributions  to   the  map.  However,  the  eight  individual  contributions  that  were  emailed  contained  the  most   detailed   information   about   food   system   assets,   and   included   information   on   inspiration,   status,  and  connections  to  other  food  stakeholders  (further  analyzed  in  Section  5.3).     Coleman,   Sabone,   &   Nkhwanana   (2010)   suggest   that   participation   rates   could   be   related  to  program  effectiveness  (i.e.,  user  friendliness  of  the  map  application),  however  a   mechanism   to   test   Crowdmap   effectiveness   was   not   part   of   this   study.   While   it   was   not   possible  to  confirm  why  email  input  is  preferred,  this  finding  highlighted  the  need  for  the   intermediary   to   take   an   active   role   in   project   management   and,   among   other   responsibilities,  mediate  the  map  contributions.

   5.1.2  Access  Rates   In   comparison   to   the   low   rate   of   active   contributions,   the   number   of   people   viewing   the   site   was   high,   according   to   the   sessions   recorded   by   Google   Analytics   (Figure   5.1).   Google   Analytics   recorded   1011   sessions   from   893   users   during   the   three-month   timeframe,   indicating   that   88%   of   the   sessions   were   by   new   users   (these   statistics   also   included   researcher   activity).   Interestingly,   sessions   peaked   immediately   following   two   mass   email   events.   The   initial   email,   sent   after   receiving   approval   from   the   DFPC   on   March   15th,   2015,   generated   134   new   sessions.   The   email   sent   April   26th,   2015,   reminding   participants   that   the   data   collection   would   close   April   30th,   2015,   generated   the   highest   peak  of  197  sessions  (see  Appendix  5A  for  detailed  Google  Analytics  reporting).  

  

Figure  5.1:  Sessions  recorded  via  Google  Analytics  from  February  to  May  2015   The   23   active   contributors   out   of   893   unique   users   led   to   a   participation   rate   of   approximately  2.5%.  As  reported  by  Neis  &  Zielstra  (2014),  OpenStreetMap  demonstrates   similarly  skewed  participation  rates,  with  only  20,000  of  the  1.3  million  registered  users,  or   approximately  1.5%,  actively  contributing  VGI  in  2013.  Further,  within  the  group  of  active   contributors,   there   are   significant   differences   in   the   level   of   activity,   with   the   majority   of   contributors  only  being  active  for  three  months  after  registration  (Neis  &  Zipf,  2012).  Given   the  three-month  timeframe  of  this  project,  the  2.5%  participation  rate  was  likely  the  peak   of   participation.   The   February   to   April   timeframe   proved   adequate,   although   multiple   contributions  were  received  (and  accepted)  during  the  month  of  May.   5.1.3  Volunteered  Datasets   In  addition  to  the  initial  dataset  contributed  by  the  DFPC,  three  stakeholder  groups   opted   to   share   dataset   contributions   rather   than   individual   contributions.   The   groups,      68  

   representing  two  NGOs  and  one  community  group,  previously  held  the  datasets  privately   but   expressed   an   interest   to   increase   accessibility   of   their   information   through   the   mapping   interface.   Overall,   the   datasets--containing   information   on   farms,   farmers'   markets,  and  community  gardens--were  more  detailed  (i.e.,  containing  attributes  such  as   contact   information,   operating   hours,   and   produce   available),   up-to-date   (i.e.,   two   of   the   three   datasets   updated   in   2015),   and   complete   (i.e.,   containing   all   of   the   farms   and   community   gardens   operating   in   2015)   than   the   information   initially   contributed   by   the   DFPC.   In   order   to   integrate   these   datasets   into   the   Durham   Food   Map,   the   datasets   were   manually  cleaned  of  duplicate  records,  keeping  the  most  up-to-date  contributions,  and  then   uploaded  to  the  Durham  Food  Map.   Interestingly,   volunteered   dataset   contributions   are   not   typically   associated   with   VGI,  nor  do  they  qualify  as  open  data,  which  is  typically  gathered  from  government  sources,   because   of   the   authority   and   availability   of   the   data.   Rather,   the   volunteering   of   entire   datasets  created  and  maintained  by  NGOs  and  community  groups  occupies  an  unexplored   area  somewhere  between  the  two.  While  there  are  challenges  to  realizing  the  value  of  these   datasets--including   establishing   data   standards,   mechanisms   for   sharing,   and   intermediary   facilitation--the   NGOs   and   community   groups   who   were   part   of   this   study   demonstrated  a  willingness  to  share  their  fastidiously  maintained  datasets  for  the  benefit   of   the   broader   food   system.   The   contributions   from   these   non-government   groups,   when   effectively  combined  and  presented,  is  a  source  of  current  and  relevant  data  that  was  not   previously  integrated  into  regional  decision-making.  

5.2  Management  
The   prominent   aspects   of   the   management   of   VGI   systems   relates   to   the   organizational  context,  contributor  vetting  process,  and  data  download  considerations.   5.2.1  Organizational  Context   The   project   employed   a   small   research   team.   Since   the   researcher   group   represented   both   the   initiator   and   intermediary,   communication   was   not   an   issue.   The   advisory   committee,   introduced   in   section   4.3.2,   also   worked   well   as   part   of   the   organizational   team.   They   were   given   agency   to   define   various   elements   in   the      69  

   participatory   mapping   process,   including   which   stakeholders   to   contact,   information   to   include   in   the   email,   and   contributions   to   vet.   In   some   instances,   the   decision-making   agency  shared  with  the  advisory  group  led  to  delays  in  project  deployment.  However,  the   delays   were   eclipsed   by   the   value   of   the   DFPC's   advocacy   for   the   mapping   project,   facilitating  support  from  other  local  food  stakeholders.   5.2.2  Contributor  Vetting   In   total,   54   of   the   227   contributions   received   were   not   included   on   the   map.   This   high  vetting  rate  was  attributed  to  different  reasons  than  initially  expected.  Originally,  the   advisory   committee   discussed   removing   contributions   that   were   incorrect   or   inappropriate.   In   practice,   most   contributions   that   did   not   make   it   to   the   map   contained   either  sensitive  or  inadequate  spatial  information.   The   vast   majority   of   vetting   occurred   because   it   contained   sensitive   spatial   information.  For  example,  in  the  initial  DFSES  dataset,  the  food  banks  category  contained   45   entries.   However,   22   of   the   45   data   points   were   not   included   because   they   contained   information   related   to   shelters   and   support   services,   which   is   information   not   currently   publically   available   (i.e.,   emergency   women's   shelters).   The   other   23   data   points   related   to   food   banks   were   added   to   the   map   because   this   information   is   available   online   through   disparate   websites.   Also,   contributions   that   contain   food   assets   reported   at   private   residences  were  withheld  to  protect  individual  privacy.  Lastly,  related  to  privacy,  tensions   arose  between  government  and  citizens  regarding  bylaws  regulating  locations  where  food   can  and  cannot  be  grown.  Given  the  ongoing  nature  of  this  issue,  names  and  affiliations  of   the  contributors  are  removed  from  the  data.   Contributions   were   also   excluded   if   they   lacked   adequate   location   information.   All   12   contributions   added   directly   to   the   map   were   included,   because   the   pre-set   input   options  within  the  mapping  application  required  contributors  to  include  adequate  spatial   information.  In  contrast,  only  four  of  the  eight  contributions  inputted  via  email  made  it  to   the   map   because   they   did   not   contain   adequate   spatial   information.   In   the   following   example   sent   via   email,   the   contributor   shared   information   on   a   food   asset   in   the   region,   but  the  contribution  was  missing  adequate  spatial  information  to  add  it  to  the  map:      70  

   "The  Big  6:  DDSB  Cafeterias  are  sourcing  local  carrots,  cooking  onions,  mushrooms,   red  peppers,  apples,  and  cucumbers  for  this  entire  school  year."     It   was   impossible   to   know   which   six   schools   within   the   Durham   District   School   Board   this   contribution   refers   to.   While   this   type   of   contribution   cannot   be   added   to   the   map   because   of   the   ambiguity   of   the   spatial   information,   local   food   procurement   initiatives   are  valuable  information  about  food  assets  in  the  region.   The   next   example,   also   sent   by   email,   did   not   include   explicit   location   information   and   focused   on   a   range   of   food   strategies,   rather   than   food   assets.   This   highlights   the   difference   between   assets   that   are   typically   location-based,   compared   to   strategies   that   broadly   operationalize   food   policies.   The   latter   does   not   lend   itself   to   mapping   because   strategies  do  not  relate  to  a  feature  on  the  earth's  surface.   "Aside   from   our   Farmers'   Market   and   healthy   diet   initiatives   (part   of   our   Health   Workplace   Program),   we   don't   have   any   other   food   strategies   in   place   yet.   The   development   of   programs   to   encourage   local   food   procurement   and   community   involvement  is  included  as  a  strategy  in  Phase  1  of  our  5-year  strategic  plan,  which   was  just  approved  at  the  Senior  Leadership  Level.  If  we  can  find  a  way  to  align  the   strategy  with  our  academic  programs  then  it  may  accelerate  implementation."   5.2.3  Data  Download   The   data   download   option,   unfortunately,   excluded   the   photo,   video,   or   Web   links   that  many  contributors  provided.  This  is  considered  a  major  limitation  of  Crowdmap's  data   download   function   because   the   photos   and   links   enrich   the   reporting   of   food   assets.   As   a   result,   the   lead   researcher   manually   gathered   these   data   from   email   contributions   and   known  food  system  stakeholder  so  they  can  be  included  in  the  final  report.   In   addition,   the   individual   contributions   reported   directly   to   Crowdmap   contained   optional   fields   for   first   name,   last   name,   and   email   address   of   the   contributor,   in   which   approximately   half   of   those   who   reported   chose   to   include   their   personal   information.   These  data  are  included  (i.e.,  cannot  be  excluded)  in  the  public  data  download  function  in   Crowdmap.   As   a   result,   the   data   download   function   had   to   be   disabled   part   way   through   the  project  to  protect  the  privacy  of  individual  contributors.  As  an  alternative,  other  open   data  repositories  were  investigated  and  CartoDB  was  chosen  (explored  in  Section  5.4).

5.3  Analysis  
The   analysis   supported   the   categorization   of   data   attributes   according   to   the   typology   of   user   contribution,   which   includes   location,   categorical   and   numeric   data,   descriptions,   media,   and   opinions   (Table   5.2).   The   typology   was   applied   to   all   contributions  gathered  in  this  study,  which  included  the  individual  contributions  (IC)  and   the   dataset   contributions   collected   from   the   Durham   Food   System   Environmental   Scan   (DFSES),   Durham   Farm   Fresh   (DFF),   We   Grow   Food   (WGF),   and   the   Durham   Integrated   Growers   (DIG).   The   analysis   of   the   attributes   supported   the   integration   of   these   diverse   datasets  in  a  common  database  to  be  subsequently  repurposed  for  further  use.   Table  5.2:  Typology  of  volunteered  contributions  to  the   Durham  Food  Map   SECTION DATA TYPES # of data points: 5.3.1 Locations 5.3.2 Categorical 5.3.3 Numeric 5.3.4 Description 5.3.5 Media 5.3.6 Opinions 5.3.1  Locations   The   location   represents   the   spatial   dimension   of   the   data.   All   of   the   data   contains   explicit  or  implicit  location  information,  which  is  a  necessary  requirement  for  the  data  to   be   mapped.   The   explicit   location   data,   expressed   in   latitude   and   longitude   coordinates,   is   used   less   frequently   than   the   implicit   content   of   addresses   or   features   (e.g.,   road   intersection).  Crowdmap  was  able  to  handle  implicit  location  information  in  the  form  of  a   postal   address,   but   other   implicit   location   data   required   manual   interpretation   by   the   intermediary   in   order   to   input   the   data   to   the   map.   For   example,   the   primary   location   information   of   one   contribution   was   `NW   corner   of   Port   Perry   fairgrounds',   which   the   map   platform   is   unable   to   recognize.   The   project   intermediary   identified   the   location   using   satellite  imagery  and  then  manually  inputted  it  as  a  point  on  the  map.   IC 20      DFSES 130    DFF 42    WGF 23    DIG 13

   Spatial  data  can  be  represented  using  point,  line,  or  polygon  (area)  feature  classes.   While  the  map  was  able  to  handle  all  three  classes,  points  were  used  most  often.  Only  three   of  the  contributions  were  polygons,  despite  community  gardens,  farmers'  markets,  farms,   and   other   food   assets   covering   larger   geographic   areas   that   are   better   represented   using   polygons.  As  such,  no  analysis  on  size  of  assets  could  be  performed  on  these  data.   5.3.2  Categorical  Observations   The   initial   dataset   from   the   DFSES   contained   five   categories,   with   four   other   categories   added   based   on   early   meetings   with   food   stakeholders   (5.3).   The   `other'   category   also   gained   insightful   contributions,   which   are   collectively   referred   to   as   innovative  food  assets.   Table  5.3:  Categorical  contributions   FOOD  SYSTEM   ENVIRONMENTAL  SCAN   Farms   Farmers'  markets   Community  gardens   Supermarkets   Food  banks   CONSULTATION  WITH   STAKEHOLDERS   Foodscapes   Neighbourhood  gardens   Proposed  community  gardens   Events   Other  (Innovative  Food  Assets)  

Farms,   the   most   abundant   contribution   on   the   map,   are   concentrated   in   the   rural   locations   throughout   the   region.   The   data   on   farms   was   initially   available   in   the   DFSES,   however   the   contribution   by   DFF   contained   more   detailed   and   up-to-date   information.   Farmers'  markets   are  distributed  throughout  the  region,  with  each  municipality  having  as   least   one   market.   These   data   came   from   DFSES   and   DFF,   again   with   DFF   providing   more   complete  and  current  data  that  subsequently  replaced  the  data  from  the  DFSES.  There  are   dozens  of  community  gardens   in  the  dataset,  which  were  added  through  a  combination  of   DFSES,  DIG,  and  individual  garden  coordinators'  contributions.     Supermarkets   and   food   banks   were   contributed   exclusively   by   the   DFSES,   not   receiving   any   contributions   from   stakeholders.   Both   categories   are   underrepresented   in   the  dataset,  with  many  key  retailers  and  services  missing.  Smaller  supermarkets,  specialty   stores   (e.g.,   bakeries),   prepared   food   (e.g.,   fast   food   and   other   restaurants),   and   corner      73  

   stores   are   not   represented   by   the   supermarkets   category.   Similarly,   certain   food   bank   services  were  repressed  in  the  dataset  to  protect  privacy.  These  data  would  be  necessary   for  detailed  analyses  of  food  access  and  food  deserts.   The  above  contributions--farms,  markets,  gardens,  supermarkets,  and  food  banks-- represent  knowledge  that  the  DFPC  already  had,  with  the  contributions  from  DFF,  DIG,  and   select   individual   contributions   supporting   the   update   of   the   dataset.   In   contrast,   the   following   individual   contributions--foodscapes,   neighbourhood   gardens,   trading   tables,   seed   libraries,   and   other   innovative   food   assets--represent   assets   not   addressed   in   the   DFSES.   Foodscapes,   which   is   understood   as   landscaping   with   food-based   plant   material,   demonstrates   the   functional   and   beautiful   aspects   of   food   production.   Stakeholders   were   keen   to   share   their   experiences   of   planting   food   outside   of   traditional   vegetable   gardens,   which   included   incorporating   food   in   planters,   front   gardens,   boulevards,   and   City   and   Regional  flowerbeds.  Most  of  the  experiences  were  positive:   "Oshawa  has  been  planting  food  alongside  flowers,  creating  beautiful  foodscapes."     "Kale  planted  in  the  botanical  gardens  in  Valleyview  gardens,  downtown  Oshawa."  
  

However,   one   contributor   reported   (off   the   map)   bylaw   conflicts   when   they   planted   vegetables  on  the  boulevard  in  front  of  their  property.  Unfortunately,  this  contribution  was   not   added   to   the   map   because   it   contains   sensitive   location   and   personal   information.   While   not   mappable,   it   brought   forth   an   interesting   conflict   between   Regional   and   City   policies  that  support  urban  food  production  and  bylaws  that  prohibit  food  production  for   public  safety  or  aesthetic  concerns.  Both  government  and  citizens  are  promoting  producing   food  locally,  so  this  ongoing  issue  requires  continued  attention  in  order  to  come  up  with  a   resolution  that  meets  the  needs  of  all  parties  involved.  This  issue  is  addressed  in  detail  in   the  project  report  (presented  in  Section  5.4.2).   Three   neighbourhood   gardens   were   added   to   the   map.   These   gardens   are   distinguished   from   community   gardens.   In   traditional   community   gardens,   residents   pay   and  manage  an  allotment.  Neighbourhood  gardens,  also  referred  to  as  communal  gardens,   are   established   as   a   common   resource   for   the   immediate   neighbourhood,   and   local      74  

   residents   are   expected   to   take   no   more   than   they   can   eat   in   one   day.   The   three   neighbourhood   gardens   reported   on   the   map--Carol's   Neighbourhood   Garden,   Pepper   Patch   Garden,   and   Cordova   Street   Garden--are   community   initiatives   where   the   City   approved   the   use   of   public   or   parklands,   volunteers   donated   plants   and   time,   and   neighbours   maintain   their   new   communal   resource.   These   gardens   are   celebrated   (and   awarded)   for   building   strong   communities   in   what   is   defined   as   Oshawa's   most   underprivileged  neighbourhoods.  The  `proposed  community  gardens'  category  was  added   initially   because   there   were   new   gardens   in   the   planning   phase.   However,   once   the   map   was   ready   for   stakeholder   input,   the   proposed   gardens   were   reported   as   neighbourhood   gardens.  As  such,  all  neighbourhood  gardens  are  grouped  together  in  the  final  dataset.   The   events   category   was   added   to   the   map   because   various   stakeholders   identified   multiple   food-related   events   happening   in   the   region   (e.g.,   seed   swaps,   gardening   workshops,   and   food   events),   but   a   common   resource   to   share   that   information   does   not   currently  exist.  While  a  few  events  were  added  to  the  map,  it  was  not  ideal  because  there   was   no   specific   location,   date,   or   time   fields   to   include   information   related   to   the   event.   Recognizing  this  as  a  limitation  of  the  map,  the  We  Grow  Food  community  group  created  an   events   calendar,   available   on   their   website,   to   supplement   the   Durham   Food   Map.   The   calendar  is  currently  being  updated  semi-regularly  to  keep  residents  informed  about  food   events  happening  in  the  region.   The   other  category  received  unique  contributions,  which  are  labeled  as  innovative   food   assets.   These   assets   include   harvest   trading   tables,   seed   libraries,   greenhouses,   and   pollinator  gardens.  The  Tuesday  trading  table  is  an  initiative  started  by  a  local  restaurant   in  Oshawa:   "Local  gardeners  are  getting  together  to  swap  vegetables  every  Tuesday  outside  of   the  Table  restaurant  on  Simcoe  Street  in  Oshawa.  No  cash  allowed...  only  trading   vegetables  and  other  edibles/seeds."   The  Oshawa  Public  Library  started  the  seed  library:   "The  library  is  helping  your  garden  grow  this  year!  Have  a  look  for  the  Need  a  Seed,   Leave  a  Seed  display  at  any  branch  and  you  may  find  just  the  seeds  you  need  for   planting  this  spring.      75  

   The  Oshawa  Public  Libraries,  in  support  of  agricultural  sharing  and  preservation,   will  be  hosting  a  Need  a  Seed,  Leave  a  Seed  display  at  all  branches  beginning  this   April,  and  running  until  the  end  of  June.   If  you  have  extra  seeds  at  home,  you  can  share  them  with  fellow  community   members  by  leaving  them  with  the  display.  Simply  ensure  they  are  in  a  sealed  and   labelled  envelope.   This  is  a  great  way  to  try  growing  something  new,  or  to  share  seeds  of  your  own   with  others.   Together,  we  can  take  this  step  towards  preserving  and  promoting  community   sustainability  and  beauty!   Take  part  in  our  Need  a  Seed,  Leave  a  Seed  program,  and  get  growing!"   The  local  community  identified  public  greenhouses  as  a  need,  rather  than  an  asset.   Multiple   members   of   the   community   indicated   they   need   access   to   a   place   to   start   their   seedlings  in  the  winter  and  early  spring.  Only  one  greenhouse,  which  does  not  have  public   access,  was  reported  on  the  map:     "Henry  Street  High  School  has  a  greenhouse  and  a  garden  that  is  brand  new  this   year  (2015).  They  are  working  on  various  initiatives  related  to  connecting  the   garden  with  the  hospitality  program/cafeteria."   Lastly,  pollinator  gardens  were  reported  as  an  important  food  asset:   "The   Town   of   Ajax,   along   with   the   TRCA,   is   about   to   install   a   pollinator   garden   on   the   berm   located   on   the   south-east   corner   of   the   [St.   Andrew's]   park.  There   are   plans  to  install  bee  habitats  and  a  bat  box  in  that  same  location.  As  well,  the  Town   will  be  installing  a  small  public  orchard,  located  just  north  of  the  garden  plots,  which   includes  apple  and  pear  trees."     "We   are   in   the   process   of   working   with   a   volunteer   group   who   have   received   a   donation   of   pollinator   plants.  They   are   working   with   the   Legends   Community   Garden  to  undertake  a  planting  at  the  garden."   5.3.3  Numeric  Measurements   Collecting   volunteered   contributions   in   the   form   of   numeric   measurements   was   not   the   goal   of   this   study.   However,   multiple   contributions   were   received   that   contained   attribute   information   related   to   the   number   of   plots   within   community.   These   data   were   included   in   the   description   because   the   map   environment   was   unable   to   individually   handle  numeric  measurements.        76  

   In  addition,  one  dataset  contained  the  names  of  gardens,  their  addresses,  size,  and   number  of  pounds  of  food  grown  in  2014.  The  dataset  collectively  reported  on  23  private   gardens   that   covered   11,500   square   feet   and   grew   an   estimated   20,500   pounds   of   fresh   produce.   This   is   valuable   information,   as   there   are   few   studies   on   urban   food   production   capacity,   however   the   personal   and   location   information   in   the   dataset   was   deemed   too   detailed   to   release   to   the   public.   It   is   important   to   note   that   government   and   decision- makers  are  looking  for  quantified  benefits  to  justify  further  support  of  urban  food,  so  we   will  be  able  to  repurpose  these  data  for  other  uses  in  the  future.   5.3.4  Descriptions   The   descriptions,   many   of   which   have   already   been   shared   in   this   paper,   are   the   most   substantial   contributions.   The   descriptions   include   annotations,   narratives,   stories,   and  other  details  about  the  food  asset  being  reported.  Many  food  stakeholders  wanted  to   share   the   story   of   their   particular   food   asset,   including   details   on   the   origin,   motivation,   current  status,  and  future  development  potential.  The  community  garden  category  contains   the   most   detailed   descriptions,   as   demonstrated   by   contributions   from   the   Care   and   Share,   Hebron,  Whitby-Ajax,  and  Salvation  Army  Community  Gardens.   Care  and  Share  Community  Garden:     "Inspiration   for   Starting   It:     A   few   of   us   attended   "The   Place   to   Bee:     A   Pollination   Event"   -   at   Lunar   Rhythms   CSA   (just   outside   of   Blackstock   -   I   think   the   address   is   Janetville,   so   they   are   officially   within   the   City   of   Kawartha   Lakes   region).  A   specialist   had   come   to   talk   about   her   work   in   encouraging   farmers   to   plant   pollinators   along   ditches,   between   crops,   etc.  After   attending   this   event,   I   volunteered   at   Happy   Farm   and   started   to   learn   about   sustainable   farming   practices.  And  learned  so  much.  At  the  same  time,  I  read  a  book  called,  "The  Stop".     By  late  August  2013,  fearing  that  our  local  fairgrounds  would  be  re-developed  into   housing   in   the   near   future,   I   approached   the   Port   Perry   Agricultural   Society,   who   hold  the  lease  for  this  land  (from  the  Township  of  Scugog).  I  was  granted  permission   to   start   a   project   on   a   small   parcel   of   land   (1/3   of   an   acre)   on   the   Northwest   corner   of  the  grounds.   SO,   LONG   STORY   SHORT   -   OUR   GROWING   KNOWLEDGE   OF   FOOD   SECURITY   AND   FOOD   JUSTICE,   ALONG   WITH   CONCERNS   ABOUT   THE   PHYSICAL   AND   MENTAL

   At  the  end  of  2012  the  Whitby  Ajax  Garden  Project  entered  a  new  chapter  in  its  life   becoming  an  independent  not-for-  profit  organization  working  toward  registration   as  a  charity.     As  we  move  forward  we  are  reminded  that  WAGP  is  so  much  more  than  a  garden.  It   gives   us   the   opportunity   to   be   truer   stewards   of   the   earth.   Looking   out   over   the   garden   we   are   filled   with   a   sense   of   hope   in   the   future   and   the   presence   of   something  and  someone  much  greater  than  ourselves."   Salvation  Army  Garden   "The  Salvation  Army's  Community  Garden  currently  has  19  plots.  Each  Garden  Plot   is   5   x   15.   All   Garden   soil,   seeds   and   plants   are   provided   to   get   you   started.   Access   to   Garden   is   Combination   Lock   Entry.   Garden   tools   are   provided   on   site.   We   are   currently   looking   for   anyone   interested   in   acquiring   a   plot   within   our   Garden   community.  If  you  have  any  questions  or  you  would  like  to  visit  the  Garden  please   feel  free  to  contact  the  Community  Garden  Coordinator."  
  

While  many  contributors  shared  illuminating  descriptions,  not  everyone  shared  this   level  of  detail  in  writing.  For  example,  the  description  for  the  Tuesday  Trading  Table  and   neighbourhood  garden  contained  only  a  few  short  sentences.  Instead,  these  groups  opted   to   share   their   story--history,   motivation,   challenges,   opportunities,   and   more--in   person   during  meetings,  presentations,  and  other  contact  time  with  the  researcher.  These  details   are   captured   using   the   supplemental   field   notes,   and   the   report   to   the   DFPC   allows   the   opportunity  to  share  the  details  of  both  the  written  and  oral  descriptions  of  assets.   5.3.5  Media   Media   is   a   type   of   volunteered   contribution   gaining   particular   importance.   Almost   all  of  the  data  acquired  contained  links  to  websites,  email  addresses  of  the  primary  contact,   and  social  media  links,  like  Facebook  and  Twitter.  While  none  of  the  dataset  contributions   contained   photos,   many   individual   contributions   contained   photos.   However,   the   photo   upload  function  only  worked  selectively,  so  many  who  intended  to  share  photos  either  did   not   upload   them   or   submitted   them   via   email.   Adding   further   restrictions   on   the   media   typology,   photos   were   not   available   in   the   data   download   function.   To   supplement   the   limited  photos,  some  photos  were  taken  of  reported  assets  by  the  researcher  to  include  in   the  final  report.      79  

   5.3.6  Opinions   Opinions,   including   ratings   and   comments,   were   not   regularly   used   in   this   study,   despite   the   option   to   do   so.   Up   voting   and   down   voting   a   report   (i.e.,   thumbs   up,   thumbs   down)   and   comment   functions   were   made   available   but   not   used   by   participants.   There   was  also  a  verify  function,  but  it  was  used  inconsistently,  which  led  to  arbitrary  distinctions   between   contributions   that   were   and   were   not   verified.   As   a   result,   none   of   the   contributions  were  verified.     While   the   comment,   voting,   and   verify   functions   were   underutilized   in   the   Crowdmap   platform,   other   opinion-type   contributions   were   received   off   the   map.   There   was  one  comment  on  the  YouTube  video,  which  identified  multiple  assets  and  suggestions   for  action  in  the  community:   "Did  you  know  there  is  a  seed  exchange  initiative  at  the  Oshawa  Downtown   Library?  Or,  perhaps  you  are  part  of  this.  The  work  you  are  doing  is  great,  and  much   needed.     There  is  a  real  issue  of  food  security  with  many  South  Oshawa  residents  on   disability.  The  food  banks  do  the  best  they  can;  but  often,  fresh  produce  is  difficult  to   come  by.  Is  there  anyone  connecting  the  Oshawa  food  banks  to  D.I.G  and  the  "We   grow  Food"  movement?   Additionally,  someone  needs  to  liaise  with  the  Oshawa/Durham  based  ODSP  case   workers.  Is  it  possible  to  get  an  insert  in  the  statements  that  go  out  each  month,  to   let  recipients  know  about  their  local  community  garden  project,  where  they  can   participate/connect?   Another  liaison  point:  Canadian  Mental  Health  Association  -  Durham.   Thank  you  for  the  work  you  are  doing."   ­  Local  resident,  YouTube  comment   Another  opinion,  sent  via  email,  identified  an  incorrect  location  of  a  garden  on  the  map:     "the   location   on   the   map   for   is   a   little   off...instead   of   being   situated   on   Rideout,   as   shown  on  the  map,  our  garden's  main  entrance  is  located  off  the  parking  lot  on  the   west   side   of   the   park   (pretty   well   where   the   lower   'P'   is).   The   garden   itself   takes   up   the  space  formerly  occupied  by  what  is  shown  to  be  a  baseball  diamond  in  the  park."    
  

The   project   intermediary   corrected   the   location   manually   on   the   map.   Lastly,   one   contributor   emailed   to   explain   a   browser   compatibility   issue.   After   investigation,   it   was      80  

   determined   that   the   browser   issue   was   isolated   to   this   user's   computer,   so   no   further   action   was   taken.   Since   these   opinion-type   contributions   were   resolved,   they   are   not   included  in  the  final  food  assets  dataset.

Synthesizing  the  above  typology,  prominent  types,  fields,  and  subfields  emerge  from   the   contributions   that   are   relevant   to   all   data   gathered   in   this   study   (Table   5.4;   also   see   Appendix   5B   for   a   detailed   breakdown   of   attributes   from   each   contributor   group   and   a   link   to   the   open   dataset).   This   dataset   is   used   to   support   the   creation   of   the   Food   Assets   in   Durham  Region  map  and  the  Crowdsourcing  Urban  Food  Assets  report.   Table  5.4:  Types,  fields,  and  subfields  in  Durham's  food  asset  dataset     TYPE   Location   Category   Description   Media   Metadata      In   particular,   the   final   dataset   includes   location,   category,   description,   media,   and   metadata   types.   The   numeric   and   opinion   types   were   not   used   enough   to   justify   their   inclusion,  and  thus,  not  included  in  the  dataset.  Links  and  social  media  are  included  as  field   in   the   media   feature   class,   but   photos   are   not   included   because   of   issues   with   uploading   photos  into  the  reports  and  downloading  photos  from  the  dataset.   Lastly,  a  metadata  feature  class  was  added  to  the  dataset.  Metadata,  defined  as  data   about   data,   include   details   related   to   who   created   the   data,   when   the   data   were   created,   and  other  data  quality  information,  which  helps  to  assess  its  fitness  for  use  (Devillers  et  al.,   2010).  While  there  have  been  improvements  in  spatial  data  quality  over  the  last  30  years,   there  are  very  little,  if  any,  metadata  associated  with  most  volunteered  datasets.  Coleman      81   FIELD  NAME   Geometry     Address   Asset   Name   Details   Links   Contact   information   Timestamp   Origin   SUBFIELDS   Latitude/longitude   Postal  Address   Farm,  Farmers'  Market,  Community  Garden,  Food   Bank,  Supermarket,  Foodscape,  Innovative  Food  Asset   Business/feature  name   Short  description   Website,  Twitter,  Facebook   Name,  email   Date  data  created   IC,  DFSES,  DFF,  WGF,  DIG  

   (2010)   noted  that  the  lack   of   metadata   in   volunteered   datasets--in   particular,   information   on  sources  of  data  and  subsequent  edits  of  OpenStreetMap  data--makes  it  challenging  to   identify  why  some  data  may  be  more  accurate  than  others.   To  maintain  the  quality  of  the  food  assets  dataset,  which  was  acquired  from  multiple   sources   (individual   contributions,   DFSES,   DFF,   and   DIG)   with   data   created   at   different   times,  origin  and  timestamp  details  are  included  as  fields.  In  the  data  gathered  in  this  study,   less   than   half   contained   a   timestamp   (i.e.,   when   the   data   were   created).   In   contrast,   almost   all   of   the   data   could   be   attributed   to   the   source,   whether   an   individual   contribution   or   dataset   contribution.   However,   in   an   attempt   to   capture   the   origin   of   data   in   the   final   dataset   without   identifying   individual   contributors,   the   origin   field   is   generalized   to   the   dataset   it   came   from,   which   is   sub-categorized   as   IC,   DFSES,   DFF,   and   DIG.   On   a   similar   privacy   note,   if   an   individual   contributor   could   be   identified   from   their   affiliation,   the   affiliation  was  also  removed  from  the  examples  presented  in  this  research.   5.4.1  Food  Assets  in  Durham  Region  Map   Crowdmap   was   ideal   for   actively   collecting   VGI   within   the   scope   of   the   Durham   Food   Map   project   because   the   platform   is   designed   to   gather   reports   from   the   public.   However,   because   of   the   constant   and   continued   reliance   on   the   intermediary   to   support   the  system--promoting  the  project,  mediating  the  input,  and  approving  the  reports,  among   many   other   tasks--the   reporting   function   is   only   ideal   during   data   collection.   To   support   a   permanent  map  resource  using  the  data  generated  in  this  study,  a  new  mapping  platform  is   needed  that  requires  less  maintenance  while  still  offering  data  download  functions.     While   Geoweb   options   able   to   create   interactive   online   maps   are   constantly   expanding,  potential  mapping  applications  are  limited  to  free  online  mapping  tools  because   proprietary   GIS   software   is   expensive   and   open   source   options   have   steep   learning   curves.   Bartlett  &  Rivard  (2014)  compared  nine  free  online  mapping  tools,  including  GeoCommons,   MapBox,   and   CartoDB.   While   there   are   many   considerations   that   went   into   the   selection   of   an   online   mapping   tool,   CartoDB   was   chosen   because   the   software   is   free,   the   database   management   system   allows   for   easy   data   updates,   the   map   can   be   managed   by   multiple   users   and   is   easily   embedded   into   a   separate   website,   and   the   data   are   open   and      82  

   downloadable   in   multiple   formats.   The   downside   to   this   platform   is   the   limits   to   the   amount  of  data  that  can  be  entered;  only  four  individual  layers  totalling  no  more  than  50   megabytes  of  data  can  be  entered.  While  the  dataset  generated  in  this  study  is  within  these   limits,  it  potentially  restricts  future  expansion  to  provincial  or  national  level  food  mapping.   The  permanent  map--called  Food  Assets  in  Durham  Region  in  order  to  distinguish   it  from  the  Crowdmap-based  Durham  Food  Map--will  be  embedded  on  the  DFPC  website   once   their   new   website   goes   live.   In   the   meantime,   the   map   and   the   data   are   publically   available  on  CartoDB:  http://cdb.io/1LJjx18.  

   Figure  5.2:  Food  Assets  in  Durham  Region  map  created  using  CartoDB  and     data  volunteered  by  Durham's  food  community   5.4.2  Report   The  report,  intended  for  the  DFPC,  can  be  seen  as  an  extension  of  the  initial  Durham   Food   System   Environmental   Scan.   In   the   scan,   urban   food   assets   were   largely   underrepresented  in  favour  of  a  broader  food  industry  focus  (e.g.,  agricultural  production,      83  

   food  process,  distribution,  and  retail).  While  this  study  targeted  a  broad  spectrum  of  local   food   stakeholders,   representing   rural   and   urban   interests,   the   most   active   contributions   were   from   the   urban   food   community.   As   such,   the   report   resulting   from   this   study   (Appendix   5C)   focuses   on   urban   food   assets   that   are   central   to   the   food   communities   hosting  them.  The  food  stakeholders  engaged  in  this  study  have  clearly  demonstrated  that   urban   food   is   going   beyond   backyard   gardens,   pointing   to   new   trends   in   urban   food   production.   These   urban   assets   identified   by   the   community   add   to   an   emerging   field   of   studying  how  cities  can  become  more  food  secure,  given  the  shift  from  rural  to  urban  living.   The  report  is  supported  by  the  data  collected  from  the  food  stakeholders  in  Durham   Region.   However,   the   time   the   researcher   spent   with   the   food   community   led   to   a   detailed,   cross-sector   view   of   the   regional   food   system,   enriched   by   the   narratives   shared   during   stakeholder   meetings   and   presentations.   These   narratives   are   essential   to   understanding   the   context   around   many   of   the   regional   food   assets   reported.   As   such,   the   report   goes   beyond   the   content   of   the   contributions   and   draws   on   field   experience   (field   notes)   to   further  reflect  on  the  value  of  the  food  assets  identified  to  the  urban  food  system.  Further,   it   also   includes   recommendations   to   support,   strengthen,   and   encourage   growth   of   Durham's  urban  food  assets.

The   outcomes   of   the   research   are   an   up-to-date   food   assets   database   that   was   contributed   by   the   regional   food   community,   which   then   supported   the   creation   of   an   online  interactive  food  map  and  a  report  on  urban  food  assets.  In  addition  to  these  outcome   benefits  of  enacting  a  VGI  system,  there  were  also  process  benefits  that  are  challenging  to   objectively   measure   and   report.   This   research   aimed   to   engage   local   food   actors   in   the   fundamentally   social   participatory   mapping   process   by   getting   them   to   share   their   location-based   food   assets.   While   there   is   a   growing   understanding   of   the   societal   implications   of   this   new   social   practice   on   the   networked   publics   (N.   Chrisman,   2005;   Elwood  et  al.,  2012;  Elwood,  2009a;  Lin,  2013),  it  is  still  a  challenge  to  tangibly  measure  the   impact   the   Geoweb   and   VGI   have   on   networking,   advocacy,   and   collaboration   efforts   toward   building   a   food   community.   According   to   Schaffer   (2007,   p.   3),   "most   citizen   sites      84  

   don't  use  traditional  metrics  --  unique  visitors,  page  views  or  revenues  --  to  measure  their   success."   Rather,   success   is   more   often   determined   by   the   impact   the   site   has   on   the   community.   We  suspect  the  impact  of  this  research  and  engagement  far  surpassed  the  numbers   reported   above.   Beyond   the   stakeholders   engaged   and   data   created,   the   discussion   reflects   upon   the   engagement   among   the   stakeholder   groups   and   the   role   of   the   intermediary.   Overall,  the  bottom-up  (involvement  of  the  food  community)  and  top-down  (involvement   of   the   researcher)   design   of   this   project   enabled   the   limited   but   meaningful   engagement   of   participants.     5.5.1  Stakeholders   Durham   Region   encompasses   a   diverse   set   of   local   food   champions   that   represent   government,   NGOs,   community   groups,   and   individuals   working   tirelessly   to   support   a   secure   food   system,   30   of   which   were   identified   and   contacted   in   this   research.   These   stakeholders  represent  people  and  organizations  already  engaged  in  local  food  issues,  and   vested   in   the   various   outcomes   of   regional   and   local   food   decision-making.   Individually,   they   possess   fragments   of   valuable   information   about   the   local   food   system   in   Durham;   fragments  that,  put  together,  provide  a  dataset  to  better  understand  what  food  assets  are   important  to  the  regional  food  community.   Overall,   the   participants   volunteered   a   mix   of   datasets   and   individual   contributions,   supporting   learning   about   the   local   food   assets   within   the   region.   Particularly   active   engagement  came  from  the  NGO  and  community  group  participants,  compared  to  the  more   limited  engagement  of  government  stakeholders.  The  individuals  within  these  groups  were   more   inclined   to   actively   and   meaningfully   contribute   data,   both   individual   contributions   and   larger   datasets.   Many   noted   that   they   were   already   trying   to   work   toward   better   collaboration  (especially  online)  with  other  food  system  stakeholders,  so  the  map  provided   a   medium   to   support   their   pre-existing   goals.   The   lesson   here   is   to   harness   existing   food   champions,   targeting   those   already   engaged   as   an   entry   point   to   more   meaningful   reporting  and  dialogue.

   At   the   time   of   writing   of   this   thesis,   the   metropolis   of   Milan   in   Italy   released   their   first,   and   perhaps   one   of   the   world's   most   comprehensive   guides   on   supporting   a   sustainable   food   system   (Barilla   Centre   for   Food   and   Nutrition   Foundation,   2015).   The   strength   of   the   "Milan   Protocol   on   Food   and   Nutrition"   revolves   around   the   hundreds   of   signatories   who   have   committed   to   a   more   sustainable   food   system.   The   signatories   are   from   a   wide-range   of   food   system   stakeholders,   just   like   the   ones   targeted   in   this   research.   Their   collective   strength   and   action   is   what   can   make   a   difference   in   the   food   system.   Better   tools   and   resources   for   collaboration   are   essential,   and   participatory   mapping   proved  to  be  one  of  them.   5.5.2  Intermediary   The  engagement  of  the  stakeholder  groups  could  not  be  realized  without  the  active   contribution   of   an   intermediary.   The   researcher   facilitated   the   cross-sector   sharing   of   stories,   resources,   and   initiatives   throughout   the   preliminary   meetings,   formal   presentations,   video,   and   follow-up   contact.   In   this   project,   like   many   others   conducting   participatory  mapping,  crowdsourcing,  or  citizen  science,  the  mediation  was  central  to  the   deployment   of   the   VGI   system.   As   such,   it   is   important   to   further   refine   this   role,   and   its   effectiveness,   to   continue   developing   VGI   systems   to   connect   decision-makers   with   civil   society.   There  is  a  growing  need  for  intermediaries  who  can  bridge  the  gap  between  experts   in   the   subject   matter   (i.e.,   food   stakeholders)   and   experts   in   a   digitally   enabled   approach   (i.e.,  trained  mapmakers).  This  became  strikingly  obvious  in  this  project.  The  intermediary,   who  was  also  the  initiator,  established  the  technical  side  of  the  Durham  Food  Map.  The  map   functioning   properly   was   essential   for   participation.   The   role   of   the   intermediary   is   a   point   worth  further  exploration.   The   process   of   gaining   both   knowledge   and   trust   within   the   local   food   system   through   preliminary   meetings,   gathering   contributions,   and   following   up   with   the   stakeholders   enriched   the   researcher's   knowledge   and   involvement   in   the   local   food   system.   This   contact   and   subsequent   familiarity   of   the   domain   was   of   utmost   value   to   building   trust   among   the   existing   community,   highlighting   the   necessity   of   the   extensive      86  

   lead-time.  Further,  the  researcher  became  regarded  as  a  local  food  champion.  This  position   allowed  the  researcher  to  work  across  the  fragmented  local  food  groups  with  the  purpose   of  advocating  various  assets  across  the  region.  Thus,  resulting  from  the  active  engagement   of   the   initiator,   the   impact   of   this   project   extended   far   beyond   the   participatory   mapping   environment.  Results  like  these  would  not  be  expected  if  the  VGI  systems  framework  had   been  applied  to  a  project  aiming  at  collecting  passive  VGI,  highlighting  that  the  VGI  system   perspective   is   not   exclusively   about   the   mapping   technology;   it   is   equally   about   the   project   and  participants  it  supports  and  shapes.  

5.6  Limitations  
The   decisions   made   during   the   study   about   how   to   establish   the   VGI   system   represent  uncontrolled  variables;  it  is  impossible  to  determine  the  impact  that  choosing  a   different  variable  would  have  had  on  the  study's  outcome.  The  two  major  limiting  choices   that   likely   had   the   greatest   impact   on   this   study   are   related   to   targeting   active   food   system   stakeholders,   rather   than   conducting   a   broad   social   media   campaign,   and   selecting   the   Crowdmap  application  from  the  host  of  Web  map  options.   Targeting   engaged   food   stakeholders   led   to   few,   but   meaningful   contributions,   suggesting   that   it   was   an   effective   strategy   to   upgrade   the   information   known   about   assets   within   the   regional   food   system.   However,   it   was   not   representative,   nor   comprehensive.   The  relatively  small  number  of  participants  (n=23)  and  contributions  (n=227)  in  this  study   created   a   dataset   that   is   not   representative   of   all   food   assets   in   the   region.   This   limits   further  analysis  of  the  data  related  to  the  distribution  of  assets  throughout  the  region,  such   as   locating   food   deserts,   food   swaps,   or   healthy   food   communities.   In   addition,   limiting   the   scope  of  contributions  to  food  assets  potentially  excluded  those  who  do  not  identify  their   contribution   to   the   food   system   as   an   asset,   while   the   PAR   approach   potentially   over- emphasised   desirable   (i.e.,   positive)   response   as   no   negative   responses   were   received.   In   light   of   these   limitations,   the   contributions   gathered   from   this   small   group   of   informants   add  new  information  about  the  regional  food  system;  information  that  was  not  previously   accounted  for  in  provincial  or  regional  asset  mapping.    

  

87  

   The   limitations   imposed   by   the   Crowdmap   application   are,   similar   to   other   methodological   choices,   impossible   to   measure   because   there   are   no   control   variables.   The   challenges   related   to   uploading   photos   in   Crowdmap   discouraged   some   residents   from   sharing  their  photos.  While  some  chose  to  email  these  separately,  it  is  impossible  to  know   who  wanted  to  share  photos  but  did  not  end  up  doing  so.  Similarly,  the  reliance  on  email   for   individual   contributions   suggests   that   the   stakeholders   may   not   yet   be   comfortable   submitting   reports   directly   to   the   map.   Presumably,   larger   datasets   were   sent   via   email   because   it   would   be   too   time   consuming   to   upload   them   as   individual   contributions.   For   both  individual  and  dataset  contributions,  the  role  of  the  intermediary  is  necessary  for  the   development  of  a  participatory  VGI  system.  In  addition,  as  addressed  in  section  5.3.1,  the   majority  of  the  contributions  were  point  based  geographic  features,  with  no  lines  and  few   polygons   used   to   represent   various   features   of   food   assets.   This   oversimplifies   food   assets,   such  as  farms,  to  points,  thus  eliminating  elements  of  spatial  coverage.   Lastly,  this  participatory  mapping  project  in  Durham  Region  was  hoped  to  provide  a   foundation  for  provincial-  and  national-level  food  asset  mapping,  ultimately  supporting  the   widespread   information   sharing   necessary   for   building   more   resilient   food   systems   that   are   strongly   linked   to   the   assets   in   each   community.   However,   by   its   very   nature,   this   research  is  rooted  in  developing  a  relationship  with  the  local  food  community  in  order  to   connect   to   what   they   identify   as   assets   and   priorities   moving   forward.   It   would   be   challenging   to   develop   similar   multi-stakeholder   alliances   at   the   provincial-   or   national- level.   As   such,   scaling   up   participatory   food   mapping   would   require   connecting   to   the   organizations   and   institutions   (government,   NGO,   community,   and   academic)   currently   maintaining   datasets   on   the   regional,   provincial,   and   national   food   system.   If   they   are   willing   to   share   their   data,   like   the   food   stakeholders   who   maintain   data   on   Durham's   food   system  did  for  this  study,  it  would  be  a  strong  starting  point  for  the  expansion  of  local  food   mapping.    

5.7  Conclusion:  Synthesizing  the  Durham  Food  VGI  System  
This   study   focused   on   using   VGI   to   engage   multi-sector   food   system   stakeholders   to   create  new  information  on  regional  food  assets.  Structured  by  the  VGI  systems  approach,      88  

   and  under  the  conditions  of  the  methodology  developed  in  this  research,  new  knowledge   on   food   assets   was   generated.   This   knowledge   went   beyond   what   was   previously   available   to  regional  food  decision-makers  from  the  DFSES  or  OpenStreetMap.  The  new  knowledge   highlights   citizen-identified   assets,   suggesting   new   directions   to   strengthen   the   regional   food   system.   In   particular,   urban   food   assets   were   identified   as   a   priority   for   many   citizens   in  Durham  Region.   The   resources   created   from   this   study,   specifically   the   map   and   urban   food   assets   report,  have  the  potential  to  inform  future  regional  and  municipal  food  policy  and  planning.   It   is   now   up   to   the   regional   food   community   to   utilize   these   new   resources   to   develop   regional  food  policies,  programs,  and  regulations  that  support  these  community  identified   assets.   The   impact   of   this   policy-relevant   research   on   regional   and   municipal   food   policy,   and   program   and   regulation   development   that   come   with   it,   will   be   determined   through   the  continued  commitment  of  the  actors  engaged  in  this  research.  In  particular,  the  Durham   Food  Policy  Council  plays  a  central  role  in  using  these  resources  to  support  stronger  food   policy.   While   the   scope   of   this   study   ends   here,   the   primary   recommendation   moving   forward   is   to   mobilize   the   cross-sector   network   of   engaged   food   stakeholders   to   develop   regional  food  policies,  to  be  adopted  by  each  municipality,  that  support  strong  urban  food   systems.   Currently,   an   urban   food   policy   working   group,   comprised   of   government   and   citizen   members   under   the   mandate   of   the   DFPC,   is   being   formed   to   work   toward   realizing   this  recommendation.     Overall,   the   Durham   Food   Policy   Council   gained   a   uniquely   local   and   community- driven   perspective   about   food   system   assets   within   the   region   using   the   VGI   system.   Knowledge   of   community-identified   food   assets   is   a   central   element   of   a   regional   food   system  that  is  economically  viable,  ecologically  sound,  and  socially  just.

   Durham  Food  Map:  A  Primer   The   participatory   mapping   of   regional   food   assets,   dubbed   the   "Durham   Food   Map",   was  initiated  to  enable  knowledge  sharing,  promote  community  engagement,  and  support   policy-relevant  research  related  to  Durham's  regional  food  system.   The  Durham  Food  Map  responded  to  the  limitations  highlighted  in  the  Durham  Food   System  Environmental  Scan,  which  called  for  a  more  detailed  (local)  analysis  of  the  existing   food   environment   in   Durham   Region   (Contreras-Judge   et   al.,   2013).   The   scan   took   an   assets-based  approach,  exploring  the  strengths  of  the  regional  food  system.  However,  at  the   time   of   the   scan,   there   was   no   mechanism   for   the   local   food   community   to   share   what   they   identified  as  food  assets.   Given   that   the   local   food   community   is   central   to   the   regional   food   system,   this   project   developed   a   Web   map   platform   that   enabled   the   regional   food   community   to   share   food   assets   with   other   food   system   stakeholders,   regional   councils,   and   decision-makers.   As   a   part   of   this   study,   food   system   stakeholders   from   various   sectors   in   the   region-- including  government,  NGO,  and  community  groups--were  identified,  contacted,  and  asked   to  report  known  food  assets  in  an  online  mapping  environment.     Individually,   these   stakeholders   possess   fragments   of   valuable   information   about   urban  food  assets.  Collectively,  they  serve  as  a  mechanism  to  learn  more  about  community- identified   strengths   within   the   regional   food   system,   effectively   capturing   the   distributed   intelligence  of  those  who  are  active  in  Durham's  food  system.   This  study  is  built  on  the  concept  of  crowdsourcing,  where  information  is  obtained   by   enlisting   the   participation   of   the   public   (Brabham,   2009;   Lauriault   &   Mooney,   2014).   Crowdsourcing   map-based   information   is   more   specifically   known   as   volunteered   geographic   information   because   the   public,   in   this   case   food   system   stakeholders,   are   volunteering  information  about  food  assets  to  an  online  map.

   In  summary,  over  200  contributions  were  gathered  from  Durham's  food  community   and   added   to   the   Durham   Food   Map   (Figure   1).   These   contributions   represent   a   broad   spectrum   of   diverse   and   hyper-local   food   assets,   including   neighbourhood   gardens,   permaculture,  and  foodscapes.  In  addition,  the  Durham  Food  Mapsite  attracted  over  1000   unique   visitors   between   February   and   April   2015,   serving   as   a   valuable   resource   for   the   food  community,  even  if  many  viewers  did  not  actively  contribute.   While   this   study   targeted   a   broad   spectrum   of   local   food   stakeholders,   representing   rural   and   urban   interests,   the   most   active   contributions   came   from   the   urban   food   community.  This  is  not  surprising,  as  many  urban  food  assets  are  community-driven.  The   food  stakeholders  engaged  in  this  study  have  clearly  demonstrated  that  urban  food  is  going   beyond  backyard  gardens,  pointing  to  new  trends  in  urban  food  production.  The  emphasis   on  urban  food  assets  adds  to  an  emerging  field  of  studying  how,  given  the  shift  from  rural   to   urban   living,   cities   can   become   more   food-secure.   This   report   presents   and   expands   upon  the  assets  that  the  community  has  identified  as  central  to  their  food  system.

   A  Closer  Look  at  Urban  Agriculture  in  Durham  Region   The   Regional   Municipality   of   Durham   and   its   eight   member   municipalities   (Ajax,   Brock,  Clarington,  Oshawa,  Pickering,  Scugog,  Uxbridge,  and  Whitby)  contain  a  unique  mix   of  urban  and  rural  lands  (Figure   2).  The  Greenbelt  Act,  enacted  in  2005,  protects  some  of   the  rural  land  from  future  development  by  (shown  as   protected  area  in  green  on  the  map).   However,  large  swaths  of  rural  lands  that  are  classified  as  prime  agricultural  land  are  not   protected  (shown  as   prime  agricultural  land   in  yellow  on  the  map).  Large  chunks  of  these   unprotected   lands   have   already   been   approved   for   development   (shown   as   urban   expansion  pre-2006  and  post-2006,  in  light  and  dark  pink  on  the  map).   This   planned   urban   expansion   is   compounded   by   the   hundreds   of   thousands   of   acres   of   farmland   that   already   went   out   of   production   between   1991   and   2001   due   to   urban  development  (Walton,  2003).  Further,  much  of  Durham  Region's  prime  agricultural   land  is  producing  nursery  stock,  animal  feed,  and  food  for  export,  rather  than  food  for  local   consumption   (Contreras-Judge   et   al.,   2013;   Kubursi   et   al.,   2015).   The   loss   of   agricultural   land  and  the  lack  of  local  food  production  threaten  the  region's  ability  to  feed  its  growing   population.

   While  more  can  (and  should)  be  done  to  protect  the  region's  agricultural  land,  the   fact   remains   that   more   of   Durham   is   becoming   urban   land.   As   such,   it   is   necessary   to   learn   how   to   optimally   support   the   growing   of   food   in   urban   regions.   This   phenomenon   is   broadly  understood  as  urban  agriculture.   Urban  agriculture  denotes  such  urban  food  assets  as  backyard  gardens,  community   gardens,  farmers'  markets,  and  other  community  and  institutional  initiatives  such  as  seed   swaps.   Urban   food   is   produced,   processed,   and   consumed   locally.   This   process   engages   diverse  communities,  builds  strong  neighbourhoods,  and  increases  access  to  healthy  local   food.   Urban   agriculture   is,   by   nature,   integrated   in   the   social,   economic,   ecological,   and   cultural   systems   of   the   local   community   and   as   such,   has   the   potential   to   achieve   greater   local  food  system  sustainability  than  its  rural  counterpart  (Dubbeling,  Renting,  &  Hoekstra,   2015;  Jarosz,  2008;  Sonnino  &  Spade,  2014).

It  is  important  to  note  that  urban  agriculture  is  part  of,  but  different  than,  local  food.   Local   food   systems   broadly   encompass   all   aspects   of   food   designated   for   local   consumption,   including   production,   distribution,   processing,   and   retail.   The   boundary   of   local   food   is   both   permeable   and   variable,   but   focuses   on   agri-business   and   the   food   industry,  which  has  been  historically  focused  on  food  from  rural  origins.     The  local  food  movement,  which  is  gaining  momentum,  has  many  positive  effects  on   urban   food   systems.   The   Province   of   Ontario's   Local   Food   Act   (Bill   36,   2013)   and   the   auxiliary   Local   Food   Fund   (Rural   Economic   Development   Program,   2013)   support   a   strong   local   food   economy,   increasing   both   the   supply   and   demand   for   locally   produced   food.   The   first  annual  progress  report  on  the  Local  Food  Act,  focused  on  benchmarking  growth  in  the   industry,  reported  a  34  billion  dollar  contribution  to  Ontario's  economy  (Leal,  2015).   While   the   Local   Food   Act   is   progressive   and   a   significant   shift   toward   supporting   stronger   food   systems,   it   does   not   adequately   address   food   assets   outside   of   the   agri- industrial  focus.  The  food  community  in  Durham  has  identified  urban  food  assets  as  a  pillar   of  the  regional  food  system.  As  such,  it  is  necessary  to  learn  more  about  urban  agriculture   and  its  assets,  in  order  to  better  support  these  in  the  future.        99     

   Urban  Food  Assets  in  Durham  Region   Underscoring   the   urban   food   assets   presented   in   this   report   is   the   food   system   stakeholders.  Collectively,  they  are  the  greatest  asset  within  the  food  system  because  they   are   initiating,   operating,   supporting,   and   reporting   the   food   initiatives   presented   in   this   study.   The   community   is   made   up   of   multi-sectorial   food   stakeholders,   which   includes   community  members,  grass-roots  community  organizations,  not-for-profits,  and  municipal   and  regional  government  agencies.

The   Durham   Food   Map   project   provided   insight   into   both   key   food   system   stakeholders,  and  related  food  assets  in  Durham  Region.  This  report  focuses  on  the  urban   food  assets  that  were  identified  by  local  food  stakeholders,  categorized  as:   A. Community  and  Communal  Gardens   B. Community  Harvest  Trading  Tables   C. Food-related  Events  in  Durham   D. Foodscapes   E. Permaculture   F. Public  Greenhouses   G. Seed  Library   Each   urban   food   asset   category   presents   information   that   was   shared   by   food   stakeholders.   In   addition,   this   information   is   supplemented   with   information   gathered   online   and   from   field   notes,   and   through   interpretation   of   stories   told   by   the   local   food   community.   Collectively,   the   categories   highlight   community-identified   urban   food   assets,   and  serve  as  examples  of  programs  and  regulations  that  exist  to  support  the  regional  food   system.   Where   applicable,   the   categories   include   a   recommendation   to   the   Durham   Food   Policy  Council.

   A.  Community  and  Communal  Gardens   Community  gardens  are  most  closely   associated   with   traditional   notions   of   urban   agriculture,   where   gardens   are   established,   managed,   and   maintained   by   a   group   of   people.   These   people   are   often   associated   through   an   organization,   such   as   a   church,   school,   or   retirement   residence.   Durham   Integrated  Growers  (DIG)  maintains  a  dataset   on   current   gardens,   which   they   generously   volunteered   to   the   map   (Figure   3).   Community   gardens   are   currently   receiving   the   greatest   recognition   and   support   as   an   urban   food   asset   from   community   groups   (e.g.,  DIG)  and  government.  The  Township  of   Uxbridge,   for   example,   has   a   community   garden  policy  in  their  Official  plan:     "Community   gardens   help   to   support   people   who   could   not   otherwise   afford   the   time,   effort   and   land,   and   may   not   possess   the   skills   or   experience   to   maintain   gardens  on  their  own  property.  The  Township  supports  the  creation  of  community   gardens,   which   contribute   to   community   food   security.   Community   gardens   shall   be   permitted  in  any  area  of  the  Township  where  agriculture  operations  are  permitted,   provided   they   are   outside   of   key   natural   heritage   and   hydrological   features   and   related   vegetative   protection   zones   and   any   area,   which   may   have   soil   contamination.   They   shall   also   be   permitted   in   the   hamlets   and   in   the   Uxbridge   Urban  Area."     ­  Township  of  Uxbridge,  2014   Overall,   community   gardens   are   well   established,   supported,   and   understood   as   a   central   asset  of  the  urban  food  community.      Figure 3: Community gardens located throughout Durham

   Communal   or  neighbourhood  gardens   are  a  type  of  community  garden.  However,   instead   of   a   traditional   plot-based   model,   communal   gardens   are   established   as   a   shared   resource  for  the  surrounding  neighbourhood.  Where  community  gardens  are  created  and   maintained   by   an   existing   community   (e.g.,   church   congregation),   communal   gardens   create  a  new  community  who  converge  around  the  garden.  While  less  is  known  about  this   garden   model,   contributors   have   reported   very   successful   neighbourhood   gardens.   One   advantage  is  that  since  there  are  no  plots,  the  management  of  the  garden  is  shared  among   the   community,   which   puts   less   pressure   on   any   one   individual,   including   persons   with   disabilities.   The   Care   and   Share   Permaculture   Garden,   reported   by   the   garden   coordinator,   is   an   example   of   a   communal   garden   that   was   established   next   to   a   senior's   residence,   encouraging  them  to  participate  without  committing  to  exclusively  managing  a  plot:   "Inspiration for Starting It: A few of us attended "The Place to Bee: A Pollination Event" - at Lunar Rhythms CSA (just outside of Blackstock - I think the address is Janetville, so they are officially within the City of Kawartha Lakes region). A specialist had come to talk about her work in encouraging farmers to plant pollinators along ditches, between crops, etc. After attending this event, I volunteered at Happy Farm to learn about sustainable farming practices. At the same time, I read a book called, "The Stop". By late August 2013, fearing that our local fairgrounds would be re-developed into housing in the near future, I approached the Port Perry Agricultural Society, who hold the lease for this land (from the Township of Scugog). I was granted permission to start a project on a small parcel of land (1/3 of an acre) on the Northwest corner of the grounds. SO, LONG STORY SHORT - OUR GROWING KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD SECURITY AND FOOD JUSTICE, ALONG WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF LOCAL SCHOOL CHILDREN AND LONELY SENIORS ENCOURAGED US FORWARD. At this point, we have a core of passionate volunteers. We have decided that we can best serve the community by providing a demonstration garden that showcases sustainable methods of growing food, caring for others, and sharing our excitement with others!" ­ Care and Share Community Garden Coordinator

   The   We   Grow   Food   (WGF)   community   group   has   also   successfully   established   three   neighbourhood   gardens,   where   no   `community'   previously   existed.   The   first   garden   reported  was  the  Pepper  Patch:   Pepper Patch Garden "We Grow Food's first neighbourhood garden. In its first year (2014), 30 families worked in the garden and produced over 2500 pounds of food." ­ We Grow Food Communications Coordinator The   land   in   which   the   Pepper   Patch   Garden   was   built   is   owned   by   the   City   of   Oshawa.   The   city   approved   the   development   of   the   garden,   and   the   local   restaurant,   The   Table,  paid  the  necessary  insurance.  Neighbours  were  instructed  to  take  only  enough  food   to   feed   their   family   for   one   day.   Moving   into   its   second   year,   the   garden   was   expanded   and   is  now  independently  operated  by  a  community  coalition  of  local  residents.

   The  second  garden  reported  by  the  We  Grow  Food  team  is  Carol's  Neighbourhood   Garden.   The   contributor   shared   the   local   newspaper   article   written   about   the   garden,   which  demonstrates  the  broader  community  interest  in  the  neighbourhood  garden  model:   Carol's  Neighbourhood  Garden   "You   can't   miss   Carol   Cavallari's   house.   The   Oshawa   business   owner's   front   yard   stands  a  few  feet  taller  than  the  neighbouring  lawns  on  Grandview  Street.   From an apple tree to a kale patch, roughly 1,500 square feet of Ms. Cavallari's property has been transformed into a community garden that she refers to as her humble garden. A sign at the top of the yard reads, "This humble garden, plus three fruit trees out back, will produce about 1,000 pounds of food. That is 250 four-pound meals for a family." Located south of the Olive and Grandview intersection in Oshawa, the garden holds an open-door policy. With about 10 people taking and contributing, there are no permanent rules or fees. In fact, neighbours pop in and out as they please. "I've been eating her lettuce all summer," said Rose McIntosh, who lives two doors down. Ms. McIntosh regularly visits the garden and loves the kale, which overflows from its raised bed. Ms. Cavallari is the owner of The Table, a downtown Oshawa restaurant that serves dishes made of locally grown ingredients. Half of the yield of her garden goes to her restaurant, while the rest is offered free to the public. Since health and sustainability are a focus of her business, non-genetically modified and organic seeds are used in the community garden. ...see News Source Link for the rest of the article!"

The   Cordova   Street   garden   was   established   in   spring   2015,   following   the   same   implementation  model  as  the  previous  gardens.  It  is  already  proving  to  be  a  success,  as  a   community  is  forming  among  the  neighbours  living  in  the  high-density  area  (Figure  6).

Figure  6:  Beginning  the  new  Cordova  neighbourhood  garden   The   neighbourhood   garden   model   implemented   by   We   Grow   Food   has   been   incredibly   successful   in   these   three   instances,   establishing   both   a   garden   and   a   community   of   gardeners   where   neither   existed   previously.   To   better   understand   how   these   neighbourhood   gardens   came   into   being,   it   is   important   to   recognize   the   community   group   initiating  them.    We  Grow  Food  (WGF)  is  a  community  organization  that  was  started  by  a  group  of   enthusiastic   gardeners   in   Fall   2013,   who   decided   to   install   a   series   of   public   vegetable   gardens.   The   group   decided   to   focus   their   energies   in   disproportionally   underserved   neighbourhoods   when   they   became   aware   of   the   food   security   issues   in   Oshawa.   In   one   short  year,  the  WGF  community  group  imagined  and  implemented  26  family  garden  plots   and  two  large  neighbourhood  gardens.  In  doing  so,  over  100  volunteers  transformed  over   11,500  square  feet  of  empty  space  into  a  place  where  an  estimated  20,500  pounds  of  food         105  

   were   grown.   The   garden   engaged   over   160   families,   educating   them   to   sustainably   grow   healthy  food  with  their  community.  What  started  as  an  idea  has  sprouted  into  a  blooming   food  community.     Now   entering   the   second   year,   WGF   created   another   large   neighbourhood   garden,   the   Cordova   Garden,   which   also   includes   a   pollinator   garden   and   public   orchard.   The   neighbourhood  garden  model  established  by  WGF  is  having  a  significant  impact  on  urban   food   security.   Moving   forward,   the   process   of   establishing   these   gardens   in   neighbourhoods  where  no  previous  community  existed  needs  to  be  better  understood  so  it   can  be  implemented  more  broadly  in  the  Region  and  beyond.  To  expand  the  work  of  WGF   and  other  innovative  community  groups,  support  from  government  and  other  community   agencies  is  necessary.

   B.  Community  Harvest  Trading  Table   An  interesting  asset  reported  is  the  community  harvest  trading  table  (Figure  7),  or   more  commonly  referred  to  as  the  Tuesday  Trading  Table:   "Local gardeners are getting together to swap vegetables every Tuesday outside of the Table restaurant on Simcoe Street in Oshawa. No cash allowed... only trading vegetables and other edibles/seeds." To  elaborate  on  this  report,  Carol  Vandersanden  started  the  Tuesday  Trading  Table   outside   of   her   restaurant,   The   Table.   She   wanted   to   provide   local   urban   vegetable   gardeners   the   opportunity   to   share   and   trade   their   fresh   produce,   and   build   a   sense   of   community  among  the  urban  food  community.  The  Trading  Table  ran  every  Tuesday  from   August   to   October,   from   noon   to   6   PM.   Each   week,   dozens   of   people   attended,   with   the   numbers   increasing   as   awareness   spread.   Surplus   produce,   in   which   there   was   plenty,   was   donated  to  local  charities.  No  cash  was  allowed,  as  the  initiative  operated  strictly  by  trade   only.  However,  in  many  instances,  food  was  given  away  to  anyone  who  expressed  interest.   This   initiative   creates   opportunities   to   build   capacity   around   food   and   community   through   educating,  growing,  consuming,  sharing,  and  trading  the  harvest.

   C.  Food-related  Events  in  Durham   Multiple   food-related   events   reported   to   the   Durham   Food   Map.   For   example,   a   member  of  Durham  Integrated  Growers  shared  the  Table  Talk  event  series  (Figure  8):   "Want to get your vegetable seeds off to a good start? Join experienced market gardener John Nowakowski and learn his seed starting tips! Get practical and helpful advice regarding seed starting Soil Mediums, seeds, seed sources and timing."

   audience   of   community   members,   representing   a   range   of   novice   to   expert   food   growing   skills.  These  events  are  central  to  supporting  the  community  of  urban  food  growers.   Unfortunately,  the  Durham  Food  Map  was  not  optimally  designed  to  report  events   because  there  was  no  specific  location,  date,  or  time  fields  to  include  information  related  to   the   event.   Recognizing   the   need   for   a   central   repository   for   food-related   events   beyond   the   functions  offered  by  the  Durham  Food  Map,  the  We  Grow  Food  community  group  created   an  events  calendar,  available  on  their  website,  to  supplement  the  Durham  Food  Map,  which   is  currently  being  updated  regularly  to  keep  residents  up-to-date  on  food  events  happening   in  the  Region  (Figure  9).  This  calendar  was  a  good  first  step  toward  an  integrated  resource   for   community   food   events   and   initiatives   that   had   strong   early   usage.   However,   contributions   to   the   calendar   are   waning.   The   calendar   needs   to   be   linked   to   a   more   active   online  environment.

   D.  Foodscapes   Landscaping   with   edible   plant   material   is   a   unique   and   beautiful   way   to   intensify   growing  food  in  urban  spaces  (Figure  10).  While  few  residential  foodscapes  were  added  to   the  map  because  of  the  privacy  concerns,  there  were  two  contributions  about  food  grown   on  public  lands:   Foodscapes  in  Oshawa  public  gardens!  "Oshawa  has  been  planting  food  alongside   flowers,  creating  beautiful  foodscapes."  
  

More  foodscapes:  Oshawa  Valley  Botanical  Gardens  "Kale  planted  in  the   botanical  gardens  in  Valleyview  gardens,  downtown  Oshawa."   The   kale   planted   in   the   gardens   was   harvested   and   donated   to   Feed   the   Need   in   Durham,  where  staff  processed  and  distributed  the  kale  to  various  food  banks  throughout   the  Region.  Planting  food  in  existing  flowerbeds  did  not  require  major  changes  to  how  the   city   operationalizes   the   management   of   the   flowerbeds   (i.e.,   acquiring   seedlings,   planting   and   watering   schedules)   other   than   the   harvest   going   to   a   food   bank   rather   than   to   compost.   The   next   step   would   be   to   review   management   practices   to   determine   how   to   maximize  the  quantity  and  quality  (e.g.,  fertilizer  and  pest  management  that  is  safe  for  use   of  vegetables)  of  this  source  of  food.   Beyond  the  limited  contribution  gathered  here,  there  is  still  much  to  explore  when  it   comes   to   foodscapes.   Todmorden,   a   town   in   England,   is   a   brilliant   example   of   a   community   successfully   embracing   foodscapes.   The   motto   of   Incredible   Edible   Todmorden:   "if   you   eat,   you're  in";  everyone  is  a  stakeholder  in  producing  food  in  the  town  (McDougall,  2015).  The   food,  which  is  available  to  anyone  who  wants  it,  is  grown  along  the  main  walking  route  to   school,   at   the   local   police   and   fire   stations,   and   tucked   in   corners   of   parking   lots,   among   many   others   locations.   By   involving   all   members   of   the   community   in   the   growing   and   consuming  of  food  produced  in  town,  Todmorden  experienced  a  changing  culture  toward   growing  food  in  the  urban  environment.   It   should   also   be   noted   that   growing   food   in   non-traditional   farm   or   backyard   garden   locations   is   leading   to   issues   under   certain   conditions.   Bylaw   conflicts   prohibit   residents   from   growing   food   in   certain   areas,   such   as   boulevards.   These   present   legitimate      110  

   concerns   for   officials,   because   in   some   instances,   it   can   be   a   public   safety   hazard   when   large   plants   take   over   the   sidewalk   (Figure   11).   The   next   step   is   to   gain   a   better   understanding  of  the  potential  problems  and  benefits  to  residents  and  officials  in  order  to   work   toward   accommodating   growing   food   in   unconventional   urban   spaces   while   minimizing  potential  health  or  safety  concerns.

E.  Permaculture:  Pollinator  Gardens  and  Public  Orchards   Permaculture,   broadly   understood   as   permanent   agriculture,   refers   to   an   edible   ecosystem  that  relies  on  natural  earth  system  cycles  and  ecosystem  interactions  to  support   itself  (L.  Newman  &  Dale,  2009).  The  urban  food  community  identified  pollinator  gardens   and   public   orchards   as   permaculture-related   assets   that   are   contributing   to   the   regional   food   system.   Pollinator   gardens   incorporate   flowering   plants   into   gardens   to   attract,   and   create  a  habitat  for,  bees  and  other  pollinating  insects  (Figure   11).  This  urban  food  asset   also   adds   to   the   beauty   of   gardens   and   other   food   growing   spaces.   Public   orchards   were   also   reported   as   a   permanent   source   of   food,   however   they   are   in   the   process   of   being   developed  and  as  such,  photos  and  best  practice  have  not  been  developed  yet.

   F.  Public  Greenhouses   One   greenhouse,   which   was   initiated   by   and   built   at   a   school   in   Durham,   was   reported   to   the   map.   However,   the   need   for   public   greenhouse   space   was   expressed   multiple   times   by   multiple   stakeholders.   In   one   example,   a   stakeholder   acquired   Milkweed   seeds   and   wanted   to   start   seedlings   to   give   out   free   during   various   community   events.   Milkweed   is   not   edible   by   humans,   but   it   is   necessary   food   and   habitat   for   Monarch   butterflies.   After   a   lengthy   process   of   finding   greenhouse   space,   the   individual   borrowed   space  in  a  private  greenhouse  and  grew  over  1000  Milkweed  plants  that  were  distributed   to   the   local   community.   Public   greenhouses   are   a   new   idea   that   requires   further   investigation,  including  an  assessment  of  feasibility,  including  who  is  going  to  establish  and   manage   such   an   asset.   Overall,   the   food   community   expressed   public   greenhouses   as   a   central  need  to  better  support  urban  food  production.

   G.  Seed  Library   Evolving  from  decades  of  successful  seed  swaps,  seed  libraries  are  starting  in  many   communities.   The   local   library   often   manages   seed   libraries,   relying   in   their   established   base   of   patrons   to   donate,   borrow,   and   return   seeds.   One   such   library   was   reported   in   Durham  Region  at  the  Oshawa  Public  Library:   "The library is helping your garden grow this year! Have a look for the Need a Seed, Leave a Seed display at any branch and you may find just the seeds you need for planting this spring. The Oshawa Public Libraries, in support of agricultural sharing and preservation, will be hosting a Need a Seed, Leave a Seed display at all branches beginning this April, and running until the end of June. If you have extra seeds at home, you can share them with fellow community members by leaving them with the display. Simply ensure they are in a sealed and labelled envelope. This is a great way to try growing something new, or to share seeds of your own with others. Together, we can take this step towards preserving and promoting community sustainability and beauty! Take part in Need a Seed, Leave a Seed, and get growing!"    To   expand   on   the   information   provided   for   the   Durham   Food   Map,   the   Seed   Library  

program  was  established  as  a  pilot  project  in   2015.  Each  of  the  4  libraries  in  Oshawa  set  up   a   display   close   to   the   front   entrance   with   seeds   and   other   resources   to   support   urban   vegetable   growing   (Figure   12).   Library   officials   are   reporting   that   the   pilot,   while   still  ongoing,  is  considered  a  success  and  will   likely   run   again   in   2016.   The   library   has   learned   important   lessons   that   they   are   currently   documenting.   In   information   could   help   other   municipalities   in   the   region,   and   elsewhere,  establish  similar  programs.     Figure  12:  The  "Need  a  Seed,  Leave  a  Seed"     display  at  the  Oshawa  Public  Library

Supporting  Urban  Food  Assets  in  Durham  Region   The  food  community  has  identified   urban   food   assets  as  an  important  part  of  the   overall   strength   and   resiliency   of   the   regional   food   system.   This   community   consists   of   individuals,  community  groups,  not-for-profits,  and  government  agencies.  Collectively,  they   reported  on  community  harvest  events,  foodscapes,  neighbourhood  gardens,  permaculture,   and  seed  libraries  as  the  strengths  of  their  urban  food  system.  The  urban  food  community   also   reported   on   their   needs   and   challenges,   as   they   work   toward   innovating   the   local   food   system.

   Current  policies  are  generally  supportive  of  local  food,  but  do  not  always  explicitly   address   urban   food.   Provincially,   the   Local   Food   Act,   enacted   November   2013,   is   beginning  to  influence  the  local  food  system  but  does  not  have  an  urban  food  focus  (Leal,   2015).   Regionally,   the   Durham   Food   Charter   was   endorsed   by   Regional   Council   in   November   2009   and   is   currently   administered   by   the   Durham   Food   Policy   Council.   This   Charter  broadly  supports  local  food  in  the  region  but  similar  to  the  provincial  legislations,   does   not   focus   on   urban   food.   The   "Region   of   Durham   Community   Climate   Change   Local   Action  Plan"  (Durham  Region,  2012),  which  was  written  three  years  after  the  endorsement   of   the   Durham   Food   Charter   but   before   the   provincial   Local   Food   Act,   identifies   urban   agriculture  as  one  of  the  three  potential  programs  recommended  for  future  development  in   the  Local  Action  Plan:   "Urban Agriculture Program: Develop a thriving urban agriculture community within Durham with an emphasis on garden plots, community gardens, backyard gardening, sustainable agriculture, education, and community engagement. The Urban Agriculture Program would initially offer: · Educational farming fields located onsite at partner elementary schools, secondary schools, community centres, other community institutions, and interested residents' backyards. · Urban farming internships, workshops and volunteer opportunities. · A local compost program. · The opportunity to buy shares in the harvest. Harvest Festivals, Open Farm Days and other opportunities for broad community engagement.    116  

   The Urban Agriculture Program would also increase the carbon sequestration capacity of Durham's built environment, reduce food miles and implement key provisions of the Food Charter." ­ Durham Region, 2012 Municipally,   the   eight   municipalities   in   the   region   do   not   universally   implement   urban  food  policies  (Appendix   A).  In  fact,  only  three  of  the  municipalities  do  have  urban   food   policy.   The   Town   of   Ajax   has   the   strongest   and   most   detailed   urban   food   policies.   Under   "Theme   2.1:   Climate   Change   Context"   in   the   official   plan,   the   Town   addresses   the   goal   of   promoting   the   growing   of   food,   which   explicitly   addresses   urban   agriculture.   It   contains  both  permissive  policies  (e.g.,  allowing  growing  on  public  and  private  lands)  and   restrictive  policies  (e.g.,  excludes  raising  animals).     The  Township  of  Uxbridge  is  the  only  other  municipality  to  have  urban  food  policy   in  their  official  plan,  but  it  only  addresses  the  provision  of  community  gardens.     The  City  of  Oshawa  does  not  have  urban  food  policy  in  their  official  plan.  However,   the  Creating  Our  Sustainable  Tomorrow  Strategic  Plan  2013-2018  (City  of  Oshawa,  2012),   which  was  written  and  endorsed  by  city  council  contains  a  "Resilient  Local  Food  System"   theme   under   the   environmental   responsibility   category.   The   strategy   promotes   and   encourages   urban   agriculture,   as   well   as   backyard   and   community   gardening,   but   does   not   contain  specific  programs  or  regulations.     The   remaining   five   municipalities   do   not   have   urban   agriculture   policies   at   the   municipal   level;   instead,   they   rely   exclusively   on   regional   policies   to   govern   urban   food.   Given  the  community-identified  importance  of  urban  food  assets,  coupled  with  the  growing   support  of  local  food  at  provincial  and  regional  levels,  it  is  timely  to  pursue  the  universal   adoption   of   strong   urban   food   policy   in   all   municipalities   in   the   region.   The   lower-tier   municipal   governments   have   the   greatest   impact   on   what   happens   inside   of   the   urban   boundary,   and   are   responsible   for   building   permits,   animal   control,   bylaws,   street   and   sidewalk  maintenance,  parks  and  recreation,  and  the  bylaws  that  regulate  these  aspects  of   municipal   management.   At   the   time   of   writing   this,   both   Clarington   and   Whitby   were   undergoing   Official   Plan   reviews,   pointing   to   the   timeliness,   and   time-sensitivity   of   this   issue.        117  

   In   addition   to   strong   urban   food   policies,   permissive   regulations   and   supportive   programs   need   to   be   developed   to   enable   the   policy   intent.   Urban   food   assets   need   to   be   fostered,   encouraged,   and   continuously   innovated   to   significantly   contribute   to   the   resiliency  of  the  regional  food  system.   Thus,  it  is  recommended  that:   · Durham  Region  and  each  of  its  member  Municipalities,  in  partnership  with  the  urban  food   community,  review  existing  plans  and  make  appropriate  changes  to  inform  policy  intent   on  urban  agriculture.   o A   working   group,   comprised   of   a   range   of   government   and   citizen   stakeholders,   be   formed  to  support  the  creation  of  urban  food  policy,  which  is  to  be  adopted  by  all   eight  municipalities  in  Durham  Region.     o The   Region   and   each   of   its   member   Municipalities   develop   programs   and   regulations   that   support   urban   agriculture   initiatives,   including   community   gardens   on   both   public   and   private   lands,   harvest   trading   events,   permaculture,   neighbourhood   gardens,   pollinator   gardens,   public   greenhouses,   seed   libraries,   among  other  assets  still  to  be  identified.   o Bylaws  and  Official  Plans  be  amended  to  authorize  urban  agricultural  assets.   Moving  Forward   As   reported   in   this   study,   urban   food   assets   resonate   with   the   community   of   food   stakeholders  in  the  region.  Overall,  urban  agriculture  is  a  key  resource  for  nutritious  food   that   supports   the   health   and   well-being   of   the   population,   reduces   emissions   influencing   climate  change,  builds  communities  among  those  who  engage  in  urban  food  initiatives,  and   enables   greater   food   supply,   security,   and   sovereignty.   As   a   community,   we   need   to   encourage  and  support  the  expansion  of  food  grown  in  urban  areas.

6.  CONCLUSION:  LEARNING  FROM  VGI  SYSTEMS  

   Abstract   This  chapter  summarizes  the  major  findings  of  this  research.  Since  the  significance  of  the   findings   for   the   regional   food   system   are   presented   in   detail   in   Chapter   5   and   in   the   Crowdsourcing  Urban  Food  Assets  report  (Appendix  5C),  the  conclusion  focuses  primarily   on  the  relevance  of  this  work  to  the  VGI  and  Geoweb  areas  of  research.  

   Overall,   this   research   provides   a   guideline   for   implementing   VGI   systems   and   applied   it   to   Durham   Region's   food   system.   The   first   part   of   this   research   (Chapter   2)   establishes   a   working   framework   for   the   process   of   creating   VGI.   In   this   VGI   systems   framework,   the   project,   participants,   and   Geoweb   coalesce   with   the   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation   of   VGI.   In   identifying   the   project   and   purpose   as   a   crucial   component   of   the   system,   the   second   part   of   this   research   (Chapter   3)   explores   how   mapping  has  been  used  in  food  systems.  The  examples  contained  in  this  chapter  reflects  on   the   impact   mapping   can   have   on   understanding   the   food   system,   and   concludes   that   increased  engagement  in  the  mapping  process  leads  to  noteworthy  food  mapping  projects.   The   third   part   of   this   research   (Chapters   4   and   5)   implements   a   VGI   system   to   support  the  participatory  mapping  of  regional  food  assets  in  Durham.  Engaging  local  food   stakeholders   to   actively   contribute   information   on   food   assets   enabled   the   creation   of   an   open  dataset  on  food  assets  in  Durham  Region,  a  public  Web-based  food  map  resource,  an   urban  food  assets  report,  and  an  urban  food  policy  working  group.  The  implementation  of  a   VGI   system   made   a   significant   contribution   to   the   regional   understanding   of   urban   food   assets.  Overall,  the  VGI  systems  framework  was  used  to  engage  a  wide  range  of  food  system

   stakeholders  while  creating  new,  and  previously  unavailable  information  about  diverse  and   hyper-local  food  assets.     Beyond  the  benefits  realized  by  local  food  stakeholders,  the  process  of  establishing  a   VGI   system   addresses   important   topics   that   can   be   broadly   related   to   geographic   information  science.  This  final  chapter  concludes  the  research  with  a  series  of  reflections,   lessons  learned,  and  areas  for  future  research  that  are  especially  timely  as  research  related   to  VGI  continues  to  evolve  rapidly.  In  fact,  many  VGI  and  Geoweb  projects  currently  under   development  have  not  yet  been  formally  published.  Given  this  publication  lag,  these  lessons   are   rooted   in   current   literature   but   inspired   by   conversations   at   conferences,   research   meetings,  networking  events,  and  social  media.  The  following  lessons,  traversing  a  range  of   significance   for   future   research,   are   related   to:   conceptualizing   VGI,   building   and   democratizing   the   Geoweb,   investigating   the   impact   of   data   driven   geography,   exploring   the   intersection   of   VGI   and   citizen   science,   advancing   VGI   systems   applications,   and   finally,   considering  the  ethical  implications  of  this  research.

The  growing  pragmatic  influence  of  VGI  and  the  Geoweb  on  academic,  government,   and  societal  decision-making  is  evident  from  the  examples  and  case  studies  highlighted  in   this   thesis.   In   addition   to   the   empirical   application   of   the   VGI   systems   framework,   this   research   attempts   to   make   a   contribution   to   the   conceptual   understanding   of   VGI,   which   is   an  area  of  research  still  in  its  infancy.   This  work  on  the  conceptualization  of  VGI   systems   contributes   to   ongoing   work   that   theorizes  the   profound   shift   in   mapping,   data   generation,   and   community   engagement   (Haklay,   2013a;   Leszczynski   &   Wilson,   2013;   Rinner   &   Fast,   2015).   Building   on   these   conceptualizations,   this   work   developed   a   VGI   system   framework   to   propose   the   process   of   creating   VGI.   The   inherent   variability   in   crowdmapping   projects--active,   passive,   citizen   science--challenges   the   notion   of   a   one-size-fits-all   VGI   system.   As   such,   this   research   began   to   understand   the   relationships   and   connections   between   the   various   components   and   functions   of   VGI   systems.   With   further   refinement   and   application,   this   framework   can   be   applied   to   support   the   development   and   deployment  of  a  range  of  crowdmapping  projects.      123  

   In   addition   to   the   contribution   to   theoretical   considerations   of   VGI,   the   VGI   systems   framework   helped   to   clarify   the   (often   ambiguous)   differences   between   VGI   and   the   Geoweb.  Through  this  research  process,  it  became  clear  that  VGI  and  the  Geoweb  are  very   different  phenomena,  despite  being  used  interchangeably  to  refer  to  the  same  phenomenon   in   some   instances   (Leszczynski   &   Wilson,   2013).   The   process   of   establishing   a   system   capable  of  collecting  VGI  is  much  different  than  that  of  establishing  a  Geoweb  environment.   VGI   is   created   using   project,   participant,   and   Geoweb   components   for   the   input,   management,   analysis,   and   presentation   of   volunteered   geographic   content.   Conversely,   the  Geoweb  is  created  through  programming,  coding,  and  website  development  (to  name   only  a  few  of  the  tasks  involved).   While   VGI   and   the   Geoweb   are   not   the   same   thing,   they   are   complementary   in   nature.   The   online   mapping   infrastructure,   applications,   services,   and   platforms   encompassed  by  the  Geoweb  can  be  used  to  support  the  creation  of  VGI.  Similarly,  VGI  is   often  collected  by  way  of  the  Geoweb.  Despite  this  symbiotic  relationship,  not  all  Geoweb   environments  are  capable  of  collecting  VGI,  and  not  all  VGI  is  collected  via  the  Geoweb.  The   remaining  conclusions  in  this  chapter  are  organized  according  to  lessons  learned  relating   to   mapping   and   the   Geoweb   domain   (lessons   6.2   and   6.3)   and   the   VGI   systems   and   data   domain  (lessons  6.4  to  6.7).  

6.2  Think  Before  you  Build  
A   main   lesson   related   to   the   Geoweb   was   that   developing   a   custom   Geoweb   application   is   not   easy.   Initially,   this   research   started   as   a   collaboration   with   the   Neptis   Foundation,   a   not-for-profit   foundation   that   conducts   mapping,   research,   and   analysis   related   to   growth   management   in   Canada's   urban   regions.   Neptis   developed   a   Geoweb   tool   to   support   planning   and   policy   in   the   Greater   Toronto   and   Hamilton   Area   (Neptis   Foundation,  2015).  Dubbed  `engagement  by  visualization',  the  Neptis  Geoweb  integrates  an   online   Web   mapping   environment   with   hundreds   of   municipal,   regional,   and   provincial   planning   documents   and   data.   The   data   include   urban   rural   settlement,   historic   built-up   areas,  political  boundaries,  and  provincial  plans  including  the  Greenbelt  (2005),  Oak  Ridges   Moraine   (2002),   and   Niagara   Escarpment   (1973)   planning   areas.   While   not   previously      124  

   available   together,   these   data   tell   a   story   of   unprecedented   growth   across   the   Greater   Toronto   and   Hamilton   Area,   highlighting   both   the   connections   and   incompatibilities   between  plans.   The  Neptis  Geoweb  has  many  interactive  features,  including  the  ability  to  turn  map   layers  on/off,  zoom  to  predefined  geographic  areas,  query  data,  and  draw  features  on  the   map.   The   tool   was   also   designed   to   support   map-based   comments   and   conversations.   However,   the   VGI   capabilities   to   gather   and   display   crowdsourced   contributions   on   the   map   remained   underdeveloped,   and   did   not   sufficiently   address   the   requirements   of   the   Durham   Food   Map.   While   the   Neptis   Geoweb   continues   to   be   developed,   it   highlights   the   challenges   of   developing   a   custom   build   Geoweb   in   a   research-based,   time-sensitive,   or   time-limited  research  project.  In  lieu  of  a  custom-built  Geoweb  environment,  multiple  free   and  open  source  Geoweb  environments  are  capable  of  collecting  VGI  (explored  in  the  next   lesson),  which  adequately  served  the  case  study  in  this  research.   The   challenges   related   to   developing   a   custom-built   Geoweb   application   emphasized  the  divide  between  trained  mappers  (geographers,  cartographers,  GIScientists,   spatial   analysts)   and   computer   scientists.   Software   development   (i.e.,   coding,   programming)   and   other   skills   necessary   for   Geoweb   development   are   not   typically   taught   as  part  of  geographic  training,  despite  becoming  increasingly  important  in  research  related   to   the   Geoweb.   The   lack   of   programming   skills   in   university   and   college   level   geography   programs   leaves   those   with   computer   science   skills,   whether   trained   or   self-taught,   to   design   and   develop   Geoweb   environments,   regardless   of   cartographic   skill   or   training.   The   rapid   and   continued   development   of   the   Geoweb,   largely   by   individuals   not   trained   in   geography   or   cartography,   emphasizes   the   role   trained   mappers   can,   and   should,   play   in   the   future   of   Geoweb   development   to   ensure   the   cartographic   integrity   of   this   prolific   source  of  maps  being  used  by  society.    

6.3  Negotiating  Access  to  the  Geoweb    
Contrasting   the   challenges   surrounding   Geoweb   development   is   the   ease   of   use   and   accessibility   of   publicly   available   Geoweb   applications.   The   Geoweb   is   having   a   profound   impact   on   how   we   create,   use,   and   distribute   maps,   formally   and   informally   (Haklay,      125  

   Singleton   and   Parker,   2008).   This   research   is   evidence   of   that:   as   part   of   the   research   process,   dozens   of   maps   were   used   in   community   and   academic   presentations,   community   outreach,   map-based   storytelling,   and   promotional   material.   Despite   prolific   map   use,   traditional   GIS,   whether   proprietary   or   open   source,   was   not   used   at   all   in   this   project.   Instead,   this   entire   study   was   completed   using   freely   available   and   hosted   Geoweb   environments;   most   notably,   the   Neptis   Geoweb,   Ushahidi,   and   CartoDB.   This   is   evidence   that   mapping   is   becoming   more   accessible   to   the   broader   public,   with   minimal   to   no   software  costs,  and  ever  increasing  functionality.     With  the  growing  number  of  free  and  open  source  Geoweb  platforms  available,  one   area  of  applied  research  worth  pursuing  is  a  review  of  Geoweb  mapping  options  and  their   functionality.  These  include  commercial  applications,  such  as  ArcGIS  Online,  CartoDB,  and   GeoCommons,   which   have   both   free   and   paid   functionality.   There   are   also   privately   developed   Geoweb   environments,   such   as   Argoomap   (Ryerson   University),   GeoLive   (University   of   British   Columbia),   and   GeoKey   (University   College   London),   that   are   open   source   and   available   for   download   or   hosted   deployment.   These   options   require   more   knowledge  of  computer  programming,  and  are  not  as  accessible/usable  as  the  commercial   options,  but  available  no  less.  More  research  is  needed  to  understand  the  suite  of  options   available,   as   the   list   is   constantly   expanding.   Despite   the   range   of   accessibility,   usability,   and   functionality,   these   Geoweb   options   are   typically   more   feasible   compared   to   a   custom- built   Geoweb   application.   Knowing   what   is   available   is   the   first   step   toward   choosing   a   Geoweb  app  that  best  fits  the  project  at  hand.   6.3.1  Democracy  and  the  Geoweb       Accompanying  recent  mapping  and  Geoweb  developments  are  growing  implications   on  society.  As  such,  it  is  necessary  to  continue  to  learn  about  the  social  implications  of  its   influence.  Chrisman  (2005)  described  this  as  tracing  full  circle  when  contending  with  the   social  influence  of  GIS.  For  research  into  the  Geoweb  and  VGI  systems  to  come  full  circle,   there  is  a  continued  need  to  explore  the  implications  of  their  use.     Beyond  the  pragmatic  side  of  map  access  without  traditional  GIS,  this  discussion  fits   into   more   theoretical   conversations   about   neogeography   (Connors   et   al.,   2012;   M.   W.      126  

   Wilson  &  Graham,  2013),  democracy  (Haklay,  2013b),  and  the  accessibility  of  mapping  and   Geoweb   tools   (Cinnamon   &   Schuurman,   2012;   Johnson   &   Sieber,   2012a).   Neogeography,   in   contrast  to  academic  geography,  refers  to  the  use  of  mapping  technologies  by  non-expert   communities   and   is   touted   for   disrupting   traditional   authority   and   potentially   achieving   greater  democracy  in  mapping  (Connors,  Lei  and  Kelly,  2012;  Crampton,  2009;  Goodchild,   2009;  Haklay,  Singleton  and  Parker,  2008).  The  expectations  for  mapping  are  changing.  The   public   now   understands   maps   as   inherently   interactive   and   a   valuable   tool   for   locating,   visualizing,  and  storytelling  (Schuurman,  2009).   While   there   is   evidence   that   maps   are   being   developed   and   used   by   more   people   than  ever  because  of  the  Geoweb  and  open  source  developments,  Haklay  (2013)  rightfully   regarded   increased   map   development   and   use   as   a   delusion   of   democracy.   The   delusion   was  also  evident  in  this  study.  As  previously  stated,  the  project  was  completed  using  only   free  and  publicly  accessible  Geoweb  services.  However,  and  in  sharp  contrast,  none  of  the   stakeholders  engaged  in  the  process  knew  what  mapping  resources  were  available  to  them   or   how   to   use   them.   Further,   three   of   the   organizations   engaged   in   this   study   expressed   an   interest   in   acquiring   a   Geoweb   for   their   personal   sites,   using   a   mix   of   in-house   data   and   data   generated   from   this   study.   However,   as   smaller   not-for-profit   organizations   and   community  groups  with  no  dedicated  technical  or  mapping  staff,  none  were  able  to  develop   their  own  map  despite  the  desire  to  do  so.  Rather,  an  intermediary  would  be  necessary  to   support  map  development  and  maintenance,  even  using  free  and  publically  available  Web   mapping  applications.   6.3.2  Role  of  the  Intermediary     The   Geoweb   is   enabling   greater   accessibility   to   mapping,   but   it   is   not   universally   accessible,   calling   for   a   better   understanding   of   what   barriers   exist   that   limit   widespread   access   to   mapping   tools.   This   research   highlighted   the   necessity   of   the   intermediary.   In   particular,  what  role  does  the  intermediary  play,  and  in  what  context?     Increasingly,  geographers,  cartographers,  and  spatial  analysts  seem  well  positioned   to   facilitate   this   role.   In   a   2008   interview   with   Dr.   Michael   Goodchild,   Dr.   Nadine   Schuurman  asked  "does  the  changing  authority  of  geographic  information  and  its  emphasis      127  

   on   representation   somehow   change   the   authority   of   GIS   specialists   in   geography?"   ­   Goodchild  responds,  "I  think  it  will  eventually.  I  think  there's  always  going  to  be  room  for   the   qualified   professional"   (Schuurman,   2009,   pp.   573­574).   That   `eventually'   is   now.   In   government  and  citizen  interaction  using  the  Geoweb  and  VGI...  A  recent  report  from  the   government   of   Canada   highlighted   the   role   of   the   intermediary   for   government   agencies   to   realize   the   benefits   of   VGI:   "cost   reduction   and   efficiency   requirements   will   see   more   government   Geomatics   organizations   outsourcing   processes   to   the   private   sector,   partnering  with  VGI  data  providers  and  others,  and  focusing  on  the  roles  of  commissioning   and   managing   the   delivery   of   a   complete   location   information   framework"   (Hickling   Arthurs  Low,  2013,  p.  40).  

6.4  Data-Driven  Geography  
Transitioning   to   lessons   related   to   VGI,   this   research   highlighted   the   relevance   of   data-driven  geography.  Geographic  information  studies  typically  operated  in  a  data-scarce   environment,   and   as   such,   many   GIScientists   focused   on   creating   new   algorithms   and   methods   to   support   the   analytical   capabilities   with   the   data   that   was   available   (Miller,   2004;  Unwin,  1996).  However,  the  ways  in  which  geographic  data  are  accessed,  analyzed,   and  presented  is  changing  due  to  the  influence  of  Web  2.0  technologies,  the  Geoweb,  and   other   forms   of   media   and   technology   that   are   capable   of   collecting   geographic   information,   leading  to  a  data-rich  environment  (Miller  &  Goodchild,  2014).  It  is  necessary  to  investigate   the   types   of   data   emerging   from   this   data-rich   environment,   which   are   grouped   into   big   data,  open  data,  and  data-information-knowledge  discussions.   6.4.1  Big  Data   Big   data   is   categorized   according   to   the   Vs:   volume,   velocity,   and   variety;   and   the   more   recently   added,   value   and   veracity   (Miller   &   Goodchild,   2014).   Big   data   most   often   has   a   location   component   (i.e.,   geographic   coordinates,   address   information,   or   city   name),   making  it  relevant  to  geographic  information  studies.  While  the  limits  of  big  data  are  still   being  debated  and  contested,  Graser  (2014)  defined  the  threshold  of  big  data  as  data  that   analysts,  computers,  or  GIS  software  do  not  yet  know  how  to  handle.  Thus,  the  threshold  is   a   moving   target.   Once   we   are   able   to   handle   and   extract   information   from   the   data,   it   no      128  

   longer  is  big  data.  Adhering  to  this  definition,  the  active  VGI  studied  in  this  project  does  not   cross  the  big  data  threshold.  In  fact,  very  few  if  any  projects  that  collect  active  VGI  are  big   data   projects,   not   even   OpenStreetMap   because,   given   Graser's   definition,   we   know   how   to   manage  and  use  the  data.   Where   big   data   does   seem   more   relevant   to   VGI   is   when   users   contribute   digital   footprint   and   passive   VGI.   These   types   of   passive   VGI   are   most   closely   associated   with   Goodchild's   (2007)   `citizens   as   sensors'   perspective.   Fischer   (2012)   referred   to   this   type   of   data   as   `involuntary   geographic   information',   while   Stefanidis,   Crooks,   &   Radzikowski   (2011)   called   it   ambient   geospatial   information.   More   research   needs   to   be   done   on   the   contribution  of  VGI  to  big  data.   6.4.2  Open  Data   Open   data   are   defined   as   the   provision   of   raw   data   by   government,   in   which   governments   provide   the   data   that   are   licensed   to   share   (more)   freely   with   citizens   (Johnson  &  Robinson,  2014;  Lauriault  &  Mooney,  2014).  Sieber  &  Johnson  (2015)  identify   four   models   of   open   data.   The   first   is   simple   data   provision,   where   governments   are   providers  of  data.  This  is  a  big  step  for  many  governments,  as  they  need  to  consider  legal,   ethical,  accessibility,  data  standards,  and  other  considerations  before  freely  providing  raw   data   (Lauriault   &   Mooney,   2014;   Scassa,   2014).   Next   is   the   code   exchange   model,   where   governments   support   data   use   and   benefits   through   interactive   approaches,   such   as   civic   hackathons  (Johnson  &  Robinson,  2014).     Third,  Sieber  &  Johnson  (2015)  identify  civic  tracker  issue    as  a  model  for  open  data   where   governments   accept   feedback   (i.e.,   crowdsourcing)   on   a   limited   range   of   issues   to   maintain  and  improve  existing  data.  Finally,  the  participatory  open  data  model  denotes  the   co-production   of   data   between   authoritative   sources   (i.e.,   government)   and   new   citizen   generated  data  (i.e.,  VGI).  The  participatory  open  data  model  is  going  beyond  simple  data   provision   to   opening   new   channels   for   citizen   engagement   with   governments   and   integration   into   the   decision-making   environment   in   order   to   achieve   various   outcomes,   policy  or  otherwise  (Sieber  &  Johnson,  2015).

   Given   these   various   models,   the   data   generated   by   this   research   fit   into   the   participatory   open   data   model,   albeit   with   one   major   exception:   the   open   data   generated   did   not   come   exclusively   from   a   mix   of   government   and   citizen   sources.   Rather,   the   largest   data   contributions   came   from   the   private   sector,   which   included   NGOs   and   community   groups.  Sieber  &  Johnson  (2015)  only  very  briefly  indicate  the  potential  to  extend  citizen- government  data  co-production  to  private  or  not-for-profit  actors.     This  research  uncovered  an  unexplored,  and  largely  untapped,  source  of  data.  These   data   were   previously   gathered,   managed,   and   housed   by   local   NGOs   and   community   groups,  and  contained  information  on  various  elements  of  their  area  of  specialty.  The  co- production   between   various   NGOs   and   community   groups,   a   hybrid   existing   somewhere   between   authoritative   and   citizen-generated   data,   tapped   into   an   existing   network   of   actors   and   existing   data   resources.   In   addition   to   the   data   generated   in   this   study   now   being  publicly  viewable  and  downloadable  (i.e.,  open),  it  connected  the  actors  by  engaging   them  to  share  their  information  with  each  other  and  the  Durham  Food  Policy  Council.  It  is   important   to   further   explore   how   to   foster   contributions   from   NGOs   and   community   groups   and   incorporate   them   into   the   open   data   arena   for   maximum   benefit   to   government,  NGOs,  and  the  community.   6.4.3  Data,  Information,  and  Knowledge  in  VGI   The  term  `VGI'  is  most  often  used  to  refer  to  the  data  or  the  dataset  generated,  and  is   inaccurately  referred  to  as  `VGI  data'  (Cinnamon  &  Schuurman,  2012;  Connors,  Lei,  &  Kelly,   2012;   Fischer,   2012;   Haklay,   Antoniou,   Basiouka,   Soden,   &   Mooney,   2014;   Hickling   Arthurs   Low,   2012;   Lauriault   &   Mooney,   2014;   Neis   &   Zielstra,   2014;   Seeger,   2008;   and   many   others).   However,   in   the   context   of   the   data-information-knowledge   hierarchy   (Poore   &   Chrisman,   2006),   what   the   public   is   contributing   contains   elements   of   data   (e.g.,   latitude/longitude),   information   (e.g.,   points   of   interest),   and   knowledge   (e.g.,   value   statement  about  point  of  interest).  As  such,  user  contributions  on  the  participatory  Geoweb   can  be  more  accurately  described  as   content  (Rinner  &  Fast,  2015).  To  avoid  a  neologistic   debate,  in  this  research,  VGI  is  used  to  refer  to  the  full  range  of  user  contributions.

   While   data   (or   more   specifically,   datasets)   and   information   are   important   for   VGI,   the   knowledge   of   the   contributor   can   be   particularly   relevant   when   trying   to   understand   the   origins,   authority,   and   impact   of   VGI.   VGI   contributions   can   be   broadly   thought   of   in   two   dimensions:   professional   and   local   (Figure   6.1).   For   example,   OpenStreetMap   contributors   can   be   professionals;   such   as   when   a   trained   cartographer   with   photogrammetry   experience   digitizes   features   on   the   earth's   surface   from   a   satellite   image   of  an  area  he/she  does  not  know.  They  can  be  local;  for  example,  an  individual  adds  local   shops   while   walking   around   his/her   neighbourhood.   To   borrow   from   Coleman,   Georgiadou,  &  Labonte  (2009),  contributions  can  be  neophytic;  new  to  the  subject  and  the   skill.   For   example,   untrained   individuals   contribute   to   disaster   relief   efforts   by   adding   roads,  buildings,  and  other  features  of  places  they  are  not  familiar  with.  Finally,  they  can  be   professional   and   local   if   an   individual   with   map   training   contributes   content   to   an   area   he/she  knows.  

   Figure  6.1:  The  range  of  VGI  contributor  characteristics   These   distinctions   become   important   when   working   on   disaster   relief   efforts.   When   mapping  a  new  area  from  satellite  imagery  to  aid  in  relief  efforts,  there  could  be  significant   variation   between   the   contribution   of   locals   in   their   neighbourhoods,   mapping   professionals  without  personal  knowledge  of  the  area,  and  untrained  non-local  individuals.     In   this   research,   contributions   were   always   from   participants   in   Durham   Region   (local),   were   sometimes   from   experts   in   the   food   system   (professional),   but   given   the      131  

   methodology   employed   in   this   study,   were   not   neophytic.   However,   these   distinctions   in   contributor   knowledge   were   not   conveyed   in   the   final   VGI   dataset.   Further,   despite   the   varying  degrees  of  knowledge  represented  in  the  content,  the  entire  dataset  was  classed  as   VGI.  Now  that  the  dataset  is  open  and  available  for  download  by  the  public,  it  is  not  entirely   distinguishable   from   traditional   geographic   information.   Rarely   is   there   data   about   the   creator,  or  any  other  metadata  (data  about  data)  for  that  fact.  It  raises  the  question:  should   data  about  the  contributor's  knowledge  or  skill  be  included  in  VGI?   The  range  of  contributor  characteristics  in  VGI,  yet  lack  of  metadata  to  convey  the   distinctions   in   contribution   knowledge,   can   be   related   to   the   ongoing   debate   around   the   concept   of   authority   in   VGI   (Flanagin   &   Metzger,   2008;   Goodchild,   2008).   Arguably,   the   origins   of   the   creation   are   relevant   once   the   VGI   is   presented   as   an   integrated   dataset,   further   reinforcing   the   imperative   to   start   thinking   of   the   systems,   perhaps   even   the   science,  which  support  the  creation  of  VGI.  Getting  to  know  the  process  that  creates  VGI  can   help   understand   ongoing   issues   instigated   by   its   creation   and   use,   such   as   metadata   and   data   quality,   role   of   intermediary,   participant   inequality,   and   use   in   government,   to   name   a   few.    

6.5  VGI  and  Citizen  Science  
There  are  a  growing  number  of  comparisons  between  VGI  and  citizen  science.  While   each   has   a   unique   set   of   processes,   methods,   outcomes,   and   implications,   there   are   many   overlapping   themes   between   the   two.   This   most   notably   includes   the   broader   public's   participation  in  something  that  was  typically  reserved  for  professionals.  In  some  cases,  VGI   and  citizen  science  are  used  interchangeably,  and  they  often  appear  as  keywords  together.   Despite   their   similarities,   VGI   and   citizen   science   are   indeed   different.   Citizen   science   focuses   on   the   publics'   contribution   to   more   traditional   notions   of   science,   and   the   contributions  may  or  may  not  include  a  `geographic'  component.  VGI  focuses  on  volunteers'   contribution   to   geographic   information,   which   may   or   may   not   have   a   `scientific'   component.     Research  in  both  of  these  areas  is  expanding,  but  it  seems  many  more  researchers   are   working   toward   understanding   the   process   of   citizen   science   given   its   broad   public      132  

   appeal   (Wiggins   &   Crowston,   2015),   whereas   the   study   of   VGI   has   remained   largely   contained   within   the   academic   discipline   of   geography.   While   the   research   contained   in   this   dissertation   only   briefly   addressed   citizen   science   as   an   example   of   VGI,   there   is   far   more   to   learn   from   citizen   science.   Citizen   science   is   further   strengthened   by   the   well- established  Citizen  Science  Association,  the  Citizen  Science:  Theory  and  Practice  journal,  and   research   projects   that   are   engaging   sizable   communities   all   over   the   world.   Given   the   similarity   between   citizen   science   and   VGI,   and   the   well-established   citizen   science   paradigm,   an   important   area   of   research   would   be   to   understand   how   VGI   and   citizen   science   intersect.   The   interconnection   between   citizen   science   and   VGI   could   be   an   important  step  to  unlocking  their  potential  in  both  the  traditional  science  and  geographic   information  science  spheres.  

6.6  VGI  systems:  Beyond  Food  to  Mental  Health  and  Air  Quality  Monitoring  
Relatively   few   organizations   outside   of   the   academic   discipline   of   geography   -- government,   business,   or   community--use   the   term   VGI.   However   there   is   a   growing   demand  for  VGI  services  among  these  groups.  They  want  to  employ  online  mapping  tools   and  engage  in  crowdmapping  and  citizen  science  for  both  data  generation  and  community   engagement   purposes.   While   there   are   many   organizations   wanting   and   choosing   to   employ   these   tools,   few   have   the   expertise   or   experience   to   operate   such   tools.   Two   organizations   in   Toronto   that   are   currently   implementing   VGI   systems   are   the   Centre   for   Addiction  and  Mental  Health  and  the  Clean  Air  Partnership.  There  is  much  to  learn  from  the   processes  they  have  undertaken  to  achieve  public  engagement  through  crowdsourcing.  The   following   two   subsections   introduce   their   projects,   and   the   challenges   and   opportunities   presented  within.  It  is  with  continued  refinement  of  the  VGI  systems  framework  that  better   processes   can   be   designed   to   meet   the   growing   need   for   crowdmapping   within   these   organizations.   6.6.1  Crowdsourcing  Mental  Health  Resources   The   Centre   for   Addiction   and   Mental   Health   (CAMH)   recently   prioritized   alternative   approaches   to   engaging   more   people,   especially   youth,   in   mental   health   advocacy,   policy,   and   research   development.   One   particular   impactful   alternative   approach   was   a      133  

   participatory   mapping   project   that   brought   together   post-secondary   students   from   the   University   of   Toronto,   Ryerson   University,   and   the   Ontario   College   of   Art   and   Design.   Together,  they  created  Thought  Spot:  a  crowdsourced  map  of  mental  health  and  wellness   services   in   Toronto   (Hart   &   Fast,   2015).   The   goal   of   the   project   was   to   empower   post- secondary   students   to   build   their   own   mental   health-promoting   interactive   Geoweb   that   supports  improved  awareness  of  services  in  the  Toronto  area.   The  initiators  at  CAMH  wanted  the  project  to  be  led  by  students,  which  was  further   reinforced   by   the   original   `For   Students,   By   Students'   project   name,   later   changed   to   `Thought   Spot'   by   the   students   who   took   lead   on   the   project.   Since   the   initiators   wanted   students   to   take   ownership   of   the   project,   they   did   not   interfere   with   project   development.   Instead,   to   mediate   between   CAMH   and   the   student   group,   they   hired   an   intermediary,   a   digital   media   consultant,   to   manage   the   project.   The   intermediary   gathered   the   team   of   student   volunteers   from   the   various   universities,   but   provided   only   minimal   guidance   regarding   the   development   and   direction   of   the   project.   The   hands-off   approached   initially   proved   to   be   a   challenge   for   the   students   involved   because   they   did   not   fully   understand   the   purpose   of   the   project   and   needed   stronger   guidance   before   they   were   able   to   take   ownership  of  the  Through  Spot  project.  However,  in  the  end,  a  valuable  map  resource  was   created  that  supported  the  accessibility  of  mental  health  and  wellness  resources  relevant   for  post  secondary  students.     Active   project   development   is   completed,   but   the   map   resource   and   various   maintenance  tasks  persist,  which  are  sustained  by  students  paid  for  by  CAMH.  The  project   provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  study  the  process  of  establishing  a  VGI  system,  including   the   organization   of   the   project   and   development   teams,   the   engagement   of   participants,   and   the   mapping   environment   used.   Further,   it   also   provides   an   opportunity   to   evaluate   the  deliverables  of  the  project  now  that  it  has  wrapped  up.  The  VGI  systems  framework  will   be  applied  in  a  retroactive  reconstruction  to  report  on  the  development  and  deployment  of   the  Thought  Spot  project,  which  may  in  turn  also  support  the  continued  refinement  of  the   framework.

   6.6.2  Crowdsourcing  Air  Quality  Monitoring   The   Clean   Air   Partnership   is   a   Toronto-based   NGO   that   works   to   transform   cities   into  sustainable,  vibrant,  and  resilient  communities,  where  the  air  is  clean  to  breathe  and   greenhouse   gas   emissions   are   minimized.   As   a   part   of   their   mission,   their   applied   research   and   community   engagement   efforts   aim   to   broaden   and   improve   access   to   public   policy   debates   on   air   pollution   and   climate   change   issues.   An   integral   part   of   this   work   is   air   quality   monitoring.   However,   traditional   equipment   is   expensive,   stationary,   temporally   sparse,   and   does   not   provide   continuous   nor   universally   accessible   data   to   the   public.   Recognizing   the   need   for   better   availability,   access,   and   engagement   with   air   quality   monitoring,   the   Clean   Air   Partnership   is   looking   into   participatory   crowdsourcing   of   air   quality  data.   Currently,   the   Clean   Air   Partnership   has   created   a   forum   to   open   the   discussion   about   potential   issues,   solutions,   and   problems   that   crowdsourcing   air   quality   can   address,   what  issues  may  potentially  arise,  and  how  to  mitigate  those  issues.  These  early  meetings   attracted   over   30   organizations   representing   government,   NGO,   academic,   and   private   interests,   highlighting   the   interest   of   citizen   science   in   tracking   levels   of   pollutants.   Collectively,   these   stakeholders   recognize   the   potential   of   collaborative   air   quality   monitoring   to   give   voice   to   clean   air   advocates   from   all   over   the   community,   not   only   helping   to   bring   together   data   but   also   serving   as   a   forum   for   community   engagement,   revenue  generation,  and  policy  change  support.  The  institutional  support  for  crowdsourced   air  quality  monitoring  is  further  enabled  by  mobile  monitoring  advancements;  the  variety   and  availability  of  monitors  is  growing  with  many  new  technologies  entering  the  market  in   just  the  last  few  months.     The   shift   away   from   government-led   to   community-driven   air   quality   monitoring,   however,   is   not   without   challenges.   Out   of   all   of   the   air   quality   stakeholders   engaged,   none   have   experience   with   a   citizen   science,   crowdsourcing,   or   VGI   approach.   A   key   theme   throughout  the  preliminary  meetings  was  the  growing  need  for  an  intermediary  to  support   this  transition.  While  this  project  is  only  in  its  early  phases,  a  VGI  systems  approach  could   help  facilitate  the  implementation  by  addressing  the  process  required.  Overall,  if  the  Clean   Air   Partnership   is   able   to   successfully   navigate   the   intersection   of   citizen   science   with      135  

   governmental  air  quality  monitoring,  it  could  build  a  large  community  of  clean  air  partners,   leading  to  a  greater  understanding  of  how,  when,  and  where  poor  air  quality  is  of  greatest   concern.   While   local   food,   mental   health,   and   air   quality   monitoring   are   separate   domains,   they   share   the   same   goals   of   engaging   the   broader   public   while   producing   VGI.   The   studies   highlighted  here  further  highlight  the  importance  of  continued  study  into  the  systems  that   support  the  creation  of   VGI.  What  do  these  projects  have  in  common?  What  can  they  teach   us   about   future   projects?   How   do   they   fit   within   the   VGI   systems   framework?   Understanding  the  process  of  establishing  VGI  systems  will  help  scientists,  researchers,  and   community  organizations  better  design,  implement,  and  study  them  in  the  future;  moving   us  closer  to  using  VGI  systems  as  a  framework  to  further  engagement  and  inquiry.  

6.7  VGI  and  Ethics    
A  dominant  stream  of  research  is  the  legal  and  ethical  side  of  location  information,   which   has   become   especially   paramount   in   the   Web   2.0   era.   Leading   the  legal   side   of   the   VGI   and   open   data   research   is   Scassa   (2013,   2014),   who   identified   copyright,   intellectual   property,   and   privacy   as   the   dominant   issues   within   this   type   of   work.   Existing   ethical,   legal,  and  practical  issues  related  to  archiving  qualitative  research  data  (Parry  &  Mauthner,   2004)   are   amplified   when   they   are   collected   and   then   made   open   and   available   to   the   public.   This   project   was   mindful   of   these   issues,   and   sought   ethical   review   through   the   University  Research  Ethics  Board  (REB).     Overall,   the   university   ethics   process   was   both   challenging   and   useful.   The   REB   application  proved  to  be  a  challenge  because  the  process  of  establishing  a  VGI  system  did   not   adhere   to   the   standard   REB   form-fillable   application.   Questions,   such   as   the   sample,   timeframe,   data   type,   were   difficult   to   answer   because   the   process   of   collecting   user   contributions   is   as   controlled,   as   it   is   in   experimental   research.   While   the   VGI   systems   framework   imposed   bounds   on   the   process   development,   the   sample   was   still   largely   unknown  and  dependent  on  `volunteered'  (rather  than  requested)  contributions.     Interestingly,  the  process  of  completing  the  REB  application  prompted  the  research   design   to   consider,   and   in   some   cases,   adhere   to   more   traditional   data   collection   strategies      136  

   early   on   in   the   process   of   establishing   the   VGI   system.   Arguably,   this   led   to   greater,   yet   not   complete,  control  over  the  variables  in  the  project.  In  fact,  questions  about  sample  on  the   REB   application   was   one   reason   this   project   targeted   local   food   stakeholders   as   the   primary  contributors.  However,  there  were  still  gaps  in  the  REB  application  that  do  not  yet   address   emerging   ethical   and   legal   issues   associated   with   novel   and   evolving   Web-based,   location-based,  and  crowdsourced  research  projects.   To  supplement  the  REB  approval,  additional  criteria  were  established  to  ensure  the   ethical   operation   during   the   design   and   implementation   of   the   VGI   system.   First,   an   advisory  board  was  sought  and  established  to  help  make  crucial  decisions  about  scope  of   project,  project  management,  and  contribution  vetting.  It  was  also  decided  that  no  personal   location   information   be   released;   e.g.,   the   location   of   a   home   garden.   As   the   project   progressed,   it   became   clear   that   there   are   tensions   between   citizens   and   the   government   that   regulate   and   restrict   vegetable   growing   outside   of   the   traditional   farm   or   backyard   gardens.  Given  these  tensions,  contributor  information  was  supressed  to  ensure  the  study   did   not   put   any   contributor   in   conflict   with   existing   bylaws   or   regulations.   The   self- imposed   ethical   guide   highlight   the   need   for   all   research   ethic   boards   to   consider   updating   their  standard  forms  to  be  more  accommodating  of  emerging  sensitivities  related  to  online,   location,  and  crowdsourced  research  projects.  

6.8  Final  Thoughts  
The   dissertation   presented   here   undertook   novel   research   related   to   the   phenomenon   of   VGI,   combining   both   theoretical   and   applied   contributions.   Theoretically,   this  research  established  a  framework  to  guide  the  process  of  creating  VGI.  It  then  applied   that   framework   to   Durham's   food   system.   The   Durham   Food   Map   case   study   made   a   significant   contribution   to   Durham's   urban   food   system,   filling   information   gaps   for   the   Durham  Food  Policy  Council  and  facilitating  connections  across  the  diverse  and  hyper-local   food   system   stakeholders   operating   within   Durham   Region.   Finally,   this   research   concluded   with   lessons   related   to   Geoweb   development,   democracy   and   the   Geoweb,   data- driven  geography,  VGI  and  citizen  science,  other  applications  of  VGI  systems,  and  VGI  and

   ethics   issues.   It   seems   clear   from   this   research   and   the   lessons:   VGI,   the   Geoweb,   and   related  advancements  are  making  a  significant  impact  and  appear  to  be  here  to  stay.     VGI   systems   are   not   fixed;   rather,   they   are   constantly   re-produced   in   their   development,   application,   and   adoption.   Moving   forward,   it   is   important   to   continue   to   refine   the   VGI   systems   framework   to   harness   volunteered   geographic   information   for   decision-making   at   various   levels,   meeting   the   needs   of   government,   not-for-profit,   and   private  communities  alike.  There  is  a  nascent  focus  on  the  interoperability  of  multiple  VGI   projects,  which  will  only  be  realized  through  iterative  design.  In  a  time  when  research  on   VGI  is  still  in  its  infancy,  the  VGI  systems  framework  is  well  positioned  to  facilitate  further   advancement.   My   hope   is   that   other   researchers   will   take   the   lessons   from   this   body   of   work  and  use  it  to  strengthen  both  food  systems  and  VGI  systems.
