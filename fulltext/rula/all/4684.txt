ALTERNATING POLYSTANNANES: SYNTHESIS, PREPARATION, CHARACTERIZATION AND A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY Master of Science, 2015 Shane Harrypersad Molecular Science Ryerson University

Abstract
Polystannanes have been synthesized by a number of useful routes. Generally, these polymers have been limited to homopolymers containing a single type of substituent. We now demonstrated a novel condensation polymerization utilizing dialkyl or diaryl tin dihydrides and dialkyl tin diamides to prepare alternating polymers with neighbouring tin centers possessing different group functionalities. Three new alternating polystannanes containing both organically solubilizing (n-Bu, Me) and less solubilizing (Ph) side groups as well as the homopolymer dibutylpolystannane have been prepared. A variety of closely related model tristannanes using the same synthetic methodology was also completed. We have also carried out a computational study of a number of model stannanes in order to optimize structures of the oligo- and polystannanes synthetically prepared and predict their spectral properties by using time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). This study has yielded results that can be influential in predicting chemical orientation, bonding properties and electronics.

Chapter 1- Introduction
Polystannanes are main group polymers that possess a backbone containing Sn atoms bonded to each other in a linear, repeating fashion -(R2Sn)n- (where R = alkyl or aryl).1 These unique organometallic polymers are natural semi-conductors and have been considered for use as flexible polymeric wires in electric circuitry.1 Ideally, materials of this type are envisioned as plastic wires that can be processed, printed in a roll to roll fashion, are tunable and may potentially be more efficient than their copper analogues.2 These materials were originally discovered in the late 1800's; however many important developments and discoveries have only occurred with these materials in the last 25 years.1 The breakthroughs came mainly in the form of new synthetic techniques that allowed for relatively straightforward preparations of polystannanes in high yield, high purity and good reproducibility.2 Further investigations of their electronic properties have demonstrated that these materials behave similarly to other Group 14 materials of similar structure: polygermanes, or polysilanes.2,3 Unlike polyacetylene which uses a - network to transport electrons, polysilanes, polygermanes and polystannanes utilize a - delocalized system to shuttle electrons throughout the backbone, making them intrinsic semi-conductors.4 The conductivity of group 14 polymers may be enhanced with doping, which increases the efficiency of electronic transport of these materials.4

However, polystannanes present a few specific challenges that must be addressed before of commercial applications or potential can be fully realized. These challenges are their susceptibility to nucleophilic attack and their propensity to be photodegraded. Polystannanes are vulnerable to moisture in the atmosphere, which can break Sn-Sn bonds via nucleophilic attack of OH2 lone pairs towards the Lewis acidic Sn centers. The Sn-Sn bond is relatively long and the overlap is diffuse due to the compartively large size of the Sn valence orbital (5p). As a result, the orbital overlap which weakens the bond and leads to increased susceptibility.4 The second concern stems from exposure to photons possess enough energy (approximately 400 nm) to excite an electron in this bond.5 When these photons interact with the weak Sn-Sn bond they cause photoscission and create two very active tin radicals, which through multiple rearrangement processes, form smaller degraded polymers, oligomers or cyclics. NMR (119Sn) of the photodegraded products indicate that the majority of oligomers formed are inert and chemically uninteresting 5- or 6- membered stannyl rings.3,4 Progress in solving these long-standing, seemingly insurmountable problems with polystannanes require new synthetic methodologies and strategies to successfully and reproducibly prepare high yield, stable polymers with minimal undesirable side products. Figure 1.2 shows the known synthetic routes to these polymers.5

Figure 1.2 Various polystannanes via different polymerization techniques. The first major advancement in the preparation of polystannanes was demonstrated by Tilley and coworkers in 1993.5 They showed that a dehydrocoupling reaction of dialkyl or diaryl tin dihydrides using a zirconocene catalyst could effectively result in the formation of the desired polystannanes.5 These simple tin dihydrides were readily synthesized via a hydrogenation of a tin dihalides. Dialkyl and diaryl tin dihalides can also be used to form polystannanes via reductive Wurtz coupling (Price et al. 1996) or electrochemically (Okano et al. in 1998).

Both Wurtz

coupling and dehydropolymerization methods used to prepare polystannanes share common problems in achieving consistent high molecular weights, low PDI, are often low yielding and are relatively expensive to prepare. Research in this field was relatively dormant until Caseri et al. employed Wilkinson's dehydropolymerization catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3 with dialkyl tin dihydrides to produce high molecular weight polydialkylstannanes that were essentially oligomer free.8 This afforded the first opportunity to characterize properties the properties of polystannanes that were
3

cyclic free.

The results of these characterization studies have proved invaluable to a more

complete understanding of these systems.9 The main points of interest are that polystannanes are susceptible to red light, water in the air but are oxidatively stable as well as relatively stable to heat. In 2010 Foucher et al.10 were able to show that catalyst-free, thermally driven dehydrocoupling of tin dihydrides was possible.10,11 This discovery dramatically reduced the expenditure of these polymers as the catalysts are costly. The second outcome was that it showed these polymers are thermally stable (>200 Â°C) which for semi-conductors is a valuable asset as heat has shown to increase conductivity.11

Chapter 2-Objective and Scope
The objective of this project was to determine a new synthetic route and an entirely new classification of polystannanes with a backbone consisting of different R groups on each neighboring atom. The synthesis of these polymers, as well as their characterization is covered in Chapter 3. These concepts and techniques are further examined with model trimers. These oligostannanes were extensively studied by a multitude of techniques including TD-DFT. The TDDFT study was then expanded to review and update previously synthesized molecules and to create a wide library of stannyl compounds that can be further referenced as a comparative study. Chapter 4 covers this work in detail. Chapter 3: Harrypersad, S.; Foucher, D. Chem. Commun., 2015, 51, 7120-7123. Specific contributions by both authors are evident in the preceding publication. S. Harrypersad was responsible for all of the synthesis, characterization and interpretation of the work as well as production of figures and an original version of the manuscript. D.

Chapter 3- Alternating Polystannanes: Syntheses and Properties
3.1 Â­ Abstract A new condensation polymerization route leading to Alternating Polystannanes is presented. The stoichiometric reaction of tin dihyrides and tin diamines in diethyl ether or toluene under mild reaction conditions afford three new moderate molecular weight Alternating Polystannanes, [Ph2Sn-Alt-Sn(n-Bu)2]n-, -[Ph2Sn-Alt-SnMe2]n-, -[Me2Sn-Alt-Sn(n-Bu)2]n- in addition to a known homopolymer -[Sn(n-Bu)2]n-. 3.2-Introduction

For more than 20 years, dialkyl and diaryl homopolystannanes have been prepared by reductive coupling of either tindichlorides7,8,12-17 or tindihydrides.5,6,9,18-33 These intriguing polymers possess a backbone of -  delocalized6,7,8,12,15-24,26,24 organotins envisioned for use as processable intrinsic semiconductors12-15,18,24,26,33 or printable polymeric wires.13-17,23 Along with the considerable synthetic challenges in preparing later Group 14 polymeric materials is their profound sensitivity to moisture and light5,6,8,9,12,16-21,31-33 increasing down the period. In the case of polystannanes, the Lewis acidic nature of formally Sn(IV) centers results in weak -  overlap between neighbouring tin centers and a likely cause of their inherent susceptibility.6,18,21,23,22-26,28 Despite the original promise of these materials, a

relatively limited number of researchers have continued to pursue improved alternative synthetic methods and stabilization strategies with polystannanes. Dialkylpolystannanes, Â­ [R2Sn]nÂ­, (R = Et9,17-21,24-26,28,30, Pr9,17-21,25-26,28, n-Bu5,6,7,15-18,22-26, hexyl8,20,22-24, etc.) are soluble in most organic solvents where as diarylpolystannanes (R = Ph28 etc.) are often considerably less soluble but demonstrate a dramatic red shift of the -* transition in the UV-visible range in addition to their increased stability. Random dialkyl ( n-Bu, octyl,
6

dodecyl) and diphenyl polystannanes were recently prepared by Caseri et al.9 via a two-step Na Wurtz coupling in liquid ammonia. The recovered polymers are only partially THF soluble and of moderate molecular weight.18 Polystannanes with improved light stability were afforded by utilizing ethyl spacers directly attached to tin were also described by Caseri et al.9,25-28, 32 This was done in part to facilitate dehydrocoupling with a bulky Rh catalyst as a minimum of an ethyl spacer unit must be present separating the tin atoms from an aryl carbon.31 Our approach to preparing polystannanes employs condensation polymerization where both diaryl and dialkyl substituents can be introduced alternatively into the backbone to ensure increased solubility32 and, surprisingly, an improved degree of light stability. Toluene or Et2O solutions of equimolar quantities of high purity tin dihydrides and tin diamides (NMR) were added together at 0Â°C to facilitate optimal polycondensation conditions. 18,34 This condensation (Scheme 3.2.1) produces volatile diethyl amine, which along with the reaction solvent, is removed in vacuo resulting in the recovery of a relatively pure polymer.

Scheme 3.2.1 Preparation of alternating polystannanes Related examples of oligostannanes prepared by transmetalation or condensation were described independently by both DrÃ¤ger and Sita. DrÃ¤ger et al.11,34 prepared a series of oligostannanes with one to four (t-Bu)2Sn moieties as the central core capped on each end with a Ph3Sn unit. Sita et al.23 carried out a careful, stepwise condensation of (n-Bu)2SnH2 with (n-

Bu)2Sn(OCH2CH2OEt)(NMe2) in the presence of a strong base to produce linear oligostannanes

7

containing 3-15 tin atoms. For both the DrÃ¤ger and Sita oligomers, a red shift of the -* transition was observed with increasing catenation. 3.3-Results and Discussion Alternating polystannanes prepared by polycondensation of tin hydrides with tin amides are listed in Table 1. Four starting materials, (n-Bu)2SnH2 (1), Ph2SnH2 (2), (n-Bu)2Sn(NEt2)2 (3) and Me2Sn(NEt2)2 (4) were prepared in good yield following literature methods.25,35 The choice of these starting materials was based on ease and safety. Dimethyltin dihydride, Me2SnH2, is a gas at room temperature and is extremely toxic.36 All possible combinations of polymers were then made incorporating the four compounds listed above.

The polystannane (Â­[(n-Bu)2Sn]nÂ­), 5, was chosen in order to validate the condensation polymerization process, as extensive characterization of this homopolymer has been previously carried out. Under an inert atmosphere in the absence of light, an ethereal solution of 1 was added slowly at 0Â°C to a Schlenk flask containing 3 in Et2O and the mixture allowed to react for 3 hours at 0Â°C. The solvent and diethylamine co-product were then removed in vacuo.

Condensations were carried out at 0Â°C in an effort to avoid thermally promoted selfpolymerization of the heat sensitive alkyl or aryl stannyl dihydrides, as well as to limit possible termination reactions. Polymer 5 was recovered as a brightly yellow coloured solid and characterized by NMR (119Sn, 1H,

analysis showed the polymer to be of modest molecular weight (Table 3.3.1). Three new alternating polymers, 6 (Â­[Ph2Sn-ALT-Sn(n-Bu)2]nÂ­), 7 (Â­[Ph2Sn-ALT-SnMe2]nÂ­), and 8 (Â­ [Me2Sn-ALT-Sn(n-Bu)2]nÂ­) were also synthesized using the same methodology. Their data is listed in Table 1. The calculated elemental analysis was based on the relative degree of polymerization of the sample and accounts for the uncertainty in the process.

Fig. 3.3.2 Polystannanes 6 and 7 after exposure to ambient light for 7 days

A hydrostannolysis45 reaction of the two difunctional monomers results in the release of HNEt2 and formation of Sn-Sn bonds; thus promoting a facile condensation polymerization. This type of condensation has previously been demonstrated in part by others for tin systems, including oligostannanes,
23

but to our knowledge has not been used exclusively for the preparation of

polystannanes. This methodology allows for the reaction to be carried out in a single vessel, at modest temperature, with short polymerization period(s) and proceeds without the aid of an external catalyst. The phenyl-containing polymer derivatives 6 and 7 (Figure 3.3.2) showed increased chemical stability to light and moisture in the solid state with exposure up to 5 days with no apparent loss of colour or change in the
119

Sn NMR spectroscopic profile. Similar stability of

homopolystannanes bearing phenyl derivatives as side groups was reported by Tilley.6 Under these same conditions, the alkylated polymer 8 experienced a more rapid degradation with a noticeable colour change from a yellow semi-solid texture to a white powder; possibly this represents formation of a stannoxane. Polymer 5 degraded to a similar white powder in much the same way as previously described by Tilley and others.5, 6, 16-18, 24, 38

There is no evidence (NMR) for either end group in any of the polymers prepared by condensation. As all efforts were made to keep samples away from reactive solvents or moisture, it is presumed that one of the terminal ends contains a Sn-H bond and, the other a Sn-NEt2 containing unit. Alternatively, termination maybe the result of macrocyclic cyclization and an absence of end groups. DSC analysis of 5 produced by our condensation polymerization shows a nearly identical glass transition (Tg = 1oC) to polymers of 5 produced by reductive coupling.19 Polymer 5 recovered from the catalyst free condensation polymerization described earlier is a yellow coloured solid absent of 5- and 6-membered cyclic stannanes (GPC, NMR).9,13,18 The alternating polystannanes 6 and 7 (Table 3.3.1) display higher glass transitions (6 Tg = 117Â°C, 7 Tg = 118Â°C) compared to the homopolymer (5 Tg = 1Â°C), while a slightly lower glass transition (Tg = -6oC) was detected for the mixed dialkyl polystannane 8. Like 5, polymers 6, 7 and 8 appear to be amorphous with no detectable melt transition in the scan range (-50 to 225Â°C).

Fig. 3.3.4 GPC of polymer 7 in THF

The GPC analysis (Table 3.3.1) for the condensation polymers (5-8) shows PDI's between 2 and 3 with the value expected for an ideal condensation polymerization to be closer to 2. With the exception of the 7, the molecular weights of polymers prepared by condensation are lower than polystannanes prepared by dehydrocoupling reactions. The triple detection GPC traces of polymers (Figure 3.3.4) appear to be monomodal for the most part. DrÃ¤ger et al.11, 34, Sita et al.2, and others16-21, 22-26, 28-32 have observed a red shift of the -* max transition with increasing catenation. What differs in the previous studies with this work is that two of the polymers (6, 7) have two phenyl rings near each Sn-Sn bond with one tin possessing a direct Sn-Caromatic bond. The aromatic rings are themselves capable of  + orbital mixing with Sn, but can also act as a chromophore to absorb light energy that might damage Sn-Sn bonds. The polymer remains reasonable soluble in solution as the repeat unit consists of at least two dialkyl substituents

(Me or n-Bu). Figure 4 shows the UV-Vis spectra of the alternating polymers as well as for the homopolymer 5 prepared by condensation, which is in good agreement with literature values.25

Polystannanes 6 and 7 comprised of alternating alkyl and aryl substituents display a small redshift (10-15 nm) of their -* transition relative to 5 (max = 379 nm) while a blue shift of similar magnitude (16 nm) was observed for the mixed alkyl polymer 8. The redshift of polymers 6 and 7 is likely a consequence of + conjugation from the Ph substituents attached to Sn.23

3.4-Conclusions A new condensation route to homopolystannanes and previously unknown alternating polystannanes has been demonstrated. This thermally favourable condensation reaction offers a relatively straightforward process and enables design features that could lead to even more light and moisture stable polystannanes.

4.1-Abstract A series of model linear tristannanes, ((1R)3Sn)2(2R)2Sn (9: 1R = 2R = n-Bu, 10: 1R = Ph, 2R = nBu, 11: 1R = Me, 2R = n-Bu, 12: 1R = n-Bu, 2R = Ph, 13: 1R = Me, 2R = Ph, 14: 1R = n-Bu, 2R = Me, 15: 1R = Ph, 2R = Me) were prepared by condensation reactions of one equivalent of a dialkyl or diaryl tin diamide or dihydride and two equivalents of a trialkyl or triaryl tin hydride or amide respectively, and characterized by NMR (1H, 13C, 119Sn) and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. An LSDA/SDD level of DFT and TD-DFT for trimers 9-15 predicts significant structural differences as a function and nature of the substituents bound to tin and calculated electronic transitions for these compounds in fair relative agreement with experimental results. Calculated electronic spectra obtained from equivalent DFT studies of the sequentially lengthened oligomers Ph3Sn[t-Bu2Sn]nSnPh3 (16-19 where n = 1-4) previously prepared by DrÃ¤ger are in good agreement with the reported experimental UV-visible spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction data which show a red shift of the -* absorption transition (max) and bond lengthening and bond angle widening of the central tin atoms as the oligostannane is extended. TD-DFT studies of the alkoxy terminated di(n-butyl) oligostannanes 20a-m (CH3CH2OCH2CH2[Sn(n-

Bu)2]nCH2CH2OCH2CH3); n = 3-15) indicate lower limiting energy gaps as the polymer chain size is increased. The calculated data deviates significantly from results found experimentally by Sita
16

and suggests that even smaller energy gaps are possible if the polymer (21) resides in an all trans configuration. TD-DFT studies at the LSDA/SDD level were also carried out on a model oligoand polystannane 16 (H[SnH2]nH, n = 1-40) to investigate the impact of Sn catenation on the intrinsic band gap of the material and compared to both the Si and Ge analogues 22 and 23 (H[MH2]nH, M = Si, Ge: n = 1-40). The modelling of the polymetallanes reveals the expected limiting energy gap of the -* transition in a trans-planar configuration with Sn (2.681 eV) < Ge (3.096 eV) < Si (3.719 eV) in good agreement with previous studies by Takeda. Finally, comparison of the TD-DFT calculated data for model alternating oligostannanes (24-26) with the UV-Vis spectroscopic data for alternating polystannanes (27-29) recently prepared by polycondensation is made. 4.2-Introduction Conductive polymers have found useful applications as ITO(Indium tin oxide)-free replacement materials in photonic devices40 and as semi-conducting polymers for organic thin-film transistors (OTFT)41. While -conjugated organic materials, such as PEDOT (Poly(3,4-

ethylenedioxythiophene) are of prevailing interest for such applications42, considerably less attention has been turned towards the use of processable -conjugated inorganic materials, such as polystannanes. By understanding how to manipulate structural features to achieve the desired electronic properties, materials may be endowed with such properties in a rational way. To a degree, the factors which affect the electronic properties of linear polystannanes are understood6,4344

, and while considerable improvement in the utility of these materials to make them industrially

useful is still required, predictive tools available to computational chemistry44 may resolve the current gray areas in comprehension. Structural predictions for large sets of molecules can be rapidly screened for their desirable properties and lead to tailored materials with improved conductivity, light stability, moisture resistance and solubility. In this work we propose both an
17

experimental and theoretical investigation of oligostannanes, of ligand effects on the band gaps of these materials and the stability contributions of various aspects to the Sn-Sn bond for the purposes of achieving stable, potentially conductive materials. Compared to the higher Group 14 elements silicon and germanium, tin forms the weakest covalent metal-metal bonds45-47 (BDE for single  bond: Sn-Sn 146 kJ/mol, Ge-Ge 188 kJ/mol, SiSi 222 kJ/mol)48; oligo- and polystannanes do not easily remain as catenates and show increased sensitivity to light and moisture. Tin catenates are interesting for the fact that, structurally, they resemble saturated hydrocarbons, yet they exhibit conjugation that is more typical of -bonded alkenes. Instead, organotin polymers possess a highly delocalized, -conjugated backbone due to the diffuse overlap of 5px orbitals of neighbouring Sn centers.45 Analogous -conjugation had been noted previously for polymers with either Si-Si or Ge-Ge backbones, with polysilanes and polygermanes showing absorption maxima (max) approaching the near-UV of the UV-vis absorption spectrum.45 In oligostannanes and polystannanes, the backbone acts as a chromophore that is responsible for the characteristic absorption peak that is observed from the near-UV through to the visible spectral region depending on the substituents attached to tin and on the length of the oligomer itself.49 The absorption maximum of oligo- and polystannanes has been assigned to a -* transition (HOMO/LUMO) based on polysilane studies50, and serves as a useful probe of the first band gap. The -* transition is a key observable in deciphering the relationship between structure and electronic/optical properties of polystannanes. A comprehensive understanding of polystannane structure-property relationships affords skillful manipulation of this band gap. Based on the current study, and those already conducted in the literature, only modest alterations in the band gaps of polystannanes have been achieved. The magnitude of the band gap rests on several
18

key structural attributes. Firstly, the choice of metal atom can be rationalized. According to theoretical calculations performed by Takeda and Shirashi for the simplest polymetallanes (H[MH2]n-H, where M = Si, Ge and Sn) in a TP (trans planar) configuration, the band gap decreases in order of atomic number (H-[SiH2]n-H: 3.89 eV > H-[GeH2]n-H: 3.31 eV > H-[SnH2]n-H: 2.80 eV), with the narrowest band gap inherent to polystannanes.41 Experimentally, the same trend was observed in the series of dibutyl-substituted polymetallanes [M(n-Bu)2]n, where the band gap energies are [Si(n-Bu)2]n: 3.95, [Ge(n-Bu)2]n: 3.70 and [Sn(n-Bu)2]n: 3.20 eV, respectively.50-52 Secondly, geometrical deformation modifies the polystannane band gaps. Bulky side groups, such as t-Bu, widen Sn-Sn-Sn bond angles and elongate Sn-Sn bond lengths 11,41, resulting in weakened ss and pp couplings (skeleton Sn atomic orbitals) and a narrowing of the band gap.43 When [SnH2]n is substituted to [Sn(t-Bu)2]n, theoretical band gap calculations predict a 26% reduction in the band gap energy.43 Thus, calculations were extended to consider the possibility of achieving a metallic state by opening the Sn-Sn-Sn and H-Sn-H bond angles. When Sn-Sn-Sn angles are greater than 150Âº, the conduction band and valence band are predicted to overlap. The effects of such distortions suggest that a metallic state can be obtained by applying pressure to films or solid polystannanes. In addition to deformation, the band edge states are greatly affected by polystannane conformation. In all trans-planar polysilanes and polystannanes, twisting primarily affects the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) due to its pz character, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is less responsive because of its s character and symmetry.
43,50

The difference between [SnH2]n with an all trans-planar (TP) or all

gauche-helical (GH) conformation, is a broadening of the band gap by about a factor of 1.5.43 Correspondingly, cyclic tin oligomers exhibit a blue shift in absorption peak as the planar arrangement in small rings changes to the twist and gauche conformations in larger rings. 11 In a polystannane chain with various TP and GH segments, the longest TP chromophore absorbs at the
19

longest wavelengths while the longest GH chromophore absorbs at the shortest wavelengths. A distribution of absorption components, determined by the length and conformation of chromophore segments, contribute to the overall absorption peak (Figure 4.2.1)53 TP conformation provides the narrowest band gap and optimal conjugation along the backbone.11 Powder X-ray diffraction has been used to ascertain the conformation of H[(p-t-Bu-C6H4)2Sn]nH, whose 7/3 helical T3GT3G0 structure has been proposed to be "optimized" to an all TP conformation24, and so o-Et was introduced to H[(o-Et-C6H4)2Sn]nH as a directing group in order to constrain a TP conformation. Results show a greater conjugation since the -* transition redshifted to 468 nm; 30 nm relative to both H[(p-t-Bu-C6H4)2Sn]nH and H[(p-n-Hex-C6H4)2Sn]nH.6

Figure 4.2.1: Contributions to the absorption peak from Sn-Sn chromophores of varying lengths and conformations. Lastly, substituent effects on the polystannane band gap must be considered. Alkyl substituents do not directly affect the band gap, other than by deformation of the tin backbone.43 However, by destabilizing the HOMO, permethylation of -[SiH2]n- indeed decreases the band gap.50 The change in energy is expected to be similar for various alkyl substituents on polystannanes. With aryl substituents, a more dramatic change to the band gap is expected. Compared to
20

poly(dialkylstannane)s, the -* transition of a low molecular weight poly(diarylstannane), H[SnPh2]nH, was redshifted by 70 nm to 402 nm.49 Furthermore, para-substituted -[(p-RC6H4)2Sn]n- (R = t-Bu, max = 432 nm; n-Hex, max = 436 nm) led to a 30 - 40 nm redshift with respect to analogous poly(dialkylstannane)s.5 Incorporation of para-substituted -donating groups on aryl substituents, such as -[(p-n-BuO-C6H4)2Sn]n-, further narrowed the band gap by presumably destabilizing the HOMO.47 Moreover, the combined effect of a directing group in conjunction with a -donating group, in -[(o-Et-p-n-BuO-C6H3)2Sn]n-, produced the lowest band gap recorded to date (max = 506 nm; 2.3 eV).6 Evidently, aryl substituents showed significant - conjugation with the tin backbone. With -[(o-Et-p-n-BuO-C6H3)2Sn]n-, only moderate molecular weights (Mw < 5000 Da) could be achieved. However, the overall effect on the band gap may only be comparatively assessed for high molecular weight polymers. Upon catenation, tin oligomers exhibit a redshift of the -* transition; regardless of substituent type .2, 11, 45 The same trend is true for polysilanes, as well as polygermanes.45 As the number of metal atoms approaches thirty, the redshift plateaus to a limiting wavelength value,52 although an exception was noted recently in [(p-nBuO-C6H4)2Sn]n- (n = 30; max = 424 nm; n = 80; max = 448 nm).6 In 1992, a route to high molecular weight (HMW) polystannanes by Wurtz coupling was accomplished by Zou and Yang, and later optimized by Molloy et al.8,12 Around the same time, linear oligostannanes, with up to 15 tin atoms in the backbone were synthesized by Sita et al. via hydrostannolysis.
2,52,56

Well defined and reproducibly prepared HMW polystannanes were also

successful prepared by Tilley and co-workers through metal-catalyzed dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes.5,6,
24

Electrochemical synthesis of HMW dialkyl substituted polystannanes

reported by Takeda et al. has rounded out the roster of synthetic methodologies.7 Cyclic oligostannanes are typically present as byproducts of polystannane degradation during synthesis. Polystannanes are known to be air- and light-sensitive, requiring protection from the ambient
21

environment.8,11,35,and 49 More specifically, polystannanes can withstand oxygen exposure, but are vulnerable to moisture.17 A possible solution to stability issues, while wielding control over the band gap, is to impose alternating "push-pull" ligands or groups onto the tin oligomers. Push-pull species are often, but not limited to, -conjugated, vinyl substituted benzenes with diametrically opposed donor and acceptor groups. Notably, they feature spatially separated frontier orbitals which are localized onto each group. The HOMO is constrained to the donor substituent while the LUMO is constrained to the acceptor substituent. By modifying the substituents, the electron density can be shifted predictably by such a "push-pull" effect.57 Less dramatic effects are anticipated for polystannanes with less - orbital mixing, such as -[(push)2SnSn(pull)2]n- with alternating alkyl and aryl substituents or for asymmetrical polystannanes, -[(pull)Sn(push)]n-, bearing one alkyl and aryl substituent per tin atom. However, it is clear that tunable modification of the substituents along the polystannane backbone is possible and that electron density can be shifted predictably by a "push pull" approach.57 Previous models which attempted to capture electronic or optical properties of tin oligomers were generally performed at the semi-empirical level of theory. HÃ¼ckel molecular orbital (HMO) theory was developed for conjugated organic systems but displayed competency in correlating chain length behaviour of oligosilanes
58,59

, and the theory was also successfully applied to short tin

oligomers up to six atoms.45 When a larger experimental dataset of tin oligomers with up to fifteen metal atoms was obtained by Sita et al., the HMO theory was no longer successful on its own. An augmented version of HMO theory, the Sandorfy model C approximation, was next considered.52 This model had been effectively used for polysilanes and represented the polysilane backbone as interacting sp3 hybrid orbitals. Two parameters characterized the resonance integrals of vicinal (vic) and geminal (gem) sp3 orbitals. Their ratio,gem/vic, indicated the degree of MO
22

delocalization over the polymer backbone; gem/vic = 0 for total localization of MOs, gem/vic = 1 for absolute delocalization.50 The model was applied to the full dataset of tin oligomers and was found suitable for describing the delocalized HOMO of heavy atoms in the more metallic tin backbone when a gem/vic ratio of 0:75 was assumed.52 Other models, such as Sandorfy H, account for the LUMO, focusing on the interaction between the backbone and substituent orbitals.50 Elaborations on these descriptive models have shown that the simple intuitions of HMO theory still hold.60 By employing ab initio methods such as DFT where the effective core potentials of tin are accounted for, structure predictions can be made without the requirement of existing experimental data.61 In this work, we attempt to validate TD-DFT methods quantitatively against UV-vis absorption data for a series of new mixed alkyl and aryl tristannanes prepared by condensation, known oligoand polystannanes, as well as qualitatively against complementary theoretical studies. Finally, these TD-DFT methods are applied to a recently prepared series of alternating "push -pull" polystannanes and these results are further discussed.50

Diethylamine was distilled and kept dry over activated molecular sieves. All glassware was first dried in an oven then flame dried to remove surface moisture. 1H NMR (400 MHz),
13

C NMR (100.6 MHz) and 119Sn NMR (149.2 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance

400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a BBFO 5-mm direct probe. A 1H pulse width of 30Â° was used, acquiring a spectral window of 8223 Hz (20 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 1s, acquisition time 3.98s, 32k points (16 scans). The 1H 90Â° pulse width was 10.4 Âµs. A 13C pulse width of 30Â° was used, acquiring a spectral window of 24038 Hz (239 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 2s, acquisition time 1.36s, 32k points (4096 scans). The 13C 90Âº pulse width was 8.7 Âµs. A 119Sn pulse width of 30Âº was used, 8.75 Âµs, acquiring a spectral window of 100000 Hz (670 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 1s, acquisition time 0.33s, 32k points (15360 scans) with inverse gated proton decoupling. All results were analyzed on MestReNova LITE 5.2.5 software. Chemical shifts were calculated using the chemical deuterated standards (C6D6 or CDCl3) as a reference for 1H and 13C. The
119

Sn was referenced to SnMe4 as an internal standard. All J coupling values are reported as

absolute values. UV-Vis evaluations were carried out using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UV-Vis spectrometer. Original samples were collected in the range of 300-800 nm. All samples were prepared in THF at a concentration  1 Ã 10-3 M. Elemental Analysis was performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. of Norcross Georgia. All reactions took place under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere or in a sealed Schlenk flask placed under reduced pressure (closed) or finally in a Schlenk flask exposed to dynamic reduced pressure (open). Pressures measured in mmHg using a mercury manometer attached to the Schlenk line.

as implemented by the corresponding keywords in the Gaussian program.

Performance of these functionals and basis sets were generally comparable in terms of accuracy relative to known solid-state structures. In studies of structurally related tin oligomers, with some series members containing more than six tin atoms, geometries were optimized using the HartreeFock (HF) method and the basis set SDD to reduce computational time requirements. For the shorter molecules studied, optimization with HF gave comparable bond lengths and angles with DFT methods. The minimum character of optimized structures was verified by evaluation of the harmonic vibrational frequencies. Electronic spectra were calculated using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) 67 with the LSDA density functional and the SDD basis set. 4.3.3-Synthesis of the Compounds 9 Â­ 15 Precursor compounds A-D (Figure 4.3.3.1) were prepared and characterized according to our earlier report of these monomers for polycondensation reactions leading to polystannanes.68 Trialkyl and triaryl stannanes (E-F) and amines (G-H) were prepared in a similar fashion to the dialkyl and diaryl stannanes 69 and stannides 43 from the reaction of the respective tin chloride with reducing agents such as LiAlH4 or NaBH4 or from the metal halogen exchange reaction with lithiated diethylamine. The complete data for compounds is listed below.

The combined organic layers were dried over CaCl2 for 2 h. After filtration, the volatiles from the solution containing E were removed in vacuo to yield a cloudy coloured liquid.

31

as light yellow coloured solids according to the general condensation reactions outlined in Scheme 4.4.1.1.

Scheme 4.4.1.1: General preparative routes to model tin trimers used in this study. Characteristic of these trimers is the appearance of two, well separated (Figure 4.4.1.4), resonances in the
119

Sn NMR spectroscopy with one corresponding to the internal tin and one to

the two terminal tin centers. In most instances, the internal tin resonance is found downfield relative to that of the two terminal Sn centers. Also representative of these trimers is the

appearance of complex coupling patterns around the central resonances consistent with the relative abundance of
117

Sn and

119

Sn species. Coupling assignments of 9-15 were based on the expected

modelled coupling intensities previously calculated in our group for the tin trimer bridged [3.3]ferrocenophane.47 Previous studies of the
1

J and

2

J Sn-Sn coupling constants for

oligostannanes correlate with the relative Sn-Sn bonding and non-bonding distances respectively. A smaller 1J coupling signifies a reduction -orbital character in the Sn-Sn bond bonds. The 1J coupling constants (Table 4.4.1.3) obtained for compounds 9-15 are consistent with previously published reports for related tristannanes. 11,33

Figure 4.4.1.4: 119Sn (C6D6) NMR spectrum of 10. 4.4.2 -Experimental UV-Vis and calculated TD-DFT data for Trimers 9-15 The experimental and calculated max data and absorptivity data for compounds 9-15 are found in Table 1 and Figure 4. All of the transitions are found in the UV with some tailing to the visible and are moderate to strongly absorbing. This is consistent with the reported first energy gap transition (-*) for other known organotin trimers.11 Experimentally, compounds 10 and 15 with internal aryl tin and external alkyl tin substituents are redshifted (50-60 nm) relative to the all alkyl substituents containing organotin trimers 9, 11 and 14. The calculated wavelengths are in

reasonable agreement with the experimental values, but there is substantial uncertainty in the wavelength estimates of the shoulder transitions below 280 nm. The calculated transition

34

wavelengths for compounds with aryl substituents (2,4,5,and 7) are all red-shifted relative to the compounds with alkyl substituents only.

Figure 4.4.2.1: UV-vis spectra of tristannanes 9-15 in THF. The UV-Vis spectra of the mixed aryl/alkyl tristannanes (10, 12, 13, 15) are dominated by strong -* transitions with weaker, lower energy -* transitions that shoulder or are hidden by these stronger absorbances. The MO diagrams of these molecules illustrate the impact of differing tin substituents on the character of the transitions. The DFT (HOMO) diagram for the ground state of the all-alkyl tristannane 9 (Figure 4.4.2.1) shows a clear bonding distribution of electron density along the Sn-Sn-Sn framework. The DFT (LUMO) diagram also shows the electron density centered on the tin framework; however, in this case the MO is antibonding at the Sn centers. In contrast, the DFT MO diagrams of 13 (Figure 4.4.2.2) are representative of mixed alkyl/aryl
35

tristannanes in this study and show that the center of electron density shifts between the HOMO (centered on the tin framework) and the LUMO (centered on the aryl rings).

Figure 4.4.2.3: Left: HOMO of 13, Right: LUMO of 13 (Isoelectric Constant: 0.02). 4.4.3-TD-DFT Treatment of Oligostannanes 16-19 As a comparison with the results obtained for trimers 9-15, electronic spectra were calculated with TD-DFT (Table 4.4.3.1) for geometrically-optimized structures of a series of tin oligomers prepared by DrÃ¤ger and Adams.34 Compounds 16-19 were thoroughly characterized by these authors using a variety of methods to probe structural (X-ray diffraction, 119Sn NMR spectroscopy) and electronic (UV-Vis spectroscopy) differences. In each case, X-ray structure data confirmed that oligomers 16-19 adopt a TP configuration. The central Sn-Sn bond lengthens with each additional tin center to > 5% (from 2.7 Ã to 2.966(3) Ã) when comparing the trimer 16 to the
36

hexamer 19. The bond lengthening also coincides with a gradual bond angle widening of the central Sn-Sn-Sn, increasing from 107Âº in 16 to 121Âº in 19. These dramatic structural changes were found to directly impact the HOMO/LUMO energy gap, resulting in a significant redshift of the * transition. Selected bond lengths and angles from calculated structures (DFT) and predicted absorption maxima (TD-DFT) (both at the LSDA/SDD level of theory) for oligomers 16-19 are compared to experimental results obtained by DrÃ¤ger41 in Table 4.4.3.1. The calculated structural results compare favourably with experimental data with a reasonably good match of bond lengths and bond angles41; the overestimate of Sn-Sn bond distances is characteristic of DFT structure predictions for bonds involving heavy atoms. DFT successfully predicts the lengthening of the central Sn-Sn bond(s) and the flattening of the central Sn-Sn-Sn angle. Relative differences of the central Sn bond(s) were found to lengthen by 0.04 Ã exp. (0.05 Ã calc.) from 17-18 and by 0.06 Ã exp. (0.06 Ã calc.) from 18Â­19. A molecular representation for the calculated HOMO of

oligostannane 11 (Figure 4.4.3.2a) shows clear -conjugation along the backbone of the oligomer with good overlap between tin atoms, whereas the LUMO (Figure 4.4.3.2b) show the expected non-bonding interactions with no overlap between tin atoms and electron density centered on the nodes of the individual tin centers. The overestimate in the calculated absorption maxima compared with experimental maxima is consistent with the tendency of DFT methods to overestimate heavy metal bond lengths (vide supra). The magnitude of the red-shifts in absorption maxima are, however, accurately predicted: (16:17 28 nm [calc. 27 nm], 17:18 33 nm [calc. 31 nm], 18:19 35 nm [calc. 34 nm]). Inclusion of a solvation model (CHCl3 or THF) in the TD-DFT calculations of compounds 16-19 was found to negligibly impact the calculated data (Table 4.4.3.1). It should be noted that our calculations are for the TP geometries found in the solid state. In solution, the oligostannanes may adopt a range of conformations with some degree of GH geometry in their backbone. This would raise the energy of the HUMO:LUMO gap and could
37

partially account for the substantial redshift of the absorption maxima (~ 45 nm) from experimental to calculated results.

4.4.4- TD-DFT treatment of Oligomeric Stannanes Sita strategically prepared a series of oligostannanes 20a-m (EtOCH2CH2[(n-Bu)2Sn]nCH2CH2OEt where n = 3-15) from the stepwise insertion of a reactive stannylene species into the backbone of the growing oligomer, followed by a further reaction of the hydride terminated oligomeric stannane with a tin amide to cap the chain with terminal alkoxy group.52 The sequential chain extended materials were further purified by the HPLC separation of the linear oligomeric stannanes from cyclic tin materials. Sita's semi-empirical Sandorfy:Huckel treatment of oligostannanes 20b-m was in excellent correlation with experimental data when the ratio of the resonance integrals for geminal and vicinal Sn sp3 orbitals was set to 0.75, implying that 75% of Sn-Sn interactions were delocalized in nature. The model failed for the smallest oligomer, the tristannane 20a, presumably due to "end-group" effects.52 Some orbital overlap occurs between terminal Sn atoms and adjacent ligand carbon atoms, but the Sandorfy:Huckel model only considers overlap of hybrid Sn orbitals and does not specifically account for differences in Sn backbone substituents. The impact of this is most significant for shorter oligostannanes, particularly tristannanes in which the end groups constitute 2/3rds of the molecule. In this work, an evaluation of oligostannanes 20a-m by TD-DFT at the SDD/LSDA level also show a similar strong correlation of decreasing energy gap with increasing oligomer length (Figure 4.4.4.1). The TD-DFT calculated data shows a strong correlation with experimental data for the smallest oligomers (3 to 6 Sn centers, 20a-d) but shows significant deviation at longer oligomer lengths. Unlike the case for DrÃ¤ger oligomers, the calculated Sn-Sn central bond lengths in the oligomers 20a-m remained essentially unchanged at ~2.86 Ã regardless of oligomer length. Modelling oligomers with 7-15 tin centers in an all TP configuration indicate that the HOMO to LUMO energy gap continues to narrow with values even lower than the experimental determined value of polymer 21 (max = 380 nm). This might suggest that the longest uninterrupted TP segments in solutions of 21, and thus the average length of the fully conjugated chromophore, may only reach

6-8 repeat units. This is supported in part by a UV-visible study by Tilley et al.32 of a solid state film of H-[(n-hex)2Sn]n-H which was shown to possess a longer max absorbance (398 nm) than that observed in solution (384 nm), indicating that -conjugation is potentially not fully optimized in either sample.6 The differences in the calculated TD-DFT energy gaps of the TP oligostannanes 20e-m compared to their experimentally determined values is likely a result of the non-optimal geometry afforded oligomers (and polymers) in solution, and to a lesser extent in non-annealed solid state films. The success of the simpler semi-empirical Sandorfy:Huckel model relative to the DFT calculations may derive from the treatment of the resonance integral ratio as an adjustable parameter, thus intrinsically correcting for contributions of solution state conformers with conjugated TP segments shorter than the lengths of the oligomers. In contrast, the DFT

calculations are for all TP configurations, an assumption that becomes increasingly unrealistic for longer oligomers in solution.

Figure 4.4.4.1: Comparison of experimental and calculated first band gap energies for oligostannanes 20a-m. 4.4.5- TD-DFT treatment of Group 14 metallanes An early DFT treatment (low density functional, LDF) of the parent polymetallanes (H[MH2]nH , M = Si, Ge, Sn: 22-24) by Takeda and Shirashi was used to investigate their electronic structures and their first band gap energies. These are listed in Table 4.4.5.2 for two possible geometries; TP where a maximum orbital overlap of neighbouring Sn 5sp3 occurs as well as a GH geometry where orbital overlap is greatly reduced. We revisited this analysis using TD-DFT, primarily to attempt to validate the hypothesis that the band gap of polystannanes could be tailored with the addition of aryl substituents to approach a "molecular metal" state. A comparison of the energy gap data calculated by LDA vs TD-DFT is remarkably consistent, with some differences (Figure 4.4.5.1).
41

The calculated first excited state energy by TD-DFT is slightly lower for the TP form regardless of type of polymetallane when compared to the LDA method. A larger discrepancy is observed for the GH structure of the polystannane, where a smaller energy gap is calculated. Very recently, a DFT treatment of the hypothetical polygermane 23 with the PerdewÂ­BurkeÂ­Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation by Fa and Zeng yielded a first band gap energy of 3.03 eV.74 When the hydrogens attached to Ge were replaced with two aryl substituents, a lower direct band gap 2.2 eV, and an intrinsic, highly semi-conducting state, is predicted.

4.4.6 -TD-DFT Asymmetrical Polystannanes

Figure 4.4.6.1: Model oligostannanes and alternating polystannanes. Building from the experimental and calculated data obtained for the tin trimers, a series of asymmetrical oligostannanes 24-26 (Figure 4.4.6.1) were likewise subjected to TD-DFT. The length of the oligostannane was limited to seven tin atoms, with triphenylstannane caps at each end. The calculated energies of these 24-26 were compared to the electronic properties (UV-vis) of their parent polymers, 6-8 that were recently prepared by polycondensation reactions. These data are presented in Table 4.4.6.2. In all cases, an optimized TP orientation of the polymer chain was assumed. This "ideal" geometry may account for the smaller calculated band gaps of polymers containing aryl substituents, compared to their experimental values. By comparison, the calculated first band gap energies for the all alkyl containing polystannane, 8, is nearly identical to reported values.

Table 4.4.6.2: Experimental and theoretical max values for model oligostannanes and polystannanes. 4.5- Conclusions A series of model linear tristannanes containing mixed aryl and alkyl substituents has been prepared and characterized. DFT modelling at the LDSA level has provided useful estimations of structural and electronic data, and support for the concept of tuning electronic properties by substituent alternation in extended oligomeric and polymeric systems. Although overall accuracy of the predictions of the max of the -* transitions is fair, the general trends are correct, suggesting a future role for these calculations when designing novel polymeric systems. For structurally homologous series of oligomers, the tool accurately predicts the expected changes in the max of the -* transitions. The method also reasonably accounts for structurally changes imposed by larger and bulky ligands and correlates well with structural data provide by DrÃ¤ger. Recalculation of work previously modelled by Sita for a series of dialkyl oligostannanes also accurately reproduced the trends in terms of relative electronic transitions, particularly at the smallest oligomer sizes. The model is less successful in accounting for the aryl contributions of
45

phenyl rings attached to Sn atoms, which predicts a greater delocalization than what is observed experimentally. Further development of density functionals for heavy elements, larger basis sets and improved calculation efficiencies will likely more precisely account for these differences. 4.6- Acknowledgements: The authors are grateful for support from the NSERC Discovery Program.

Chapter 5- Conclusion and Future Outlook
This thesis provides the first in-depth look at the synthesis and characterization of fully tunable alternating polystannanes. This versatile chemistry opens the door to a variety of group 14 polymers that were previously unachievable. The condensation nature of the polymerization allows for large substituents on tin to be placed beside smaller ones on neighbouring tins rendering what were previously insoluble polymers, soluble. This work also encompasses the first substantial comprehensive computational study on polystannanes. This permitted the work on the bench to be justified prior to carrying out experiments/work, which may save time and resources. One possible area of continued research in the area of alternating stannanes is to introduce a light absorbing dye molecule to these polymers. These polymers are susceptible to photodegradation; at approximately a wavelength of ~400 nm. A logical approach would be to use a red-orange dye that can act as a light sink; potentially protecting the backbone from exposure to these light conditions. Some examples of dyes that can be used are Cascade blue, Pacific Blue, methoxycoumarine or even an Anisole-BODIPY as all of these dyes have excitation windows which overlap with the susceptibility region of polystannanes. Also these systems can act a nucleophilic deterrent as they may prevent the attack and addition to the tin center by providing large amounts of steric bulk by the presence of large aromatic ring systems. Figure 5.1 shows a possible moiety to which these polymers can be achieved.

Figure 5.1: Possible Dye Based Polystannane Moiety One possibility is that alternating polystannanes systems can be used in a dynamic involving a push-pull system. These systems will allow for the shuttling of electron density through the sigma bond connecting the tin centers, addressing some of the problems associated with the diffuse Sn-Sn bond and ultimately stabilizing it. These push-pull systems moieties such as Figure 5.3 have an electron donor or acceptor at the para position which, through -conjugation and - conjugation, allows communication between the centers. The CF3 groups are acting as a withdrawing substituent on the end group molecules, while the electron density is being forced from the MeO group on the para phenyl ring. Figure 5.2 shows the HOMO-LUMO diagram of this dynamic. It is observed that in the HOMO the electron density is shifted along sp3 hybrid axis.

Figure 5.2: HOMO (Left) LUMO (Right) of Theorized Push-Pull System.

48

Finally the possibility to introduce another element into the backbone is now achievable. Group 14 elements are all very similar in their characteristics and the insertion of another element could make the polymer still conductive and possess added stability. An example of this is the insertion of a silicon atom between the tin atoms. It will still be conductive however the tin to silane bond is substantially stronger then the polystannane bond making the theorized structure less chemically susceptible. All of the above projects have begun in the lab and are an ongoing process and a direct result of the possibilities and outcome of this work.

6.1-Alternating Polystannanes: Syntheses and Properties 6.1.1- Materials and Methods All reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Solvents were dried using an MBraun solvent drying system. All glass-ware was first dried in an oven then flame dried to remove surface moisture. 1H NMR (400 MHz), 13C NMR (100.6 MHz) and 119Sn NMR (149.2 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a BBFO 5-mm direct probe. A 1H pulse width of 30Â° was used, acquiring a spectral window of 8223 Hz (20 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 1s, acquisition time 3.98s, 32k points (16 scans). The 1H 90Â° pulse width was 10.4 Âµs. A 13C pulse width of 30Â° was used, acquiring a spectral window of 24038 Hz (239 ppm) using a relaxation delay of 2s, acquisition time 1.36s, 32k points (4096 scans). The 13C 90Âº pulse width was 8.7 Âµs. A

Sn was referenced to SnMe4 as an internal standard. All J

coupling values are reported as absolute values. UV-Vis evaluations were carried out using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UV-Vis spectrometer. Elemental Analysis was performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. of Norcross Georgia. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the AIMS Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Toronto using a JMS-T1000LC mass spectrometer (JEOL Inc., Peabody, MA) equipped with a Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) ionization source (DART-SVP, Ionsense Inc., Saugus, MA). The DART source was operated with He gas and the temperature was adjusted in the range 100-400C. Isotopic distributions for the observed ionic species were calculated using the Mass Center utility (JEOL) and were in good
50

agreement with the measured mass spectra. The DSC of polymers from this study were analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Pyris Diamond differential scanning calorimeter. Molecular weight determinations of polymer samples were made by GPC using a Viscotek TDAmax with THF as the elution solvent attached to a triple detector array (TDA 302). All reactions took place under nitrogen (N2) atmosphere or in a sealed Schlenk flask placed under reduced pressure (closed) or finally in a Schlenk flask exposed to dynamic reduced pressure (open). Pressures measured in mmHg using a mercury manometer attached to the Schlenk line.

6.1.2. - Elemental Analysis The elemental analysis was conducted by Atlantic Microlabs and was only examined for C and H. These elements account for less than half of the molecular weight of one unit within the polymer chain. As a result the uncertainty of these polymers is relatively high. The process itself has an uncertainty of Â±0.3% which can skew values significantly when coupled with a relative weight of tin used for calculations. Lastly the PDI of these polymers is slightly > 2, which is the value for an ideal condensation polymerization. With all of these factors in mind we used GPC to determine a rough EA calculation. Since the PDI is not a perfectly symmetrical bell curve the idealized monomer size is not exactly representative of the equally distributed polymeric chain. Assuming all of these factors we can determine approximately the number of repeat units is as follows: 5 = 77 units, 6 = 74 units, 7 = 1150 units and 8 = 180 units. As observed by all of these repeat unit sizes we can determine that end group affects are negligible due to the number of units in the chain. From then each like atom in the chain (all Sn, all C and all H) was added together to determine their total mass contribution to the polymer. Then each was added together and the individual atoms had a % determination based off of the total polymeric weight. The collective

elemental data is presented and used for calculated values. Importantly, at a 10% deviation of the starting material ratios from 1.0 cause a pronounced decrease in molar mass is expected for a polycondensation type reaction of the in situ formed stannides, according to Carothers equation.33 The deviation takes into account a non-idealized situation where as the calculations are assumed under an ideal working situation.

We estimated the molecular weights of alternating polymers by using the calculated dn/dc for homopolymer 5. This estimation allowed for a calculation of polymer PDI. While the dn/dc for different for each of the alternating polymers is different, an estimation using the more similar identical polystannane 5 is likely to be closer to the actual molecular weight compared to conventional systems calibrated with polystyrene standards.

High molecular weight polystannanes 6 and 7 containing alternating alkyl (n-Bu, or Me) and Ph substituents attached to tin centers in the backbone display ready solubility (> 20 mg/mL) in common organic solvents (DCM, toluene, THF, C6H6). This is in contrast to an earlier report of poly (diphenylstannane) which is effectively insoluble in organic solvents even at low molecular weights (~7,000 Da). See V. Lu and T. D.

The hydrostannolysis reaction leading to the formation of a Sn-Sn bond from the reaction of tin hydrides with tin amides was first described and the kinetics and mechanism investigated in detail by H. M. J. C. Creamers, F. Verbeek and J. G. Noltes, J. Organomet. Chem. 1967, 8, 469-477 who proposed the reaction proceeds by an electrophilic hydrostannolysis of the tin(IV)-amide bond from the reaction with tin(IV) hydride. They also conclusively ruled out a radical mechanism by carrying out reactions in the presence of radical traps in which no radical products were observed. The authors of this study suggest the formation of the Sn-Sn bond proceeds by either an SE2 (solvent assisted) or SF2 (four center) mechanism. 38.
