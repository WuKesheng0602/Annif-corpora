Thesis Abstract
The concept of Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes (CPUL) was introduced by Andrè Vilijoen and Katrin Bohn in 2004. This thesis project tests the application of the CPUL concept to Toronto, a densely developed North America winter city. It examines: 1. The challenges, limitations and opportunities of an existing high-rise city fabric as a platform for creating new coherent, continuous and active pedestrianized landscapes by reclaiming unused and under-utilized spaces. 2. The implications of merging reclaimed spaces with existing circulation arteries and infrastructure, to improve, invigorate and strengthen connections in the city. Through an iterative research and design exercise, which discovered many hidden potentials within the CPUL framework, this project is able to demonstrate how a linear park system is capable of seamlessly reconnecting a severed Toronto's waterfront to the dense downtown core. Such projects can substantially benefit community life, and offer new and meaningful forms of urban connectivity that are sustainable and productive.

introduction

Our Changing Relationship with Food The continuous growth of the human population is leading to an increased demand for food production. This surge in population has also led to the expansion of cities; increasing their demands for living, working and recreational amenities. We no longer migrate from place to place in groups in search for arable lands to farm and grow our own food. Instead we rely on transportation technologies to deliver food to us from anywhere in the world. Today we do not need to leave the comfort of our homes to travel to the local market to purchase groceries. Type in the keywords "Grocery Delivery" into Google search engine and you will find dozens of grocery delivery services. Real Food Toronto, Grocery Gateway and Online Grocery are only a few of the many grocery delivery services in Canada. The online services allow you to send your grocery shopping list through the Internet and have it delivered right to your doorstep.
Did you know that the average Torontonian spends 395 minutes driving to and from work every week? Add to that an additional 126 minutes per week traveling to a grocery store, shuffling through the massive aisles, waiting in line, loading up, driving home and unloading?! We believe you deserve to enjoy real food. We also believe that offering the best service to deliver the best product to your front door is a step forward.

Take back your time. Get real. 1

It's not difficult to see how and why such services are becoming more common. The world in which we live in is becoming more complex with each passing day. Inevitably, it seems, that we are less and less engaged with the very basic and fundamental need for the food we need to live our complex lives. We are simply too busy to think about it and food is always just a few mouse clicks away. We no longer really know, or care to know, where our food comes from and how it is grown. We know even less about the process food goes through before it ever makes its way to our dinner tables at home or in a restaurant. Freshness and tastiness may be qualities advertised at grocery stores, but in reality they are a thing of the past. Most of the produce we purchase today isn't fresh at all. Some products travel thousands of miles before they make it to the shelves in our local grocery stores. In order to prevent these products from decomposing and maintain their initial fresh appearance, food processing companies must rely on refrigeration and processing. Frozen and chemically treated and stored for weeks on end, they finally make their way to our local supermarkets where they are labeled as `Fresh' 2. However, information about health and nutrition facts are becoming more publicly accessible. Articles, books and research results have all raised the public awareness

about daily diets. Restaurants and eateries are required to disclose key nutrition facts about the food they sell their customers as more and more Torontonians choose to eat outside of their homes in food environments.3 What we eat and how much we eat affects our health and by extension our social life, our community and our city as a whole. Healthier eating habits and lifestyles reduces strains on the government's heath system. Healthier lifestyles invigorate individuals and drives them to seek for opportunities in which they can engage in with other people in their community. Food Production Today The process of food production is a delicate one. Some fruits, vegetables and grains only grow in specific climates. The land on which they grow is exposed to the elements, insects and pests. Serious outbreaks that disturb the growth of the fruits and/or vegetables can have serious repercussions for the farmer and the economy that is attached to the specific produce.* Climate 97% of climate scientists agree the earth's average temperature is warming and that the phenomenon is most likely to be directly related to human activities.5 What we see currently is the

unpredictable nature of our weather system and what NASA refers to as `extreme events' listed as one of ten indisputable signs of climate change.6 Reduction in local pollutants and loss of natural habitat, increase in forestation and green space are among climate change mitigation strategies in urban areas. The phenomenon of global warming has shifted the perspectives of architects, engineers, governments and many other organizations on the way in which we build the world around us. Alternative energy sources such as windmills and nuclear energy have long been integrated into our infrastructure. Meanwhile the top of homes are being resurfaced with solar technologies. Architects integrate solar panels and smart materials such as electrochromic technologies in a variety of ways to minimize heat gain. Car manufactures such as BMW, Tesla, Toyota, Nissan and Mercedes Benz produce road vehicles that run either on electricity or have extremely high gas mileage or a hybrid of the two technologies. As of January 31, 2010 the City of Toronto Green Roof Zoning Bylaw required the rooftop of buildings with a minimum gross floor area of 2000 square meters to green a certain percentage of their overall surface, depending on the height of the building and size of the footprint, as a way to manage water runoff from buildings.7 Food Security The changes that we are experiencing in our

* An example of this fact is the 2014 surge in the price of hazelnuts due to the cold winter in Turkey, a major hazelnut exporter to Germany and Italy. The price of hazelnuts nearly doubled from 6 Turkish lira ($2.75) per kilogram to 11 lira ($5.00). This price increase affected the Italian giant Ferrero which owns the Nutella brand. By extension, Nutella chocolate prices have gone up in every store that carries the product.4

INTRODUCTION

climate today are a direct result of the way we use energy to produce, transport and consume products. In order to contend with the increase in the population of cities and its demand for food, people need to be reconnected with the processes of food production through visible educational facilities. We have come to realize that the future of our natural resources may not be as secure as we had hoped it to be. There is little doubt that the depletion of our natural resources hold a grim future for our societies as we know them today.
Household food insecurity, inadequate or insecure access to food because of financial constraints, is a significant social and health problem in Canada. In 2012, 4 million individuals in Canada, including 1.15 million children, experienced some level of food insecurity. This represents nearly 13% of Canadian households." 8 "... The lowest rates of food insecurity were found in Alberta and Ontario, but even in these provinces, the rate of food insecurity was over 11%. 8

amounts of food to a large number of people. This shortage of food lead to public unrest and frustration with their governments. As the unrest grew governments were forced to react and reconsider the rationing strategies. The availability of food fluctuated and rationing continued until the end of the war. Post war studies revealed just how unfavorable the conditions were and how the coupon system failed to provide everyone with equal amounts of food as there were typically more coupons than rations.9 These examples made it evident that "victory gardens" (sometimes referred to as war gardens) are a viable solution for increasing food production in cities. Cuba began going through a food crisis of epic proportions in 1989. The fall of the Soviet Union lead to the loss of access to food and agricultural machinery and fuel in Cuba. As an oil driven country that received 12-13 million tons of oil from the Soviet Union, the shortage in fuel had severely affected its economy. The response to this crisis however is what later became one of the most inspiring events for the rest of the world. The government initiated a nationwide call to decentralize and restructure the conventional high input, large scale mono-culture system and convert it into small scale organic and semi-organic food production system. The new model used low cost and environmentally safe inputs and decreased the distance between the productive landscape to consumers, lowering the amount of fuel and

We can learn from past solutions to food insecurity. During World War II, the importing of food became extremely difficult for every country. The concept of rationing ­ where everyone should limit their consumption amount ­ therefore became almost every country's key strategy for limiting internal food consumption and distributing limited

energy consumption and cost associated with the transportation of food from its source to use point. Cuba became a world model that embodied core principals of urban agriculture. By 1994 some 8000 city farms were formed in Havana alone and by 1997 Cubans were eating almost as well as they were before the food crisis. It was estimated that by 1998 around 541,000 tons of food grown in Havana went to local consumption. Some neighborhoods were growing as much as 30% of their own food.10 The success of the urban food production model in Cuba took place while cities were becoming more dense and populated. 74% of the population of Cuba lived in cities by around 1996, nearly doubling the need for food during the crisis. Planning for Urban Agriculture Urban agriculture benefits city dwellers as well as its infrastructure. Direct benefits include creating a sense of community by bringing people together and the production of fresh local food. Visible urban agriculture projects also serve to educate and engage the residents of large cities and communities. Spaces dedicated to food production in the form of greenhouses and community gardens need to be made visible to the public, easily accessible and, more importantly, they need to

be an integral part of a design endeavor and be understood as such by the public. To enable this, urban agriculture must become an essential part of city planning. Urban agriculture activities and resources can be accommodated through design and policy initiatives. For example, gardens can rely on the water runoffs from buildings and roads for irrigation while taking advantage of direct and reflected sunlight from buildings. Population Growth and Urbanization Population growth is a worldwide phenomenon. The Earth's population is currently 7.2 billion and it is expected to reach almost 9 billion by the year 2050. At this time we will have to produce an extra 1 billion ton of cereal and 200 million tons of livestock every year to ensure food security.11 To make things more complicated, United Nations statistics suggest that urban areas will be expanding as more and more people move into urbanized areas.12 Cities with populations of 1 to 5 million in developed countries have seen an increase of 3.2% in population since 1970 taking the number of people that live in urban areas from 18.5 % to 21.7%. This trend is likely to continue for this class of cities to 21.9% by the year 2050. This is estimated to increase from 10.9% in 2011 to 13.1 % in 2050 for cities with populations of more than 10 million residents.12 The urban population in 2014 accounted for

INTRODUCTION

54% of the total global population, up from 34% in 1960, and continues to grow 13. Population growth of the city of Toronto increased by 4.5%, from 2,503,281 in 2006 to 2,615,060 in 2014 14. This increase in population needs an investment in infrastructure that is both sustainable and accommodating. As we know, a large portion of a city's growth is reliant on its transportation networks and walkability. Walkable cities create safe and pleasant environments for pedestrians and cyclists to move from one place in the city to another. Appendix A of the Toronto Official Plan includes a number of policies regarding walking strategies in the city. Densification is a cornerstone of North American urban development as a response to swelling populations. Optimum levels of density in cities like Toronto is still subject to further studies. The ideal level of density is dependent on many factors which include hard statistical analysis and the city's existing and future infrastructure Future Cities It is certain that cities need to plan to be more efficient in their use of natural resources, space and energy. Energy saving technologies are already integrated into the design of buildings. Growing environmental concerns have lead to not only the use of environmentally responsible methods and materials in our cities but also affect

the way urban planners and architects shape our cities in order to allow them to `breath.' However, in spite of what seems to be a small step in the right direction, cities still have many inefficiencies and produce a large amount of waste either directly or indirectly. Precious heat embedded in the HVAC exhaust systems of buildings are released into the air during cold winter days. Fruits and vegetables take weeks to be transported from across the world to finally make their way to the shelves in our supermarkets. Wide open left over lands sit passively and uneventfully in various parts of the city. Rainwater hits the hard impermeable surfaces we have created along streetscapes and drains into catch basins. Then the water is needlessly run through a filtration system to later be pumped and sent back to the same areas which it first came from and be supplied to a building's sanitary system or water the few plants around it. Sunlight heats up the rooftop of most buildings and the thermal heat escapes back into the air without being harvested to supply some of the electrical energy needed to light the interior spaces let alone preheat some of the building's hot water supply. Some people either need or just decide to drive a car equipped with four seats only to get them to work in mornings in spite of the morning and afternoon rush hour because of the inadequacy of the public transportation system in place.

Toronto Toronto is Canada's largest city and the fourth largest city in North America with a population of 2.8 million residents from diverse backgrounds.15 The Economist ranks Toronto 4th of the top ten most livable cities in the world. The livability index includes safety, healthcare, educational resources, infrastructure and environmental.16 There are over 18 different languages and dialects spoken across the city making it one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. Its diversity stretches to its entertainment industries and its food. Home to more than 9,000 restaurants - ranging from highend gourmet restaurants to home-based cooking - food is important in Toronto culturally as well as nutritionally. Toronto's population is increasing. The 2014 Ontario Population Projection report states that 52.9% of Canada's population will be living in the Greater Toronto Area by 2049 (47.6% in 2013). In 2012 there were more high rise buildings being constructed in Toronto than anywhere else in North America. A number of which were directly related to the high number of people migrating into the city from around the globe. The city also hosted the 2015 Pan American Games which attracted even more international tourists.17 However, the city faces many challenges. Vehicular traffic is becoming increasingly heavier**. Trying

to get home using the subway can present its own set of challenges. Overcrowded platforms as well as delays due to either mechanical difficulties or passenger assistance alarms are quite common. Toronto's infrastructure is aging and is in need of very serious repair and expansion. Due to political and municipal disputes over Toronto's aging infrastructure, subway and street car lines typically remain in the planning phase. Toronto Waterfront Revitalization: Having realized the economic, social and environmental potential of the 2000 acre Toronto waterfront, the Waterfront revitalization project is currently under construction. This multi-billion dollar plan roughly divided up into three precincts: West Don Lands. East Bayfront and Portlands. Areas around Mimico, Port Union, and Union Station are prioritized projects.19 The development is set to integrate some key ingredients and successful urban planning strategies such as pedestrian friendliness, easily accessible public transit systems, compact growth systems , cycling routes and green spaces for pedestrians. The first of waterfront developments have already taken shape in the West Don Lands.

** "... in 2006, the annual cost of congestion to commuters in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area was already $3.3 billion. This cost comes from travel delays, increased impact to the environment, increased vehicle costs from travel delays, and increased chance of vehicle collisions" 18

INTRODUCTION

About this Design Proposal This thesis project aims to integrate principals of urban pedestrian connectivity and urban agriculture with existing and upcoming infrastructure in the city. Toronto's Transformation 1. Toronto has long been tackling the visual and physical barrier of the Gardiner Expressway and the severance of the city's waterfront from its downtown core. Toronto Waterfront, once an industrial strip has undergone an incredible transformation in the past decade and it continues to do so. 2. In 2010, the city of Toronto and Toronto Waterfront released a competition brief, calling a number of urban design and architecture firms for ideas to improve, remove or reconfigure the Gardiner Expressway East. 3. In addition, major stretches of Queens Quay have been revitalized. Waterfront revitalization projects include a series of park spaces such as the Music Garden and the HTO Park, and pedestrian sidewalk improvements such as the West 8 Wave decks. Such projects continue to shape the waterfront. Improved dedicated streetcar routes, tree-lined widened walkways and dedicated bicycle paths are key components of these developments.

This architectural thesis project aims to propose a design that provides a clear, recognizable, active, and socially and economically productive connection between the urban core and the waterfront to reclaim the unused space above the Gardiner Expressway and provide an experientially rich thoroughfare for pedestrians and cyclists to seamlessly connect the city to the waterfront. Clarity in the design is achieved through consistent use of geometries and materials, framed views of destinations and provision of amenities such as seating and sheltered areas for the people that pass through the space. Recognizable spaces: As a destination bridge, the design aims to create recognizable spaces that take on particular characteristics. Portions of the park are associated with productive landscapes, main pathways include sheltered areas for resting and meandering paths for leisure. Other event spaces such as open grassed landscapes, spaces dedicated to play and recreation for children and adults are placed along a central artery to engage people in an active space.

2.1 About this Project

This thesis project is an investigation of how the concept of CPULs can be adopted to dense urban contexts such as Toronto. It demonstrates a variety of ways in which pedestrianized connected green spaces and urban agriculture can be embraced as a strategy to create a series of seamless experiential thoroughfares that connect the city's downtown core to its waterfront. Here, definitions and benefits of green spaces, productivity, pedestrianization and urban agriculture are inspected, interpreted, reinterpreted and finally implemented in a single design proposal. The final design proposal presented in this document is an illustration of a single example of how CPULs can take on the form of linear parks that connect to major streets and create coherent, universally accessible, bicycle-friendly and visually engaging amenities. The Gardiner SkyPark This thesis project focuses on responding to current design challenges that embody concepts of future cities as: productivity, walkability, breathability, continuity and finally connectivity of urban landscapes. It predicts that the future urban fabric will be organic and adaptive in both form and function. People will be the focal point of our future urban fabric and not cars. A model that embraces the spirit of this perspective is that of a Continuous Productive

Urban Landscape (CPUL) This thesis tests the CPUL concept in an existing urban condition of Toronto. An aerial photograph of Toronto's core reveals few options for open landscapes that can be used for food production, or tree canopies or recreational space. However there most certainly are many bare rooftops and underutilized spaces. Buildings adjacent to the Gardiner expressway in particular posses a number of interesting opportunities that can be used to create a continuous and productive urban landscape - The Gardiner SkyPark. This design project can be seen as a part of a larger urban connectivity strategy. It aims to illustrate an example of designing a productive urban landscape that is a piece of infrastructure providing connectivity within the city of Toronto. It is important to realize that as a stand-alone piece of infrastructure, the project connects a small area. However, The significance of the project lies in the strategies used to architecturally maneuver through an existing dense context, taking advantage of elevational changes , incorporating controlled and aesthetically pleasant designated areas to community gardens and greenhouses while simultaneously making them more visible to the public. Aspects of this project can be repeated elsewhere. Unlike Toronto's PATH Bridge, the intention is to not

only create a corridor for people to move through but to create a meaningful and enjoyable outdoor experience to encourage a healthier lifestyle by developing a green infrastructure that provides opportunities to exercise, enjoy green spaces and connect and create communities through various forms of activities. The design of the Gardiner SkyPark does not aim to dedicate an entire landscape to community gardens and greenhouses for food production as it is not a meant to be viewed as a landscape solely dedicated to food production. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how community gardens and the process of food production on a small scale can architecturally be integrated in and on our existing future infrastructure through form and function. Allotment gardens and greenhouses produce fresh food locally. They also have less tangible but highly significant impacts on urban environments and people and are a step forward in the direction of creating resilient cities * by: Providing walking and biking paths in the city and thus reducing the carbon footprint of people trying to commute from one place to another, Creating a vibrant and active environment for people to come together, play, exercise and recreate Connecting neighborhoods and nodes in the

city (Rogers Center, HTO Park, Music Garden and Queens Quay Revitalization Projects along the waterfront which include widened sidewalks and dedicated bicycle routes lined with trees) as well as existing transit systems that run along major streets (Such as Queens Quay street cars running from east to west) Enabling communities living on the south side of the Gardiner and Lake Shore Boulevard to safely and seamlessly bypass the high-speed vehicular arteries by foot or bicycle Integrating a natural environment and green space into a hard surfaced urban environment by taking advantage of the existing resources such as water runoffs from the Gardiner Expressway for the irrigation and sustenance of the parks vegetated landscape and community garden, providing permeable surfaces that reduce water run offs and finally taking advantage of the open airspace over the Gardiner expressway that currently serves no particular purpose. Providing an opportunity for residents of the surrounding community to grow some of their own food in their immediate surroundings and to bring people together at the same time.

use of available space - such as open lots and rooftops - as opposed to requiring a tabula rasa or a clean slate platform. As defined by Katrin Bohn and Andrè Vilijoen in the CPULs book: "Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes will be open landscapes productive in economical and sociological and environmental terms. They will be placed within an urban-scale landscape concept offering the host city a variety of lifestyle advantages and few, if any, unsustainable drawbacks."1
Fig.2.1: CPUL Concept applied to the Town of Middlesbrough, England

What are Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes? Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes (CPUL's) are a concept introduced by Katrin Bohn and Andre Viljoen inn 2004. CPULs are a combination of Productive Urban Landscapes and Continuous Landscapes. The concept can be described as a series of green open landscapes that are economically, socially, and culturally productive by design and are connected by a central carfree artery that allows people to seamlessly flow through while engaging them in a variety of different activities. CPUL's include open spaces dedicated to food production as well as parks and other green spaces. They are based on adaptive

They typically contain a variety of different planned and designed spaces that are connected by a pedestrian and/or bicycle friendly central artery or spine and are placed within an urban landscape and incorporate natural elements. CPULs, as described by Andrè Vilijoen and Katrin Bohn, are: · Coherently planned and designed combination of continuous landscapes and productive urban landscape · Open Urban landscapes · Productive in economical, socio-cultural and environmental terms · Placed within an urban scale landscape strategy · Constructed to create living and natural

elements · Designed to encourage and allow urban dwellers to observe activities and processes traditionally associated with the countryside, therefore reestablishing the a relationship between life and the processes required to support it. 1 By continually running through the city, CPULs connect various existing open spaces around the city providing an artery for people to flow through while creating a park-like experience. They will be walking landscapes that are topographical, incorporating nature and well-connected axes of movement and journey with places for reflection, cultural and social gatherings and containers for activities that occur outside CPULs are not based on a clean slate or the tearing down of existing urban fabric, but strategically mold and adapt to it, taking advantage of existing open spaces, connecting them and reclaiming a variety of available underused and/or unused spaces such as open flat rooftops, space over/under roads and highways and open lots. CPULs take advantage of the opportunities created by existing conditions, from vacant lots to reflected sunlight, water runoff, wind produced from vehicles. Therefore, by fusing into existing contexts, CPULs will advance the existing infrastructure. Plants and vegetation can use water runoffs from streets and highways for irrigation, soft permeable surfaces

will reduce water runoffs which in turn reduces the load on the city storm water management system. Vegetation and trees within the CPUL not only improve the air quality but also the aesthetics of the city streets and parks. CPULs are car free and prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, separating their flow from vehicular traffic and thus minimizing risk of accidents between people and vehicles, reduce the air and noise pollution in walking spaces, and create a natural refuge for city dwellers and small wildlife. By doing so, Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes encourage a healthier, safer and cleaner mode of commuting around the city. While individual amenities such as parks and recreational spaces, community gardens provide opportunities for communities in their immediate and peripheral surroundings; they do little to draw and connect communities with one another. Connecting Communities with urban spaces is important. Effective urban connections draw life to the streets and outdoors, provide economical, social and cultural opportunities for the city, and give people a platform to interact with one another in a public realm. By doing so, people not only identify themselves more with their individual communities, but will do so with their city as a whole. The city becomes an extension of the home and its image more identifiable and cared for by

those that live in it. Continuity has numerous benefits, some of which include: · Formation of dynamic ecosystems (wildlife corridors) that will develop over time and help the natural environment to sustain itself, · Efficiency in the flow and sharing of resources such as water and nutrients required by the natural elements · Seamless connection between existing natural elements and green infrastructure, · Free of cars, CPULs are designed for pedestrians and cyclists Continuous Urban Landscapes: The concept of Continuous Landscapes has already been established in the form of linear park in various cities. They are planted continuous landscapes that run through cities making use of unused and/or under-utilized urban spaces. They are virtually car free and provide an alternate use of space within an urban context. Examples of linear parks include New York's Highline and Paris's Promenade Plantee are such examples. The New York Highline is a walkway built along an elevated decommissioned rail line. It provides New Yorkers with a long stretch of vegetated landscapes that offer a refuge for pedestrians from the busy vehicle dominated streets (Case Study 9.17). Situated in

Paris, Promenade Plantee is another example of a linear park. Constructed along the Vincennes railway line that was abandoned after the new RER train line was constructed in 1969, like the Highline, Promenade Plantee offers pedestrians a refuge from vehicular traffic. Locals use the park on a daily basis and take advantage of the direct uninterrupted route to Bastille without having to engage with the vehicular traffic below. The route attracts joggers, tourists and workers in its vicinity that break there for lunch. (Case Study 9.12) Productive Urban Landscape "Productive urban landscape are defined as: open urban space planted and managed in such a way as to be environmentally and economically productive, for example, providing food from urban agriculture, pollution absorption, the cooling effect of trees or increased biodiversity from wildlife corridors." 1 The term productive within the CPUL concept includes (but is not limited to) concepts of urban agriculture and food production. Vegetation and trees provide cities with more than just aesthetic qualities. They can purify the air, reducing air pollution which contributes to lowering health care costs of citizens, They make use of storm water runoffs that otherwise flow directly into the city's storm water systems which in turn demand

more energy intensive management, and provide shelter and habitat for small wildlife that provide opportunities for biodiversity within an urban context. . Productivity can be broadly interpreted to include mental health and functioning in a workplace. Studies show that people living near trees and parks tend to live happier and healthier lives which can translate into greater productivity. Parks and easily accessible public recreational spaces are invaluable amenities. Their total worth is very difficult to measure. However, Spanish researchers found that ... each degree of increase in surrounding greenness led to a 5% improvement in the development of short-term, or working, memory over a period of one year. It also improved the progress of "superior working memory" ­ the ability to update memories with changing information ­ by 6%, and reduced inattentiveness. Computer analysis suggested that carbon from traffic fumes might account for up to 65% of the trend. 2 They are enablers and empower people and give them a sense of ownership over the space and their city. They change the image of the city and how it is perceived by its citizens and global communities.

Terms such as urban resiliency and sustainability, food production, self sufficiency and efficiency that once existed as mere concepts are today at the forefront of urban and architectural design. This includes strategies to tackle challenges of climate change, food security and resource management. It is important to look at more integrated visions. Integration and adaptation are the foundations for the construction of future cities. David Suzuki noted: "80% of us now live in an urban setting, and I think that the solution to our environmental problems is not to say `we've got to break down cities and get everybody back to the land' ­ that would be disastrous ­ but we have to make cities our major habitat...we have to make them more in balance, I think, with the rest of the things that keep us alive."3 Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes have three major components: 1. Green Spaces: Parks and open spaces covered with trees, plants and other forms of vegetation 2. Central Pedestrian Artery: A coherent car-free central artery dedicated to pedestrians and bicycles where possible. 3. Urban Agriculture: Open spaces in form of community gardens and community greenhouses dedicated to local food production and/or education.

2.2.2Components of CPULs

1. Green Spaces: Our climate is constantly changing. Temperatures in urban environments have been climbing as population in cities increase. · (a) recent study by Toronto's Environment and Energy Office suggesting that the number of days with temperatures reaching 30 degrees C or more will more than triple by 2049. 4 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines green spaces as: land that is partly or completely covered with grass, trees, shrubs, or other vegetation. Green space includes parks, community gardens, and cemeteries. Green spaces play an important role in the social, economic, cultural and environmental aspects of cities. Comprehensive integrated approach to the design of urban green spaces produce a number of qualitative and quantitative benefits for city dwellers and tourists and the environment. Green spaces have substantial environmental benefits. They: · Improve air quality by lowering carbon dioxide produced by vehicles and producing oxygen. Studies show that 2,500 square feet (just over 230 square meters) of turf absorbs carbon

dioxide from the atmosphere and releases enough oxygen for a family of four. One tree is able to remove 26lbs of carbon dioxide - the equivalent of 11,000 miles of a standard car emission. Lower heat island effects and temperature buildup that in turn reduces energy costs in buildings, Reduce storm water management costs by reducing storm water runoffs Create a passive filtration system that lowers the intensity of toxins entering the water system in the city, Trees can provide shade and create seating opportunities which leads to the creation of more pleasant streetscapes, Create wildlife corridor and increase biodiversity in the city 5

In addition to the environmental benefits, green spaces also have important social benefits in an urban environment. They: · Contribute to the mental health of people that live around them, · Help lower stress levels, plod pressure that is associated with stress, · Increase productivity in people that live and work around them, · Lower vandalism and crime and increase self esteem · Benefit children's health.

transportation systems as they provide people with the opportunity to walk or cycle around the city instead of driving or having to take public transportation. These in turn reduce congestion and air pollution. Densely developed urban areas contain smaller parcels of open spaces that can be allocated to green infrastructure. The City of Ottawa website contains detailed information about benefits and the importance of connected green spaces as strategies to pedestrianize, and increase efficiency within the city. A connected network of green spaces reduces the importance of the amount of open space at any specific location because it improves accessibility, reduces the need for additional land where it is difficult to provide, and adds to the sustainability of green space.8 Connections diminish the perceived and real sense of isolation. Connected parks and green spaces are also known to be more enjoyable and more frequently used by people. Fully pedestrianized/bicycle oriented connections are not feasible everywhere. Many roadway side walks can accommodate a variety of streetscaping elements such as trees and street furniture. The provision of a consistent language in streetscaping helps render an image of unity and continuity and place a city in a park. Studies have shown that streetscaping also create a way finding system for

Connected Green Spaces In an article published by the Toronto Star, Edward Keenan wrote that Parks cannot be planned as isolated green islands, within the city. Instead our parks should flow through our neighbourhoods and connect with each other through a variety of open spaces that serve different needs 7 An early North American example of this concept is Fredric Law Olmstead's Emerald Necklace in Boston. Creating a pedestrianized/pedestrian friendly network connected green spaces is as vital to a city as the connectivity of its

pedestrians as well drivers. Ecological functions are known to develop over time in connected urban green spaces. Links between green spaces provide wildlife corridors that allow small animals to move seamlessly from one space to the next. When systematically implemented, the infrastructure supporting the trees and other forms of vegetation can be unified to efficiently make use of available resources such as water runoffs for irrigation. Connectivity through natural linkages between natural areas maintains ecological functions such as biodiversity and wildlife habitat. Linkages provide passage for animals requiring a variety of habitats to complete their life cycle. Linkages provide for movement and reproductive interchange between populations of plant and animal species, and they buffer natural areas and processes from adjacent land uses. 8

2. Pedestrianized Central Artery Walking is not the fastest way for traveling from one point to another. It is however the most flexible mode of commuting. Walkers are not limited to roads and transit tracks. They can take a variety of different routes to arrive at their destinations. What is not matched in speed is compensated by the in the experience and engagement of people with their surroundings. Pedestrians are much more likely to interact with businesses and other people that drivers. Recent studies have shown that walking is in fact therapeutic and has physical as well as mental health benefits. It enhances physical fitness, aesthetic pleasures and creates opportunities for socializing and is relatively inexpensive. Pedestrians are the key component of activate public spaces. Pedestrianization Guidelines As urban population increases, pedestrianization is a key ingredient in the planning and adaptation process of our current and future cities. Pedestrianization reduces the need for cars which reduces air and noise pollution and instead increases the use of public transportation services such as street cars and buses. Wide sidewalks with trees attract more businesses and help the local economics of the city. A study of over 500 cities in Germany showed that enhancement of the quality of sidewalks attracts more visitors and

increases sales from 20-40%.9 Some successful pedestrianization guidelines were presented in a 2009 seminar, a case study of St. Catherine's Street in Montreal include the following strategies: · · · · · · · · · · Fine-grained street fabric Unified management committee Access to both public transit AND parking Critical mass of visitors Cleanliness Variety among businesses Food-related commerce Street width  15 m Segment length  4 km East-west street orientation

3. Urban Agriculture: Past, Present and Future Urban Agriculture has been embraced in recent years as an important strategy to increase access to local, fresh food, particularly for the food insecure. It is also seen as a part of a comprehensive sustainability agenda and a necessary strategy to cope with climate change, population growth and diminishing resources. 10 Advances in transportation technologies and the invention of refrigeration systems made it possible for cities to be able to transport food from far away places of the globe. While the idea of local food growth slowly dissipated from cities as they became more dense and industrialized, the concept of urban agriculture remained in visions of architects and designers. Of the most notable urban planning concepts is Ebenezer Howard's Garden Cities. Garden cities combined the town and the countryside and allocated spaces to farming and food production. The idea of urban food production is not new. During World Wars, kitchen gardens and allotments were used to supply troops and families with food.10 More recent examples can be seen in various forms of community gardens around the city of Toronto and other cities around the world. Rooftops,

open lots and landscapes have been dedicated to community food production that produce fresh local food. Community gardens like Alex Wilson Community Garden, Saint Jamestown Community garden are just a few community gardens situated around the downtown core of Toronto. Artscape Wychwood Barns is another community cultural hub that offers a platform for a range of cultural, artistic and agricultural activities on a site previously used for streetcar repair barns. Food production on a large scale in urban areas face many challenges, such as municipal policies, availability of arable and appropriate lands as

well as high real estate values. However, while production on a large scale may not be feasible or even possible. In most cities urban agriculture is a common practice in urban areas. Community gardens reconnect people with the concept of food production and provide locals with access to fresh local food. Food Literacy Knowledge about health and food production processes is increasing everyday. As a result people are becoming more concerned with the sources from which their food comes from and

prefer fresher and healthier choices. Transparency in the process of local food production in community gardens and urban greenhouses provides a platform for educating the public about healthy food, challenges of food production and processing. In addition, community gardens and greenhouses enable the production of crops that are otherwise unavailable locally. Social Benefits Food production is not the only benefit of urban agricultural practices. Studies have shown that urban gardens and greenhouses benefit the population by creating communities and engage individuals of different backgrounds and ages ad create a sense of ownership over the land fostering a sense of identity in the individuals. They provide opportunities for people living inside dense urban areas and residential high-rises to meet their neighbours while engaging in common activities. Other social benefits of community gardens include increased levels of eyes on the street, lower crime and safer neighborhoods. The emergence of food production as a commonly recognized activity within the urban context has started to transform urban agriculture from a theoretical concept with occasional, exceptional, experimental

manifestations to a common phenomenon. Urban food production has long existed in backyard and community gardens, but here we are referring to other situations that are more complex, multi-functional or are found in more unusual settings 10 Rooftop Gardens Flat rooftops are a common occurrence in densely packed urban settings and have incredible potential to be more than bare unused spaces within the city. They have long been used by occupants of the buildings for a variety of different purposes that include gatherings, food production, raising of small animals. MacRae (2010) have reached the preliminary conclusion that the City of Toronto has the current land and rooftop base within its own boundaries to produce 10% of the fresh vegetables currently consumed through the market system 11

2.2.3CPULs: Opportunities and Challenges

Challenges for CPUL Implementation Implementation of the concept of CPULs in densely developed urban contexts however poses many challenges. Lack of available space, high real estate values, presence of major vehicular arteries, municipal regulations and scattered urban green spaces are the predominant challenges that designers and urban planners are faced with in an effort to execute plans for CPULs in dense urban environments. Adapting the CPUL model to an intricate network of vehicular arteries and heavily developed land requires urban designers to deal with a variety of challenges such as negotiating existing roadways, property ownerships and linkages and/or transitions to nodes within the city. Additional challenges include compliance or negotiating municipal bylaws and regulations that limit and/or prohibit certain activities such as urban agriculture. CPULs rely on the availability of land and maneuvering strategies such as elevated and meandering walkways to allow people to move through its connected network of green space and productive landscapes. Furthermore, vehicular traffic arteries define the fabric of large high-rise cities; therefore achieving an entirely car-free path system is often not possible as high-rise cities are constructed around vehicle prioritized roads with limited sidewalk space. However, strategies such as addition of trees and street furniture between the road and

the walking space, lighting and markers (such as canopies, public art pieces, etc.) are often successful in creating identifiable spaces. Tree lines and identifiable architectural elements add visual coherence, clarity and serve as way finding systems and are able to create a sense of unification and continuity.

Challenges of Dense Urban Environments Cities are highly complex and dynamic clusters of development. In addition to their economic function, cities are where people meet and interact with one another in a variety of ways. Interaction between people and their communities and urban spaces enlivens urban spaces and fills them with activities that feed people's interest and need for social interactions. The pathway to the creation of vibrant environments that enable social interaction lies in the way a city is structured and its connections between different places within the city. Designers need to consider how people choose to go from one place to another, the levels of interaction between people and points of interest, experience, lifestyles, safety and the kinds of activities people engage in are all attributed qualities of how neighbourhoods and places within a city are connected to one another, and the kinds of platforms of opportunities they provide for the

25

FRAMEWORK

people that use them. As the population of cities grow however the demand on urban infrastructure increases. Green infrastructure such as open spaces and parks contribute to the health and sustainability of cities. However, as more large condominiums and office towers occupy open lots, the potential for greenery within the city diminishes.

How and why should CPULs be adapted to urban environments? More people are choosing to live in cities in order to be closer to their work environment and the abundance of the different activities that take place within the city core during different times of the year. As our population grows, so does the size of our cities and the demand on the infrastructure. The way we live and work in our cities is changing. Our relationship with the way we get our food, how we commute to places and ho we obtain energy has to shift and adapt with our ever growing population. Cities have the potential to enable a more efficient lifestyle where people live healthy, happy lives in their homes and communities. Researchers have found that the physical environment in which we live, contributes greatly to the way people live. It can form and transform lifestyles.12

As our cities grow, a variety of strategies have been implemented to accommodate growth. Tactics that promote urban agriculture, community building, pedestrianization, creation of bicycle friendly routes and green spaces have become more central to the way we shape and form our cities. Architects, urban planners and municipalities alike are all in pursuit of the implementation of architectural and urban planning interventions that will create more livable and dynamic cities that embrace concepts of sustainability and urban resilience. While the first model of a CPUL was introduced in London, England, the idea of CPULs have gained popularity in the realms of urban design and architecture as potentially viable strategies for tackling challenges of urban sustainability and resiliency, community, culture and food security. Examples of such projects can be seen in the most recent proposal of Washington åD.C.'s 11th Street Bridge Park by OMA+OLIN (see Case Study A.13) which stretches over the Anacostia River and the Green Spectator Bridge by KAMJZ (see Case Study A.18) as a series of bridges that include programs directed towards urban agriculture while providing a seamless landscaped crossing condition over a multi-lanes vehicular artery for pedestrians and cyclists. Given the scattered nature of green spaces and parks in a city like Toronto, finding a single route

26

to serve as a central artery may be difficult. Pedestrian and vehicular traffic vary depending on the location of nodes and various different types of activities that exist around the different areas of the city of Toronto.

FRAMEWORK

2.3 City of Toronto

The City of Toronto The city of Toronto is evolving. Urban design considerations for city officials, urban planners, architects and engineers are becoming more complex as we are learning to be more forward looking with every aspect of the way we choose to form our cities. Cities are becoming more complex and therefore fusing different disciplines of urban planning, architecture and engineering. Individual building blocks that make up a city must be regarded as components in an interconnected network that is organic in nature. Cities today must be flexible and resilient in the face of unpredictable events such as climate conditions and population increases. The design and development of every piece of land in cities must be done parasitically, efficiently taking advantage of every available resource. Future cities will have to look very different than what we see today if they are to display a meaningful level of resilience. Buildings will be more energy efficient, public transit lines will be more accessible, integrated and connected, streets will be more walkable and bicycle friendly, green spaces will be more connected and frequent allowing the city to breath, rooftops will be greened, various fruits and vegetables will be grown locally, cars will be quieter and more energy efficient. As designers we must pave the path to the development of our future cities.

Toronto as a Case Study The rate of construction of new infrastructure and provision of green spaces that contribute greatly to the well being and health of citizens in the city of Toronto is not sufficient to keep up with the increasing density and population. Open spaces that have the potential for greening are often built upon by private developers. While the population has increased, new residential towers are not built to foster a sense of community. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of availability of collective activities within an immediate area. It is important to recognize that dense urban areas have enormous potential to become successful and sustainable communities. Urban environments must be recognizable and designed in such a way as to allow people to live happy lives and improve their sense of belonging to places and not just buildings they happen to reside in. It is therefore important to implement a strategic platform of opportunities for interaction. Amenities such as parks and urban green spaces create opportunities; they provide a platform for engagement and a sense of empowerment over the space in which they live. Communities grow stronger and safer as people take ownership of the space in which they can live, play and work. Studies show that people living near green spaces tend to live happier, healthier and longer lives.2 The happier and healthier lives people lead, the more

productive they are in and outside of their work places. The term `productivity' reaches beyond the what appears to be immediately visible in monetary value or outcome. Studies show that people highly value the time they spend outdoors in parks and green spaces around the city. Studies also show that green spaces and vibrant streets capes are a key factor in attracting businesses and economic activities in their surrounding areas. 13 Toronto Streetscapes As a part of an effort to create safer more attractive streetscapes, the City of Toronto has created a streetscape manual that outlines possible design opportunities for improving sidewalks. These efforts, among with many other guidelines greater by various different bodies within the city of Toronto point indicate a movement towards a more pedestrian friendly, green and sustainable urban environment. Streetscape improvement such as addition of street furniture like benches and lighting fixtures along with tree lines strengthen connections by enhancing the qualitative experience of local and visiting pedestrians. Such improvements are not only aesthetically pleasant and but make streets and intersections more identifiable for both walkers and drivers. Trees provide shade for pedestrians during the summer time, reduce the amount of heat that is absorbed by the hard

surfaces, create buffer spaces between vehicular and pedestrian traffic and improve the air quality of the urban environment. The City of Toronto Streetscape manual identifies the Toronto waterfront - once an industrial area as a `scenic' artery. A number of waterfront revitalization projects have already been completed and accommodate pedestrians and bicycles. Queens Quay in particular has been fitted with wide pedestrian sidewalks lined with trees that create buffer spaces between pedestrians and vehicular lanes, include dedicated streetcar lines, bicycle lanes and 2 lanes of vehicular traffic. In spite of these efforts to create a more vibrant and continuous pedestrian oriented artery along the waterfront, Toronto's waterfront suffers from its severance from the downtown core of the city as a result of the Gardiner Expressway and Lake Shore Boulevard which are stacked arterial roads that run parallel to the lake front. Street treatments to improve the quality of space underneath the Gardiner Expressway are rarely sufficient or completely absent. Crossing the Lake Shore Boulevard is unsafe and unpleasant and at times confusing for pedestrians because of the position of pedestrian traffic lights and the on and off-ramps that merge down from Gardiner Expressway above.14

GARDINER SKYPARK

These issues are well recognized. Competitions such as 2010 Innovative Design Options For The Gardiner Expressway And Lake Shore Boulevard Reconfiguration have called upon various design firms for proposals that will create more fluid and seamless movement between the North and South side of the arterial roads. In the more recent years, a number of projects have been implemented however. Projects like the PATH pedestrian bridge provide a minimal solution for a safe crossing for people and are indicative of the challenge of crossing these vehicular roads. (Refer to Case Study 9.11)

However, more substantial, meaningful and multifunctional connections should be explored that will reclaim under-utilized passive space under and over the gardener expressway, and transform them from passive to active landscapes that are more experiential and transform the image of the city and the way it is perceived by locals and visitors. However, while such efforts are a step towards the right direction the central parts of the city, the Toronto waterfront still suffers from a severance from the downtown core that is caused by Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner

Expressway. Thus, a more meaningful, integrated and resilient model of connectivity should be sought and implemented to reconnect the Toronto waterfront to the Downtown Core of the city.

2.4 The Gardiner Expressway

The fundamental reason for the public debate about the future of the Gardiner Expressway is that it creates a barrier ­ perceived or real ­ between the downtown center and the waterfront. Although the walk from Toronto's bustling and beloved St. Lawrence Market to Jarvis Slip is just over a quarter-mile, the combined effects of passing beneath the railway berm, past the dizzying on- and off-ramps, across six lanes of high-speed Lake Shore Boulevard traffic, and below the noisy expressway make it a daunting challenge for even the most intrepid pedestrians. A vastly improved series of north-south connections ­ ones that are inviting to those walking, biking, roller blading, jogging, or driving to the waterfront from downtown ­ are critical to the success of any plan for the area, whether the Gardiner Expressway is retained, replaced, or removed.15 (2010 Competition To Develop Innovative Design Options For The Gardiner Expressway And Lake Shore Boulevard Reconfiguration)

2.2.1 The Gardiner Expressway: Brief Summary and Background Information

One of Toronto's major challenges is the physical separation between the city's downtown core and its waterfront caused by the elevated Gardiner Expressway and the Lake Shore Boulevard that runs below . The Gardiner is a major 6 lane vehicular expressway that runs approximately 18 km. This high-speed vehicular artery connects the Don Valley Parkway on the east end of the city to Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 427 on the west end. The elevated highway slices through the southern stretch of the Toronto downtown area.

Expressway may not be fit for use if repairs on the road surface aren't carried out in six years".16 The option of tearing the highway down is not a favored alternative to its repair in spite of it being the cheapest alternative. Although studies show that while the removal of the structure and

Fig.2.6: Aerial Photograph of Toronto (Bing Maps)

Some buildings seem to come within an arm's length of the edge of the highway as a result of intensified development of high rise buildings along this stretch of highway. This is a direct result of increased land values and the desire of developers to maximize the use of their properties for economic reasons. The eastern end of the Gardiner Expressway is in need of very serious structural repair. Exposed steel and falling pieces of structural concrete are not uncommon sights while passing under the highway. In 2012, a city staffing report announced that "The eastern portion of Toronto's Gardiner

reconfiguring Lake Shore Boulevard may benefit the city by visually connecting the waterfront, it would increase commute time for drivers by up to 30 minutes.12 While the Gardiner expressway has been recognized as being a visual barrier between the city and the waterfront, Lake Shore Boulevard truly finishes the job of dividing the waterfront from the city. The 6-lane Lake Shore Boulevard runs parallel and underneath the Gardiner Expressway between Don Road on the east end (situated at the southern foot of the Don Valley Expressway) and Dan Leckie Way a few kilometers west of the Toronto Downtown core. The stretch coincides with 34

the portion of Toronto waterfront that is currently being revitalized.

A new bridge designed by WZMH Architects situated above the Lake Shore Boulevard is one example of future pedestrian crossings . It is an

extension of Toronto's famous 30 kilometer PATH network that was previously terminated at the south end of The Air Canada Centre. The glass enclosed pedestrian bridge is placed underneath the Gardiner Expressway and spans across the width of Lake Shore Boulevard connecting The Air Canada Center to Sun Life Financial Tower & The Harbour Plaza Residences .With minimal vertical supports, the design allows for possible future reconfiguration of Lake Shore Boulevard. Negotiations with the city meant that the bridge placement also provides enough space for maintenance of the Gardiner Expressway's underside structure. The bridge is to move if the highway is torn down in the future.13

The major difference between Lake Shore Boulevard and the Gardiner is the difference in their elevation and the connections to other streets that perpendicularly intersect this stream while massive concrete piers of the Gardiner expressway border its edges. Large areas on either side of Lake Shore are left bare and covered with dust and dirt covered in footprints of people that most likely were trying to find their way to the nearest intersection to be able to cross the street or go back to the city. Crossing Lake Shore by foot is confusing, inconvenient and at times even dangerous. In some places the crossing involves not only Lake Shore but the on or offramp (sometimes both) to or from the Gardiner Expressway. This is a safety issue. A number of design strategies address the threat to pedestrian safety caused by Lake Shore Boulevard. 35

2.2.3Relationship To The Built Environment

Bare Flat Rooftops Some of the older mid to low-rise buildings adjacent to the expressway bare little to no notably immovable structures on their rooftops. These flat roofs can be greened with vegetation. Waterfront Revitalization The city of Toronto has been trying to find a number of ways in which to stitch the Toronto waterfront back to the rest of the city. The first of these efforts can be seen at the southern foot of Spadina Avenue with street cars that cross Lake Shore to connect to newly revitalized Queens Quay Boulevard (See Fig.2.14). The new, The PATH pedestrian bridge (See Case Study A.10) near Bay Street is another example of the city's effort to connect to the waterfront. Change in Elevation There is a gradual and yet notable change in elevation between the land at the north and south side of the Gardiner Expressway / Lake Shore Boulevard. Areas 100 meters north of the Boulevard are situated at elevations comparable to that of the height of the elevated expressway. Empty Lots and Underutilized Spaces Long and almost uninterrupted continuous stretches of bare and underutilized spaces can be found underneath the Gardiner and adjacent to Lake Shore. (See Fig. 2.13) As Lake Shore Boulevard runs underneath the

Gardiner Expressway, it is bordered by a row of massive concrete piers that support the structure above. The height of the Gardiner varies and estimated to be around 6 meters to the underside of the approximately 2 meter deep concrete

a mid to high rise structure as density increases. Other problems are associated with urban agriculture in a city like Toronto. One of which is cold winter temperatures making it impossible for crop to grow outside during half of the year.

Fig.3.1: A photograph taken from an elevated perspective of the city shows the high density of building blocks in the city.

Problems with CPUL's and Urban Agriculture If one were to take a close look at an aerial photograph of a densely developed city like Toronto, it is apparent that while it might be possible to connect green spaces, it is unlikely that many empty parcels of land could become productive urban farms. Not only are open spaces very limited and often small, but they are also very high value parcels, making it difficult to economically justify the use of empty parcels for agricultural purposes. It is not hard to imagine that every open space in the Toronto downtown area (that normally exists in a form of a surface parking lot) will be occupied by

*Lower density cities and neighborhoods, or shrinking cities (such as Detroit) can be ideal places for urban farms. Smaller Scale urban agriculture is more appropriate for high density areas.

If urban agriculture is to become a real component in a city like Toronto, it most likely has to take place in controlled and sometimes closed environments in the form of a greenhouse. Another problem with urban agriculture is aesthetics. Agriculture has traditionally been about efficiency and production and quality. Farms

are actually massive production machines that require specific equipment, waste management strategies, storage rooms, irrigation and generally hard physical labor and it can be an untidy business. It takes a considerable amount of effort to ensure the survival of a farm and maintaining or improving yield levels.

Fig.3.4: Vision of French architects of the interior of an urban vertical farm. This view demonstrates an intimate visual engagement between the occupants of a building and the growing spaces with controlled environments.

Fig.3.5: The Eden Project, located in St Blazey, Cornwall, UK provides an insulated and protected indoor space for vegetation to be able to grow throughout the year.

DEVELOPING A CPUL MODEL FOR TORONTO

Design Concepts While Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes typically make use of unused spaces and voids within an urban context, this thesis design exercise is an attempt to find ways in which existing building blocks, roads and underutilized surfaces can become the building blocks of a CPUL implemented in a dense urban context. The diagrams below abstractly display this concept. The round bubble-like forms represent productive and/or green landscapes. They come in all types

of forms really and can have any footprint of any size. They can either be close to the main spine of the CPUL, in which case they can connect t it directly, or be located further away from the spine. In the latter case a path that branches off can connect the space to the main spine. The spine provides continuity and flow between and through the entire stretch. Continuity is the cornerstone and most significant characteristic of the concept because it ensures connectivity to the rest of the urban environment and makes servicing the infrastructure more efficient for the city and private owner of individual pockets. The diagram to the right depicts a volumetric conception of the idea. Notice that every building block contains a volume that will become a part of the CPUL's stretch. These volumes can be placed anywhere along the buildings elevation so long as they maintain a direct or indirect link to the main spine. While these productive spaces are to be inserted into taller adjacent buildings and on to the rooftop of shorter structures, future buildings

will benefit from integrating such dedicated spaces into the design of the overall structures The challenge of connecting the two sides of the Gardiner may be addressed in a series of crossover bridges running in between the adjacent building blocks. They must then provide ways in which pedestrians can fluidly navigate their way down to the ground level.

3.2 Categorization of Building Types along the Gardiner Expressway
Aerial views of the city help categorize the various building forms and arrangement along the Gardiner Expressway. 5 categories have been identified that represent the typical built forms. Type A: Building Block on one side and Green Space on the other. Type B: Building Blocks on either side of the expressway with notable a difference in height. Type C: Tall Building Blocks on either side of the expressway with similar heights. Type D: Short to mid-rise Building Blocks on either side of the expressway with similar heights. (Heights comparable to that of the expressway)

3.3 Building Type Transformation Strategy

Using the different typologies and configurations, a transformation strategy was developed for the individual blocks, connecting them latitudinally

across the separating line of the Gardiner and longitudinally to each other to achieve continuity between the all the individual components.

Fig.3.9: Existing Building Types along the Gardiner Expressway

Phase 1 a. Insert of greenhouse and/or green space   into tall building blocks.

b. 

Place Greenhouse and/or green space  onto low to medium hight building blocks

Fig.3.10: Phase 1 of Building Types transformation along the Gardiner Expressway
GARDINER SKYPARK

54

Phase 2 a. Place a link in between building blocks on   opposite sides of the separation line

b.  

Develop a publicly accessible vertical  circulation strategy between street level  and the elevated green space

Fig.3.11: Phase 2 of Building Types transformation along the Gardiner Expressway

Phase 3 a. Develop a streetscaping dialogue between   existing and/or proposed pedestrian

pathways/sidewalks and the elevated green spaces

Site Selection Criteria The site selected for this project is the extension of Peter Street and partially placed along the north stretch of Blue Jays way. North of this site this artery has been severed from the ubiquitous urban street grid of Toronto and traffic is diverted to/from Spadina Avenue. To join the grid. Based on the pedestrian crossing volumes and current developments, the area displays a number of opportunities that make this site an attractive for this design proposal. · Developing neighborhood · No direct connection to Toronto Waterfront · Opportunities for improvements street and sidewalk

· Open surface parking lots are expected to develop which would further intensify population density · Access to major East-West arteries (Front St W, King St. W, Queen St. W, Adelaide St. W, Richmond St. W) · Opportunity to intensify retail and commercial activities to create a more active street · Opportunity to extend the street grid

· Available space for implementation of bicycle lanes · Direct access to Metro Toronto Convention Centre · Direct access to Rogers Center Stadium

Fig.4.19: Area underneath the Gardiner Expressway is left bare. Long stretches of these types of conditions are typical along the length of the elevated highway. Parts are fenced off and bordered by Lake Shore Boulevard.

Fig.4.20: Separation between on and off-ramps and Lake Shore boulevard are often substantially wide. The space can easily be vegetated and paved in order to create more attractive and usable conditions for people.

Fig.4.21: Storm water management system from the Gardiner Expressway drains water directly on to the ground underneath without any treatment or use where it often pools and muddies the soil

Fig.4.22: Off-ramp at Spadina Avenue slices the pedestrian sidewalk, forcing people to cross the offramp before being able to walk along the Spadina sidewalk. The image shows the vast areas of land underneath the Gardiner Expressway that provide plenty of opportunities for streetscaping.

Fig.4.24: Caledonia sail ship is docked next to the HTO Park and attracts the attention of many park goers and visitors. The ship remains at this location for the majority of the year and sails to a different location during the wintertime. It is a major attraction during Toronto's Tall Ship Festival which takes place every summer along the Toronto waterfront.

Fig.4.25,26,27: Pedestrian sidewalk bordering the southern edge of Lake Shore Boulevard is currently left without any form of street treatment. the width of the sidewalk is substantial and can easily accommodate bicycle lanes and pedestrian walkways that can be separated by tree lines. (See Diagrammatic Design Section 2)

Fig.4.28: Newly finished Queens Quay Streetscape, part of Toronto's Waterfront Revitalization projects. Queens Quay has been fitted with 2 lanes of vehicular traffic, dedicated east and westbound streetcar tracks separated by a boulevard (platform for street car overhead catenary supports and small trees), dedicated bicycle lanes which are separated by line of trees, benches and bicycle racks from the wide pedestrian sidewalk.

Fig.4.29: Toronto Fire Station 334 is situated at the south west corner of the HTO park. The Pronounced elevator shaft of the building is used in the design as a marker and way finding device. Fig.30: Lookout space at the South west corner of HTO Park.

5.1 Design Concept and Approach

Preliminary Designs Drawing on design work promoting urban resilience and symbiosis, the preliminary designs look at available resources. The overpass is parasitically connected to the existing points of interest and provide opportunities for the creation of future connections. As a component of a CPUL, this overpass design includes a community greenhouses, pedestrian and bicycle paths, storm water management and renewable energy generation systems, event spaces as well as recreational spaces that are visually and physically engaging. One of the major design considerations at a micro-scale is the engagement of pedestrians

with the process of food production in an urban environment as observers and participants. A number of conceptual design ideas are explored in this section at different scales in order to generate holistic and well considered design tactics.

Fig.6.3: Concept Sketch 1 Concept Sketch 1: Compression and release. The concept is based gradual widening of paths as a strategy to create a playful irregular environment for pedestrians using hard geometric lines as a representation of control over nature in an urban environment. Greenhouses take on a variety of irregular hard geometric forms as objects that make their presence known in a densely vegetated urban park that stretches over the Gardiner Expressway, connecting the northern part of the expressway to the southern waterfront strip of Toronto.

Fig.6.4: Concept Sketch 2 Concept Sketch 2: The plan is based on a more conventional approach for an overpass. The layout is based on a laminar uninterrupted pedestrian traffic flow with activity spaces placed on the east side of a main walkway while allowing cyclists to move along a parallel path along the west side free of disruptions. Analysis and Findings: The scheme allows for a more modularized system of greenhouses hanging over Lake Shore Boulevard and the Gardiner Expressway. While the greenhouses are different sizes, their glass paneling system is modular, consistent and more in tune with the existing geometries. However, they are removed from the immediate vicinity of the main corridor, separated from the passersby by a buffer zone of green space. Situated almost directly south of an existing residential tower, the greenhouses also block the view of the residents living within the fist few floors of the building. The overhanging extension of the structure on the south beyond the mid-rise building also creates a rather dark space for the occupants of the building, a problem which will be further amplified by the structure required to hold up this extension.

Analysis and Findings: Closer analysis of the scheme reveals major functional issues. The different shaped greenhouses, cantilevering over the main structure poses a variety of complications structurally and economically. A more practical approach would use more conventional modularized systems for the design of the greenhouses. Geometrically, the structure does not fully take advantage of the existing infrastructure and context.

Fig.6.5: Concept Sketch 3 Concept Sketch 3: The need for dramatic changes in elevation to allow crossing over the Gardiner Expressway is used as an opportunity for the design of the over pass in this concept. Two plates, one following the existing grade changes on the north of the highway are connected by a series of stairs and ramps sheltered by strip like canopies stretching along the paths as way to create a sense of directionality and movement through the park. A straight axial path dedicated to bicycles runs along the direct path of movement, sloping upwards from Bremner Boulevard before flattening at the top of the southern plate, passing by the three greenhouses situated on the west side of the plan,before sloping back down and towards street level at Queens Quay. Analysis and Findings: Splitting the park into two sections provides a design opportunity for creating a multilevel node within the scheme as a transition between a lower and an upper level, The plates are oriented in a particular way to face the Rogers Center moving from south to north and the Greenhouses when moving in the opposite direction. Elongated canopies stretch over most of the pedestrian and bicycle path and also serve as a way finding system that marks the central circulation artery.

Fig.6.6: Concept Sketch 3 Analysis

However, the dedicated bicycle path that starts its ascent 14 at Bremner Boulevard creates a number of problems that include sectioning the park longitudinally into two narrow strips that forces pedestrians to chose between sides of the park for their journey. The second problem is the shade the ramp casts over the east side of the northern plate as it ramps up. Shadow studies show that the areas to the east side of the central ramp will receive little sunlight during the day. Finally, the bicycle path while running along a straight course, separates the greenhouses from pedestrians.

6.3 Preliminary Circulation Concepts and Analysis

Circulation Concept 1: The scheme was based on disrupting a straight linear and passive flow of walkers through a space. The straight hatched axis represents the linear uninterrupted flow of pedestrian traffic from one end of the proposed park to the other. The orange line represents of the intended visual and physical engagement of pedestrians though the space. Taking the general shifted floor plate concept from the previous iterations, this scheme also takes into consideration views of the city and what lies beyond the extents of the park. Moving from south to north, the plate is oriented to frame the view of the passersby to the city's skyline with the Rogers Center at its base as a landmark in Toronto. Moving in the opposite direction, the intended view shifts towards the juxtaposition of active reclaimed productive landscape that takes on the form of greenhouses and the Gardiner Expressway's passive character. The scheme aims to provide a series of moments or event spaces along the main passageway to create a way of seamlessly crossing three highspeed vehicular arteries.

The elevated walkway begins its ascent from the ground level at the North-West corner of the Rogers Center. It continues straight, directly parallel to the west facade of the stadium before jogging eastwards and stretching over Bremner Boulevard in order to give walkers a clearer view of the park, minimize the visual obstructions for the occupants of the residential buildings situated on the west side of the park and avoid casting shadows on the community garden during morning hours. The path then returns to its original course at the northern edge of the Lake Shore Boulevard Westbound and is connected to the existing park by both an elevator and stairs.

An amphitheater, an open grassed playground, two greenhouses and an elevated park space lay are situated along the stretch of the corridor spanning over the width of the Gardiner expressway. After crossing the span of the Expressway, the corridor begins its gradual descend and continues across Queen Quay before terminating at an elevated lookout at the waters edge, south west of the current HTO park.* The Bicycle path runs parallel to the elevated walkway before diverting east at the southern end of the corridor and gradually descending down to street level at Queens Quay.

elevated walkway provides an opportunity for rooftop access to some of the existing structures such as the rooftop of the Toronto Fire Station 337. Park Space: The organic form of each green parcel was inspired by the form of the space between the veins of a leaf or the epidermis, while the veins are represented as a meandering pathway for people to move through and enjoy the vegetated park, with benches and resting spots situated along the path. The main central corridor breathes life and movement into the park spaces similar to the midrib of a leaf that provides the cells with sustenance.

Vertical Circulation: Elevators and Stairs The entire park is fully accessible. The elevated walkway stretches over 4 city blocks. Each block contains at least one main staircase and an elevator. A main staircase with a landing that stretches across the width of the park allows a clear view from street level into the community garden and the northern section of the park. The landing is also designed in such way as to allow pedestrians a clear privileged view of the community garden situated directly below and the park space itself encouraging them to use the staircase to access the elevated walkway.

7.3.3 Technologies and Use of Renewable Energies

With economic and social incentives, the dynamics between resources in a city can be greatly improved. An example of this is waste heat. This resource can be redirected to regulate temperatures and air quality in other enclosures such as greenhouses. An example of this approach is being implemented by a number of data centers** That redirect the excess heat from servers into greenhouses to help with heating the air inside. The Notre Dame Center for Research Computing has placed a rack of High Performance Computing nodes at a local municipal greenhouse. Telecity, another data center service company is using the waste head from its servers to heat an on-site botanical garden dedicated to research about climate change. Société Forestière and the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) will use the arboretum to grow and research plants from around the world with the aim of selecting those species most adaptable to changes in the prevailing climatic conditions 1.

Sources of energy in an urban context are abundant. One is the parking lot. University of Delaware has developed a system in which electric vehicles are able to plug into and feed electricity back into the grid when needed 2. On average, cars are parked around 95% of the time 3. Considering the recent moves of the automotive industry towards engineering more efficient electric cars it's not had to imagine that by overcoming certain policy hurdles about private and public properties, public amenities will become more reliant on energy sources available within an immediate context in the city, Wind produced by vehicles traveling at a high speeds is an untapped source of energy. Placing wind horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines over and alongside highways can further assist in energy generation for powering street lights in the surrounding area.

** A data center (sometimes spelled datacenter) is a centralized repository, either physical or virtual, for the storage, management, and dissemination of data and information organized around a particular body of knowledge or pertaining to a particular business.4 GARDINER SKYPARK

134

Reflected light from surrounding buildings is yet another source of energy. Reflected light can contribute to the amount of light plants receive in plots of land that don't receive enough direct sunlight. Reflecting sunlight not only provides opportunities for growing vegetation, but also improve visibility and therefore minimize the need for artificial light. Other technologies that can be incorporated within public infrastructure include piezoelectric materials used for paving that generate electricity through the material's deformation under pressure generated by the pedestrians' feet as they walk on them.

7.3.4 Productive Landscapes and Green Houses

Fig.7.21: Preliminary Design - Greenhouses and community gardens

Community Gardens and Greenhouses: Conceptually, the design celebrates idea of food production taking place within the community gardens and exposes them to passer byers along Bremner Boulevard as well as the Long Park Space that borders the north edge of Lake Shore Boulevard Westbound. They are situated on lots that receive more than 6 hours of daylight throughout the year. The main two storey greenhouse is situated directly

above the Gardiner Expressway. Its structure is a combination of steel, glass and concrete. Northern wall of the greenhouse is primarily covered with concrete, as the structure receives no sunlight from the north. The light coloured concrete wall reflects light back into the greenhouse space while serving as a thermal mass for regulating the temperature inside the structure. The structure provides roughly 800 m2 of enclosed space.

GARDINER SKYPARK

136

Louvers placed on the outside west facade of the greenhouse are connected to a central sensor that will asses lighting conditions and orient the blades in such way as to collectively reflect light received from the sun and the surrounding context into the greenhouse.

Concrete wall on the north side of the Greenhouse serves as a thermal mass and reflects light back into the enclosed greenhouse space

Elevator on the South end of the greenhouse connects the structure down to the ground level and on the south edge of the Lake Shore Boulevard (EB). The elevator is publicly accessible and can also be used to service the greenhouse situated above the Gardiner Expressway.

The multipurpose space underneath the elevated section of the greenhouse can be enclosed during wintertime. The space is left open to allow different activities to take place at different times of the year.

130 m2 of Office Spaces is situated on the northern end and ground level of the greenhouse.

Starting at Front street, the beginning and end of the linear park merge with the existing context and are marked with signature canopies. The elevated segment of the walkway begins its ascent from the ground level at the north-west corner of the Rogers Center. It continues parallel to the west facade of the stadium before jogging eastwards and stretching over Bremner Boulevard in order to give walkers a clearer view of the park, minimize the visual obstructions for the occupants of the residential buildings situated on the west side of the park and avoid casting shadows on the community garden during morning hours. The path then returns to its original course at

the northern edge of the Lake Shore Boulevard Westbound and is connected to the existing park by both an elevator and stairs. The central path passes from underneath the 600 square meter greenhouse situated directly above Lake Shore Boulevard Westbound. The greenhouse shelters an amphitheater on the east side of the central path and is accessible by both ramps and staircases. The greenhouse receives an average of 8 - 12 hours of direct sunlight per day and provides locals with the opportunity to grow various types of vegetables throughout the year. After crossing the span of the Expressway, the corridor begins its gradual descent and continues 144

Detail Plans and Cross Section Section 3 demonstrates the relationship between the elevated park and the Gardiner expressway. The park consists of a series of folded and overlapping planes that make the nature of the structure more topographically engaging for people. The design of the park revolves around the idea of seamlessness and moments of visual connection and disconnection between walkers/cyclists with the Gardiner expressway. As this particular section demonstrates, the peeling of one plane from the other allows walkers a view down to the high speed vehicular artery below while the green space above is intended to obstruct the view of vehicles through the placement of the trees.

Design Critique and Analysis

Fig.8.32: Gardiner SkyPark Renderings

The final design of this thesis project successfully demonstrates how a continuous, fully accessible and barrier free crossing condition can be achieved for pedestrians and cyclists. The existing difference in elevation between the north and the south side of the Gardiner Expressway allow the two sides to be connected through the use of a series of ramps. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic across Bremner Boulevard, Lake Shore Boulevard Westbound, Gardiner Expressway, Lake Shore Boulevard Eastbound and Queens Quay without any interruption to vehicular traffic along these arteries. Greenhouse and the community gardens are designed and strategically placed to be visually engaging Park spaces connect to existing parks via walkways and bicycle routes. Proximity of the elevated pedestrian and bicycle path to the existing residential buildings, limiting views of residents of nearby buildings and the shade and greening of ground level along Lake Shore Boulevard still pose design challenges with respect to shade, quality of space and function and require further design investigation.

Concluding Statements

This thesis project illustrates how the concept of Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes can be applied to Toronto, a densely developed North American winter city, in an effort to overcome challenges to connectivity, sustainability and community engagement. In recent years, rooftops of buildings are being recognized for the opportunities they present for becoming useful amenity spaces to property owners as well as the city. Rooftops of the Telus Headquarters, the Toronto City Hall podium, and the Ryerson Engineering Building are evidence of the trend towards the creation of amenity spaces on existing structures. By taking advantage of the existing urban fabric, it is possible to integrate linear park systems into dense urban cores. This example shows how a linear park is capable of seamlessly reconnecting Toronto's severed waterfront to the dense downtown core. Hidden potentials of rooftops and existing underused spaces can be unlocked and merged into seamless and continuous pedestrian and bicycle thoroughfares in meaningful ways that will contribute to the environmental aesthetics, sustainability and communities in this dense urban context. The concept of urban agriculture and food production within urban environments is no longer theoretical but one that can and is used by architects and urban designers in the practice of place making. Pedestrianization, provision of green space and urban agriculture are all key components of the concept of CPULs. Their benefits are multidimensional; they help create a sense of identity for communities, connect them with each other, make the city more walkable and pleasant, improve the health of the city and the environment, improving the infrastructure and its efficiency.

modes and configurations that integrate and overlay an existing car dominant infrastructure. While the images suggest a wide multilevel green bridge crossing over top of a wide highway system, there are little or no indications of how the existing infrastructure can be utilized for conserving or harvesting energy (wind produced from passing vehicles, solar exposure, heat released from existing buildings, etc). There is also no indication of how the bridges are supported at ground level. However, this project provides an rich example for a series of ideas that can be applied to Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. The decentralized system can be applied to the various different nodes in the city that can be connected by viaducts and paths to the waterfront and take advantage of existing infrastructure that can be used for energy generation that can then be used for food production, lighting and other amenities.

Project Description: The passing of Measure R at the end of 2008 provided Los Angeles County with funds for up to $40 billion in transit-related projects over the next 30 years. The measure also inspired a competition to design new transport solutions, and Paris-based Odile Decq and Bonit Conrnette Architects have proposed an extensive plan to make the `freeway city' a little greener. The project proposes large stretches of green space, a system of small vehicles with designated transportation lanes and parking stations, and a complete overhaul of the city's streets, overpasses, culverts, right of ways, power lines, and underutilized rail lines. 1 This conceptual for Los Angeles project encompasses concepts of future transportation

The rendering of the project on this page also provides a perspective of how elevated green spaces can continue through and along an enclosed shell.

Fig.A.4: Night-time rendering of SF's Green Transbay Terminal

Project Description: The terminal, designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, will extend the Caltrain line by 1.3 miles into the center of the financial district. it will also feature a new 5.4 acre green roof that will act as a city park and will host variety of cultural activities. A redevelopment of the area surrounding the terminal will add 2,600 new homes. In the sustainability arena, the terminal will feature wind turbines, floors that draw fresh air from the outside, Geothermal heating and cooling to regulate temperature, and a gray-water recycling system. Construction on the terminal began in 2008, and should be completed by 2014. 2 This project suggests possibilities for transforming the Gardner expressway in a way that would enable it to become a part of an urban landscape system while still serving as a major transportation artery. The section through the Green Transbay Terminal station in San Francisco demonstrates how an enclosed shell can provide a space that can 181

A.3 The GREEN RIBBON, Toronto, Canada

Fig.A.8: Aerial rendering of The GREEN RIBBON

Project Description: The GREEN RIBBON proposes creating seven kilometres of green roof over the existing elevated Gardiner Expressway, keeping the highway intact and providing Toronto with new recreational parkland for pedestrians and cyclists. Inserting eighty acres of green roof in the city centre will reduce the heat island effect, create a sustainable environment and generate clean energy through the use of photovoltaics. This creative adaptive reuse of infrastructure that has suffered decades of neglect will enhance vehicular and pedestrian safety, protect a vital transportation artery and retain the existing structure for future reuse in a post-automobile era. Innovative and precedent setting, the design provides a new methodology for re-purposing aging infrastructure in an economical, sustainable and socially responsible manner. Predicted increases in property value and further development of neighbourhoods from the Lower Port Lands to Liberty Village are supported by integrating this active green space into the core of the city. 3
GARDINER SKYPARK

The Green Ribbon provides a case study of an adaptive use of the Gardiner Expressway. While providing a 7km long stretch of green parkland over the existing elevated highway, the green space, it is a forward looking project that predicts the future re-purposing of the Gardiner for future modes of transportation. Quadrangle architects however do not provide any indication of how this space can be easy accessed from ground level, nor how it helps connect the Toronto waterfront to the rest of the city north of the highway. While the bold proposal of how future cities can increase green space through adaptive use of existing infrastructure, it does not address how the scheme solves the separation between the downtown fore of the city and its waterfront, where it begins and how, and how it connects (or doesn't connect) to existing green spaces.

is the passage of vehicles with no pedestrian activity. The value of this case study lies in the possible variations to this gesture that can be applied to a continuous productive network system. As land is a precious commodity in a dense skyscraper dominant urban context like Toronto, it is important to take advantage of systems and spaces that can contribute to greening the city as well as multi-modal transport.

Fig.A.11. Aerial rendering of Greened Expressway

Project Description: "The Central Kowloon Route is one of the most recent examples. Current plans [ for Hong Kong ] call for an expressway to be tunneled across the Kowloon peninsula, from a highway near the old Kai Tak Airport in the east to the West Kowloon expressway in the west. This in and of itself could be a good thing, since it has the potential to remove cross-town truck and bus traffic from noisy and polluted surface streets. But instead of using the new tunnel as a way to reduce the impact of traffic on surface roads, the government is increasing it. Along with the construction of the tunnel, the Central Kowloon Route will involve the widening of the existing Gascoigne Road flyover that runs through one of the city's most denselypopulated neighborhoods" 4 Similar to the Green TransBay Terminal station in Los Angeles, this proposal for Hong Kong portrays a shell system that covers a flyover bridge. The green double-layer skin of the proposal acts as a noise barrier as well as a containment of the pollution produced by vehicles that pass through it. The flyover is a similar condition to Gardiner expressway. It is elevated and its primary function 183

2 revitalizations are now underway. 5 The revitalization of the City Hall Podium roof, transforming it into a publicly accessible green space, demonstrates ways in which a public space can connect to an elevated park or greenspace via a ramp that maneuvers its way around a to connect the two spaces. Both spaces contain opportunities for a variety of different activities.

Fig.A13: Aerial rendering of the City Hall Podium Green Roof

Project Description: The winning design for the Nathan Phillips Square Revitalization Project is based on the idea that Nathan Phillips Square has always acted as an agora, the ancient Athenian place of public and political exchange. The theme clearly defines the inner open space of theatre and square ­ a theatre for the city surrounded by a forested perimeter. New program elements include a public pavilion with skating rink support facilities, food concession and an upper level roof terrace overlooking the Square, a new tourist Info Kiosk, a versatile new outdoor theatre and a new two storey restaurant. These program elements not only activate the square but serve as vertical connectors to the elevated walkway which defines the site. The first phase of the revitalization project has now been realized with the reopening of the City Hall Podium Green Roof during Doors Open Toronto 2010, as the city's largest, publicly accessible green roof.

A.6 Urban Agriculture Hub, Toronto, Canada

Fig.A.14: Street view rendering of Urban Agriculture Hub

Project Description: "The project features greenhouse spaces below the raised section of the highway, utilizing the side facing south to capture sunlight and the heavyweight structure of the highway for thermal mass to regulate temperature inside the building. Other features of the project include the remediation and reuse of wasteland adjacent to the highway for additional "community-based" productive land, and the integration of educational facilities and a commercial space that sells garden supplies in addition to food and plants produced in the large greenhouse. Adding to the sustainable agenda for this project, tiny turbines were conceived for the highway's median strip to generate electrical energy for the building through the wind from cars passing along the expressway. The building was also conceived around reused components and recycled materials available from nearby wherever possible. This concept has the potential to be implemented below many raised highway structures with unused or underused land below" 6 In dealing with the Gardiner Expressway and its transformation as a key component for creating a CPUL, it is important to embrace a variety

of possibilities in which the process of food production can be integrated, to take advantage of the existing condition of the elevated highway. The Urban Agriculture Hub is such a project that looks at key energy saving strategies and space utilization of the area underneath the Gardiner Expressway. The project also looks into sustainable building strategies including the reuse of waste materials, and the generation of electricity by placing wind turbines on the median strip of the highway above for energy generation. Some examples of turbines harvesting the wind energy generated by passing vehicles are shown below.

A.7 A Post-Carbon Don Mills, Toronto, Canada

Fig.A.17: Rendered plan of Post-Carbon Don Mills Project

Project Description: This proposal is located north of Downtown Toronto, on a decommissioned rail corridor in Don Mills. With the mandate of transitioning the community to a Post Carbon future, this project acts on both a regional and a local scale. Through the integration of leisure and community spaces, transportation systems and urban agriculture, this corridor provides the necessary infrastructure for change. In addition to its more tangible goals, this project seeks to inspire and provide the residents of Don Mills with a positive vision of their future in a Post Carbon world. Moving beyond traditional urban farming, this proposal integrates multiple uses to create an urban condition along the corridor. Parallel to the gardens, transportation and service infrastructure have been introduced to increase connectivity within the community and the city. The allotment gardens themselves are conceived as backyard extensions, and to provide outdoor growing space to those living in apartment buildings. Owned by a regulating body, the gardens can be purchased or rented with their yield being used to feed local families or to be sold at a local farmers market. Owners/renters may also choose to hire SPIN Farmers to tend to their garden.
GARDINER SKYPARK

This project focuses on the points of intersection between the corridor and the major streets, specifically the intersection at Lawrence Avenue. At this point, one can access an elevated bicycle/small vehicle roadway, a rail-based transit network and a local road serving the allotment gardens. These systems are thoughtfully integrated into the linear park and the existing suburban fabric in order to foster social interactions and spontaneous events. 7 This project is designed as a continuous productive urban landscape. Its relationship with residential houses and backyards, major streets and the surrounding context shines inspires ideas that can be used in a denser urban context. The relationship with rail corridor provides a collaborative continuous atmosphere along a strip of land. This continuity not only creates a sense of community for residents but also a food production artery that is easily and efficiently transportable from once place to another. If the backyard of a house can become a small piece of a larger network, it is perhaps possible to translate this idea to stacked and integrated volumes in a denser urban area along a major artery such as the Gardiner expressway. The elevated highway can become a way to connect the food hubs. Each smaller hub will then contribute to the existence of what a continuous productive urban landscape can be in the city.

A.8 Lufa Farms, Montreal, Canada

Fig.A.19: Photograph of Lufa Farms Interior space

Project Description: Dedicated to sustainable urban agriculture, Lufa Farms inc. built two of the first commercial roof greenhouses in the world. It's founder, Mohammed, had a vision to revolutionize food production. His mission has been accomplished, since the greenhouses produce many varieties of vegetables without pesticides or synthetic herbicides throughout the year, with enough capacity to feed six thousand Montreal families. Since receiving its Fondation Montréal inc. grant, Lufa has designed a new greenhouse in Laval and is working on another in Boston. The firm now has 45 employees 8 Lufa Farms is an example of the adaptation of rooftop spaces to become growing spaces. The rooftop greenhouse receives an abundance of sunlight because of its placement on a rooftop with no blockage of sunlight. Because of its placement on a rooftop, the greenhouse also benefits from the excess heat that normally escapes through the roof of the structure, minimizing its need for heating during cold winter days. 187

In order to minimize the amount of water required form the city, Lufa Farms use a rainwater harvesting system. Another reasoning behind using rainwater is that when nutrient rich water finds its way into municipal water supply it cause the growth of algae which later creates other problems for the farm. Because of the highly controlled internal environment, the operation of the greenhouse does not require the use of chemical pesticides. Only biological pest control methods are used. 8

A.9 Lower Bay Street Development, Toronto, Canada
plan a massive multi-phased redevelopment of the combined parcels [around Union Station] with Houston-based multi-national developer Hines acting as the development manager for at least the first phase, planned for the 45 Bay parking lot site. A competition was recently held to choose an architectural firm to design the development. The winner was Wilkinson Eyre Architects of London England. The overall design includes 3 towers, each with paired volumes of varying heights, all marked by a diagrid with interposed 12-storey diamond-shaped and faceted sections. 9 45 Lower Bay Street development is an example of how the owners of various parcels of land can partner up together with the municipal and public sector to create better and more integrated buildings that form the building blocks of a city.
Fig.A.21. Night-time rendering of Lower Bay Street Development

Project Description: The parking lot site at 45 Bay is to be combined with adjacent parcels to the north; the space above the east end of the Union Station platforms and tracks, the GO Union Bus Terminal to its north, and the Dominion Public Building at 1 Front Street West. 45 Bay is owned by Ivanhoé Cambridge, Union Station is owned by the City of Toronto, the rail assets associated with the Union Station Railway Corridor are owned by GO Transit, the Dominion Public Building is owned by the Government of Canada. The various parcels have banded together to
GARDINER SKYPARK

The proposal consists of 3 towers situated on the two sides of the GO Train Railway corridor. One of the main features of the design proposal is the bridging of the two towers that spans the width of railway corridor to provide access for pedestrians to be able to cross the tracks more easily. The crossing provides indoor and outdoor spaces. Images provided by Wilkinson Architects imply that the pedestrian crossings will be housing retail and entertainment spaces for the public. This project shows that strategies are already being embraced by developers.

A.10 PATH Bridge Extension underneath the Gardiner Expressway, Toronto

Fig.A.22: Rendering of PATH Bridge Extension

Project Description: The bridge, designed by WZMH Architects, runs from the Air Canada Centre, underneath the Gardiner Expressway and over Lake Shore Boulevard to Menkes' Sun Life Financial Tower and Harbour Plaza Residences development, which is also currently under construction. From there, the bridge will continue south over Harbour Street and the Yonge off-ramp to connect to its final destination, Waterpark Place. Though the idea of tunneling the connection was discussed, water levels, building foundations and the underground parking for the convention centre would have made it physically difficult. 10 The path extension bridge under the Gardiner Expressway is perhaps the first of very many other bridges that will be spanning over the Gardiner 189

Expressway as the city attempts to make its waterfront more accessible. Accessibility is not only limited to people visiting the waterfront but as development of office and residential towers along the Gardiner Expressway intensifies, there will be an even bigger need for people to be able to be able to cross Lake Shore Boulevard and the Gardiner safely. This project also echoes a new attitude towards urban development which is that of partnered developers and collaboration with the city to create more integrated built forms and have more intimate relationships with our infrastructure.

A.11 Promenade Plantée, Paris, France
The tree lined walkway in Paris is an interesting example of what elevated walkway can do for the residents of a city in providing a seamless, fluid and enjoyable walking experience while connection a number of different shopping areas and nodes within the city. The elevated walkway is situated approximately 10 meters above street level and relies on a stairs, ramps and elevators along its path to connect to the ground level at various points along its stretch.
Fig.A.23: Photograph of park space along the Promenade Plantee

Project Description: Created in 1988 by Philippe Mathieux and Jacques Vergely on the former railway line, which linked Place de la Bastille to VarenneSaint-Maur from 1859, the Promenade Plantée mixes areas of wild vegetation that has sprung up alongside the railway line with more modern landscaped areas. It begins behind the Bastille opera house and runs above avenue Daumesnil to the Jardin de Reuilly: it is the famous Viaduc des Arts. The Allée Vivaldi then comprises the shopping part of the walkway. Then, it continues through tunnels and trenches and ends at Porte Dorée and the Bois de Vincennes. An extraordinary journey along 4.5 km planted with many types of lime and hazelnut trees, climbing plants, rosebushes and other plants. The walk gives you the opportunity to admire various remarkable views of the most modern and typical parts of the 12th arrondissement.11
GARDINER SKYPARK

Other important aspects of this project that make this case study relevant to this thesis project is the architectural consistency in the language of the elevated walkway and the methods and strategies of the intertwined ramps and stairs and the various plantation methods along the vertical circulation spaces. This walkway plays an important role in seamlessly connecting various points of the city of Paris making them easily accessibly by the public, encouraging people to walk to their destinations using this pathway.

A.12 Garden Bridge, London, England

Fig.A.24: Garden Bridge rendering

Project Description: "The Garden Bridge is a new 366m-long footbridge that will stretch across the River Thames, from the top of Temple underground station to the South Bank. The bridge will hold an expansive garden. Footpaths will weave through the garden, creating a new pedestrian route which will be free and open to all between the hours of 6am­midnight. The garden will be an enchanted space in the middle of the busy city. It will feature an abundance of plants, trees and shrubs indigenous to the UK, Northern Europe and other parts of the world. These have all been chosen for their biodiversity, bringing wildlife and horticulture to the heart of London. The planting has been carefully designed to ensure that it will frame and enhance views of the iconic landmarks of London. The garden consists of several sequential spaces, designed to reflect a number of different characteristics of the rich cultural heritage of the capital's river and both river banks, so that a pedestrian crossing the bridge will walk through an ever-changing seasonal landscape. The bridge has been designed to offer pedestrians a series of unique spaces throughout the garden, providing a sense of intimacy on your journey 191

across the River Thames. There are opportunities to stop and look, to explore and meander through the gardens, or walk directly across as part of a wider journey. The Garden Bridge will be created for the enjoyment of people for generations to come. This new landmark will showcase the best of British design and will be used by all, becoming a cherished part of London's landscape."12

The Garden Bridge is an example of a how pedestrian bridges are being redefined as multifunctional infrastructural components in urban environments. The proposed pedestrian bridge offers a pleasant experience for people, increases greenspace while connecting the two sides of the city.

A.13 11th Street Bridge Park, Washington, D.C. US

Fig.A.25: Aerial perspective rendering of 11th Street Bridge Park

Project Description: "As the old 11th Street river bridges that connect Washington, DC's Capitol Hill and historic Anacostia neighborhoods are being replaced, the District government and THEARC will transform the aged infrastructure into the city's first elevated park: a new venue for healthy recreation, environmental education and the arts. The 11th Street Bridge Park will span the capital's cityscape and include outdoor performance spaces, playgrounds, fruit orchards, classrooms to teach students about river systems and even kayaks and paddle boats. Bound by the Washington Navy Yard on one side and the National Park Service's Anacostia Park on the other, the Bridge Park will be a destination for some, a pedestrian or bicycle route for others and an iconic architectural symbol across the Anacostia River.
GARDINER SKYPARK

The 11th Street Bridge Park promises to be a place unlike any other in Washington, DC ­ one that supports the community's physical, environmental and economic health. The community behind the 11th Street Bridge Park has four goals: Create a healthy community by establishing a safe place for residents to exercise and play Connect the community with the Anacostia River Reconnect the neighborhoods of Anacostia and Capitol Hill Generate new jobs and economic activity" 13 "Our design for the 11th Street Bridge Park-the Anacostia Crossing-is a place of exchange. The park at Anacostia Crossing will connect two historically disparate sides of the river with a series of outdoor programmed spaces and active zones that will provide an engaging place hovering above, yet anchored in, the Anacostia River. 192

To create this place-more destination than elevated thoroughfare-we have designed the bridge park as a clear moment of intersection where two sides of the river converge and coexist. Anacostia Crossing will offer layered programs, presenting a new neighborhood park, an after-hours destination for the nearby workforce, a retreat for residents and a territory for tourists to explore."13 Running parallel to an existing bridge dedicated to vehicular traffic, the 11th Street Bridge Park is an example of a destination bridge that connects communities on the two sides of the Anacostia river. The bridge is more than just a crossing and through-fare. It provides a series of outdoor programs that provide spaces for people to exercise, learn, play and produce. Individual geometric parcels dedicated to a variety of uses for commercial and non commercial activities are arranged at different angles along a central corridor. A sculpture garden, a playground, an interactive art space and other programmed open spaces have been identified on two intersecting planes.

Fig.A.26: Programing Diagram

It is interesting to realize the importance of this project as more than a piece of infrastructure but an architectural intervention that is socially and economically productive as it forms a gathering space for people to enjoy their journeys from one place to the next. The productive landscape situated at the midway of the bridge is symbolic of a new perspective on how current and future architects will imagine public spaces and the importance of the integration of economically productive landscape into public infrastructure.

Fig.A.28: Photograph of lowered seating space at Houtan Park

Project Description: "Built on a brownfield of a former industrial site, Houtan Park is a regenerative living landscape on Shanghai's Huangpu riverfront. The park's constructed wetland, ecological flood control, reclaimed industrial structures and materials, and urban agriculture are integral components of an overall restorative design strategy to treat polluted river water and recover the degraded waterfront in an aesthetically pleasing way"15 "The objective of the park design was to: create a green Expo, accommodate for a large influx of visitors during the exposition from May to October, demonstrate green technologies, transform a unique space to make the Expo an unforgettable event, and transition into a permanent public waterfront park after the Expo."14 Elevational relationship between the main access route and seating spaces and the heavily vegetated parcels has influenced this thesis design project. Houtan Park also addresses the other urban
GARDINER SKYPARK

issues such as flood control and restorative design strategy using various methods to irrigate the vegetation and cleanse polluted water from the Huangpu river. While the design project is not situated on a brownfield site, vegetated park space provides soft surfacing and a filtration system for rainwater management. Rainwater collected on the surface of the Gardiner Expressway is currently drained onto the space underneath the elevated highway. This proposal looks at various ways in which storm water can be collected and passively treated to irrigate plants in the park and the community gardens as way to alleviate some stress on the current storm water management systems in a meaningful and sustainable way.

The River of Flowers Central London has been mapped to encourage more organizations to join it and grow wild 15
Fig.A.30: Photograph - River of flowers

Relevance: The River of Flowers initiative is an example of the importance of creating a continuous urban landscape as a way of creating a highway for wildlife and bee species to move through and pollinate flowers. Bees pollinate flowers and vegetation in order for them to reproduce and in turn feed us.  This thesis design project aims to demonstrate a small piece of infrastructure that is a part of a larger green strip that will run alongside both edges of the Gardiner Expressway with crossing conditions for pedestrians and attract more wildlife to the city by creating natural, green and continuous environments for them to thrive. In turn, bees will provide opportunities for a number of different productive landscapes for food production. The continuous landscape will create an enjoyable walking experience for people, promoting healthy lifestyles, encouraging people to walk and bike to different places in the city. An extended path with rest spots that will take on the shape of well developed green pedestrian crossing conditions will connect communities and help reconnect the city's waterfront, its communities and revitalization efforts back to the downtown core. 195
APPENDIX A: CASE STUDIES

Project Description: River of Flowers Central London launched on 18 August 2014 as part of the 125th Anniversary celebrations of The Savoy, a Fairmont managed hotel. Situated on the banks of the Thames since 1889, the iconic Savoy hotel led the initiative to create the capital's first ever River of Flowers Central London to inspire more planting of native wildflowers in the city and to raise awareness of green and floral spaces already existing along the Thames. All along the river, green spaces planted with wildflowers are creating a necklace of floral `pit-stops' to nourish and protect bees and other pollinators. River of Flowers has produced a map tracing the path of this new River of Flowers by plotting the wild gardens, meadows and groves of trees along the north and south banks of the Thames for people to follow in a Wildflower Walk. The trail connects the iconic Savoy hotel with the illustrious partners of the new River of Flowers Central London, which are ensuring plenty of flowers and forage for butterflies and other pollinators as well as creating homes for bees. These include the Garden Museum, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Tate Modern's community garden. The walk will also introduce visitors and residents to wild spaces in

A.16 High Line, New York City, US
Relevance: The New York High-Line is perhaps one of the most well known linear parks around the globe. It is an example of land reclamation. The project uses an existing infrastructure as a platform for creation of a pedestrian realm that is used by New Yorkers as a seamless way of moving around the city and a refuge from the busy streets, creating a safe and car free vegetated green infrastructure for everyone to use and enjoy. Water runoffs are seeped into the ground and the paving's separation and drains into the soil in which the vegetated are planted in, reducing the amount of water runoff. The New York High-Line provides a continuous piece of green infrastructure in a dense urban environment and has inspired many urban planners and architects around the world who have adopted the idea and strategy to develop similar projects that become ingrained into different urban fabrics.

Fig.A.31: Photograph of the New York High Line

Project Description: The High Line is an elevated freight rail line transformed into a public park on Manhattan's West Side. It is owned by the City of New York, and maintained and operated by Friends of the High Line. Founded in 1999 by community residents, Friends of the High Line fought for the High Line's preservation and transformation at a time when the historic structure was under the threat of demolition. It is now the non-profit conservancy working with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation to make sure the High Line is maintained as an extraordinary public space for all visitors to enjoy. In addition to overseeing maintenance, operations, and public programming for the park, Friends of the High Line works to raise the essential private funds to support more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget, and to advocate for the transformation of the High Line at the rail yards, the third and final section of the historic structure, which runs between West 30th and West 34th Streets.16

the potential to be easily tailored to different needs and conditions including financial ones. The outcome is a 35 meters wide and 144 meters long platform which would hover and stretch beyond the focus area to create a seamless connection with the land and improve pedestrian connections. The structure would form a roof allowing to shade specific areas positioned on an easy promenade featuring social active functions such as meeting points or market places. The extended pavement would still be giving necessary clearance for each type of traffic,where cars,bicycles would have it's own lane, designed to changing vehicular needs. While the bridge would be a functional connector it's character and essence would be defined by nature and the Atlanta City itself. 10th Street Bridge would concentrate on creating a positive impact offering a varied program and presenting a new neighborhood park which would be a retreat for residents and a territory to explore for motorists who travel along the roadway without stopping. The top part of the strip would be entirely devoted to pedestrians, green areas and urban 197
APPENDIX A: CASE STUDIES

Project Description: Green City Spectator ­ Atlanta 10th Street Bridge The proposed design is not intended to be seen just as a normal bridge or a path which is just the shortest link. The existing structure fulfills this requirement well enough. In this case it's character and essence would be deeply rooted in making the city center of Atlanta more accessible and user friendly to the community. Because modern monuments don't need to be just statues. They can be structures,areas , surfaces or places strengthening interaction, focused on performance in many ways, on what they can give in return to the eco-system, nature and society due to claiming of a piece of land. Hence the bridge design does not have to derive from aesthetics, being a sculptural form what would not bring any solutions for the issues of those who live within and visit Atlanta using the connections above the connector via car, bicycle, transit, and pedestrian movement systems. It can be a performative approach showcased in this parametric bridge design proposal which has

farming making it a pleasant destination for contemplation for some and a desirable urban place for other individuals to interact.17 Relevance: The Green City Spectator is a project very similar to the project proposed in this thesis design exercise. The pedestrian bridge is designed exclusively for pedestrians and focuses on not just creating connections but place-making. The pedestrian bridge contains active spaces for people to engage with, urban farming and play spaces while it provides a seamless experiential connection for pedestrians to flow through and enjoy. The bridge is designed as a series of connections that will stitch two sides of a high traffic wide vehicular road and unite the green linear parks that run parallel to the road.
