InvestigatingtheRoleofPublicParticipationinWindEnergyProjectDevelopmentin Ontario AnahitaAsadolahniajami DoctorofPhilosophy,2016 EnvironmentalAppliedScienceandManagement,RyersonUniversity Abstract Over the past several decades, the scope of decision-making in the public domain has changed from a focus on unilateral regulatory verdicts to a more comprehensive process that engages all stakeholders. Consequently, there has been a distinct increase in public participationintheenvironmentaldecision-makingprocess.Whilethepotentialbenefitsof public engagement are substantial in terms of identifying synergies between public and industry stakeholders that encourage project development, this participation does not comewithoutitschallenges.Tomeetglobalenergydemandsandfulfillambitioustargets for greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy has received increased attention as a feasible alternative to conventional sources of energy. However, current literature on renewable energy, particularly on wind power, highlights potential social barriers to renewable energy investment. This study investigates the role of public participation by reviewing two case studies of the Ontario wind power generation market to identify the facilitators and constrainers that affected public input into wind project development in Ontario and recommends a participatory framework in the hope of improving public engagementinthewindprojectdevelopmentdecision-makingprocess.Therecommended framework in this research requires all stakeholders to reconsider their current roles in thedecision-makingprocess.Thepublicshouldengageinprojectplanningandmonitorthe

1.Introduction
1.1.ResearchBackground Thenatureofgovernments'contributiontosocietyhaschangedinresponsetotheexternal pressures of globalization, international social movements, and managing their own domesticaffairs.Delegationanddecentralizationofgovernments'roleandresponsibilities in providing services and the influence of a growing number of community-based organizations (CBO) have resulted in increased citizen participation in the regulatory decision-making process (Figure 1). In other words, there has been a shift in political approachfromgoverningtogovernance.Overthepastseveraldecades,thescopeofpublic decision-making has changed from a focus on state officials and experts' verdicts to comprehensively addressing stakeholders' demands and engaging citizens (Savan et al., 2004). Consequently,therehasbeenadistinctincreaseinpublicparticipationinenvironmental decision-makingprocesses.Thismaybedueto:publicawarenessandcitizens'demandsto haveagreaterroleindecisionsthataffecttheirwelfare;arecognitionofthebenefits(e.g. citizen's accountability and responsibility) of involving citizens in decision-making processes by public officials; compliance with new regulations, which have made it necessarytoincludepublicopinion,specificallyinriskarenas;improvementofthequality ofdecision-makingbyavoidingunpopularpolicies;andtheachievementofakeyprinciple ofademocraticsocietytoacknowledgethebasichumanrightsregardingproceduraljustice (CharnleyandEngelbert,2005;RoweandFrewer,2000;Wesselink etal.,2011).According toBijlsmaetal.(1988,pg.397)"ifdecision-makingconcerningtheuseanddevelopmentof

Whilethepotentialbenefitsofpublicengagementaresubstantial,thisparticipationdoes notcomewithoutitschallenges.Someofthesekeychallengesinclude:alackofknowledge in the case of complex technical issues; a more time-consuming process; an incomplete understanding of issues by citizens, potentially resulting in a different interpretation of action consequences; a different perception of risk by citizens and experts; and finally, individual differences in values, beliefs, motivations, and conflicts of interest that may prevent reaching a consensus (Fischer, 2009; McCallum and Santos, 1997; Rowe and Frewer, 2000). These factors can limit the benefits of public participation in making complexpolicydecisions. To meet global energy demands and fulfill ambitious targets for greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy has received increased attention as a feasible alternative to

2 

conventional sources of energy (Corscadden etal., 2012; Haggett, 2011; McLaren Loring, 2007). Current literature on renewable energy, particularly on wind energy, highlights potential technological, economic, social, or public barriers to renewable energy investment(Richards etal.,2012).Whatdistinguisheswindpowerfromotherrenewable energy sources is its visibility in the landscape, which remains the key factor in public opposition(Colebyetal.,2009).Inthecaseofdevelopinganewwindenergyproject,public officialsmustbalancetheneedsandviewsofthelocalpublicwiththelargerjurisdictional targets and interests. As McLaren Loring (2007, pg. 2648) states, "members of the local communities often object to proposed wind turbines on the grounds of visual intrusion, noise pollution or local environmental disturbance. In many cases, well-organized local oppositiongroupsform." Wright (2012, pg. 6) referenced Breukers and Wolsink (2007) in describing public participationas"anon-specifictermthatisopentointerpretation,howeverinthecontext of wind energy, there is precedent to accept the following idealized definition: direct involvementbyresidentsinplanmakingbeyondthatofformalconsultation,i.e.facilitating citizenswithanopportunitytoinfluencetheplanningprocess". Forthepurposesofthisstudy,publicparticipationwillgenerallybeunderstoodasthe contribution of groups or individuals (independent of project developers and governmentalagencies)tothedecision-makingprocess.Thepublicusuallyhasaninterest in the outcome of such a decision, because they may be affected by the outcome of that decision, either directly or indirectly (Wouters et al., 2011). Public participation encouragesdecisionsthatareinlinewithcitizenpreferences,resultinginincreasedlevels ofsupportfromthepublicandlessreluctancetotheacceptanceoftheproposal(Irvinand

3 

Stansbury, 2004). However, incorporating the public's view into the decision-making processisnotwithoutcost.  1.2.PurposeandScope Withthatinmind,thetwomainobjectivesofthisstudyare:(1)toidentifyfacilitatorsand theconstraintsthataffectpublicinputintowindprojectdevelopment;and(2)toprovide guidance to improve the practice of public consultation in a wind project development decision-making process. This study aims to answer the core question: "How does public participation affect the public decision-making process of developing a wind energy project?" To answer this core question, two sub-questions must be addressed: "What are the major social conflicts of wind power development?" and "What is the role of a knowledge-broker(trustedthirdparty)inresolvingtheseconflicts?" In order to answer the core question, there is a need to investigate the role of local/provincialauthoritiesinmanagingsuchparticipationinordertoreachaconsensus. TheOntariowindenergysectorprovidesanappropriatecontextwithinwhichtoexplore theadvantagesanddisadvantagesofpublicparticipationandtheinfluenceofknowledgebroker.Thisisbecausethesectoris:(1)inaprocessofgrowthinresponsetogovernment initiatives,mostnotablythroughthe GreenEnergyandGreenEconomyAct(GEA);and(2)it has active actors and networks of opponents. This research provides two case studies of the Ontario, Canada wind power generation market. The cases are built using qualitative methodsofdatacollectionprimarilyfromdocuments,observation,andinterviews.

1.3.MotivationsfortheResearch Much of the existing literature focuses on the rationale, motivations, benefits, limitations, andchallengesofpublicparticipationandhowthepublicmaybeinvolvedinthedecisionmaking process in order to reach a consensus. Despite the established need for public engagement in wind energy project approvals, improving the practice of public consultationinawindprojectdevelopmentdecision-makingprocessrequiresareviewof the literature that describes the various strategies that could be adopted for public participation. A conceptual framework for effective public participation can then be derivedfromtheintegrationofthesestrategies.Mostavailableliteratureonwindenergy developmentdiscussestheeconomicandpoliticalbarriers,whilerelativelylittleresearch has specifically focused on effective communication and the role of a trusted third party (whom for the purpose of the research will be referred to as a knowledge-broker) in the decision-makingprocess.Therefore,thereisstillaneedforfurtherresearchontheroleof knowledge-brokersinresolvingsocialconflictsofwindprojectdevelopment. Thisstudycontributestoacademicknowledgebyseekingtoaddressthesegapsthrough a participatory framework that highlights the role of a knowledge-broker in regulatory governance.Toexaminetheroleofpublicparticipationandthetrustedthirdpartyinthe wind energy industry, there is a need to conduct exploratory case studies. It is a sincere hope that this study will support developers' activities by providing a participatory framework for public participation that may help guide and encourage developers to undertake an effective and morally justified approval process for renewable energy projects.

2.LiteratureReview
2.1.PublicResponsestoWindPower WindpowercurrentlyaccountsforninepercentofOntario'sinstalledgenerationcapacity; it is the fastest growing renewable energy source and will continue to play an increased role in supplying electricity (IESOa, 2015). Figure 2 demonstrates that Ontario is at the forefrontofwindenergyinCanada,withawindpowerinstalledcapacityexceeding4,361 Megawatts (MW). There are currently more than 79 wind facilities in Ontario, with a numberofadditionalwindprojectsbeingdeveloped(CanWEA,2015). 


Figure2:Canada'swindinstalledcapacity(adaptedfromCanWEA)

Opinion polls have indicated that the majority support switching from conventional fossil fuels to wind energy development in Canada (Bell et al., 2005). However, the gap between plan and practice appears wide. While many people at the national level have

6 

expressed the desire to utilize wind energy, there has been conflict at the local level (Wright, 2012). Some scholars (Bell et al., 2005; Devine-Wright, 2005; Wolsink and Breukers, 2010) describe this social gap as NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard). The NIMBY perceptions of wind farms have been used as a means of describing the tension between the general support for wind energy and local opposition to specific developments. This oppositionisattributedtotheself-interestoflocalresidentswhoseNIMBYsentimentsare drivenbytheirdeterminationofthenetcostsandbenefits(Wolsink,2000).Thesenegative attitudesoftenresultfromfearsrelatingtotheperceivedimpactonhumanhealth,thelocal environment, and individual property value (Coleby et al., 2009). However, the NIMBY explanation has been characterized as being overly simplistic and the empirical research oncommunitieshasbeenlackinginspecificsrelatedtotheinfluencethatsocialnetworks, socialrepresentations,andsocialidentitieshaveonacommunity'sattitudetoawindfarm (Devine-Wright,2005).  2.1.1.FactorsInfluencingProjectSuccess Publicobjectionsraisequestionsregardingthefactorsthatinhibitcommunityacceptance ofwindenergyprojects.Indevelopingawindenergyproject,stakeholders,whofeelthey have not been consulted or their perspectives have not been considered, usually form a strongoppositiontorenewableenergypolicyinitiativesthatcanpreventthemfrombeing implemented.Aproposedsolutionbymanyscholarsisanenvironmentalassessment(EA) during the development process, which considers the involvement of the community in addressing possible environmental impacts, not only to identify key local environmental knowledge, but also to reach mutual support between the project developers and the

7 

public.EAisaproactiveplanningtoolthatenablesdevelopers,authorities,andthepublic to identify, evaluate, and control the potential environmental damages from a proposed project before implementation (FitzpatrickandSinclair, 2003). However, this method can beexpensiveandtime-consuming(Colebyetal.,2009;Gibsonetal.,2005;O'Faircheallaigh, 2010;WeblerandTuler,2006). McLaren Loring (2007) compared wind energy planning using 18 case studies in England,Wales,andDenmark.McLarenLoringarticulatedseveralmajorfactorsthataffect the success of developing wind projects with a higher level of public participation. These include: the involvement of a full range of potential stakeholders; minimizing the involvementbarriers(e.g.timeandlocationofthepublicmeetings);collaborativedecisionmaking by planners and local community members; financial ownership of the project; initiationoftheprojectbyalocalgrouporindividualinsteadofanoutsider;thecontinued involvementofthelocalcommunityevenafterconstruction;astrongrelationshipamong actors within a network (this is applicable for both supporters and opponents); excellent communication within the network; charismatic critical actor; and positive media coverage, which could be directed by both supporters and opponents. Based on the data analysisresultsofthesecasestudies,McLarenLoring(2007,pg.2658)concluded,"projects with high levels of participatory planning are more likely to be publicly accepted and successful. In addition, stable supporting networks are more likely to form. Although the presenceofastablenetworkofsupportersisnotrelatedtoprojectacceptanceandsuccess, the absence of a stable network of opponents is necessary for project acceptance and successinreceivingplanningpermission."

Another study, conducted by Corscadden et al. (2012), also put emphasis on the importance of high-level consultation and early communication with communities. Based on the results of a survey undertaken in Nova Scotia, which identified public perception relatedtocommunity-scalewindenergyprojects,Corscadden etal.emphasizedthatsuch consultationprovidesaforumforincreasedsocialacceptanceandreducedconflict. It is important to note that both regulatory policies and regulatory governance are importantfactorsinthesuccessorfailureofawindproject.Holburn etal.(2010)describe regulatory governance (the decision-making process) as a mechanism that constrains regulatory discretion and the resolution of resulting conflicts despite the introduction of regulatory incentives (policy instruments) such as renewable energy pricing and grid connection rights, which in Ontario include the Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) program, completive procurementauctions,andatermedRenewableEnergySupply(RES)program.Holburn et al.(2010,pg.469)contendthat,"inthecaseofOntario,despitelargemarketpotentialand comparatively strong regulatory incentive policies, weak regulatory governance is one factorthathasaccountedforthechallengesinimplementinglarge-scaleprivateinvestment inpowergenerationatareasonablecost." Thelackofstakeholderorpublicconsultation,thefutureinstabilityofexistingpolicies, and politicized policy-making processes - where an elected minister has greater control overregulatorypoliciesratherthanindependentagencies-hasresultedinrelativelylesscredibleregulatorygovernanceinOntarioascomparedwithGermanyandTexas,bothof which have established stable regulatory frameworks arising from comprehensive legislation and specific commitments to renewable capacity targets (Holburn etal., 2010; JacobssonandLauber,2006;LangnissandWiser,2003).

9 

Pasqualetti etal.(2002)alsobelievethatthesuccessofwindprojectsdependsonhow well the industry learns to consolidate public opinion in the decision-making process by addressing concerns and incorporating suggestions. This concept is in line with participatory planning theory, which argues that if people are informed early on of the project's development, they do not feel threatened, they are able to consider or predict benefiting from the project, and they are more likely to react positively to the project (McLaren Loring, 2007). This, in turn, could enhance the democratic legitimacy of the processandoutcome(Wells,2009). Wells (2009) categorized factors of a community's acceptance of wind projects into threegroups.Thefirstfactorisproceduraljustice,referringtopublicparticipation.Inother words,publicparticipationisthedegreeofpublicinvolvementinthedevelopmentalphase of the decision-making process, which is not only restricted to consultation, but, in some cases, should include a more direct engagement of citizens. The second factor is distributional justice, referring to the financial and economic concerns of the local community. The equitable distribution of cost and the benefits of a wind project play an important role in public acceptance. This obstacle can be tackled in two ways: compensation (e.g. tax credits) and local or shared ownership. The third factor is trust, a key factor in the decision-making processes. Consulting with the public in siting of wind turbines and receiving information from the local community through transparent communicationareessentialtoaconfidence-buildingprocess. Wind project developers not only need to encourage public participation in the early stagesofwindenergyprojects,butmustalsofindwaystoaddressthestrongnetworksof opponents to these projects (Corscadden et al., 2012; Devine-Wright, 2005; McLaren

10 

Loring, 2007). According to Eltham et al. (2008), collaborative approaches with public involvementindecision-makingareshowntobemoreeffectiveinreducingtheopposition to the project than top-down imposed ones. As wind turbines have a direct and visible impact on the people who live in the local area, local community participation becomes crucialtothepublicacceptanceanddevelopmentoftheproject. Wouters et al. (2011) stipulate that the public should not only be listened to when making decisions that could affect their quality of life, but also the public participation process should reassure the public that their contribution will have an influence on the decision. The needs and interests of all participants should be addressed during the decision-making process and acquired information should be provided to participants througheffectivecommunication.Theoptimumresultsoraconsensusarisefromfulfilling theseprimaryprinciples. The benefits arising from public participation include: improved understanding of stakeholders'expectations;integrationoflayandexpertknowledgetoreachhigher-quality decisions; improved public understanding of the agency's responsibilities and barriers (social,financial,political,andlegal);thecreationofatransformativetoolforsocialchange; reducing conflicts; increasing the likelihood of implementation; greater compliance throughincreasedownershipofasolution;providingtheopportunityforcommunication betweenagenciesthatmakedecisionsandthepublic;anearlywarningsystemforpublic concerns; building trust and improving agency credibility within the community; and educating community about complex technical issues. Finally, public participation can be usedfordistributingaccurateinformationinatimelymanner(Aitken,2009;Aitken,2010;

While the extant literature supports the role of increased public participation in improvingthelikelihoodofpublicacceptanceleadingtowindenergyprojectsuccess,itis important to note that if public participation is not linked to the financial viability of the projectoracontributortoprojectdeploymentsuccess,itisunlikelytomotivatedevelopers to spend money on costly public participation activities (Wright, 2012). Furthermore, public acceptance of a wind energy project can be extremely challenging, if the primary principlesofpublicparticipationarenotmet.

2.1.2.ChallengesofPublicParticipation Whiletherearenumerousadvantagesassociatedwithpublicparticipationinplanningand decision-making processes, the literature notes that there are some challenges. Public participation is time consuming and a poorly-managed public participation process can resultinthelossofcreditability.Powerimbalancesamongparticipants(e.g.thosewhocan affordthetimeandresourcestoparticipate)canbiasdecisions.Insomecases,important expert knowledge can be underemphasized or overlooked. For the developer, allocating resources to the public participation process may leave fewer resources for the project implementation phase and there can be a sense of a loss of decision-making control by officials. Public participation can lead to increased tension between the public and governmentand,insomesituations,implementationoffavorabledecisionsbyauthorities isnotguaranteed(Coenen,2009;IrvinandStansbury,2004;OECD,2009;O'Faircheallaigh, 2010;Woutersetal.,2011). Despiteallofthedrawbacks,citizens'participationindecision-makingprocessesseems inevitable,astheroleofgovernmenthasbeenchangingfromgoverningtogovernance.For the purpose of this paper, governance in the environmental domain refers to the relationships between government and societal actors, which influence environmental decision-making processes. As collaborative relationships increase, there is a need for structural changes and framework modifications by governments to cope with new situations(Savanetal.,2004).   

13 

2.2.CollaborativeDecision-Making Arecentapproachtopublicparticipationiscollaborativeplanning(CP)orcommunicative planning.Thecollaborativebehaviorisstronglydesirableasawaytomanageandresolve conflicts and also for the achievement of integrative agreements (Fisher and Ury, 2011). Forester (1989) and Healey (1997) are pioneers in developing collaborative planning. Allmendinger and Tewdwr (2002, pg. 209) describe the difference between Healey and Forester's work as "Healey's collaborative planning is more concerned with the transformative influence on existing structure, while Forester's communicative planning focusesmoreonagencyandmechanisms,andoutcomesofinterpersonalrelations."Healey (1998)whocoinedtheterm"collaborativeplanning"definesitasacollectiveprocessfor resolvingconflictsandadvancingsharedvisionsinvolvingasetofdiversestakeholders. Collaborativeplanningseekstoinvolvethekey(ifnotall)stakeholdersinthedecisionmakingprocessinordertoachieveconsensualpolicyoutcomesandbalancedsolutionsfor the benefit of all. This is achieved through debate and under the conditions of effective communication.Collaborativeplanningisbasedonaninteractiveandinterpretiveprocess; therefore, interaction, communication, and negotiation among stakeholders are vital elements of CP (Healey, 1998). As highlighted by the literature, effective communication shouldmeetfourcriteria:comprehensibility,sincerity,legitimacy,andtruthfulness(Kumar and Paddison, 2000). Wolsink (2007) also places emphasis on the importance of communicationinthewindenergycontext.Hestatesthataprincipalproblemtobedealt with during the decision-making process on developing wind facilities is communication. Communicationmissesitstargetswhenitdoesnotprovidemeaningfulinformationtothe

14 

public,doesnotaddresstherealconcernsofpeople,anddoesnotprovidethemwithtimely feedback. Since the public is one of the key stakeholders in any large-scale renewable energy project,publicparticipationinafriendlyandsupportiveenvironmentbecomesanessential factor in collaborative planning to ensure full consideration of the public interest. It is important to note that: (1) stakeholders are those who are affected by the planning or decision-making and that they share risks, costs, and benefits; (2) they have a right to participate; and (3) they can affect the decision-making process both negatively and positively.Otherimportantcomponentsofcollaborativeplanningare:integratingdifferent formsofknowledge(e.g.localandexpertknowledge);mutualandsociallearning;criticism with respect; and trust (Kumar and Paddison, 2000). The latter is so important because only trusting stakeholders can begin effective communication toward collaboration. The startingpointissharingmeaningfulinformationamongstakeholdersandgettingfeedback. Trust begins to grow by considering all stakeholders' comments and concerns when choosingalternatives,planning,andmakingafinaldecision. AsindicatedinFigure4,acollaborativeapproachiscomprisedofthreemainphasesof negotiation, in which there are different steps (Day and Gunton, 2003). Negotiation is a powerfulmethodforconflictresolution,whichrequiresspecialskillsandexperience.Itis most frequently deployed when important issues must be agreed upon and is necessary when one party requires the other party's agreement in order to achieve a mutually satisfactoryresolution.Theaimofnegotiationistocreatesharedgoalsorpositionsleading in some cases to long-term relationships (Fisher and Ury, 2011).

Negotiating parties may represent themselves or clients (constituents). Consequently, thenegotiationstructureoftenhasnumeroussetsofplayers,plusattimes,anindependent third party. Lewicki et al. (1992) explain that third parties usually do not have a strong partisan position on the issues in dispute; instead, they attempt to help parties reach a settlement. There are different types of third parties, for instance a mediator, arbitrator, conciliator, or consultant (Wall and Blum, 1991). Regardless of their classification, third partieshaveacommonobjective:toaffectanagreementbetweenthenegotiatingparties. Therearemanyfragmentedstudies(largelybydiscipline)aboutthirdparty'sroleandstyle (refer to section 2.4). However, there is still no universally accepted definition of a third party. Many authors have identified the benefits of adopting a collaborative approach to resolve disputes and to reach a consensus. Table 1 indicates some advantages and

Table1:Advantagesandchallengesofthecollaborativeapproach Advantages Reducing conflicts: collaborative planning is more likely to reach a decision because stakeholders are constructively incorporated into a collaborative process to reach a consensus, instead of remaining as critics outsidetheprocess. Challenges Motivation and skills: all stakeholders (both proponents and opponents) should be motivated to participate. However, the asymmetricaldistributionofnegotiatingskills and technical knowledge can result in inequitableoutcomes.

Creative solutions: integration of local and Representativeness: stakeholder groups expert knowledge may result in more creative willingandabletoparticipateincollaborative alternatives. planningmayrepresentanarrowspectrumof special interests that exclude broader public  interests and can therefore result in biased decisions. Reaching efficient decisions: the broad and diverse group of stakeholders improves the qualityofdecisionsbyincorporatinginterestsof all parties in the final plan. Therefore, solutions to problems are better supported for implementation. Creation of social capital: the development of improved skills, knowledge, and stakeholder relationships that benefit the community in waysbeyondpreparationofthespecificproject. Logistical challenges: organizing a process around a large group of potentially resistant stakeholders requires substantial resources andtime.  Compromise: stakeholders may agree on the second-best solution in order to achieve consensus. In some cases, even important expertknowledgecanbeunderemphasizedor overlooked. A collaborative approach may not be appropriate in many situations that involve fundamentalvalueandbeliefdifferences. 

Increased equity, building trust, improving officials' credibility within the community, and improved public understanding of the agency's responsibilities and limitations are among advantages.

In fact, despite market potential and strong regulatory incentive policies,weakregulatorygovernancethatlimitspublicparticipationtoonlyconsultationis considered the main reason for the challenges in the deployment of wind energy. Largescale projects have been cancelled or delayed and the future of wind energy is becoming uncertain.CancelledprojectsinOntarioincludeKingsbridgeIIinGoderich,HuronCounty, and Blue Highlands wind development in Blue Mountain. Each of these projects received excessive municipal approval delays because of appeals by individuals opposing the development(Wells,2009),ultimatelyresultingintheircancellation.

Thereisagrowingconsensusamongscholarsontheimportanceofpublicparticipation, with the underlying assumption that if citizens become actively involved in the decisionmakingprocess,theoutcomewillbemoreacceptableanddemocratic.Thepublicmaybe involved in the decision-making process in different ways and levels. The lowest level might involve top-down communication and a one-way flow of information between regulators and the public, whereas the higher level is a two-way information exchange, which seeks some degree of public input and more direct involvement. This means that meaningfulinformationshouldbeprovidedtothepublicandtheirfeedbackincorporated intothedecision-makingprocess. RoweandFrewer(2000)highlightthatmoreknowledge-baseddecisionsrequirelower levels of involvement than value-based decisions. The most appropriate method depends onthespecificcircumstancesofeachparticularcase.Thereareavarietyofmethods(see Table 2) that might come under the public participation techniques, ranging from those thatobtaininputintheformofopinions(e.g.publicopinionsurveysandfocusgroups)to those that require judgments and decisions that actually affect decision-making process (e.g.consensusconferencesandcitizens'juries). In determining whether a method will be effective, a variety of contextual and environmental factors interact with the characteristics of a technique to determine effectiveness.Hence,whileonemethodmayworkinonesituation,itmayormaynotwork inanother.Inotherwords,onesizedoesnotfitallinthiscontext.Themainprobleminthe evaluationofparticipationmethodsistheabsenceofaneffectivebenchmarkandconfusion as to what effectiveness really means. Rowe and Frewer (2004) clarify that given the variety of perspectives and interpretations of the participation concept, it is unlikely that

 Since public participation requires substantial resources, authorities may only support public participation programs if it can be demonstrated through evaluation that they are

20 

useful for improving decisions or reducing conflicts. Evaluation is also a learning tool to determine how public participation programs can become more effective in the future. Furthermore,evaluationmakesitpossibletomeasurethegapbetweenplanandpractice.It shows how well government policies regarding public participation correspond to governmentpracticesforinvolvingcitizensinthedecision-makingprocess. The first step in determining if the public participation process is successful is the developmentofacommonsetofevaluativecriteriatoassesstheperformanceofthepublic participation processes. A number of authors have made specific suggestions about the criteria that need to be considered for effective public participation in decision-making processes.Figure5demonstratessomeofthesesuggestedcriteriatopredictandmeasure the effectiveness of public participation (Charnley and Engelbert, 2005; Irvin and Stansbury,2004;OECD,2009;WolsinkandBreukers,2010;Woutersetal.,2011).

This collaborationmaybereachedthroughatrustedthirdparty.Hisorherrolewouldbetoact asabridgebetweenthevariousstakeholdersbyconductingeffectivecommunication-the most important element of a collaborative approach. Many terms that describe this third party are often used interchangeably such as mediator, knowledge-broker, facilitator, boundary spanner, change agent, collaborative entrepreneur, intermediary, arbitrator, conciliator, consultant, and so on. Early studies focused on mediation, arbitration, and

22 

consultation, while more current studies have a more integrated and knowledge-based approachtowardstheunderstandingofthecauses,factors,anddynamicsofconflictitself andtheroleofathirdpartytoresolvetheconflictandreachaconsensus. PartidarioandSheate(2013,pg.27)defineknowledgebrokerageas"amechanismfor transferring research evidence into policy and practice, and as a way of breaking down barriers that impede interaction, healthy communication and collaboration. Through knowledgesharingandexchange,mutuallearningprocessescanbestimulated,increasing thepotentialtobuildcapacityamongstakeholdersandimproveoutcomes."Theknowledge brokerage concept was born in the health sector and rapidly expanded to the business world and environmental field where policy problems are increasingly associated with complexity,uncertainty,andpublicopposition. Cooper (2010) describes that the exact role and function of the third party are conceptualized differently in different sectors and contexts; however, a common key feature is the facilitation of information exchange among various stakeholders. For the purpose of this research, this third party will be referred to as a knowledge-broker and definedasaskilledthirdpartywhoattemptstofacilitatecreativeproblemsolvingthrough communication and analysis, aided by social-scientific knowledge of the conflict. In other words, a knowledge-broker is the catalyst for effective communication who nurtures the relationshipsamongstakeholdersbylinkingthemandprovidingmeaningfulinformation. Information exchange can occur mutually with specific attention to opportunities that maximize the benefit of all stakeholders, which highly depends on the expertise of the knowledge-broker(Choietal.,2005).

However, there is an inherent inequality in this relationship, since the knowledge-broker may have an elevated status due to her/his expertise(Rogers,2003). Bandura (1986) frames the importance of the role of a knowledge-broker in the knowledge transfer process. He believes that knowledge utilization begins when the knowledge-broker establishes a social relationship with the end-users and initiates knowledgeusewithinanetworkofsocialinfluences. Choi etal. (2005) argue that not only the public and policy-makers, but also scientists and politicians have different goals, languages, attitudes toward information, and perception of time. "Important issues affecting their working together include lack of mutualtrustandrespect,differentviewsontheproductionanduseofevidence,different accountabilities,andwhetherthereshouldbealinkbetweenscienceandpolicy"(Choi et al.,2005,pg.632).Inthecaseofwindpowerdevelopmentandwithregardstohealthand ecological concerns, links between scientists and policy-makers appear vital in order to educate people about the health concerns of wind turbines. This may prevent delay or cancellation of negotiated projects, which can significantly impact the economics of a project and discourage investors. The suggested solution is to use a trusted and knowledgeablethirdparty(aswecallhim/herinthisstudy:knowledge-broker)tobridge the gap between policy and academic communities and simplify the information for both

publicandpoliticians.Therefore,asdepictedinFigure6,aknowledge-brokercouldactas anintermediarybetweenthreecommunities:thepublic,politicians,andscientists,inorder tonurturetherelationshipamongstthethreegroupsandserveasacatalystforeffective communication. Hence, it is crucial that the knowledge-broker be well informed and knowledgeableabouttheprojectandtrustedbythecommunity. Another critical role of the knowledge-broker is to translate the demand for evidence (from the public) and retranslate information that comes from either politicians or scientistsinawaythatisunderstandableandtransparent(Choietal.,2005). Inhisstudy,Nishimura(2012)analyzedamulti-streamcollaborativemodel.Thismodel is adjusted to help analyze the collaboration of actors from different sectors in solving environmental issues. He believes a knowledge-broker or collaborative entrepreneur is a critical catalyst in the formation of collaboration in that they provide information that is highlyaccurateandreliable,allowingqualitydecisionstobebasedonqualityinformation. According to Rogers (2003), in the knowledge transfer process, the success of the diffusion of proper ideas and technologies relies on the existence of change agents (knowledge-broker)totackletheconflictsandinfluencethedecision-makingprocessesin adirectiondeemeddesirablebyallstakeholdersinordertoreachaconsensus.Therefore, theyfunctionaslinkageagentsinmovingknowledge,skills,orfact-basedinformationfrom the producer of the knowledge to the users of that knowledge, and conveying feedback fromtheuserstotheproducer.

26 

EnvironmentalScreeningReport(ESR)pursuanttotheElectricityProjectsRegulation(O. Reg.116/01)associatedwiththe EnvironmentalAssessmentAct.Followingthecompletion of an ESR, municipal zoning approval was also required. In some cases, the Canadian EnvironmentalAssessmentAgencydeterminesafederalEA(CEA)onaspecificprojectis required. An environmental assessment under CEAA 2012 (Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012) is required for each project designated by the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change and also projects described in the Regulations DesignatingPhysicalActivities(CEAA,2015). One of the purposes of the EA is to ensure that opportunities are provided for public participation. However, project proponents are mainly responsible for managing public involvementprograms,yethavenoclearguidanceastohowmanagethem.Thereareno criteria or standards available for gauging the adequacy of public involvement programs (SinclairandDiduck,2001).Therefore,publicengagementintheEAistypicallyrestricted to providing public notification about proposed developments and the submission of writtencommentsbytherespondents.Whilethismayseemagoodstartingpointforpublic engagement,inpracticeitisnoteasyforthepublictomakesubstantivecomment(s)about complex technical and scientific issues; this becomes more challenging when information onenvironmentalassessmentisnotavailableinplainlanguage.Evenaftersubmittingtheir comments-despiteallchallengesanddifficulties-thereisnoguaranteethatfeedbackwill beprovidedtoparticipants(Gibsonetal.,2005).

Sustainable decision-making generally involves a range of social,

environmental, economic, political, and ethical factors, which need to be in balance with eachotherinordertoreachaconsensusandinturn,asustainablesociety(Hersh,1999). However, since the introduction of the Environmental Assessment Act, the EA has been a sourceofcriticismanddisappointmentinthisregard.  2.5.2.RenewableEnergyApproval As part of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) established a new Renewable Energy Approval (REA) process. The Renewable Energy Approval Regulation under the Environmental Protection Act (O. Reg.359/09)cameintoforceonSeptember24,2009.TheREAprocesshashadanimpact on the development of wind projects. Only turbines 3 kilowatts (kW) or less are exempt from preparing a REA. Any facility over 50 kW with a sound power rating of 102 dB or greater is required to meet an absolute minimum setback of 550 m from the nearest receptor. Furthermore, the municipal zoning approval is no longer required leaving municipalitiestobeincludedinthegeneralconsultationprocessonly. TheREAregulationisnotanamendmenttothe EnvironmentalAssessmentAct.Itenacts underthe EnvironmentalProtectionAct.Therefore,allwindprojectsareremovedfromthe existing federal-provincial environmental assessment coordination agreement. If a CEA is required,twoseparateanddistinctdocumentsmustbesubmitted.Tomeettheobligations of the REA regulation regarding public engagement, developers only need to provide notifications and hold two public meetings (Figure 8).

ERT is an administrative tribunal established by provincial legislation, which holds hearings and issues decisions, reports, or recommendations based on law, evidence, and a duty to protect the environment (ERT, 2015). The ERT resolves applications and appeals under the following statutes: Environmental Protection Act; EnvironmentalAssessmentAct; CleanWaterAct;EnvironmentalBillofRights; Consolidated Hearings Act; Niagara Escarpment Planning and Development Act (NEPDA); Nutrient ManagementAct; OntarioWaterResourcesAct; PesticidesAct; SafeDrinkingWaterAct;and the Toxics Reduction Act.

As witnessed in Ontario, a regulatory framework that limits public participation to consultation as part of a legal obligation leads to public opposition, a lack of municipal support,subsequentdelays,andtheriskofcancellationofthewindenergyproject.Witha more collaborative approach, where public participation occurs in the early stages of the project,developerscanaddresstheconcernsofthenetworkofopponentspriortofinding themselvesinaprojectwithatightdeadlineandlimitedprogress.Thislatterapproachis consistentwithpracticesinmanyEuropeancountries,particularlyGermany(asaleading jurisdictionintheuseofwindandsolarpowerinEurope),whichhasestablishedastable regulatory framework, based on strong environmental awareness, comprehensive legislation,andpoliticalcommitmentstorenewableenergytargets.Aprojectcancellation emboldens the opposition network (regardless of the merits of their concerns), gives stakeholders a negative perception of the decision-making process, which limits their futureparticipationandrenderstheprocessunsustainable.

2.6.PublicParticipationSpectrum Ashighlightedbytheliterature,publicparticipationisacontinuumoraladderwitheach rung representing a more active role for the public in governance decisions. After reviewing the different typologies of community engagement described in the literature, Arnstein's (1969) ladder of participation appears to be one of the most established and commonly used typologies relevant to examining participation and power in decisionmakingprocessesinenvironmentalgovernance(GreenandKreuter,1999).Itdistinguishes betweenthethreelevels:non-participation,tokenism,andcitizenpower.Non-participation is a substitute for genuine participation. In other words, the objective of this level is to enable power-holders to educate or cure participants rather than involving them in planninganddecision-makingprocesses.Tokenismreferstoactionssuchasinformingand consultation; this provides the opportunity for participants to hear and to be heard; however, there is no assurance of feedback and possible changes. Citizen power involves partnership,powerdelegation,andcitizencontrol;atthislevel,citizenscannegotiatewith power-holdersandhavemanagerialpowertomakedecisions. The principal difference between collaborative planning and the other participatory methods is that CP is based on a higher level of collaboration and involvement of stakeholdersthroughatwo-waycommunicationandface-to-facenegotiationsinorderto reachaconsensusagreementandresolvedisputes(DayandGunton,2003).Itseemsthat the collaborative planning fits well within the rungs of Arnstein's (1969) ladder of participation, because it allows for increased participation by citizens. Collaborative planning matches with the "citizen power" level of Arnstein's ladder (Allmendinger and Tewdwr, 2002). In collaborative planning, depending on the regulatory governance, the

32 

range of stakeholders who are involved and the power relations among them, different rungsoftheparticipatoryladdermightbereached-frompartnershiptocitizencontrol. Arnstein(1969)suggeststhatthereisasignificantdifferencebetweengivingpeoplethe feeling of involvement (while little or nothing has actually changed) and real empowerment, with the former allowing those who hold the decision-making power to claim that all stakeholders were considered. Arnstein explains different levels of participationusingatypologyofeightlevelsofparticipation,arrangedinaladderpattern witheachrungrepresentingthelevelofcitizens'powerinthedecision-makingprocesses.

Based on Arnstein's ladder of participation, the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) developed a public participation spectrum with different levels of publicparticipationinthedecision-makingprocess(Figure9).

Thepublicparticipationspectrumbeginswiththesimpleprovisionofinformationtothe public. The next two levels of "consult" and "involve" include formal consultation to considerpublicviewswiththefinaldecisiontobemadebypublicofficials.Attheendofthe spectrum, "collaborate" and "empower" require a higher level of co-operation, shared goals,andjointdecision-making.Ateachlevel,publicparticipationgoalswillbeachieved byselectingoneoftheparticipationtechniquesdescribedinTable2. Underthismodel,almostallwindenergystakeholdersacceptthatpublicparticipation isinevitable,butthedebateremainsaboutatwhatleveloftheparticipationspectrumthe public should be included. For instance, in Canada, both the federal and provincial governments publicly acknowledge the importance of public input in the environmental management process; however, in practice a limited role for public stakeholders is provided. The only legally regulated mechanisms for public participation are the EnvironmentalAssessment(EA)andRenewableEnergyApproval(REA)process (Wright,
34 

2012). Both processes require public participation in limited circumstances and at the lower end of the participation spectrum (mostly "inform" and "consult") through public commentperiodsandpublicmeetings(Wright,2012).  2.7.RecommendedConceptualFramework Accordingtoprominentauthorsinthecasestudyfield(Eisenhardt1989;Stake,1995;Yin 2009),thedevelopmentofaconceptualframeworkisanessentialstepinresearchdesign. The goal is to provide a blueprint for the study to guide the research, facilitate data collection and data analysis, and help the analytic generalizability. The conceptual framework serves different purposes, for instance, to identify who will and will not be included in the study or to describe what relationships may be present based on logic, theory, and/or experience and to provide the researcher with the opportunity to define unitsofanalysis(BaxterandJack,2008). Thefirstdraftoftheproposedconceptualframework(Figure10)wasorganizedaround theproceduralstepsofwindprojectdevelopmentinOntario(GipeandMurphy,2005),the role of the third party or knowledge-broker, and the main components of the public participationspectrum(inspiredbyIAP2,2004).Itisimportanttoemphasizethatdifferent levels of participation are possible. The spectrum of participation begins with providing information to the public and ends with public empowerment that places final decisionmaking in the hands of the public. Developing a conceptual framework for this research wasanattemptto:(1)explorewhereonthespectrumpublicengagementinwindenergy development in Ontario falls; (2) explore possible ways for stakeholders to climb the ladderofparticipation,fromsimplyprovidinginformationtoenteringintoacollaboration;

35 

and (3) explore the role of the knowledge-broker in climbing the ladder of participation. The framework continued to develop as the study progressed and the relationships between the proposed constructs emerged as data was analyzed. Section 4.4 provides detailedinformationonthemodifications.

In this framework, the public engagement process starts with carrying out a stakeholder'sanalysisaimedattheidentificationofthemainactorsinthedecision-making process, followed by a social network analysis in order to understand the interactions between stakeholders. These two initial steps help explore the existing conflicts and identifyapreliminarylistofpossiblesolutions(alternativeoptions).Inordertoreachan agreement, there is a need to re-sort research material, assessment results, and information, so as to package it in a user-friendly manner.

3.1.ResearchApproach Qualitative methodologies categorize, analyze, and evaluate information related to the quality,and/orcharacterofthesubjectbeingstudied.Inotherwords,qualitativeresearch tries to provide an understanding and explanation of human behavior and social interactions(Silverman,1997). A qualitative paradigm has been chosen for this study because it fits with most qualitative research assumptions including: the researcher is the primary instrument for datacollectionandanalysis;thisstudyisconcernedprimarilywithaprocessratherthan outcomesorproducts;anditisinterestedinmeaning:howpeoplemakesenseoftheirlives andthestructureoftheirworld(Silverman,1997). This study is exploring the nature of a particular contemporary social phenomenon (public participation) within its real-life context, the researcher is dealing with unstructured data, and a particular setting is being studied in detail within a case study scenario. Therefore, case study research methodology seemed the best match for this study.Table3,summarizestheresultsofcomparisonsmadebyHiscock(2012)onresearch criteriathatbenefitfromcasestudymethodology,asopposedtootherresearchmethods.

Conducting interviews within this case is a powerful way to gain insight into wind project development barriers and other social issuesthroughunderstandingtheexperienceoftheindividualswhoseexperiencesreflect those issues (Seidman, 2006). As King and Horrocks (2010) state, the interview research methodisanessentialtoolforthecollectionofdatainsocialresearchasitisallaboutthe direct systematic conversation between an interviewer and the respondent. By this, the interviewer is able to obtain relevant information for a particular research problem both extensivelyandintensively,andexchangethedataandexperiences.Theaimofthisstudyis tocaptureaspectsofthesocialworld,butthisisdoneinwaysthatdonotrelyonnumbers as the unit of analysis. As King and Horrocks (2010, pg. 7) explain, "using the term qualitative interviewing situates the methodology and method deliberately within the qualitative domain where a broad and holistic approach is taken to the study of social phenomena". The focus of research was to uncover how people feel about the wind farm

development and to make sense of their lives from their particular vantage points. Therefore,qualitativeinterviewingwasundertaken.Asummaryofresearchmethodology isindicatedinFigure11:

3.2.ResearchDesign Aspreviouslymentioned,byfollowingtheYin(2009)selectioncriteria,casestudyresearch methodologywaschosenforthisstudymainlybecause:(1)ofthetypeofresearchquestion (the focus of the study is to answer "how" questions); (2) the investigator did not have control over actual behavioral events, in other words she/he cannot manipulate the behaviorofthoseinvolvedinthestudy;(3)thestudyisaboutacontemporaryasopposed tohistoricalevent;(4)theresearchisanin-depthstudyofasocialphenomenoninitsreal lifecontext;(5)theboundariesarenotclearbetweenthephenomenonanditscontext;(6) there are few studies that explore the role of a third party in resolving stakeholders conflicts in wind projects and the case study method is a highly relevant approach for exploratoryandcontext-dependentresearch. The selection of a specific type of case study (exploratory, explanatory, or descriptive) wasguidedbytheoverallstudypurpose,whichisexploratory.Theexploratorycasestudy isused"toexplorethosesituationsinwhichtheinterventionbeingevaluatedhasnoclear, single set outcomes" (Yin, 2003, pg. 15). Gagnon (2010) highlights that the case method seeks to systematically infer meaning from the events they observe, but this does not necessarily mean they have initial ideas and conceptions about the research question. Therefore,anexploratorystudydealswithasubjectthatisclearlyimportant,buthasnot been previously studied and there is not enough experience or information from the literature. Following Yin (2009) and Gagnon (2010), a multiple case study approach was selected:(1)toexploreandunderstandthesimilaritiesanddifferenceswithinandbetween cases;(2)toreacheitherdirect(predictsimilarresults)ortheoreticalreplication(predict contrastingresultsbutforpredictablereasons);(3)tomakeitpossibletodrawconclusion

41 

fromasetofcases;and(4)toprovidearichdescriptionofthecontextinwhichtheevents occurandtorevealtheunderlyingstructureofsocialbehavior.Yin(2003)statesthatthe evidence from multiple cases is often considered more compelling. Multiple case studies addtotherichnessofdataandenhancetheconfidenceinfindings.Inthefaceofanalytic benefits and to avoid the vulnerability of single-case design (putting all the eggs in one basket),thegoalinthisresearchwastohaveatleasttwocasestostudy. The nature of the problem and the attributes of the conceptual framework, which is inspired by the current literature on the subject, lend themselves to an embedded case designthatallowsformultipleunitsofanalysis(Yin,2009).Theembeddeddesignfeatures a single context, which for this research is the Ontario wind energy sector. In addition to matching the framework perspectives - which is developed based on the literature and lessons learned from the current cases - the embedded case design also improves the sensitivity of the case study to emerging themes as the research is conducted. Following Yin's (2009) advice, selecting an embedded case study design helps focus the case study inquiry by using subunits of analysis and avoiding slippage in the nature of the study. Therefore,definingtheunitsofanalysishelpstodesigntheresearchquestions.Moreover, the subunits can often add significant opportunities for extensive analysis and enhance insightintothecase.ThebasicunitsofanalysisareshowninFigure12.

3.3.DataCollection Thegeneralprocessofconstructingcasestudiesbeginsbyassemblingtherawcasedata, constructing a case record of categorized information, then writing the final case study narrative (Patton, 2002). To maximize the contrast between opponents and proponents' perspectives, data was collected from each perspective in two separate stages. The collectionstartedwiththedevelopersandpublicofficials'perspective-atthemunicipality level-inordertogainabroadandcomprehensiveunderstandingoftheenvironmentthat theopponentactors/groupsexistwithin.Thatwaythecollectionandanalysisofdatawas more targeted along specific lines of enquiry related to the realities of wind project development,andtonotspendasmuchtimeandeffortonlearningaboutthestructureof the market environment. Therefore, interviews were directed at municipality officials (planning or renewable energy project managers), developers (wind project or public relation managers), involved third parties (consultant and facilitators), and opposition groups(chairmanorspokesperson)orindividuals.Aninterviewwithaknowledge-broker wasnotpossible,asthereisnosuchroledefinedinthedecision-makingprocessofwind

The perspective of the public officials at a provincial level (Ministry of Environment and ClimateChange)isincorporatedintothestudythroughanalyzingavailabledocumentsand approvals. Uniquecharacteristicsofqualitativeinterviewingweretemptingenoughtobepickedas adatacollectiontechnique.Theinterviewtechniquesarebothdescriptiveandexploratory tools. In its description function, information received from the respondent provided insight into the nature of social reality. At the same time, the interview was used as an explorationtoolthatprovidesinsightintounexploreddimensionsoftheproblem(Kingand Horrocks,2010). The definitions of the interview method given by scholars present the interview as a good fit and worthy technique for data collection. Cannell and Kahn (1968) defined an interview as "a two-person conversation, initiated by the interviewer for the specific purpose of obtaining research-relevant information and focused by him on the content specifiedbytheresearchobjectivesofdescriptionandexplanation"(citedbyCohen etal., 2000,pg.269).Therefore,aninterviewisacontrolledconversationwheretheinterviewer obtains data required for the survey from the respondent by asking serious questions verbally.Duringthecourseoftheinterview,nonverbalmessagesarealsopresentandneed to be interpreted. Complex cognitive, affective, and social feelings are involved in interviews (Cohen et al., 2000). This helps to understand and categorize conflicts and concernsofdifferentstakeholders. In order to benefit from advantages of both structured interviews and unstructured interviews and to overcome shortcomings of these methods, a semi-structured interview

44 

was selected for this study. Table 4 demonstrates some advantages and disadvantages of eachmethodbasedonHolsteinandGubrium's(2001)work.Thecollaborativeframework provides specific lines of questioning which have been incorporated into the interview guideincasestudyprotocol(Appendix1).

 To reveal the common narratives, representatives of key stakeholder groups were interviewed.Intotal,22interviews(averaging50minuteseach)wereconductedofOntario windindustryactors(Table5).Therewere5interviewswithmunicipalities,7interviews with the consultant/facilitators, 5 interviews with the proponents (developers, Canadian WindEnergyAssociation(CanWEA),andtheformerMinisterofEnergyandInfrastructure whopresentedtheGreenEnergyandGreenEconomyActin2009,and5interviewswiththe opponents (Wind Concerns Ontario (WCO) and the local residents). In addition, 2 opponents emailed their thoughts on wind energy development making a total of 24 subjectswhoprovideddataforthisstudy.Ofthe22interviews,notesweretakenforone

Prior to the interviews, the researcher fulfilled all the requirementsoftheRyersonEthicsBoardforresearchinvolvinghumanparticipants.This included the following: obtaining a signed consent form from participants that explained the purpose and benefits of the research; the voluntary nature of the participation; the right to withdraw or not to answer a specific question; and confidentiality (refer to Appendix 2 for a sample of the consent form). The Ryerson Ethics Board approval was receivedonDecember5,2013andrenewedonNovember17,2014.

 Interviews were conducted from June 2014 to June 2015. The researcher drafted and sentanemailtopotentialparticipants.Afterrepeatedcorrespondence(emailsandphone calls) to 109 individuals, eventually 22 interviews were obtained. Unfortunately, the balance of potential participants did not respond or declined to contribute. Therefore, in some cases the researcher had to use the snowball sampling or respondent-driven

46 

sampling where existing participants recommend future participants from among their acquaintances(SalganikandHeckathorn,2004). Interviews used a semi-structured approach in which questions elicited descriptions and long answers rather than single words or sentences. Primary question order and follow-upquestionswerebasedontherespondent'soriginalanswers. Inordertocross-examinethefindingsofinterviewsandassessreliability,twopublic meetingsforproposedprojectswereobserved(Table6).

 3.4.CaseSelection 3.4.1.SelectionCriteria Selection of cases is an important aspect of conducting case studies. Random selection is notapreferableapproach,becausethetotalnumberofcaseswhichcanusuallybestudied is limited. Flyvbjerg (2006) states that the strategic choice of a case would help the generalizabilityofcasestudies.Theideaisnottoformastatisticallyrepresentativesample

ofpopulation,butrathertofindthemostinformativecasetoassistintheformationofan analyticortheoreticalgeneralization.Thelatterdependsonusingatheoreticalframework toestablishalogicthatmightbeapplicabletotheothersituations(Yin,2009).Inanalytic generalization, a previously developed theory is used as a template to compare with the results of the current case study to see if the data supports the developed theory. As previouslymentioned,thefirststepinvolvesdevelopingaconceptualframeworktoshow howthestudyfindingshaveguidedtherelationshipbetweentheparticularelementsand concepts of the initial conceptual framework (Yin, 2009). Hence, the goal of theoretical sampling is to choose cases that are replicable or extend theory to a broader range (Eisenhardt, 1989). Following suggestions by leading authors in this field, the case selectionwasbasedonthesecriteria: Â· Conduct screening procedure by consulting with knowledgeable people and/or collectingrelevantdatafromarchivalsources(Yin,2003) Â· Pragmaticconsiderations,i.e.feasibility,accessibility,andavailabledata(Seawright andGerring,2008;Yin,2009) Â· Sample variation or the presence of several mini-cases within a case (Eisenhardt, 1989;Flyvbjerg2006;GeorgeandMcKeown,1985) Â· Deliberate theoretical sampling plan, i.e. choosing polar types relevant to research questions(Eisenhardt,1989;SeawrightandGerring,2008) Â· Potentialtocollaboratewiththestakeholders(Yin,2009)

Therefore, this study focused on the developers who are experienced in public participation and have developed projects in Ontario. To fulfill the requirements of deliberate theoretical sampling, polar types of cases were chosen. One is a large wind

The researcher stopped repeating the cycle when the theoretical saturation was reached. Theoretical saturation is the point at which the incrementalimprovementisminimal(Eisenhardt1989).

Cross-caseanalysisappliesspecificallytotheanalysisofmultiplecases.Thistechnique was used in this research to find cross-case patterns. Yin (2009) suggests starting the cross-case analysis by analyzing each case separately, then using tables in a uniform frameworkforeachcasetofindthesimilarities,differences,andoveralltrend.Thefindings of such an analysis is likely to be more robust. There is a challenge associated with this technique, as the examination of word tables relies on argumentative interpretation, not numeric properties. Therefore, the investigator should know how to develop strong, plausible,andfairarguments. Contentanalysiswasrequiredtomakesenseoftextdata(i.e.interviews,observations, ordocuments).Contentanalysisisconcernedwiththeinterpretationoftextdatathrough the systematic classification process of coding and identifying themes or patterns. Patton (2002)describesthatpatternandthemecouldbeusedinterchangeably;however,pattern refers to descriptive findings and theme takes a more categorical or topical form. The codingprocessstartswithorganizinglargequantitiesoftextintocategories.Categoriesare patterns or themes that are directly expressed in the text or are derived from the text

throughanalysis.Thenextstepwastoidentifyrelationshipsamongcategories(Hsiehand Shannon,2005).Contentanalysisprovidesinsightintocomplexmodelsofhumanthought and language use. However, it is challenging to simplify the text and develop a coding scheme.Moreover,theinvestigatorneedstobemindfulwheninterpretingtheresultsusing automated content analysis (using computer assisted tools) and be cognizant of possible interpretivebiasbytheresearcher(TrochimandDonnelly,2008). Hsieh and Shannon (2005) describe three main approaches of content analysis: conventionalcontentanalysis,directedcontentanalysis,andsummativecontentanalysis. Thekeydifferenceamongtheseapproachesisthecodingsystemutilized.Inaconventional content analysis, categories are derived from data during data analysis. In a directed contentanalysis,theresearcherusesexistingtheoryorpriorresearchtodeveloptheinitial codingscheme.Asanalysisproceeds,additionalcodesaredevelopedandtheinitialcoding scheme is modified. Researchers employing a directed approach can extend or refine existing theory. A summative approach deals with identifying and quantifying certain wordsorcontentintextwiththepurposeofunderstandingthecontextualuseofthewords orcontent(HsiehandShannon,2005). Acombinationofallthreemethodswasusedtogetthemostoutoftheresearchdata. First, the directed content analysis was used for this study because the goal of directed contentanalysisistovalidateorconceptuallyextendatheoreticalframework(Hsiehand Shannon, 2005). The suggested theoretical framework (section 2.7) provided the initial codingscheme,helpedfocustheresearchquestions,andguidedthediscussionoffindings. However, because of the exploratory approach of the research, codes began to emerge when reading the interview transcripts (conventional content analysis). Due to the

59 

collection of a high volume of data, it was important to stay focused on the main topics; therefore,asummativeapproachofcontentanalysiswasdeployedtorefinethekeypoints. In summary, as Figure 21 indicates, the first stage of the research involved the completion of an extensive literature survey of issues related to the role of public participation and the knowledge-broker in wind project development. This was followed byformulationofaconceptualframeworkasastructureforthestudy.Datawascollected throughqualitativeinterviewing,documents,andthecasemeetingobservation.Observing the public hearing meeting of in-progress projects served as a means of assessment for reliability, i.e. the appearance of conceptual or theoretical coherence with the developed framework.

ThissectionexplainsthepublicparticipationprocessforwindenergyprojectsinOntario usingtwocases.Aspreviouslymentioned,theselectionofspecificcaseswasguidedbythe following criteria: the projects were recently finished (Summerhaven, GRW, PDNW, and ErnestownWindPark)orareunderway(theonlyprojectinprogressistheNRWF);there was available information through interviews, reports, and documents; the presence of a value/interest conflict; and clear traces of public involvement. To this comparative analysis, the conceptualization of public participation based on collaborative decisionmakingwasapplied. In order to define the main themes, broad brush coding was utilized to organize the materialintotopicareasbasedontheconceptualframeworkandresearchquestions.The codingfocusedonfivemajordomainsofthepublicparticipationspectrum:inform,consult, involve, collaborate and empower. Since this research takes an exploratory approach to identifyingthefactorswhichwereinfluentialinformingbeliefs,attitudes,andinteractions during the development of the wind projects, codes were created when reading the interview transcriptions (see Appendix 3 for more information on the coding). Based on the defined codes, a set of statements that would present the entire opinion domain was formulated. The statements included diverse viewpoints on the main concepts or themes presentwithintherealmoftheresearch. Notes from observations and interview transcription were organized using theme coding by the qualitative software, NVivo. Most text was coded only once, but some text wasmultiplecoded.Sixty-eightcodes(ornodesascalledinNVivo)wereestablished and then refined to the final list of main topics including nineteen statements. The changes

62 

during analysis include the collapsing of codes into each other and making child codes, finding some codes fell more naturally within different domains, and recoding texts. It is importanttohighlightthatthemeidentificationdoesnotproduceauniquesolution,which means"thereisnosinglesetofcategoriesorthemeswaitingtobediscovered.Thereareas many ways of seeing the data as one can invent.

In the following section, the main topics in connection with the core question and current situation of public engagement in wind project development in Ontario are discussed, followed by the main themes based on the research sub-questions. In the concluding section, the relevance of the recommended conceptualization for a more generalunderstandingofsocialsupportandresistanceindeploymentofwindpower,the future of the wind industry and the recommended participatory techniques by the participants,andrelatedregulatorypolicychangerequirementsarediscussed.  4.1.ThemesRelatedtotheCoreQuestion This section discusses the findings from analyzing data - mainly interviews and in some cases the documents and notes from meeting observations. It is organized by the main topicsraisedbytherespondentsortopicsthatstoodoutfromthedocumentsbasedonthe

63 

fivelevelsofpublicparticipationspectrumintheconceptualframework.However,thereis no definite border between these five levels of participation under which the research resultscouldfall.Forinstance,therearetopicsrelatedto"inform"whicharediscussedin the "consult" section. The purpose of this section is to reveal the reality of public consultation in wind project development in general and the selected cases in particular. Therefore, discussed topics are not necessarily affecting the elements of the conceptual frameworkinapositiveway. Unless noted otherwise, points described here were made by more than one person, even if only a single illustrative quotation is used to make the point, thereby avoiding lengthy quotes with similar content. Quotations have been presented verbatim, each identified with a code of two letters for the pseudonym initials of the respondents and a number representing the question number to ensure the identities of all participants remainanonymous.  4.1.1.Inform NIMBY:HurtfulorTruthful? Asindicatedearlier,generallytheacceptanceofwindenergyremainshigh,butwhenlocal stakeholdersareinformedaboutspecificwinddevelopmentstheyareoftenopposed.One ofthemostcommonlyreferredtoexplanationsforthisgapinattitudeshasbeentheNIMBY phenomenon.Duringtheinterviews,theopponentstowindpowerdevelopmentcriticized theuseofthetermNIMBY.Thisisconsistentwiththescholars'viewontheuseofNIMBY in the explanation of public perceptions of wind energy (Bell etal., 2005; Haggett, 2011; vanderHorst,2007;Wolsink,2000).Forinstance,Belletal.(2005)arguedthattheNIMBY

64 

concept fails to reflect the complexity of human motives and their interaction with social and political institutions. On the other hand, there will always be additional factors influencingattitudesthatareuniquetoalocale. The NIMBY explanation was mentioned by the respondents, mostly proponents; whereas opponents found this term insulting to the local communities. Both sides have legitimate claims regarding NIMBYism. Thus, it has become important to consider both sidesofthisargument,aswellasthosewhofindthemselvesinbetween.Thefollowingare somepossibleexplanationsoftheNIMBYsyndrome: 1.Place-protectiveaction Devine-Wright (2009) argues that NIMBY responses should be re-defined as placeprotective actions, which are founded upon the notion of place attachment and place identity. Emotional attachments to place are essential and any disruption to those attachmentscanaffectanindividual'sattitudeandaltertheirbehavior.Thisisparticularly trueforwindturbineswhicharevisibleonthelandscape.Asthisparticipantexplains: J.F.4: "The first concern is we live on a lakeshore which is world renowned for its beauty and so to a large extent is still unspoiled wilderness. Now it is not pristine anymorebecauseobviouslywehaveroadsandtelephonelines,electricallinesand soforth.Sowe'renotmakingtheclaimthatit'spristine.Butwe'resayingthatit's largely unspoiled wilderness to which hundreds if not thousands of visitors come everyyear..."  2.Democraticdeficitexplanation Notablestudies(Belletal.,2005;Toke,2002;Wolsink2000)claimthatwhileopinionpolls showthatthemajorityofpeopleareinfavorofwindpower,theminoritywhoopposewind powercontrolparticularwindprojectdevelopmentdecision-makingprocesses.Generally, people do not come forward with positive responses to developers' agendas. This was evidentfromobservingthepublicmeetings/openhouses.Residentswhohadverystrong

views(negative)regardingwindenergyweremorelikelytocometotheopenhousesthan those with more passive views. Interestingly, this explanation repeatedly came up in the interviewswiththeproponentandfacilitator/consultants: K.A.2:"Unfortunatelyaverysmallanti[wind]grouporNIMBYgroupmakesalot morenoisethanpeoplewhojustdon'tsayanythingorlikeitbuttheyhavetheirlife togetonwithandaren'tgoingtocomeout.It'smucheasiertogetpeopletocome outandyellagainstyou.Soyouhavetogaugedoesitmakesensetofightthis."

Those people believe that wind energy is a good idea, but they also believe there are general limits and controls (regarding the impact of developments on landscape, humans, and the nature) that should be placed on its development.

Bell et al. (2005) admit that it is not easy to differentiate between people motivated by self-interest and those who genuinely hold a general principle of qualified support. Correspondingly, this participantdescribes: R.S.7:"...reallyI'dsaythebiggestthingwashumanhealthandthesecondthingwas thereweresomeconcernsaroundbirdsandbatsbutingeneralIdon'tbelievethat wasatrueconcernformostpeople,itwasapoliticaltactic,butdefinitelytherewas onepersonatleastwhowastrulyconcernedforbirdsandbatsandactingfromthe verybeginning.ThiswasapersonwhoisinvolvedinconservationandIthinkthat wasquitelegitimate..."   4.1.2.Consult PublicConsultation 1.CLCmeetings As a condition of the REA, developers are required to establish community liaison committees(CLC)withinthreemonthsofreceivingtheREAtoprovideaforumtoexchange ideas,shareinformation,andprovideupdatesontheconstruction,installation,operation, maintenance,andretirementoftheprojectwithinterestedresidentsandmembersofthe public. The CLC meeting should operate for a minimum of two years after the day it is established. Members should meet at least two times per year with the membership comprisedofalimitednumberofparticipantswhoareselectedbasedoncertaincriteria.

67 

These criteria narrow down the eligible population who can volunteer to serve on the committee. The following criteria were found on the developers' website (e.g. Ostrander Point Wind Energy Park): previous experience in contributing to local advisory committees; renewable energy knowledge; and a technical, science, or engineering based background or work experience. All projects had facilitators to run community liaison committeemeetings.Theyalsohadconsultants(i.e.environmentalplanners)whohelped developers put together the renewable energy proposal and prepare related reports (e.g. noise impact assessment report, water assessment report, natural heritage report, archeologicalreport,etc.).However,theroleofthesethirdpartieswaslimitedanddidnot gobeyondfacilitationorconsultation. TheCLCusuallyconsistsofupto14individualswhoarerepresentativesofthefollowing groups: landowners; residents within 1 km of the Project; Aboriginal communities; agriculture; business/industry; environment and local organizations; and representatives fromgovernmentagencies.Allmembersarerequiredtofillouttheapplicationandtoread andsigntheTermsofMembershipAgreement.CLCmeetingsareopentothepublicforthe purpose of observing the conversation (adopted from CLC notices of the illustrative projects,seetheAppendix5).However,CLCmeetingsdonotincludemattersraisedduring the proposal/planning stage for the project (e.g. location of a wind turbines or issues/concernsalreadyaddressedthroughtheREAprocess).Therefore,CLCnoticesgive the impression that they are rubberstamp committees in which public participation remainssurficialatbest.Oneoftheparticipantsexplainsthis: W.B.6:"Thescopeofthesemeetingstalksaboutthingsinpostdecision-making.So you aren't revisiting the approval process...Now we're moving on...

72 

3.Localknowledge These opinions demonstrate a need for different forms of involvement (procedure and method are crucial), which should occur during the early stages of the process. Several participantsinresponsetothequestion:"Whataresomestrategiesthatcouldbeadopted forincreasingthelevelofpublicparticipation?"statedthatitismoreaboutthetimingof participation;insteadofhavingithappenonceaprojectisdecidedandthenannouncingto peoplewhatisgoingtobedone,thedevelopersneedtobackthatupandhaveparticipation earlier in the process which would facilitate a smoother project process. As indicated by the respondents, this early involvement and acknowledging the democratic right of the local community have two main benefits: decreasing the level of public opposition and taking advantage of local knowledge. Citizens can be used as local experts and fully engaging them in decision-making canprovidedeveloperswitha rich and contextualized knowledgeofthelocalarea,itspeople,andthearea'spoliticaldynamics: N.B.15: "if you treat the community with respect and you are honest and upfront with them, they may not like what you have to say and how things are unfolding. Typicallytheyaregoingtounderstandwhyit'sunfoldingthatway."  And E.L.14: "The more people provide the input [early], the more ownership or more involvedtheyfeelintheprocessandIthinkmostacceptingtheycanbecomeofthe project.But,itisalsosoimportantbecauseusuallywhenthesecompaniescomein, they are outsiders. We don't know the area and it is important getting people involvedandhavingtheinformation.Theycantellusstuff,wedidn'tknowabout. You know, for example, an unregistered airstrip.

So,theycanpointoutthingsthatwemightnotknowabout."  Similarly:  J.L.19: "...like the developer doesn't necessarily live here and hasn't lived here. We arepeoplewhohavelivedhereforsome,150yearsthroughtheirfamilies.Sothey

know the area. They have lived here. They know what happens. So that type of public participation [early engagement] is really beneficial to both the public and the developer because they can sort of iron out any detail, anything they may be missingorthatmayenhancethings."  Therefore, decisions that do not take into account local factors, concerns, and values mayraisequestions,facepublicopposition,leadtopoorlydevelopedplansthathavetobe reworkedinordertofixflaws,andimportantly,fueldistrust.Theseissuescanberesolved withcollaborativedecision-making,whichconsidersknowledgeassociallysituatedrather thanmerelythedomainofthetechnicalorscientificformofknowledge. 4.Possibleconsequences What respondents describe above exemplifies the influence of two key dimensions and concepts related to wind energy decision-making process: transparency and early involvement.Onecouldarguethatopenconsultation,participation,andthesocialimpact onthelocalitiesnevertookplace.Rather,asindicatedbysomerespondents,theseprojects were planned by the developers many years in advance as a part of the REA strategy. However,insomecasesthedeveloperspaidapriceforthisinadequateconsultationbyway ofsubstantialdelaysinimplementationduetoappealsthroughtheEnvironmentalReview Tribunalprocessorwhendealingwiththemotionspassedbymunicipalities.Anexampleis the North Frontenac case in which the researcher participated in order to observe the dynamics. On June 6, 2015, the North Frontenac Council held a special council public meeting about a proposed wind project by NextEra. Representatives from NextEra explained their plan and answered questions from the Council. Few questions from the public were answered by the NextEra representatives. However, as soon as questions becamemorechallengingandcontroversialtopicswerebroughttothefore,somepeople started to seriously question the provided documents (questions, based on observation,
74 

werenotansweredadequately).Thedeveloperrepresentativesthenchangedtheformatof themeeting(wheretheywerestandinginfrontoftheroomfullofconcernedcitizensand werebarragedwithquestions)toanopenhouseformatwithposters.Theoppositiongroup wasdistributingleaflets(Appendix6)outsidetheCommunityHallanditsmemberswere encouragingpeopletosignapetitionagainstthedeveloper. On June 10th, North Frontenac Council passed a resolution declaring the township an "unwillinghost"fortheNextErawindpowerprojects.Thecompanyhadoffereda$200,000 per year for 20 years community vibrancy fund in addition to a projected increase in tax revenueofmorethan$100,000peryearunderonecondition:thetownshipneededtopass a motion supporting the project, thereby enabling the company to secure community support points and win the bid in the procurement process, which had been set out by Ontario'sIndependentElectricitySystemOperator(IESO).InaninterviewwithFrontenac News,theMayorexplainedthemotivesbehindthemotion: "There were many red flags about this proposal as far as North Frontenac is concerned,startingwiththefactthatinsteadofbeingapproachedbythecompany we initially read about it in the newspaper in early March. It also involves major construction and conflicts with the entirely different economic development strategywehavebeendeveloping,andbeyondthatourresidentshavevoicedtheir oppositioninlargenumbers."  The NextEra bid to the IESO can proceed without municipal support; however, the statement that North Frontenac is not a willing host will cost NextEra valuable ranking points in the procurement process, which will make it difficult for them to compete with biddersin"willing"townships.IfNextErastillwinsthebid,theturbineswouldbebuiltin NorthFrontenac.InthatcaseallthatNorthFrontenacCouncilwillhaveaccomplishedby statingtheywere"notawillinghost"willbetoloseupto$10millioninrevenueover20 years.InMarch2015,theIESOlauncheditsnewLargeRenewableProcurement(LRP).The
75 

LRP is an effort to improve the public consultation process and strike a balance between early community engagement and financial viability of projects. Proposed projects must "demonstrate site and resource due diligence" as well community engagement (IESOb, 2015).Whetherornotthesechangescanbeconsideredimprovementintheparticipatory processisdiscussedinthenextsection.

RFP) is a competitive process for procuring large renewable energy projects generally larger than 500 kW andupto300MWofOn-ShoreWind,140MWofSolar,50MWofBioenergy,and75MWofWaterpower.In order to proceed, renewable energy projects in Ontario need to be awarded long-term contracts with the IndependentElectricitySystemOperator.Oncethiscontractisawarded,andpriortothecommencementof construction, the projects are subject to approval (REA) from MOECC.  On March 10, 2015, Ontario's new procurement process for large-scale renewable power projects was publically released. The municipal, Aboriginal, and stakeholder engagement activities are included in this new Large Renewable Procurement Process. For each Renewable Energy Proposal, a registered proponent must have a publically accessible websitefortheLargeRenewableProjectonwhichtheregisteredproponentoritsrepresentativehasposted the project's documents. The proponent should make sure the Large Renewable Project website is and remainsavailableandpublicallyaccessiblefromthedatethatisatleast15dayspriortothedateofthepublic communitymeeting.Section3.2.5.ofthisnewprocessisdedicatedtocommunityengagement.Atleastone publiccommunitymeetingmustbeheldtodiscussLargeRenewableProjectswithmembersofthepublicin eachoftheprojectcommunitiesandonemeetingmustbeheldwiththepublicofficials(IESOc,2015).

Furthermore, as previously mentioned, people with positive or laissez-faire responses (silent majority) generally do not come forward to support wind project development. Hence,theminoritywhoopposewindpowercancontrolthedecision-makingprocess.As some participants pointed out, sometimes opponents who have already made up their mind are not necessarily from the area, they are just against wind projects. There is a stronganti-windnetworkinOntario;theytravelaroundtheprovincetosupportanti-wind groupsindifferentareas. V.F.6: "There was a public meeting and there were protesters outside the public

At the stage of contacting the potential interviewees, an email (Appendix 7) was receivedfromthespokespersonofanoppositiongroupwhichendorsedthededicationof anti-windgroupstoputanendtothewindenergydevelopmentinOntario.Shedeclinedto be interviewed because she believed that university-driven research rests on false premisessuchaswindprovidingagoodsubstituteforfossilfuelsandreducinggreenhouse gases(GHG): C.H.: "We are committed to the end of industrial wind factories in Ontario, and to exposing the experiment of climate fear-induced profiteering from so called, `renewables'andthe`green'agenda.Iamnotsurethatourobjectiveisinanyway meshingwithyouroverviewofengagingcommunities,consulting..."  Based on the interviews in totality, the cause of such a partisan position may be attributedtosomedevelopersundertakingapoorjobwithpublicconsultationandleaving the public with no choice but to find other ways to be heard (P.W.25 and S.E.5). The oppositionisgroundedinexperiencewiththeexistingprojects.Thedeveloperskeptwith the"decide-announce-defend"traditionandinformationprovisionwhichisthebottom-line engagement approach and the minimum level allowed by law.

I've been to a lot of angry meetings and I can'tseeanybodywhohasagenuineinteresteverwantingtocometoone."  While the reasons for protesting against wind energy are not straightforward, what motivates many of them is the lack of opportunities that concerned people have for meaningfulengagementinthedecision-makingprocess.Inresponsetothequestion:"What isthetriggerofpublicopposition?"oneparticipantstated: E.L.25. "I think it's because of, may be, feeling helpless like nothing they can do is goingtochangeanything..."  IfrenewableenergyingeneralandwindinparticularisamainstrategyfortacklingGHG emission and climate change, issues related to public support and opposition have to be addressed with the public being meaningfully engaged. Seeing the public as a barrier or ignorant about climate change is unlikely to be beneficial. Instead, a better approach to understandtheconcernsthatpeoplehaveandhowthesemightbemediatedisrequired.In theinterviewswithopponents,localcitizenscriticizedthedecision-makingprocess,feeling thatthedecisionshadalreadybeenmadeandtherewasalackofrealconsultation,which hardenedtheiroppositionagainstboththewindenergyandthedeveloper.Similartothe developers who should adapt more proactive approaches for meaningful engagement (early involvement, providing factual information, educating the public about both

Thegovernmentagenciescandoabetterjobofeducatingwhy orwhattheirlimitsareoratleastwhytheybelievethatthethresholdsorlimitsor setbacks everything are the way they are...I think that proper education would decreasethenotinmybackyardargument.Ireallydo."  Thechallengeisthatthebenefitsofeducationmaynotbemanifestedintheshort-term becausepeopleareusuallymoreconcernedaboutlocal,tangible,andimmediateproblems intheirdailylives(i.e.dealingwiththewindturbinesintheirbackyardsandbeingworried about the potential health effects) rather than a global issue. K.A.15 thinks it is better to start with children in school because they are more open to learning and being green. Education takes place only if the developers, the government, the Canadian Wind Energy

81 

Association, and the Ontario Sustainable Energy Association harmoniously work together (P.W.24andK.A.15). Typically, communities are inadequately informed about wind energy projects and are often excluded from decision-making and the planning process. Individuals most likely obtaininformationregardingwindenergyfromavarietyofsources(Internet,friendsand family,media),somesourcesaremorereliablethanothers: P.R.8,10:"Internetisaninterestingcomponentofthisthatreallynoonecancontrol andpeoplefindwhattheywanttofindonit...Theproblemwhenthesethingsstart upisifthedeveloperisn'tgoingoutprovidinginformation,thelocalneighbourhood fillsitinanditmaynotbethecorrectinformation,butthevacuumcreatedwillbe filledwithsomething.SotheygototheInternetandfindoutwhatcouldconceivably go wrong or have gone wrong elsewhere and go from there.

Similarly: C.O.2:"Ithinkthattherehasbeenalotofmisinformationinthepublic,Ithinkthere has not been an effort by the developers to get the right messages out into the public realm, so every time we go into one of these things there has been a lot of debateandalotofthesamemessages,forfouryearsthemessagehasnotchanged, thepeoplethatarecomingtotheopenhousesnowaresayingthesamethingsthey were four years ago, so there's been no real education or change in thinking and there'sstillalotoffear.SoIthinkthere'sbeenalotofmissedopportunitiesinthe consultation,particularinwind."  Independentresearchfromsourcespeopletrustmayfacilitatetheinformationexchange process. Most participants support the notion of a knowledge-broker who can help significantlyinthisregard(theroleoftheknowledge-brokerisdiscussedinsection4.2.1). Moreover,participantsmentionedthattheexistinginformationonthedeveloperwebsites and at the library or at local municipalities was not inclusive enough due to: (1) volume: hundreds(ifnotthousands)pagesofmaterialintechnicallanguage,whichrequirealotof timeandexpertisetoreview(D.S.10,B.O.7);(2)availability:noteveryonehashighspeed Internet,requiringpeopleinruralareastodrivelongdistancestoalibraryormunicipality
82 

to read a copy of the documents (G.V.6, Z.C.14, V.M.13). There are solutions that some developers have deployed to overcome the problem. For instance, they have made information and reports available on CDs for the local community and/or made the summaryreportsavailableinplainlanguage,withtechnicalappendices: C.O.12: "During that time people can provide comments, and I understand how difficult it is to get access to that stuff, so we quite often will say as well, it's availableatthelibrary,it'savailableatthemunicipaloffice,ifyoucan'tgettoitor ifit'sdifficulttoaccessitfromtheInternetbecauseIunderstandweareworkingin alotofsmallcommunitieswheremaybetheinternetisnotgreat,we'lltakeitand burnCDsforthem.I'llburnaCDandsendittoanybody,sothereisanopportunity foranyonetogettheinformationandaspartoftheprocessaswellwehavetoput togethersummaryreportsandthereportsundertheregulationoftheREAprocess, theyarecalledAboriginalsummariesbecausetheyaresupposedtobe2or3page summaries of all the reports that you provide to the Aboriginal communities, we makethosepublicaswell.Theyareinplainlanguagesotheyarewrittensopeople willunderstandwhat'sgoingon."  In summary, there are stakeholders who are undecided and do not know much about theproject,buttheyarewillingtolisten.Inotherwords,theywanttolearn.Early,honest, and transparent communication to them through providing meaningful information will affect whether they support the project or not. It is helpful to have a productive conversationwiththosewhoaresupportingthewindproject.Therearestakeholderswith their minds made up who are against wind energy. Long-term education can affect their perception. In the end they might not support wind energy, but at least they may not activelyopposethedevelopmentoftheseprojectsintheircommunities.  4.1.3:Involve ProvincialandMunicipalityInvolvement Aspreviouslydiscussed,oneofthecontroversialprovisionsofthe GreenEnergyandGreen Economy Act is the exemption of renewable energy projects from municipality zoning
83 

approval(underthe PlanningAct).Thesituationisperceivedbysomeoftheparticipants (G.V.13, P.R.4) as a circumvention of a democratic decision-making process in which decisions regarding a wind project are made exclusively between developers and the province (and to a minor extent the federal authorities) through a draconian and repressive process. The rationale behind the creation of the REA was to streamline the approval process with the aims of enhancing investor's confidence and speeding up the process. While this seems admirable, there are number of important issues to take into account. First, the responsibility of making efforts to engage the stakeholders very clearly rests withthedevelopers.Theyhaveadutytoconsultwiththelocalcommunity(sections16and a8 of the REA). The MOECC has the power to refuse an application if they deem that the developer has not complied with the requirements. But, how the developer identifies the stakeholders, how they choose to engage them, and whether they do so in ways that are meaningful is key. It is also not clear how public questions should be responded to and incorporatedintotheplan.Asaresult,somedevelopersdomakeeffortsinthisregardtobe goodcorporatecitizens(refertosection4.1.4)while,basedonthecommentsmadebythe interviewees, many others do not have a very good track record. Many respondents believed that the province should be more involved (and available) in the process to enforceitsownrulesandregulations,protecttheenvironment,andalleviatetheconcerns, specificallytheprocessofAboriginalconsultation: C.O.13: "I think they [provincial government] need to make themselves more available.Ithinkthatwealwaysinvitespecificministrypeopletocometoouropen housesbecausealotofthequestionsareforthem,theyarenotabouttheproject, they are about the process and I think that if the MOECC made themselves more available, put more information on the website about how these things are determined,IthinkthatwouldmakepeoplefeelliketheMOECCisactuallyapartof

theprocessandnotjustthiswhiteivorytowerdecisionmakerthatnobodycanget accessto."  And:  S.E.41: "I'll start with Aboriginal first. Problem we've had in Ontario is the duty consultissupposedtobewiththeCrown,withtheprovince,butthat'snotthewayit works. Developers have to go out and consult, the government doesn't do any consulting. So the issue with that has been you have companies that are literally takingonhistoricproblemsintheformoftreatyrightsandyouknowlanddisputes, and ... is out there discussing these things with Six Nations, well that really to be honest is the role of the Federal and Provincial governments but they've been no wheretobefoundinthis.So,IthinktheFederalandProvincialgovernmentsneed to really step up in an aggressive way when dealing with lands and treaties and needtoconsult.Becauseit'sreallybeenleftuptothedeveloper."  Second, when interviewing municipalities, a lot of resentment and frustration arose becausetheydonothaveanysayinthedecision-makingprocess.Whilethemunicipalities arethefirstpointofcontactwiththelocalcommunity,theyaresidesteppedintheprocess. Peoplecometothem,askquestions,orcomplainandthemunicipalities'exclusionactually putstheminadifficultposition.Peopleseethelocalgovernmentasbeingassociatedwith theproblemofalackofpublicconsultationwheninrealitytheydonotreallyhavemuch jurisdiction as a commenting agency (not an approving agency) in the decision-making process.Meanwhilesomeparticipantstalkedaboutlimitedresourcesavailableatboththe municipal and provincial level to inspect the documents generated for wind energy applicationsandtherebyaddresspeople'sconcernsandquestions: P.R.17: "The nature of green energy projects is that in rural areas its smaller municipalities so it's hard to have that expertise available even in large municipalitiesletaloneasmallonethatmayhaveonlytenorfifteenstaff.Soitwill always be a matter of bringing in outside people for expertise on how we should dealwithit."  Also:  V.M.12:"Soakeypieceofthewholeprocessisyouneedadetailedtechnicalreview and local input of the process and that's not happening at all [at municipal level]
85 

and it hasn't been replaced by the province because you would need a massive bureaucracytoreplaceallthebuildingdepartmentsacrosstheprovince."  Third, the new approval process was not 100% successful in reducing the impact of dissent.Therefore,itseemsthattheREA(andtheopportunitiesforinvolvementthatare allowed)willlikelydiscourageanddistancepeoplefromthedecision-makingprocess.The currentpublicparticipationmodelinOntarioforwindenergyprojectsmaybedesignedto satisfylegalrequirements,butitisnotabletoincorporateabroadspectrumofthepublic interest,norachievegenuineparticipation,anddoesnotgenerallysatisfythemembersof the public. Practice reveals (as shown in these five projects) quite a reactive and tardy publicconsultationperformance.Thereactivenatureofsuchpublicparticipationpractices simply increases the problem of participation fatigue, limits the process of learning, and reduces power-sharing opportunities (Partidario and Sheate, 2013). The current regulatory governance process strips Ontario's municipal governments of much of their powertodecidewhethertheywantsuchfacilitiestobeestablishedintheircommunities. As a result, they may show their dissatisfaction by passing a "not a willing host" motion (more than 80 Ontario municipalities have formally declared themselves "not a willing host" to wind power generation projects) and passing bylaws that increases barriers to development, i.e. bylaws related to noise and shadow flicker. Councils can also refuse to grantbusinesslicenses. V.M.6:"Thereisamovementacrossmunicipalitiestodealwiththis,becausealotof municipalities feel caught in the middle, they have less powers than...well normal powersthattheyusetomanagethelocationoftheTimHorton'sortheStarbucksor whatever you want to use as comparable, can't be applied to wind turbines. But their constituents are screaming at them to do something and there are actually lotsofthingsthatmunicipalitiescandoandaredoingtotryanddealwiththeissue. Wellthemostaggressiveisabylawthatenablesthemunicipalitytoenforcethe40 dBprovincialstandard."

One important point, which was highlighted by some participants, is that developing windenergycouldturnintoapoliticalissue.Ifthereareasignificantnumberofpeoplein the community who oppose wind energy, getting a municipal counselor to support it becomesproblematic: F.M.6: "Unfortunately municipalities are political things and mayors are up for election every four years as are councilors, and virtually every municipality in southwesternOntariohasdeclaredthemselvesanunwillinghostforwindturbines."  Fourth,unliketheGermansystem,whichhasestablishedastableregulatoryframework based on strong environmental awareness, comprehensive legislation, and political commitments to renewable energy targets, Ontario suffers from weak regulatory governance (Holburn et al., 2010). Renewable energy development is tied to the Liberal partyasoneoftheirpolicies.Inothercountries,energypolicyislargelyestablishedatthe nationallevel,butinCanadathereisnointegratedelectricitymarket.Therefore,thefuture ofthewindindustryseemstobeonashakyground,especiallyiftheOntariogovernment shiftsitsfocusfromrenewables.Mostoftherespondents(seestatement SinAppendix3) donotseeabrightfutureforwindprojectsinOntario.Thepredictionsrangefromshifting to other renewables like solar, biogas, or geothermal to enhancement of storage technologies, small-scale projects, or developing wind projects in the other provinces or morenortherncommunities,ifthetransmissionissuecanbesolved.

And:  V.F.38:"IthinkbecausethegovernmentdidapoorjobimplementingthemicroFIT program and the FIT program it didn't work like they thought it would from the Germanside.OursystemismodeledaftertheGermanincentivesystem,youknow."  Also: R.S.21:"WemodeleditonsomeGermanpolicybutweshouldn'trollitouttheway we roll out those German policies and the program stopped and started, so many changes..."  Finally, one fundamental misconception between what the government allowed to happen and what rural landowners and stakeholders thought that they were getting into wasthescaleandfinancialownershipoftheproject.Localcommunitiesdidnotexpectthat wind would develop to such a large industrial scale. They were expecting smaller, community-based renewable energy systems (W.B.13). In the interview with the former MinisterofEnergywhopresentedtheGEA,heacknowledgedthissituation: "When we were crafting the policy we did not properly anticipate the ease with which developers would attract capital. We rather expected the model, which we sawandlikedsomuchinDenmarkwherelocalprojectstypicallyhadhundredsof localinvestors,wasgoingtobethemodel.Weexpectedthatdevelopersweregoing tohavetobemorecommunityintegratedinordertoraiselocalfinancialcapital.I criticizemyowneffortsandlookattheGreenEnergyActandsay,ohthisworked andthisdidn't,that'soneofthethingsthatIthinkinourconstructdidn'temerge thewaywehadexpected."   EnvironmentalReviewTribunal The completion period (reaching commercial operation) of the projects usually exceeded the original planned start date. All five projects were appealed by opposition groups (or individuals) through Ontario's Environmental Review Tribunal. As mentioned in section

88 

2.5.2, the ERT holds public hearings on appeals arising from the issuance of Renewable EnergyApprovalsundertheEnvironmentalProtectionAct.Asthisproponentbelieves: A.J.21:"SoOntariohasoneofthemostrobustoversightsattheprovincialleveland they allow municipalities, citizens, individuals to appeal the permitting process, theyprovideaccesstoitanditsanoption,it'sanongoingprocess."  However, as described in section 3.4.2, all the appeals for the five projects were dismissed because the Tribunal found that the appellants and the presenters had not establishedthatengagingintheprojectsinaccordancewiththeREAwouldcauseserious andirreversibleharmtohumanhealth,plantlife,animallife,andthenaturalenvironment. Astheseparticipantsdescribe: V.M.6: "...we've exhausted the Environmental Review Tribunal process and every projectgetsendorsedexceptone2andwe'renowmovingintothecourts,andthat's reallyexpensive."

For this purpose, the appellant should have either extensive knowledgeandgothroughhundredsofpagesofdocumentsandstudiesorhireanexpert that will require a commitment of extensive time and financial resources. As one of the participantsexplained: Z.C.10:"It'sveryveryupsetting.Wehavenosay,itseemslikeourdemocraticrights have been taken away from us. We spend a lot of money trying to appeal these projects, we are wives, husbands, grandmas, grandpas, many of us work full time, wehaveyoungchildren.Thisisnotourfulltimejobtryingtoappealthis;wedothis after hours, on weekends. It's very stressful and time consuming so it's really importantthattheproperconsultationisdoneearlyonbeforethereisanysortof investigationonwhichlandownersmybeinterested."  Theterms"serious"and"irreversible"aresubjectiveandopentointerpretation.Further definition is required to clarify which damages could be categorized as serious vs. nonserious or reversible vs. irreversible. This raises the questions: (1) Will the case be dismissedbytheERTifareversibledamageoccurs?(2)Whatifthereispotentialharmto the environment or human health? Moreover, these terms would make the section thresholdsohighastorenderitmeaningless.BasedonthisconcernintheSummerhaven project (by NextEra), the appellant challenged the ERT.

In the Summerhaven project, the developer set up a teleconference and ran a virtual workshoptoanswerpublicquestionsandconcerns.InDecember2012,thepublicadvised the developer that a newly-built eagle's nest was in a tree that was scheduled to be removedduetothetree'slocationimmediatelyadjacenttoaproposedwindturbine.After consultation and approval from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, the tree and nestwereremovedinearlyJanuary2013andateamofexpertswereemployedtoinstall five eagle nesting platforms adjacent to the project along the Lake Erie shoreline.

AlthoughthepublicparticipationprocessinOntariowindprojectsistypicallylimitedto providingnotificationsandinformingandconsultingwiththepublicinordertomeetthe requirementsoftheREAprocess,itisfairtorecognizethatinsomecasesthedevelopers are proactive by going beyond the legal requirements and holding more than two public meetings. They also attended a number of community events to share information about the project, keep people informed of the progress, and answer community members' questions about the renewable energy approval process. For example, in the case of the Ernestown Wind Park, the proponents first developed a relationship with the local community then talked about the project. Ernestown Wind Park is widely known as "the right sized wind park, in the right place". As the president of the developing company stated,theytriedtoplantaseedbasedonthelessonslearnedfromtheirpreviousprojects: K.A.9:"InKingston[Ernestownproject],IhavetohandittomyVP,shewasthinking ahead,partofitwasluck,foundtherightpersonandpeoplewhowerelocalwho wantedtoworkwithusandshehadtosticktoitforafewyearsbecausenothing was happening but eventually slowly it was a garden that came back, so it's important.

It is a huge miscalculation to assume that they can walk into a process that they know is confrontational, do the bare minimum, and expect all will go well with the community.

where communication and the exchange of information takes place. In the current situation, the developers provide information about the project and the public reacts to such information, usually by expressing their concerns. Sometimes this opinion exchange can become confrontational. Examples of these interactions include developers' open houses, public notices, websites, protest activities, and petitions. There are also within groupinteractions,forinstancealocalcommunitycouldgetinformationfromtheInternet, family, friends, and media. Misinformation could occur in the absence of an efficient informationprovisionsystem.Therearetheotheropportunitiesforinteractionwithinthat nexus,ratherthaninstructured,traditional,andtosomedegree,throughfamiliarroutines usually traversed to fulfill the legal mandates.

Sometimes, a more engaging decision-making process shifts the public expectations of the project and/or process. This may lead to limiting engagement actions by the developers in their future projects. Sometimes, there are expectations, which are more or less developed a priori and connected to a specific developer within a local, regional,ornationalprofile,beitpositiveornegative.Asclarifiedbythisparticipant(the

Sometimeslocalcommunityexpectationsrevolvearoundhowtheyfeeltheyshouldbe communicated to and how the information should flow (i.e. providing meaningful informationthoughtwo-waytransparentcommunicationattheearlystagesoftheproject).

The interactions also impact developer strategies on how to operate within these emotionally-charged situations and best engage a public divided into factions. Again in a circular flow, the developers' decisions about future engagement strategies are, in part, shaped by "interactions". The other influencing factors on engagement strategies are drawn from experience across multiple projects and hearing from the other developers' experience in different locations. For example, in their Thunder Bay project, Horizon Legacy deployed the same approach as Ernestown Wind Park. However, being in a different community with different expectations, the project faced significant opposition and delays; therefore, Ontario Power Authority 4 terminated the contract with the developer. The Big Thunder Wind Park project was significantly delayed due to the legal challengelaunchedbytheFortWilliamFirstNation.ThereasonwasthattheFortWilliam FirstNationtribedeclaredthedeveloperhadfailedtomeetitsobligationstoconsultwith

It is important to highlight that Aboriginalconsultationtakesplaceinaseparateprocessthancommunityconsultationand that it has its own complexities. This is where most participants from the proponent category state that they expect more involvement of the provincial government in the decision-makingprocesstoresolvethesetypesofconflicts.TheAboriginalconsultationis beyondtheboundariesofthisresearch;therefore,thisresearchhasdeliberatelyleftoutan analysis on the similarities and differences of the Aboriginal consultation vs. the local communityconsultationprocess. Interactions not only affect the engagement strategies chosen by the developer, they alsoshapefuturemoves.Engagementactionsmaybelimitedastheresearcherfoundsome developers chose not to become actively engaged with the local community, while for others,engagementactionswereextensive.Insomecases,assessmentofpublicresistance wasalsofoundtoimpactthelocationalstrategiesandthedevelopers'decisionofwhereto situate their projects. Developers have been found to be considering moving into other renewablesand/ormovingtootherprovincesforwindenergydevelopment. Finally, the local and provincial policy contexts are also important in determining drivers of project development; providing funding support for project development; shaping engagement strategies; and shaping local community participatory strategies or reactions. The provincial government is the owner of the REA process and provides approval and funding, whereas there is a limited input from municipalities in the REA process.  However, the Climate Action Statement (signed in Ontario in July 2015) places emphasis on the leading role of both provincial and municipal governments in reducing greenhousegasemissions;itisstatedthattheprovincialandmunicipalgovernmentsneed

102 

to work together to combat climate change and create new economic opportunities in renewableenergyandcleantechnologies. The nature of communities can be significant in the local policy context, shaping expectations, and forming reactions when considering socio-demographics, level of prosperity,mixoflong-establishedandmorerecentincomingresidents,mixofpermanent residentsandthosewhoownacottage(therefore,donotliveintheareaallyeararound), andthelevelofsocialcapital.Forinstance,inthecaseoftheHaldimandRenewableEnergy Project,thelocalhistoricalcontextmanifesteditselfasakindofambivalence.Ontheone hand, the long association of the area with coal-fired power plants was linked to recognition of the reliance of the community on the jobs the wind project would provide and the extra income to land owners from leasing their property to developers. On the other hand, residents (those who opposed the project by taking their concerns to the Ontario ERT) showed little confidence that the developers would be willing or able to exercisetheirdutyofcareregardinghealthandecologicalconcerns.

Ontheotherhand,theabsenteelandownerorcottagermightbemoreopentohavingwind turbines on their land (B.O.5). Also, there are the groups who have been there longer, typically farmers with large tracts of agricultural land where wind turbines do not negatively impact growing crops or property value. They earn a living from the land and have grown crops on it; they see wind turbines as another option for producing income fromthelandtheyown(P.R.5). These case studies have shown significantly apparent degrees of local activity, anticipation of negative impacts, and multidimensional interactions. Figure 22 demonstrates the complexity of the decision-making process with regards to a wind project.Inthenextsection,themainthemesdirectlyrelatedtosub-researchquestionsand the updated conceptual framework are discussed. It is an attempt to show how the recommendedframeworkwouldprovideabetterwayofpublicengagement,fromNIMBY tocollaboration.


4.2.ThemesRelatedtotheSub-Questions Inordertoanswerthetworesearchsub-questions("Whatarethemajorsocialconflictsof windpowerdevelopment?"and"Whatistheroleofaknowledge-brokerinresolvingthese conflicts?"), the data was examined through the lens of the recommended conceptual framework. Before letting the data form the codes and suggest main themes, interview transcriptions were coded to organize data into targeted categories based on units of analysis and the main elements of the conceptual framework. This section presents the resultsofthisanalysis. 



105

4.2.1.Collaborate Knowledge-Broker:CollaborativeProblem-Solving In response to the question: "How important is public engagement and securing public support for wind project development?" all respondents placed emphasis on the importance of public support for the following reasons: first, pragmatically, they believe publicengagementandsupportcanbeusedtoincreasethelikelihoodofsuccessfulsiting. ThereisarequirementintheREAandLRPthatthelocalcommunityshouldbeinformed about the projects and that decisions should be discussed with local communities. As mentionedinsection4.1.2,inthenewLRPprocessthereisapointsystemforcommunity engagement that will facilitate securing the approval of the project for the developers. Moreover,developersdonotwanttogotoacommunitywhichisnotawillinghostoftheir project. As lack of support will make it difficult to work in that community and get the permissionsoragreementsonroaduse,entrypermits,buildingpermitsetc.,publicsupport is important when the developers get into details like construction logistics. When local community and the municipalities are consulted, they are less likely to oppose (and may even support) decisions and set up roadblocks to the implementation of the project (K.A.11,F.M.20,P.R.4). Second,thepublicmaybeengagedbecauseinademocraticsocietytheyaredeemedto havearighttoparticipateindecisionsthataffectthem.AccordingtotheInstituteofPublic Policy Research (IPPR, 2007), public engagement with energy issues is beneficial as it empowerspeopletohelpresolveproblems,improvegovernance,deependemocracy,and buildtrust.Theinterviewsrevealthattrustandbuildingarelationship(section4.2.2)in the decision-making process about wind energy is important for addressing health and

The Green Energy Act not onlylaidoutthisregulatoryregimethat'sveryfavourabletothewindindustry,it also superseded 21 pieces of legislation in Ontario, that's 21 pieces of democraticallydevelopedlegislationthatarenownotnullandvoid,butpowerless, the Green Energy Act supersedes them and that includes the Heritage Act of Ontario, the Clean Water Act, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, the NiagaraEscarpmentProtectionAct.TheGreenEnergyActsupersedesallofthose. Those were democratically passed pieces of legislation that now the people of Ontariocannotusetoprotecttheircommunities."  Third, public engagement may lead to better or more competent decisions by the developers through taking advantage of local knowledge. It is an opportunity to receive feedback,identifyissues,andtherebyattempttoaddressthoseasbestpossible. Theaforementionedreasonsresonatewiththebroadercultureofcollaborativeformsof decision-making. The more people provide input, the more ownership they take or the more involved they feel in the process and as a result become more accepting of wind projects.Sometimesdifficultchoiceshavetobemaderegardingwindprojectdevelopment, but it is better to have them made with an informed and accepting public rather than by politicians at Queens' Park on their behalf. When people are involved in the decisionmakingprocesstheylearnaboutwhatcanandcannotbeaddressedbydevelopersandthey maybemorewillingtoacknowledgeandagreeonsomethingthatisthebestcasescenario forthepublicinterest.Therefore,thereisaneedforanewwayofconceptualizingpublic

Themainconceptintheproposedconceptualframeworkisthepresenceofthetrusted third party, or knowledge-broker, in the decision-making process. Only one participant believed the knowledge-broker could not help improve the current decision-making process. This interviewee stated that there is a fundamental issue in wind project developmentwhichneedstobeaddressed: J.F.11:"It'snotaquestionofhowyougetpeopletobuyintoitoracceptit,orhow youmaketheprocessanymoreequitableorfair.Theproblemisacompletebreak downofthedemocraticprocessintheprovinceofOntario.That'swhattheproblem isandyoucan'tgettothatuntilyouhavesomehardfactualresearchbeingdone andonthetablehonestlyandtransparentlyandyouhavetounderstandit'snota questionhiringofsomebody[expert]inpublicrelationswhocanputagoodspinon somethingandwhocanmakethepublicthinkthatit'sgoodforthem."

Theproposalputforwardinthisresearchisthatparticipationinapprovingwindenergy projects in Ontario should be collaborative and in this framework, the inclusion of a knowledge-brokerassuresthatlearningtakesplace,thatradicaltensionsaredefused,and conflicts are resolved through effective communication and the provision of meaningful information. The adoption of the proposed framework and the presence of a knowledgebroker may help reduce the completion period by providing for a smooth flow of information, effective communication, and decreased public opposition. In turn, this minimizesthepossibilityofgoingthroughtheEnvironmentalReviewTribunalprocessthat may result in delays in implementing a project. Due to the importance of this topic, participants' responses and comments about the knowledge-broker are summarized in Table8. From the analysis of the interviews, it is evident that the advantages of the role of the knowledge-broker outweigh the challenges. There are always some people in the community who want to know more about the project. They want to have conversations withtheproponentabouttheconcerns;thisiswheretheknowledge-brokercanhelpthem tocometogetherandhaveanhonestdiscussionofwhatcanbedonetoclarifyexpectations and what the reasonable outcome could be.

Therefore, the knowledge-broker could and probably should be hired by a committee which has representatives from all of the aforementioned stakeholder categories. As a part of consultation process, the developer should fund the process to cover the associated expenses of hiring a knowledge-broker. It will not add anothersteptotheconsultationprocesssinceCLCmeetingsarealreadyinplaceandthey couldbeusedasthevenueforselectingandhiringtheknowledge-brokerforaproject.The regulations need to make it clear that in a CLC meeting there should be representatives from developers, the municipality, the local community, and the provincial government, namely MOECC, where assessing and selecting the knowledge-broker is a joint decision. Also, as suggested by some participants, the CLC meetings should be formed during the earlystagesofprojectdevelopmentinsteadofafterdevelopersreceiveREAapprovalafter decisionshavealreadybeenmade.Inthisway,theCLCmeetingswillreflectacontinuation of positive interaction with the community:  (1) by providing an ongoing opportunity for two-way communication and information sharing; (2) to assist in the identification and resolution of current and potential community issues related to the siting, construction, installation,use,operation,maintenance,andretirementofwindturbines.Afterwards,the

It would be beneficial if the knowledge-broker could be hired locally to provide the connection between locals and the project. In this way, they walk into that community with some credibility(R.N.8,R.S.14). As mentioned above, the credibility of knowledge-brokers regarding independence is largelyamatterofthestakeholders'perception.Toovercomethisconcern,ananonymous pooloffundscouldbecreatedandadministratedbytheIESOortheOntarioEnergyBoard (OEB).

third of the country's energy needs. Wind power is the main source of Denmark's renewable energy production. There are nine coal-fire power plants in Denmark.

1.EconomicConcerns Opponentsbelievedthatthesmallamountofenergygeneratedbywindcannotcompensate foritsnegativeimpacts.Inanotherwords,theydonotwantrenewablesintheirareaatany cost. The opponents call the Green Energy and Green Economy Act an oxymoron because they believe the government failed to conduct a proper cost and benefits analysis. This issueelicitedcriticismregardingtheneedforsubsidiesthroughtheFITprogramtomake wind power economically viable and produce large profits for the developers at the expenseofruiningruralareas.AsStatement Lshows(Appendix3),oneareaofconcernis the impact of wind projects on the local economy including the energy market (excess powerandhigherprices),propertyvalues,andtourism.

Some participants expressed concerns that Ontario taxpayers are stuck with 20 years worth of subsidies contracts because the government basically paid the wind companies regardlessofwhetherornottherewasaneedfortheirpower.Excesspowergetssoldata loss: V.M.11: "... I mean it's not cost effective. There's billions of dollars in subsidizing hydro that we're sending to Quebec and States where [it] is busy using the cheap electricity to take jobs from Ontario. The whole thing is absurd so there's no economic benefit to it, in fact there's economic cost, stray voltage and its causing peoplehealthproblems,anditkillsbirds,batsandallsortsofotherthings."  Also, some participants alluded to the term "energy poverty" which is caused by higher electricityrates: D.B.8:"Somepeopleontheperceivedside,theydon'tliketheFITprogramandthey see that those contracts are made for a higher per hour kilowatt charge on wind

energy which they see as coming back to higher hydro rates themselves, so they don't like the governments approach to it saying that they don't support wind becausetheydon'tneedhigherenergycosts."  And:  G.V.21: "...So you're seeing the cost, and this is another thing from Dr. Michael Trebelko of the University of Toronto when he talks about the economic effects of wind power, it has caused electricity rates to go up dramatically which in turn is having an effect on...consumers are seeing a term called energy poverty, we saw thatintheUnitedKingdomandwenowhavethatinOntario..."  Concernsaboutdecreasingpropertyvaluesandshrinkingtourismwerehighlightedby some participants during the interviews. CanWEA's fact sheet about property value (usuallydistributedinpublicopenhouseforallwindprojects)clearlydescribestheresult of studies showing no statistically relevant relationship between the presence of a wind projectandnegativeeffectsonpropertyvalues.Onestudyconductedin2010inChathamKent,OntariobyCanningConsultantsInc.Accordingtothepublishedreport,inthestudy area, where wind farms were clearly visible, there was no empirical evidence to indicate that rural residential properties realized lower sale prices than similar residential propertieswithinthesameareathatwereoutsideoftheview-shedofawindturbine.A similaranalysisbytheUSDepartmentofEnergy'sLawrenceBerkeleyNationalLaboratory showsthesameresults:researchersexamined7,500single-familypropertysalesbetween 1996and2007,coveringatimespanfrombeforethewindfarmswereannouncedtoafter construction and operation. They found that proximity to wind energy facilities does not haveapervasiveorwidespreadadverseeffectonthevalueofnearbyhomes.

Theaboveargumentsuggeststhatthenarrativearoundeconomicconcernspropagated by wind project opponents can be challenged. However, there is need for a deeper discussiontoaddressthislegitimateconcernbythepublic.Presentingfactualinformation alongwitheducationaboutthelong-termbenefitsofrenewablesandtheurgencyrelated to climate change may have a positive impact in shifting public attitudes toward renewables.  Besides, there are local economic benefits that stem from the development and operation of wind facilities in Ontario. The developer and municipality enter into a benefitsagreementthatsetsoutthefinancialbenefittobepaidtothemunicipalityandin turn,themunicipalitywillusethefinancialbenefitforcommunity-relatedprojects.Instead of saying "no" to renewable energy projects, some municipalities use their leverage inextraordinaryways to figure out opportunities that are to the benefit of the local community, e.g. a community vibrancy fund (CVF) and municipal property tax. For small communities with limited municipal resources, community vibrancy funds can have a significantimpactonlocalprojects.Thefundwillprovideastablesourceofsupportover the next 20 years (the life of the project), which will support local community, the environment,andhealthandwellnessinitiatives.BasedontheHaldimandCountyReport (#CAO-02-2013)oftheChiefAdministrativeOfficeronJuly22,2013,inHaldimandCounty,

 2.HealthConcerns Threattohumanhealthwasapredominantconcernraisedintheinterviews.Allopponents identifiedhumanhealthastheirforemostconcern.Eventhoughthehighestlevelofhealth assessmentinCanada-HealthCanada-hasnotdeclaredanyillhealtheffectsfromwind turbines,healthimpactsarestillthemainconcernofthepublic.InJuly2012,inresponseto publicconcernsaboutpossiblehealtheffectsfromwindturbines,HealthCanadadecidedto undertake a large-scale epidemiology study in collaboration with Statistics Canada. In October 2014, Health Canada announced the results of the study that found no link betweenwindturbinesandhealtheffects.Thefollowingissuewasfoundtobestatistically associated with increasing levels of wind turbine noise: annoyance towards several wind turbinefeatures(i.e.noise,shadowflicker,blinkinglights,vibrations,andvisualimpacts). The following issues were not found to be associated with wind turbine noise exposure: self-reported sleep issues (e.g. general disturbance, use of sleep medication, diagnosed



120

sleep disorders); self-reported illnesses (e.g. dizziness, tinnitus, prevalence of frequent migraines and headaches); chronic health conditions (e.g. heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes); and self-reported perceived stress and quality of life (Health Canada, 2014). By the time the report was published, the public perception about health impactshadbeenformedoverthefiveyearssincetheintroductionoftheGreenEnergyand Green Economy Act. People with negative perceptions had already been through the process, thereby tainting public perception of the decision-making process for wind projects. Accordingtomanyrespondents(opponents),concernedopinionsaroundhealthimpacts were acquired through research and interaction with the other members of community. Whenaskedwhatparticularresearchunderlaytheiropinions,participantsfrequentlycited theworkofStevenCooper(Australia)6andInternetsources.Thevalidityoftheresearchon wind turbines and human health emerged as an important topic in several interviews. Many opponents contested the integrity of studies conducted (or funded) by the wind industry.Someopponentscomparedwindenergywiththetobaccoindustry.Theybelieve, as occurred with cigarettes and the decades it took for governmental agencies and scientists to admit to the ill-effect of cigarettes on health, health issues related to wind turbinewillultimatelymanifestinthenearfuture(G.V.3,B.O.22,V.M.17): V.M.17:"Thisthingremindsmesomuchofthetobaccoindustryinthestateswhere there was a very powerful lobby called the tobacco institute who was funding researchthatprovedthattobaccowasabsolutelysafe."

This was not a peer-reviewed study and Cooper asserted that there is a need for further studies to examine if the noise has direct impact on human health. Nonetheless, Cooper's study is referred to as evidence of the health effects of wind turbines by opposition groups,eveninOntario(bothWCOandOntarioWindResistancepostedtheresultsontheirwebsites).

 However,thehistoryofwindturbinesintheUSdatesbackto1970s.Thefirstlarge(utilityscale) wind facilities were installed in 1981 (EERE, 2015).

turbineslikeanyotherman-madestructuresuchasmeteorologicaltowersorpowerlines, andalsothroughlossoftheirnestinghabitat.Theimpactofwindturbinesonwildlife,most notably mortality rate of birds and bats, has been widely studied.  The American Wind Wildlife Institute research found evidence of bird and bat deaths; however, the study concluded that these impacts are relatively low and do not pose a threat to species populations(AWWI,2015).AnotherstudyconductedinCanadashowsthatthecombined effectsofcollisions,nestmortality,andlosthabitatonbirdsassociatedwithCanadianwind facilities appear to be relatively small compared to other sources of mortality such as communicationtowers(Zimmerlingetal.,2013).Bothstudiesdiscussmitigationmeasures which can reduce mortality rates including: better siting of wind turbines; advances in windturbinetechnology;featheringofwindturbinebladesatnightduringpeakmigration; installation of modified marine radar to detect approaching bird activity and when necessary,automaticshutdowntheturbines;andkeepingwindturbinesmotionlessduring times of low wind speeds which could reduce bat deaths by more than half without significantly affecting power production because bats are most active when wind speeds arelow(AWWI,2015;Zimmerling etal.,2013).However,theoverallrelativelylowlevels of bird and bat mortality caused by wind turbines suggest the mitigation measures described above might not be necessary for all projects. Mitigation strategies could be adapteddependingoneachproject.Forinstance,thePDNWprojectwhereCapitalPower conductedstudiestomonitorpre-andpost-constructiontundraswansactivitiesbasedon therecommendationmadebytheEnvironmentalReviewTribunal. Inthebiggerpicture,themainissueisonceagaintheabsenceofmunicipalinvolvement indecision-making.Ifamunicipalityisthefirstpointofcontactwiththelocalcommunity

In this way both the municipality and the local community do not feel blind-sidedbecausetheyareinpossessionoffactualinformationinadvanceandquestions andconcernscanbeaddressedearlyonintheprocess: R.S.21:"...oneofthethingsthatwasverydifficultforthetownshipandcouncilwas that people were used to being able to go to their municipal government, it's the government closest to them that they feel they have the most impact on and they feel that level of government has their voice. But they didn't because the policy is writteninsuchawaythatthelocalmunicipalgovernmenthasalmostnovoice.It was very hard on them because people would come to them and complained and they didn't have any power. So the process, the normal democratic process was circumventedandthat'saseriousproblem."  ItseemsthatthefactsheetspreparedbyCanWEAanddistributedbythedevelopersat open houses about property values, health, and ecological concerns (Appendix 8) are not comprehensiveenoughtoanswerquestionsandalleviateconcerns.Theyaretoosimplistic to be able to trump existing misinformation. There is a need for a better approach for informationprovisiontoaddressquestionsinaconvincingway.Despitewindpowerbeing widely seen as a clean alternative to fossil fuel-based energy generation due to the perpetualabundanceofthewindresource,theadaptabilityofwindpowertoexistingland use, its non-polluting character, increasing cost effectiveness, and small footprint, the development of wind power has still proven to be an uphill challenge in Ontario. Increasingly, the environmental literacy of local communities will likely have a large influence on how communities shape attitudes towards a specific project. Educational programs should be established to not only educate the public concerning a specific
 125

planned or proposed project, but also to inform the public about all renewable technologies, climate change, and energy policy. Such an educational system should not only rely on the wind industry, but instead a larger scaled program utilizing the existing educationinfrastructurebyincorporatingtheaforementionedsubjectsintotheelementary andsecondaryschoolcurriculum.Windenergymustbeshowntobemorethanafinancial investment where local people feel that their community is being appropriated by "outsiders"andtheirprojects.Bynotcommunicatingthepositiveaspectsofwindenergyto thepublic,manyofthehiddenbenefitsofwindenergyareoftenleftunspoken.  4.3.LessonsLearned:ABetterFuture The conflict over developing wind facilities in Ontario is evidence of a new type of environmental controversy. One side of the argument is composed of wind proponents whoadvocatetheenvironmentalbenefitsofwindenergytotackleclimatechange,secure energy sources, and overcome the challenges of possible fluctuations in fossil fuel prices. Their argument is simply that the advantages of wind energy clearly outweigh its disadvantages. On the other side of the argument are the opponents who are concerned with potential health and ecological impacts. They find wind turbines too visible and disruptive. This two-sided argument is referred to as "green vs. green" debate in several studies(Groothuis etal.,2008;Kahn,2000;Warren etal.,2005).Interviewsshowthatthe proponent's tendency to highlight the global benefits of wind energy have little influence onlocalpublicattitudes,asresidentsareconcernedwithimmediateimpactsintheirarea. In addition, the interviews show that opponents believe wind energy would not be beneficialinanywayandwillposeserioushealthandenvironmentalrisks.Evidently,the



126

so-called public consultation process did not address these issues properly. Inadequate consultation results in failing to effectively answer questions and address concerns, neglectingtotakelocalinterestsintoaccount,andtriggeringintensefeelingsofresentment and frustration toward the developers and the consultation process. The developers' lawsuits7against opponents who were actively (sometimes aggressively) opposing wind energy development in Ontario did not help this situation and caused another backlash againstwindindustry.ThesetypesoflawsuitsarecalledStrategicLawsuitAgainstPublic Participation (SLAPP) and are an attempt to intimidate and silence critical voices by causingthemtoincurlegalcostsduringlawsuitsthatdragonformonthsoryears(Shapiro, 2010).ShapiroexplainsthattheresultsofastudydoneonSLAPPsshowsthattheSLAPP plaintiffshavefailedtowinover80%ofthecases.Therefore,theSLAPPplaintiffdoesnot normallyexpecttowinthelawsuit.Instead,thetacticoflaunchingalawsuitistocreatean intimidatingorchillingeffectonpublicparticipation.

In Ontario, some efforts have been made to improve public engagement in renewable energy development decision-making processes; however, practices still remain heterogeneousandlocalcontroversieshavenotbeensettled.Inotherwords,theoutcomes from wind energy decision-making processes remain, to some extent, difficult to predict andunderstand.Thisrelatesnotonlytorenewableenergy,butalsotofacilitysitingmuch morebroadly(i.e.alandfillorwastemanagementfacility).Localapprovalofawindproject is not only a key element to its success but also a driving factor for future wind developmentsingeneralsincepublicattitudetowardwindenergyisinfluencedbyseveral social factors and may be altered through a person's interaction with those who have experience with wind turbines. Because of this contingent nature of the participation processes, wind developers need to cope with local resources and singular stakes. From thisperspective,developersshouldhavedifferentrecipesforparticipationbecausegeneric recipes fail (i.e. open houses) to take into account the specificities of particular social factorsproducedbyeachuniqueproject. There is an urgent need for the provincial government and wind industry to better
 128

educate the public about wind energy and how it differs from conventional sources. The riskandcostassociatedwithwindenergyshouldbecontextualizedincomparisonwiththe risksposedbytheothersources(e.g.nuclearwaste)andtheirlife-cyclecosts.Thereisan immediateneedtochangethepublicconsultationprocessfromavenuefordebateabout wind energy based on a vicious cycle of "decide-announce-defend" to an opportunity for gathering local community opinions and answering their questions and concerns. This would mean acknowledging and valuing local expertise; recognizing the important contribution that different stakeholders can bring; and taking into account people's attachment to places and local surroundings. For the provincial government and the developers this means framing discussions in ways that are meaningful to local people; building up long-term relationship in communities; showing interest in involving them; being socially responsible and accountable for the decisions that affect the local community;finally,employingstrategiesthatarenotexclusive,butactivelyseektoengage differentstakeholders. This research was an effort to shed some light on the variety of practices of public participation in wind energy projects (Table 10 presents a summary of results). The suggestion is that collaborative decision-making and a knowledge-broker could help in achievingconsensusoverwindprojectsitingdecisions.Inresponsetothequestion"What are some strategies that could be adopted to increase the level of public participation in order to reach a consensus?" the respondents were unanimous that the current process doesnothaveefficiencyandneedstobeimproved.Theirsuggestionsinclude:availability ofthedevelopers;beingresponsive,proactive,andpresentwithinthecommunity;building relationshipsandtrust;financialownershipoftheprojectsbylocalcommunity(partial

Almost all of the participants agreed that the presence of a knowledge-broker could help the decisionmaking process and move the process from information provision to collaboration. In addition, a number of participants recommended some participatory techniques which theybelievedworthtrying,suchas:all-dayopenhouses;formingtheCLCduringtheearly stages of the process; online engagement and using the power of social media; small meetings in a more friendly setting; telephone town-halls; citizen's reference panels or a citizenadvisorypanel;andpublicreferendums. When asked about consensus, several participants pointed out that consensus sounds like a loaded word and in the real world appears unreachable. This resonates with the criticisms toward Healy's collaborative decision-making. O'Neill (2002) believes that the viabilityofconsensusbuildingishamperedasthoseinpowerhavethemeansandthewill



131

to sabotage such efforts while seeming to participate in the process. This situation is worsened when complex decisions are being made under tight deadlines where experts have an inbuilt position of power. This view ignores the fact that collaborative decisionmaking itself helps reduce the asymmetrical power distribution by inviting a variety of people to have input into the decision-making process instead of leaving controversial decisionsuptotheprovincialgovernmentandtheERTprocesses,whichslowsdownthe implementation of projects. Besides, by definition consensus building is a conflictresolutionprocessusedmainlytosettlecomplex,multipartydisputesthataffectdifferent groups of people with different interests (Burgess and Spangler, 2003). Inevitably, consensus building or collaborative decision-making takes time, but the involved stakeholders can establish a common understanding on how to find the best possible solutionwhichislesslikelytofaceproblemsintheimplementationphase.SagerandGastil (2006) place emphasis on the fact that consensus building differs from majority rule decision-makinginthateveryoneinvolvedmustagreewiththefinaldecision.Sometimes peoplemustmakedifficultdecisionswhichwillnotmakeeveryonehappy,butmuchofthe opposition is nullified because an agreement is reached after all interests are taken into account, all alternatives are discussed, the cost and benefits of the alternatives are analyzed,andthebarrierstoimplementationareevaluated.Theimplementationmayhave its own difficulties as unforeseen problems may transpire, but a good collaborative decision-makingprocess builds relationshipsamongstakeholders,allowingthepartiesto worktogethertoresolvethoseissues. In order to involve all the stakeholders and define their relations, there is a need to conductastakeholderanalysisandsocialnetworkanalysis.Ifsomepartiesareleftoutor

A social network analysis is then carried out to explore the relationship among, and between, various actors and the wind energy technology itself. Social network analysis helpswithunderstandingtheformationandboundariesofnetworks,therelationshipsand interactionsbetweenactorswithinanetwork,andvariouselements(i.e.social,economic, political,andculturalfactors)ofanetworkthatcreatestability.AsMcLarenLoring(2007) describes, the level of network stability is determined by four indicators: a strong relationship among actors within the network; immutable mobiles or the presence of documents within a network which shows the degree of organization; multiplicity or different actors with a range of identities; and critical actors who usually dedicate substantialamountsoftimeandefforttotheprocessandwithoutwhomanetworkcould notformorsurvive.Criticalactorstypicallybringspecialskills,knowledge,oraparticular convictionabouttheprojectthatmotivatesothers.Recentstudiessuggestthatthepublic's concern regarding the environmental impacts of wind farms can be subjective and the sociologicalfactors,suchasaperson'sknowledgeofthetechnology,exposuretoparticular mediareports,socialinfluencesandnetworks(i.e.theopinionoffriendsandfamilyliving in the local area) are important in determining public perception of wind farms (DevineWright,2005;Elthametal.,2008). These two initial steps allow for the creation of a package of assessment data, expert reports,andotherresearchmaterialthatwouldbeuser-friendlyforallstakeholders.This packagewouldclearlyarticulatetherelevanceoftheoppositionnetwork'sconcernsabout the decision-making process and outcomes. As Bijlsma etal. (1988) explain, many social groupsfeelthatthelackofinformationandthelackofopportunitiestoacquireknowledge are considerable barriers to public participation. Therefore, at this stage the knowledge-



136

brokercanplayanimportantroleintacklingthisobstaclebyfamiliarizinglaypersonswith certain information regarding a technical issue such as wind energy and communicating the package in a way that it is meaningful to all stakeholders. Moreover, the knowledgebrokerdirectlyworkswiththepublicthroughouttheinvolvementprocesstoensurepublic concerns and aspirations are consistently understood and considered. This allows the decision maker to structure the problem in collaboration with all interested parties and thereby establish an information exchange relationship. To establish an information exchange relationship, the following items should be determined at this stage: rules of procedure,rolesandresponsibilities,timelines,andlogistics. After completing a conflict assessment that evaluates the nature of the conflict and options for resolution, the interests of stakeholders can be identified by the knowledgebroker through brainstorming and idea mapping to define alternatives and encourage principled negotiation. Fisher and Ury (2011) defined four elements of principled negotiation:separatingthepeoplefromtheproblem;focusingoninterests,notpositions; inventingoptionsformutualgain;andinsistingonusingobjectivecriteria.Thenextstepis to bind the stakeholders to an agreement, followed by implementation, and creating a monitoring process to evaluate implementation. A neutral third party (or knowledgebrokerinthiscontext)canhelptestassumptionsandeducatewhereperceptionsdiffer.If emotions run high, a knowledge-broker can encourage involved stakeholders to let off steam and feel heard. As previously mentioned, where misunderstanding exists, a knowledge-brokercanworktoimprovecommunicationbysupplying(orcommunicating) fact-basedinformationandconveyingfeedbackbetweenandamongstakeholders(Figure 6). Applying the proposed framework may result in reaching a wise agreement which, as



137

defined by Fisher and Ury (2011), is a durable agreement that meets the legitimate interestsofallstakeholderstotheextentpossible,resolvesconflictinginterestsfairly,and takescommunityinterestsintoaccount.Ultimately,ifanREAdecisionistakentotheERT,a knowledge-brokercouldactasthemediator. Inconclusion,intheproposedcollaborativeframework,localcommunitiesneedtodraw upon their sense of public interest rather than self-interest and should partake in a meaningful participation in order to have substantive input into the decision-making process, solve problems, and reach an agreement, which they find acceptable. The collaborativeprocesscouldbecarriedoutbyaknowledge-brokerwhowill:identifyallof the stakeholders who should be involved; reframe the issues in terms of interests, which areusuallynegotiable,ratherthanpositions,orvalueswhicharedifficulttoimpossibleto negotiate; and encourage the stakeholders to brainstorm alternative approaches to problems.Ifthiscollaborationhappensthroughtheearly-establishedCLCs,theknowledgebrokercanproposethemechanismofcollaborationandagenda,thenprovidethedetailsin cooperation with the participants. This gives the participants a sense of control of the processwhichisastartingpointforbuildingtrust.Iftheparticipantsfeeltheyarenotpart ofthedecisionsbeingmade,consequently,itdiminishesthemainpurposeofthemeeting. Finally, both provincial and municipal governments should play a more active role to balancelocalpoliciesandgoalswithprovincialpolicies. Inordertoevolvetothenextlevel of the participation spectrum there is a need for revision to REA legislation regarding participation and more diligent enforcement of the current REA participation requirements.

6.Limitations
Similartotheotherresearchmethods,therearestrengthsandweaknessesassociatedwith usingacasestudy.Themostfrequentlycitedobjectiontotheuseofcasestudiesinsocial science research is the issue of representativeness. In other words, the research findings maynotbegeneralizedtothewiderpopulationbeyondthecasestudy(Burton,2000;Yin, 2009).Meanwhile,Yin(2009)putsforwardadifferencebetweenstatisticalgeneralization and analytical generalization. He explains that while survey research tries to generalize findingsbasedonasamplethatgeneralizestoalargerpopulation,casestudyfindingscan be generalized to some broader theory through analytic generalization. Flyvbjerg (2006) goesbeyondYin'sclarification.Flyvbjergexplainsthatoneoffivemisunderstandingsabout casestudyresearchisthegeneralizabilityissue.Itisincorrecttoconcludethatonecannot generalize from a single case. Flyvbjerg believes it depends on the case and how it is chosen. Moreover, formal generalization is only one of many ways that people gain knowledge. However, it is overvalued as a source of scientific development (Flyvbjerg, 2006). In order to overcome this shortcoming, comparative multiple case analysis on current windprojectswasconductedtohelpwiththeissueofgeneralizability.Theresultsarenot onlybeingusedaspartofacross-caseanalysis,butalsotheknowledgethattheresearcher gainedfromthisexperiencewasusedtodeveloptheconceptualframeworkandupdateit while progressing with the research. Care was given to carefully choose cases that were informativeandrepresentativeofothercasesinOntario(Burton,2000).Besides,casesare not restricted to one data source and one can utilize multiple evidentiary artifacts from different sources (e.g. interviews, observation, documents). However, the findings of this



140

researchmaynotbegeneralizablebeyondthecaseofwindenergydevelopmentinOntario. Ideallythefindingswillbecomparedtocaseexplorationsofwindprojectdevelopmentin other jurisdictions or compared to other possible complementary innovations or facility sitingsinOntario. Finally,inthecasestudyresearchmethod,datacollectionproceduresarenotroutinized. Thisdrawbackwasaddressedinthisstudybychoosingthequalitativeinterviewasadata collectionapproach(Burton,2000).Despiteitslimitations,interviewingprovidesrichand worthwhiledata.Itofferstheopportunitytolistentopeople'sconcernsandopinionsabout wind energy development at a level that is not accessible with a questionnaire (Stroh, 2000). A criticism towards the interview approach, as cited in the literature, relates to the effective wording of questions; i.e. neutralizing the sense of the questions, how the improper arrangement of questions may significantly affect the results, how some topics maybedifficult,controversial,orinappropriatetodiscuss,issueswithobjectivity,andhow the interviewer may affect the interview process and interviewee responses (Berg, 1998; Stroh,2000).Toovercomethisissueinthisresearch,aninitialinterviewguidewassetand adoptedaccordinglyduringthecourseoftheinterview.Interviewtopicswereplannedand pilotinterviewsweretested,bothtocheckthetopicsintheinterviewschedule,andalsoto allowforrefinementoftheinterviewingstyle. Itisalsoimportanttohighlightthedifficultyofgettingdeveloperstoparticipateinthis research, which further supports the lack of communication from developers as a significantbarriertoeffectivepublicparticipation.Mostofthedevelopersdeclinedtohave aninterviewordidnotrespondtotheinterviewrequests.Whenaskedaboutthereason,

7.Conclusion
7.1.Discussion With increasing concern amongst scientists and policy makers about the potential consequences of greenhouse gas emissions, there has been a growing interest in many countriestoincreasetheamountofenergygeneratedfromrenewableresources.According to many scholars, wind energy technology is the most economically profitable in comparison with many other renewable energy technologies and therefore has seen the mostdevelopment. InCanada,thefederalgovernmenthaslongresistedambitiousactiononclimatechange. However,inJune2015,thePrimeMinistersignedontoaG7commitmenttodeepcutsin greenhousegasemissionsby2050thatwilllowerthemasmuchas70%from2010levels withaneventualstopintheuseoffossilfuelsby2100.Meanwhile,inJuly2015,alandmark climatestatementwassignedinOntario.Untilrecently,theOntariogovernment'sdecision toshutdownthecoal-firedpowerplantsandinvestinginrenewableswereOntario'smain contribution to reducing GHG emissions. Encouragingly, the Ontario government is preparing to take more necessary steps such as theannouncement of a cap and trade programtolimitthemainsourcesofGHGemission,theestablishmentofa2030mid-term target for GHG reduction, the closure of all coal-fired power plants, and the large infrastructure investment in Ontario, which includes the electrification of the province's commuterrailnetwork.AccordingtotheGovernmentofOntario'sNewsroom2015,these initiativesworktowardsmeetingits2050GHGreductiontargetwhichistoachieveatarget 80%below1990emissionslevels.Finally,asNationalObserverreportedonDecember6, 2015, Canada surprised the COP21 (Paris climate change conference) by suggesting a



143

bolder, more ambitious target for cutting greenhouse gases. Canada's Environment and ClimateChangeMinisterwantedtheParisagreementtorestrictplanetarywarmingtojust 1.5 Celsius. Eventually, on December 12, 2015, the signatories to the Paris agreement agreedtolimitatemperatureincreaseto2degreesCelsius.PrimeMinisterJustinTrudeau promised that Canada would spend $300 million a year on clean technology innovation. However,thefederalgovernment'splanhasyettobecodified.AsannouncedbythePrime Minister, the federal government will meet with the provinces and territories to develop emissionplans. As described above, both federal and provincial governments have acknowledged that climate change is a serious issue. Consequentially, there should be a concerted effort to reduce GHG emission. Local communities need to consider "public interest" by either choosing to host a local wind facility (or the other forms of renewables) or alternatively, commit to energy conservation by reducing car dependency, source more food locally, increase recycling, etc.  However, it seems that the urgency to address climate change requiresbothactionsbedonesimultaneously.Astheworldbeginstoequipitselftoentera new era and end the use fossil fuels, inevitably, there will be major changes in the ways energyisproducedandconsumed.Consequently,thiswillbringnewformsoftechnology tothelandscape.Windturbinescanbeseenasbeautifulsymbolsofmoderndynamismor asuglymonsters,whicharetoovisible,disruptive,anddespoilersofbeautifulnature.How people perceive (local attitudes) wind energy technology will influence the future development,success,andacceptanceofit,whichwillthendeterminethelevelofmarket penetration. Possible ways - through deploying renewable energy - to reach ambitious targets of a low carbon economy could be: (1) adapting new technologies to make the



144

physical appearance of wind turbines less intrusive; (2) educating people that climate changeisamorecriticalenvironmentalconcernthanthelocalizedimpactofawindenergy development; (3) investing in alternative renewable energy technologies; and (4) advancementsinenergystorage. Environmental attitudes and the level of public support have heavily influenced the successorfailureofwindpowerprojects.Theinvolvementofthecommunityintheearly stages of developing a wind project should be considered in order to gain the mutual support of stakeholders, raise public awareness about the issues and complexity of balancing the various stakeholders' requirements/needs/interests, and provide informationtodevelopabetterunderstandingoftheissueonhandandidentifykeylocal environmentalknowledge.Subsequently,thismutualcollaborationmayleadtoincreased capacityofpublicengagementonissuesoflocalconcern(asalongtermachievement)and tothereachingofdecisionsthatarestronger,applicable,andmoreacceptable(shortterm achievement). Therecommendedframeworkinthisresearch(Figure23)requiresallstakeholdersto reconsidertheircurrentrolesinthedecision-makingprocess.Thepublicshouldengagein projectplanningandmonitorthedecision-makingprocessestoensurethattheirconcerns have been addressed. Developers should address public concerns through a consensus building process initiated early in their planning process. Federal and provincial governments have to reclaim their role of ongoing leadership and provide better criteria forimplementationandevaluationofthepublicparticipationprocesses.Anidealsituation wouldhavetheprovinceestablishanoverallpolicyframeworkastheydoformanyother typesofplanningandwithinthatframeworkthemunicipalitiescouldhavemoreinputand

properconsultation.Itseemsimperativethatfurthermodificationsneedtobemadetothe regulation in order to change the current course of action and thereby provide the provincial government with a framework where it can begin to work with local municipalitiesmoredirectlyandattempttobalancelocalandprovincialneedsandpolicies. Like the provincial government, local governments are elected to office to set policy and support the people who put them in these positions. If the policy is flawed, they need to worktogethertofixitonbehalfoftheirconstituents.Finally,theprocessrequiresathird party who is not only an intermediary, but also plays the role of a knowledge-broker to connect with stakeholders, share and exchange knowledge, and work on overcoming barriers. The knowledge-broker helps to fulfill the main requirement of the collaborative decision-making,whichiseffectivecommunication. The proposed framework challenges the assumption of some proponents towards the public including: people are polarized, volatile, emotional, and uninformed who argue basedontheirperceptionswhichmaynotcorrespondwithreality.Thenaturalresponseis toseethesituationasariskthatneedstobemanaged.Hence,thedevelopersputgreater bumpers and guardrails around that interaction and constrain the kind of questions that canbeaskedortheamountoftimeforthatdialogue.Therefore,allofthegoodintentions abouttransparencyandgenuineengagementfallbythewaysidebecausedevelopersare afraidsomeonewillattacktheirpositionsanddestroytheviabilityoftheprojectplan. Based on the recommended collaborative framework, there is a need to look at the decision-makingprocesswithfresheyes.Assumptionsshouldbemodifiedaboutthepublic to ones where they are perceived as caring, reasonable, purposeful, and curious. In this way,thepublicwillbeconsideredasresourcesratherthanrisksthatneedtobemanaged.



146

The developers need to be better at sharing what they know and to foster co-learning around questions and concerns. Moving the dominant view of the public as "a risk to be managed"towards"aresourcethatcanbetapped"isimportantforthreesimplereasons(if done well): increasing the legitimacy of the decision; enhancing the trust; and ideally creatinganenvironmentforthemakingofbetterdecisions.Todosorequiresarebalancing oftheconversation.Theevidencewouldsuggestthatwhenpeoplearenotheardthrougha collaborativeprocessthenitismorelikelythatadeterminedindividualorgroupwillfind waystomakehimself/herself/themselvesheardinwaysthatarenotonlyunappealingto theproponents,butcanbecauseforsignificantdelaysandaddedcosts.  7.2.ConcludingRemarks Iattemptedtomaintainobjectivityinthisresearchandpresentbothsidesoftheargument totheextentpossible.However,Iwouldliketoconcludewithapersonalobservationabout wind energy development in Ontario. As a supporter of renewable energy and public engagement in decision-making which affects people's welfare, I believe - and I stress emphaticallythatthisisapersonalview-majorenvironmentalissuescouldbecomemore contentious at the public policy level. My observations suggest that both wind energy developmentandthedecision-makingprocesshavebecomeemotionalissuesonthepartof general public. It is important to recognize how scientific studies can be a salient and objectiveinputinthedecision-makingprocess.Moderntechnologieshaveahighdegreeof technical complexity and correspondingly have a complex set of potential impacts on human health and the natural environment. Therefore, scientific analysis is required in ordertodiscoverwhichtypeofimpactmaybepresent.Asdiscussedabove,thescientific



147

studiesthemselvescouldbecomethesubjectofpubliccontroversiesandbitterstakeholder conflicts as there are references to other scientific studies which appear to point to different kinds of conclusions and, sometimes, these claims advance in the ERT or a courtroom setting. Claims about "phony science", "flawed study designs" and "bias" are repeatedly brought up during the interviews. One strategy to heighten the credibility of scientific assessments (especially where significant perceived risk and benefits are involved) is to communicate the results of such assessments effectively. Moreover, there arevalideconomicconcernswhichalsoneedtobeaddressed.  7.3.ContributionandFutureResearch Most of the available literature on wind energy development discusses the economic and political barriers, while relatively little research has focused specifically on effective communication.Therefore,thereisroomforfurtherresearchonresolvingsocialconflicts related to wind project development.

No obvious code could be found under "empower". It seems that the current decisionmaking process of wind energy development in Ontario is far from this level of public participation spectrum. However, there are some factors that impact the ability to empowerstakeholdersthroughtheimplementationofconsensus-baseddecision-makingin a negative way. Therefore, these factors are classified under "empower" in the following table.  Theinitialcodingschemeprovedtobecrudewhenitcametotheanalysisoftheroleofthe knowledge-broker in a collaborative decision-making process. There needed to be a significant refining of the coding scheme.

WIND FACTS

PROPERTY VALUES
Wind energy is generating clean electricity, new jobs and economic development opportunities in communities across the country. While wind energy has enjoyed growing success in many countries for several decades, it is a relatively new contributor to the power system here in Canada. As such, it is natural for people to ask questions. As a responsible industry, we are committed to ensuring Canadians have the most up-to-date factual information on wind energy.
Wind Energy: Providing Significant Local Economic Benefits
There are a number of factors that impact property values and it is difficult to isolate the potential impact of any single variable. What we do know is that multiple studies have consistently found no evidence that wind energy projects around the world are negatively impacting property values. In fact, wind energy projects provide new sources of stable revenue for municipalities and landowners in the form of taxes and lease payments. A 2010 study conducted in Chatham-Kent, Ontario, found there was no statistically relevant relationship between the presence of a wind project and negative effects on property values.1

A similar analysis by the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that proximity to wind energy facilities does not have a pervasive or widespread adverse effect on the value of nearby homes. Researchers examined 7,500 single-family property sales between 1996 and 2007, covering a time span from before the wind farms were announced to well after construction and operation. 2

A 2010 study looking at property values near the 396 MW Twin Groves Wind Farm in Illinois found prices were negatively affected before the wind farm was built, but rebounded after it was in place.3

WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY?
"The Board finds there is no evidence to allow the Board to conclude that since the construction of the wind farm properties on what [the landowner] defines as the west side of the Island have sold for less than properties on the east side."
Assessment Review Board. Commission de rÃ©vision de l'Ã©valuation fonciÃ¨re. File No: WR 113994. Municipality: Township of Frontenac Islands

"Based on the data sample and analysis presented here, no evidence is found that home prices surrounding wind facilities are consistently, measurably, and significantly affected by either the view of wind facilities or the distance of the home to those facilities."
The Impact of Wind Power Projects on Residential Property Values in the United States: A Multi-Site Hedonistic Analysis

"In the study area, where wind farms were clearly visible, there was no empirical evidence to indicate that rural residential properties realized lower sales prices than similar residential properties within the same area that were outside the viewshed of a wind turbine."
Wind Energy Study Â­ Effect on Real Estate Values in the Municipality of Chatham-Kent

"During the operational stage of the wind farm project, when property owners living close to the wind turbines actually had a chance to see if any of their concerns materialized, property values rebounded."

provides important protection for consumers. It is unlikely, for example, that natural gas will remain at today's low prices over the long term. Natural gas prices vary over time with changes in supply and demand Â­ just a few years ago electricity from natural gas-fired projects was more expensive than electricity from wind. Because wind requires no fuel, produces very little waste and consumes barely any water during operation, it also provides a hedge against the risk and uncertain costs of complying with future greenhouse gas emission restrictions and other environmental regulations. The cost to build wind energy continues to decline while significant efficiency gains are being achieved in modern

technology and siting. Wind projects also have very short construction periods and can be deployed quickly with significant positive impacts delivered to local communities. Wind energy developers absorb almost all of the upfront costs in developing their projects, which means no front-end or long-term risks to taxpayers and ratepayers. Unlike large nuclear or natural gas plants, wind energy projects can be scaled to meet changing economic and environmental circumstances. Modern electricity systems around the world include more wind energy to reduce carbon emissions, improve grid reliability, and sustain predictable and stable electricity prices.

WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY?
There is an urgent need to invest in new electricity generation and infrastructure after decades of underinvestment. According to the Conference Board of Canada, $347 billion in investment in Canada's electricity system is required between now and 2030 Â­ and all of these costs will be passed on to consumers.

According to Power Advisory LLC, wind energy generation accounted for only 5 per cent of the total increase in the electricity bill of Ontario consumers between 2009 and 2012.4 A recent analysis by GL Garrad-Hassan of wind sites in British Columbia also found that turbine costs are down roughly 20 per cent over the past few years while productivity has increased almost 30 per cent thanks to technological advances.5

HEALTH
Wind energy is generating clean electricity, new jobs and economic development opportunities in communities across the country. While wind energy has enjoyed growing success in many countries for several decades, it is a relatively new contributor to the power system here in Canada. As such, it is natural for people to ask questions. As a responsible industry, we are committed to ensuring Canadians have the most up-to-date factual information on wind energy. Wind Energy: Providing Clean and Safe Power
A growing body of peer-reviewed scientific evidence clearly indicates there is no direct link between wind turbines and health effects in humans. One of the most thorough examinations of the issue to date is a report released in December 2009 by an expert panel of medical doctors, audiologists, and acoustical professionals. The panel, established by CanWEA and the American Wind Energy Association, reviewed existing scientific literature on the perceived health effects of wind turbines and concluded there is "nothing unique" about the sounds they emit and no evidence they could plausibly have direct adverse physiological effects.
(continued on next page)

"According to the scientific evidence, there isn't any direct causal link between wind turbine noise and adverse health effects."1

Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and the National Public Health Institute in Quebec reached the same conclusion in their own independent reviews of available evidence. Responsible siting of projects and meaningful community engagement will address any sound impacts for neighbouring homes and communities. Ontario, for example, has the most stringent regulations in Canada with its requirement that turbines be at least 550 metres from dwellings.

Wind power for clean air.

While operating, wind turbines are powered by wind, producing no greenhouse gasses or pollution.

WHAT DO THE EXPERTS SAY?
"The body of accumulated knowledge provides no evidence that the audible or sub audible sounds emitted by wind turbines have any direct adverse physiological or health effects."
Dr. Robert McCunney, Pulmonary Division Specialist in Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Wind Turbine Sound and Health Effects: An Expert Panel Review

"The infrasound generated by wind turbines is not of sufficient intensity to cause health problems, or even a nuisance."
National Public Health Institute of QuÃ©bec study, 2009

"Ontario doctors, nurses and other health professionals support energy conservation combined with wind and solar power, to help us move away from coal."
