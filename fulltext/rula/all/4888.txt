Air  Rights  Development  and  Public  Assets:  An  Implementation  Handbook  for  Public  Entities   Master  of  Planning  in  Urban  Development,  2016   Nathan  Bunio   School  of  Urban  and  Regional  Planning,  Ryerson  University  

   Abstract  
Air  rights  development  (ARD)  above/below  public  assets  can  achieve  a  number  of  smart  growth   principles  while  also  being  a  land  value  capture  tool.  However,  there  are  several  complexities   associated  with  ARD,  along  with  bureaucratic  resistance  to  an  unfamiliar  form  of  development.   This  report  will  explore  the  different  ways  a  public  entity  can  address  these  challenges  and   build  an  effective  implementation  structure  for  ARD.   The  research  questions  will  explore  the  role  of  the  public  entity  in  ARD  and  the  options   available  to  address  the  associated  challenges.  For  this  exploratory  research,  the  methodology   will  involve  an  academic  literature  scan,  along  with  a  jurisdictional  scan  of  institutional   literature  with  Boston,  New  York,  Vancouver,  and  Washington  D.C.  as  primary  case  studies.  The   report  will  be  structured  around  the  challenges  of  ARD,  including  political,  regulatory,   facilitation,  and  economic  valuation  issues.  The  report  concludes  with  recommended  steps  in   creating  an  implementation  structure  for  ARD.   Key  words:  air  rights  development,  air  space,  land  value  capture,  implementation  policy

1.0  Introduction  
  

1.1  Urban  Context  
The  past  century  has  been  a  tumultuous  time  for  cities.  During  the  post-WWII  era,  North   American  cities  experienced  the  proliferation  of  low-density,  suburban  development,   supported  by  modern  planning  ideology.  However,  modern  planning  initiatives  experienced   backlash  in  the  late  20th  century,  led  by  Jane  Jacobs'  scathing  critique  in  The  Death  and  Life  of   Great  American  Cities  (Jacobs,  1961).  These  modern  planning  initiatives  created  divisive   expressways  in  inner-city  areas  (particularly  in  the  United  States),  segregated  uses  resulting  in   lifeless,  underutilized,  and  unsafe  environments,  solely  relied  on  the  automobile  for   transportation  thus  causing  congestion,  and  was  increasingly  costly  to  service  for  municipalities.   Today,  cities  are  continuing  to  confront  the  challenges  resulting  from  modern  planning   initiatives.  Additionally,  federal  and  provincial/state  governments  have  downloaded  the   responsibility  of  services  onto  municipalities  without  the  appropriate  revenue  sources,  resulting   in  fiscally  constrained  municipal  budgets  (Slack,  2009).  To  address  these  challenges,  there  is  a   new  age  of  city  building  that  adopts  an  alternative  form  of  planning,  often  called  the  New   Urbanist  or  Smart  Growth  movement.  Cities  are  beginning  to  adopt  Smart  Growth  principles   (Pim  &  Ornoy,  2003),  which  include:   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   preserving  greenspace;     integrating  land  use  and  transportation;     mixing  land  uses;   fully  utilizing  existing  urban  land  and  infrastructure;     ensuring  compact  building  design;     providing  transportation  options;  and     directing  development  within  existing  areas.  

The  type  of  urban  development  that  Smart  Growth  proponents  advocate  for  is  more   sustainable  for  cities:  servicing  costs  decrease  while  tax  revenues  increase,  farmland  and   natural  areas  are  preserved,  and  access  to  amenities  is  increased  to  build  healthy  communities.   This  policy  direction  coincides  with  recent  development  trends.  There  are  strong  urbanization

trends  in  Canada  and  the  United  States  as  cities  continue  to  grow  (Warren  et  al.,  2013).  In   particular,  downtowns  are  beginning  to  see  a  resurgence  in  growth  (Berg,  2012),  and  suburban   locations  are  transforming  into  mixed-use,  transit-oriented  areas  (Kelly,  2015).  Additionally,   empty-nesters  and  seniors  are  downsizing  to  condominiums  in  central  areas  (Lorinc,  2006),   while  the  next  generation  of  homebuyers,  the  Millenials,  prefer  mixed-use  and  higher  density   settings  (Florida,  2005;  Lachman  et  al.,  2015).  As  cities  welcome  more  residents,  land  supply   becomes  scarce  resulting  in  higher  land  values.  Due  to  Smart  Growth  policy,  development   trends,  scarce  land  supply,  and  constrained  municipal  budgets,  cities  are  looking  to  fully   optimize  the  spaces  within  their  boundaries.   It  is  within  this  urban  context  that  municipalities  are  being  called  to  explore  air  rights   development  (Beyer,  2014;  Nursall,  2014;  Edmonton,  2015).  Air  rights  development  (ARD)   achieves  a  number  of  Smart  Growth  principles,  coincides  with  current  market  demands,   optimizes  a  city's  land  supply,  and  acts  as  a  land  value  capture  tool  to  secure  revenues.     Public  entities  are  beginning  to  explore  various  land  value  capture  tools  to  address  their   financially-strained  budgets.  Land  value  capture  is  the  "identification  and  capture  of  the   increase  in  land  value  resulting  from  public  investment  in  infrastructure"  (Mathur  &  Smith,   2012,  p.1).  The  Center  for  Transportation  Studies  at  the  University  of  Minnesota  released  a   report  comparing  the  various  value  capture  tools  available  for  transportation  finance  (Lari  et  al.,   2009).  The  land  value  capture  tools  were  evaluated  on  efficiency,  equity,  sustainability,  and   feasibility.  In  their  evaluation,  air  rights  was  found  to  be  highly  efficient,  as  it  is:   ·   ·   ·   ·   a  market-based  strategy;     highly  equitable,  as  those  who  benefit  from  ARD  pay  for  the  benefit;     moderately  sustainable,  as  it  is  linked  to  market  factors;  and     moderately  feasible,  depending  on  the  political  climate  and  administrative  capabilities.    

For  a  comparison  of  air  rights  with  other  land  value  capture  tools,  see  Appendix  A.   While  more  and  more  cities  are  implementing  or  exploring  ARD,  this  type  of  development  is  not   a  new  phenomenon.

1.2  History  of  Air  Rights  Development  
The  concept  of  air  rights  is  based  in  the  maxim  cujus  est  solum,  ejus  est  usque  ad  coelom,  which   translates  to:  `whomever  the  soil  belongs,  he  owns  also  to  the  sky  and  the  depths'.  The  phrase   is  credited  to  Accursius  in  English  law  during  the  13th  century,  though  some  argue  that  the   maxim  has  roots  in  Roman  and  Jewish  ancient  law  (Abramovitch,  1961).  The  historical   applications  of  the  maxim  typically  regulated  the  digging  of  wells  or  development  over  tombs,   but  later  was  used  to  define  property  ownership  in  English  law  (Abramovitch,  1961).     The  first  evidence  of  ARD  is  the  Ponte  de  Vecchio  in  14th  century  Florence,  where  merchants   developed  structures  on  the  bridge  that  crosses  the  Arno  River  (Lillie,  1964).  A  similar   development  occurred  in  Paris  with  the  Pont  Au  Change  over  the  Seine  River.  This  ARD  featured   mixed-use  development  with  shops  at  the  ground  level  and  residences  above  (it  was  also  the   site  of  Inspector  Javert's  tragic  death  in  Hugo's  Les  Miserables).  Unfortunately,  an  edict  ordered   the  development  to  be  demolished  in  1786  (Parsons,  2001).     In  North  America,  the  pioneering  project  that  set  the  trend  for  ARD  occurred  in  New  York  City   with  the  Park  Avenue  development  over  the  New  York  Central  Terminal  in  1913.  The  chief   engineer  of  the  New  York  Central  and  Hudson  River  Railroad,  William  J.  Wilgus,  envisioned   buildings  above  the  Grand  Central  rail  yard,  coining  the  phrase  `thus  from  the  air  would  be   taken  wealth'  (Gray,  1998).  The  development  was  made  more  feasible  through  rail   electrification,  leading  to  lower  ventilation  requirements  (Goldschmidt,  1964).  Several   skyscrapers  have  been  built  above  the  rail  yards,  notably  the  Pan  American  Building  (now   known  as  the  MetLife  Building).  Historically,  ARD  has  mostly  occurred  over  railways  and   highways  in  North  America,  due  to  the  central  location  of  the  transportation  routes  where  high   land  values  justify  the  added  economic  costs  of  ARD  (Lillie,  1964).  Today,  however,   development  has  occurred  over  a  wide  variety  of  public  assets.   In  the  Canadian  context,  there  are  several  examples  of  ARD.  Vancouver  has  seen  development   of  the  air  space  above/below  its  SkyTrain  infrastructure,  Ottawa's  Lansdowne  Park   redevelopment  utilizes  air  rights,  parking  lots  have  been  built  over  downtown  rail  tracks  in   Calgary,  and  Place  Bonaventure  and  Place  Ville  Marie  are  built  over  Canadian  National  rail

tracks  in  Montreal.  The  Toronto  Parking  Authority  frequently  sells  air  rights  in  the   redevelopment  of  its  surface  parking  lots.  The  City  of  Toronto  proposed  a  large  17-hectare  ARD   project  in  South  Parkdale  over  the  rail  and  highway  corridors,  however  the  plans  have  since   been  abandoned  (Toronto,  1980).  Further  developments  above  Toronto's  transit  infrastructure   (Hall,  2002)  and  other  developments  over  Toronto's  central  rail  corridor  have  been  proposed   (Rider,  2012),  but  ARD  has  not  been  prominent,  likely  explained  by  the  challenges  of  ARD  as   outlined  in  Section  1.5.  Finally,  in  2015  the  City  of  Edmonton  released  a  report  exploring  ARD   opportunities  above  LRT  stations,  leading  to  further  examination  in  2016  (Edmonton,  2015).

A  basic  definition  of  ARD  is  the  development  of  air  space  above  or  below  a  parcel  of  land's   primary  use  (New  York,  2008).  In  other  words,  new  `land'  is  created  where  the  space  around  an   asset  is  utilized  as  buildable  space.  As  mentioned  previously,  the  development  above/below   assets  typically  involve  railways  and  expressways,  but  can  include  streets,  parking  lots,  canals,   or  public  buildings  (i.e.  stations,  libraries,  schools,  offices).   This  definition  of  ARD  has  multiple  applications.  Cities  have  implemented  transferable   development  rights  (TDR),  where  density  and  height  is  reallocated  from  one  structure  to   another.  This  can  be  an  effective  preservation  technique  for  heritage  buildings,  agricultural   land,  and  natural  areas  by  providing  a  source  of  revenue  for  landowners  (Bozung,  1985).  For   more  information  on  TDR,  see  Costonis  (1973),  Pedowitz  (1974),  Bozung  (1985),  Goelman   (1999),  and  Kwasniak  (2005).     Another  popular  application  is  constructing  a  deck  over  transportation  routes  to  create  green   spaces  above,  referred  to  as  `cap  parks'.  There  have  been  several  successful  cap  parks,  including   Boston's  Rose  Fitzgerald  Kennedy  Greenway  and  Seattle's  Freeway  Park.  Further  proposed  cap   parks  include  a  park  over  Freeway  101  in  Los  Angeles  (Park  101,  2015)  and  a  park  over  the  I-35   in  Austin  (Reconnect  Austin,  n.d.).  Air  rights  are  secured  for  pedestrian  connections  between   buildings  over  streets,  such  as  Edmonton's  City  Centre  Mall  or  Calgary's  +15  network.  Finally,   governments  have  integrated  various  public  facilities  and  uses  with  one  another.  For  example,

Calgary's  new  central  library  will  encapsulate  an  active  LRT  line,  scheduled  to  open  in  2018   (CMLC,  n.d.).     While  all  of  these  are  useful  applications,  these  types  of  ARD  will  not  be  the  focus  of  this  report.   That  being  said,  some  of  the  topics  covered  may  be  relevant  to  the  above  applications.   Instead,  this  report  will  focus  on  arguably  the  most  complicated  form  of  ARD,  which  is  private   market  development  of  buildable  space  directly  above/below  public  assets.  ARD  can  occur  over   public  assets  such  as  infrastructure,  buildings,  and  lands  that  belong  to  public  entities.  This   paper  speaks  to  a  wide  range  of  ARD  projects,  but  specific  comments  will  be  provided  for   projects  that  require  decking,  as  these  are  significant  opportunities  with  significant  challenges.     In  regards  to  terminology  used  in  this  paper,  public  entity  is  a  general  term  that  encompasses   any  public  body,  including  municipalities,  higher  orders  of  government,  public  transportation   providers,  public  utility  organizations,  or  other  government  agencies.  Development  agreement   refers  to  the  contract  between  the  landowner  and  developer,  that  specifies  the  transaction  and   stipulations  in  the  private  acquisition  of  public  air  space.  Master  plans  encompass  any  planning   or  policy  document  created  by  the  local  jurisdiction,  including  official  or  neighbourhood  plans.   Finally,  this  type  of  development  can  be  referred  to  as  air  space  development,  vertical  air  rights,   or  overbuilding.  For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  this  report  will  use  the  term  ARD.  While  this  type  of   ARD  is  the  most  complex,  it  also  has  significant  benefits  for  public  entities.  

1.4  Benefits  of  Air  Rights  Development  
The  benefits  and  challenges  associated  with  private  market  development  of  buildable  space   around  public  assets  were  analyzed  in  previous  work  by  the  author  (Bunio,  2015).  The  benefits   of  ARD  can  be  categorized  within  the  three  pillars  of  sustainability:  environmental,  social,  and   economic.  Although  separated  into  categories,  many  of  the  benefits  crossover  between  pillars.   Environmental   Encourages  a  more  compact  and  sustainable  urban  form  while  avoiding  sprawling  development.

Directing  growth  within  existing  urban  areas  and  integrating  development  with  transportation   infrastructure  supports  a  number  of  Smart  Growth  principles  (Campbell,  2004).  By  doing  so,   land  and  services  are  more  efficiently  utilized,  creating  what  Savvides  (2002)  calls  an  `economy   of  space'.  Furthermore,  with  greater  demand  for  higher  density  areas  and  the  continual  growth   of  cities,  ARD  accommodates  future  populations  in  a  sustainable  way  (New  York,  2008).   Reduces  the  environmental  impact  of  major  transportation  routes.   Major  transportation  routes,  particularly  highways,  emit  exhaust  fumes  that  decrease  the   surrounding  air  quality.  The  required  ventilation  within  the  platform  of  an  ARD  project  has  the   opportunity  to  capture  or  treat  exhaust  fumes,  thereby  improving  the  surrounding  air  quality.   Additionally,  the  platform  can  mitigate  negative  impacts  such  as  noise  and  vibration.     Provides  density  to  support  the  transit  network.   ARD  involving  transit  infrastructure  facilitates  direct  integration  of  other  uses  with  public   transit,  thereby  improving  transit  access  (New  York,  2008).  This  access  increases  ridership  and   reduces  reliance  on  the  automobile  for  transportation,  thus  reducing  greenhouse  gas   emissions.  Additionally,  the  increased  density  and  ridership  result  in  greater  fare  revenues,   thereby  supporting  the  transit  network  (Lari  et  al.,  2009).   Social   Reconnects  neighbourhoods  and  the  urban  fabric  divided  by  transportation  routes.   As  mentioned  in  Section  1.1,  urban  renewal  initiatives  saw  expressways  cutting  through  inner- city  areas.  The  platform  above  these  expressways  and  other  divisive  transportation  routes  such   as  railways,  facilitates  connectivity  between  the  neighbourhoods  on  either  side.  Therefore,  the   misfortunes  of  urban  renewal  projects  may  be  reversed  through  ARD  opportunities  (Campbell,   2004;  Pine,  1970).     Facilitates  increased  connectivity  within  the  transportation  network.   Similar  to  the  above  benefit,  decking  across  transportation  routes  creates  the  opportunity  to   complete  the  local  road  network,  thereby  increasing  connectivity  and  reducing  congestion  in

neighbourhoods.  Additionally,  the  increased  connectivity  of  the  local  road  network  facilitates   faster  response  times  for  emergency  vehicles  (Pine,  1970).   Provides  opportunity  to  improve  transportation  infrastructure.   It  is  common  to  integrate  ARD  with  transportation  improvements.  The  required  route  closures   allow  for  development  of  both  the  transportation  infrastructure  below  and  the  structures   above.  Furthermore,  ARD  agreements  can  include  funding  for,  or  construction  of,  transit   infrastructure  by  the  developer  (Hauser,  1989).  These  transportation  improvements  allow  for   better  connectivity  and  reduced  congestion  at  the  local  and  city  scale,  and  may  be  a  boon  for   the  local  economy.     Increases  safety  by  providing  separate  crossings  for  pedestrians,  cyclists,  and  vehicles.   The  addition  of  separate  crossings  along  the  ARD  platform  reduces  conflict  between  the   transportation  uses  below  and  those  trying  to  cross  (Lillie,  1964).  This  increases  safety  for  all   transportation  modes.   Accommodates  growth  without  physical  displacement  of  surrounding  residents.     Unlike  the  urban  renewal  initiatives  that  displaced  inner-city  residents,  redevelopment  occurs   on  newly  created  land.  Relocation  may  be  required  for  the  supports  or  access,  and  an  ARD   investment  may  raise  surrounding  land  values  that  price  out  renters  in  the  area.  However,  for   the  most  part,  displacement  of  existing  residents  does  not  occur  with  ARD  (Campbell,  2004).   Revitalizes  existing  and  surrounding  areas.   ARD  has  the  potential  to  raise  surrounding  land  values,  stimulating  growth  in  sections  of  the   city  and  can  be  targeted  to  higher-need  areas  (Campbell,  2004;  Lillie,  1964).  Savvides  (2002)   reveals  these  revitalization  impacts  where  ARD  has  been  proven  to  raise  household  income,   household  value,  and  rental  value.  It  should  be  noted  that  there  is  a  debate  around  whether   raising  local  land  values  has  positive  or  negative  impacts.

Creates  new  amenities  for  existing  and  future  residents.   As  with  any  new  development,  municipalities  are  able  to  secure  local  amenities.  ARD  is  able  to   provide  new  amenities  in  an  existing  area  that  has  a  shortage  of  land  (Campbell,  2004).  These   new  amenities  can  address  park/open  space  deficiencies,  affordable  housing,  retail  or   commercial  needs,  and  employment  opportunities.  The  creation  of  new  land  also  provides   flexibility  for  public  facility  siting,  thereby  increasing  access  to  public  services  (New  York,  2008).   Economic   Possesses  several  locational  advantages.   The  sites  that  are  most  feasible  for  ARD  are  located  above  transportation  routes  in  central   areas.  As  a  result,  new  development  in  these  areas  will  likely  be  in  proximity  to  employment,   commercial,  and  various  cultural  destinations.  Additionally,  ARD  integrated  with  transportation   uses  will  have  direct  access  to  these  modes,  further  increasing  the  sites  desirability.  Therefore,   ARD  sites  are  likely  to  have  high  market  demand,  increasing  marketability  for  the  developer  and   raising  revenue  potential  for  the  public  entity  landowner  (Lillie,  1964).   ARD  structures  possess  high  visibility.   Another  benefit  of  being  located  above  transportation  routes  is  the  exposure  to  high  traffic   volumes  and  being  located  within  significant  view  corridors  (Lillie,  1964).  This  high  visibility   increases  market  demand  for  the  project,  along  with  the  opportunity  to  create  landmark   buildings  to  advance  the  city's  image.   Can  provide  the  last  large  development  opportunities  in  downtown  areas.   Many  downtowns  of  large,  thriving  cities  have  few  underutilized  sites.  Additionally,  assembling   small  land  parcels  from  multiple  landowners  in  these  areas  can  be  extremely  difficult,  thereby   limiting  development  opportunities.  However,  ARD  can  provide  large  tracts  of  new  land  without   the  need  for  extensive  land  assembly  or  dealing  with  multiple  landowners  (Campbell,  2004;   Lillie,  1964).  ARD  opens  up  large-scale  development  opportunities  so  that  central  areas  can   continue  to  grow  and  accommodate  future  populations.

Air  Rights  Development  and  Public  Assets   Supports  the  private  market.  

  

Nathan  Bunio,  April  2016  

By  involving  the  private  market  in  the  development  of  public  air  space,  ARD  can  have  several   economic  spin-offs  (Campbell,  2004).  These  include  business  opportunities  for  developers  and   financial  institutions,  and  employment  opportunities  for  construction  workers,  planning  and   engineering  firms,  and  real-estate  agencies.   Decking  reduces  the  transportation  corridor's  exposure  to  weather  events,  thereby  increasing   service  reliability  and  reducing  maintenance  costs.   The  deck  of  an  ARD  provides  the  uses  below  protection  from  the  elements  (New  York,  2008).   During  extreme  weather  events  such  as  heavy  snowfalls,  transportation  uses  are  unaffected   below  the  deck  of  an  ARD.  Additionally,  the  wear  and  tear  caused  by  weathering  is  reduced  by   this  protective  deck,  decreasing  maintenance  costs  of  the  infrastructure  below.   Adds  property  tax  value  from  land  that  previously  did  not  generate  tax  revenue.   Transportation  and  other  utility  corridors  are  usually  publicly  owned  and  therefore  do  not   generate  property  tax  revenue.  However,  by  selling  air  space  above  these  public  assets,  tax   value  is  created,  either  through  property  taxes  or  payments  in  lieu  of  taxes,  thereby  increasing   revenue  for  local  governments  (Lillie,  1964).   Leverages  public  investments  as  a  land  value  capture  tool.   Public  investments,  whether  in  transit,  transportation,  or  other  categories,  typically  cause   surrounding  land  values  to  rise.  By  using  ARD  as  a  land  value  capture  tool,  public  entities  who   made  the  investment  are  able  to  capture  part  of  this  land  value  increase  and  generate  revenue   (Savvides,  2002).  Securing  this  revenue  stream  increases  the  financial  sustainability  of  the   public  investment  and  reduces  the  life  cycle  costs  of  the  infrastructure.  Cervero  (1994)  notes   that  for  transportation  agencies  involved  with  ARD,  air  rights  revenues  are  very  small  relative  to   the  transit  budgets  and  cannot  be  expected  to  be  a  significant  contributor.  However,  air  rights   can  be  used  to  finance  transportation  improvements  such  as  new  stations,  and  as  public   entities  become  more  familiar  with  air  rights,  these  types  of  revenues  are  expected  to  increase   (Lari  et  al.,  2009).

Despite  the  multitude  of  benefits  that  are  associated  with  ARD,  there  are  several  complexities   that  come  with  this  type  of  development.    

1.5  Challenges  of  Air  Rights  Development  
Providing  development  opportunities  around  public  assets  involve  a  variety  of  complexities  that   often  thwart  ARD  proposals.  These  challenges  include  economic,  political,  and  community   factors,  with  unique  complexities  associated  with  ARD  projects  that  require  decking.     Higher  construction  costs  compared  to  terra  firma  development.   From  the  scan  of  literature  and  jurisdictional  documents,  the  challenge  that  was  often  at  the   forefront  was  the  economic  cost  of  ARD  involving  a  deck.  Construction  costs  of  building  a  deck   range  between  $300  and  $700  per  square  foot  (Campbell,  2004;  New  York,  2008).  The  cost  is   largely  influenced  by  the  density  of  development  above  the  deck.  Boston's  Turnpike  Air  Rights   guidelines  (BRA,  1998)  estimate  a  deck  span  of  48  to  80  feet  will  cost  $250  to  $325/sq  ft  for  a  5- storey  structure,  and  $575  to  $850/sq  ft  for  a  35-storey  structure  (adjusted  for  2016  American   dollars).  Further  costs  may  be  encountered  for  drainage,  lighting,  and  ventilation  (Lillie,  1964).   The  BRA  (1998)  estimates  that  these  additional  costs  of  lighting,  ventilation,  signage,  and   maintenance  can  be  an  additional  $100  to  $200/sq  ft  (adjusted  for  2016  American  dollars).  The   high  cost  of  building  the  deck  needs  to  be  offset  by  increased  densities,  large  development   sites,  and  high  market  returns  to  ensure  an  appropriate  return  on  investment.     Unique  challenges  to  deck  construction.   Developers  may  experience  conditions  that  cause  deck  construction  to  be  increasingly   challenging,  increasingly  expensive,  or  even  impossible.  These  challenges  can  include  existing   structures  that  protrude  into  the  deck  plane,  erratic  topography,  or  limited  space  for  supporting   columns  (New  York,  2008).   Involves  complicated  engineering,  legal,  and  architecture  components.   In  addition  to  the  hard  costs,  there  are  also  soft  costs.  Added  engineering  costs  for  the   structural  platform  and  foundations,  legal  costs  for  the  complex  title  instruments  and  the

negotiation  of  development  agreements,  and  architectural  costs  for  the  design  challenges  of   the  structures  are  encountered  in  ARD  (Lillie,  1964).  In  regards  to  timelines,  the  increased   complexities  tend  to  increase  the  design  phase  by  20%,  and  the  construction  period  is  extended   by  another  year  when  compared  to  conventional  development  (Campbell,  2004).   Limited  to  areas  with  high  land  values.   The  added  costs  associated  with  an  ARD  project  necessitate  high  surrounding  land  values.  This   is  known  as  the  `economic  threshold',  where  surrounding  land  values  exceed  the  cost  of  the   ARD  project  (Hauser,  1989).  If  surrounding  values  do  not  exceed  the  costs  of  ARD,  then  the   developer  will  likely  opt  for  building  on  a  regular  parcel  instead  of  incurring  the  costs  of   developing  air  space.  These  necessary  high  land  values  will  limit  the  amount  of  appropriate   locations  for  ARD,  especially  in  small-  to  mid-size  cities.   Required  high  densities  of  ARD  may  cause  conflict  with  surrounding  residents.   To  offset  the  costs  of  ARD,  developers  need  to  have  sufficient  density  to  ensure  a  profit.   However,  the  height  and  massing  of  buildings  are  common  concerns  of  surrounding  residents   (Savvides,  2002).  Community  opposition  to  an  ARD  project  can  be  a  major  deterrent  to  the   proposal's  approval,  and  may  inhibit  the  density  needed  to  make  the  project  feasible.   Financing  for  ARD  projects  can  be  challenging.   Financial  institutions  may  be  less  likely  to  support  ARD  projects  due  to  their  unconventional   nature  and  the  lack  of  precedents  within  a  city  (Campbell,  2004).  This  struggle  has  been  evident   in  the  Fenway  Center  ARD  in  Boston,  where  the  developer  lost  its  initial  financing  for  the   development  and  the  project's  future  remains  uncertain  (Ross,  2014).     Appraising  air  space  is  a  difficult  process  and  can  be  a  source  of  contention.   Typical  land  valuation  methods  of  terra  firma  developments  do  not  apply  to  ARD  due  to  a   number  of  factors.  These  include  cost  of  the  platform,  maintenance  of  platform,  limited   expansion  or  improvement  opportunities,  and  inability  of  reselling  the  land  in  a  lease   agreement  (Lillie,  1964).  This  unfamiliarity  and  lack  of  an  established  air  rights  appraisal  process

may  lead  to  contention,  require  a  significant  negotiation  process,  and  ultimately  deter  private   market  investment.   Compatibility  between  ground  and  air  space  uses.   With  at  least  two  different  owners  and  different  uses  within  an  ARD,  these  uses  must  be   compatible  or  have  appropriate  measures  in  place  so  as  not  to  impede  each  other  (Lillie,  1964).   This  is  especially  true  for  ARD  projects  above  transportation  routes  where  the  movement  of   traffic  must  not  be  impeded  by  construction  and  development  activities  above,  which  likely   requires  a  number  of  safety  and  risk  management  measures.  Finally,  accommodating  the  future   expansion  needs  of  both  the  ground  and  air  space  parcels  may  be  a  limiting  factor  within  an   ARD  agreement.   Lack  of  a  clear  implementation  structure  around  ARD.   Since  ARD  may  be  unfamiliar  to  cities  with  a  lack  of  precedents,  public  entities  may  not  have   the  legislation,  policies,  and  procedures  needed  to  facilitate  ARD  (Williams  &  McNichol,  1973).   There  also  may  be  bureaucratic  resistance  to  an  unfamiliar  and  complex  form  of  development   such  as  ARD  (Toronto  Star,  2014).  Unfamiliarity  with  ARD  may  also  be  evident  within  the  local   development  industry,  adding  further  challenges  to  ARD  implementation.   This  implementation  handbook  on  ARD  seeks  to  directly  address  the  last  challenge  mentioned.   While  public  entities  do  not  have  control  over  market  conditions,  they  should  have  an  effective   implementation  structure  in  place  to  accommodate  ARD  for  when  the  opportunity  arises.  The   challenges  and  the  corresponding  solutions  will  be  explored  through  the  research  questions.  

1.6  Research  Questions  and  Methodology  
This  report  explores  the  different  ways  that  a  public  entity  can  address  the  challenges  and   complexities  associated  with  ARD  noted  above  in  order  to  build  an  effective  implementation   structure.  This  report  will  be  guided  by  three  research  questions:   ·   What  is  the  role  of  public  entities  within  ARD?     ·   What  options  are  available  to  address  these  complexities  in  order  to  build  an  effective   implementation  structure  for  ARD?

·   What  are  the  steps  public  entities  should  take  in  order  to  build  an  effective   implementation  structure  around  ARD?   This  ARD  implementation  handbook  analyzes  the  considerations  within  an  implementation   structure,  and  details  the  options  available  to  address  specific  complexities  from  a  public   entity's  perspective.  For  this  exploratory  research,  the  report  used  a  mixed-method  approach  in   its  methodology.  This  included  an  academic  literature  scan,  which  was  completed  previously  by   the  author  (Bunio,  2015).  Additionally,  the  methodology  included  a  jurisdictional  scan  of   selected  case  studies  and  the  relevant  institutional  literature  on  the  various  implementation   structures.  Informational  interviews  were  conducted  to  ensure  accuracy  of  information.  

1.7  Selected  Case  Studies  
Cities  that  have  implemented  ARD  will  typically  possess  general  characteristics  of  being  large  in   size,  having  a  shortage  of  land  at  key  locations,  and  containing  barriers  such  as  geographic   landforms  or  transportation  routes  (Lillie,  1964).  The  literature  scan  revealed  several   municipalities  implementing  ARD.  North  American  municipalities  were  focused  on  for  the   consistency  of  urban  contexts.  To  further  narrow  down  the  municipalities,  a  set  of  criteria  was   developed  in  order  to  select  the  case  studies  for  this  report:     ·   The  case  studies  must  have  constructed  an  ARD  project  in  the  past.  There  are  many   cities  looking  at  ARD  or  have  proposals,  but  only  cities  that  have  built  or  are  in  the   process  of  constructing  an  ARD  project  were  chosen.     ·   Cities  must  have  identifiable  policies  and  processes  around  ARD.  These  policy   documents  are  needed  to  obtain  information  on  the  implementation  structures.     ·   Case  studies  selected  must  contain  a  diversity  of  models.  This  includes  at  least  one   Canadian  and  one  American  city,  models  that  are  more  proactive  or  reactive  in  their   approach,  and  other  differences  between  the  implementation  structures.  The  diversity   of  models  provides  a  wide  range  of  potential  solutions  to  the  associated  ARD  issues.     Based  on  these  criteria,  four  primary  case  studies  were  chosen.  Table  2  provides  the  city   regions  and  a  few  examples  of  ARD  projects  that  were  involved  in  the  analysis.

1.8  Purpose  and  Scope  
As  mentioned  in  the  definition  section,  this  report  focuses  on  private  market  development  of   buildable  space  directly  above/below  public  assets,  including  specific  comments  on  decking   projects.  The  report  seeks  to  create  a  handbook  for  public  entities  to  address  ARD  issues  and   help  build  an  effective  implementation  structure.  The  literature  scan  previously  completed   (Bunio,  2015)  revealed  the  various  issues  of  ARD  that  a  public  entity  can  influence.  The  issues   are  separated  into  four  categories  with  further  subcategories,  which  are  detailed  in  Table  3:

implementation  structure,  and  to  help  find  the  best  implementation  structure  within  their  local   context.  By  establishing  regulations  and  policies  around  the  various  issues,  the  public  entity   builds  administrative  capacity  and  becomes  more  familiar  with  ARD,  helping  to  reduce  any   bureaucratic  resistance.  Predictability  around  ARD  is  also  enhanced,  which  in  turn  will  help   community  residents  and  developers  understand  ARD,  leading  to  smoother  approvals,  lower   economic  costs,  and  less  contention  surrounding  ARD  projects.  Overall,  public  entities  will  be  in   a  better  position  to  capitalize  on  ARD  opportunities  when  conditions  are  favourable.   The  end  goal  of  this  report  is  to  create  a  handbook  detailing  the  steps  taken  to  build  an   effective  ARD  implementation  structure,  providing  an  overview  of  the  considerations,  issues,   and  options  that  public  entities  have  to  facilitate  this  form  of  development.  The  audience  for   this  handbook  is  public  entities  that  are  looking  to  initiate  their  own  ARD  implementation   structure  or  to  refine  their  existing  structure.  The  handbook  will  serve  as  a  resource  of   information,  and  as  an  initial  step  to  create  best  practices  around  ARD  implementation.

2.0  Political  Issues  
The  political  considerations  of  ARD  involve  the  bureaucratic  structure  and  the  coordination   between  public  entities.  The  expectations,  roles,  and  responsibilities  of  each  public  entity   should  be  identifiable  for  both  the  developer  and  the  general  public.  This  will  bring   predictability  to  the  ARD  implementation  process,  increasing  the  likelihood  of  an  ARD  project   being  built.  This  section  looks  at  how  public  entities  should  organize  themselves  and  how  they   should  interact  with  one  another  within  the  ARD  implementation  process.  Specifically,  this   section  examines  the  organizational  structure  of  the  public  entity,  inter-governmental   coordination,  benefit-sharing  amongst  public  entities,  and  locating  ARD  opportunities.  

2.1  Organizational  Structure  of  Public  Entity  
One  of  the  first  steps  to  creating  an  implementation  structure  is  to  determine  the  team  that  will   oversee  ARD  proposals.  Since  ARD  involves  a  wide  range  of  complexities,  the  committee  that  is   tasked  with  overseeing  ARD  should  include  an  inter-disciplinary  team  of  planners,  architects,   engineers,  lawyers,  and  economists  (Savvides,  2002).  However,  the  organizational  structure  will   be  different  for  the  various  public  entities  involved,  including  higher  orders  of  government  (i.e.   federal,  provincial/state),  municipalities,  and  government  agencies  (i.e.  transit).   Federal  and  Provincial/State  Structures   Within  the  higher  orders  of  government,  overseeing  ARD  projects  is  typically  delegated  to   established  subsidiaries  or  municipal  governments.  For  the  most  part,  there  was  limited   evidence  of  separate  structures  within  these  higher  order  governments  that  were  responsible   for  ARD  implementation.     An  example  of  a  federal  body  that  is  involved  in  ARD  is  the  Federal  Highway  Administration   (FHWA),  which  is  a  part  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation.  Within  the  FHWA,  there  is  an   Office  of  Planning,  Environmental,  &  Realty  which  is  responsible  for  overseeing  ARD  projects   over  the  Interstate  highway  network.  Since  transportation  infrastructure  usually  involve  land   holdings,  it  is  common  for  transportation  providers  to  have  a  committee  responsible  for  its  real   estate  and  development  inquiries.  The  FHWA  Office  of  Planning,  Environment,  and  Realty  is

represented  by  a  wide  range  of  disciplines  including  community  planners,  environmental   scientists,  realty  specialists,  and  transportation  engineers  (FHWA,  2016).  The  Office  is   responsible  for  providing  policy,  legislation,  regulations,  and  research.   At  the  provincial/state  level,  the  organizations  that  would  be  involved  with  ARD  would  be  the   various  departments  of  transportation.  Sometimes  the  departments  of  transportation  will  be   directly  involved  with  ARD  projects,  such  as  the  Massachusetts  Department  of  Transportation   (MassDOT,  which  took  over  the  Massachusetts  Turnpike  Authority)  and  the  Virginia   Department  of  Transportation  (VDOT)  for  projects  over  highways.  In  particular,  the  VDOT  has   an  Office  of  Transportation  Public-Private  Partnerships  that  is  involved  in  ARD.  However,   typically  the  responsibility  of  overseeing  ARD  projects  is  further  delegated  to  various   government  agencies  such  as  transportation  authorities.  For  example,  TransLink  in  British   Columbia,  the  Massachusetts  Bay  Transportation  Authority  (MBTA),  and  the  Metropolitan   Transportation  Authority  (MTA)  in  New  York  oversee  ARD  as  it  involves  their  respective   infrastructure.   Government  Agencies   The  government  agencies  that  are  involved  in  ARD  are  usually  subsidiaries  of  the  province/state   but  have  independent  authority,  and  are  typically  transit  agencies.  Most  of  these  transit   agencies  are  regional  in  nature,  such  as  TransLink  serving  the  Lower  Mainland,  Washington   Metropolitan  Area  Transit  Authority  (WMATA)  with  service  across  state  boundaries,  and  the   Metropolitan  Atlanta  Rapid  Transit  Authority  (MARTA).  As  mentioned  previously,  since  these   transit  networks  have  a  series  of  land  holdings,  the  transit  agency  typically  has  some  sort  of  a   real  estate  office  that  is  responsible  for  development  of  its  land  assets,  which  includes   overseeing  ARD.  TransLink  has  a  Real  Estate  Division,  MARTA  has  an  Office  of  TOD  and  Real   Estate,  WMATA  has  an  Office  of  Real  Estate  and  Station  Planning,  and  MTA  has  a  Real  Estate   department.  These  real  estate  divisions  create  guidelines  and  regulations,  seek  developers   through  a  request  for  proposal  (RFP)  process,  and  approve  development  agreements.   Municipalities

There  are  several  models  and  options  that  cities  can  use  to  implement  and  oversee  ARD.  Some   cities  employ  their  existing  planning  offices  to  review  ARD.  In  the  1960s,  New  York  and  Chicago   used  their  planning  commissions  to  review  ARD  proposals  and  provide  recommendations  to   their  councils  (Goldschmidt,  1964).    Today,  municipalities  in  the  Lower  Mainland,  such  as   Vancouver  and  Richmond,  use  their  planning  offices  and  city  councils  to  approve  ARD.   However,  some  jurisdictions  choose  to  delegate  the  ARD  review  process  to  separate   organizations.   One  option  is  to  use  a  quasi-public  development  agency  to  be  directly  involved  in  the  approval   and  construction  of  an  ARD  project.  From  the  literature  scan,  Savvides  (2002)  suggests  that   forming  a  quasi-public  corporation  to  acquire  and  assemble  air  rights  sites  for  joint   development  projects  can  be  an  effective  method  of  managing  the  ARD  process.  In  the  Lower   Mainland,  the  City  of  Surrey  created  the  Surrey  City  Development  Corporation  (SCDC).  The   SCDC  was  responsible  for  the  Surrey  City  Centre  development,  which  involved  selling  air  rights.   Using  a  quasi-public  developer  will  provide  more  control  over  the  project;  however,  there  is   more  risk  associated  when  the  success  of  a  public  investment  is  dependent  on  the  market   response.   Other  municipalities  have  committees  that  approve  specific  types  of  developments.  In  Boston,   the  Boston  Redevelopment  Authority  (BRA)  is  the  city's  urban  planning  and  economic   development  agency  consisting  of  a  wide  range  of  professions.  The  BRA  is  responsible  for   reviewing  large  and  small  scale  development  projects  between  20,000  to  over  50,000  sq  ft,  new   overlay  zoning  districts  (planned  development  areas),  and  institutional  master  plans  (i.e.  post- secondary,  hospitals).  These  development  types  have  a  specific  review  process  outlined  in   Article  80  of  the  Zoning  Code.  The  BRA  reviews  ARD  projects  in  a  similar  manner  to  the  process   required  under  Article  80.  As  per  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  signed  in  1997   between  the  Massachusetts  Turnpike  Authority  (now  MassDOT)  and  the  City  of  Boston,  the   BRA  is  responsible  for  design  review  of  ARD  over  Boston's  Turnpike.  The  BRA  also  acts  as  a   liaison  between  the  various  City  of  Boston  departments  within  the  proposal  review,  and   initiates  the  community  review  process  (MassDOT,  2014).  The  benefit  of  this  structure  is  that

the  developer  deals  with  one  municipal  agency  and  only  needs  to  submit  a  single  set  of   documents  within  the  municipal  approval  process  (BRA,  2015).   Washington  D.C.  has  a  similar  structure.  The  Zoning  Commission  (ZC)  is  quasi-judicial  body  that   oversees  preparation,  adoption,  and  amendments  to  the  Zoning  Regulation,  campus  plans,   planned  unit  developments  (provides  zoning  flexibility  in  exchange  for  density  bonuses),  and  air   rights  development  in  public  space  (District  of  Columbia  OP,  n.d.).  The  Office  of  Planning,  which   is  a  municipal  department,  works  closely  with  the  applicant  on  an  ARD  proposal  and  provides   support  or  recommendations  to  the  Zoning  Commission,  who  then  is  responsible  for  approving   the  proposal.  Both  the  BRA  and  ZC  have  authority  to  approve  ARD  proposals,  with  ARD  being   one  of  multiple  development  application  types  that  these  bodies  review.   In  New  York,  special-purpose  bodies  were  created  for  the  Hudson  Yards  redevelopment  due  to   its  scale;  it  is  one  of  the  largest  private  real  estate  developments  in  U.S.  history  (Hudson  Yards,   2016).  The  City  of  New  York  established  the  Hudson  Yards  Development  Corporation  (HYDC)   which  oversees  the  implementation  of  the  City's  Hudson  Yards  development  program  with   direction  from  New  York  city  council.  The  HYDC  is  made  up  of  planning,  development,  and   construction  specialists,  and  acts  as  a  liaison  between  the  various  City  departments  and  State   entities,  including  the  MTA,  that  are  involved  in  the  project's  financing,  planning,  development,   and  construction  (HYDC,  2015).  The  board  of  the  HYDC  includes  the  Deputy  Mayor  for   Operations,  various  City  department  commissioners,  and  community  representatives.  The  City   of  New  York  also  created  the  Hudson  Yards  Infrastructure  Corporation  (HYIC),  which  acts  as  a   local  development  corporation  that  finances  specific  acquisition  and  infrastructure  work  (HYIC,   2014).  The  Hudson  Yards  project  involves  multiple  large-scale  public  amenity  projects,  including   the  Line  7  subway  extension  and  public  parks,  which  are  financed  by  bonds  and  recovered   through  future  development  revenues.  In  short,  the  HYIC  acts  as  the  bank  for  specific   improvements  and  the  HYDC  oversees  the  planning  and  development  of  the  project.   The  choice  for  the  appropriate  organizational  structure  will  depend  on  existing  structures  in   place,  the  public  entity's  resources,  and  the  scale  of  the  ARD  project.  If  there  is  a  separate   committee  that  reviews  more  specialized  development  proposals,  such  as  the  BRA  or  ZC,  then  it

would  be  advisable  to  use  that  committee  for  ARD  review.  For  large  scale  projects  that  are  of   particular  interest  to  the  municipality  and  require  public  financing,  employing  special-purpose   bodies  or  the  municipality's  quasi-public  developer  would  be  effective.  Finally,  for  any   government  agency  or  municipality  that  has  a  series  of  land  holdings,  having  some  sort  of  real   estate  division  would  be  beneficial  to  maximize  its  land  assets,  including  exploring  ARD   opportunities.   Overall,  the  public  entity  needs  to  clarify  which  committee  within  the  organization  is   responsible  for  reviewing  ARD  proposals.  Furthermore,  the  responsible  committee  should  act   as  a  liaison  between  the  developer  and  other  public  entities.  This  facilitates  a  smoother  ARD   implementation  process  and  is  also  important  for  coordination  between  public  entities.  

2.2  Inter-Governmental  Coordination  
After  the  respective  organizational  structures  have  been  created,  it  is  important  to  determine   how  these  public  entities  work  together,  establishing  roles  and  responsibilities  early  on  in  the   process  (Goldschmidt,  1964).  The  province/state  and  municipalities  will  consistently  have  a   regulatory  role  within  ARD  projects  just  as  they  do  in  any  other  development,  although  in   different  capacities.  Government  agencies  will  be  involved  if  the  project  relates  to  their   respective  landholdings  or  infrastructure.     While  the  higher  order  governments  play  a  role  in  ARD  implementation,  a  significant   relationship  is  between  the  government  agency  and  the  municipality.  A  partnership  between   these  two  entities  is  critical  to  the  success  of  an  ARD  project.  Roles  need  to  be  clearly  defined   between  these  two  entities.  Additionally,  the  question  of  which  regulations  apply  to  the  ARD   project  has  been  a  source  of  contention  in  the  past,  resulting  in  a  major  obstacle  to  ARD   implementation.   The  contention  of  applicable  regulations  arises  from  the  government  agency  being  a  subsidiary   of  the  province/state.  In  the  Canadian  context,  municipalities  are  `creatures  of  the  province',   implying  that  the  province  supersedes  the  powers  of  the  municipality.  A  similar  government   hierarchy  is  seen  in  the  United  States.  Therefore,  province/state  subsidiaries  have  questioned

whether  local  regulations  apply  to  developments  involving  province/state-owned  land.  This  has   been  a  major  source  of  contention  in  Boston's  Big  Dig  Project,  causing  major  delays  in  the   approval  of  ARD.  For  development  above  the  Turnpike  in  Boston,  the  Turnpike  Authority  was   exempt  from  local  zoning  and  other  regulations  (Goldschmidt,  1964;  BRA,  1998).  Meanwhile,   pillars  for  ARD  projects  that  were  located  on  City  of  Boston  land  were  under  BRA  control,   leading  to  more  conflict  (Schulte,  2009).  For  the  first  ARD  projects  in  Boston,  local  regulations   did  not  apply,  leading  to  developments  like  the  Prudential  Center,  which  is  largely  out  of  scale   and  is  despised  by  local  residents  (BRA,  1998).   Today,  some  jurisdictions  still  refuse  to  apply  local  regulations  to  ARD.  For  example,  in  the   Miami-Dade  County,  zoning  authority  is  transferred  from  the  municipality  to  the  County  for   ARD  above  Miami-Dade  Transit  (MDT)  infrastructure  (Mathur  &  Smith,  2012).  The  argument  for   removing  local  authority  is  to  ensure  land  uses  around  MDT  infrastructure  are  coordinated   along  the  entire  corridor.  However,  shifting  authority  to  higher  levels  of  government  goes   against  the  `subsidiarity  principle',  which  states  that  effective  service  provision  requires   decision-making  to  be  done  at  the  level  of  government  closest  to  the  individual  citizen  (Slack,   2009).  In  fact,  the  Turnpike  Authority  signed  an  MOU  with  the  City  of  Boston  in  1997  that   designated  design  review  to  the  BRA  (BRA,  1998).  Local  regulations  apply  in  the  Vancouver,   New  York,  Washington  D.C.,  Minneapolis,  and  Atlanta  case  studies  as  well,  and  is  the  apparent   norm  for  ARD.  By  retaining  local  control  of  the  development,  the  approval  process  will  be   smoother  and  the  development  is  more  likely  to  integrate  with  the  surrounding  areas  to   become  a  successful  ARD  project.   An  overview  of  the  typical  roles  and  responsibilities  of  three  public  entities:  municipality,   government  agency,  and  higher  orders  of  government  (federal,  province/state)  is  provided   below.   Municipalities   It  is  common  practice  for  municipalities  to  be  responsible  for  approving  an  ARD  project  and  its   design.  The  chosen  committee  of  each  municipality  would  take  the  lead  role,  and  the  project   would  undergo  department  review  and  be  approved  by  their  respective  city  council,  similar  to

other  development  proposals.  Each  primary  case  study  had  the  municipality  outlining  the   approval  process  of  ARD,  which  makes  it  more  clear  for  developers  and  community  residents.  If   ARD  is  above/below  a  municipal  asset  or  municipally-owned  land,  then  the  appropriate   committee  would  also  be  tasked  with  creating  a  development  agreement.   Government  Agencies   ARD  above/below  infrastructure  or  land  that  belongs  to  a  government  agency  will  involve  the   appropriate  committee  within  that  organization,  most  likely  the  real  estate  division.  The   government  agency's  primary  role  is  to  select  a  developer  and  their  proposal,  and  determine   the  development  agreement,  including  the  transaction  (i.e.  lease  or  sale).  As  part  of  that   development  agreement,  government  agencies  will  likely  have  construction  guidelines  to   follow,  so  as  not  to  interrupt  service  below  and  for  safety  purposes.  For  example,  TransLink  has   Adjacent  and  Integrated  Development  Guidelines  that  regulate  the  construction  activities  of   developers  (TransLink,  n.d.b).  Similarly,  MassDOT  requires  the  proponent  to  submit  a   Construction  Management  Plan,  detailing  items  such  as  schedules  and  parking  areas  for   workers.  Government  agencies  may  also  be  active  in  preparing  their  assets  for  development.  In   Atlanta,  MARTA  has  been  involved  in  rezoning  its  land  holdings,  further  facilitating  ARD   opportunities.   Coordinated  Approach   Overall,  for  ARD  involving  a  government  agency,  the  municipality  is  primarily  responsible  for   approving  the  design  of  the  development  while  the  government  agency  is  responsible  for   approving  the  development  agreement.  This  creates  a  two-shop  stop  for  developers  interested   in  an  ARD  project,  one  at  the  government  agency  and  one  at  the  municipality.  This  is  certainly   the  case  in  Vancouver  where  there  are  two  separate  processes,  one  with  the  municipality  and   one  with  TransLink,  as  shown  in  Appendix  B.  However,  there  are  options  to  create  a  more   coordinated  approach  between  the  two  public  entities.   One  of  the  leaders  of  this  coordinated  approach  between  the  municipality  and  government   agency  is  the  WMATA  in  Washington  D.C.  The  WMATA  has  created  Joint  Development   Guidelines  (WMATA,  2013)  that  specifically  detail  the  role  that  the  municipality  plays  in  the

ARD  process.  The  Guidelines  suggest  that  the  local  jurisdiction  designate  a  person  or  office  as   the  liaison  to  the  WMATA  in  joint  development  activities.  When  exploring  sites  for  ARD   opportunities,  the  WMATA  staff  creates  a  list  of  potential  sites,  while  also  allowing  the  local   jurisdiction  to  determine  sites.  The  WMATA  then  initiates  station  planning,  which  includes   consultation  within  the  department,  community,  and  local  jurisdiction.  The  WMATA  and  the   local  jurisdiction  may  also  enter  into  an  MOU  on  outreach  procedures  moving  forward.  The   WMATA  then  looks  at  the  zoning  and  market  readiness  of  the  sites.  If  changes  to  zoning  are   needed,  then  the  WMATA  staff  will  consult  with  the  jurisdictional  representatives.  After   releasing  the  RFP  to  developers,  the  developer  must  first  meet  with  the  local  jurisdiction  before   it  submits  an  application,  and  must  include  this  consultation  as  part  of  its  proposal.  From  then   on,  the  local  jurisdiction  can  participate  in  the  developer  presentations  and  in  the  evaluation  of   the  proposals,  with  the  exception  of  financial  information  which  is  kept  confidential.  While  the   WMATA  maintains  control  over  the  development  agreement  and  the  selection  of  the   developer,  the  local  jurisdiction  is  included  throughout  the  entire  process  and  can  provide  input   on  how  the  development  agreement  is  shaped.  Additionally,  the  initial  consultations  with  the   local  jurisdiction  can  lead  to  zoning  changes  if  necessary,  providing  easier  implementation  of  an   ARD  project.  After  the  development  agreement  is  established,  the  jurisdiction  is  then   responsible  for  approving  the  project.  Overall,  the  process  becomes  streamlined  which   increases  the  likelihood  of  success.   There  are  other  examples  of  government  agencies  working  alongside  local  jurisdictions,  notably   within  the  RFP  process.  Government  agencies  in  New  York  and  Boston  both  consult  local   jurisdictions  during  the  evaluation  of  the  development  proposals.  By  having  both  parties  on  the   same  page  at  the  beginning  of  the  process,  the  implementation  of  ARD  will  be  much  smoother.   Higher  Orders  of  Government   For  a  higher  order  of  government,  since  municipalities  are  `creatures  of  the  province',  their  role   involves  delegating  powers  to  implement  ARD.  Provinces/states  will  grant  the  authority  to   government  agencies  or  municipalities  to  enter  in  ARD  agreements.  For  example,  the   Massachusetts  General  Laws  grant  the  ability  for  MassDOT  to  lease  air  rights  over  land  owned

by  the  department  (Massachusetts,  2016).  In  British  Columbia,  the  Province  grants  the   authority  to  create  air  space  parcels  above  highways  to  the  municipality  if  the  highway  land   title  is  vested  solely  in  the  municipality  (British  Columbia,  2016).  The  province/state  can  also   stipulate  that  ARD  follow  local  regulations  or  be  approved  by  the  locality.  Examples  of  this  can   be  found  in  the  Massachusetts  General  Laws  and  the  Code  of  Virginia.   Apart  from  the  delegation  role,  the  higher  orders  of  government  may  directly  be  involved  in   approving  ARD  if  it  affects  infrastructure  directly  under  their  control.  For  instance,  the  FHWA   will  approve  ARD  over  the  Interstate  highway  system,  primarily  to  ensure  development  does   not  inhibit  traffic  below.  Additionally,  environmental  reviews  may  be  required  under  the   National  Environmental  Policy  Act  and  other  legislation.  The  province/state  can  also  have  a   conflict  resolution  role  between  the  municipality  and  government  agency.  In  Boston,  the  State   Development  Cabinet  is  tasked  with  resolving  jurisdictional  disputes  (Hauser,  1989).   To  determine  what  government  agencies  and  other  landholders  should  be  involved  in  an  ARD   opportunity,  an  overview  of  ownership  within  the  site  needs  to  be  conducted.  Sometimes  a   right-of-way  (ROW)  will  have  several  government  agencies  and  easements  involved,  along  with   the  site  having  multiple  land  owners,  which  Campbell  (2004)  refers  to  as  "muddled   jurisdictional  authority"  (p.  63).  In  this  situation,  Hauser  (1989)  suggests  using  the  `master   lease'  method,  where  the  majority  stakeholder  would  take  the  lead  role  and  be  responsible  for   negotiating  the  value  of  the  air  rights  and  development  agreement.

Another  factor  that  needs  to  be  considered  by  public  entities  is  how  to  distribute  the  financial   benefits  resulting  from  ARD.  Disagreements  on  revenue  sharing  can  be  a  major  source  of   contention  between  public  entities,  and  lead  to  decreased  cooperation  which  creates  obstacles   to  ARD.  This  section  will  highlight  the  typical  distribution  of  ARD  benefits  amongst  the  affected   government  organizations.   There  are  four  types  of  benefits  that  result  from  an  ARD  project:   ·   Air  rights  valuation

·   Property  taxes   ·   Community  Amenities   ·   Density  Bonusing  and  Incremental  Land  Lift   Air  Rights  Valuation   A  revenue  stream  is  created  when  the  landowner  sells  or  leases  the  air  rights  to  a  developer,   where  the  amount  is  based  on  its  valuation.  As  noted  in  the  cujus  est  solum,  ejus  est  usque  ad   coelom  maxim,  the  owner  of  the  surface  of  the  land  also  owns  the  air  rights  above.  By  owning   the  title  to  the  land,  landowners  are  able  to  develop  the  air  space  above  and  create  density.   Therefore,  the  sale  or  lease  of  air  rights  and  the  resulting  revenues  generated  from  ARD  belong   to  the  landowner.  Since  the  landowner  receives  the  air  space  revenues,  the  development   agreement  and  transaction  (i.e.  lease  or  sale)  will  be  conducted  by  the  landowner.  If  the  ARD   site  contains  multiple  landowners,  then  the  `master  lease'  method  (Hauser,  1989)  can  be  used   to  determine  the  allocation  of  air  rights  revenues.  The  percentage  of  ownership  within  the  site   is  used  to  distribute  the  air  rights  revenues  among  the  landowners  based  on  their  proportion.   For  the  ROWs  or  easements  running  through  the  site,  the  corresponding  stakeholders  may  be   entitled  to  a  portion  of  the  air  rights  revenues.  ROWs  and  easements  are  generally  agreements   that  permit  another  party  to  use  the  landowner's  property  in  some  fashion  (ALSA,  2016).  While   not  being  able  to  sell  or  lease  the  air  space  above  the  ROW  or  easement,  these  stakeholders  are   able  to  ensure  that  surrounding  development  does  not  hamper  the  use  of  that  easement.   Therefore,  if  an  ARD  project  requires  additional  maintenance  and  operation  costs  to  protect  the   use  of  an  easement,  then  the  air  rights  revenues  need  to  be  apportioned  to  that  stakeholder  to   recover  these  costs.  This  ensures  that  ARD  does  not  violate  property  rights  and  increases  the   likelihood  that  all  stakeholders  will  cooperate  with  the  development.   There  are  some  subsidiaries  of  a  public  entity  that  have  a  level  of  independence  in  regards  to  its   operations,  but  the  landholdings  remain  under  the  ownership  of  the  public  entity.  For  example,   the  Toronto  Parking  Authority  is  a  self-sustaining  municipal  agency  that  manages  public  parking   infrastructure  in  Toronto.  The  Authority  is  involved  in  the  redevelopment  of  its  surface  parking   lots,  selling  the  air  rights  above.  However,  the  City  of  Toronto  remains  the  owner  of  the   Authority's  landholdings.  As  a  result,  there  is  an  income  sharing  agreement  between  the

Authority  and  the  City,  where  75%  of  the  net  income  total  of  ARD  belongs  to  the  City  and  the   remaining  25%  belongs  to  the  Authority  (Persiko,  2011).  Other  arrangements  involving  a   mismatch  between  ownership  and  operation  can  use  income  sharing  agreements  to  determine   revenue  distribution.   Property  Taxes   Similar  to  the  issue  of  local  regulations  being  applicable  to  ARD  above  provincial/state  assets,   local  property  taxes  have  also  been  challenged.  This  issue  has  been  seen  in  Boston  where  the   State  exempted  air  rights  from  city  property  taxes  (Frug  &  Barron,  2008).  Today,  most  ARD   projects  are  subject  to  property  taxes  that  can  generate  significant  revenues.  In  British   Columbia  under  the  Land  Title  Act  (British  Columbia,  2016),  air  space  titles  must  be  separately   assessed  for  taxation.  Additionally,  the  Massachusetts  General  Laws  ensure  tax  provision  or   payments  in  lieu  of  taxes  for  jurisdictions  involved  in  ARD  (Massachusetts,  2016).   The  property  tax  revenues  should  be  provided  to  the  local  government  (i.e.  municipality  or   county)  that  is  responsible  for  providing  the  services.  This  property  tax  revenue  is  significant  for   local  governments  because  it  creates  revenue  from  a  property  that  may  not  have  generated  tax   revenue  previously.   Community  Amenities   Just  like  any  new  development,  local  governments  can  regulate  the  provision  of  community   amenities.  These  can  include  parks  and  open  spaces,  schools,  and  cultural  spaces,  as  seen  in  the   Hudson  Yards  development  (Hudson  Yards,  2016).  In  Vancouver,  the  City  may  require  that  new   developments  transfer  an  air  space  parcel  to  the  municipality,  which  is  used  for  variety  of  public   benefits  such  as  libraries  or  day  cares  (Vancouver,  2016).  These  amenities  that  can  greatly   improve  the  services  of  the  area  and  meet  the  needs  of  residents.   Another  notable  community  benefit  is  the  provision  of  affordable  housing  through  ARD.  The   WMATA  requires  all  new  developments  above  its  Metrorail  stations  to  meet  the  affordable   housing  requirements  set  by  the  local  jurisdiction  (WMATA,  2013).  MARTA's  Transit-Oriented   Development  (TOD)  criteria  that  affect  ARD  set  a  goal  of  20%  of  units  to  be  affordable  housing

(MARTA,  2014).  Washington  D.C.'s  Capital  Crossing  will  have  30%  of  units  as  affordable  housing   (District  of  Columbia  DMPED,  n.d.).  Additionally,  the  MBTA  sold  air  rights  over  the  South  Station   Tower  in  Boston,  generating  $10  million  in  linkage  funds  to  construct  affordable  housing  (Lari  et   al.,  2009).  There  have  been  other  examples  of  linkage  in  regards  to  job  creation  in  Washington   D.C.  (District  of  Columbia  DMPED,  n.d.)  and  Minneapolis  (Minneapolis,  2014)  associated  with   ARD  projects.  This  is  a  great  example  of  inter-governmental  cooperation  wherein  the   government  agency  helps  advance  the  goals  of  the  municipality  through  ARD.  It  is   recommended  that  the  government  agency  require  ARD  to  have  community  benefits  in  order   to  foster  a  healthy  working  relationship  with  the  municipality  and  local  community.   Density  Bonusing  and  Incremental  Land  Lift   Municipalities  commonly  allow  for  increased  density  and  heights  in  exchange  for  additional   amenities  or  developer  contributions,  referred  to  as  density  bonusing.  Planned  Unit   Developments  (PUD)  in  Washington  D.C.  and  Planned  Developments  in  Boston  are  similar  tools,   where  an  overlay  allows  for  flexible  zoning  regulations  in  exchange  for  public  amenities.  Both  of   these  tools  can  be  applied  to  ARD,  with  Capital  Crossing  in  Washington  D.C.  as  a  notable   example  (Steingasser,  2010).  As  was  the  case  with  Capital  Crossing,  these  overlays  allow  for   much  needed  density  to  make  ARD  projects  economically  feasible.  This  added  density  is  likely   appropriate  if  the  ARD  site  is  located  in  a  central  area  or  above  public  transit.  In  return,   municipalities  receive  further  amenities  or  developer  contributions.   Local  jurisdictions  may  also  capture  the  incremental  land  lift  of  a  planning  decision.  In   Vancouver,  the  City  captures  the  rise  in  land  values  as  a  result  of  a  rezoning,  allowing  increased   density  through  Community  Amenity  Contributions.  This  is  seen  as  a  win-win  situation  where   the  developer  increases  its  revenues  by  selling  more  units  and  the  City  captures  a  portion  of  the   land  lift  to  provide  increased  community  amenities  (Vancouver,  2011).  To  determine  the   incremental  land  lift,  the  City  uses  a  `before  and  after'  method  where  the  value  of  the  land   before  the  rezoning  is  compared  to  the  value  after.  The  increase  in  land  value  is  then   negotiated  between  the  developer  and  the  City,  where  the  City  typically  acquires  70-80%  of  the   land  lift  (Vancouver,  2011).

Nathan  Bunio,  April  2016  

For  developments  that  integrate  with  transit  infrastructure,  the  Community  Amenity   Contributions  need  to  be  a  win-win-win  situation;  benefits  the  municipality,  developer,  and   infrastructure  owner.  For  example,  TransLink  typically  has  ROWs  and  easements  for  its  SkyTrain   lines  and  does  not  own  the  land.  For  TransLink  to  participate  in  ARD,  it  needs  to  receive  some   sort  of  benefit  from  the  project,  or  else  it  will  not  be  incentivized  to  participate  in  development   above/around  its  infrastructure.  Therefore,  Community  Amenity  Contributions  need  to  be   allocated  appropriately,  or  the  financial  benefits  that  are  secured  by  the  municipality  can  be   directly  invested  in  transportation  infrastructure  in  the  community.   In  an  alternative  scenario,  if  a  developer  proposes  direct  access  to  a  transit  station,  then  the   government  agency  can  negotiate  with  the  developer  to  capture  a  portion  of  the  land  lift  that   results  from  that  decision.  To  allocate  the  portions  of  incremental  land  lift,  the  stakeholders   that  are  responsible  for  that  land  lift  need  to  be  determined  in  isolation.  Land  lift  will  occur   because  of  a  municipal  rezoning,  while  also  occurring  because  of  a  direct  link  to  a  transit  station   approved  by  the  government  agency.  By  determining  the  land  lifts  separately,  it  is  then  clear   which  stakeholder  is  able  to  capture  the  negotiated  portion  of  that  land  lift.  Overall,  both   density  bonusing  and  incremental  land  lift  capture  can  provide  benefits  for  municipalities  and   government  agencies.   In  sum,  it  is  important  that  each  public  entity  affected  by  an  ARD  project  receive  some  form  of   the  resulting  benefits.  Without  receiving  any  kind  of  benefit,  there  is  no  reason  for  that  public   entity  to  cooperate  in  the  ARD  process.  Determining  a  fair  allocation  of  benefits  will  help   prevent  contestation  of  revenues  and  ensure  effective  collaboration  within  the  ARD  process.  

2.4  Locating  Air  Rights  Development  Opportunities  
Another  activity  that  public  entities  can  participate  in  is  the  location  of  opportunities  for  ARD.   The  benefit  of  a  public  entity  identifying  ARD  opportunities  is  to  inform  developers  and  further   encourage  this  type  of  development.  It  can  also  help  public  entities  prepare  the  site  to  be   suitable  for  development,  taking  actions  such  as  rezoning,  land  assembly,  or  establishing  funds   or  financial  tools  for  necessary  improvements.  These  analyses  can  be  done  by  government   agencies  or  by  the  local  jurisdiction.

Siting  ARD  locations  can  be  conducted  on  a  city-wide  scale,  such  as  the  inventory  of  decking   opportunities  over  transportation  corridors  created  by  the  Department  of  City  Planning  in  New   York  (New  York,  2008).  This  inventory  is  a  comprehensive  review  that  acts  as  a  preliminary   analysis  of  potential  corridors  for  future  consideration  without  suggesting  land  use  changes.  It   was  completed  by  the  local  jurisdiction,  but  included  properties  owned  by  other  public  entities.   The  opportunities  were  categorized  under  rail/transit  open  cuts,  rail/transit  yards,  and  roadway   open  cuts.  Evaluation  criteria  were  applied  to  the  corridor  and  areas  within  a  quarter  mile.   Other  examples  are  more  corridor  or  area  specific.  Just  outside  of  Washington  D.C.  in  Arlington,   Virginia's  Office  of  Transportation  Public-Private  Partnerships  requested  information  on  air   rights  opportunities  in  Arlington  and  found  that  the  I-66  corridor  in  Rosslyn  was  the  most   promising.  Arlington  County  chose  to  conduct  their  own  review  of  ARD  opportunities  in   Rosslyn,  primarily  using  a  pro  forma  analysis  of  the  anticipated  revenues  and  costs  to  evaluate   the  economic  feasibility  and  appropriate  timing  of  development  (Arlington  County,  2015).   Other  jurisdictions  use  a  collaborative  approach.  The  WMATA  works  with  local  jurisdictions  to   locate  ARD  opportunities  over  its  infrastructure  (WMATA,  2013).     The  search  for  ARD  opportunities  can  include  various  areas  such  as  railroad  properties,   waterways,  highways,  off-street  parking  areas,  or  other  public  structures  (Lillie,  1964).  From  the   analyses  that  have  been  completed,  multiple  criteria  have  been  used  to  evaluate  ARD   opportunities.  Table  4  provides  a  summary  of  the  criteria  selected  from  the  case  studies  and   literature  review.

3.0  Regulatory  Issues  
This  section  details  how  public  entities  can  control  and  regulate  ARD.  There  are  several  tools   that  can  be  used  to  guide  an  ARD  project.  These  tools  include  legal  instruments  affecting  site   ownership,  municipal  regulatory  controls,  and  guidelines  for  planning,  design,  and  construction.   Additionally,  an  overview  of  ARD  approval  processes  is  provided.

The  creation  of  air  space  parcels  above  a  horizontal  plane  requires  the  appropriate  legal  tools.   As  previously  seen,  the  legal  basis  of  air  rights  is  found  in  the  maxim  cujus  est  solum,  ejus  est   usque  ad  coelom,  implying  the  surface  landowner  also  owns  the  air  space  above.  Air  rights  are   part  of  a  `bundle  of  rights'  that  are  tied  to  property,  which  can  be  sold  or  leased  by  the   landowner  (Lillie,  1964).  In  North  America,  the  horizontal  stratification  of  air  space  is  not  a  new   phenomenon,  where  selling  stratums  of  space  has  been  evident  since  the  mid-19th  century   (Bell,  1928).   In  order  to  create  air  space  parcels,  there  needs  to  be  supporting  legislation  from  the  province   or  state.  This  legislation  can  guide  the  creation  of  air  space  parcels  and  grant  authority  to   municipalities  or  government  agencies  to  form  air  space  parcels.  For  example,  under  Part  9  of   British  Columbia's  Land  Title  Act  (British  Columbia,  2016),  submission  requirements  to  the   registrar  to  create  a  land  title  are  outlined,  while  also  granting  the  authority  of  municipalities  to   create  air  space  parcels  over  highways.  The  Massachusetts  General  Laws  (Massachusetts,  2016)   grant  authority  to  MassDOT  to  lease  air  rights  over  land  owned  by  the  department  in   connection  with  the  Turnpike  in  Boston.  It  is  recommended  that  the  public  entity  landowner   review  the  legal  environment  with  their  attorneys  or  legal  authority  to  understand  its  own   powers  and  options  (Lillie,  1964).  Additionally,  it  is  common  to  restrict  liens  on  the  parcel  for   ARD  to  prevent  encumbrances,  as  seen  in  Minneapolis'  Centre  Village  ARD  (Minneapolis,  1983).   From  the  literature  jurisdictional  scan,  there  are  four  main  legal  arrangements  that  public   entities  have  used  for  ARD:   ·   Leasing  air  space

·   Sale  of  land  with  easement     ·   Air  space  subdivision  and  sale  of  air  space   ·   Condominium/Strata   Leasing  Air  Space   One  of  the  most  common  legal  arrangements  used  for  ARD  involves  the  public  entity  retaining   ownership  of  the  land  (terra  firma)  and  leasing  the  air  space  to  a  private  entity  while  providing   easements  for  columns  and  access.  This  is  particularly  common  for  ARD  over  highways  or   railroads  (Clancy,  1998).  Examples  include  the  Hudson  Yards  development  where  the  MTA   leases  air  rights  over  its  rail  yards,  Capital  Crossing  leasing  air  rights  over  Interstate  395  in   Washington  D.C.,  and  MassDOT  leasing  air  rights  over  the  Turnpike  in  Boston.   There  are  a  number  of  benefits  from  leasing  air  space.  The  public  entity  is  able  to  retain  control   and  ownership  of  the  property,  a  revenue  stream  is  created  through  rent,  and  the  air  space   may  appreciate  in  value  over  the  term  of  the  lease  (Clancy,  1998).  There  may  also  be   advantages  for  the  developer  and  future  tenants  in  a  lease,  including  lower  site  control  costs   and  being  able  to  use  lease  payments  as  tax  deductions  (Clancy,  1998).   Sale  of  Land  with  Easement   In  contrast  to  the  lease  arrangement,  the  public  entity  may  sell  the  piece  of  land,  transferring   fee  simple  ownership  to  the  developer,  but  retain  an  easement  for  the  uses  or  infrastructure   below.  Examples  include  the  Prudential  Center  in  Boston  (Clancy,  1998).  The  sale  of  air  rights   may  be  preferred  by  developers  because  it  provides  more  control,  and  the  land  may  appreciate   in  value  over  time.  However,  the  public  entity  loses  control  over  the  property  which  may  be   problematic  if  there  is  a  need  to  alter  or  expand  the  infrastructure  below.   Air  Space  Subdivision  and  Sale  of  Air  Space   Subdividing  the  air  space  horizontally  into  two  or  more  parcels  is  another  legal  arrangement  for   ARD.  This  involves  creating  distinct  titles  in  reference  to  a  three-dimensional  site  plan.  This   allows  for  the  public  entity  to  retain  ownership  of  the  land  (referred  to  as  the  `remnant  parcel')   while  the  developer  owns  separately  the  air  space  above  and  associated  column  supports   (referred  to  as  the  `air  space  parcel').  This  has  become  a  common  practice  in  Vancouver,

especially  for  mixed-use  developments  (Jones,  2007).  Examples  include  Central  City  in  Surrey,   British  Columbia  (Jones,  2007)  and  the  Lansdowne  Park  redevelopment  in  Ottawa  (Kirkpatrick,   2012).  This  is  an  attractive  option  because  it  provides  more  freedom  and  control  for  both   parties  without  needing  to  share  common  areas.  Issues  can  include  limited  expansion   opportunity  for  the  remnant  parcel  and  revenue  being  limited  to  a  single,  lump-sum  payment.     Condominium/Strata   ARD  ownership  can  also  be  arranged  through  a  condominium  or  strata  agreement.  An  ARD   condominium  arrangement  would  consist  of  the  public  entity  owning  the  land  and   infrastructure  below  while  the  air  space  above  can  be  divided  into  individual  units  to  be  sold.   The  difference  between  condominium  and  subdivision  is  that  the  public  entity  and  individual   owners  would  share  common  areas  in  a  condominium  agreement.  These  shared  elements   could  include  access  to  and  maintenance  of  the  platform  or  columns  (Pine,  1970).  An  issue  with   the  condominium  arrangement  is  that  the  shared  responsibility  or  common  elements  may  be  a   source  of  contention  among  owners  and  may  limit  uses  (Jones,  2007).   Since  each  locality  is  unique,  some  legal  arrangements  may  be  more  appropriate  than  others   depending  on  the  local  context.  Developers  may  not  be  accustomed  to  leasing  land  or  air  space   in  a  particular  municipality,  and  therefore  will  be  more  inclined  towards  a  sale  of  air  rights.   Furthermore,  the  options  available  to  a  public  entity  may  be  limited  within  the  provincial  or   state  legislation.  Therefore,  the  choice  of  legal  arrangement  will  be  dependent  on  the  legal   environment  and  the  local  market.  

3.2  Regulatory  Controls  
This  section  highlights  the  various  ways  that  ARD  is  regulated  and  how  it  works  with  other  tools   that  governments  use  to  regulate  development.  These  tools  are  primarily  used  by  local   governments,  but  it  is  important  for  government  agencies,  developers,  and  the  general  public   to  understand  how  ARD  is  regulated.  Below  is  an  overview  of  the  tools  that  have  been  used  to   regulate  ARD.

The  previous  sections  showed  that  ARD  above  state-  or  federally-owned  infrastructure  requires   approval  from  the  respective  governing  body.  An  example  is  the  Federal  Highway   Administration  (FHWA),  where  all  ARD  projects  above  the  interstate  highway  system  need  to   follow  established  guidelines  and  are  approved  by  the  FHWA.  Many  ARD  projects  will  also   require  environmental  assessments  to  be  submitted  to  provincial/state  or  federal  governments.   For  example,  ARD  in  Boston  may  require  review  by  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection   Agency  and  the  State  Office  of  Environmental  Affairs  for  discharge  and  other  environmental   permits  (Epsilon  Associates,  2008).  Federal  environmental  reviews  are  required  for  the   proposed  Union  Station  ARD  in  Washington  D.C.,  which  typically  take  between  3  and  7  years  for   complex  projects  (Neibauer,  2015).  Having  knowledge  of  these  regulations  and  their  respective   timelines  are  important  for  ARD  projects.   Master  Plans   ARD  can  be  incorporated  within  any  local  jurisdictional  planning  document  guiding  the  greater   area.  These  plans  can  be  corridor  specific,  such  as  the  master  plan  created  for  ARD   opportunities  over  the  Turnpike  in  Boston  (BRA,  1998).  ARD  opportunities  can  also  be   incorporated  into  city  official  plans  or  neighbourhood  plans.  In  Washington  D.C.,  the  city-wide   Comprehensive  Plan,  under  Central  Washington  Policy  2.5.6,  promotes  ARD  over  the  I-395   (Steingasser,  2010).  Chicago's  Union  Station  Master  Plan  also  has  long-term  provisions  for  air   rights  (TranSystems  Corporation,  2012).  Including  ARD  opportunities  within  master  plans  can   increase  awareness  within  the  development  community,  help  integrate  the  development  within   the  surrounding  areas,  and  encourage  more  sensitive  development.   Zoning   This  report  has  shown  the  importance  of  applying  local  regulations  to  ARD,  which  includes   zoning.  Before  Massachusetts  mandated  development  to  follow  local  regulations,  ARD  over  the   Turnpike  was  essentially  zoning-free.  This  was  initially  seen  as  a  major  benefit  as  it  was   perceived  to  provide  more  freedom  for  the  developer.  However,  as  Campbell  (2004)  shows   with  the  Columbus  Centre  ARD  in  Boston,  the  lack  of  zoning  actually  became  the  project's

biggest  disadvantage.  Without  a  clear  process  identified  and  without  providing  any  form  of   direction  for  the  site,  uncertainty  grows,  which  is  a  major  issue  for  developers  and  investors   (Schulte,  2009).  In  fact,  without  applicable  zoning,  the  developer  of  the  Columbus  Centre  ARD   had  to  contend  with  several  stakeholder  desires  much  later  in  the  development  process,   leading  to  numerous  redesigns  and  added  public  consultation  costing  over  $3  million   (Campbell,  2004).  Not  only  does  zoning  help  to  ensure  sensitive  development  in  the  local  area,   but  it  also  provides  a  clear  process  and  manages  the  expectations  of  the  stakeholders.   There  are  several  types  of  zoning  that  municipalities  can  use.  Many  municipalities  use  the   existing  zoning  in  place.  For  example,  municipalities  in  the  Lower  Mainland  do  not  have  specific   zones  for  ARD,  but  use  existing  zones  to  regulate  the  proposal  as  if  the  development  was  on   terra  firma.  Often  the  ARD  is  regulated  under  site-specific  zoning.  The  Marine  Gateway   development  and  the  ARD  near  the  Main  Street  SkyTrain  Station  are  zoned  as  Comprehensive   Development  Districts  (CD-1).  CD-1  or  other  site-specific  zones  are  tailor-made  to  the  proposed   development,  often  facilitating  more  flexibility  for  the  developer  with  a  lengthier  and  more   involved  review  process.  Additionally,  it  is  common  for  local  governments  to  treat  the  ARD  as  a   single  entity,  even  if  it  is  split  among  different  owners  and  titles.  In  New  Westminster's  Zoning   Bylaw,  the  definition  of  site  mentions  that  the  air  space  parcels  and  land  will  be  treated  as  a   single  site  (New  Westminster,  2001).  This  is  important  for  calculations  such  as  density  or  for   parking  requirements.   Other  jurisdictions  have  general  provisions  for  ARD  in  their  zoning  bylaws.  In  New  York's  Zoning   Resolution  (New  York,  2016),  provisions  are  made  for  air  space  development  over  railroad  and   transit  ROWs  involving  residential  (22-41),  commercial  (32-44),  and  industrial  (42-462)  uses.   Essentially,  these  sections  specify  that  development  above  these  ROWs  are  limited  to  accessory   uses  or  passenger  stations.  However,  special  permits  may  be  granted  over  rail  and  transit  (74- 681)  or  streets  (74-682)  for  other  types  of  development.  Conditions  for  granting  these  permits   include:   ·   adequate  street  access;     ·   density  and  distribution  of  buildings  do  not  adversely  affect  the  surrounding  area;     ·   uses  do  not  conflict  with  one  another;  and

·   development  does  not  prevent  future  use  or  improvements  to  the  ROW  below.     Additionally,  the  Commissioner  may  determine  appropriate  parking  and  loading  requirements,   along  with  suitability  of  development  with  the  surrounding  area's  character.  The  role  of  the   Commissioner  in  these  special  permits  provides  flexibility  and  facilitates  appropriate  integration   with  the  surrounding  areas.   Other  case  studies  use  overlay  districts  as  a  form  of  density  bonusing.  Boston,  Chicago,  and   Washington  D.C.  use  this  type  of  density  bonusing  overlay,  known  as  Planned  Development   Areas  (PDA),  Planned  Developments  (PD),  or  Planned  Unit  Developments  (PUD)  respectively   (Lopez  &  Hampton,  2014;  Chicago,  2015;  District  of  Columbia,  2002).  These  overlay  districts   follow  the  existing  zoning,  but  provide  flexibility  for  aspects  such  as  density,  height,  and  parking   requirements.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  separate  development  review  used  and  the  developer   provides  additional  community  benefits.   A  final  form  of  zoning  is  stand-alone  zones  that  are  catered  to  an  ARD  project.  For  example,  the   Hudson  Yards  Development  is  under  the  Special  Hudson  Yards  District  zoning  (New  York,  2005).   Boston's  Zoning  Code  contains  the  South  Station  Air  Rights  Development  Sub-Area,  which  has   specific  height  and  FAR  requirements  (Article  40.7).  In  Washington  D.C.,  the  Union  Station  ARD   is  under  the  Union  Station  North  (USN)  zoning.  Interestingly,  the  Union  Station  ARD  considered   split  zoning  where  the  ground  parcel  would  remain  industrial  so  Amtrak  could  continue  to  build   structures,  and  a  high-density  zoning  (USN)  above  for  the  ARD  (Steingasser,  2009).  These  zones   have  specific  regulations  for  ARD  and  establish  a  review  process.   There  are  several  zoning  options  for  local  governments.  A  key  consideration  with  the  zoning   tool  is  to  balance  the  need  to  ensure  appropriate  and  sensitive  development  while  providing   sufficient  flexibility  to  accommodate  this  complex  form  of  development  (Campbell,  2004).  Each   of  the  types  explored  above  have  some  element  of  flexibility  incorporated  into  the  approach.   Flexibility  can  be  justified  if  there  are  additional  community  benefits  provided  or  if  the  ARD  is   above  public  transit  infrastructure.   Subdivision

If  the  legal  arrangement  involves  a  subdivision  of  air  rights  parcels,  then  the  local  jurisdiction   will  have  a  review  and  approval  process.  Both  the  City  of  Vancouver  (Vancouver,  2016)  and  the   City  of  Richmond  (Richmond,  2015)  in  British  Columbia  have  air  space  subdivision  review   processes.  These  generally  involve  an  application  fee,  a  title  summary  report  with  a  lawyer's   opinion  on  the  subdivision  impacts,  a  3D  site  plan,  architectural  drawings,  and  a  code  report   prepared  by  a  code  consultant  or  certified  professional  on  how  the  air  space  parcel  will  comply   with  building  codes.   Covenant  Agreements   Sometimes  the  owners  involved  in  an  ARD  project  will  be  required  to  enter  into  an  agreement   with  the  municipality.  Under  British  Columbia's  Land  Title  Act,  Section  219  Covenants  allow   local  governments  and  government  agencies  to  impose  obligations  or  restrictions  on  the  land   or  development.  These  agreements  can  ensure  that  future  owners  of  air  space  parcels  are   bound  by  the  initial  agreement,  and  are  typically  done  at  the  time  of  subdivision.  For  example,   the  City  of  Vancouver  requires  owners  involved  in  an  air  space  subdivision  to  grant  a  covenant   to  the  City,  where  the  owners  release  and  indemnify  the  City  of  all  liability  from  treating  the   building  as  a  single  entity,  and  owners  agree  to  maintain  common  safety  and  maintenance   systems  and  exits  (Vancouver,  2016).  These  types  of  covenants  can  be  flexible  while  adding   another  layer  of  control  for  local  jurisdictions.   Building  Codes   From  the  literature  scan,  Lillie  (1964)  suggests  that  national  and  regional  building  standards   should  be  established  for  ARD.  The  City  of  Vancouver's  Building  By-Law  has  provisions  for  ARD   under  section  1.3.3.5:  Air  Space  Subdivision  (Vancouver,  2014).  The  building  by-law  states  that   the  Chief  Building  Official  should  treat  the  subdivision  of  parcels  as  a  single  building,  and   generally  ensures  that  owners  have  shared  access  to  fire,  life  safety,  and  other  systems.   Building  Permits   As  with  other  developments,  the  local  governments  will  require  a  series  of  building  permits.   Additional  permits  that  are  required  for  ARD  may  include  various  foundational  permits.  In

Boston,  permits  include  groundwater  and  sewer  discharge,  parking  garage,  building  and   occupancy,  and  tieback/earth  retention  (Epsilon  Associates,  2008).  From  the  jurisdictional  scan,   generally  there  are  no  special  or  unique  permits  required  for  ARD.   There  are  several  tools  that  local  jurisdictions  can  use  to  regulate  ARD.  A  summary  of  all  the   anticipated  approvals  and  permits  for  an  ARD  project  in  Boston  can  be  found  in  Appendix  C.  The   regulations  need  to  have  a  balance  of  providing  clear  direction  for  the  development  but  also   being  flexible  to  accommodate  the  unique  challenges  of  the  site.  The  amount  of  regulations  can   be  daunting  for  potential  developers,  which  is  why  it  is  important  for  the  responsible   organization  to  act  as  a  liaison  between  the  developer  and  other  government  agencies.  In   general,  local  governments  should  clarify  the  regulations  surrounding  ARD  to  increase   awareness  within  the  private  sector  and  the  general  public.  

3.3  Planning  and  Design  Guidelines  
There  are  several  planning  and  design  considerations  involved  with  ARD.  Most  of  these   considerations  are  not  unique  to  ARD;  however,  some  are  more  emphasized.  The  majority  of   planning  and  design  considerations  are  reviewed  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Guidelines  can  be   established  for  a  specific  piece  of  infrastructure  such  as  the  FHWA's  Airspace  Guidelines   (FHWA,  2010)  or  Los  Angeles  County's  guidelines  for  overbuilding  open  channels  (Los  Angeles   County,  2004).  Other  guidelines  can  be  established  for  districts  or  corridors,  such  as  the   guidelines  for  development  over  the  Turnpike  in  Boston  (BRA,  1998).  The  Turnpike  air  rights   guidelines  separate  the  corridor  into  districts  and  provide  recommendations  in  four  main  areas:   ·   Uses  (upper  floors,  street  level)   ·   Transportation  (pedestrian  circulation,  parking,  traffic  management,  public   transportation,  vehicular  access  and  circulation,  bicycle)   ·   Public  Realm  (public  open  spaces,  connections,  and  sidewalks,  view  corridors)   ·   Form  (building  locations,  scale  and  massing,  height,  design  character)   Overall,  there  are  two  emphasized  design  considerations  for  ARD:  integration  with  surrounding   areas  and  the  design  of  the  platform.   ARD  project  proponents  need  to  consider  their  surrounding  areas  and  should  be  developed  as   part  of  a  cohesive  unit.  It  is  important  to  apply  design  considerations  to  abutting  lands  to

facilitate  a  smooth  transition  and  direct  how  the  ARD  can  enhance  its  surroundings  (Campbell,   2004).  Public  ownership  of  land  around  an  ARD  site  can  help  ensure  that  the  ARD  and   surrounding  areas  are  developed  holistically  (Campbell,  2004).   One  of  the  main  considerations  to  ARD  integration  is  the  character  of  the  surrounding  area.   This  includes  appropriate  height,  massing,  and  density,  and  an  appropriate  transition  of  building   heights.  The  Turnpike  air  rights  guidelines  note  that  the  ARD  uses  influence  the  massing  of  the   buildings,  with  smaller  and  skinnier  towers  for  residential  and  large  floor  plates  for  office  uses   (BRA,  1998).  Design  considerations  also  include  complimentary  building  materials  and   architectural  styles  (Campbell,  2004).  The  Prudential  Center  in  Boston  is  an  example  of  an   inappropriate  development,  as  the  52-storey  glass  tower  is  adjacent  to  Victorian  low-rise   structures  (Campbell,  2004).  Instead,  ARD  structures  should  reflect  the  neighbourhood's  style   and  density.  The  ARD  structures  themselves  also  have  an  opportunity  to  be  landmark  buildings   if  they  are  in  high  visibility  areas  (Lillie,  1964).  These  landmark  structures  can  further  build  upon   the  identity  of  the  neighbourhood.   Another  consideration  is  connectivity  of  the  ARD.  This  includes  complimenting  and  connecting   the  local  street  network,  providing  a  comfortable  pedestrian  realm,  and  integrating  with   transportation  infrastructure.  The  ARD  should  not  impede  the  flow  of  traffic  below.   Additionally,  the  ARD  should  provide  direct  connections  to  public  transit  if  it  is  located  above   such  infrastructure.  The  project  should  also  consider  the  long-term  needs  of  the  transportation   system  and  identify  any  improvements  or  future  expansion  needs  (Goldschmidt,  1964).  In   regards  to  the  public  realm,  ARD  proponents  should  consider  multi-modal  transportation   connections,  community  amenities,  parks  and  open  spaces,  and  view  corridors.  These   amenities  may  also  lead  to  the  community  accepting  higher  densities  and  foster  community   support  for  the  project  (Campbell,  2004).  Finally,  connections  need  to  be  considered  for   utilities,  and  a  servicing  plan  for  the  area  is  recommended.  Lillie  (1964)  recalls  an  ARD  project  in   Chicago  that  was  prevented  because  it  did  not  have  the  required  utilities.   Consideration  should  also  be  given  to  the  lifespan  of  the  uses  involved  in  an  ARD  project.   Goldschmidt  (1964)  notes  that  the  different  uses  involved  in  ARD  may  have  differing  rates  of

obsolescence,  where  some  uses  will  have  an  end  date  before  others.  Therefore,  flexibility  in  the   design  of  the  ARD  structures  is  encouraged  to  accommodate  different  uses  or  the  expansion  of   current  uses.   Finally,  the  design  of  the  platform  is  an  important  consideration.  The  platform  is  one  of  the   most  significant  investments  within  an  ARD  project  and  provides  some  of  the  greatest   challenges.  Design  considerations  of  the  infrastructure  below  can  help  ease  some  of  these   complexities.  These  include  providing  wide  medians  within  the  transportation  route  and  land   on  either  side  for  structural  supports  (Campbell,  2004).  Without  this  adjacent  land  for   foundations,  the  developer  needs  to  build  slurry  walls  and  cantilever  systems  at  the  edge  of  the   corridor  which  greatly  increases  the  costs  (Campbell,  2004).  Additionally,  depressing  the   transportation  route  can  help  ease  the  transition  between  the  adjacent  land  and  future   platform  (Hauser,  1989).   There  are  a  number  of  safety  considerations  when  designing  a  platform,  including  lighting,   ventilation,  and  preventing  objects  falling  onto  the  corridor  below  (Hauser,  1989).  The  design  of   the  deck  will  be  influenced  by  the  transportation  corridor  (Williams  &  McNichol,  1973).  For   example,  rail  electrification  leads  to  lower  ventilation  requirements.  Additionally,  the  lack  of  a   basement  is  an  issue  for  underground  parking,  utilities  and  services,  and  mechanical  equipment   such  as  elevator  pits  (Campbell  2004;  Hauser,  1989).  The  Union  Station  ARD  zoning  addresses   these  issues  by  allowing  mechanical  equipment  and  parking  areas  to  be  located  in  the  platform   itself  (Steingasser,  2009).  Other  solutions  require  the  mechanical  equipment  and  parking  to  be   located  elsewhere.   Finally,  the  design  of  the  platform  must  address  environmental  issues  such  as  noise,  vibration,   fumes,  drainage,  and  heat.  The  Hudson  Yards  platform  provides  an  innovative  design  to  address   many  of  these  issues.

   Figure  1:  Cross-section  of  Hudson  Yards  Platform  (Dunlap,  2015)   As  seen  in  Figure  1,  the  platform  consists  of  a  series  of  layers.  Clearance  above  transportation   infrastructure  can  range  between  16  and  24  feet.  The  first  layer  of  the  Hudson  Yards  platform   above  the  rail  yard  is  a  six-foot  high  empty  area  known  as  the  plenum  that  contains  15  powerful   fans  that  ventilate  and  cool  the  rail  yard  (Dunlap,  2015).  Above  the  plenum  is  a  rainwater   storage  tank  that  irrigates  the  trees  and  plants  above.  The  next  layer  is  a  concrete  cooling  slab   that  carries  glycol  coolant,  similar  to  that  of  an  ice-skating  rink.  This  helps  protect  the  above   trees  and  platform  from  the  heat  generated  below.  The  trees  and  plants  are  then  planted  in  a   sand-based  structural  soil  and  supplemented  with  compost  and  nutrients.

The  platform  in  the  Capitol  Crossing  ARD  in  Washington  D.C.  also  features  an  innovative  design.   To  address  fumes  from  the  highway  below,  vehicle  exhaust  is  directed  towards  vents  where  the   installed  Eco-Chimneys,  made  of  large  plants,  treat  the  vehicle  exhaust  and  release  clean  air   into  the  community  (Capitol  Crossing,  n.d.).  Additionally,  water  cisterns  capture  and  treat  90%   of  storm  water  runoff,  reducing  landscaping  water  by  50%  and  potable  water  use  by  40%   (Capitol  Crossing,  n.d.).     Other  design  considerations  can  address  environmental  issues.  For  instance,  a  reinforced  floor   on  the  first  level  can  help  mitigate  noise,  vibrations,  and  fumes  (Hauser,  1989).  Overall,  the   design  interventions  will  depend  on  the  local  context  and  financial  feasibility.  

3.4  Construction  Guidelines  
Building  an  ARD  project  has  its  challenges,  including  both  the  physical  construction  and  the   required  coordination  between  the  developer  and  public  entities.  Daily  coordination  between   the  developer's  engineering  team  and  public  engineers  is  essential  to  the  success  of  an  ARD   project  (Hauser,  1989).  Having  clear  construction  guidelines  will  foster  an  effective  working   relationship  between  engineering  teams,  and  keep  everyone  on  the  same  page  throughout  the   construction  process.  Construction  guidelines  have  two  general  considerations:  protecting  the   infrastructure  and  the  managing  the  construction  phase.   An  example  of  construction  guidelines  protecting  infrastructure  is  found  in  Vancouver.   TransLink  has  established  the  Adjacent  and  Integrated  Development  process  that  reviews   development  around  its  SkyTrain  infrastructure  (TransLink,  n.d.b).  A  developer's  guide  has  been   prepared  for  each  of  its  SkyTrain  lines,  and  the  types  of  precautions  taken  are  dependent  on   how  close  the  development  is  to  the  infrastructure,  known  as  the  limits  of  approach.  The   guidelines  cover  construction  aspects  such  as  signage,  safety  personnel  requirements,   communication  protocols,  contact  information,  and  construction  hours.  TransLink  and  the   developer  together  create  a  monitoring  program  that  is  used  to  regulate  construction  activity.   An  example  of  guidelines  that  manage  the  construction  phase  can  be  found  in  Boston.  ARD   proponents  building  over  the  Turnpike  are  required  to  submit  a  Construction  Management  Plan

(CMP)  to  the  Boston  Transportation  Department.  A  CMP  helps  coordinate  construction   schedules  and  zones  with  other  construction  projects.  It  also  regulates  truck  routing,  protection   of  existing  utilities,  control  of  noise  and  dust,  and  construction  parking  or  drop-off  areas.  For   example,  the  Fenway  Park  CMP  (Epsilon  Associates,  2008)  detailed  that  there  won't  be  any   construction  parking  in  order  to  reduce  vehicle  trips;  instead  construction  workers  were   encouraged  to  use  public  transportation.  Overall,  there  is  limited  room  provided  for  the   construction  phase,  requiring  engineers  to  create  phased  strategies  within  the  work  plan   (Hauser,  1989).  For  ARD  involving  transportation  routes,  construction  activities  and  storage   cannot  interfere  with  traffic.  Therefore,  construction  may  need  to  be  done  during  off-peak   hours  such  as  nights  or  weekends,  which  may  increase  construction  costs  (Clancy,  1998).   There  are  many  complexities  associated  with  constructing  an  ARD  project,  which  typically   extends  the  construction  period  by  an  additional  year  (Campbell,  2004).  However,  establishing   clear  and  identifiable  construction  guidelines  and  upfront  agreements  will  increase  safety,  and   help  organize  construction  activity  to  foster  an  effective  construction  phase.  

3.5  Approval  Process  
This  section  will  provide  an  overview  of  the  steps  taken  to  approve  an  ARD  project.  Many  of  the   case  studies  utilized  review  processes  that  were  already  established.  For  instance,  the   municipalities  in  the  Lower  Mainland  did  not  have  specific  review  procedures  for  ARD.  The   Union  Station  North  zoning  review  in  Washington  D.C.  is  similar  to  its  Planned  Unit   Development  process.  Additionally,  Boston's  review  of  ARD  over  the  Turnpike  is  modeled  after   the  Article  80  zoning  review  process.  What  is  unique  in  the  review  process  of  ARD  is  the  private   development  of  a  public  asset  and  how  the  public  good  is  solicited  to  the  private  market.     The  ownership  of  land  will  determine  the  approach  taken  in  the  approval  process.  If  the  public   entity  owns  the  land  and  therefore  the  air  space  above,  then  a  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP)  or   Request  for  Quote  (RFQ)  process  is  used  to  select  the  developer  and  proposal  for  the  site.  The   RFP  competitive  process  is  argued  to  be  effective  because  it  encourages  innovative  design,  and   the  developer  must  show  its  competency  to  handle  the  complexities  of  ARD  (Campbell,  2004).   Examples  of  these  ARD  approval  processes  include  Boston's  Civic  Vision  for  Turnpike  Air  Rights

Once  the  developer  has  been  selected,  local  jurisdictional  approval  would  initiate  after  the   RFP/RFQ  process.   Both  of  these  approval  processes  have  an  aspect  of  collaboration  between  the  government   agency  and  the  municipality.  They  also  incorporate  public  feedback  throughout  the  process.   Furthermore,  the  WMATA  guidelines  have  multiple  processes  for  various  circumstances,   including  a  process  for  unsolicited  proposals.  Overall,  ARD  approval  processes  share  common   themes.  Savvides  (2002)  helps  summarize  these  approval  processes  into  four  general  steps:   1.   Study  corridor  to  determine  areas  of  potential  development.   2.   Determine  uses  of  the  site  informed  by  the  issues  of  the  use  below.   3.   Identify  local  planning,  zoning,  and  community  needs.   4.   Finalize  valuation  of  air  rights  and  the  development  agreement.   The  approval  process  is  different  if  the  government  agency  does  not  own  the  land.  For  example,   Vancouver's  TransLink  has  ROWs  for  some  of  its  infrastructure,  and  therefore  cannot  sell   density  above  it.  TransLink's  approval  process  is  focused  more  on  protecting  its  infrastructure   by  reviewing  the  proposal's  design  and  construction  phase.  The  approval  process  also  includes   recovering  the  cost  for  TransLink  to  review  the  proposal  and  to  operate  its  infrastructure  with   the  ARD.  TransLink's  process  is  as  follows:   1.   Project  Overview  and  Scope  Presentation:  developer  outlines  project  goals,  plans,  and   objectives.   2.   Funding  Letter:  developer  agrees  to  reimburse  TransLink  for  costs  associated  with  the   review.   3.   Letter  of  Credit:  developer  provides  Letter  of  Credit  as  interim  security  for  review  work   costs.  Amount  is  determined  by  TransLink.   4.   Schematic  Design:  developer  prepares  and  revises  site  plan,  illustrations,  renderings,   and  functional  plans.  This  also  coincides  with  the  development  permit  phase  of  the   municipality.   5.   TransLink  Preliminary  Acceptance.   6.   Detailed  Design:  developer  prepares  and  revises  construction  drawings,  specifications,   phasing  plans,  and  other  permits  as  required.  This  also  coincides  with  the  building   permit  phase  of  the  municipality.

7.   Define  Monitoring  Program:  TransLink  and  the  developer  agree  to  a  mitigation  and   monitoring  program  for  construction  activities.   8.   TransLink  Final  Acceptance.   9.   Adjacent  and  Integrated  Development  Agreement:  details  TransLink's  requirements  for   the  full  scope  of  work.   10.  Construction  and  Monitoring:  TransLink  and  the  developer  conduct  ongoing  project   monitoring.   This  process  identifies  points  that  coincide  with  the  municipal  reviews  (i.e  development  and   building  permit  phases).  As  mentioned  previously,  the  municipal  review  process  typically  does   not  differ  between  ARD  and  other  types  of  development.  ARD  goes  through  various   department  review  stages  and  ultimately  to  council  or  the  governing  body.   One  of  the  greatest  sources  of  risk  for  a  developer  revolves  around  the  regulatory  approval  of   the  project  (Chu,  1985).  Providing  transparency  around  the  approval  process  provides  more   predictability  and  reduces  risk,  thereby  increasing  the  likelihood  of  ARD  implementation.

4.0  Facilitation  Issues  
In  addition  to  coordinating  with  other  public  entities,  government  agencies  and  municipalities   need  to  effectively  communicate  with  other  stakeholders  involved  in  the  ARD  process,   particularly  the  developer  and  the  general  public.  This  section  looks  at  the  facilitation  issues   between  these  two  important  stakeholders  and  how  public  entities  can  foster  efficient   engagement.     A  key  tension  between  the  general  public  and  developers  revolves  around  the  needed  density   to  make  ARD  economically  feasible.  The  needed  density  may  be  at  odds  with  the  desires  of  the   surrounding  community.  The  analysis  of  the  case  studies  provides  examples  of  how  public   entities  can  address  this  tension.  

4.1  Public  Engagement  
Local  residents  are  a  key  stakeholder  within  the  ARD  process.  The  surrounding  community  plays   a  crucial  role  in  whether  an  ARD  project  receives  approval.  ARD  projects  tend  to  be   controversial  as  development  is  usually  within  a  central  and  highly  populated  area,  and  it   includes  solicitation  of  a  public  good  to  the  private  market.  As  mentioned  previously,  the   common  tension  involves  the  density  of  ARD,  including  the  height,  scale,  and  massing.  Savvides   (2002)  provides  additional  community  concerns,  including  neighbourhood  gentrification,   vehicle  traffic,  pedestrian  circulation,  site  amenities  and  improvements,  provision  of  jobs,  and   environmental  concerns  such  as  noise,  wind,  and  air  quality.   While  both  the  government  agency,  municipality,  and  developer  should  engage  with  the   general  public,  the  municipality  is  typically  responsible  for  the  public  engagement  component   of  an  ARD  project.  This  is  reasonable  since  the  municipality  has  more  experience  in  public   consultation  and  will  have  staff  that  are  more  aware  of  local  stakeholders.  The  WMATA  Joint   Development  Guidelines  request  that  the  municipality  present  a  list  of  community   organizations  to  involve  in  the  consultation  (WMATA,  2013).  Additionally,  the  WMATA  may   enter  into  an  MOU  with  the  local  jurisdiction  on  outreach  procedures.  From  the  case  studies,   there  are  three  considerations  regarding  the  public  engagement  component  of  ARD:  the

organization  of  community  representatives,  the  level  of  involvement  of  the  general  public   within  the  RFP  process,  and  effective  engagement  with  the  community.   Beginning  with  the  organization  of  community  representatives,  municipalities  typically  use   established  community  engagement  procedures.  Some  municipalities  do  not  create  a  body  that   represents  the  community's  interest  but  leave  it  open  to  the  public.  Others  use  community   commissions  or  committees  to  conduct  the  community  review  of  ARD  proposals.  Some   committees  are  geographically-based.  For  example,  in  Minneapolis,  the  affected   neighbourhood  association  is  included  in  the  public  consultation  of  the  ARD  project.   Additionally,  Washington  D.C.  uses  geographically-based  Advisory  Neighbourhood  Commissions   (ANC)  to  conduct  the  community  review  of  ARD  proposals.  ANCs  are  locally  elected  community   representatives  within  a  jurisdiction  that  make  up  an  advisory  board,  and  are  given  party  status   for  the  application.  The  WMATA  Joint  Development  Guidelines  specify  the  role  of  the   community,  and  specifically  ask  for  feedback  on  community  amenity  needs,  bike  and  pedestrian   circulation,  land  use  needs,  and  building  height  and  density  concerns  (WMATA,  2013).  Other   committees  are  created  on  a  project-specific  basis.  For  example,  Boston  establishes  Community   Advisory  Committees  (CAC)  to  act  as  a  voice  for  the  community  and  as  a  liaison  between  the   community  and  decision-makers.  These  ad  hoc  committees  consist  of  neighbours,  stakeholders,   and  government  representatives.  CACs  review  ARD  proposals  and  create  project  goals  in  the   initial  stages.  They  also  provide  recommendations  on  physical  design,  land  use,  jobs,  pedestrian   circulation,  traffic,  housing,  wind  and  shadows,  and  economic  impact  (BRA,  1998).     In  regards  to  when  the  public  is  involved  in  the  RFP/RFQ  process,  typically  the  community  is   consulted  in  the  initial  and  final  review  stages.  Some  public  entities  choose  to  consult  the  public   before  the  RFP  is  issued.  In  the  Hudson  Yards  ARD,  the  MTA  and  HYDC  held  workshops  and   consultations  with  City  and  State  departments  and  community  organizations  (MTA,  n.d.).  The   WMATA  guidelines  also  state  that  the  WMATA  staff  may  need  to  meet  with  potentially  affected   communities  before  solicitation  of  an  ARD  opportunity  (WMATA,  2013).  Other  cities  like  Boston   choose  to  form  a  CAC  after  an  RFQ  is  released  (BRA,  1998),  however  the  public  is  still  involved   early  on  in  the  process.  The  public  can  then  be  involved  in  reviewing  the  submitted  developer   proposals.  The  Hudson  Yards  RFP  included  a  public  exhibition  of  the  submitted  proposals  and

the  MTA  collected  comments  (MTA,  n.d.).  The  WMATA  approval  process  contains  a  community   forum  before  a  developer  is  chosen.  Additionally,  Boston's  Turnpike  Air  Rights  Guidelines  have   the  CAC  and  the  general  public  review  the  short-listed  development  proposals  before  the   developer  is  chosen.  Finally,  the  public  may  also  be  consulted  after  the  developer  and  proposal   has  been  selected  for  a  final  review,  as  seen  in  the  WMATA  approval  process  (WMATA,  2013).   Afterwards,  the  local  jurisdictional  approval  process  would  initiate  the  public  consultation  of   the  ARD  project.   Lastly,  it  is  important  to  effectively  engage  with  the  community  for  ARD.  This  includes  careful   consideration  of  the  messaging  within  community  consultations.  The  literature  and   jurisdictional  scan  revealed  two  important  engagement  considerations.  The  first  consideration   is  educating  the  public  on  ARD  issues  (Savvides,  2002).  It  is  important  to  communicate  that  the   high  costs  of  constructing  a  platform  necessitate  greater  densities  and  that  there  must  be  this   trade-off  in  order  for  ARD  to  occur  (Campbell,  2004).  Additionally,  it  is  important  to   communicate  the  public  benefits  and  future  amenities  that  result  from  ARD.  The  benefits  can   be  communicated  through  public  consultations  or  press  materials  of  the  development,  as  seen   with  Washington  D.C.'s  Capitol  Crossing  (Capitol  Crossing,  n.d.)  or  New  York's  Hudson  Yards   (Hudson  Yards,  2016).  Public  benefits  can  also  be  specified  in  the  development  agreement,   which  will  be  detailed  in  Section  4.2.  Furthermore,  some  jurisdictions  choose  to  include  the   public  benefits  within  the  ARD  zoning.  Both  the  Capitol  Crossing  and  Hudson  Yards  zonings   specify  the  required  public  amenities,  such  as  open  space  and  affordable  housing.  This  helps  to   clearly  communicate  the  benefits  of  ARD  to  the  public  while  also  securing  these  benefits.   Overall,  communicating  the  benefits  of  ARD  can  help  the  community  to  accept  higher  densities   (Campbell,  2004).  With  effective  communication  about  the  issues  and  benefits  of  ARD,  public   support  is  likely  to  increase,  leading  to  a  smoother  approval  process.  

4.2  Development  Agreements    
Public  entities  also  need  to  have  effective  communication  with  developers.  Earlier  in  the  report,   it  was  mentioned  that  the  landowner  of  the  ARD  site  is  responsible  for  negotiating  the   development  agreement.  However,  the  landowner  must  also  work  with  other  public  entities

when  preparing  the  development  agreement.  Development  agreements  can  cover  a  wide  range   of  considerations,  such  as  the  sale  or  lease  transaction,  cost  sharing,  improvements,  the   approval  process,  and  construction  guidelines.  These  development  agreements  have  different   names,  such  as  an  Air  Space  Parcel  agreement  in  Vancouver,  or  a  Project  Development   Agreement  in  Boston.  These  ARD  agreements  often  address  site-specific  issues  and  need  to  be   prepared  on  a  case-by-case  basis  (Clancy,  1998).  Overall,  there  are  three  areas  of  consideration   for  effective  engagement  with  developers:  the  solicitation  process,  the  financial  transaction,   and  the  assignment  of  responsibilities.       The  initial  contact  with  developers  is  often  the  RFP  solicitation  process.  Some  jurisdictions,  such   as  Virginia,  Atlanta,  and  Ottawa,  release  a  Request  for  Expressions  of  Interest  (REOI)  to  gauge   the  level  of  interest  from  the  private  market.  It  is  also  used  to  educate  the  public  entity  on   developer  concerns  about  potential  ARD  projects,  and  to  ultimately  craft  a  future  RFP.  For   example,  the  Virginia  REOI  for  ARD  opportunities  in  Rosslyn  sought  information  about  the  size   of  platform  required,  the  necessary  studies,  the  preferred  transaction  structure,  viability  of   development,  and  feasibility  (Arlington  County,  2015).  The  RFP  can  feature  a  number  of   aspects,  including  the  objectives,  background  information  on  the  site,  development  and  lease   agreements,  required  improvements  (i.e.  public  open  space,  transportation  infrastructure   improvements,  percentage  of  affordable  housing),  submission  requirements  (i.e.  site  plan,  bid,   construction  plan),  and  details  of  the  selection  process.  It  can  be  helpful  to  establish  guidelines   or  criteria  for  ARD  that  developers  can  reference,  such  as  WMATA's  Joint  Development   Guidelines  (WMATA,  2013),  MARTA's  TOD  Guidelines  (MARTA,  2010),  TransLink's  Adjacent  and   Integrated  Development  Guidelines  (TransLink,  2013),  or  Boston's  Civic  Vision  for  Turnpike  Air   Rights  Guidelines  (BRA,  1998).  The  more  information  that  is  included  in  an  RFP,  the  more   predictable  the  ARD  implementation  process  and  future  development  agreement  become,   which  enables  the  developer  to  make  informed  decisions  on  its  proposal.   The  next  consideration  is  the  financial  transaction.  Firstly,  the  public  entity  needs  to  determine   whether  the  air  rights  are  sold  or  leased.  Section  3.1  explained  that  developers  may  consider  a   sale  more  desirable  and  the  public  entity  may  wish  to  lease  air  rights  to  retain  control  over  the   site.  After  the  transaction  structure  has  been  decided,  the  public  entity  and  developer  must

determine  the  valuation  of  the  air  rights,  which  is  further  detailed  in  Section  5.2.  Ultimately,   this  valuation  is  determined  by  a  third-party  appraiser  or  is  decided  through  a  competitive   bidding  process.  A  competitive  bidding  process  typically  requires  the  developer  to  submit  a  pro   forma  analysis  to  the  public  entity  with  the  agreement  that  the  financial  information  is  kept   confidential  (WMATA,  2013).  This  pro  forma  analysis  can  also  help  justify  the  density  needed  to   offset  the  costs  of  ARD  (Campbell,  2004).     The  majority  of  ARD  transactions  in  the  case  studies  involved  leasing  air  rights  to  a  developer.   These  ARD  leases  require  additional  considerations.  Firstly,  the  length  of  the  term  will  need  to   be  established.  ARD  leases  are  typically  long  term.  For  example,  Massachusetts  legislation   allows  leases  up  to  99  years.  The  payment  installments  must  also  be  established.  Payments  are   typically  monthly,  although  some  lease  agreements  may  choose  a  lump-sum  payment  upfront.   The  developer  of  the  One  Financial  Centre  in  Boston  paid  the  lease  upfront  to  avoid   complications  and  rent  increases  (Clancy,  1998).  Additionally,  public  entities  may  require  a   lump-sum  payment  to  avoid  the  boom-and-bust  cycles  of  the  real  estate  market  (Lari  et  al.,   2009).  Lease  payments  can  also  be  skewed  to  support  the  development  early  on,  where  initial   payments  are  lower  and  then  escalate  as  the  project  generates  higher  revenues  (Chu,  1985).   Additionally,  these  lease  payments  should  be  inflation-adjusted  (Mathur  &  Smith,  2012).  The   lease  agreement  may  also  specify  renewal  options  where  parties  can  renegotiate  the  value  of   the  air  rights.     The  subordination  of  debt  should  also  be  clearly  established  to  reduce  financial  risk  (Campbell,   2004).  Within  any  rental  agreement,  there  is  the  landlord  (i.e.  public  entity),  tenant  (i.e.   developer),  and  the  financial  institution  providing  the  mortgage  (Clancy,  1998).  If  the  tenant   defaults  on  its  lease  payments,  the  landlord  must  notify  the  financial  institution,  which  may   cure  the  default  and  assign  the  space  to  a  new  party.  Finally,  end-of-lease  terms  need  to  be   established,  specifically  what  happens  to  the  air  rights  and  associated  improvements.  For   example,  the  lease  for  the  Gateway  Center  in  Boston  had  provisions  stipulating  that  the  land,   air  rights,  and  any  improvements  be  reverted  back  to  the  Turnpike  Authority.

The  development  agreement  must  also  specify  the  responsibilities  of  the  parties  involved.  The   responsibilities  should  be  made  clear,  and  can  be  distributed  amongst  the  government  agency,   developer,  and  municipality.  First,  the  public  entity  should  protect  the  infrastructure  and  uses   below  the  ARD.  This  can  be  achieved  by  requiring  the  developer  to  have  enough  insurance  to   cover  the  demolition  of  all  buildings  or  improvements  that  affect  the  uses  below.  For  example,   the  Copley  Place  ARD  agreement  with  the  Turnpike  Authority  in  Boston  stipulated  in  the  lease   that  the  developer  must  have  enough  insurance  to  cover  the  cost  of  demolishing  the  entire   structure,  and  that  the  Turnpike  Authority  is  able  to  eradicate  any  encumbrances  to  the   corridor  without  the  developer's  approval  (Clancy,  1998).   Second,  the  cost-sharing  and  responsibility  for  improvements  need  to  be  established.  There  can   be  many  creative  agreements  within  ARD.  Public  amenities  are  usually  financed  by  the  public   entity.  In  the  Hudson  Yards  redevelopment,  the  zoning  specified  open  space  requirements,   which  was  financed  by  the  HYIC.  The  HYIC  was  also  responsible  for  the  Line  7  subway  extension.   Public  entities  can  also  finance  ARD  construction  costs  by  issuing  bonds,  which  can  help  make   ARD  more  financially  feasible  (Goldschmidt,  1964;  Hauser,  1989).  This  can  include  financing  the   platform,  where  ARD  revenues  are  used  to  pay  the  bonds.  This  was  initially  the  plan  in  the   Hudson  Yards  redevelopment,  where  the  HYIC  was  going  to  finance  the  platform  (HYIC,  2004);   ultimately,  however,  this  did  not  occur.  Often  when  the  public  entity  provides  financing  for  the   ARD  construction,  it  receives  development  revenue  streams  in  exchange.  For  example,  the  City   of  Minneapolis  issued  bonds  for  the  construction  of  a  new  football  stadium  in  exchange  for  the   development  rights  over  one  of  the  parking  ramps  (Minneapolis,  2014).  Additionally,  since  New   York  provided  financing  for  the  Line  7  subway  extension,  it  received  transferable  development   rights  to  sell  to  nearby  properties  (HYDC,  n.d.).     Other  development  agreements  feature  the  developer  financing  public  amenities.  For  example,   the  Capitol  Crossing  ARD  incorporates  improvements  to  the  I-395  Freeway  and  ramps  (District   of  Columbia,  2011).  Additionally,  the  Green  Line  extension  in  Medford,  Massachusetts  features   a  public-private  partnership  where  the  MBTA  provides  air  rights  over  its  land  to  Tufts   University,  while  Tufts  University  provides  security  and  maintenance  of  the  new  College  Avenue   station  and  land  for  MBTA's  new  station  at  no  cost  (Thurler,  2015).

Third,  the  development  agreement  should  assign  responsibility  for  maintenance  and  operations   (Campbell,  2004;  Clancy,  1998).  In  Vancouver,  Air  Space  Parcel  (ASP)  agreements  specify   maintenance  obligations,  rights  of  access,  cost-sharing  between  parties,  insurance,  repairing  of   damage,  and  a  dispute  resolution  clause  (Baker,  2015).  There  are  also  provisions  to  indemnify   the  local  jurisdiction  that  regulates  ARD.  The  Section  219  Covenant  in  Vancouver  can  include   indemnification  of  the  municipality  from  treating  the  building  as  a  single  entity.  Additionally,   other  agreements  require  the  developer  to  waive  claim  against  the  public  entity  on  account  of   noise,  vibration,  fumes,  odor,  or  other  causes  (Clancy,  1998).  These  provisions  help  to  reduce   the  public  entity's  financial  risks.   A  final  consideration  when  creating  a  development  agreement  is  the  timing  within  the  real   estate  cycle.  ARD  should  be  pursued  when  land  values  exceed  the  additional  construction  costs   of  developing  air  space  (Goldschmidt,  1964).  Boston  learned  this  lesson  through  the  Copley   Place  ARD  project,  where  land  values  at  the  time  were  not  sufficient  to  justify  ARD.  The  project   went  ahead  anyway,  resulting  in  the  developer  receiving  $19.7  million  in  public  funds  to  offset   the  ARD  costs  (Clancy,  1998).  Boston's  Turnpike  Air  Rights  Guidelines  now  specify  that  ARD   should  only  be  pursued  under  favourable  market  conditions  (BRA,  1998).   The  development  agreement  is  unique  to  each  jurisdiction  and  to  each  ARD  project.  Including   information  on  what  the  development  agreement  entails  in  the  early  stages  of  the  ARD  process   helps  developers  to  understand  the  public  entity's  expectations  and  to  make  informed   decisions.  Additionally,  development  agreements  require  flexibility  and  creativity  to  address   specific  issues,  but  measures  should  be  taken  to  protect  the  public  entity  from  financial  risks  or   damages  to  the  uses  below.

5.0  Economic  Valuation  Issues  
A  central  issue  within  ARD  concerns  the  economics  of  such  projects.  A  significant  challenge  is   the  exorbitant  cost  of  developing  above  another  land  use,  while  one  of  the  significant  benefits   is  the  potential  revenue  gained.  This  last  section  examines  how  public  entities  can  address  both   the  costs  and  revenues  of  ARD  to  find  the  right  balance.  The  economic  factors  analyzed  include   an  overview  of  cost-saving  measures  that  public  entities  can  employ,  the  valuation  of  air  space,   property  tax  assessment,  and  incentives  public  entities  can  utilize  to  encourage  ARD.  

5.1  Overview  of  Cost-Saving  Measures  
The  significant  costs  of  developing  air  space  have  been  noted  as  one  of  the  greatest   disincentives  for  developers.  However,  there  are  several  ways  that  public  entities  can  reduce   the  costs  of  ARD  in  order  to  make  these  projects  more  economically  feasible,  and  therefore   more  attractive  to  the  private  market.  These  cost-saving  measures  include:   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   Designing  infrastructure  to  accommodate  ARD   Design  of  the  platform   Considering  ARD  opportunities  for  new  development   Treating  the  platform  as  a  piece  of  public  infrastructure   Public  financing  of  ARD  construction   Incentives  

Designing  Infrastructure  to  Accommodate  Future  ARD   Public  entities  should  have  a  long-range  planning  focus  when  it  comes  to  infrastructure   investments.  This  includes  considering  opportunities  for  ARD,  particularly  opportunities  for   building  a  platform  above  another  land  use  or  transportation  corridor  (Pine,  1970).  There  are   two  general  ways  to  design  infrastructure  that  will  reduce  the  costs  of  building  a  platform.  First,   depressing  the  transportation  corridor  will  facilitate  an  easier  transition  between  adjoining   lands  and  the  future  platform  (Hauser,  1989).  In  Boston's  Big  Dig  project,  depressing  the   highway  allowed  adjacent  roads  to  extend  along  the  platforms  at-grade,  thereby  creating  a   smoother  transition  without  needing  to  raise  the  platform.  Second,  land  can  be  set  aside  for   structural  supports  (Campbell,  2004).  Providing  wide  medians  within  the  corridor,  providing   land  on  either  side  of  the  corridor,  and  setting  aside  non-vehicular  ROWs  allow  for  optimal

location  of  structural  supports.  Having  structural  supports  in  the  right  locations  allows  for  less   expensive  construction  techniques  and  can  support  higher  weight  loads  and  densities.   Integrating  ARD  Opportunities  with  New  Development   When  constructing  a  new  development,  it  can  be  economically  efficient  to  construct  the  land   surface  structure  and  the  air  space  structure  together.  For  example,  the  Metropolitan   Washington  Airport  Authority  (MWAA)  explored  ARD  opportunities  over  new  Silver  Line  Metro   stations  along  Dulles  Toll  Road.  It  estimated  that  if  the  ARD  structures  were  incorporated  into   the  initial  design  and  build  contract,  the  foundation  and  column  support  costs  would  be  $34   million  (MWAA,  2011).  If  the  foundations  were  built  after  the  Metrorail  became  operational,   however,  the  foundation  and  column  supports  would  need  to  be  outside  the  Metrorail  ROW,   costing  $60  million  (MWAA,  2011).    By  including  the  ARD  opportunities  in  the  construction  of   the  new  rail  infrastructure,  the  foundational  and  column  support  costs  were  nearly  halved.  The   same  forward-thinking  strategy  can  be  applied  to  new  public  buildings.  New  public  investments   should  consider  ARD  opportunities  in  the  early  stages  to  maximize  benefits  and  reduce  costs.   Design  of  the  Platform   Typically,  the  most  expensive  component  to  ARD  is  the  platform.  Brookfield's  Manhattan  West   ARD  project,  just  east  of  Hudson  Yards,  features  an  innovative  construction  technique  that   reduces  platform  costs.  Brookfield  is  using  post-tension,  precast  segmental  bridge  technology   to  build  the  deck  over  a  rail  corridor  (Manhattan  West,  2016).  Essentially,  concrete  segments   are  created  off-site  and  then  placed  by  a  launcher  and  fused  together  through  steel  cables  to   create  a  portion  of  the  bridge  span  (see  Figure  2).  The  launcher  continues  to  move  across  the   rail  corridor  to  incrementally  build  the  other  portions  for  the  platform  (see  Figure  3).  This   construction  technology  limits  the  disruption  of  the  rail  corridor  below.  Additionally,  using  the   precast  concrete  segments  saves  time  and  money,  reducing  the  platform  costs  from  $600   million  to  $300  million  (Levitt,  2011).  Public  entities  can  provide  information  to  developers  or   develop  best  practices  of  construction  technologies  that  reduce  ARD  costs.

Treating  the  Platform  as  a  Piece  of  Public  Infrastructure   Like  other  public  investments,  a  platform  is  piece  of  infrastructure  that  unlocks  private   investment  by  allowing  structures  to  be  built  upon  it.  Therefore,  the  developer  should  be   reimbursed  for  building  the  platform.  In  Boston's  Fenway  Center  ARD,  MassDOT  will  reimburse   the  developer  for  the  platform  costs  through  rent  credits  on  its  monthly  lease  payments.  This   essentially  erases  the  platform  costs,  thereby  making  ARD  competitive  with  terra  firma   development  (McMorrow,  2012).  Alternatively,  the  arrangement  can  be  similar  to  Ontario's  Tax   Increment  Equivalent  Grants  (TIEG),  where  developers  receive  annually  a  portion  of  the   property  tax  increase  over  ten  years.  Both  the  developer  and  public  entities  benefit  from  these   arrangements.  The  developer  does  not  have  to  bear  the  cost  of  building  a  platform,  making   ARD  more  economically  feasible.  Meanwhile,  public  entities  do  not  need  to  provide  the  upfront   capital  for  the  platform,  and  the  landowner  still  receives  air  rights  revenues,  and  regulator  or   local  jurisdiction  receives  property  tax  revenues  and  other  benefits.     Public  Financing  of  ARD  Construction   In  contrast  to  the  above  arrangement,  the  public  entity  can  provide  financing  for  the  ARD   construction  costs  by  issuing  bonds  (Goldschmidt,  1964;  Hauser,  1989).  The  developer  then   pays  off  these  bonds  through  development  revenues  when  the  project  is  generating  profits.   This  can  be  seen  in  Minneapolis'  new  football  stadium  development,  where  the  City  issued   bonds  for  construction  in  exchange  for  the  air  rights  over  a  parking  ramp,  developer  payments   over  the  next  ten  years  covering  the  anticipated  debt  service,  and  2%  of  the  net  operating   income  after  the  ten  years  (Minneapolis,  2014).  Another  comparable  arrangement  would  be   Tax  Increment  Financing  (TIF),  where  the  municipality  recoups  the  costs  of  a  public  investment   through  the  increase  in  property  taxes.  This  reduces  the  economic  burden  on  the  developer  of   ARD  projects,  while  the  public  entity  is  reimbursed  over  the  long  run  and  receives  additional   revenues  from  the  ARD  project.   Incentives   Section  5.4  will  look  into  incentives  in  more  detail.

5.2  Air  Space  Appraisal  
Assigning  a  value  to  air  space  can  be  difficult.  ARD  is  very  different  in  comparison  to  terra  firma   development,  and  established  valuation  approaches  may  not  be  applicable  to  determining  the   value  of  air  space.  There  are  several  approaches  that  can  be  used  to  appraise  air  space.   One  of  the  simpler  approaches  to  valuating  air  space  is  to  use  rule-of-thumb  calculations.  For   example,  the  Turnpike  Authority  has  a  history  of  valuating  air  rights  at  10%  of  total   development  costs  (Hauser,  1989).  Meanwhile,  Pine  (1970)  suggests  that  the  value  of  air  rights   should  be  no  more  than  half  of  the  adjoining  land  value.  While  these  approaches  are  simple,   they  do  not  capture  ARD  complexities  and  the  unique  qualities  of  each  ARD  site.   Another  approach  is  to  auction  the  air  rights  to  the  private  market  to  determine  the  valuation   (Pine,  1970).  New  York  has  a  history  of  auctioning  air  rights,  including  the  air  rights  for  the   Bridge  Apartments  over  the  Trans-Manhattan  expressway  which  was  one  of  the  first  ARDs  over   a  highway  (Chen,  2004).  Some  cities  choose  to  determine  the  valuation  through  the  RFP   process  where  developers  competitively  bid  on  the  air  rights.  This  approach  has  been  used  for   New  York's  Hudson  Yards  and  Ottawa's  Lansdowne  Park.  In  this  case,  the  valuation  of  air  space   is  determined  by  the  developer,  and  is  one  of  the  deciding  factors  within  the  RFP  evaluation.     A  more  formulaic  approach  is  to  use  the  comparative  land  value  method  (Williams  and   McNichol,  1973).  This  method  is  based  on  the  value  of  nearby  land,  incorporates  various  factors   associated  with  ARD,  and  is  premised  on  the  `highest  and  best  use'  of  the  site  (Dumfries,  1995;   Williams  &  McNichol,  1973).  The  formula  is  provided  below.   V  +  D  +  S  +  P  ­  X  ­  Y  ­  I  =  A   V  =  comparative  land  value   D  =  savings  due  to  absent  reduction  in   demolition  and  foundation  costs   S  =  value  attributed  to  site  prominence  or   improved  access   P  =  savings  due  to  readily  assembled  large   parcel   X  =  reduction  in  utility  of  structure  due  to   design   Y  =  excess  construction  costs  due  to   underlying  corridor   I  =  additional  interest  incurred  over  a  longer   construction  period   A  =  appraised  air  rights  value

Many  of  these  factors  are  estimates  and  are  open  to  interpretation  (Hauser,  1989).  Another   issue  with  this  approach  is  that  it  is  not  flexible  enough  to  accommodate  the  unique   characteristics  and  complexities  of  each  ARD  site.  Instead,  it  is  suggested  to  be  used  as  a   complimentary  and  supportive  approach  to  the  residual  income  approach.     The  residual  income  approach  uses  a  pro  forma  analysis  to  determine  the  air  space  value.  Hard   and  soft  costs  and  profit  margins  are  deducted,  and  the  resulting  amount  is  then  established  as   the  air  rights  rent.  This  approach  is  more  flexible  and  accommodates  ARD  site  complexities   (Hauser,  1989).     Another  option  is  to  allow  a  third-party  to  determine  the  fair  market  appraisal  of  the  air  space.   This  approach  has  been  used  by  the  City  of  Minneapolis,  where  a  professional  real  estate   appraiser  is  brought  in.  If  there  is  a  disagreement  on  the  fair  market  appraisal,  then  the  City  and   developer  each  hire  a  third-party  appraiser.  These  two  appraisers  then  mutually  hire  another   appraiser  to  determine  the  value  by  majority  vote.  If  the  two  parties  cannot  agree  to  a  third   appraiser,  then  the  State  steps  in  (Minneapolis,  1983).   Finally,  the  last  approach  is  tied  to  the  income  generated  by  the  ARD  project.  Some  ARD   developers  choose  to  share  a  portion  of  their  revenues  with  the  public  entity  landowner.  For   example,  the  ARD  above  the  Bethesda  Metrorail  station  in  the  Washington  Metro  Area  receives   a  minimum  revenue  of  $1.6  million,  and  receives  7.5%  of  annual  gross  revenues  in  excess  of   $31  million  (Mathur  &  Smith,  2012).  The  Miami-Dade  Transit's  ARD  agreement  over  the   Dadeland  South  Station  involves  the  agency  receiving  the  higher  of  $300,000  (consumer  price   index  adjusted)  or  4%  of  the  gross  revenue  (Mathur  &  Smith,  2012).  This  appraisal  approach  is   subject  to  market  volatility;  however,  it  may  be  more  attractive  to  developers  as  payments  are   adjusted  on  the  basis  of  the  project's  economic  performance.   A  final  note  about  the  air  space  appraisal  is  that  it  is  not  the  sole  deciding  factor  as  to  whether   an  ARD  project  is  implemented.  ARD  can  be  feasible  when  there  is  a  scarcity  of  available  sites   but  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  a  public  good  (Pine,  1970).  For  example,  affordable  housing  may

be  a  prominent  need  within  a  particular  area,  and  the  land  constraints  make  ARD  opportunities   the  most  feasible  option.   Whatever  approach  is  used,  the  valuation  process  needs  to  be  transparent,  and  the  public   entity  landowner  needs  to  effectively  communicate  this  process  to  the  public  and  the   developer  so  that  these  stakeholders  understand  the  nuances  of  the  appraisal  (Campbell,  2004;   Hauser,  1989).  The  valuation  of  air  space  should  also  be  predictable,  providing  the  developer  as   much  information  about  the  appraisal  process  and  ARD  site  as  possible  so  that  it  can  make   informed  decisions.  For  the  Columbus  Centre  ARD  project  in  Boston,  the  Turnpike  Authority  did   not  negotiate  the  air  space  value  until  after  the  design  was  finalized  and  permitted  by  the  City   of  Boston.  The  value  of  the  air  space  ended  up  being  three  to  four  times  higher  than  what  the   developer  initially  anticipated,  thereby  decimating  the  developer's  feasibility  analysis   (Campbell,  2004).  Overall,  the  developer  should  understand  the  appraisal  process  and  be  able   to  estimate  the  air  space  value  before  the  proposal  is  finalized.  

5.3  Tax  Assessment    
The  property  tax  revenue  generated  from  ARD  is  another  benefit  for  local  governments.  Like   local  zoning  regulations,  some  ARD  projects  have  been  exempt  from  property  taxes,  as  seen   with  Boston's  Gateway  Centre  ARD  (Clancy,  1998).  Today,  Massachusetts'  General  Laws  state   that  ARD  projects  may  be  exempt  from  property  taxes,  but  the  developer  must  still  make   payments  in  lieu  of  taxes  to  the  local  government  (Massachusetts,  2016).  The  majority  of  the   jurisdictions  studied  had  property  taxes  applying  to  ARD.   In  the  case  where  the  ground  and  air  space  parcels  have  different  owners,  taxes  are  typically   assessed  separately  (British  Columbia,  2016;  Zoning,  1974).  Taxation  of  ARD  projects  are  similar   to  terra  firma  projects,  where  the  taxes  are  applied  to  the  site  and  improvements  as  if  the   developer  were  the  landowner  (Campbell,  2004;  Clancy,  1998).  This  also  applies  to  leasing   arrangements,  as  seen  in  Massachusetts,  where  lessees  have  a  taxable  possessory  interest  and   are  treated  as  if  they  own  the  land  (Clancy,  1998;  Massachusetts,  2016).  However,  taxation   ultimately  depends  on  which  method  the  jurisdiction  uses  to  assess  property  taxes.  Some   jurisdictions  choose  to  tax  only  the  value  of  land,  or  may  tax  land  and  buildings  separately.  The

taxation  of  buildings  in  air  space  parcels  is  fairly  straightforward  as  they  are  comparable  to  terra   firma  buildings.  However,  air  space  parcels  are  not  located  on  land,  and  some  jurisdictions  such   as  Massachusetts  prohibit  the  value  of  land  to  be  included  in  the  tax  assessment  of  leased  air   rights  (Massachusetts,  2016).  Instead  of  using  the  `terra  firma'  value,  the  value  of  the  air  space   is  substituted  as  the  `land'  value  (Conveyance,  1964).  The  value  of  air  space  is  determined  by   various  methods  as  detailed  in  Section  5.2,  and  is  often  less  than  terra  firma  land  values  due  to   the  associated  costs  of  ARD.  Once  determined,  the  value  of  the  air  rights  lease  or  sale  is  then   used  in  the  property  tax  assessment.     There  are  additional  considerations  and  options  around  the  taxation  of  air  space.  ARD  property   taxes  may  be  further  divided  by  different  tax  classifications  since  the  ARD  has  different  uses,  as   practiced  in  Minneapolis.  Some  municipalities  choose  to  assign  a  proportion  of  the  complete   fee  tax  value.  For  example,  New  York  has  a  history  of  using  80%  of  the  complete  fee  rights  of   the  land  for  its  tax  assessment  value  of  ARD,  including  the  total  value  of  land,  buildings,  and   structural  supports  (Lillie,  1964).  Furthermore,  the  timing  of  taxation  is  another  consideration,   where  most  municipalities  tax  ARD  in  its  post-development  phase  (Lillie,  1964).  This  is  further   supported  by  the  fact  that  undeveloped  air  space  is  generally  not  classified  as  real  property  and   therefore  is  not  taxable  (Conveyance,  1964).  Lastly,  these  property  tax  complexities  must  be   understood  within  the  jurisdictional  context  before  corresponding  policies  and  agreements  are   created  for  ARD.  

5.4  Incentives  
There  are  several  incentives  that  public  entities  can  use  to  further  encourage  ARD,  including   both  financial  and  non-financial  incentives.  First,  public  entity  landowners  can  reduce  lease   payments  or  charge  below  market  value  to  incentivize  target  areas.  Property  tax  assessment   values  can  also  be  lowered  to  reduce  the  costs  for  developers  (Campbell,  2004;  Lillie,  1964).  For   example,  the  Hudson  Yards  developer  received  a  $328  million  real  estate  tax  exemption  from   the  City  for  an  80-story  tower  and  shopping  center  (Levitt,  2013).  The  tax  exemption  involves   the  developer  receiving  a  40%  tax  break  for  the  first  four  years,  with  decreasing  reductions  until   the  tax  breaks  end  after  25  years.  Public  entities  can  provide  financing  at  lower  rates  to  reduce

construction  costs  (Savvides,  2002).  Local  governments  can  allow  density  bonuses  to  increase   developer  revenues,  as  seen  in  the  Boston,  New  York,  and  Washington  D.C.  ARD  zonings.  Public   entities  can  also  provide  a  number  of  public  investments  within  the  ARD  project.  For  example,   the  Hudson  Yards  project  saw  the  City  of  New  York  invest  in  new  public  spaces  and  extend  the   Line  7  subway,  which  was  particularly  critical  to  the  area's  redevelopment.  Public  entities  can   agree  to  rent  space  in  the  new  development  as  a  way  of  securing  revenue  for  the  developer,   and  to  attract  other  tenants  (Savvides,  2002).  Finally,  local  governments  can  streamline   approval  processes  to  expedite  ARD  timelines,  thereby  saving  time  and  money  for  developers.   When  determining  whether  ARD  projects  should  receive  incentives,  public  entities  should   always  ensure  that  there  is  a  net  benefit  for  the  public  good.

6.0  Recommended  Steps  
This  report  provides  an  overview  of  how  the  literature  and  jurisdictions  address  the  political,   regulatory,  facilitation,  and  economic  issues  associated  with  ARD.  There  are  often  many  ways  to   address  these  issues,  and  the  proper  response  will  depend  on  the  local  context.  This  handbook   is  meant  to  act  as  a  resource  for  public  entities  to  use  in  order  to  build  an  effective   implementation  structure  for  ARD.  While  there  are  multiple  options  available,  this  research  has   identified  steps  that  public  entities  should  take  to  build  an  implementation  structure  that   facilitates  and  encourages  ARD,  and  ultimately  maximizes  the  public  benefits.  
   1.   Ensure  the  possession  of  powers  to  implement  ARD.  Before  a  public  entity  begins  to  

explore  ARD  opportunities,  it  needs  to  make  sure  that  it  has  the  legislative  authority  to   create  air  space  parcels.  A  general  overview  of  the  legal  context  is  encouraged  to   understand  what  the  public  entity  is  allowed  to  do,  and  to  identify  any  legislation  that   needs  to  be  created  or  amended.  
2.   Designate  an  office  or  committee  to  oversee  ARD  applications.  Both  the  municipality  and  

government  agency  should  designate  one  committee  to  be  responsible  for  liaising  with   other  departments  and  government  bodies,  which  will  help  the  private  market  to  interact   more  effectively.  It  also  makes  it  easier  for  the  public  and  the  developer  to  identify  who  is   responsible  for  overseeing  ARD  if  they  are  looking  for  more  information.  Typically,  the  office   responsible  for  the  public  entity's  real  estate  initiatives  would  oversee  ARD.  
3.   Establish  roles  and  responsibilities  amongst  stakeholders.  Providing  clarity  as  to  who  does  

what  and  when  they  are  involved  in  the  approval  process  facilitates  a  smoother   implementation  of  ARD  projects.  In  general,  the  province/state  grants  legislative  authority   and  plays  a  conflict  resolution  role,  the  local  government  approves  the  development,  the   landowner  negotiates  the  transaction  and  development  agreement,  the  public  provides   input  in  the  pre-RFP  and  final  review  stages,  and  the  developer  is  involved  throughout  the   process.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  within  the  development  agreement  should  also  be   established,  such  as  maintenance  and  operation  considerations.

4.   Create  partnerships  amongst  public  entities.  The  municipality,  government  agency,  and  

higher  orders  of  government  need  to  be  on  the  same  page  when  ARD  opportunities  arise.   Strong  working  relationships  need  to  be  established  to  facilitate  agreement  among  the   public  entities.  These  partnerships  can  be  created  by  aligning  the  priorities  of  the  public   entities  involved,  such  as  having  affordable  housing  or  job  linkage  policies  in  development   above  transit  infrastructure.  The  benefits  of  air  rights  revenues  should  also  be  clearly  and   fairly  distributed  so  that  each  stakeholder  participates  in  the  ARD  process.  
5.   Establish  procedural  clarity.  The  developer  should  understand  what  regulations  apply,  the  

RFP  process,  how  air  space  is  valuated,  what  the  development  agreement  involves,  and  the   municipal  approval  process  before  the  ARD  project  is  bid  on.  This  helps  the  developer  to   make  informed  decisions  on  its  proposal  and  will  prevent  obstacles  later  in  the   development  process.  
6.   Build  flexible  yet  guiding  regulations.  Local  government  regulations  should  apply  to  ARD  

projects.  These  local  regulations  need  to  balance  between  accommodating  the  unique   needs  of  an  ARD  site  but  also  providing  enough  direction  to  ensure  development  is  sensitive   to  the  local  context.  Certain  regulations  should  be  applied  generally  or  on  a  case-by-case   basis.  Standardized  regulations  for  ARD  include  construction  guidelines,  building  codes,   building  permits,  and  subdivision  applications.  Meanwhile,  master  plans,  zoning,  and   covenant  agreements  should  be  adapted  to  site-specific  needs.  Within  zoning,  parking  and   loading  requirements  are  typically  relaxed  while  added  height  and  density  may  be  necessary   to  make  the  project  economically  feasible.  Overall,  established  regulations  and  approval   processes  provide  direction  for  ARD,  which  helps  to  manage  expectations  among  the  public   and  developers.  
7.   Locate  ARD  opportunities.  The  government  agency,  local  government,  and  higher  orders  of  

government  (i.e.  state/province)  can  initiate  corridor-specific  or  city-wide  studies  of  ARD   opportunities.  These  studies  increase  awareness  within  the  private  market  of  ARD   opportunities.  Additionally,  it  allows  the  public  entities  to  prepare  for  ARD,  in  such  ways  as   rezoning,  incorporating  ARD  into  policy  documents,  and  setting  aside  funds  for  public   investments.

Nathan  Bunio,  April  2016  

8.   Consider  ARD  opportunities  with  new  public  investments.  Public  entities  should  use  a  

long-range  perspective  when  planning  future  investments,  including  considering  ARD  as  a   land  value  capture  tool.  ARD  opportunities  become  more  financially  feasible  when   integrated  into  the  initial  design  or  construction  phase.  This  could  include  setting  aside  land   within  the  medians  or  on  either  side  for  new  transportation  routes,  or  integrating  the   construction  of  new  public  buildings  with  ARD  construction.  ARD  opportunities  over  new   public  buildings,  such  as  libraries  and  transit  stations,  are  the  `low-hanging  fruit'  of  ARD   opportunities,  as  they  are  economically  feasible  and  do  not  involve  the  complexities  of   building  over  a  transportation  route.  Having  ARD  opportunities  in  mind  at  the  initial  stages   of  development  increases  the  likelihood  of  ARD  becoming  a  reality.    
9.   Incorporate  ARD  opportunities  into  master  plans.  Including  ARD  within  master  plans  can  

help  the  municipality  determine  the  appropriate  built  form  of  an  ARD  project  and  to   understand  how  the  site  connects  with  the  surrounding  areas.  It  can  also  bring  awareness   to  the  private  market  and  prepare  the  community  for  an  ARD  application.  Official  plans  or   over-arching  master  plans  should  include  policies  around  ARD  opportunities  and  may   indicate  general  locations.  Community  or  secondary  plans  should  specify  locations  for  ARD   and  detail  more  site-specific  policies.  
10.   Provide  public  amenities  and  incentives  for  ARD  projects.  Public  entities  can  invest  in  

public  amenities  such  as  parks  or  transit  improvements  that  improve  the  public  realm  and   make  ARD  opportunities  more  attractive  to  the  private  market.  Public  entities  can  also   provide  incentives  to  encourage  ARD,  however  these  should  be  weighed  against  the  net   public  benefits  resulting  from  ARD.  These  incentives  include  density  bonuses,  property  tax   breaks,  public  financing,  and  a  streamlined  approval  process.  
11.   Treat  the  platform  as  a  piece  of  public  infrastructure.  The  platform  needed  for  ARD  serves  

more  than  just  private  buildings.  It  can  complete  the  local  road  network,  provide  open   spaces,  clean  the  air  from  the  transportation  corridor  below,  increase  local  amenities,  and   can  provide  local  housing  and  jobs.  Ultimately,  the  platform  should  be  seen  as  a  piece  of   public  infrastructure  that  unlocks  development  opportunities.  With  this  perspective,  the   platform  costs  should  be  deducted  from  the  rent  or  sale  of  the  air  space,  which  reduces

costs  and  make  ARD  competitive  with  terra  firma  development.  Public  financing  options   such  as  TIEGs  or  TIFs  should  also  be  explored  for  the  platform  construction.  
12.   Make  ARD  information  readily  available  for  the  developers  and  the  public.  Creating  

various  policy  documents  and  guidelines  for  ARD,  and  having  these  available  online  and   through  other  means,  is  beneficial  for  the  community  and  the  private  market.  These   documents  can  include  construction  guidelines,  the  approval  process,  the  solicitation   process,  and  TOD  or  joint  development  criteria.  This  also  helps  to  facilitate  a  smoother   implementation  process.  
13.   Educate  the  public  on  ARD  issues.  ARD  tends  to  be  controversial  since  it  involves  selling  a  

public  good  and  is  typically  located  in  central  areas.  Efforts  should  be  made  to  increase   community  understanding  of  ARD  issues.  The  public  should  recognize  the  benefits,  the   economic  costs,  and  the  trade-off  between  public  amenities  and  increased  density   surrounding  the  implementation  of  ARD.  
14.   Pursue  ARD  during  favourable  market  conditions.  Surrounding  land  values  need  to  be  high  

enough  in  order  to  justify  the  costs  of  ARD,  which  are  dependent  on  the  real  estate  cycle.   ARD  should  be  pursued  when  the  market  returns  are  above  this  economic  threshold.  This   helps  to  mitigate  the  amount  of  public  financial  incentives  needed  to  make  the  ARD  project   financially  feasible.  
15.   Test  implementation  structure  through  a  demonstration  project.  When  a  public  entity  has  

created  or  significantly  modified  their  implementation  structure  for  ARD,  it  is  advisable  to   choose  a  development  as  a  test-pilot  project  in  order  to  evaluate  the  implementation   structure.  Additionally,  this  demonstration  project  should  be  small  in  scale  to  limit  the   impacts  and  complexities  involved.  Public  entities  may  also  use  a  consulting  firm  to  oversee   the  pilot  project,  which  helps  to  save  municipal  staff  and  resources.  Using  a  demonstration   project  helps  to  identify  areas  of  improvement  within  the  implementation  structure.  It  also   helps  to  build  administrative  capacity  and  increase  awareness  among  the  general  public  and   the  developers,  highlighting  the  challenges  and  benefits  of  ARD.  Overall,  a  demonstration   project  can  improve  the  current  implementation  structure  and  boost  support  for  this  type   of  development.

ARD  certainly  has  several  complexities.  It  often  takes  multiple  years  to  be  approved  and  can   encounter  several  obstacles  along  the  way.  However,  when  ARD  is  implemented,  it  can  have   positive  impacts  on  the  transportation  corridor,  the  surrounding  area,  and  the  entire  city.  By   building  an  implementation  structure  and  addressing  the  various  issues  outlined  in  this  report,   public  entities  take  tremendous  steps  towards  making  ARD  a  reality.  Even  though  ARD  may  not   be  feasible  for  a  municipality  at  the  moment,  an  implementation  structure  should  be  in  place  so   that  the  public  entities  and  private  market  are  able  to  capitalize  when  the  opportunity  comes.   Public  entities  will  continue  to  learn  what  works  as  they  implement  ARD  projects.  Hopefully  this   report  helps  public  entities  to  develop  their  own  best  practices  for  ARD.
