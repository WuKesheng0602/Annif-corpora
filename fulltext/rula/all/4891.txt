THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS LEVEL ON THE RATCHETING MAGNITUDE AND PROGRESS RATE IN STEEL ALLOYS UNDER UNIAXIAL LOADING CONDITIONS

Master of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, 2016 Prasanth Chandrasekar, 2016

ABSTRACT Engineering materials in their service life undergo symmetric or asymmetric fatigue loading, which leads to fatigue damage in the material. Ratcheting damage is due to the application of mean stress under cyclic loading condition. From deformation behavior perspective, application of mean stress under stress-controlled fatigue loading gives rise to accumulation of plastic strain in the material. Ratcheting strain increases with an increase in applied mean stress and stress amplitude. In addition, ratcheting behavior will increase in cyclic damage with the rise in strain accumulation and it can be illustrated by a shift in the hysteresis loop towards large plastic strain amplitudes. This study focuses on the ratcheting behavior of different steel materials under uniaxial cyclic loading condition and suggests a suitable method to arrest ratcheting by loading the materials at zero ratcheting strain rate condition with specified mean stress and stress amplitudes. The threedimensional surface is created with stress amplitude, mean stress and ratcheting strain rate for different steel materials. This represents a graphical surface zone to study the ratcheting strain rates for various mean stress and stress amplitude combinations. Keywords: fatigue loading, ratcheting strain, cyclic damage, mean stress and stress amplitudes, plastic strain amplitude, ratcheting strain rate, graphical surface zone.

CHAPTER 1 Problem Definition and Introduction 1.1 Problem Definition Ratcheting behavior is seen in all engineering materials subjected to cyclic loading with mean stress. Due to this ratcheting action, the estimated fatigue life of the component reduces, and the life of the material decreases from its estimated life span, so the ratcheting strain needs to be reduced as much as possible to increase component life.

1.2 Introduction Engineering components in their service life undergo symmetric fatigue loading or asymmetric fatigue loading. Most fatigue damage is greatly influenced by mean stress. From deformation behavior perspective, application of mean stress under stress-controlled fatigue loading gives rise to ratcheting action, which results in accumulation of plastic strain during low cycle fatigue loading [1]. Ratcheting effect not only produces the large deformation but also the fatigue damage in the material; this reduces the life of material. Fatigue life of the material degrades due to the accumulation of ratcheting strain, as shown by the Coffin Mansion Relation. For the past few years, several experiments and simulations have been done to study the degradation of the material due to material nature and imposed stress parameters [2]. Hence in design and structural component assessments of a material, ratcheting-fatigue interaction is more significant due to ratcheting-fatigue failure of material due to cyclic stress loading on the material. 1.3 Ratcheting Assessment The uniaxial ratcheting behavior of different steel materials were examined with different mean stress (m) and different stress amplitude (a) combinations at room temperature. Ratcheting strains at the different stages were investigated at various types of loading cycles. The schematic triphasic trend of ratcheting strain over stress cycles is shown in Fig. 1.1.

CHAPTER 2 Materials and Testing Method 2.1 Introduction The present thesis mainly focuses on uniaxial ratcheting behavior in stage II of different steels, such as interstitial free steel, 16MnR steel, SS304 stainless steel, 42CrMo steel alloy, SS316L steel, 20 CS steel, 1020 steel, SA 333 Gr6C-Mn steel, and HC340LA steel alloy. 2.2 Experimental Ratcheting Test The ratcheting behavior of a material under uniaxial or multi-axial cyclic loading for different mean and amplitude stresses have been studied in many scholarly journals. The steel specimen used to study the ratcheting behavior is made into a solid cylindrical bar of 10 mm diameter and 30 mm gauge length. Before the material is cyclically tested, the tensile test is performed to study the fundamental properties of the material used for cyclic loadings, such as elastic modulus and yield strength. Ratcheting testing is carried out on electro-hydraulic servo fatigue testing machine. The mechanical loading process is performed in a controlled manner, and experimental data are gathered by the teststar control system that is attached to the testing machine [4]. The axial strain is measured using a strain extensometer of certain limit (i.e., 10% - 50%). The specimen geometry for ratcheting test is shown in Fig. 2.1.

Fig.2.1: Specimen geometry for ratcheting test [5].

Based on the test controlled, testing can be classified into two categories that are as follows (i) constant mean stress with varying stress amplitude (ii) constant stress amplitude with varying mean stress. An example of schematic loading path for ratcheting test as shown in Fig. 2.2.

Fig.2.2: schematic loading path for ratcheting test [2].

Ratcheting stain (r) is defined as the average of maximum and minimum strain obtained using extensometer and r given by r = ( max + min )/2 (2.1)

From the Eq. 2.1, we can find the ratcheting rate dr/dN after each cycle is calculated, where N is number of cycles. Ratcheting stain effect on fatigue life of the material is investigated by testing the material under uniaxial cyclic stress at room temperature with various mean stress and stress amplitude till the failure occurs. For example Table 2.1 shows the range of mean stress and stress amplitude to study the ratcheting behavior in interstitial free steel [2].

Table 2.1: Mean stress and stress amplitude for ratcheting test in interstitial free (IF) steel [2]. Serial number 1 2 3  (MPa) 10 20 30  (MPa) 130,140,150 130,140,150 130,140,150

From the Table 2.1 it is clear that material is subjected to three different types of loading with constant stress amplitude (130,140and 150 MPa) and varying mean stress (10, 20 and 30 MPa). 2.3 Accumulation of Ratcheting Strain The accumulation of ratcheting strain takes place when the material is subjected to asymmetric cyclic loading with some mean stress values. The nature of the hysteresis loop varies based on the level of imposed mean stress. From the stress-strain curve for IF steel shown by k. Dutta et al., that with varying mean stress of 10, 20 and 30 MPa and constant stress amplitude of 140 MPa for 100 cycles, it is clear that the hysteresis loop shifts towards the positive plastic strain with the increase in applied mean stress. Plastic strain magnitude for the above figure with the mean stress of 10, 20 and 30 MPa is 3.6%, 5.3% and 6.1%. The similar experiment is performed for different steels and steel alloys with different mean stress and stress amplitude for the different number of cycles. Ratcheting strain with that of number loading cycles for IF steel is shown in the Fig. 2.3. The increase in loading cycles will result in an increase in accumulation of ratcheting strain for any m and a combinations.

From Fig. 2.3 it is clear that ratcheting strain increases with increases in applied mean stress and amplitude stress. Similarly, we can study the ratcheting behaviour of the material by keeping mean stress as constant and varying the stress amplitude as shown in Fig. 2.4.

CHAPTER 3 Mathematical Models for Ratcheting Strain Prediction 3.1 Parametric triphasic ratcheting equation Accumulation of ratcheting strain over three stages of material lifespan is formulated [8]. The ratcheting response of different materials over a stress cycles Nf is expressed as follows

From the equation above the term  is the stress range, 2a.

Eq. 3.1 represents the triphasic ratcheting strain accumulation over certain life cycles of the material as shown in the Fig. 3.1. This equation represents the three different stages of ratcheting strain rate. In stage I the ratcheting strain rate drops while in stage II it remains steady and in Stage III it is found that there is a sudden increase in ratcheting strain rate that leads to failure.

Fig. 3.1: Parametric triphasic ratcheting strain over Nf [8]. 3.2 Hardening rule The theory of cyclic plasticity is based on the strain increment due to elastic and plastic strain components [17], and it can be represented as  =  +

From hooks law, the elastic part is explained as  = 2 -  ( . ) Plastic part is defined as the  =  (. )

2 ( , ,  ) = 2 (  -  ). (  -  ) -  =0 3

(3.10)

Under the stressed plastic deformation, yield surface movement direction is dictated by the hardening rule. A nonlinear hardening model is developed by Armstrong-Frederick [12] as  =   -   where  =  .

 and  are material constants of strain-controlled uniaxial stress-strain hysteresis loop. The first term in the Eq. (3.11) refers to strain hardening and second term is nonlinear trend in hardening rule. Plastic modulus function is defined as  =  - ( .  ) (3.13)

The ratcheting response in A-F model was overestimating hence Bower modified A-F model to predict ratcheting strain rate and was defined as Bower's hardening rule  =   - 1 (  -) where  = 2 (  -) (3.15)


(3.14)

10

This rule consists of three variables , 1  2 as material constant, first feedback rate to control the stress-strain hysteresis loop and second feedback rate to determine the ratcheting rate. But Bower's ratcheting rule experienced ratcheting arrest and premature plastic shakedown and hence it is limited by the number of cycles and not beyond the stage I. Ahmadzadeh and Varvani-Farahani extended the bower's rule to study the ratcheting response of the material under long range of loading cyclic in stage I and II and it is named as A-V model.

where 1 and 2 and K are material constants. 1 relates to mean stress level and 2 remains unchanged for steels.

CHAPTER 4 Results and Discussion 4.1 Introduction This thesis focuses only on ratcheting behaviour of different steels at stage II due to uniaxial loading. Ratcheting strain rate is calculated using the tangent of ratcheting strain and loading cycle graph as shown in Fig. 4.1. Ratcheting strain rate = Angular tangent (a/ b) = dr/dN =  (4.1)

Hence from the above, the formula ratcheting strain rate for different material at different mean stress and stress amplitude is obtained.

From the Table 4.1 for zero ratcheting strain rate we obtain the corresponding mean stress and stress amplitude for different steel materials using the linear equation generated from the Fig. 4.2 to 4.14. The slope, m and y-intercept, c values are obtained using Matlab coding. Hence by loading the material using these mean stress and stress amplitude we can arrest the ratcheting or reduce ratcheting up to the large extent in the material. Hence, finally the material life can be increased. 4.3 Mean and amplitude stress relations Materials are used to steady cyclic loading subjected deformation; hence the material response is studied with the help of applied mean stress and stress amplitude subjected to loading cycles. Two dimensions XY graph is plotted with stress amplitude/yield stress as X component and mean stress/yield stress as Y component. An exponential curve is drawn using Matlab coding and the corresponding equation is obtained for different steel material as listed in Table 4.2.

4.4 Three dimensional ratcheting surface zone Ratcheting three-dimensional surface zone is formulated by combining the solutions of ratcheting strain rate with constant mean stress and varying stress amplitude and also with constant stress amplitude and varying mean stress of different steel alloys from Fig. 4.27 Â­ 4.37. The mathematical equation used to generate this three-dimensional surface is as follows  = (m1.m + m2.a +c1+c2)/2 (4.4)

where  = ratcheting strain rate, m = mean stress, a = stress amplitude, m1 and m2 are slope and c1 and c2 are y intercepts of the linear equation at constant mean stress and constant stress amplitude condition.

27

The result shows an irregularly inclined surface. Therefore, we can find the respective for different mean and amplitude stress graphically.

4.5 Overview From Fig. 4.27 Â­ 4.37 it can be shown that the ratcheting strain of various steel alloys can be found for different sets of applied mean and amplitude stress. The three-dimensional surface zone is constructed with certain boundary limits of maximum mean and amplitude stresses applied in the experiment. The boundaries can be increased by extending the trend line without changing the slopes and intercepts.

CHAPTER 5 Conclusion The accumulation of ratcheting strain in different steels due to uniaxial loading is found to increase if the magnitude of mean stress increases with constant stress amplitude condition. The ratcheting strain increases with an increase in the magnitude of stress amplitude with constant mean stress state. Cyclic damage in the material increases with an increase in strain accumulation that is illustrated by the hysteresis loop shifting towards the large plastic strain amplitude; due to this ratcheting phenomenon dislocation density in samples increases. The process of ratcheting can be evaluated in three stages, in stage I ratcheting strain rate decreases with increase in the loading cycles. In stage II ratcheting strain rate reaches a constant with further increase in cycles and during this stage only ratcheting strain keeps on growing at a steady rate. In the final stage, ratcheting strain rate increases drastically until the failure occurs. Hence from Table 2.1 we can conclude that ratcheting can be arrested and cannot be increased further if the material is loaded under zero ratcheting strain rate condition with specified mean stress and stress amplitude. The three dimensional ratcheting surface is formulated for different steel materials to study the ratcheting behavior of those materials under various combinations of mean and amplitude stresses. These graphs are expressed with the help of experimental results of certain sets of mean and stress amplitude conditions. Multiple sets of stress combinations and their corresponding ratcheting rate can be obtained with some limited sets of experimental results. As a consequence, experimentation cost and time can be saved.
