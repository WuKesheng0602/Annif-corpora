ABSTRACT  
   Persons  displaced  by  conflict  are  considered  especially  vulnerable  to  sexual  abuse  by  peacekeepers.   While  the  UN  reports  publicly  on  allegations  of  "sexual  exploitation  and  abuse"  by  peacekeepers,  it   is  widely  acknowledged  that  under-reporting  is  a  significant  problem.  Proposed  qualitative   research  involving  local  civil  society  organizations  and  community  leaders  supporting  victims  in   the  context  of  displacement  will  elicit  their  perceptions  on  the  barriers  to,  and  challenges   associated  with,  formal  reporting.  The  planned  study,  set  out  as  a  proposal,  will  assess  perceptions   of  current  reporting  structures  and  recent  UN  reforms  regarding  "community-based  complaint   reception  mechanisms."  This  will  inform  further  research  and  consultations  into  the  design  of  more   appropriate  reporting  structures.  The  research's  dissemination,  linked  to  the  Code  Blue  campaign's   advocacy  to  end  impunity  for  sexual  violence  by  peacekeepers,  will  seek  to  convince  UN  decision- makers  that  systemic  reforms  are  needed  to  ensure  that  victims  have  better  access  to  appropriate   support  and  criminal  justice.      Keywords:  internally  displaced  persons;  refugees;  sexual  violence;  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse;   under-reporting;  peacekeeping;  United  Nations

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  AND  DEDICATION  
   I  would  like  to  thank  my  MRP  supervisor,  Professor  Myer  Siemiatycki,  for  his  significant   encouragement,  support  and  input.  Professor  Siemiatycki  was  an  invaluable  source  of  inspiration   and  connections  for  me  during  my  time  at  Ryerson  University,  and  his  faith  in  me,  coupled  with  his   compassion  and  our  shared  passion  for  social  justice,  enabled  me  to  persevere  despite  challenging   personal  circumstances.  I  am  also  grateful  for  the  input  and  support  from  my  second  reader,   Assistant  Professor  Miriam  Anderson.  I  appreciated  her  insightful  and  thought-provoking   comments,  excellent  further  reading  suggestions  and  encouragement  to  take  this  research  forward.   I  would  also  like  to  thank  the  other  professors  and  staff  associated  with  the  ISS  program  and  my   fellow  students  who  have  supported  me  along  the  way.      I  am  humbled  by  the  passion,  dedication,  creativity  and  intellect  of  my  colleagues  at  AIDS-Free   World  and  our  collaborators  on  the  Code  Blue  campaign,  and  acknowledge  that  the  paper's  content   and  analysis  has  been  shaped  by  their  keen  insights.  In  particular,  I  thank  our  co-Directors,  Paula   Donovan  and  Stephen  Lewis,  for  their  support,  patience  and  encouragement  as  I  completed  this   paper,  and  for  their  expert  guidance  in  the  landscape  of  feminist  social  justice  advocacy.  I  am  most   grateful  to  Dr.  Rosa  Freedman  for  her  thoughtful  insights  and  suggestions,  and  for  her  unwavering   enthusiasm  for  this  project.      I  thank  my  family  and  friends  for  the  steadfast  encouragement  (and  gentle  nudging),  and  especially   my  parents,  Diane  and  Eric,  for  providing  such  a  supportive  and  caring  environment  for  me  to  focus   on  completing  my  paper.  My  father  Eric  helped  me  think  through  the  more  challenging  aspects  of   this  project.      This  paper  is  dedicated  to  my  late  brother  Aaron,  whose  sharp  intellect  and  passion  for  social   justice  through  the  law  (and  its  reform)  serves  as  an  enduring  inspiration.

Preface:  Situating  the  problem,  the  author  and  the  MRP  
The  boys,  some  of  whom  were  orphans,  disclosed  sexual  exploitation,  including  rape  and   sodomy,  between  December  2013  and  June  2014  by  French  troops  at  a  centre  for  internally   displaced  people  at  M'Poko  airport  in  Bangui.  The  children  described  how  they  were   sexually  exploited  in  return  for  food  and  money.  One  11-year-old  boy  said  he  was  abused   when  he  went  out  looking  for  food.  A  nine-year-old  described  being  sexually  abused  with   his  friend  by  two  French  soldiers  at  the  IDP  camp  when  they  went  to  a  checkpoint  to  look   for  something  to  eat...  The  report  describes  how  distressed  the  child  was  when  disclosing   the  abuse  and  how  he  fled  the  camp  in  terror  after  the  assault.1   Over  the  past  year,  the  UN  has  faced  a  renewed  crisis  of  confidence  and  conscience,  stemming  from   allegations  of  sexual  abuse  against  children  in  a  displaced  persons'  camp  by  peacekeepers  in  the   Central  African  Republic  (CAR).  These  horrors  were  first  exposed  by  AIDS-Free  World's  Code  Blue   campaign  through  a  report  in  The  Guardian  in  April  2015.  Since  then,  multiple  allegations  -  many   involving  internally  displaced  women  and  girls  -  have  continued  to  be  brought  forward  by   journalists,  civil  society  organizations  and  the  UN,  although  primarily  in  CAR.2  The  Code  Blue   campaign  has  continued  to  be  at  the  forefront  of  these  efforts,  including  by  revealing  the  UN's   failure  to  disclose  shocking  new  allegations  in  CAR  in  March  and  April  2016.3  These  latest   allegations  involve  over  a  hundred  reported  victims,  many  of  whom  are  minors  and  likely  internally   displaced  persons  (IDPs).  Some  of  the  victims  were  further  displaced  after  their  abuse  as  a  result  of   community  stigmatization.4   I  am  currently  the  project  coordinator  of  "Code  Blue,"  the  advocacy  campaign  seeking  to  end   impunity  for  sexual  violence  by  UN  peacekeeping  personnel.  The  Code  Blue  campaign,  which  was   formally  launched  by  the  non-governmental  advocacy  organization  AIDS-Free  World  and  its  allies   in  May  2015,  has  re-ignited  and  sustained  global  attention  to  a  long-standing  problem.  As

   coordinator  of  the  Code  Blue  campaign,  I  regularly  work  with  academics,  advocates,  and  UN   decision-makers  to  advance  the  campaign's  aims  and  objectives.5  My  role  also  includes  researching   the  problem  of  Â­  and  possible  solutions  to  Â­  impunity  for  "sexual  exploitation  and  abuse"  (SEA)6  by   peacekeepers.     ...there  might  be  reporting  biases  depending  on  inter  alia  the  location  of  SEA,  the  existence   of  reporting  mechanisms,  as  well  as  international  media  and  NGO  attention.  For  these   reasons,  the  reported  SEA  might  be  the  "tip  of  the  iceberg."7     My  research  for  the  Code  Blue  campaign  has  uncovered  the  severity  of  under-reporting  of  sexual   exploitation  and  abuse,  despite  the  limited  quantitative  studies  demonstrating  the  extent  of  this   problem.  The  UN  has  spent  years  implying  that  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  is  diminishing   because  the  number  of  annual  reported  allegations  is  generally  decreasing.  The  UN  attributes  the   decline  in  reported  allegations  to  its  reform  efforts  -  despite  its  own  assertions  that  even  one  case  is   "one  too  many."8  Yet  it  is  crucial  to  note  that  even  the  few  studies  that  do  exist  demonstrate  a  wide   gulf  between  what  occurs  on  the  ground  and  the  "official"  statistics  produced  by  the  UN.  One   striking  study  conducted  in  Liberia  showed  that  an  estimated  58,000  women  were  involved  in   transactional  sex  with  UN  personnel  (prohibited  as  "sexual  exploitation,"  as  will  be  explored  further   in  this  paper)  over  a  9-year  period  ending  in  2012,  while  the  UN  only  recorded  69  allegations  from   2007-2012  in  Liberia.9     Over  the  course  of  research  undertaken  and  consultations  conducted  with  my  Code  Blue  colleagues,   we  have  identified  multiple  problems  with  the  UN's  data  and  the  way  it  reports  on  allegations.  It  is   difficult  to  independently  verify  the  UN's  data,  not  least  because  the  UN  Â­  via  its  Conduct  and   Discipline  Unit  (CDU)  -  is  the  only  body  that  comprehensively  tracks,  compiles  and  reports  on  the   allegations.  Furthermore,  the  UN  has  a  vested  interest  in  ensuring  a  downward  trend  in  reported

allegations,  to  make  it  appear  as  though  it  is  effectively  handling  the  problem.  It  is  therefore  likely   that  many  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  are  not  counted  in  the  overall  total  published   by  the  UN.     In  November  2015,  a  Thomson  Reuters  Foundation  journalist  reported  that  he  had  uncovered  three   new  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  in  CAR.10  Those  allegations  were  reported  to  the   UN,  and  the  Organization  subsequently  indicated  that  it  was  conducting  investigations.  Given  my   significant  interest  in,  and  work  on,  this  area,  I  considered  proposing  research  to  expose  additional   incidents  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  not  reported  to  the  UN  in  order  to  add  to  academic   studies  and  journalistic  accounts  of  the  under-reporting  problem.  However,  on  reflection,  I  decided   against  this  approach  for  a  number  of  reasons.  There  are  serious  ethical  considerations  around   "discovering"  unreported  sexual  violence,  particularly  in  situations  where  law  enforcement  and   justice  systems  are  inadequate,  compromised  or  non-existent.  Those  issues  are  even  more  serious   where  minors  are  involved,  especially  where  those  minors  are  internally  displaced  within  conflict   zones  and  when  they  may  lack  parental  or  community  support.  Such  "investigative"  quantitative   research  remains  an  important  area  of  study  to  be  conducted  by  qualified  and  conscientious   researchers.  However,  I  determined  that  given  my  own  training,  skillset  and  role  in  the  Code  Blue   campaign  -  alongside  the  limited  opportunities  to  conduct  ethically-sound  field  research  Â­  it  would   be  more  appropriate  for  me  to  propose  qualitative  research  on  the  barriers  to,  and  challenges   associated  with,  reporting,  to  inform  possible  solutions  to  these  problems.    Of  course,  there  are   many  inter-linked  areas  that  require  further  research;  this  proposed  research  project  would   contribute  to  exploring  one  of  the  gaps  identified.     This  MRP  is  an  "applied"11  paper,  outlining  a  problem  identified  by  an  advocacy  campaign  and   proposing  field  research  to  contribute  to  exploring  and  understanding  the  problem.  It  is  anticipated   that  the  MRP  will  form  the  foundation  of  a  research  project  to  be  coordinated  and  commissioned  by   AIDS-Free  World's  Code  Blue  campaign,  with  the  field  research  and  subsequent  analysis  and   publication  of  the  findings  to  be  carried  out  by  independent  academic  researchers.  In  other  words,   the  MRP  shows  how  a  proposed  research  project  could  provide  insights  to  address  a  research   problem  and  advance  the  goals  of  an  advocacy  campaign  seeking  to  address  these  problems.  As

Overview  of  the  problem  
The  recent  revelations  of  widespread  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  in  the  Central   African  Republic  (CAR)  raise  an  underlying  and  crucial  question  about  whether  the  problem  is   specific  to  the  UN's  MINUSCA  mission  in  CAR,  as  senior  UN  officials  have  implied,  or  whether  the   current  UN  and  international  spotlight  on  CAR  obfuscates  abuses  that  persist  in  other  peacekeeping   operations.13  Undoubtedly,  it  is  the  latter:  the  latest  allegations  emerge  against  a  backdrop  of  a   long-standing  awareness  by  the  UN  of  the  problem  and  rhetoric  condemning  it,  stemming  initially   from  scandals  in  Cambodia,  Somalia  and  Bosnia  in  the  1990s.  In  2002,  the  UN  Secretary-General   proclaimed:   Sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by  humanitarian  staff  cannot  be  tolerated.  It  violates   everything  the  United  Nations  stands  for.  Men,  women  and  children  displaced  by  conflict  or

other  disasters  are  among  the  most  vulnerable  people  on  earth.  They  look  to  the  United   Nations  and  its  humanitarian  partners  for  shelter  and  protection.14   This  pronouncement  came  as  part  of  a  2002  UN  report  investigating  a  massive  scandal  involving   aid  workers  and  peacekeepers  abusing  children  in  refugee  camps  in  West  Africa.  The  report  found   that  "the  conditions  in  the  camps  and  in  refugee  communities  in  the  three  countries  in  question   make  refugees  vulnerable  to  sexual  and  other  forms  of  exploitation  and  such  vulnerability  increases   if  one  is  a  female  and  young."15  Prior  to  that  scandal,  in  1995,  UNHCR  (the  refugee  protection   agency)  released  guidelines  on  Sexual  Violence  Against  Refugees  that  outlined  these  risks  and   proposed  steps  to  mitigate  and  address  them.  At  the  same  time,  civil  society  organizations  had  for   years  been  sounding  the  alarm  on  concerns  arising  from  the  specific  vulnerability  of  displaced   children  to  sexual  predators,  including  peacekeepers.   The  problem  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by  UN  peacekeepers  is  inextricably  linked  to  the   vulnerability  of  displaced  persons,  whom  those  peacekeepers  are  frequently  sent  to  protect.  The  UN   has  long  recognized  that  "internal  displacement  implies  a  double  vulnerability,  to  both  the  cause  of   displacement  and  to  the  tenuousness  of  well-being  and  security  at  points  of  destination."16  Indeed,   GraÃ§a  Machel's  landmark  1996  study,  Impact  of  Armed  Conflict  on  Children,  undertaken  at  the   request  of  the  UN  Secretary-General  (SG),  is  considered  the  first  UN  report  to  highlight  sexual   exploitation  and  abuse  by  peacekeepers  and  to  focus  international  attention  on  the  specific  plight  of   displaced  children.  In  six  of  the  twelve  countries  surveyed  for  the  report,  "the  arrival  of   peacekeeping  troops  has  been  associated  with  a  rapid  rise  in  child  prostitution,"  and  the  report   emphasizes  that  "girls  in  flight  are  even  more  vulnerable  than  usual  to  sexual  abuse."17   The  problem  is  compounded  by  the  severe  under-reporting  of  sexual  violence  alleged  to  have  been   committed  by  peacekeepers,  which  is  likely  even  worse  than  the  abysmally  low  rates  of  reporting  of   sexual  violence  in  other  contexts:

   Given  that  victims  of  sexual  violence  worldwide  find  it  difficult,  unsafe,  or  futile  to  report   sexual  offenses  to  law  enforcement,  it  would  be  unrealistic  to  assume  that  the  allegations   reported  to  the  UN  represent  all  or  even  most  of  the  offenses  committed.18       It  is  understood  that  the  problem  of  under-reporting  is  even  more  complex  in  the  context  of   displacement.  Numerous  studies  have  shown  that  "the  true  scale  of  sexual  violence  against  refugees   is  unknown  because  numerous  incidents  are  never  reported."19  This  can  include  because  of   difficulties  knowing  about  reporting  structures  in  a  host  site;  language  or  cultural  barriers;  lack  of   trust  in  local  authorities,  organizations  or  the  UN,  groups  that  are  responsible  for  receiving   complaints;  and  stigma  and  discrimination  by  the  host  communities,  to  name  a  few.   It  goes  without  saying  that  "under-reporting  also  perpetuates  a  lack  of  accountability  for  the  abuse,   since  it  underplays  the  scale  of  the  problem."20  Yet  a  near-total  lack  of  criminal  accountability  for   sexual  violence  by  peacekeepers  contributes  to  a  sense  of  futility  for  victims,  or  worse,  possible   negative  repercussions  for  those  who  do  report  these  crimes  to  the  UN  or  other  authorities.21  As  a   result  a  vicious  cycle  perpetuates  this  problem,  as  would-be  criminals  are  emboldened  to  engage  in   activities  they  might  otherwise  feel  compelled  to  refrain  from  for  fear  of  punishment.  In  contexts   where  armed  conflicts  are  threatened,  ongoing,  or  only  recently  quelled,  with  local  protection  and   legal  systems  potentially  weak,  damaged  or  destroyed,  a  culture  of  impunity  for  sexual  violence,   including  by  those  sent  in  to  protect  civilians,  becomes  the  norm.     The  UN  has  attempted  to  address  the  crisis  over  the  years,  yet  fundamental  flaws  in  its  prevention,   response  and  assistance  mechanisms  contribute  to  the  general  culture  of  impunity.  In  terms  of  the   reporting  context,  the  UN  is  mandated  to  report  data  on  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by  its  own   personnel,  under  its  General  Assembly  Resolution  57/306  (which  was  issued  following  the  UN's   investigation  into  the  allegations  of  abuse  against  refugees  in  West  Africa  in  2001-2002).  Yet   experts  widely  acknowledge  that  the  UN  under-reports  the  scope  of  the  problem,  as  it  only  includes

those  instances  where  victims  have  formally  brought  allegations  to  the  UN's  attention,  whether   directly  or  through  indirect  reporting  mechanisms  (primarily  local  non-governmental   organizations).  Moreover,  its  reporting  system  can  count  several  incidents,  or  one  incident   involving  multiple  perpetrators  and/or  multiple  victims,  as  one  single  "allegation,"  in  a  system  that   appears  unique  to  the  UN  (which  has  no  criminal  justice  mechanism  itself).  Furthermore,  it  does   not  include  reports  of  abuse  committed  by  peacekeepers  who  are  authorized  by  the  UN  but  are  not   directly  serving  under  a  UN  banner,  such  as  the  French  Sangaris  troops  accused  of  raping  young   boys  in  CAR  in  2014.  And  while  improvements  are  being  rolled  out  in  2016,  in  relation  to  the   timeliness  and  breadth  of  information  the  UN  provides  publicly  on  allegations  and  follow-up,  it   remains  difficult  to  track  and  understand  the  data  (for  example,  there  are  no  case  numbers  nor  are   the  incident  dates  listed).  This  further  hampers  transparency  and  accountability  efforts.       In  2015,  the  UN  committed  to  rolling  out  a  "model  complaint  reception  mechanism,"  to  provide   victims  with  "additional  community-based  reporting  options,  rather  than  having  to  report  to  the   United  Nations."22  This  may  well  have  been  instigated  in  response  to  concerns  about  under- reporting,  and  in  the  context  of  claiming  better  enforcement  of  its  "zero  tolerance"  policy  on  sexual   exploitation  and  abuse.  Yet  it  is  difficult  to  understand  why  the  UN  has  taken  so  long  to  develop  and   roll-out  such  a  model.  Moreover,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  model  is  based  on  a  thorough  assessment   or  whether  it  is  simply  a  "quick-fix"  response  to  the  many  allegations  that  have  been  brought  to   light,  and  the  public  scrutiny  and  outcry  over  the  past  12  months.   It  will  be  important  for  civil  society  to  assess  whether  the  UN's  new  approach  is  actually  improving   the  reporting  experience  and  outcomes,  particularly  for  vulnerable  displaced  girls,  and  contributing   to  ending  impunity  for  these  abuses.  This  is  critical,  because,  anecdotally  and  beyond  reported   figures,  peacekeeper  sex  with  underage  females  is  widespread,  particularly  in  the  context  of   displacement  due  to  conflict.  This  persists  despite  these  acts  being  both  against  the  UN's  rules,  and   constituting  criminal  actions  in  most  jurisdictions.     Of  course,  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  is  also  committed  by  humanitarian  aid  workers  and  other   international  actors,  albeit  no  central  statistics  are  logged  that  would  enable  research  on  that  area.   It  is  crucial,  however,  first  to  focus  on  UN  peacekeepers  before  seeking  to  address  the  related  issue   of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  committed  by  other  international  actors.  The  international

   community  expressly  mandates  peacekeepers  to  protect  civilians;  and  yet,  they  have  long  been   notorious  consumers  of  illegal  sex:   Peacekeepers  are  reportedly  among  the  highest  paying  customers  for  sex  with  children.   They  pay  from  US  $5  to  $300.  Some  peacekeepers  are  alleged  to  pool  money  to  obtain  a  girl   and  then  all  have  sex  with  the  same  child.23   Moreover,  it  may  well  be  that  rolling  out  "complaint  reception  mechanisms"  to  the  community  level   does  not  enhance  criminal  accountability  and  access  to  justice  for  victims  for  a  number  of  reasons.24   Depending  on  how  the  process  is  designed,  having  local  civil  society  organizations  receive   complaints  -  rather  than  victims  reporting  directly  to  independent,  impartial  and  trained  law   enforcement  structures,  whether  local  or  international  -  could  compromise  this  crucial  first  step  of   a  potential  criminal  process.  Furthermore,  this  arrangement  may  perpetuate  the  serious  conflict  of   interest  associated  with  the  UN's  involvement  in  receiving,  handling  and  responding  to  allegations   of  crimes  of  sexual  abuse  by  its  own  personnel.  Even  if  community-based  complaint  reception   structures  are  designed  to  be  arms-length  from  the  UN,  the  UN  would  presumably  oversee  and   direct  them,  and  victims  may  not  see  them  as  impartial  or  independent.  These  concerns  coupled   with  the  lack  of  transparency  around  these  structures  point  to  the  need  for  further  research  into   their  design,  including  incorporating  the  perspectives  of  community  leaders  that  support  victims  or   potential  victims.    

A  research  proposal  to  address  the  problem  
The  key  problem  that  this  MRP  seeks  to  address  is:     How  can  advocates  better  understand  and  expose  the  significant  barriers  to,  and  challenges   associated  with,  the  UN's  reporting  structures  for  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and   abuse  by  peacekeepers,  particularly  in  the  context  of  displacement,  from  the  perspectives  of   community  leaders  that  support  victims,  in  order  to  consider  and  propose  appropriate   reforms?     The  research  project  proposed  as  a  method  for  addressing  this  problem  is  an  independent,   qualitative  field  study  to  elicit  the  perspectives  of  local  civil  society  organization  leaders  and   community  members  entrusted  with  the  care  and  support  of  victims  (or  potential  victims)  of  sexual

2.  BACKGROUND  CONTEXT  AND  PROPOSED  RESEARCH  PROJECT  
There  is  no  child  more  vulnerable  in  the  world  today  than  a  child  internally  displaced  by   armed  conflict,  forced  to  leave  home  and  community  behind.  Not  only  do  they  fear  for  their   lives  when  they  flee  for  safety,  but  often  face  discrimination  as  their  families  search  for   means  of  survival.  They...  are  frequently  sexually  assaulted  or  otherwise  abused  by   unscrupulous  adults,  sometimes  even  by  the  aid  workers  or  peacekeepers  sent  to  protect   them.25  

The  current  context  
After  the  UN's  inaction  regarding  child  sex  abuse  by  international  peacekeepers  in  CAR  was  first   exposed  in  2015,  human  rights  organizations  and  the  media  increased  their  focus  on  the  problem,   and  brought  to  light  new  instances  of  child  sex  abuse  in  that  country.26  This  is  largely  because  NGO   staff  and  journalists,  including  investigative  reporters,  were  dispatched  to  CAR  following  the  initial   exposÃ©  by  the  Code  Blue  campaign.  In  addition,  victims  of  sexual  abuse  likely  felt  that  reporting  was   less  futile  than  in  the  past,  since  they  could  see  the  outside  world  and  the  UN  taking  seriously  their   reports  of  peacekeeper  abuse,  and  were  therefore  more  inclined  to  report  past  or  new  incidents.   While  there  were  no  reported  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  or  abuse  in  CAR  in  2014,27  after   AIDS-Free  World's  exposÃ©  in  mid-2015,  17  allegations  were  reported  by  October  2015,  with  a  total   of  22  allegations  reported  in  2015,  and  at  least  29  further  allegations  reported  by  20  April  2016.28     The  public  outcry  about  the  scandal  in  CAR  led  the  UN  to  appoint  Canadian  Justice  Marie   Deschamps  in  June  2015  to  head  an  external  independent  review  into  the  UN's  response  to  those   allegations,  as  well  as  broader  systemic  issues  about  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by   peacekeepers.  Recognizing  the  particular  vulnerability  of  displaced  children,  the  independent

Overview  of  the  proposed  research  project    
In  light  of  these  reflections,  this  paper  proposes  that  the  Code  Blue  campaign  commissions  and   coordinates  original  research  on  the  reporting  context  for  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and   abuse  by  UN  peacekeeping  personnel.  I  propose  that  the  research  focuses  on  CAR  and  other   comparable  countries  hosting  peacekeeping  missions  where  there  are  large  internally  displaced   populations.  The  research  will  enable  a  systemic  analysis  of  the  barriers  to,  and  challenges   associated  with,  formal  reporting.

The  proposed  project  consists  of  primary  research  in  camps  for  internally  displaced  persons  ("IDP   camps").  The  focus  will  be  on  the  perceptions  of  local  civil  society  organizations  and  other   community  leaders.  The  research  participants  will  ideally  be  those  who  are  in  positions  of   responsibility  for  providing  support  to  victims  of  peacekeeper  sexual  abuse,  or  to  vulnerable   populations  who  are  potential  victims.  Specifically,  the  research  will  obtain  insights  into   considerations  of  decisions  around  formal  reporting,  as  well  as  experiences  and  outcomes  when   formal  reports  have  been  made.  For  example,  the  research  will  explore  the  research  participants'   role  in,  and  experiences  of,  helping  victims  to  formally  report,  whether  to  the  UN,  designated   community  structures,  or  local  authorities.  In  terms  of  the  design,  researchers  will  conduct  focus   groups  to  better  understand  the  context  and  determine  the  most  appropriate  individuals  to   interview,  followed  by  in-depth  interviews  with  selected  participants.  The  study  will  assess   whether  the  UN's  recent  outreach  efforts  and  stated  measures  to  roll-out  model  community-based   reporting  mechanisms  are  working,  and  whether  they  are  even  desirable,  from  the  perspectives  of   the  communities  themselves.  It  will  offer  insights  into  any  problems  with  the  structures  and  initial   insights  into  possible  solutions.   The  research  will  involve  working  with  local  partner  organizations  based  in  the  host  countries   (likely  CAR,  DRC  and  South  Sudan),  which  will  provide  input  into  the  study's  design,  host  focus   groups,  and  facilitate  the  involvement  of  local  researchers.  Methodological  and  additional   considerations  are  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  Section  Four.  

Research  justification  
From  the  perspective  of  victims  and  vulnerable  populations:  Greater  awareness  of,  and  attention  on,   the  issues  identified  should  cause  the  UN  (and  others  who  receive  initial  reports  of  peacekeeper   sexual  abuse)  to  critically  examine  flaws  in  the  current  reporting  structures.  It  should  also  lead  to   better  support  for  communities  and  local  civil  society  groups  that  are  involved  in  supporting   victims,  particularly  in  the  context  of  IDP  camps.  Participation  in  the  research  should  help  empower   community  leaders  to  raise  concerns  on  reporting  structures  with  local  authorities  and/or  the  UN.   In  the  longer  term,  and  accompanied  by  additional  research  and  advocacy,  this  project  should  force   decision-makers  to  implement  more  appropriate,  victim-centered  reporting  structures.  Ultimately,   these  efforts  should  improve  the  prospect  of  reported  allegations  being  more  effectively  and   efficiently  investigated,  independent  from  the  UN,  leading  to  more  successful  prosecutions.  Ideally,   complementary  measures  to  identify  risks  and  prevent  such  abuses  from  occurring  will  be  re- energized  through  this  process.

   From  a  victim-centred  advocacy  perspective:  Building  on  the  above,  the  general  public,  media,  UN   leaders  and  Member  State  decision-makers  will  likely  be  more  outraged  by  the  problem,  invest   greater  resources  to  fix  it,  and  be  more  open  to  deeper  systemic  changes41,  if  the  specific  barriers   and  challenges  that  vulnerable  populations  and  their  community  support  systems  face  in  reporting   abuses  are  better  exposed  and  understood.  The  proposed  research  also  provides  an  opportunity  for   academics  and  civil  society  to  critically  assess  the  UN's  efforts  to  roll  out  community-based   complaint  mechanisms,  and  examine  whether  they  actually  encourage  formal  reporting  and/or  lead   to  more  access  to  justice.  This  is  especially  crucial  because  the  UN's  internal  assessments  are  rarely   made  public,  as  is  the  case  with  details  of  such  new  mechanisms.   From  an  academic  perspective:  Limited  field  research  exists  on  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by   peacekeepers,  with  only  a  few  studies  examining  the  particular  vulnerability  of  displaced  persons   to  sexual  abuse  by  peacekeepers,  and/or  the  specific  barriers  to  and  challenges  associated  with   reporting,  as  the  literature  review  outlines  below.42  The  proposed  research  builds  on  a  recent  study   that  found  that  231  Haitians  involved  in  transactional  sex  did  not  know  about  the  UN  mission's   reporting  mechanism  or  hotline,  and  only  7  knew  that  the  mission  had  a  policy  on  sexual  activities   by  peacekeepers.43  It  will  be  useful  to  compare  these  findings  with  the  perspectives  of  community   leaders,  who  might  be  expected  to  be  more  familiar  with  the  UN  rules  and  procedures.  The  study   will  complement  recent  human  rights  investigations  by  groups  such  as  Human  Rights  Watch  in   CAR,  44  journalistic  expositions,  and  earlier  NGO  reports.  Researchers  seeking  to  influence  policy   recognize  that  additional  studies,  with  findings  published  in  peer-reviewed  journals,  help   strengthen  the  case  for  additional  resources  and  policy  reform  measures.

and  scholarly  context;  (ii)  considering  preliminary  research  design  and  methodological   considerations  that  will  be  addressed  with  the  research  team,  along  with  ideas  on  how  to   operationalize  the  project;  and  (iii)  setting  out  the  planned  dissemination  and  advocacy  strategy  to   ensure  that  the  research  is  applied  to  support  reform  efforts.     The  purpose  of  the  proposal  is  to  enable  AIDS-Free  World's  Code  Blue  campaign  to  consider  the  key   aspects  of  the  proposed  research  project,  which  it  will  then  ideally  implement  by  dedicating  and   marshalling  the  necessary  resources.  It  is  proposed  that  the  campaign  will  also  play  a  key  role  in   helping  to  disseminate  the  findings  as  part  of  its  ongoing  advocacy.  Nonetheless,  to  ensure  the   credibility  of  the  findings,  the  field  research  should  be  entrusted  to  independent  academics  with  the   required  experience  and  expertise  (and  drawing  on  the  support  of  trained  social  workers,  and  legal   and  other  experts,  as  needed).  The  Code  Blue  campaign  could  nonetheless  provide  support  to  both   the  execution  of  the  research  (for  instance,  by  providing  a  research  coordinator  to  support  the   project  and  by  connecting  researchers  to  local  contacts  in  peacekeeping  missions)  and  to  the   independent  academic  publication  of  the  findings  (for  instance,  by  offering  comments  on  the  draft   write-up  of  the  findings  and  discussing  the  practical  application  of  recommendations).  The   campaign's  considerable  contribution,  beyond  this,  would  be  to  undertake  the  associated  advocacy   to  expose  and  contextualize  the  results  in  ways  that  make  them  understandable  to  a  broad  public   and  ensure  they  are  acted  upon  by  decision-makers.  

The  Code  Blue  campaign's  suitability    
The  Code  Blue  campaign  has  had  previous  successes  in  supporting  the  dissemination  of  research  by   academics  and  translating  findings  for  a  wider  audience.  For  example,  when  it  first  heard  of  expert   research  commissioned  by  the  UN  (but  not  made  available  to  the  public),  it  released  the  final  report   via  an  open  letter  to  Ambassadors  to  the  UN  in  New  York.45  This  helped  establish  the  campaign's   credibility  as  a  well-connected  source  of  information  and  as  an  advocate  for  greater  transparency   on  the  problem,  and  disseminated  the  expert's  findings  more  broadly.   The  Code  Blue  campaign  is  run  by  small  core  team  of  staff  from  AIDS-Free  World,  led  by  co- Directors  Paula  Donovan  and  Stephen  Lewis,  who  have  extensive  experience  as  former  senior  UN   officials,  and  are  respected  expert  advocates  on  sexual  violence  and  UN  reform.  The  campaign  is   well-connected  to  a  broad  network  of  academics,  journalists,  advocates,  legal  experts  and  UN

The  following  section  outlines  several  key  concepts  and  definitions,  drawing  on  the  UN's  official   terminology,  as  well  as  analysis  Â­  by  the  Code  Blue  campaign  and  other  experts  -  of  some  of  the   shortcomings  of  those  definitions.    This  background  is  crucial  for  understanding  the  context  of  the   research  and  ensuring  that  it  is  situated  within  current  academic,  policy  and  NGO  literature  and   work.   Sexual  exploitation  and  abuse:  Sometimes  referred  to  by  its  acronym,  SEA,  this  is  the  UN's   terminology  for  prohibited  sexual  behaviour  targeting  the  local  population  by  UN  and  associated   personnel.  There  is  some  debate  as  to  whether  it  can  also  refer  to  acts  committed  by  a  UN  staff   member  against  another  UN  staff  member.  For  the  purposes  of  the  paper,  the  former  definition   suffices.  I  have  selected  not  to  use  the  acronym,  and  often  use  the  term  `sexual  violence'  instead,   following  Lutz  et  al.'s  excellent  characterization:     The  shorthand  (SEA,  pronounced  S,  E,  A)  is  widely  used,  but  both  the  long  and  the  short   hand  term  have  the  problem  that  they  fail  to  communicate  anything  like  the  reality  and   severity  of  much  of  what  goes  by  that  name  or  acronym,  such  as  an  adult  male  peacekeeper   sodomizing  an  11  year  old  girl,  already  orphaned  and  impoverished  by  war;  coercing  sex  by   offering  money  or  food  to  hungry  teenage  girls  for  oral  sex;  paying  boys  to  act  as  pimps;   verbal  sexual  abuse,  or  having  a  sexual  relationship  with  a  young  woman  who  hopes   thereby  to  escape  her  situation  but  is  abandoned  when  the  peacekeeper  leaves.46   Sexual  abuse:  The  SG's  Bulletin  defines  sexual  abuse  as  "the  actual  or  threatened  physical  intrusion   of  a  sexual  nature,  whether  by  force  or  under  unequal  or  coercive  conditions."47  All  sexual  activity   with  minors,  including  sexual  exploitation,  is  sexual  abuse.   Sexual  exploitation:  The  SG's  Bulletin  defines  sexual  exploitation  as  "any  actual  or  attempted  abuse   of  a  position  of  vulnerability,  differential  power,  or  trust,  for  sexual  purposes,  including,  but  not   limited  to,  profiting  monetarily,  socially  or  politically  from  the  sexual  exploitation  of  another."48

   Host  country:  A  country  hosting  a  peacekeeping  mission,  also  referred  to  as  the  local  country  or  the   research  location  in  this  paper.   Beneficiaries  of  assistance:  The  SG's  Bulletin  "strongly  discourages,"  but  does  not  prohibit,  sexual   relations  with  "beneficiaries  of  assistance."49  In  peacekeeping  contexts,  beneficiaries  are  generally   understood  to  mean  all  nationals  of  the  host  country  as  well  as  refugees  residing  there.  As  this  term   is  not  defined  in  the  UN  Bulletin,  it  can  be  a  source  of  confusion.   Allegations:  According  to  the  UN's  CDU,  which  tracks  and  records  allegations  in  UN  peacekeeping:   An  allegation  is  an  unproven  report  of  alleged  misconduct,  which  may  not  necessarily  lead   to  an  investigation  if  there  is  insufficient  information  to  warrant  an  investigation.   Allegations  are  counted  per  individual,  unless  the  number  and/or  identities  of  individuals   have  not  been  confirmed.  In  that  case,  allegations  would  be  counted  per  incident."50     As  noted  above,  it  is  common  that  one  "allegation"  includes  several  incidents,  or  one  incident   involving  multiple  perpetrators  and/or  multiple  victims.  The  CDU's  website  lists  only  allegations  of   sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by  UN  peacekeeping  personnel,  while  the  SG's  annual  Special   Measures  report  also  includes  allegations  by  other  UN  personnel  not  supported  by  the   peacekeeping  structure.  However,  it  appears  that  not  all  of  the  UN's  funds,  programmes  and   agencies  are  covered  by  that  report.   Minors:  "Article  1  of  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  of  1989,  defines  a  child  as  every   human  being  below  the  age  of  18  years  unless,  under  the  law  applicable  to  the  child,  majority  is   attained  earlier.  The  same  definition  is  used  in  article  2  of  the  African  Charter  on  the  Rights  and   Welfare  of  the  Child,  of  1999."51     Countries  have  different  laws  in  terms  of  the  age  of  consent  for  sexual  activity  and  for  reporting   child  sex  abuse.  For  instance,  while  Canada's  laws  define  minors  as  all  those  under  the  age  of  18,   Canada's  official  age  of  consent,  under  its  criminal  laws,  is  16.  Sexual  activity  involving  16-  and  17- year  olds  is  illegal  if  it  includes  activity  considered  "exploitative"  (e.g.  with  persons  in  positions  of

authority  or  trust)  or  involving  prostitution  or  pornography.52  Moreover,  in  Canada  there  are  laws   on  mandatory  reporting  to  child  protection  officials  for  suspected  child  sex  abuse,  determined  on  a   provincial  or  territorial  level.   As  Lutz  et  al.  point  out,  "The  legality  of  prostitution,  the  age  of  consent  and  the  age  of   marriageability  all  vary  around  the  world."53Nonetheless,  section  3.2(b)  of  the  SG's  Bulletin  clarifies   that  all  those  under  18  are  considered  minors  with  regards  to  its  policy  on  sexual  exploitation  and   abuse,  regardless  of  local  laws,  making  such  acts  against  the  UN's  administrative  rules  (and  subject   to  administrative  sanctions)  at  a  minimum:  "Sexual  activity  with  children  (persons  under  the  age  of   18)  is  prohibited  regardless  of  the  age  of  majority  or  age  of  consent  locally.  Mistaken  belief  in  the   age  of  a  child  is  not  a  defence."54  Even  in  conflict  situations  where  local  laws  and  child  protection   structures  may  be  weak,  damaged  or  non-existent,  the  UN  should  uphold  and  model  the  highest   standards.   Transactional  sex:  Although  not  explicitly  labelled  as  such  in  the  SG's  Bulletin,  section  3.2(c)  outlines   the  UN's  definition:  an  "exchange  of  money,  employment,  goods  or  services  for  sex,  including  sexual   favours  or  other  forms  of  humiliating,  degrading  or  exploitative  behaviour,  [which]  is  prohibited.   This  includes  any  exchange  of  assistance  that  is  due  to  beneficiaries  of  assistance."55  One  study   notes,  in  discussing  "selling  sex,"  that  "the  term  `transactional  sex'  is  also  used  for  this  form  of   having  sex  for  money,  etc.,  but  both  terms  are  problematic  as  they  suggest  a  situation  of  equal   exchange,  which  is  certainly  not  the  case  for  children,  and  not  for  many  women."56   While  "exploitation"  is  sometimes  used  to  describe  transactional  sexual  relationships  between   peacekeepers  and  minors,  if  they  are  below  the  age  of  consent  to  sexual  relations,  this  should  be   properly  referred  to  as  sexual  abuse.  This  has  important  implications  for  correctly  characterizing   and  investigating  all  sexual  acts  with  those  below  the  age  of  consent  as  being  likely  criminal   conduct.

   Peacekeeping:  The  terms  peace  operations  and  peacekeeping  missions  are  used  interchangeably  in   this  paper.  Current  peacekeeping  operations  now  often  include  mandates  that  make  them   operationally  war-like,  when  there  is  no  `peace'  to  keep.  This  research  project  deals  specifically   with  the  16  peacekeeping  operations  currently  led  by  the  UN,  nine  of  which  are  in  Africa.57     Peacekeepers:  For  this  project,  the  term  "peacekeepers"  encompasses  both  uniformed  and  civilian   personnel  involved  in  peacekeeping  missions,  also  referred  to  as  "UN  peacekeeping  personnel."  In   terms  of  reporting  on  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse,  the  CDU  website  lists  five   categories:  military;  police,  civilian;  other  (consultants  and  contractors);  and  unknown.58  The   jurisdictional  considerations  associated  with  the  different  categories  of  personnel  are  discussed   below.59  While  some  studies  look  only  at  sexual  abuses  by  military  or  uniformed  personnel,  the   Code  Blue  campaign  has  uncovered  that,  as  a  proportion  of  personnel  on  mission,  the  number  of   accusations  against  civilian  personnel  is  greater  on  average  than  for  military  personnel  since   2007.60     Jurisdictional  considerations:  The  current  structures  and  rules  governing  sexual  abuse  by   peacekeepers  pose  an  inherent  challenge:  the  onus  is  largely  on  the  victim  to  identify  the  category   of  personnel  of  the  accused,  if  there  are  no  other  witnesses,  as  different  investigative  and  criminal   processes  and  authorities  apply  to  different  categories  of  personnel.  Troop-contributing  countries   (TCCs)  have  exclusive  criminal  jurisdiction  over  their  respective  military  personnel,  meaning  such   troops  are  immune  from  local  (host  state)  jurisdiction.  However,  if  the  accused  is  a  civilian  or  police   personnel,  the  UN  appears  to  reserve  the  right  to  decide  whether  their  immunity  from  local   prosecution  (which  is  "functional"  in  nature,  thus  only  applying  to  acts  committed  in  their  official   capacity)  should  be  deemed  not  to  apply.  If  immunity  is  found  not  to  apply,  the  UN  then  informs   local  (host  state)  authorities  of  the  alleged  crime  Â­  in  the  case  of  the  study,  the  authorities  in  CAR,

DRC  or  South  Sudan.61  Yet,  UN  police  personnel  are  often  repatriated  well  before  the  host  country   has  been  appraised  of  the  crime.  Moreover,  the  sending  country  (e.g.,  the  country  of  the  repatriated   police  officer)  may  not  have  extraterritorial  jurisdiction  for  certain  crimes  committed  abroad,  and   transnational  investigations  are  inherently  more  challenging.   This  confusing  jurisdictional  arrangement  poses  a  fundamental  double  standard:  different  rules   apply  to  different  categories  of  personnel.  There  is  an  extra  burden  placed  on  victims  for  correctly   identifying  the  accused,  in  order  to  trigger  an  appropriate  investigation  by  the  country  of   nationality  of  the  alleged  perpetrator  or  the  host  state,  depending  on  the  category  of  personnel,  if   justice  is  to  be  served.   Refugees:  Refugees  are  individuals  who  have  crossed  an  international  border  in  search  of   protection.  Legally,  they  are  guaranteed  international  protection  under  the  1951  Refugee   Convention.  "Refugees"  technically  refers  to  only  those  who  have  been  granted  status  under  the   Convention  on  a  recognized  ground;  in  this  paper,  I  include  asylum  seekers  as  part  of  the  broader   category.   IDPs:  Internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  have  left  their  homes  due  to  conflict  or  natural  disaster,   similar  to  refugees,  but  have  not  crossed  an  international  border.  Legally,  their  governments  are   responsible  for  their  protection,  as  is  outlined  in  greater  detail  below.  

Guidelines  
Displaced  persons,  especially  children,  are  amongst  the  most  vulnerable  to  peacekeeper  sexual   abuse.    Given  this,  the  following  section  expands  on  the  definitions  above  by  reviewing  guidelines,   policies  and  laws  that  cover  displacement  and  child  protection,  and  those  that  address  the  tension   between  maintaining  confidentiality  for  research  participants  and  mandatory  reporting  laws  and   guidelines  relating  to  suspected  child  sex  abuse.  It  also  draws  on  the  research  methods  and   practices  identified  in  the  key  relevant  studies.   Institutional  and  international  protection  of  refugee  and  internally  displaced  children   A  core  set  of  documents  codify  international  human  rights,  humanitarian  and  refugee  law  as  it   relates  to  displaced  children,  most  of  which  have  widespread  acceptance  and  therefore  can  be  said   to  represent  customary  international  law.                                                                                                                                 
61  To  do  this,  the  UN  conducts  a  preliminary  "investigation"  to  determine  whether  the  allegation  is  "credible."  

This  is  problematic,  as  it  has  no  legal  jurisdiction  over  the  crimes,  and  does  not  make  clear  the  standard  of   proof  used  to  determine  credibility.   21  

  

  

   Refugee  children:  As  noted  in  the  definitions  section,  refugees  are  guaranteed  rights  through  the   1951  Refugee  Convention,  which  states  hosting  refugees  are  bound  to  uphold.  In  the  African   context,  there  is  broader  legal  protection  under  the  1969  Convention  Governing  the  Specific  Aspects   of  Refugee  Problems  in  Africa,  interpreted  as  more  accommodating  of  mass  refugee  situations.   Globally,  the  1989  Convention  of  the  Rights  of  the  Child  contains  specific  articles  relating  to  the   protection  of  refugee  children.  In  1993,  UNHCR  adopted  its  Policy  on  Refugee  Children,  followed  by   its  Guidelines  on  Protection  and  Care  the  year  after.62  As  noted  above,  UNHCR  followed  this  with   complementary  guidance  on  Sexual  Violence  Against  Refugees  in  1995.     Internally  displaced  children:  In  the  international  context,  states  are  obligated  under  international   human  rights  law  to  uphold  the  rights  of  all  citizens  and  permanent  residents,  including  those   displaced  within  their  borders.  In  situations  of  armed  conflict,  international  humanitarian  law   applies  as  well.  The  protections  found  in  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  apply  as  well,  and   generally  supersede  all  national  law.  Further,  in  the  African  context,  the  1999  African  Charter  on  the   Rights  and  Welfare  of  the  Child  applies.  In  situations  of  mass  displacement  due  to  conflict  or  other   emergency  situations,  including  those  where  peacekeepers  are  dispatched,  the  UN  has  a  protection   mandate:  UNHCR  is  responsible  for  protection  of  IDPs  generally,  and  UNICEF  has  a  specific  duty  for   the  protection  of  children.63     Tension  between  confidentiality  and  child  protection   As  has  been  referenced  above,  an  important  consideration  for  the  proposed  research  project  is  the   tension  between  maintaining  confidentiality  of  all  information  provided  by  research  participants,   and  obligations,  in  accordance  with  national  laws  and  ethical  standards,  relating  to  mandatory   disclosure  of  child  sex  abuse  to  identified  child  protection  authorities.  In  practice,  where   applicable,  this  means  that  any  research  participants  whose  confidentiality  cannot  be  guaranteed   by  researchers  with  regards  to  the  relevant  authorities  because  of  mandatory  disclosure  laws  must   be  informed  about  this  through  the  consent  process.  My  assessment,  as  outlined  below,  is  that  these   issues  are  not  sufficiently  explored  in  the  academic  literature  or  in  NGO  reports  that  relate  to  the

subject  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  in  peacekeeping  contexts,  which  present  additional   challenges  and  complexities.  64   A  general  principle  is  that  parental/guardian  consent  is  required  for  research.  Older  youth  may  be   exempt  from  this  requirement,  particularly  for  research  regarding  sexual  activity  if  national  laws   set  the  age  of  sexual  consent  below  18.  In  addition,  in  some  jurisdictions  mandatory  reporting  of   child  sex  abuse  only  applies  to  children  below  a  certain  age.  Most  UN  operational  guidance   addresses  these  concepts,  as  they  relate  to  children  in  conflict  and/or  displacement  situations,  in   rather  general  terms.65  The  SG's  2003  Bulletin  defines  specific  obligations  for  UN  personnel  to   report  allegations  "via  established  reporting  mechanisms,"  and  prohibits  all  sexual  activity  with   children  under  18  regardless  of  local  laws  (with  an  exception  for  `legal'  marriages),  but  does  not   specifically  address  reporting  to  host  country  child  protection  authorities.66  Given  the  UN's  critical   role  in  strengthening  and/or  rebuilding  host  country  capacity  as  part  of  peacekeeping  efforts,   including  in  terms  of  the  rule  of  law,  this  is  a  major  omission.   The  relevant  studies  that  relate  to  research  with  children  (which  are  discussed  in  greater  detail  in   the  next  section)  do  not  generally  explain  the  specific  methodology  and  protocols  used  for   considering  or  handling  this  balance  between  maintaining  confidentiality  for  child  participants  and   any  requirements  to  report  abuse  uncovered  for  the  first  time.  For  example,  CsÃ¡ky's  2008  study   notes  (p.  3)  that  participants  were  advised  that  disclosure  of  abuse  would  not  be  acted  on  without   permission  of  the  individual,  though  notes  its  'Safeguarding  Children'  policy  that  mandates   reporting,  prioritising  the  best  interests  of  the  child  (p.  12).67  A  2006  Save  the  Children  report,   which  organized  focus  groups  and  interviews  with  adults  and  children  under  the  context  of  income- generating  activities,  does  not  discuss  the  confidentiality  /  reporting  issue,  but  does  note  in  its   recommendations  that  international  NGOs  should  report  all  cases  to  the  "relevant  government   authority."68  The  original  2002  UNHCR/Save  the  Children  report  on  refugees  in  West  Africa

   likewise  does  not  discuss  its  specific  methodology  on  this  issue.69  The  subsequent  OIOS-led   investigation  in  2002  notes  assurances  were  provided  on  the  confidentiality  of  the  information   received  (para.  7),  and  that  some  cases  were  referred  to  the  NGOs  involved  for  follow-up  (e.g.  paras.   17,  19).  70  Finally,  Atwood  et  al.'s  2011  study  does  not  discuss  any  considerations  or  protocols  for   mandatory  reporting  of  child  sex  abuse,  and  notes  the  results  were  confidential.  It  nonetheless   obtained  ethics  board  approval  from  universities  in  both  the  US  and  Liberia,  where  the  study  was   conducted,  considered  a  best  practice  for  my  proposed  research  project.71       Other  studies  appear  to  circumvent  this  concern  by  involving  only  adult  research  participants.72   Reports  by  Human  Rights  Watch  on  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by  peacekeepers  appear  to  have   interviewed  women  and  girls  whose  abuse  had  likely  already  been  reported,  or  the  NGO  took  it   upon  themselves  to  report  abuses  to  the  UN  (perhaps  seeing  the  UN  as  the  de  facto  authority  for   child  protection,  although  this  could  be  considered  problematic  from  a  capacity-building   perspective).73     The  discussion  above  informs  my  decision  to  not  involve  minors  in  the  proposed  research,  and  to   interview  community  leaders  rather  than  victims  themselves.  A  protocol  will  be  put  in  place  in   terms  of  steps  to  take  and  support  to  be  provided  in  the  event  that  new  allegations  are  uncovered   through  the  proposed  research,  as  is  described  in  Section  4.  

Theoretical  framework  
The  "boys  will  be  boys"  attitude  will  continue  to  taint  the  debate  until  approaches  to  sexual   exploitation  are  changed  to  reflect  the  fact  that  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  is  a  problem   of  misuse  of  power  and  infractions  meriting  disciplinary  action  rather  than  a  matter  of   consensual  sexual  relations  between  equal  partners.74

Lutz  et  al.  observe  that  UN  peacekeeping  officials,  and  some  UN  Member  States,  often  see  sexual   exploitation  and  abuse  as  an  issue  of  "indiscipline,"  and  as  a  function  of  unchecked  male  human   nature  and  sexual  desires  that  can  be  contained  and  limited  (including  by  such  measures  as   "appropriate"  recreational  facilities  for  peacekeepers),  rather  than  of  skewed  gender  dynamics.   This  paper  views  rape  as  "a  function  of  power,  domination  and  gender  inequality,"75  which  is   consistent  with  the  majority  of  NGO  reports  and  academic  studies  on  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse   by  aid  workers  and  peacekeepers,  including  in  the  context  of  displacement.  Undoubtedly,  "UN   peacekeeping  missions...  impact  unevenly  on  civilian  populations  in  post-conflict  environments,   especially  in  relation  to  gender  and  security,"76  in  part  due  to  gendered  power  differentials.  This   can  include  the  negative  "unintended  consequences"  of  peacekeeping,  such  as  sexual  exploitation   and  abuse.77  While  reaffirming  the  accused's  rights  to  justice,  this  proposal  is  rooted  in  a  victim- centred  approach  that  recognizes  that  concern  for  victims  has  long  been  more  rhetoric  than  reality:   the  UN-commissioned  Expert  Team  expressed  concern  about  a  "culture  of  extreme  caution  with   respect  to  the  rights  of  the  accused,  and  little  accorded  to  the  rights  of  the  victim."78   Further,  this  paper  holds  that  sexual  violence  by  peacekeepers  -  including  the  rape  of  male  children,   who  are  often  feminized  in  such  abuses79  -  is  influenced  by  the  hyper-masculine,  militarized  culture   of  peacekeeping  in  war  zones.80  Indeed,  there  is  an  inherent  conflict:     Given  military  peacekeepers  earlier  socialization  into  the  hyper-masculine  military,  what  is   required  of  peacekeepers  in  the  field  may  be  fraught  with  tension...  For  example,   peacekeeping  operations  are  argued  to  require  impartiality,  sensitivity  and  empathy,   attributes  that  may  have  been  discouraged  by  traditional  military  training.81   This  culture  is  often  unchecked  due  to  a  culture  of  impunity  resulting  from  an  absence  of  law  and   order,  both  in  the  host  country  and,  more  importantly,  in  the  flawed  design  of  UN  peacekeeping

   accountability  structures,  which  fail  to  ensure  institutional  or  individual  criminal  responsibility.  It   is  also  entrenched  through  the  culture  of  silence  common  to  tight-knit  militaries.82     To  address  the  latter,  enhanced  training  of  peacekeepers  on  gender  "issues"  and  sexual  exploitation   and  abuse,  and  an  increase  in  the  number  of  female  peacekeepers,  is  sometimes  argued  as   necessary.83  Yet,  neither  of  these  measures  will  be  sufficient  if  criminal  accountability  systems   cannot  work.  In  line  with  the  deterrence  theory  of  criminality,  this  paper  holds  that  the  prosecution   of  crimes  of  sexual  violence  will  serve  as  the  best  deterrent  to  future  crimes,84  as  it  will  help  dispel   belief  in  impunity.  Going  further,  feminist  legal  perspectives  challenge  conventional  legal  notions  of   "objectivity  and  impartiality"  and  instead  "insist  on  the  importance  of  gender  relations  as  a   category  of  analysis."85  Aligning  with  feminist  advocates  that  seek  greater  accountability  for   individual  perpetrators  of  crimes  of  sexual  abuse  in  the  international  context,  it  recognizes  that   flawed  institutional  structures  and  failures  of  leadership  contribute  to  impunity  -  without  forming   an  excuse  for  inaction.  Indeed,  advocates  can  play  a  key  role  in  re-assessing  and  challenging  these   systems  from  a  gender  perspective,  to  make  them  more  effective  for  victims  of  sexual  violence  who   seek  justice.   The  global  women,  peace  and  security  agenda  can  serve  as  a  useful  framework  for  insisting  on  a   gendered  analysis  of  sexual  violence  in  conflict  settings.  In  particular,  the  agenda  can  help  draw   attention  to  the  increased  vulnerability  of  girls  and  women  displaced  by  conflict,  and  provide  a   reference  point  to  connect  advocates  seeking  gender-sensitive  reform.  Focusing  on  the  gender   dimensions  of  (in)security,  including  the  roles  played  by  mostly  male  peacekeepers  in  conflict  and   post-conflict  zones,86  broadens  consideration  of  the  multiple  facets  of  the  problem.  It  helps  shed   light  on  how  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  destroys  the  effectiveness  of  peacekeeping  operations   and,  more  broadly,  damages  the  UN's  credibility,  including  its  credibility  on  addressing  sexual   violence  in  conflict.  Yet,  the  paper  takes  a  holistic  view  of  sexual  violence  as  a  manifestation  of   gendered  power  dynamics,  resulting  from  patriarchal  structures  that  result  in  women's  unequal

   Relevant  studies     A  key  recent  study  is  Kolbe's  qualitative  study  of  transactional  sex  with  peacekeepers  in  Haiti   (2015),  which  was  commissioned  by  OIOS.  Notably,  it  excludes  children,  although  some  adult   participants  reported  on  incidents  that  occurred  when  they  were  minors.  It  is  particularly  relevant   as  it  was  undertaken  at  the  request  of  OIOS,  which  provided  funding  and  input  into  its  design,  yet   the  academic  findings  were  independently  published  after  OIOS  had  released  a  summary  of  the   results  for  its  own  evaluation  report.  A  similar  structure  between  the  research  team  and  the  Code   Blue  campaign  is  envisaged  for  my  proposed  research  project.  Furthermore,  Kolbe's  study  shows   how  academic  research  can  support  advocacy  efforts:  the  study  uncovered  231  Haitians  who   "admitted"  to  transactional  sex  with  peacekeepers,  causing  OIOS  to  note  that  "each  instance  of   transactional  sex  would  classify  as  prohibited  conduct  under  the  2003  bulletin,  thus  demonstrating   significant  underreporting"  by  the  UN's  official  figures.89  This  received  significant  media  coverage,   leading  to  an  outcry  at  the  UN,  particularly  in  the  influential  budget  (fifth)  committee.     The  study  specifically  sought  to  "provide  feedback  on  the  process  of  reporting  abuse  and/or   exploitation  by  peacekeepers  to  the  authorities,  including  feedback  on  decision-making  by  victims   and  their  families  involved  in  this  process  as  well  as  aspects  which  may  help  or  hinder  reporting,"  a   theme  likewise  featured  in  my  proposed  research  project.90  Moreover,  it  found  that  of  the  231   research  participants  interviewed,   few  knew  of  any  policy  prohibiting  sexual  harassment  and  none  knew  of  a  MINUSTAH   reporting  mechanism  or  of  the  MINUSTAH  hotline.  Seven  interviewees  knew  that   MINUSTAH  had  a  policy  regarding  sexual  activities  by  peacekeepers.  Of  these,  four  said  they   had  heard  that  you  could  make  a  report  to  MINUSTAH  but  that  they  believed  the  report  was   only  for  rape.  Three  other  interviewees  were  unsure  of  what  is  prohibited.  Two   interviewees  thought  there  might  be  a  policy  against  prostitution  but  were  not  positive   about  it.91   It  will  be  important  to  compare  these  perceptions  with  the  knowledge  and  understanding  of   representatives  of  civil  society  organizations  and  community  leaders  through  my  proposed  study.     They  could  be  expected  to  be  more  informed  about  the  policies  and  structures;  if  they  are  not,  the   UN's  plan  to  roll-out  community-based  complaint  reception  mechanisms  will  need  to  be  assessed   alongside  outreach  and  training  efforts.

Atwood  et  al.'s  qualitative  study  provides  insight  into  the  context  of  transactional  sex  attitudes  and   behaviours  amongst  youth  in  Liberia,  though  in  a  post-conflict  society  (unlike  CAR)  where  an   extensive  "peacekeeping  economy"  has  taken  hold.  92  The  study  is  limited  in  scale  and  does  not   focus  specifically  on  peacekeepers.  Beber  et  al.'s  quantitative  household  survey  done  in  Liberia  also   looks  at  prohibited  (but  not  necessarily  criminal)  "transactional"  relationships,  with  a  focus  on   adults  rather  than  youth.  Beber  et  al.  estimate  that  58,000  women  were  involved  in  transactional   sex  with  UN  personnel  over  a  9-year  period  ending  in  2012,  while  the  UN  only  recorded  69   allegations  from  2007-2012  in  Liberia.93  This  has  parallels  to  Kolbe's  study  that  clearly  shows  the   extent  of  under-reporting  by  the  UN,  and  participants'  general  disinterest  in  reporting  transactional   sex.94  Of  course,  given  the  financial  incentives  associated  with  transactional  relationships,  it  is  not   surprising  that  many  women  (and  children)  would  choose  not  to  report.  Some  have  argued  for  the   UN's  regulatory  focus  to  be  on  preventing,  and  addressing  impunity  for,  crimes  of  sexual  violence   by  peacekeepers,  rather  than  attempting  to  prohibit  all  sexual  relations  between  locals  and   peacekeepers,  thereby  also  emphasizing  women's  agency.95   Several  studies  address  the  specific  vulnerabilities  faced  by  displaced  children,  particularly  girls.   Human  Rights  Watch's  1999  investigation  into  Sierra  Leonean  refugees  in  Guinea  addresses  sexual   violence  risks  faced  by  refugee  girls,  but  only  refers  to  aid  workers  drawn  from  the  refugee   population  and  not  UN  staff,  international  aid  workers  or  peacekeepers.96  CsÃ¡ky's  2008  report  for   Save  the  Children  covers  both  aid  workers  and  peacekeepers  in  Southern  Sudan  (now  South   Sudan),  Cote  d'Ivoire  and  Haiti.  It  held  focus  groups  with  adults  and  children,  but  did  not  focus  on   displaced  persons;  in  fact,  it  specifically  avoided  refugee  camps  as  research  sites  (no  explanation  is   given  for  this  choice).  Nonetheless,  its  focus  group  questions  are  a  good  starting  point  for  the   proposed  research  project  (see  Appendix  1),  and  it  is  the  most  relevant  study  in  terms  of  examining   the  communities'  perceptions  with  regards  to  the  reporting  context.97  Although  it  deals  with  sexual   exploitation  and  abuse  by  aid  workers  and  not  peacekeepers,  Lattu's  account  of  interviews  with

   Are  internally  displaced  persons  more  vulnerable  than  refugees?   There  can  be  different  ways  of  looking  at  this  question,  which  is  important  as  it  helps  guide  the   choice  of  research  participants  and  locations  in  countries  where  there  are  both  high  numbers  of   IDPs  and  refugees.  The  UN's  2002  report  on  sexual  exploitation  of  refugees  in  West  Africa  notes   UNICEF's  suggestion  that  the  investigation  should  have  included  IDPs,  as  they  are  also  vulnerable  to   exploitation.  The  UNHCR/Save  the  Children-UK  assessment  that  prompted  that  report  notes  "the   level  of  sexual  violence  experienced  by  abducted  girls  and  in  IDP  situations  is  much  higher  than   those  in  refugee  camps,  especially  where  awareness  campaign  have  been  conducted  [in  refugee   camps]  as  part  of  the  sexual  and  gender-based  violence  program."126     The  humanitarian  system  that  is  designed  to  support  populations  dealing  with  conflict  or  other   emergencies  is  increasingly  providing  greater  protection  to  IDPs,  with  UNHCR  now  seeing  them  as   a  core  part  of  their  protection  mandate.127  Nonetheless,  refugees  in  many  host  countries  are  likely   to  be  better  protected  than  IDPs  given  the  guarantees  provided  by  international  refugee  law  and   the  fact  that  the  UN  is  more  directly  involved  in  their  care  and  protection.  Indeed,  from  a  legal   perspective,  IDPs  are  primarily  dependent  on  their  own  state  to  provide  protection,  even  though  it   may  be  that  the  authorities  in  power  are  hostile  to  the  ethno-religious  or  other  affiliation  of  the  IDP.   As  such,  and  given  the  more  limited  research  conducted  to  date,  the  proposed  research  project   focuses  on  the  specific  protection  concerns  of  IDPs  vis-Ã -vis  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse.     Why  might  girls  choose  to  engage  in  transactional  sex?   All  sexual  activity  with  minors  under  the  age  of  18  is  a  crime  of  sexual  abuse  in  most  jurisdictions   (or  at  least  if  it  is  exploitative  in  nature),  and  is  forbidden  under  the  UN's  rules.  However,  it  is   known  that  some  girls  chose  to  engage  in  sexual  relationships  and/or  participate  in  transactional   sex  with  peacekeepers.  While  being  clear  that  this  must  not  be  condoned  given  inherent  power   differentials  and  a  high  potential  for  sexual  violence,  understanding  the  motivation  of  some  girls  to   engage  in  transactional  sex  may  help  design  strategies  to  prevent  it  and  encourage  reporting.  It  may   also  help  in  efforts  to  provide  guidance  to  the  local  civil  society  organizations  and  community

4.  RESEARCH  PROJECT  PROPOSAL  
This  section  of  the  paper  outlines  the  proposed  research  in  greater  detail,  particularly  from  the   perspective  of  how  to  bring  the  research  proposal  to  fruition.  After  clarifying  the  proposed   organizational  structure  of  the  project,  I  will  set  out  the  various  considerations.  It  must  be  noted   that  this  section  is  written  with  the  understanding  and  expectation  that  the  academic  team   conducting  the  research  will  flesh  out  and  finesse  the  proposal  in  line  with  their  expertise  and   experience,  with  legal  counsel,  and  under  the  guidance  of  Ethics  Board  review  from  their  respective   academic  institutions(s)  and  institutions  in  the  host  countries.    

Research  project  structure  
Research  coordination:  The  research  coordinator's  role  is  to  catalyze  the  research  by:  (i)  identifying   and  approaching  potential  investigators  and  supervisory  board  members;  (ii)  identifying  the   funding  and  overseeing  the  budget,  in  conjunction  with  a  colleague  responsible  for  administrative   support;  (iii)  identifying  and  hiring  local  "fixers"  or  experts  to  help  the  research  team  understand   the  local  contexts,  to  establish  and  develop  contacts,  and  plan  the  field  visits;  (iv)  to  provide   support  to  the  publication  of  results;  and  (v)  to  serve  as  the  main  liaison  between  the  research  team   and  the  Code  Blue  campaign,  particularly  in  the  dissemination  stage  of  the  research,  which  will  be   coordinated  with  advocacy  efforts.  I  anticipate  that  I  would  serve  as  the  research  coordinator  for   this  project.   Research  team:  The  research  will  be  led  be  a  principal  investigator  with  a  co-investigator.  The   research  team  will  need  to  be  able  to  work  in  English  and  in  French,  given  the  proposed  study   locations.  The  principal  investigator  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  designing  the  study,  in  consultation   with  the  supervisory  board;  (ii)  seeking  ethics  review  and  approval;  and  (iii)  leading  the  study  in   the  field.  She/he  would  then  be  responsible  for  (iv)  reviewing  and  analysing  the  findings  and   writing  up  the  results,  with  a  view  to  writing  at  least  one  publication  for  a  peer-reviewed  journal.   The  team  may  draw  on  research  assistants  for  support.   Supervisory  board:  In  order  to  enhance  the  credibility  of  the  research  project,  and  have  trusted   experts  guiding  its  design,  implementation  and  dissemination,  the  research  coordinator  would   assemble,  in  conjunction  with  the  principal  investigator,  a  3-person  supervisory  board.  The  board   will  ideally  comprise  a  diverse  group  of  experts  including  (i)  senior  researchers  with  experience   interviewing  communities  experiencing  high  levels  of  sexual  violence,  and/or  with  significant   displaced  populations;  (ii)  UN  experts,  possibly  including  former  investigators  with  knowledge  of

   the  UN's  reporting  structures;  and  (iii)  legal  scholars  or  practitioners,  particularly  those  with   experience  in  peacekeeping  contexts,  with  criminal  law  and/or  with  sexual  violence.  This  is   anticipated  to  be  on  a  non-remunerated  basis,  although  honorariums  may  be  considered.   Host  organizations  and  local  researchers:  Local  researchers  will  conduct  the  focus  group  sessions   and  interviews,  with  oversight  provided  by  the  research  team  (in  consultation  with  the  supervisory   board).  Depending  on  the  local  context,  local  organizations  working  with  displaced  and  vulnerable   populations,  and/or  that  are  themselves  identified  by  the  UN  as  hosts  for  the  "community-based   complaint  reception  mechanisms,"  will  be  identified  to  "host"  the  focus  groups.  Researchers  will  be   drawn  from  these  local  organizations  or  their  contacts.  The  research  team  will  be  responsible  for  (i)   training  the  local  researchers,  including  on  research  ethics  (e.g.  maintaining  confidentiality  of  the   research  participants  and  findings);  (ii)  discussing  the  proposed  research  questions  with  them  and   adapting  the  questions  to  the  local  context  (based  on  the  feedback  received);  and  (iii)  providing   guidance  and  supervision  of  the  process.  Where  sufficient  capacity  exists,  the  local  researchers  will   support  the  review  and  analysis  of  the  data,  including  writing  up  notes,  coding  the  data,  and   conducting  a  preliminary  analysis.   The  Code  Blue  campaign  and  the  research  coordinator  will  play  a  lead  role  in  identifying  and   establishing  contacts,  with  the  research  team.  To  identify  prospective  partners,  a  one-  or  two-page   summary  of  the  research  project  will  be  prepared  covering  the  purpose,  objectives,  methodology,   timelines,  location,  research  team  and  other  partners,  and  dissemination  strategy.  Engaging  local   researchers  has  implications  for  privacy  and  confidentiality.  Therefore,  it  will  be  important  to   ensure  that  all  potential  partners  and  researchers  are  carefully  vetted  and  trained  to  reduce  the  risk   of  conflict  of  interest  or  potential  harm  to  the  study  participants.  Partners  must  be  in  a  position  to   gain  the  trust  of  the  participants  and  ensure  confidentiality  can  be  maintained,  and  be  sensitive  to   the  potential  for  trauma.  They  must  also  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  local  laws,  customs  and   context  to  advise  the  research  team  accordingly  and  ensure  sound  decisions  throughout  the   research  process.  The  research  coordinator  and  team  will  seek  best  practices  from  other  academic   researchers  that  have  conducted  similar  or  relevant  research  in  the  proposed  host  countries  and   communities,  as  well  as  guidelines  and  codes  of  conduct  developed  by  researchers  (and   organizations)  pursuing  similar  or  relevant  research.  The  research  coordinator  will  also  consult   contacts  at  other  international  NGOs  (for  instance,  Amnesty  International,  MÃ©decins  Sans   FrontiÃ¨res,  and  Human  Rights  Watch)  operating  in  the  host  countries  as  part  of  vetting  potential

partners.  The  research  team  will  also  need  to  determine  the  appropriate  remuneration  (financial   and/or  in-kind)  for  the  local  partner  organizations  and  researchers.   The  individual  researchers  may  be  drawn  from  the  local  host  organization,  as  appropriate,  or   recommended  by  it,  with  an  emphasis  on  individuals  who  both  know  the  local  context  and  the   situation  of  victims  and  vulnerable  populations,  and  those  seeking  to  develop  and  enhance  their   research  capacity,  to  promote  knowledge  and  skills  development.  For  example,  these  may  be   MA/PhD  candidates  or  early-stage  academics  at  local  universities,  or  researchers  at  local  civil   society  or  research  institutions,  or  other  similar  experts.   Role  of  Code  Blue  campaign:  The  Code  Blue  campaign  will  commission  the  research,  and  will  likely   provide  some  or  all  of  the  funding  for  it.  Nonetheless,  the  research  itself  will  be  independent  in   order  to  preserve  the  academic  freedom  necessary  for  a  credible,  peer-reviewed  journal  publication   of  the  results.   The  Code  Blue  campaign  will  also  provide  in-kind  resources  for  the  research  project.  For  example,  it   will  provide  the  salary  for  the  research  coordinator.  It  will  also  provide  advice  and  feedback  on  the   selection  of  the  team,  design,  methodology,  implementation  and  dissemination,  and  will  suggest   contacts  or  outside  experts  and  make  introductions  as  necessary.   The  Code  Blue  campaign's  most  significant  role,  apart  from  the  research  coordinator,  will  be  its   assistance  in  disseminating  the  research  results,  and  in  particular  translating  them  into  advocacy   messages  for  the  relevant  audiences.  For  example,  as  discussed  further  in  the  dissemination  and   advocacy  strategy  section,  it  will  issue  a  statement,  write  letters  to  appropriate  UN  and  Member   States  officials  and  decision-makers,  support  the  publication  of  video  or  infographics  explaining  the   research,  and  convene  meetings  or  workshops  for  the  research  team  to  discuss  the  findings.  

Key  study  considerations  
This  is  a  preliminary  review  of  the  key  considerations  that  will  need  to  be  closely  examined  by  the   research  team  in  conjunction  with  the  supervisory  board,  legal  experts,  and  the  ethics  review   board(s).   Consent:  As  discussed,  given  concerns  around  obtaining  the  consent  of  minors  or  their

   parents/guardians  to  participate  in  research,  145  the  proposed  study  will  not  include  minors  in  the   focus  groups  or  interviews.     Confidentiality:  In  peacekeeping  contexts,  as  in  any  study  or  investigation  on  sexual  violence,   confidentiality  is  critical,  as  UN  investigators  have  noted:   It  was  appreciated  from  the  outset  that  witnesses  might  be  reluctant  to  speak  about  sexual   exploitation  and  other  related  matters  out  of  fear  of  reprisal  or  stigmatization,  or  for   cultural  and  social  reasons.  All  witnesses  were  therefore  assured  of  the  protection  of  their   identity  and  the  confidentiality  of  the  information  provided.146   Given  that  local  researchers  will  be  conducting  the  focus  groups  and  interviews,  they  will  be  given   extensive  training  on  confidentiality  and  research  ethics  more  broadly.  The  research  team  will  sit  in   on  the  focus  groups,  and  possibly  the  interviews,  to  further  provide  guidance.   Requirements  to  report:  One  important  consideration  for  the  study  is  whether  any  mandatory   reporting  requirements  will  apply  if  child  sex  abuse  is  uncovered  through  the  course  of  the   research  study.  For  instance,  Canada's  current  Tri-Council  Policy  Statement:  Ethical  Conduct  for   Research  Involving  Humans  stipulates  that  "in  exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances,   researchers  may  be  subject  to  obligations  to  report  information  to  authorities  to  protect  the  health,   life  or  safety  of  a  participant  or  third  party,"  whether  through  ethical  codes  or  laws  (including   "those  requiring  the  reporting  of  children  in  need  of  protection.")147  The  policy  notes  that  where   there  are  "reasonably  foreseeable  disclosure  requirements,"  researchers  should  advise  participants   through  the  consent  process.148  Given  these  considerations,  the  proposed  research  project  will  not   seek  to  involve  victims  directly,  and  especially  not  victims  who  are  minors.     Nonetheless,  there  are  two  main  risks  that  the  study  must  anticipate:  (i)  that  un-reported  child  sex   abuse  will  be  discovered  through  the  focus  groups  and/or  interviews;  and  (ii)  that  the  research   participants  themselves  have  experienced  sexual  exploitation  or  abuse  that  they  have  not  reported.   These  revelations  may  emerge  owing  to  the  research  study's  support,  and/or  the  increased

attention  on  this  issue  internationally  and  locally  (which  may  make  community  leaders  feel  that   reporting  is  less  futile).  On  the  latter,  as  they  are  adults,  they  hold  the  decision  power  about   whether  to  report  or  not.  On  the  former,  as  a  general  principle  it  remains  the  responsibility  of  those   in  positions  of  care  and  supervision  of  minors  to  report  accordingly  (local  laws  and  practices  will   need  to  be  studied  further).  These  principles  will  be  made  clear  at  the  start  of  the  sessions,  and  any   research  participants  who  disclose  abuse  of  children  under  their  care  will  be  provided  with  support   on  reporting  options.   Prior  to  the  field  research  component,  these  issues  will  be  closely  discussed  with  relevant  ethics   review  boards  (at  the  host  institution  of  the  research  team,  and  in  the  host  countries).  A  protocol   with  standard  responses  will  be  developed,  in  consultation  with  local  researchers,  who  will  also  be   trained  on  the  subject.  Social  workers  will  be  on  hand  to  help  guide  research  participants  who  are   considering  reporting  (and  to  provide  any  trauma  counselling  necessary).  Furthermore,  research   participants  will  be  given  a  simple  flyer  with  details  for  the  mission's  reporting  hotline,  as  Kolbe's   study  in  Haiti  modelled.149  This  is  particularly  important  as  some  participants  may  choose  to  come   forward  to  report  abuses  in  their  community  after  the  completion  of  the  formal  study.   UN  and  non-UN  peacekeepers:  The  scandal  in  CAR  made  clear  that  abuses  by  non-UN  peacekeepers   are  not  formally  recorded  by  the  UN's  reporting  systems,  meaning  that  the  "total"  allegations   reported  in  a  given  year  reflect  only  those  against  UN  peacekeepers.  While  this  is  not  clear  from  the   UN's  public  information,  different  reporting  processes  might  be  in  place  for  abuses  by  non-UN   peacekeepers:  for  example,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  proposed  community-based  complaint   reception  mechanisms  are  designed  to  receive  reports  of  abuses  by  non-UN  peacekeepers.  This  is   an  important  avenue  to  explore  to  provide  details  about  the  processes,  and  to  inform  advocacy   strategies.    

Methodological  considerations150  
In  light  of  the  considerations  above,  which  remain  subject  to  further  research  and  consideration  by   the  research  team  and  associated  experts,  the  following  design  choices  are  envisaged.   Selection  of  research  participants:  The  aim  will  be  to  recruit  senior  personnel  of  local  civil  society   organizations  and  other  community  leaders.  Ideally,  participants  will  be  involved  in  supporting   victims  and/or  those  vulnerable  to  victimization  of  peacekeeper  sexual  violence.    This  could  include

   community  workers  responsible  for  providing  protection  to  girls,  such  as  teachers,  orphanage   workers,  and  other  child  protection  workers,  as  well  as  women's  rights  leaders  and  organizations.   They  play  a  key  role  in  advocating  for  the  rights  of  victims,  including  displaced  populations,  and  in   facilitating  the  reporting  process.  For  instance,  they  support  and  accompany  victims  who  wish  to   report  to  the  UN  or  other  authorities;  partner  with  the  UN  to  host  community-based  complaint   reception  mechanisms;  and  report  abuse  that  they  hear  about  directly  to  relevant  authorities.  As   such,  their  views  on  the  reporting  process,  new  reforms  and  any  associated  outreach  by  the  UN  are   critical.   Study  type  and  design:  For  this  qualitative  study,  the  main  method  employed  will  be  focus  groups   discussions.  Academic  and  NGO  research  generally  use  focus  groups  to  encourage  participants  to   speak  in  general  terms,  not  about  their  own  personal  experiences  of  abuse,  but  rather  about  general   trends  in  their  communities.  The  study's  focus  groups  will  be  designed  to  provide  rich  qualitative   data  on  the  perceptions  of  local  civil  society  organizations  and  community  leaders.  The  main  issues   covered  through  the  common  questions  will  include:  (i)  the  broad  context  of  formally  reporting   sexual  abuse  by  peacekeepers  to  people  in  positions  of  authority,  whether  within  the  UN  or   otherwise;  (ii)  factors  associated  with  decisions  for  choosing  to  formally  report  or  not;  (iii)  any   barriers  to,  or  challenges  associated  with,  reporting;  (iv)  the  particular  experiences  and/or   vulnerability  of  displaced  populations  in  their  communities;  and  (v)  and  other  concerns  about  the   process  or  suggested  solutions  to  address  any  concerns  (for  an  illustrative,  sample  list  of  questions,   see  Appendix  1).   Consent  forms  will  be  drafted  in  simple  language  and  local  researchers  will  explain  the  concepts   and  forms  verbally  and  visually,  as  some  participants  may  be  illiterate.  For  the  pilot  study  in  CAR,  at   least  three  focus  group  discussions  will  be  organized,  with  no  more  than  6-10  participants  per   discussion.  After  the  first  focus  group,  the  questions,  responses  and  process  will  be  assessed  and   any  necessary  changes  made  for  the  subsequent  groups.   A  limited  number  of  focus  group  participants  will  be  invited  to  participate  in  further,  in-depth   interviews  with  researchers  to  provide  more  detailed  insights.  Additional  interview  participants   will  be  recruited  first  from  the  focus  groups  and  then,  as  needed,  through  snowball  sampling  to   identify  appropriate  and  willing  participants  (inclusion  criteria  will  be  developed  by  the  research

team).  Again  drawing  on  Kolbe's151  techniques,  interviews  will  be  conducted  at  a  location  of  the   participants'  choice,  and  will  involve  at  least  two  researchers.  Interviews  will  be  semi-structured,   with  an  initial  set  of  questions  that  will  be  asked  to  all  participants,  and  a  list  of  prompts   established  to  be  employed  as  needed.   Research  approach:  The  research  team  designing  the  study  will  need  to  determine  the  extent  to   which  the  research  will  be  participatory,  or  at  least  consultative,  with  the  research  participants.   This  includes  in  terms  of  study  design,  development  of  questions,  implementation,  and  analysis  and   dissemination  of  results.  They  should  consult  with  the  supervisory  board  about  whether  to   determine  this  at  the  outset  of  the  research  design  phase,  or  further  along  in  the  process  in   consultation  with  the  selected  local  partner  organization(s)  (and  local  researchers).  The  extent  that   the  approach  can  be  participatory/consultative  will  likely  depend  on  the  capacity  of  local   researchers  to  facilitate  such  collaboration.   Selection  and  involvement  of  participants,  and  research  sites:  Incentives  will  not  be  provided  to   participants,  however  reimbursement  for  any  costs  incurred  will  be  provided.  A  small  token  of   appreciation  will  be  considered  based  on  the  local  context,  and  with  ethics  review  board  approval  Â­   for  instance,  providing  a  meal  as  part  of  the  focus  group  discussions.  The  local  partner  organization   and  local  researchers  will  play  key  roles  in  determining  the  appropriateness  of  all  outreach  in  a   manner  that  does  not  harm  potential  research  participants  or  their  communities.   The  UN's  2002  study  on  sexual  exploitation  against  refugees  in  West  Africa  noted  that  "the   Investigation  Team  observed  that  some  refugees  were  more  willing  to  provide  information  outside   the  refugee  camp  environment,  owing  to  fear  of  possible  retaliation  in  the  camps."152  Again,  any   decisions  about  the  location  of  the  focus  groups  and  the  interviews  will  be  done  with  the  local   partner  organizations,  prioritizing  the  safety  and  best  interests  of  participants.   Language  and  local  context:  All  materials  and  questions  will  be  translated  into  the  appropriate  local   and  official  language(s),  and  adapted  for  the  local  context.  The  local  partner  organizations  and   researchers  will  be  responsible  for  advising  and  preparing  such  materials;  leading  the  focus  groups   and  in-depth  interviews  in  the  participants'  preferred  language(s);  and  engaging  translators  as   required.

   Selection  of  peacekeeping  missions:  As  noted  above,  the  pilot  study  will  be  in  an  IDP  camp  in  CAR.   Following  the  pilot,  the  methodology  will  be  tweaked  as  needed  and  the  teams  will  conduct   research  in  at  least  two  additional  country  contexts,  likely  South  Sudan  and  DRC.  The  researchers   would  return  to  conduct  the  research  in  at  least  one  additional  IDP  site  in  CAR,  thus  using  the   comparative  research  as  a  basis  to  inform  additional  research  in  CAR.  This  is  useful  to  provide   comparisons  based  on  the  different  contexts:   Â· CAR:  as  noted,  CAR  has  been  at  the  centre  of  the  latest  peacekeeper  sex  abuse  scandal  since   2015.  It  would  be  interesting  to  explore  why  victims  (or  their  guardians)  and  local   organizations  often  did  not  appear  to  report  abuses  when  they  occurred  prior  to  mid-2015   (the  timing  of  the  increase  in  reported  allegations  is  correlated  with  the  post-scandal  phase   and  greater  UN  and  international  attention).  Community  members  and  civil  society   organizations  Â­  both  local  and  international  NGOs  -  there  have  played  a  key  role  in   reporting  allegations  to  the  UN,  including  the  original  reports  of  child  sex  abuse  by  French   peacekeepers  involving  young  boys  in  2014.   Â· South  Sudan:  it  is  a  relatively  new  peacekeeping  mission,  similar  in  size  and  mandate  to   CAR  and  with  a  highly  vulnerable  IDP  population,  yet  there  has  been  only  one  allegation   officially  reported  to  date  (in  2016).     Â· DRC:  it  is  an  older  mission  that  still  has  a  significant  and  vulnerable  IDP  population,  and   was  at  the  centre  of  a  massive  peacekeeper  sex  abuse  scandal  in  2004-5.153  As  such,  it  would   have  seen  changes  to  whatever  complaint  reception  mechanism  was  previously  the  model   (the  other  two  missions  may  have  been  set  up  with  the  newer  community-based  model   from  the  outset).  It  has  also  witnessed  the  ebbs  and  flows  of  UN  and  international  attention   on  the  problem.   All  three  countries  have  high  levels  of  sexual  violence  in  the  general  population  and  committed  by   armed  forces  party  to  the  conflicts,  facilitating  comparisons,  particularly  on  perceptions  about  the   UN's  actions.  A  comparative  study  is  useful  as  it  allows  researchers  to  draw  out  best  (and  worst)   practices  to  inform  recommendations.  Moreover,  it  will  enable  more  credible,  systemic  findings  of   possible  barriers  to,  and  challenges  associated  with,  reporting  sexual  violence  by  peacekeepers,   thereby  facilitating  subsequent  advocacy.

If  resources  are  available,  it  may  be  fruitful  to  also  conduct  field  research  in  Liberia,  although  the   peacekeeping  mission  there  is  winding  down,  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  Liberia's  recent  laws  on   sexual  violence  are  generally  considered  victim-friendly;  (ii)  several  NGO  and  academic  studies  on   sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  were  conducted  there  over  the  past  15  years;  and  (iii)  the  country   has  historically  high  levels  of  displacement.  While  Haiti  may  also  be  considered,  it  does  not  have   such  a  significant  displaced  population.  However,  it  would  be  interesting  to  compare  findings  to   Kolbe's  2015  study  of  transactional  sex  amongst  adults,  which  was  commissioned  by  the  UN's  OIOS.   Furthermore,  it  might  be  worthwhile  to  compare  countries  with  high  levels  of  displacement  (CAR,   DRC  and  South  Sudan)  with  one  with  less  (Haiti).  Security  considerations,  which  will  be  assessed  on   a  regular  basis,  may  also  necessitate  the  study  be  carried  out  in  certain  countries  over  others.  

Further  considerations  
Risks  and  limitations,  and  mitigation  strategies:  The  Code  Blue  campaign  will  enlist  the  services  of   pro  bono  lawyers  in  its  network  to  fully  research  and  consider  the  sensitive  issues  identified  above.   It  will  ask  them  to  come  up  with  a  set  of  recommendations  and  guidance  at  the  outset  to  inform  the   study  design.  These  legal  experts  will  also  be  retained  to  provide  advice  on  any  other  legal   considerations.  A  non-exhaustive  selection  of  additional  risks  and  mitigating  strategies  is  outlined   below.   A  potential  risk,  previously  alluded  to,  is  that  it  will  be  challenging  to  identify  suitable  local   organizations  to  partner  with.  To  avoid  the  perception  of  a  conflict  of  interest,  the  local  partners   and  researchers  should  not  be  working  directly  or  indirectly  for  the  UN  or  its  funds,  programmes  or   agencies.  In  certain  contexts  this  may  be  difficult,  especially  where  the  UN  is  closely  involved  in  all   aspects  of  IDP  camp  administration.  In  these  cases,  clear  guidelines  will  be  developed  and  an   emphasis  will  be  on  finding  partners  that  are  not  directly  employed  by  the  UN  (for  instance,   contracted  by  an  international  NGO  that  is  itself  contracted  by  the  UN  or,  ideally,  other  independent   actors).  Related,  potential  partners  may  be  lacking  capacity.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  put  in  place   enhanced  guidelines,  provide  training  to  increase  the  suitability  of  potential  partners,  and  consider   non-traditional  civil  society  organizations.  If  the  above  mitigation  factors  are  not  sufficient,  the   research  team  would  partner  with  international  NGOs  who  could  engage  researchers  directly.   It  is  not  intended  that  the  research  project  be  kept  a  secret  from  the  UN,  and  it  may  be  possible  to   work  with  the  Organization  to  facilitate  this  independent  research,  particularly  if  pitched  as

   assessing  the  UN's  reforms  relating  to  new  complaint  reception  mechanisms.  Consultations  will  be   held  with  academics  who  have  worked  with  the  UN  on  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  research.154   Although  the  proposed  study  will  not  be  aiming  to  interview  any  victims  about  their  experiences,   but  rather  about  community  perceptions  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  and  the  reporting   context,  there  is  nonetheless  a  risk  of  (re-)traumatization  of  participants,  particularly  amongst   those  who  have  experienced  or  witnessed  abuse.  As  noted  above,  participants  will  be  briefed  about   the  reporting  context  and  any  participant  who  discloses  abuse,  whether  in  a  focus  group  or  in  an   interview,  will  be  reminded  of  relevant  considerations.  Care  will  be  taken  to  develop  research   questions  that  are  sensitive  to  the  local  context,  and  are  compassionate.  Social  workers  and  legal   experts  will  be  on  hand  should  any  study  participants  wish  to  consult  them;  and,  as  noted,   participants  will  be  provided  with  information  on  how  to  formally  report.  They  will  be  supported   by  the  host  organization  and  their  partners  should  they  wish  to  report,  and  the  Code  Blue  campaign   will  monitor  follow-up  accordingly.   The  potential  for  differences  of  opinion,  strategy  and  interpretation  may  arise  with  the  Code  Blue   campaign,  given  its  specific  advocacy  approach.  Examples  of  best  practices  in  civil  society-academic   partnerships  for  research  will  be  further  explored.  Building  on  this,  a  Memorandum  of   Understanding  will  be  signed  between  the  research  team  and  the  Code  Blue  campaign  to   acknowledge  the  independence  of  the  research  project  and  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all   parties,  along  with  appropriate  dispute  resolution  mechanisms.    

Research  implementation    
Timeline:  The  research  coordinator  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  the  anticipated  timeline  of   the  project,  in  consultation  with  the  relevant  parties.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  project  will  formally   begin  in  September  2016,  although  the  identification  of  the  principal  investigator,  co-investigator   and  some  supervisory  board  members  may  begin  in  advance  in  the  pre-launch  phase  (May- September  2016).  The  field  visit  portion  will  take  place  in  spring  2017.  A  preliminary  timeline  is   included  as  an  appendix  to  this  paper,  with  a  more  detailed  timeline  with  project  milestones  to  be   developed  with  the  principal  investigator  once  engaged.

Partnerships  and  funding:  The  Code  Blue  campaign,  having  recently  received  a  significant  grant,  may   be  in  a  position  to  fund  the  research  directly,  in  part  or  in  whole.  The  supervisory  board,  once   constituted,  will  review  the  modalities  of  this  funding  from  a  conflict  of  interest  perspective,  with  a   view  to  establishing  clear  guidelines  and  protocols  for  ensuring  the  independence  of  the  research,   the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  various  parties  (including  the  research  coordinator,  who  will  be   both  employed  directly  the  Code  Blue  campaign  and,  on  a  part-time  basis,  working  on  the  research   project),  and  the  information  and  communication  channels  between  the  parties.  On  initial  review,   including  to  enhance  the  credibility  of  the  study,  it  would  seem  important  to  seek  alternate  sources   of  funding  for  the  research  project  to  complement  the  Code  Blue  funding.  This  could  include   funding  from  academic  institutions,  research  councils,  or  private  public  interest  foundations.   However,  the  project  should  begin  with  Code  Blue  start-up  funding  given  the  timeliness  of  the  issue   and  the  anticipated  time  needed  to  secure  any  outside  funding.   Next  steps:  Following  the  completion  of  this  research  proposal  and  submission  as  an  MRP,  I  will  be   responsible  for  catalyzing  the  research  project  in  my  anticipated  role  as  research  coordinator,   including  for  the  pre-launch  phase.  My  first  task  will  be  to  formally  pitch  the  research  project   internally  with  the  leadership  of  the  Code  Blue  campaign,  who  have  been  consulted  at  the  outset  of   the  research  proposal  stage.  Informed  by  internal  consultations,  I  will  conduct  and/or  develop:     Â· A  mapping  of  potential  stakeholders,  including  possible  research  team  members,   supervisory  board  members,  local  partner  organizations  in  the  pilot  location,  and  funders.   Â· An  executive  summary  of  the  research  proposal  as  an  aide  to  approaching  potential   collaborators  for  the  research  team  and  supervisory  board.     Â· Further  (and  more  formal)  consultations  with  key  academics  and  NGOs  that  have  engaged   in  research  on  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse,  as  well  as  academics  in  our  network  who  have   experience  working  with  civil  society  partners  on  research,  in  consultation  with  the  Code   Blue  co-Directors.   Â· A  detailed  research  plan,  indicating  the  outstanding  research  questions  for  both  the  pre- launch  period  and  the  start  of  the  project,  including  those  that  will  require  legal  expertise.  If   Code  Blue  engages  a  Summer  Legal  Fellow  (a  first  year  law  student),  she/he  might  support   this  process  by  conducting  preliminary  research  to  guide  discussions  with  pro  bono   lawyers.

5.  DISSEMINATION  AND  ADVOCACY  STRATEGY   Dissemination  of  academic  findings  
There  will  be  an  expectation  that  the  study's  findings  will  be  analyzed,  written  up,  and  submitted   for  publication  in  appropriate  peer-reviewed  publications,  with  recommendations  developed  as   part  of  this  process.  The  research  team,  in  consultation  with  the  supervisory  board  and  the  research   coordinator,  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  other  opportunities  for  academic  engagement,   namely  workshops  with  other  academics  and  key  stakeholders,  and  presentations  at  academic   conferences  and  in  sessions  organized  by  think  tanks.  In  addition,  the  research  team  will  be  asked   to  develop  a  plan  to  share  the  findings  with  the  research  participants  and  the  host  communities.   The  Code  Blue  campaign  may  draw  on  the  research  findings,  and  bring  along  the  research  team,  in   direct  engagement  with  senior  UN  officials  and  governments,  both  in  New  York/Geneva  and  in   peacekeeping  contexts.  An  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  contextualizing  the  findings  and  discussing   the  implementation  of  recommendations.   Efforts  will  also  be  undertaken,  including  through  the  planned  Sexual  Violence  and  Peacekeeping   Network  that  I  am  establishing  with  a  colleague  at  the  University  of  Birmingham  (see  Appendix  3),   to  use  this  research  project  to  make  linkages  with  academics,  experts  and  graduate  students  who   have  conducted  previous  studies  or  are  interested  in  generating  new  research.  There  are  likely   spin-off  studies  or  opportunities  to  partner  on  this  research  project  (for  instance,  sharing  resources   and  contacts  in  host  countries).  Generating  an  updated  body  of  scholarly  research  and  literature,  in   line  with  a  renewed  interest  in  the  topic  owing  to  its  spotlight  in  the  international  media,  will  help   generate  ideas  and  momentum  for  needed  reforms.  

Advocacy  strategy  
AIDS-Free  World's  Code  Blue  campaign  will  lead  the  development  of  an  advocacy  strategy  to   accompany  the  publication  and  the  dissemination  of  the  proposed  study's  results,  and  to  determine   how  the  results  support  its  other  campaign  goals.  It  will  play  a  key  role  in  translating  the  scholarly   findings  for  a  mass  audience;  engaging  the  media;  and  pressing  key  decision-makers  for  policy   reforms  based  on  the  results.  The  results  will  be  made  public  on  its  website,  accompanied  by   relevant  fact  sheets,  infographics  or  other  materials  to  publicize  the  findings.  The  campaign  will   also  use  the  study's  results  to  demand  greater  resources  for  supporting  victims  as  part  of  UN   peacekeeping  budgets.

Follow-up  studies  and  consultations  
It  is  clear  that  this  initial  study  will  provide  a  picture  of  one  aspect  of  the  impunity  problem  for   sexual  exploitation  and  abuse:  barriers  to,  and  challenges  associated  with,  reporting.  The  findings  of   this  preliminary  research  will  ideally  inform  future  consultations,  led  by  the  Code  Blue  campaign,   on  a  better  system  for  reporting  abuses.  This  would  be  done  as  part  of  a  package  of  reforms  being   proposed  by  the  campaign  to  eliminate  the  UN's  involvement  in  receiving,  investigating  and   responding  to  allegations  of  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse,  which  the  campaign  contends   constitutes  a  conflict  of  interest.155

This  proposed  research  builds  on  earlier  field  studies,  primarily  in  Liberia,  that  examine  the   experiences  of  displaced  populations  with  regards  to  sexual  exploitation  and  abuse  by  those  sent  to   provide  assistance  and  protection.  It  will  offer  specific  insights  into  sexual  violence  by   peacekeepers,  from  the  point  of  view  of  community  leaders  and  local  organizations  that  support   victims  or  vulnerable  populations.  As  these  abuses  are  arguably  more  difficult  to  prosecute  than   sexual  violence  by  aid  workers,  given  complex  jurisdictional  arrangements  for  discipline  and   criminal  accountability,  the  research  is  particularly  relevant.  It  will  also  update  earlier  research  by   focusing  on  newer  peacekeeping  missions,  including  those  that  have  arguably  stronger  mandates  to   protect  civilians  and  respond  to  rampant  sexual  violence  within  the  host  society  and  by  armed   parties  to  the  conflicts.     The  study  will  focus  on  one  part  of  the  problem,  the  reporting  context,  with  a  view  to  assessing   current  structures  and  recent  UN  reforms  to  roll  out  "community-based  complaint  reception   mechanisms"  where  they  do  not  currently  exist.  Only  by  improving  reporting  structures  can  abuses   come  to  light,  the  full  extent  of  the  problem  be  known,  and  individual  criminal  responsibility  be   pursued  where  appropriate.  Peacekeeper  sexual  violence  threatens  missions'  very  effectiveness,  as   we  are  seeing  in  CAR,  and  is  undermining  the  UN's  role  as  an  essential  global  institution.   Responding  to  Save  the  Children's  recommendations  to  combat  under-reporting  in  2008,  a   columnist  noted  this  must  be  matched  with  measures  to  address  accountability:     If  the  U.N.  is  unable  to  properly  punish  offenders,  and  local  authorities  in  at-risk  areas  are   unwilling  to  do  so,  abusers  remain  free.  That  impunity  is  an  additional  blow  for  children   victimized  not  only  by  poverty  and  hardship,  but  in  some  cases  by  the  very  people  sent  to   protect  them.156   This  is  the  heart  of  the  Code  Blue  campaign.  Any  efforts  to  understand  the  specific  experiences  of   displaced  populations,  and  to  examine  and  strengthen  the  reporting  context  for  sexual  exploitation   and  abuse  are  necessary  Â­  but  insufficient  Â­  steps  to  end  the  vicious  cycle  and  general  culture  of   impunity  that  currently  exists  for  crimes  of  sexual  violence  by  peacekeepers.  This  academic   research,  pitched  in  partnership  with  vigorous  advocacy,  will  play  an  important  role  in  exposing   and  combatting  this  most  horrific  and  destructive  unintended  consequence  of  peacekeeping.

Appendix  3  Â­  About  the  proposed  research  coordinator  
I  am  the  project  coordinator  of  the  Code  Blue  campaign.  I  joined  AIDS-Free  World,  the  non- governmental  advocacy  organization  leading  the  campaign,  in  June  2014,  in  the  course  of  my   Master's  degree  at  Ryerson  University.  Prior  to  this,  I  served  as  research  assistant  to  Stephen  Lewis,   a  distinguished  visiting  professor  at  Ryerson  and  one  of  the  two  co-Directors  of  AIDS-Free  World.     I  am  also  on  educational  leave  from  Global  Affairs  Canada,  where  as  a  rotational  foreign  service   officer  I  have  held  roles  in  Canada  and  abroad  focusing  on  the  intersection  between  development,   human  rights  and  foreign  policy,  and  humanitarian  and  refugee  affairs,  with  a  focus  on  Africa.   Through  this  service,  I  have  experience  conducting  field-based  research  and  participating  in   consultations  in  refugee  and  IDP  camps.   I  am  also  in  the  process  of  establishing  the  Sexual  Violence  and  Peacekeeping  Network  with  Dr.  Rosa   Freedman  at  the  University  of  Birmingham  Law  School.  This  academic-civil  society  network  is   modelled  on  the  Refugee  Research  Network,  and  we  have  applied  for  UK  research  council  funding  to   launch  the  network  in  late  2016.  The  network  will  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  discuss  the   research  proposed  in  the  MRP  with  key  experts,  with  a  possible  presentation  at  the  network's   second  research  workshop,  on  Causes  and  Consequences  of  Sexual  Violence  in  Peacekeeping  (planned   for  May  2017  in  South  Africa).  It  will  also  provide  an  invaluable  network  to  identify  potential   members  of  the  research  team  and  supervisory  board,  and  a  network  for  local  contexts  in  the  three   sites  proposed  for  the  field  study.   Note:  Much  of  the  research  contained  in  this  MRP  stems  from  my  role  with  AIDS-Free  World's   Code  Blue  campaign.  The  MRP's  analysis  was  often  drawn  directly  from  the  insights  of  and  my   discussions  with  its  co-Directors  and  my  colleagues  in  the  organization,  and  our  partners   around  the  world.  For  this,  I  am  grateful.
