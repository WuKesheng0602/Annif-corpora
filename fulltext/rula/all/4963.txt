      CREATING  "COMPLETE  COMMUNITIES"  THROUGH     COMMERCIAL  LAND  USE  POLICIES        ©  Kelsey  Prentice,  2016   Master  of  Planning     In   Urban  Development   Ryerson  University        ABSTRACT  
  

   The  Ontario  government  has  provided  little  guidance  for  municipalities  regarding   planning  for  retail  development,  despite  expecting  their  land  use  policies  to  achieve  the   goals  of  sustainable  and  complete  communities  mandated  through  provincial  policies.   This  paper  examines  the  evolution  of  commercial  land  use  policy  over  the  past  twenty   years,  in  order  to  describe  how  municipalities  have  been  planning  commercial  retail   development  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Growth  Plan.  During  this  time  period,  a  new   form  of  retail  emerged  known  as  "power  retail".  This  new  form  of  retail  has  disrupted   land  use  planners'  mandate  to  maintain  the  planned  function  of  commercial  hierarchies.   Case  studies  of  three  municipalities  in  York  Region  (Vaughan,  Richmond  Hill  and   Markham)  reveal  that  commercial  land  use  policy  has  moved  away  from  creating  a   commercial  retail  hierarchy  based  on  planned  function  and  have  instead  established  an   urban  structure  based  on  a  hierarchy  of  intensification  areas.          Key  words:  commercial  planning,  suburban  intensification,  land  use  policy         iii

Introduction    
The  Ontario  government  has  provided  little  guidance  for  municipalities  regarding   planning  for  retail  development,  despite  expecting  their  land  use  policies  to  achieve  the   goals  of  sustainable  and  complete  communities  mandated  through  provincial  policies.   This  ignores  the  important  role  that  retail  development  plays  in  shaping  a  city's  urban   form,  and  how  it  relates  to  place-making  initiatives,  transportation  planning  and  a   thriving  urban  economy.        Over  the  past  20  years,  new  forms  of  retail  have  emerged  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area,   most  notably  large-format  stores  located  close  to  major  highways,  known  as  "power   retail"  (Buliung  and  Hernandez,  2009).  These  new  retail  forms  have  disrupted  land  use   planners'  mandate  to  maintain  the  planned  function  of  commercial  hierarchies.  In  the   absence  of  provincial  direction  on  retail  planning,  this  paper  will  aim  to  answer  the   question,  "How  are  urbanizing  municipalities  in  York  Region  legislating  retail   development  in  the  efforts  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Growth  Plan?".      This  question  will  be  addressed  through  a  review  of  commercial  land  use  planning  in   York  Region  between  1994  and  2015.  This  time  period  was  chosen  as  it  covers  the   decade  prior  to  the  Growth  Plan  (2006),  in  which  the  majority  of  power  retail   development  occurred  in  York  Region,  and  the  ten  years  following  the  Growth  Plan  in   which  municipalities  are  required  to  plan  for  compact,  mixed-use  and  complete   communities.  Additionally,  this  coincides  with  the  on-going  provincial  land-use  policy   review,  which  evaluates  the  effectiveness  of  provincial  land  use  plans  in  achieving  their   prescribed  goals.        Case  studies  of  three  urbanizing  municipalities  in  York  Region  (Vaughan,  Richmond  Hill   and  Markham)  reveal  that  commercial  land  use  policy  has  moved  away  from  creating  a   commercial  retail  hierarchy  based  on  a  planned  function  and  have  placed  more   emphasis  on  the  built  form  of  the  development.  Instead  of  planning  an  explicit  retail   hierarchy  based  on  planning  function,  municipalities  are  planning  a  hierarchy  of      1     

   intensification  areas.  This  coincides  with  a  greater  shift  in  the  planning  field  away  from   single-use  planning  to  mixed-use  or  "integrated"  planning.

Literature  Review  
The  Commercial  hierarchy  
The  commercial  hierarchy  concept  has  influenced  commercial  land  use  planning  over   the  past  fifty  years.  Geographers  have  described  a  typology  of  commercial   development,  while  planners  have  used  the  concept  of  a  commercial  hierarchy  to  guide   land  use  policies.        The  planning  principle  argument  for  using  planning  policy  to  protect  the  planned   function  of  an  existing  retail  use  or  centre  is  to  avoid  significant  urban  blight  and  provide   an  adequate  range  of  goods  and  services.  Planners  use  the  concept  of  "commercial   hierarchy"  to  "control  excessive  commercial  construction  and  competition"  (Hernandez   and  Simmons,  2006,  p.  467).  The  basic  argument  for  planning  retail  is  that  a  system  of   centres  arranged  in  a  hierarchy  provides  an  efficient  way  for  arranging  the  distribution,   collection  and  administration  of  goods  and  services.  This  avoids  duplication  and  waste   and  provides  social  benefits  from  economies  of  scale.  Planned  commercial   development  is  designated  to  serve  a  specific  market,  level  of  traffic  determined  by   transportation  capacity  and  this  establishes  the  market  size  and  scale  (City  of  Vaughan,   1998).        Urban  geographers  use  the  term  "retail  structure"  to  describe  the  various  retail  forms  of   an  urban  area  and  how  they  influence  and  are  impacted  by  the  global  economy,   legislation  and  cultural  change  (Jones  and  Doucet,  2001).  Existing  academic  research   on  retail  focuses  on  identifying  the  economic  and  societal  forces  that  have  contributed   to  the  emergence  of  the  current  retail  structure  and  how  it  might  develop  in  the  near   future.  Simmons  (2012)  describes  the  typologies  of  retail  through  a  case  study  of  the   retail  structure  of  Toronto.  The  different  types  of  retail  developed  over  a  sequence  of   four  stages;  traditional,  planned  shopping  centres,  power  retail,  and  the  emerging  e- commerce  market.  Each  type  of  retail  development  emerged  from  a  specific  time   period,  and  remains  a  part  of  the  existing  retail  retail  structure  of  the  city.        3     

   The  "traditional"  stage  describes  retail  strips  with  small  shops  and  independent  family   businesses.  Traditional  retail  develops  when  there  is  access  to  pedestrian  customers   and  public  transit  systems  determines  accessibility.    This  stage  was  identified  by  Berry   (1963)  and  others  interested  in  "central  place  systems",  meaning  the  relationships   between  the  quantity  and  variety  of  local  retail  and  the  population  and  income  they   serve  (Hernandez  &  Simmons,  2006).        Planned  shopping  centres  emerged  post  World  War  II,  when  years  of  prosperity  led  to   the  widespread  purchase  of  automobiles  and  suburban  growth  supported  by   investments  in  highways.  Planned  shopping  centres  absorbed  the  expansion  of  retail   activity  during  this  period.  This  retail  format  was  highly  structured,  with  planners  and   developers  establishing  a  commercial  hierarchy  based  on  the  size  of  the  site  and  the   anchor  tenant  (Simmons,  2012).        Power  retail  emerged  in  the  1990's  to  challenge  planning  policies  and  the  existing  retail   hierarchy  (Hernandez  and  Simmons,  2006).  There  are  three  elements  of  power  retail:  1)   big  box  stores  2)  the  big  box  chain  retailers  that  operate  big  box  stores  3)  planned   clusters  of  big  box  stores  known  as  power  centres  and  4)  unplanned  clusters  of  power   centres.  This  new  retail  form  began  with  the  entry  of  big  box  U.S.  retailers  into  the   Canadian  marketplace.  The  big  box  concept  consists  of  building  a  large,  but   inexpensive  store  offering  low  prices  and  ample  parking  (Builing  and  Hernandez,   2009).        

Power  Retail  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area    
The  proliferation  of  "power  retailing"  and  the  emergence  of  "power  nodes"  has   dramatically  altered  the  retail  structure  of  the  Greater  Toronto  Area,  resulting  in  land  use   patterns  that  are  incompatible  with  the  goals  and  vision  of  the  Ontario  government's   land  use  policies.  "Power  retail"  describes  a  retail  form  that  emerged  in  the  Greater   Toronto  Area  during  the  1990's  and  is  distinct  from  previous  forms  of  retail  development   (traditional  retail  strips  in  inner  cities  and  suburban  shopping  centres)  (Buliung  and   Hernandez,  2009;  Simmons,  2014).     4     

      Power  retail  is  comprised  of  three  different  concepts;  big  box  stores,  power  centres  and   power  nodes.    Big  box  stores  are  retail  outlets  that  are  generally  three  or  more  times  the   size  other  comparable  stores  and  are  sometimes  called  "destination"  retailers  or   "category-killers",  because  they  offer  a  wide  selection  of  the  same  type  of  items,   allowing  customers  to  comparison  shop  in  one  single  store,  rather  than  having  to   comparison  shop  at  a  variety  of  different  stores  (Buliung  and  Hernandez  2009).  Power   centres  describe  shopping  centres  with  three  or  more  big  box  stores  with  a  shared   parking  lot  and  some  other  smaller  retailers  (Hernandez,  et  al.,  2007).  Power  nodes   have  one  or  more  power  centres  with  other  big  box  stores  or  shopping  centres  within  a   one  kilometer  radius  (Yeates,  2000).  Power  nodes  typically  develop  near  a  major   highway  interchange  (Buliung  and  Hernandez,  2009).        Power  retail  development  emerged  as  a  disruptive  force  in  the  in  the  commercial   hierarchy  of  the  Greater  Toronto  Area  beginning  in  the  1990s.    Jones  and  Doucet   (2000;  2001)  were  the  first  researchers  to  address  the  emergence  of  "new  format"  or  big   box  retail  in  the  GTA.  This  research  examined  the  spatial  and  structural  impacts  of  big- box  retailing  using  the  databases  of  the  Centre  for  the  Study  of  Commercial  Activity  and   concluded  that  big  box  retail  had  changed  the  spatial  distribution  of  retail  and   entertainment.  Hernandez  and  Simmons  (2006)  describe  the  "power  retail"   phenomenon  and  define  the  four  key  concepts  that  comprise  power  retail;  big  box   stores,  power  retail,  power  centres  and  power  nodes.  This  research  tracks  spatial   distribution  of  power  retail  is  across  Canada  and  discusses  the  locational  preferences  of   these  new  commercial  clusters.        Buliung  and  Hernandez  (2009)  explore  the  relationship  between  power  retail  and  high- level  land-use  policies  in  their  report  published  by  the  Neptis  foundation.  This   comprehensive  study  on  power  retailing  in  the  GTA  examined  the  spatial  evolution  of   commercial  development  across  the  GTA  between  1996  and  2006  using  geographical   statistics.  The  study  found  that  within  nine  years  the  number  of  big  box  stores  had   doubled,  and  that  these  developments  had  clustered  as  power  centres  and  nodes  in   suburban  areas,  taking  advantage  of  low  location  costs  where  nearby  highways  make  it   5     

   easy  to  draw  regional  customers.  The  researchers  concluded  that  power  retail  had   implications  for  regional  planning  as  power  nodes  drew  consumers  on  a  regional  scale,   and  that  further  research  is  needed  into  the  travel  behavior  of  shoppers  and  how  this   could  influence  infrastructure  needs.      Simmons  (2012)  conducted  a  case  study  on  the  evolution  of  the  GTA's  commercial   structure  and  explained  the  economic  and  societal  factors  behind  the  dramatic  increase   in  power  retail  and  power  retail's  role  within  the  retail  economy  of  the  GTA.  Developers   and  retailers  build  this  form  of  retail  because  the  buildings  are  cheap,  the  location  and   labour  costs  are  low  and  the  retailer  is  able  to  offer  consumers  low  prices.  Simmons   (2012)  points  out  that  compared  to  previous  forms  of  retail  (the  traditional  retail  street   and  shopping  centres),  power  retail  is  much  more  "unplanned".  Power  centres  typically   have  few  amenities,  no  links  between  stores  and  no  relationship  with  public  transit.        In  terms  of  built  form,  existing  research  on  power  centres  has  found  that  their  "open   environment"  (as  opposed  to  an  enclosed  mall)  has  changed  the  way  that  customers   move  through  these  shopping  centres.  Power  retail  provides  few  amenities  compared  to   enclosed  shopping  malls  (little  seating,  washrooms  and  no  security).  While  planned   shopping  malls  encourage  pedestrian  movement  throughout  the  centre,  and  are   typically  integrated  with  public  transit  systems,  power  centres  have  little  consideration   for  pedestrian  movement  and  access  to  transit  (Lord  and  Bodkin,  1996;  Bodkin  and   Lord,  1007;  Wang,  et  al.  2000;  Lorch,  2005).        The  emergence  of  power  retail  in  the  mid  1990's  has  been  connected  to  the   implementation  free-trade  agreements  such  as  NAFTA,  the  decline  of  the  value  of  the   Canadian  dollar,  the  growth  in  new  residential  subdivisions  and  innovation  in  the  design   of  site  selection  of  retail  sites  (Hernandez  and  Simmons,  2006;  Jones  and  Doucet,   2000).  Free-trade  agreements  allowed  US  retailers  into  the  Canadian  market,  with   businesses  strategies  that  prompted  different  consumer  6behavior.  Importantly,  the   growth  of  power  centres  between  1996  and  2006  was  driven  by  the  growth  in  new   residential  subdivisions  (Jones  and  Doucet,  2000).  Retail  was  not  available  to  serve   these  new  communities,  and  the  low-cost  land  and  large  parcels  of  land  available  for   6     

   development  were  ideal  for  developers  who  wanted  to  make  their  stores  accessible  for   the  auto-oriented  surrounding  community.        The  "retail  sprawl"  and  accompanying  consumer  mobility  patterns  that  the  Greater   Toronto  Area  has  experienced  for  the  past  20  years  has  implications  for  the   organization  of  the  region.  More  than  ever  before,  consumers  are  willing  to  travel  farther   for  cheaper  prices  and  are  aided  by  highway  infrastructure.  Planners  objective  is  to   maintain  controlled  commercial  competition  within  a  commercial  hierarchy  has  been   undermined  by  retail  locations  in  distant  locations,  including  other  jurisdictions   (Hernandez  and  Simmons,  2006).  Despite  the  impact  of  consumer  mobility  patterns,   regional  transportation  plans  do  not  address  the  impact  of  power  nodes  on  the  regional   transportation  system.     

Policy  Context  
The  province  of  Ontario  has  a  prescriptive  top-down  land-use  planning  system,  with  the   province  directing  how  municipalities  should  be  developed  through  legislation,   Provincial  Policy  Statements,  and  provincial  land-use  plans.  The  Growth  Plan  for  the   Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  (2006),  the  Greenbelt  Plan  (2005)  and  the  Oak  Ridges   Moraine  Plan  (2001)  are  provincial  land  use  plans  that  direct  growth  within  the   municipalities  chosen  as  case  studies.          The  province's  first  policies  specifically  relating  to  retail  development  were  introduced  in   the  1970's.  The  Guidelines  for  Shopping  Centre  Development  (1975)  addressed  the   market  impacts  of  the  operation  of  shopping  centres.  These  early  policies  recognized   that  retail  development  had  to  be  viewed  with  respect  to  its  role  in  the  community  and   the  need  to  support  downtown  and  older  retail  strips.  Incentive  programs  in  support  of   downtowns  (such  as  the  Business  Improvement  Area  programs)  were  introduced  under   these  policies  (York  Region,  2015).       

7     

   The  Provincial  Policy  Statement  (1997)  represented  a  shift  in  provincial  policy  related  to   commercial  land  use  development.  Previously  existing  policies  had  focused  on  how  new   commercial  developments  may  impact  the  existing  commercial  hierarchy  of  a   community,  in  order  to  protect  the  planned  function  of  the  existing  hierarchy.  In  the  new   approach  introduced  through  the  PPS  (1997),  commercial  development  is  considered   one  component  of  "community  building"  and  long  with  other  types  of  development,  must   result  in  "efficient"  and  "cost-effective"  land  use  patterns.        Provincial  Policy  Statement   The  current  Provincial  Policy  Statement  (2014)  does  not  provide  any  policies  specific  to   commercial  development.  The  Provincial  Policy  Statements  following  1997  have   provided  general  directions  on  community  development  rather  than  direction  related  to   specific  forms  of  development.  These  general  directions  include  supporting  land  use   and  development  patterns  that  promote  a  compact  form  and  a  structure  of  nodes  and   corridors  and  the  use  of  active  transportation  and  transit.        Sections  of  the  PPS  (2014)  that  are  important  for  retail  development:     
  

Conversion  of  employment  areas  to  non-employment  uses  may  only  be   permitted  through  a  comprehensive  review  (Section  1.3.2).    
o  

This  is  related  to  retail  development  as  many  big-box  developments  were   taking  place  on  converted  employment  lands.    

  

Long-Term  Economic  Prosperity  should  be  supported  by  "maintaining  and,  where   possible,  enhancing  the  vitality  and  viability  of  downtowns  and  mainstreets"   (Section  1.7).    

  

Energy  Conservation,  Air  Quality  and  Climate  Change  supports  development   patterns  which,  a)  promote  compact  form  and  a  structure  of  nodes  and  corridors;   b)  promote  the  use  of  active  transportation  and  transit  in  and  between  residential,   employment  (including  commercial  and  industrial)  and  institutional  uses  and   other  areas;  c)  focus  major  employment,  commercial  and  other  travel-intensive   land  uses  on  sites  which  are  well-served  by  transit  where  this  exists  or  is  to  be   8  

  

   developed,  or  designing  these  to  facilitate  the  establishment  of  transit  in  the   future"  (Section  1.8).        Growth  Plan   The  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  (2006)  doesn't  provide  any   direction  specifically  related  to  retail  development,  but  places  emphasis  on  encouraging   the  development  compact  and  complete  communities.  Policy  2.2.2.1  describes  the   concept  of  complete  communities  as  communities  that  have  "a  diverse  mix  of  land  uses,   a  range  and  mix  of  employment  and  housing  types,  high  quality  public  open  space  and   easy  access  to  local  stores  and  services"  (MPIR,  2006,  13).  Compact  urban  form  is   defined  as  "a  land  use  pattern  that  encourages  efficient  use  of  land,  walkable   neighbourhoods,  mixed  land  uses  (residential,  retail,  workplace  and  institutional  all   within  one  neighbourhood),  proximity  to  transit  and  reduced  need  for  infrastructure.        While  the  provincial  concepts  of  complete  communities  and  compact  urban  form  include   retail,  the  Plan  provides  more  detailed  targets  related  to  residential  and  employment   than  retail  and  services.  For  instance,  the  Plan  provides  a  definition  for  "major  office"   (which  should  be  directed  to  Urban  Growth  Centres),  but  no  definition  for  "major  retail"   (Province  of  Ontario,  2006).        The  only  retail  development  issue  that  the  province  has  addressed  is  the  development   of  large-format  retail  on  lands  designated  for  employment  uses.  Section  2.2.6.5  states   that  proposed  conversions  of  employment  lands  to  non-employment  uses  require  a   municipal  comprehensive  review  and  Major  Retail  is  not  considered  an  employment   use.        Relevant  sections:  
  

Encourage  the  development  of  "complete  communities  with  a  diverse  mix  of  land   uses,  a  range  and  mix  of  employment  and  housing  types,  high  quality  public   open  space  and  easy  access  to  local  stores  and  service"  (Section  2.2.2  h).   9  

  

  
  

Promote  economic  development  by  "providing  an  appropriate  mix  of  employment   uses  including  industrial,  commercial  and  institutional  uses  to  meet  long-term   needs"  (Section  2.2.6.2).     Conversion  of  employment  lands  to  non-employment  uses  is  permitted  through  a   municipal  comprehensive  review.  Major  Retail  uses  are  considered  non- employment  uses  (Section  2.2.6.5).      

  

  

New  development  in  greenfield  areas  will  be  "planned,  designated,  zones  and   designed  in  a  manner  that,  "a)  contributes  to  creating  complete  communities  [...]   C)  provides  a  diverse  mix  of  land  uses,  including  residential  and  employment   uses,  to  support  vibrant  neighbourhoods..."  (Section  2.7.1).  

   Other  Provincial  Direction   In  2008,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Infrastructure  Renewal  released  a  paper  entitled,   "Planning  for  Employment  in  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe".  This  discussion  paper   expressed  concern  at  the  development  of  power  centres  clustered  along  major   highways,  explaining,  "better  planning  for  retail  activities  will  not  only  help  to  take   advantage  of  the  opportunities  for  more  vibrant,  complete  communities,  but  it  will  also   help  to  protect  important  employment  lands  that  are  better  suited  to  other  types  of   economic  activities"  (Province  of  Ontario,  2008,  Section  5.4).  Municipalities  were   advised  to  be  clear  in  their  official  plans  about  which  employment  areas  may  include   retail  uses,  in  order  to  avoid  losing  these  lands  to  major  retail  developments.  The  paper   was  meant  to  solicit  feedback  from  stakeholders  in  order  to  develop  guidelines  to   support  better  planning  for  retail  activities,  including:     
  

proactively  planning  for  the  appropriate  location  and  design  of  major  retail,   including  large-format  retail     overcoming  barriers  to  mixed-use  retail  developments  in  intensification  areas  

  

   As  of  March  2016,  no  guidelines  regarding  retail  development  have  been  released  by   the  province.     10     

   Ontario  Municipal  Board   The  decisions  of  the  Ontario  Municipal  Board  (OMB)  have  influenced  municipal  retail   policy.  The  OMB  is  a  quasi-judicial  administrative  tribunal  where  stakeholders  can   appeal  municipal  land-use  planning  outcomes.  The  OMB  adjudicates  these  disputes   and  has  the  power  to  change  municipal  planning  decisions.  The  decisions  of  the  Board   are  based  on  the  planning  arguments  and  evidence  presented  for  each  case,  and  these   decisions  are  not  based  on  precedent.  However,  OMB  decisions  still  exert  influence   over  municipal  policy  language.        In  decisions  regarding  the  commercial  development,  the  OMB's  assessments  are  based   on  the  Province's  initial  policies  regarding  commercial  development,  instituted  by  the   1975  Guidelines  for  Shopping  Centre  Development.  Proposed  commercial  development   should  be  assessed  based  on  its  market  impact  on  the  local  planned  commercial   structure.  Decisions  made  in  the  1990's  proved  that  the  test  for  intervention  into  the   market  was  significant.  The  Board  would  only  intervene  when  the  market  impact  would   be  "deleterious  or  harmful"  to  existing  facilities  to  the  extent  that  the  development  would   "jeopardize"  or  "undermine  or  destroy"  the  proper  planned  function  of  existing  land  uses   (Webber  and  Hernandez,  2016).        Recent  studies  on  the  influence  of  the  OMB  has  demonstrated  that  the  decision-making   process  has  influenced  big-box  planning  outcomes  (Webber  and  Hernandez,  2016).  In   a  study  of  65  large-format  retail  appeals,  it  was  found  that  some  appeals  are  used  as  a   tool  to  conduct  negotiations  rather  than  contest  municipal  decisions.  When  a  proponent   appeals  a  decision  by  a  municipality,  the  municipality  is  under  greater  pressure  to  come   to  the  agreement  at  the  pre-hearing  stage  in  order  to  avoid  an  expensive  and  lengthy   trial.  This  process  gives  proponents  the  upper  hand,  as  they  typically  have  more   resources  and  thus  are  less  concerned  about  avoiding  a  hearing.

Case  Studies  
Introduction  
The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  describe  the  evolution  of  commercial  land  use  policies  of   municipalities  in  York  Region  between  1995  and  2015.  A  case  study  approach  was   chosen,  which  allows  for  the  in  depth  examination  of  a  few  cases  over  a  duration  of   time.  This  approach  is  particularly  useful  in  the  field  of  planning,  where  issues  are  only   understandable  within  their  particular  geographical,  political  and  social  context.        Case  studies  were  conducted  on  three  municipalities  in  York  Region;  Vaughan,   Markham  and  Richmond  Hill.  These  municipalities  were  chosen  for  several  reasons:  1)   they  were  the  site  of  enormous  growth  in  commercial  and  residential  development  over   the  past  thirty  years;  2)  they  are  subject  to  provincial  policies  which  require  them  to   change  the  pattern  of  their  development  3);  they  will  continue  to  experience  enormous   growth,  including  a  significant  amount  of  intensification  (Growth  Outlook  for  the  Greater   Golden  Horseshoe,  2005).        These  case  studies  are  informed  by  content  analysis  of  land-use  policy  documents,   specifically  municipal  Official  Plans,  staff  reports  and  commercial  land  use  studies.   Content  analysis  is  a  technique  of  qualitative  data  analysis,  which  involves  examining   information  in  written  or  symbolic  materials.  Material  is  reviewed  to  analyze  and  create  a   system  for  recording  specific  aspects  of  it.  The  data  is  organized  into  categories  on  the   basis  of  themes,  concepts  or  patterns.  Using  these  findings,  the  researcher  develops   new  concepts,  formulates  conceptual  definitions  and  examines  the  relationship  among   concepts  (Neuman  and  Robson,  2012).          The  content  analysis  performed  for  these  case  studies  involved  background  research   on  commercial  retail  planning  in  Ontario,  an  initial  review  of  all  policy  documents  to  gain   an  overall  understanding  of  what  policy  exists,  and  a  subsequent  in-depth  review  which   involved  comparing  the  policy  approaches  of  different  municipalities.  It  is  during  this  in- 12     

   depth  review  that  policy  themes  were  identified  in  these  documents.  These  themes   were  informed  by  background  research  on  commercial  retail  planning  in  Ontario,  as  well   as  the  policy  discussions  in  the  commercial  land  use  studies  which  informed  these   policies.      The  following  case  studies  will  describe  the  context  of  each  municipality,  a  brief   description  of  their  commercial  structure,  a  detailed  description  of  their  commercial   policy  between  1995  and  2015  and  a  summary  of  their  commercial  policy  approach   based  on  content  analysis.    

York  Region  
Context    
The  Regional  Municipality  of  York  is  located  north  of  the  City  of  Toronto  and  extends  to   Lake  Simcoe  and  Holland  Marsh.  It  is  part  of  the  broader  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe   where  over  six  million  people  live  and  work  (Figure  1).  York  Region  is  comprised  of  nine   local  municipalities  and  has  a  population  of  just  over  1  million.    The  Region  out-performs   the  Ontario  average  in  the  areas  of  post-secondary  educational  attainment,  household   income  and  average  employment  rate  (Statistics  Canada,  2012).        While  the  Region  began  as  a  collection  of  bedroom  communities  serving  the  City  of   Toronto,  it  has  since  evolved  into  a  diverse  urban  region  and  a  major  centre  for   economic  activity  in  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe.  The  Region  is  experiencing  a   period  of  rapid  growth  that  began  in  the  1990s  and  is  expected  to  continue  past  2041   (York  Region,  2014).  This  growth  will  be  directed  by  provincial  land  use  plans,  such  as   the  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  (2006),  the  Greenbelt  Plan  (2005),   the  Oak  Ridges  Moraine  Plan  (2001).  Additionally,  the  Region  will  be  recipient  of   significant  investment  in  public  transit,  as  outlined  in  Metrolinx's  the  Big  Move  (2008).      The  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  (2006)  identified  four  Urban  Growth   Centres  (UGC)  within  York  Region.  These  UGCs  (designated  as  Regional  Centres  in   13     

   the  York  Region  Official  Plan),  will  be  a  "focal  area  of  investment  for  institutional  and   region-wide  public  services,  as  well  as  commercial,  recreational,  cultural  and   entertainment  uses"  and  will  be  planned  to  achieve  minimum  gross  density  targets  by   2031  (York  Region,  2010,  Section  5.4.19).  Three  of  these  Urban  Growth  Centres  are   located  within  local  municipalities  that  are  used  as  case  studies  in  this  paper;  Markham   Centre,  Richmond  Hill/Langstaff  Gateway  and  Vaughan  Corporate  Centre  (Figure  2).  All   of  these  UGCs  currently  have  power  centres  in  use  within  their  boundary,  or  major   power  nodes  in  close  proximity  (Figure  4).

Commercial  Structure    
York  Region's  commercial  retail  network  consists  of  34.7  million  square  feet  of  retail   space  and  10,500  retail  and  service  businesses  (York  Region,  2015).        The  highest  order  shopping  centres  and  retail  nodes  are  located  in  Vaughan,  Richmond   Hill,  Markham  and  Newmarket.  Most  of  these  nodes  are  located  within  or  in  the  vicinity   17     

   of  the  Region's  Centres  and  Corridors  and  the  400  series  highways.  Super-regional   nodes  include:      Markville  Shopping  Centre  in  Markham,        Upper  Canada  Mall  node  in  Newmarket/East  Gwillimbury      Highway  400  and  Highway  7  in  Vaughan  and  Vaughan  Mills.

Commercial  Policy  Overview  1994-2016  
York  Region  1994  Official  Plan     The  1994  was  organized  into  three  themes,  that  were  based  on  York  Region's  1993   Strategic  Plan,  Vision  2021:  Sustainable  Natural  Environment,  Economic  Vitality  and   Healthy  Communities.  Commercial  uses  are  mentioned  under  the  theme  Economic   Vitality,  and  area  municipalities  are  directed  to  place  an  emphasis  on  "community  and   design"  (York  Region,  1994,  Section  3.3.7).  A  review  of  the  1994  Official  Plan  reveals   two  themes  related  to  commercial  development:  protecting  the  existing  urban  and   commercial  structure  and  and  emphasis  on  urban  design  elements,  such  as  the  location   of  parking  areas,  the  relationship  of  buildings  to  the  street  and  the  integration  of   pedestrian  systems  in  the  development.      Existing  urban  and  commercial  structure      There  is  a  need  to  ensure  that  regionally  significant  retail  facilities  are  designed   and  located  in  such  a  way  to  serve  the  needs  of  residents  while  not  detracting  from   existing  and  proposed  urban  centres,  mainstreets  and  the  proposed  community   structure  of  this  plan  (Section  3.3).        Urban  Design      Area  municipalities  should  be  encouraged  to  plan  for  retail  facilities  as  part  of   communities  with  an  emphasis  on  community  and  design.  The  following  should  be   considered;  a)  the  meshing  of  the  proposals  street  grid  and  pedestrian  system  into   the  community,  b)  the  mix  of  residential  and  office  land  uses,  c)  the  integration  of   parks,  natural  areas  and  public  spaces  d)  the  relationship  of  the  buildings  to  the   street  e)  the  distribution  of  floor  space  densities  across  the  site  and  f)  the   avoidance  of  large  expanses  of  parking  areas  (Section  3.3.7).      York  Region  2010  Official  Plan     The  2010  York  Region  Official  Plan  provides  more  direction  related  to  retail   development  than  the  1994  Official  Plan.  A  review  of  the  OP  reveals  four  prominent   19     

   themes:  integration  of  retail  into  communities,  quality  urban  design,  the  intensification   and  redevelopment  of  existing  retail  and  an  emphasis  on  ensuring  development  is   transit-oriented  and  walkable.        Integration  of  Retail,  Transit-oriented  and  walkable,  and  Urban  design      Planning  for  Retail  Objective:  To  ensure  that  retail  is  well-designed  and   appropriately  integrated  into  communities  in  a  manner  that  encourages  walking,   cycling  and  transit  (Section  4.4).      To  require  that  retail  be  designed  to  be  walkable,  transit-supportive  and   integrated  into  communities  and  pedestrian  cycling  networks,  with  high-quality   urban  design  (Section  4.4.1.).      Intensification  and  Redevelopment,  and  Urban  design      To  work  with  local  municipalities  to  improve  urban  design  in  new  retail   developments  and  to  identify  opportunities  for  the  intensification  and  revitalization   of  existing  retail  (Section  4.4.2).      That  major  retail  sites  should  be  designated  to  support  redevelopment  or   retrofitting  (Section  4.4.7).        Review  of  Commercial  Land  Use  Policies  2015     As  part  of  the  Region's  Official  Plan  review  and  update,  the  Region  is  development  an   approach  to  guide  local  municipalities  on  planning  for  retail  development.  The  Region   aims  to  "shift  the  market"  from  low-density  and  auto-oriented  commercial  development   to  more  compact,  mixed-use  forms  (York  Region,  2015).  Tate  Economic  Research  and   Macaulay  Shiomi  Howson  Ltd  were  hired  to  conduct  a  Retail  Trends  Study,  which   included:   1)   an  overview  of  the  retail  sector  in  York  Region;     2)   assessment  of  opportunities  and  constraints  of  mixed-use,  compact  retail   development  in  the  Region's  Centres  and  Corridors  and  new  communities     3)   assessment  of  land  budget  approaches  for  recommending  retail  uses  and;   20     

   4)   recommendations  on  tools  to  guide  retail  development  in  support  of  the  policy   objectives  of  the  Regional  Official  Plan,  the  Growth  Plan  and  the  Provincial  Policy   Statement.        The  report  found  that  the  greatest  potential  for  compact  and  mixed-use  commercial   development  exists  within  the  Region's  Centres  and  Corridors  (Regional  Centres/Urban   Growth  Centres).  These  areas  provide  the  necessary  location  characteristics,  such  as   access,  visibility,  mobility  and  proximity  to  a  sizable  market  to  achieve  the  high  land   values  necessary  for  mixed  use  and  dense  development.  Outside  of  the  Centres  and   Corridors,  opportunities  for  mixed  use  development  are  currently  limited  due  to  the   supply  characteristics  of  the  existing  retail  network,  auto-oriented  transportation   network,  slow  growth  of  high  density  residential  and  employment  areas,  and  the   availability  of  greenfield  sites  for  commercial  development.        The  report  concluded  that  York  Region  has  a  strong  policy  framework  that  encourages   compact,  mixed-use  forms  of  commercial  development.  However,  the  Region  must  look   beyond  policy  to  support  this  type  of  development.  An  "implementation  toolbox"  was   outlined,  which  included:      minor  policy  modifications  at  Regional  and  local  levels        community  improvement  plans      expedited  planning/development  processes      zoning/development  permit  strategies      parking  strategies      The  report  observed  that  a  "shift"  towards  mixed  use  development  can  already  be  seen   the  development  at  Markham  Centre  and  Vaughan  Metropolitan  Centre,  and  it  is   anticipated  that  future  mixed  use  development  will  also  occur  in  the  Region's  Centres   and  Corridors.    

Overview    
Over  the  past  twelve  years,  York  Region  has  had  two  iterations  of  its  Official  Plan,  the   1994  Official  Plan  that  is  pre-Growth  Plan  and  the  2010  Official  Plan  which  was  adopted   21     

   four  years  after  the  Growth  Plan.  As  Regional  Official  Plans,  they  provide  broad   direction  for  the  planning  of  communities  rather  than  specific  directions,  which  can  be   found  in  lower  tier  municipal  official  plans.        The  1994  Official  Plan  focused  on  how  the  design  of  commercial  developments   integrates  them  into  the  community.  The  2010  Official  Plan  also  prioritizes  the   integration  of  retail  into  the  community  and  provides  further  direction  related  to   commercial  development  regarding  intensification  and  redevelopment  of  existing  retail,   and  ensuring  that  developments  are  walkable  and  transferable.        From  the  1994  Official  Plan  to  the  2010  Official  Plan,  there  has  been  a  continued   emphasis  on  ensuring  quality  urban  design  of  commercial  development.  While  the  1994   Official  Plan  provides  specific  elements  of  site  design  to  consider  (for  example,   relationship  of  buildings  to  the  street),  the  2010  Official  Plan  does  not  outline  these   specific  elements.  Instead,  the  2010  Official  Plan  simply  directs  that  retail  should   incorporate  "effective  urban  design"  to  ensure  the  "integration  of  retail  into  the   community"  (York  Region,  2010,  Section  4.4).  Detail  on  specific  site  design  elements   may  have  been  omitted  in  order  to  allow  lower-tier  municipalities  to  greater  freedom  in   what  they  consider  a  well-designed  commercial  development  would  look  like.       

Vaughan  
Context    
The  City  of  Vaughan  is  located  in  the  south-western  end  of  the  Region  and  has  a   population  of  approximately  288,000  people  (Statistics  Canada,  2012).  The  City  of   Vaughan  originated  from  a  collection  of  rural  villages;  Woodbridge,  Kleinburg,  Maple   and  Thornhill.  These  villages,  as  well  as  smaller  communities  were  incorporated  in  1974   to  create  the  Town  of  Vaughan.  After  the  expansion  of  water  and  sewer  services  in  the   1970's  Vaughan  experienced  an  explosion  of  growth.  Between  1971  and  1991,  the   population  grew  from  15,000  to  over  100,000.  Throughout  the  1990's  the  City  continued   22     

   to  grow  at  a  rapid  rate  and  became  a  major  centre  of  economic  activity  (City  of   Vaughan,  2010b).        As  per  the  York  Region  Official  Plan,  Vaughan  is  planning  to  accommodate  twenty-nine   percent  (29%)  of  the  Regional  population  growth  and  thirty-three  percent  (33%)  of  the   Region's  employment  growth,  resulting  in  approximately  167,300  new  residents  and   103,900  new  between  2006  and  2031  (York  Region,  2010).  The  Province  has   designated  the  core  of  the  Vaughan  Metropolitan  Centre  (VMC)  as  an  Urban  Growth   Centre  (UGC).  The  VMC  is  located  along  the  Highway  7  rapid  transit  corridor  and  at  the   terminus  of  the  Toronto-York  subway.  Growth  within  the  Urban  Growth  Centre  is   planned  to  meet  or  exceed  the  requirements  for  a  density  of  200  people  and  jobs  per   hectare  as  set  out  in  the  Growth  Plan  (2006)  and  the  York  Region  Official  Plan  (2010).   The  Vaughan  Metropolitan  Centre  is  subject  to  a  secondary  plan  and  a  Community   Improvement  Plan  (City  of  Vaughan,  2015).        The  lands  planned  for  the  Vaughan  Metropolitan  Centre  (VMC)  are  currently  housing  a   power  node  made  up  of  four  different  power  centres;  Westbridge  Power  Centre,   SmartCentre,  Colossus  Power  Entertainment  Centre,  the  Interchange  and  Highway  400   &  Highway  7  (Figure  5).  These  commercial  uses  were  developed  gradually  between   1995  and  2005.

Commercial  Structure  
In  2010,  the  City  of  Vaughan  retained  urbanMetrics  to  conduct  a  Commercial  Land  Use   Review  as  part  of  its  Official  Plan  Review  (City  of  Vaughan,  2010a).  This  review   included  an  inventory  of  Vaughan's  commercial  structure.        This  report  identified  unique  attributes  of  Vaughan's  Commercial  Structure;  a  large   tourist  market,  historic  village  cores,  a  large  proportion  of  independent  retailers,  a  wide   range  of  culinary  options  and  its  position  as  a  regional  retail  centre.        Major  retail  nodes  were  identified  and  classified  into  six  commercial  node  type:  super   regional,  regional,  district,  village  core,  local  and  arterial.     Super  Regional  nodes  that  draw  consumers  from  across  the  GTA        Power  Centre  Node  at  the  intersection  of  Highway  400  and  Highway  7      Vaughan  Mills  Mall  at  Rutherford  Road  and  Highway  400        The  commercial  inventory  study  conducted  in  2009  found  that  Vaughan  had  14.2  million   square  feet  of  commercial  space.

Commercial  Land  Use  Policy  Overview  1995-2016    
Official  Plan  Amendments  400  (1995)   Vaughan's  commercial  hierarchy  was  first  shaped  by  OPA  400,  which  was  approved  by   the  province  in  1995.  OPA  400  provided  a  comprehensive  framework  to  guide  the   development  of  three  new  communities  (Vellore,  Carrville  and  the  Woodbridge   Expansion  Area).  These  policies  were  guided  by  a  Retail  Planning  Study  conducted  in   1993  and  1994  by  Stamm  Economic  Research.  OPA  400  laid  out  a  retail  hierarchy  that   allowed  commercial  uses  to  locate  within  medium  and  high  density.    

26     

   Official  Plan  Amendment  500  (1998)   Vaughan  Corporate  Centre  Plan  (OPA  500)  was  approved  in  1998  and  recognized  the   centre  as  the  highest  order  uses  in  the  City's  commercial  hierarchy.  It  was  also   identified  in  the  Regional  Official  Plan  as  a  Regional  Centre,  and  a  focus  for  residential,   institutional  and  business  activities.    The  Vaughan  Corporate  Centre  secondary  plan   overlaps  with  what  is  now  the  Vaughan  Metropolitan  Centre.  At  the  time  that  this  plan   was  adopted,  a  significant  portion  of  the  secondary  plan  area  was  already  developed  or   approved  for  development  for  big  box  retail  uses,  new  industrial  business  parks  and   mature  industrial  uses.  The  Vaughan  Corporate  Centre  secondary  plan  set  out  a  vision   for  this  area  as  a  was  to  be  based  on  principles  that  support  "transit  use,  compact  urban   form  and  an  integration  of  land  uses"  (City  of  Vaughan,  1998,  Section  2.2).  This  was   supported  and  updated  in  OPA  600.     Official  Plan  Amendment  600  (2001)   Vaughan's  commercial  structure  was  defined  by  OPA  600  (Part  B  Section  4.2.2)  which   identified  seven  groups  which  form  a  hierarchy  of  uses.  This  hierarchy  of  uses  was   based  on  the  servicing  needs  of  residents.  For  example,  neighbourhood  commercial   centres  were  to  address  the  weekly  needs  of  residents,  while  local  convenience   commercial  uses  address  the  day-to-day  convenience  needs  of  residents  (City  of   Vaughan,  2001,  Section  2.3.  viii.;  Section  2.3.ix).        The  predominant  themes  in  these  policies  were  the  establishment  and  protection  the   commercial  structure,  and  the  promotion  quality  urban  design;      Protection  of  the  Commercial  Structure      To  establish  a  hierarchy  of  commercial  areas  and  facilities  of  various  sizes  and   compositions  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  Vaughan  residents  and  the  traveling  public   (Section  2.3.i).      To  foster  the  role  and  economic  vitality  of  established  commercial  areas  within   Vaughan  (Section  2.3.ii).      27     

   Urban  Design   ·   To  promote  shopping  districts  that  cater  to  and  encourage  pedestrian  traffic,  and   are  characterized  by  distinctive  building  forms  and  specialty  goods  and  services   (Section  2.3.v)   ·   To  provide  within  the  primary  commercial  areas  of  each  urban  village  [...]  and  to   ensure  that  the  areas  are  developed  in  accordance  with  sound  principles  of   urban  design  and  in  particular  are  well  integrated  with  adjacent  land  uses   (Section  2.3.vii).     Commercial  Land  Use  Review  (2009)   In  2009,  a  Commercial  Land  Use  Review  was  completed  as  part  of  the  Official  Plan   Review.  The  review  concluded  that  the  existing  commercial  policies  are  appropriate   given  demographic  and  market  trends,  which  allow  for  higher  density  development  and   a  mix  of  uses  in  some  areas.  The  policy  recommendations  provided  were  related  to   incorporating  commercial  retail  into  mixed-use  development  and  improving  the  urban   design  and  siting  of  commercial  development.  General  policy  recommendations  for   encouraging  intensification  in  commercial  development  included;     ·   incorporating  retailing  in  intensification  sites,     ·   ensuring  there  are  pedestrian  connections  to  transit  nodes,     ·   mid-block  pedestrian  connections  to  facilitate  connectivity,     ·   a  mix  of  commercial  spaces,     ·   accommodation  for  large  food  stores,     ·   on-street  parking  to  support  street  front  retailing,  and;     ·   building  scale  and  orientation  to  ensure  sunlight  penetration  onto  pedestrian   corridors.        Official  Plan  2010   The  2010  Vaughan  Official  Plan  incorporates  the  recommendations  provided  in  the   Commercial  Land  Use  Review.  The  Official  Plan  (2010)  establishes  an  urban  structure   based  on  a  hierarchy  of  intensification  areas,  that  range  in  height  and  intensify  of  use.   28     

   New  commercial  development  is  to  be  integrated  into  each  level  of  this  intensification   hierarchy.          Retail  policies  in  the  updated  Official  Plan  place  an  emphasis  on  building  pedestrian- friendly  and  transit  supportive  commercial  areas  with  attractive  urban  design,  and   revitalization,  intensification  and  redevelopment  of  existing  retail.  These  new  policies   direct  new  retail  to  Intensification  areas,  where  they  will  be  part  of  an  overall  mixed  use   development.        Transit-oriented  and  walkable  and  Urban  Design   ·   To  require  that  new  retail  be  designed  to  be  walkable,  transit  supportive  and   integrated  into  communities  and  pedestrian  and  cycling  networks  with  high- quality  urban  design  (Section  5.2.3.2).     ·   That  the  primary  location  for  new  retail  uses  is  planned  to  be  Intensification   Areas,  where  they  will  benefit  from  transit  service  and  help  build  mixed-use   communities.  Retail  developments  within  Intensification  Areas  will  support  the   general  objectives  and  policies  for  these  through  the  following;  [...]  b.  retail  uses   will  be  sited  and  oriented  to  support  walking,  cycling  and  transit  use  (Section   5.2.3.4).        Additionally,  the  2010  OP  policies  reflect  a  desire  to  divert  from  the  prevailing  power   centre  mode  of  commercial  development.  The  Policy  section  related  to  retail   development,  entitled  "Supporting  and  Transforming  the  Retail  Sector",  directs  that   "existing  standalone  shopping  centres  will  be  permitted  to  transform  into  mixed-use   buildings  and  districts  that  incorporate  residential,  office  and  institutional  uses"  (City  of   Vaughan,  2010b,  Section  5.2.3).    

Overview  
Vaughan's  commercial  hierarchy  was  formed  by  a  series  of  Official  Plan  Amendments   prior  to  the  2010  Official  Plan.  These  Amendments  demonstrate  that  the  City  has  been   planning  for  higher-density,  compact  commercial  developments  beginning  in  the  mid- 29     

   1990's.  The  vision  for  what  is  now  the  Vaughan  Metropolitan  Centre  was  laid  in  the   Vaughan  Corporate  Centre  Secondary  Plan  (1998),  and  eighteen  years  later  the  City  is   still  working  to  intensify  the  development  of  the  area  through  a  revised  Secondary  Plan   and  Community  Improvement  Plan  (City  of  Vaughan,  2015).          Commercial  land  use  policy  in  Vaughan  evolved  from  establishing  a  commercial   structure  based  on  planned  function,  towards  an  approach  that  integrates  land  uses  in  a   hierarchy  of  intensification.  Prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  Growth  Plan  (2006),  the  City  of   Vaughan  was  utilized  the  principles  mixed-use,  compact  development  in  some  areas,   most  notably  the  Vaughan  Corporate  Centre.  The  general  commercial  policies  outlined   in  OPA  600  spoke  to  protection  of  the  commercial  hierarchy,  this  concept  was   abandoned  in  the  2010  Official  Plan,  which  outlines  a  hierarchy  of  intensification.       

Richmond  Hill  
Context    
The  Town  of  Richmond  Hill  is  centrally  located  within  York  Region,  and  has  a  population   of  approximately  181,000  (Statistics  Canada,  2012).  Like  most  of  the  local  municipalities   in  York  Region,  it  has  experienced  rapid  growth  over  the  past  25  years.  Growth  and   development  peaked  in  the  1990's,  and  while  this  pace  of  growth  has  now  declined,  the   town  continues  to  grow  at  a  stable  rate.  The  York  Region  growth  management  forecast   anticipates  that  the  Richmond  Hill  will  absorb  approximately  70,000  new  residents  and   approximately  40,000  new  jobs  between  2006  and  2031.  Approximately  52%  of   Richmond  Hill  is  located  within  the  Oak  Ridges  Moraine,  including  the  most  urbanized   part  of  the  Moraine  and  its  significant  east-west  natural  linkage  corridor  (Town  of   Richmond  Hill,  2010).      Richmond  Hill  has  a  designated  Urban  Growth  Centre  (UGC),  Richmond  Hill/Langstaff   Gateway.  This  Urban  Growth  Centre  contains  land  in  both  Richmond  Hill  and  the  City  of   Markham.  As  per  the  Places  to  Grow  Act  (2005),  this  UGC  is  planned  for  intensification   30     

   in  the  York  Region  Official  Plan  (2010),  which  expands  upon  the  boundaries  of  the  UGC   to  create  the  Richmond  Hill  Regional  Centre  (Figure  7).  Richmond  Hill  Regional  Centre,   which  is  located  north  and  east  of  the  intersection  of  Highway  7  and  Yonge  Street  and   just  north  of  Highway  407.  It  is  located  in  proximity  to  proposed  higher  order  transit   along  Yonge  Street,  Highway  7  and  the  Langstaff  GO  train  line.  The  density  target  for   the  Richmond  Hill  UGC  includes  200  residents  and  jobs  combined  per  hectare  by  2031   (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  2010).            Currently,  the  Richmond  Hill  Regional  Centre  is  the  site  of  large  format  retail  and   associated  parking  lots,  a  few  high  rise  residential  towers  and  some  smaller  scale   commercial  and  residential  development  along  Yonge  Street  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,   2009c).

Commercial  structure  
A  Commercial  Needs  Study  conducted  by  Hemson  Consulting  in  2009  provides  an   overview  of  the  commercial  structure  in  Richmond  Hill  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  2009b).   The  built  structure  of  the  town  has  been  guided  by  a  planned  hierarchy  of  community   types  and  this  hierarchy  has  been  built  out.  There  exists  a  variety  of  commercial   developments  in  the  town,  including  regional  shopping,  power  centres,  and  community   and  neighbourhood  retail.        Yonge  Street  (Main  Street)  defines  the  retail  commercial  structure  on  a  north-south  axis,   with  nodes  of  activity  on  major  intersections.

Official  Plan  Amendment  129  (1998)   Prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  2010  Official  Plan,  Richmond  Hill's  policies  regarding   commercial  development  were  set  out  in  Official  Plan  Amendment  129,  adopted  in   1998.  These  policies  established  an  explicitly  commercial  hierarchy  based  on  the   planned  function  of  the  development,  meaning  whose  needs  are  being  served   (neighbourhood,  town,  region),  the  size  of  the  development  and  the  number  of  anchor   tenants.     Commercial  Needs  Study  (2009)   Between  2008  and  2010,  Richmond  Hill  completed  a  review  of  the  Official  Plan.  As  part   of  this  review,  an  Economic  Policy  Review,  including  a  Commercial  Needs  Assessment,   was  completed  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  2009a;  2009b).  This  review  recommended  that   the  commercial  hierarchy  framework  be  replaced  by  one  that  manages  change  in   33     

   commercial  areas  through  the  urban  structure  of  centres  and  corridors.  Additionally,   policy  in  the  new  Official  Plan  should  refrain  from  including  new  commercial   designations  and  should  divert  or  redirect  retail  commercial  development  to  mixed-use   intensification  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  2009b)        The  report  also  recommended  adopting  moving  away  from  the  "separated  land  use"   approach  which  has  led  to  "a  pattern  of  retail  commercial  uses  being  differentiated  by   function,  separated  by  distance,  yet  linked  by  road  or  transit"  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,   2009b,  p.24).  The  report  argues  that  this  has  resulted  in  a  built  form  that  is  stand-alone   one  storey  buildings,  with  auto-oriented  design  characteristics.  Instead,  retail  should  be   treated  as  an  "integrated  land  use".  This  means  combining  a  mix  of  uses  in  the  same   building  or  node.  The  report  refers  to  this  as  an  "emerging  model  in  retail  commercial   planning",  and  this  approach  can  be  seen  in  the  approach  of  both  the  City  of  Vaughan   and  the  City  of  Markham  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  2009b,  p.  24-25).     Official  Plan  2010   These  recommendations  of  the  Economic  Policy  Review  (2009)  were  implemented  in   the  Town  of  Richmond  Hill  2010  Official  Plan,  which  adopts  an  "integrated"  approach  to   retail  development.  The  urban  structure  is  organized  into  a  hierarchy  of  intensification   areas,  with  commercial  uses  integrated  into  each  level  of  the  hierarchy  that  allows  for   mixed-use.        As  part  of  this  hierarchy,  the  Official  Plan  identifies  Key  Development  Areas,  which  are   intensification  areas  located  in  a  Regional  Corridor.  In  these  intensification  areas  "public   rapid  transit  corridors  intersect  with  major  nodes  of  retail  and  commercial  development   activity,  and  where  opportunities  exist  for  redevelopment  of  large  sites  that  can  support   new  public  streets,  parks  and  urban  open  space  connections"  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill   2010,  Section  4.4).  This  Key  Development  Area  designation  reflects  a  clear  desire  to   facilitate  redevelopment  of  the  existing  large-format  commercial  developments  existing   in  these  sites.  Section  4.4.1.1  states,  "it  is  a  long  term  objective  of  this  Plan  that   intensification  of  existing  major  retail  uses  occur  through  redevelopment  into  a  more   compact  built  form"  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill  2010,  Section  4.4.1.1).     34     

      In  terms  of  policy  specifically  related  to  retail  development,  the  policy  themes  present  in   the  2010  Official  Plan  are;  integrating  retail  into  communities,  transit-oriented  and   walkable  development,  and  an  emphasis  on  quality  urban  design.  Policies  regarding   retail  development  are  included  with  Employment  in  Centres  and  Corridors  policy.        Integrated  into  communities,  Transit-oriented  and  walkable  and  Urban  design      New  retail  including  major  retail  shall  be  designed  to  be  pedestrian-friendly,   transit-oriented,  and  integrated  into  communities  and  pedestrian  and  cycling   networks,  and  be  designed  to  achieve  high  quality  urban  design  (Section   3.3.2.5).    

Overview    
Prior  to  the  Growth  Plan,  Richmond  Hill's  commercial  policy  was  outlined  as  a   commercial  hierarchy  in  Official  Plan  Amendment  129.  This  hierarchy  classified   commercial  developments  based  on  their  planned  function,  size  and  number  of  anchor   tenants.  Many  of  the  commercial  developments  that  had  been  built  under  this  approach   were  stand-alone,  one-storey  buildings.  The  2010  Official  Plan  adopted  an  "integrated"   approach,  rather  than  a  "separated  land  use"  approach  that  establishes  a  hierarchy  of   intensification  areas.  Some  of  these  areas  are  now  designated  Key  Development  Areas,   which  are  existing  major  nodes  of  retail  that  are  expected  to  be  intensified  and   redeveloped  as  mixed-use  areas.          

City  of  Markham  
Context    
The  City  of  Markham  is  located  in  the  south-western  edge  of  York  Region  and  has  a   population  of  approximately  310,000  (Statistics  Canada,  2012).  The  City  originated  from   a  collection  of  rural  villages;  Unionville,  Markham,  Milliken  and  Thornhilll.  These   35     

   villages,  as  well  as  smaller  communities  were  incorporated  in  1971  to  create  the  Town   of  Markham.  The  Town  moved  to  City  status  in  2012,  after  experiencing  significant   growth  and  becoming  a  significant  employment  centre  within  York  Region  and  the   Greater  Toronto  Area  (City  of  Markham,  2014).  The  York  Regional  Official  Plan  (2010)   growth  forecast  anticipates  150,000  new  residents  and  100,000  new  jobs  in  Markham   between  2006  and  2031.  This  represents  one-quarter  of  the  Region's  population  growth   and  almost  on-third  of  it's  employment  growth  (York  Region,  2010).        Markham  has  two  Regional  Centres/Urban  Growth  Centres:  Markham  Centre  and   Langstaff  Gateway.  Markham  Centre  is  located  on  the  Highway  7  Rapid  Transit  Corridor   and  Langstaff  Gateway  is  part  of  the  Richmond  Hill/Langstaff  Gateway  Urban  Growth   Centre  along  the  Yonge  Street  Rapid  Transit  Corridor  (Figure  8).  Markham  Centre  is   planned  and  developed  as  Markham's  downtown,  with  a  high-density,  mixed  use   development  and  an  urban  character.  Langstaff  Gateway  is  subject  to  a  secondary  plan   and  is  planned  to  be  a  compact,  complete,  integrated  and  sustainable  community  (Town   of  Markham,  2009).  Both  of  these  Regional  Centres  are  planned  for  a  minimum  density   of  200  residents  and  jobs  per  hectare,  as  per  the  Urban  Growth  Centre  policies  of  the   Growth  Plan  (City  of  Markham,  2014).

Commercial  structure    
The  York  Region  Retail  Trends  Study  (2015)  identified  that  Markham  is  the  site  of  one   Super-Regional  retail  node,  three  Regional/Specialty  retail  nodes  and  seven  community   retail  nodes  (Figure  4).  Markville  Mall,  Markham's  super-regional  retail  node,  is   comprised  of  approximately  1.4  million  square  feet  of  retail  space,  while  the  three   Regional/Specialty  node  make  up  2.3  million  square  feet,  and  the  other  community   nodes  make  up  a  combined  1.2  million  square  feet.  Markham  is  also  home  to  three   historical  main  streets;  Markham  Main  Street,  Markham  Unionville  Main  Street  and   Thornhill  Main  Street  (York  Region,  2015).    

Commercial  Policy  Overview  1994-2016  
Official  Plan  Amendment  26  (1994)   In  1994,  Markham  commissioned  a  review  of  its  commercial  policies  by  Hemson   Consulting  and  John  Winter  Associates  and  updated  the  commercial  section  of  its   Official  Plan  (Town  of  Markham,  2004a).  Some  of  the  issues  that  prompted  this  review   included:  the  restructuring  of  the  commercial  sector  which  made  it  difficult  to  regulate   the  impact  of  "big  box"  development,  Official  Plan  policies  that  were  focused  on  market- based  retail  hierarchy,  lack  of  consistency  and  standardization  in  OP  policies  and   zoning  by-laws,  and  a  need  to  better  defined  the  "planned"  function  of  commercial  and   industrial  land  use  designations.  Official  Plan  Amendment  26  implemented  the  1994   Commercial  Uses  Study  recommended  changes.        These  changes  included:        Changing  the  policy  structure  to  better  reflect  Markham's  retail  activities      Providing  flexibility  to  commercial  land  to  commercial  land  use  categories      Consider  market  issues  only  if  they  impact  the  overall  commercial  structure  or   "planned  function"      Monitoring  changes  to  the  commercial  structure

   Official  Plan  Amendment  132  (2004)   Commercial  land  use  policies  were  reviewed  again  in  2004  by  John  Winter  Associates   (Town  of  Markham,  2004a).  Tate  Economic  Group  provided  a  peer  review  of  these   recommendations  (Town  of  Markham,  2005).        This  review  was  prompted  by  a  newly  elected  Council's  strategic  priorities,  which   included  "create  a  better  quality  community"  (Town  of  Markham,  2004b,  p.  3).  Under   this  objective,  the  Council  had  identified  actions  items  related  to  commercial   development:      Strive  to  develop  a  strong  sense  of  place  in  all  communities  in  Markham,  through   the  development  of  community  facilities  and  `walk  to'  commercial  centres  as  focal   points,  wherever  possible.      Pursue  small  neighbourhood  retail  focus/community  gathering  places,  in  central   locations,  in  those  new  communities  currently  needing  such  facilities  including   South  Unionville,  Berczy,  Legacy,  Wismer  and  Angus  Glen.      Shift  planning  policies  to  discourage  auto-oriented  big-box  retail  development   and  encourage  pedestrian  friendly  retail  activity  and  mixed  land  uses  at   community  focal  points  (Town  of  Markham,  2004b,  p.3).        The  commercial  land  use  review  addressed  several  challenges  that  the  Town  had  been   facing  related  to  commercial  development.  One  of  these  challenges  included  a  lack  of   neighbourhood  level  retail,  in  Community  Amenity  Areas  (CAAs),  a  commercial   designation  in  the  Official  Plan.  CAAs  were  meant  to  provide  a  basis  for  mixed  use   development  in  neighbourhoods,  by  allowing  small-scale  retail  and  office  uses  in   residential  neighbourhoods.  However,  most  of  these  sites  development  as  only   residential  or  only  retail  (Town  of  Markham,  2005).  The  Tate  Economic  Group  report   attributed  this  to  number  of  factors:  the  preference  for  residential  development  over   commercial  development  due  to  the  higher  value  of  residential  development  and  the   proficient  supply  of  retail  along  regional  roads  that  are  in  proximity  to  new  residential   development.  The  solution  recommended  was  to  mandate  neighbourhood  and   community  scale  commercial  uses  into  the  design  of  future  neighbourhoods  and  reserve   39     

   these  lands  for  commercial  uses  until  there  is  a  population  level  able  to  support   commercial  development  (Town  of  Markham,  2005).        Another  major  issue  discussed  was  the  prevalence  of  "big  box"  development  and  how  to   incorporate  this  development  into  the  city.  Big  box  development  was  seen  as  inevitable,   and  it  was  recommended  that  it  be  accommodated  at  suitable  locations  and  in   appropriate  forms  consistent  with  the  Town's  development  objectives.  Since  big  box   stores  compete  with  other  employment  uses  for  prime  locations,  it  was  argued  that  land   be  made  available  for  these  developments  to  that  they  are  not  competing  with  more   intensive  development  (Town  of  Markham,  2005).        Employment  Needs  Study  (2009)     In  2009,  a  report  on  Employment  Land  Needs  completed  by  urbanMetrics  and  Meridian   looked  into  commercial  land  needs  of  the  Town.  While  the  John  Winters  Associates   2004  report  suggested  that  additional  commercial  lands  would  be  needed  to  support   growth  beyond  2021,  this  analysis  was  seen  as  outdated  in  the  2009  Employment   Needs  report.  In  the  time  since  the  Winters  report,  there  had  been  a  policy  shift  and  the   Growth  Plan  (2006)  required  that  municipalities  direct  economic  activities  (including   retail)  to  areas  of  intensification.  On-going  issues  discussed  in  the  report  included  a  lack   of  retail  development  in  Community  Commercial  Areas  (CAAs)  and  big  box   development  (Town  of  Markham,  2009).        Encouraging  small-scale  commercial  uses  in  Community  Amenity  Areas  (CAAs)   continued  to  be  an  issue  for  the  Town,  as  the  majority  of  these  CAAs  were  being   development  with  only  residential  development.  The  report  recognized  that  a  policy   framework  supportive  of  mixed  use  is  not  enough  to  achieve  mixed  use  in  these   neighbourhoods,  if  there  is  no  market  to  support  commercial  or  retail  uses.  Many  of  the   neighbourhoods  where  CAAs  designations  existed  were  in  proximity  to  large,  well- established  retail  strips,  and  therefore  there  was  little  demand  for  additional  retail  in   those  neighbourhoods.     40     

   In  order  to  encourage  the  development  of  more  mixed-use  commercial  areas,  it  was   recommended  that  the  Town  actively  discourage  the  development  of  commercial  areas   that  are  devoted  exclusively  to  large  format  retail  uses  (Town  of  Markham,  2009).   While  the  market  for  big  box  developments  was  expected  to  continue  to  grow,  large- scale  retail  should  only  be  allowed  only  in  the  context  of  mixed  used  development.        Additional  recommendations  include:      To  cease  the  conversion  of  industrial  land  for  retail  uses,  given  the  shortfall  of   industrial  land  (the  2014  Provincial  Policy  Statement  only  allows  the  conversion   of  employment  land  after  a  Municipal  Comprehensive  Review).        To  only  consider  major  retail  facilities  once  it  has  been  determined  that  all   commercially  designated  sites  are  exhausted,  and  that  local-area  market   demand  patterns  indicate  a  need  for  new  retail  space.      To  refrain  from  expanding  the  commercial  land  supply  outside  the  current   settlement  area,  as  this  would  jeopardize  the  viability  of  existing  key  growth   nodes,  such  as  the  corridors  along  Highway  7  and  Yonge  Street  (Town  of   Markham,  2009)   Official  Plan  2014  (under  appeal)   The  2014  Official  Plan  sets  out  an  urban  structure  that  is  based  on  varying  levels  of   intensification  areas,  with  commercial  uses  integrated  within  other  uses  (City  of   Markham,  2014).        Markham's  priority  intensification  areas  include  lands  within  Regional  Centres  and  Key   Development  Areas  (KDA)  on  Regional  Corridors.  Key  Development  Areas  are  located   where  rapid  transit  services  intersect  with  major  nodes  of  retail  and  commercial   development  and  where  "opportunities  exist  for  redevelopment  of  large  land  parcels  that   support  new  public  streets  and  mixed-use  development"  (City  of  Markham,  2014,   Section  2.5.2).  These  Key  Development  Areas  are  identified  along  Yonge  Street  and   Highway  7  Rapid  Transit  Corridors  (Figure  8).        41     

   The  predominant  policy  themes  related  to  retail  focus  on  integrating  retail  into  new   mixed-use  developments  and  redeveloping  and  intensifying  existing  major  retail.      Integration  of  retail  into  the  community   ·   To  provide  for  the  integration  of  new  retail  and  service  uses  within  mixed-use   developments  on  lands  designated  "Mixed  Use"  (Section  5.1.7.2)      Intensification  and  redevelopment   ·   To  encourage  the  intensification  of  existing  single-use,  single-storey  retail  and   service  sites  within  the  `Mixed  Use'  designations  with  multi-use,  multi-storey   development,  while  ensuring  a  similar  retail  and  service  function  is  retained   (Section  5.1.7.3).        The  commercial  policies  in  the  2014  Official  Plan  reflect  a  clear  desire  to  move  away   from  power  retail  development  and  towards  mixed-use  and  compact  development.   Section  5.1.7.  of  it's  Official  Plan  states,  "in  the  future,  the  emphasis  will  be  to  move   away  from  large-format  retail  development  (single-use  retail  complexes  surrounded  by   large  surface  parking  lots)  towards  more  compact,  mixed-use  developments"  (City  of   Markham,  2014,  Section  5.1.7).    

Overview    
The  City  of  Markham  has  been  on  the  cutting  edge  of  suburban  intensification  and   mixed-use  community  planning  and  has  therefore  dedicated  considerable  attention  to   commercial  land  use  policy.  A  review  of  the  commercial  policy  over  the  past  two   decades  reveal  that  there  are  several  recurring  commercial  planning  issues  that  the  City   has  been  dealing  with,  namely  how  to  deal  with  the  undesirable  big  box  retail  format   and  how  to  provide  community  level  retail  in  new  communities.      A  review  of  the  various  commercial  land  use  reviews  that  the  City  has  commissioned   over  the  years  illuminates  the  evolution  in  thinking  about  how  to  plan  for  commercial   development.  From  Official  Plan  Amendment  26  to  the  policies  contained  City  of   42     

   Markham  2014  Official  Plan,  there  has  been  a  move  from  a  commercial  hierarchy  based   on  market  need,  to  a  commercial  hierarchy  based  on  "planned  function"  and  finally  an   "integrated"  approach  that  has  no  explicit  hierarchy.

Discussion      
Case  Study  Analysis  
In  order  to  analyze  the  evolution  of  commercial  land  use  planning,  policy  documents   relating  to  commercial  land  use  policy  were  reviewed  in  Vaughan,  Richmond  Hill  and   Markham.  Beyond  simply  reviewing  and  summarizing  these  policies,  content  analysis   was  conducted  in  order  to  identify  themes  and  patterns  in  these  policies.  This  analysis   revealed  six  different  themes  present  in  these  documents.  These  themes  were  identified   after  several  reviews  of  the  documents,  and  were  informed  by  background  research  on   commercial  retail  planning  in  Ontario,  as  well  as  the  policy  discussions  in  the   commercial  land  use  studies  which  informed  these  policies.  The  definitions  for  these   themes  are  provided  in  Table  1.

This  summary  reveals  some  patterns:   ·   Two  municipalities  (Vaughan  and  Richmond  Hill)  have  policies  that  emphasize   protection  of  the  commercial  hierarchy  pre-Growth  Plan,  but  do  not  have  these   policies  in  their  most  recent  Official  Plans.     ·   The  theme  of  intensification  and  redevelopment  is  only  addressed  in  post-Growth   Plan  Official  Plans.   ·   All  municipalities  address  a  wider  range  of  policy  themes  in  their  post-Growth   Plan  policies  than  were  present  in  their  previous  Official  Plans.            These  patterns  suggest  a  shifting  approach  to  retail  development,  in  order  to  meet  the   objectives  of  the  Growth  Plan  (2006).

Evolution  of  Commercial  Land-Use  Planning      
This  paper  aimed  to  describe  how  urbanizing  municipalities  in  York  Region  are   legislating  retail  development  in  an  effort  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Growth  Plan   (2006).  To  answer  this  question,  case  studies  were  conducted  on  three  municipalities   through  the  review  and  analysis  of  policy  documents  relating  to  commercial  land  use.   These  case  studies  have  revealed  that  municipalities  have  adopted  an  integrated   approach  to  land  use  planning  that  creates  a  hierarchy  of  density  within  the  municipality,   and  commercial  uses  are  treated  as  one  component  of  these  mixed-use  areas.          The  summary  of  themes  in  Table  2,  as  well  as  the  policy  discussions  present  in  the   case  studies,  reveal  an  evolution  in  thinking  about  how  to  plan  retail  for  communities.   Along  with  policies  regarding  housing  and  employment,  commercial  land  use  policies   have  changed  over  time  in  reflection  of  changing  ideas  about  the  role  of  land  use   planning  in  communities,  the  definition  of  what  a  healthy  community  looks  like  and  the   best  practices  in  how  to  implement  this  vision.        The  period  between  1995  and  2015  in  Ontario  covers  one  of  these  shifts,  the  shift   between  establishing  a  commercial  hierarchy  based  on  the  planned  function  of  a   commercial  area,  to  land  use  policies  that  emphasize  a  hierarchy  of  densities.  This   coincides  with  a  shift  in  the  planning  field  from  planning  for  separated  land  use  planning   (single-use)  to  planning  for  mixed-uses,  as  well  as  the  disruption  of  the  commercial   46     

   hierarchy  ideal  by  new  forms  retail,  namely  power  retail.  This  shift  is  illustrated  by  the   themes  that  are  present  in  respective  policy  documents,  specifically  the  disappearance   of  the  commercial  hierarchy  in  post-Growth  Plan  (2006)  Official  Plans,  and  the   emphasis  on  intensification  and  redevelopment  (see  Table  2).          The  commercial  land  use  studies  are  particularly  useful  for  insight  into  the  planning   rationales  which  informed  commercial  land  use  policy  decisions.  By  comparing  the   policies  of  the  three  municipal  case  studies  at  different  points  in  time,  these  shifts  in   planning  rationale  become  apparent.  This  begins  with  the  review  of  Markham's   commercial  land  use  policy  review  completed  in  1994,  in  which  recommended  that   Markham  move  away  from  policies  that  were  focused  on  a  "market-based"  retail   hierarchy  and  instead  define  the  "planned  function"  commercial  and  industrial  land  use   designations  (Town  of  Markham.  2004a).        This  "planned  function"  approach  to  commercial  land  use  planning  can  be  found  in  the   pre-Growth  Plan  Official  Plans  in  Vaughan,  Richmond  Hill  and  Markham.  In  these   Official  Plans,  a  hierarchy  is  established  based  on  the  servicing  needs  of  residents.  For   example,  the  Vaughan's  OPA  600  categorizes  different  designations  based  on  the   "weekly  needs"  (Neighbourhood  Commercial  Centres)  or  "daily  convenience  needs"   (Local  Convenience  Centres)  of  the  surrounding  neighbourhood  (City  of  Vaughan,   2001).  In  Richmond  Hill,  Official  Plan  Amendment  129  established  a  hierarchy  of   commercial  uses  based  on  the  area  that  the  commercial  development  is  meant  to   service.  For  example,  Neighbourhood  Commercial  Areas  are  primarily  intended  to  serve   the  needs  of  one  or  more  planning  districts,  while  Regional  Commercial  areas  serve  the   needs  of  the  entire  Town  and  a  portion  of  York  Region  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  1998).   Similarly,  the  City  of  Markham  defined  the  planned  function  of  a  commercial  designation   based  on  who  the  use  was  serving  (the  local  neighbourhood,  the  municipality  or  the   broader  region)  (Town  of  Markham,  1995).        The  "integrated"  land  use  approach  is  adopted  by  Vaughan,  Richmond  Hill  and   Markham  in  their  most  recent  Official  Plans.  This  approach  is  described  in  the   Commercial  Needs  study  conducted  by  Hemson  Consulting  for  the  Town  of  Richmond   47     

   Hill  in  2009.    The  "integrated  approach"  essentially  means  combining  a  mix  of  uses  in   the  same  building  or  node,  rather  than  the  establishing  a  hierarchy  based  on  "single   uses"  like  the  "planned  function"  approach.  The  report  refers  to  this  as  an  "emerging   model  in  retail  commercial  planning"  (Town  of  Richmond  Hill,  2009b,  p.  25).          The  "integrated"  approach  is  evident  in  all  three  case  studies  most  recent  Official  Plans.   The  urban  structure  established  in  these  plans  is  based  on  a  hierarchy  of  mixed-use   intensification  areas,  and  commercial  uses  are  one  of  the  permitted  uses  in  these  areas.    

Power  Retail    
Existing  research  on  power  retail  has  argued  that  it  has  been  a  disruptive  force  to  the   existing  commercial  hierarchy.  Planners  had  been  establishing  commercial  hierarchies   based  on  their  planned  function,  with  commercial  development  designated  to  serve  a   specific  market.  Planners'  objective  is  to  maintain  controlled  commercial  competition   within  a  commercial  hierarchy  has  been  undermined  by  retail  locations  in  distant   locations,  including  other  jurisdictions  (Hernandez  and  Simmons,  2006).      These  case  studies  have  provided  some  insight  into  how  power  retail  has  influenced   commercial  land  use  planning  in  the  Greater  Toronto  Area.  One  of  the  key  findings  of  is   that  power  retail,  or  "big  box"  retail  has  been  an  issue  that  municipalities  have  been   concerned  with  for  at  least  the  past  twenty  years  (1995-2015).  All  of  the  commercial   land  use  policy  reviews  conducted  over  this  twenty-year  time  period  discussed  how  to   manage  power  retail  development.  Two  of  the  three  municipalities  (Vaughan  and   Markham)  have  been  planning  for  mixed-use  commercial  development,  in  some   capacity,  since  the  1990s.        Therefore,  the  Official  Plans  updated  to  comply  with  the  Growth  Plan  represent  a   renewed  effort  to  facilitate  mixed-use,  compact  commercial  developments.  In  all  three   case  studies,  post-Growth  Plan  policies  regarding  commercial  development  indicate  a   clear  desire  to  facilitate  the  intensification  and  redevelopment  of  existing  power  retail.  In  

48     

   order  to  facilitate  this  intensification  and  redevelopment,  these  areas  have  been   designated  as  Intensification  areas  or  Key  Development  Areas.        The  City  of  Vaughan  directs  new  retail  to  intensification  areas  and  encourages  the   intensification  of  existing  developments.  The  Official  Plan  section  related  to  retail   development,  entitled  "Supporting  and  Transforming  the  Retail  Sector",  directs  that   "existing  standalone  shopping  centres  will  be  permitted  to  transform  into  mixed-use   buildings  and  districts  that  incorporate  residential,  office  and  institutional  uses"  (City  of   Vaughan,  2010,  Section  5.2.3).        The  Town  of  Richmond  Hill  and  the  City  of  Markham  both  designate  much  of  their   existing  power  retail  as  Key  Development  areas,  which  are  defined  as  location  where   rapid  transit  services  intersect  with  major  nodes  of  retail  and  commercial  development   and  where  there  are  opportunities  for  the  redevelopment  of  large  land  parcels  (Town  of   Richmond  Hill,  2010,  Section  4.4;  City  of  Markham,  2014,  Section  5.1.7).  It  is  clear  that   municipalities  expect  that  much  of  the  power  retail  located  along  rapid  transit  corridors,   and  within  Regional  Centres  will  eventually  redevelopment  due  to  rising  land  values  in   these  areas  due  investment  in  transit  and  greater  permissions  for  density.    

Recommendations      
In  order  to  assist  municipalities  in  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  Growth  Plan  (2006),   the  following  actions  are  recommended  to  the  provincial  government:      1)   Consult  with  municipalities  and  developers  to  gain  insight  into  the  challenges  of   planning  for  compact,  mixed-use  commercial  development.        Municipalities  plan  for  commercial  development  with  little  direction  from  the  provincial   government  and  there  exists  a  variety  of  approaches  that  municipalities  could  take   towards  commercial  development.  Therefore,  the  province  should  consult  with   municipalities  in  order  to  gain  insight  into  the  challenges  faced  in  planning  for  more   compact,  mixed-use  commercial  development.  For  example,  the  commercial  land  use   49     

   studies  conducted  in  Markham  illustrated  that  the  City  of  Markham  has  been  planning   for  small-scale,  mixed  use  commercial  development  in  its  residential  neighbourhoods   for  the  past  twenty  years.  However,  very  little  of  this  type  of  development  has  occurred   due  to  market  conditions  that  favor  residential  development.        2)   Expand  policy  tools  outside  of  land  use  policy  in  order  to  encourage  compact,   mixed-use  commercial  development.        The  case  studies  demonstrated  that  these  municipalities  have  developed  a  strong  policy   framework  that  encourages  compact,  mixed  use  development.  However,  as  suggested   in  the  York  Region  Retail  Needs  Study,  a  strong  policy  framework  alone  is  not  sufficient   for  achieving  this  urban  form.  There  are  number  of  market  conditions  that  discourage   mixed-use,  compact  development  in  York  Region,  including  an  auto-oriented   transportation  network  and  the  continued  availability  of  greenfield  sites  for  development   (York  Region,  2015).  While  the  province  and  municipalities  are  addressing  these   underlying  conditions  through  investments  in  transit  infrastructure  and  land  use  policies   that  restrict  greenfield  development,  it  will  likely  take  decades  for  these  policies  to  shift   market  conditions  in  York  Region.          In  the  interim,  the  province  should  consider  exploring  policy  tools  outside  of  land  use   policy,  such  as  financial  incentives,  that  could  support  these  objectives.  This  could   include  expanding  upon  existing  tools  provided  to  municipalities,  such  as  Community   Improvement  Plans,  deferral  of  development  charges,  bonusing  and  development   permit  systems.  These  financial  incentives  could  jump-start  key  projects  in  high-profile   centres  and  corridors,  demonstrating  to  the  development  industry  that  denser  mixed- use  developments  are  viable  and  achievable  in  urban  areas  like  York  Region.        3)   Provide  further  direction  for  planning  commercial  development.        The  Growth  Plan  for  the  Greater  Golden  Horseshoe  (2006)  directs  municipalities  to  plan   for  complete  communities  which  have  "a  diverse  mix  of  land  uses,  a  range  and  mix  of   employment  and  housing  types,  high  quality  public  open  space  and  easy  access  to  local   50     

   stores  and  services"  (Province  of  Ontario,  2006,  13).  After  analyzing  how  commercial   land  use  policies  have  evolved  over  the  past  twenty  years,  it  is  clear  that  there  is  less   emphasis  on  commercial  areas  as  a  service,  and  more  attention  placed  on  their  built   character  and  density.  In  contrast,  much  more  attention  is  paid  to  the  service  role  of   housing  and  employment  development  at  the  provincial  and  municipal  level.        This  approach  to  planning  for  commercial  development  ignores  the  important  role   commercial  services  play  in  Ontario  municipalities,  in  terms  of  place-making,   transportation  planning  and  economic  development.  Additionally,  planning  for   commercial  uses  will  likely  become  even  more  important  to  local  and  regional   economies  as  service-related  employment  continue  to  grow.  The  recommendations   provided  by  the  Advisory  Panel  for  the  Coordinated  Review  of  the  provincial  land  use   plans  recognize  that  this  shift  will  impact  planning  to  economic  development  (Province   of  Ontario,  2015).        In  order  to  achieve  the  objective  of  complete  communities,  the  province  should  provide   direction  on  commercial  land  use  planning  that  considers  the  service  role  of  commercial   development.  This  coordination  could  take  on  a  variety  of  forms.  Most  importantly,  the   province  should  explain  what  "easy  access"  to  stores  and  services  looks  like  in  high,   medium  and  low-density  urban  areas.  This  could  take  the  form  of  a  service-level   standard  or  guidelines  on  how  to  integrate  commercial  uses  to  meet  the  commercial   needs  of  communities,  along  with  transportation,  employment  and  housing  needs.
