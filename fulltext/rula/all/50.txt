This paper presents a case study of the ergonomic consequences of engineering change. Within the context of a project to re-design an electronics assembly system a decision was made to automate transportation functions. A manual batch-cart system was changed to a line-system with automatic conveyors. Video analysis of the old and new systems were made and subsequently analysed using a computerised video observation system. These data were combined with production system data obtained from company records and by informal interviews with key informants in the organisation. Detailed examinations of the manual assembly workstations were made as these were most directly affected by the new conveyance system. The data indicate that the new assembly work has decreased variability of work tasks, decreased cycle time and time available per component insertion, has elements of machine pacing, and decreased available interactions with co-workers. These indicators imply poorer physical working conditions in the new system. This decrease has occurred despite the active involvement of an ergonomics team in the re-design process. The decision to implement the line system resulted from a corporate strategy to increase levels of automation and was made without input from the ergonomics group. The results of this study suggest that corporate strategy, and subsequent production system design decisions have important implications for ergonomic conditions in the resulting system. Once made, the decision to adopt the line transportation system provided design constraints that could not be entirely overcome by the ergonomics team. Joint-optimisation, through integrated consideration of technical and ergonomic constraints, is necessary to design optimal production systems.

· Many Risk Factors Known (eg Bernard 1997 - NIOSH) · 4% Gross World Product in ill health (WHO:ILO 1998)
­ ~40% WMSDs

· Drive to Increase productivity & Intensification? · Production Strategies Related to Ill Health
­ ­ ­ ­ `Downsizing' (Vahtera et al . 1997) `Lean Manufacturing' (Landsbergis et al. 1999) `Repetitive Industrial Work' (Norlund et al. 2000) Line systems (Fredriksson et al. 2001, Ólafsdóttir & Rafnsson 1986)

Theoretical Framework
Can we identify the sources of WMSD risk factors in production system design strategies?

Automation of Assembly
· Manual work  · save 2.6 min / board · machine supervision · Workstation cost

Line Automation Strategy
Batch Transport System: 1) Assembly 2) Transport Serial Line System: 1) Assembly 2) Assembly

ERGONOMICS ·  total operator time in stereotyped tasks ·  variable supervision work (reaching?) · NO (direct) change in Manual Assembly · BUT... unanticipated consequences ...
National Institute for Working Life

· Less `non-value added' work ·  W.I.P. ·  Disturbances & Losses ·  cycle times (no framing) · Difficult to expand

· Less task variety · Machine Pacing ·  Frustration from disturb. · Increased average shoulder load = Intensification (workstation level)
National Institute for Working Life

Workstation Design Strategy
Constraints from tech. team: · Conveyor pathway & space · Line rate & tasks · Number of parts (increased) · 1st rack elevates parts above transport system ( load) · 2nd rack added for failed automation parts ( load)

Strategy: Work Organisation
· USED: Partial rotation, unstructured · Some operators had `specialised' jobs (hi variability) · Work Org. team planned rotation to balance load · New manager rejected Work Org Strategy
­ Temporary operators being used
· Could be eliminated with further automation · Didn't warrant investing in multiskilling (?)

· Adjustable `Ergonomic' workstation (sit-stand capability): - expensive & not used much - does not change essential shoulder demands

 Operators' workload unevenly distributed

Case Study Illustrates Linkages to Injury
Production system level Injury Pathway Corporate Strategy System Design Production System Workstation level Risk Factors
1) Decided to improve performance with automation 2) Process considered ergonomics separately 1) Technology choices for line system created constraints for workstation design. 1) Faster cycles & improved productivity 2) Uneven distribution of tasks 1) Reduced Work Variability ( intensity) 2) Increased shoulder loading

Case Study Conclusions
1. Productivity and Ergonomic objectives coincided in automating repetitive assembly work (workforce level) but...
- Unanticipated problems in automation constrained workstation design with negative ergonomic consequences

2. Productivity and ergonomics were in conflict in the automation of transport work 3. Strategic decision makers and engineers set early constraints for operator physical loading
