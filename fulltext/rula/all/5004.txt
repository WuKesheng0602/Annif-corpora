Abstract
DEVELOPMENT OF UAV DERIVATIVE MDO METHODOLOGY FOR FLIGHT SIMULATION

Ohyun Kwon Master of Applied Science Department of Aerospace Engineering Ryerson University 2016

An integrated methodology for the design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) derivative has been developed. The proposed methodology utilized the Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) for the derivative optimization and utilized flight simulation for virtual flight tests. Derivative design reduced the development time and the use of flight simulator allowed quick verification of the results. In this research, Found Aircraft Expedition E350 aircraft was selected as the baseline for the UAV derivative. Empirical equations were used for the optimization process where the results were organized for easy transformation into a flight simulation model. An in house program was developed to convert raw simulation data for flight-data analysis. The optimization result yielded an improvement on the endurance of the aircraft. The flight simulation result for the original aircraft demonstrated agreement with the chosen aircraft. The application of the process demonstrated that using MDO and flight simulation was a viable method for developing a UAV derivative.

Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 Research Motivation
The modern aircraft design process has often relied highly on past designs, or derivative designs [1]. Extensive information on how to design an airplane accumulated throughout aviation history. Engineers designed and built aircraft using existing historical resources; however, the design method was different for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Engineers lacked information due to the UAVs short heritage. To overcome this problem, a possible method was to use the base design of an existing aircraft and then optimize it to meet certain requirements, instead of creating a new design. This derivative design process had certain advantages over conventional design, which was explained in section 1.3. Once the development of a UAV was completed, a verification process was essential to confirm that all requirements were satisfied. However, it was physically impossible to commence real flight tests because researchers did not own an actual 1

aircraft. Nevertheless, the use of flight simulation allowed researchers to perform virtual flight tests in any circumstance. The essence of this thesis was the integration of the derivative design and virtual flight test, while utilizing Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) and flight simulation simultaneously. Section 1.4 explains the objective of the thesis in detail.

1.2 UAV History
The concept of a UAV dates back to the 19th century. Douglas Archibald from England was one of the pioneers of aerial photography, using a camera-attached kite [2]. Although some may dispute that a kite is not technologically sophisticated enough to be classified as UAV, it is unmanned, generates aerodynamic forces and had some type of control just like a UAV. In modern days, a UAV was defined as an aircraft, which was intended to operate with no pilot on board. In the big picture, there were mainly two types of UAV: autonomous controlled aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft [3]. The development of UAV had taken its root from military applications like many other modern technologies. In the early 1900s, Montgomery Low developed the first data link system, and had a successful radio controlled flight in 1924. Soon after, the United States Air Force started using UAVs as a target drones. The OQ-3 a derivative of OQ-2 seen on Figure 1.1 was one of the most famous target drone of the age and over 9000 units served during the World War II [4].

Figure 1.1 OQ-2 by Radioplane [5]

Meanwhile, the autonomous UAV was developed using gyroscopes as the guidance control. All of the autonomous UAV at the time were used as bombs, because there was no way to change its path of it after the launch. The similarity between early UAVs was that it served a single sortie for their entire lifespan. The concept of recovering the UAV for multiple missions arose decades after. In the early 1960s, the military elites of the United States began seriously researching UAVs. The highly classified products of this research were deployed in the skies of Vietnam [6]. The value of the UAVs went up as the missions they had undertaken were far more complex than those from earlier days. Recovering the UAV after its mission was crucial as it stored the data retrieved from its reconnaissance mission. The main recovery system used was a parachute and once the vehicle slowed down after parachute deployment, a helicopter specifically made for recovery missions recovered it. This efficient method had a 90% of success rates during the war [7]. After the terrorist attacks of the September 11, 2001, the UAV industry took big strides forward with the introduction of attacking UAVs, along with reconnaissance UAVs [8]. Around the same time, `Civil Applications and Economical efficiency of potential UAV Configuration ' (CAPECON) program of Europe had a vision of a growing market in the civilian sector. Their vision was "Within 10 years UAVs will be operated within civilian airspace on behalf of many civilian & commercial missions" [9]. Throughout the decade, researches tried to find various civil missions for UAVs. As a result, civilian UAVs started to tackle scientific, public safety and commercial tasks as seen on the table in Appendix A [10]. However, UAVs were still used most in military applications [11]. This was mostly because of the cost to develop UAV was very high. Companies or organizations would not invest into a market where the growth or the potential of

3

the market was not certain. Moreover, there was no concrete regulations on UAVs. No regulation leads to a lack of standards, leading to confusion for the manufactures, and investors. It was only in recent years that civilian companies showed interest in UAVs, focusing their investments on multicopters and smaller drones as seen on Figure 1.2 [12].

Figure 1.2 Example of commercial and civil UAV [13]

1.3 Derivative Design
When a demand grows in a new market sector there were two ways to meet the market demands; developing a completely new design, or developing a derivative design rooting off from the existing design, while keeping the development time and cost to a minimum [14]. Developing a derivative had cost and time advantage because it shared many components with the base aircraft. In addition, a base aircraft that the derivative was designed from were already certified. This eases the certification process of the derivative, depending on what type of changes were done. 4

Diamond Aircraft's DA42 has numerous derivative designs to suit different flying environment and missions as seen on Figure 1.3.

Figure 1.3 Derivatives of Diamond aircraft's DA42 [15]

The original DA42 was a four seat, twin engine, propeller-driven airplane, suited for casual flight. DA42 Guardian was specifically developed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions, with decreased fuel consumption and decreased cruising speed. DA42 Geostar was another derivation developed for geo survey and mapping equipped with laser-scanner and high-resolution camera. Both DA42 Guardian and DA42 Geostar were developed to be an Optionally Piloted Vehicle (OPV). Finally, DA42 Dominator was a medium altitude long endurance UAV developed by Aeronautics Defense System in Israel. It had even longer endurance with higher maximum altitude [15].

1.4 Research Objective
The objective of this thesis is to introduce a new approach to develop a civil UAV. This approach includs the transformation of a civil light aircraft into a UAV derivative using the MDO method. The optimized model was created in a flight simulator to perform various virtual flight tests in a simulated environment. In this thesis, the Found aircraft's Expedition E350 was optimized into a UAV derivative to carry out a cargo mission. Light aircraft costs were comparably cheaper than similar sized UAVs in the market, while having similar performance compared to the UAVs. Some of the Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) were a fraction of the cost of the UAVs with similar performance. Furthermore, these aircraft were certified for piloted use, which ensures the integrity of the aircraft. Since it was designed for piloted use, the payload it could carry was significantly higher than airframes developed strictly for a UAV. More allowable payload meant flexibility on the carried equipment and fuel quantity.

1.5 Thesis Outline
This thesis consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the research motivation and objective along with a brief introduction of the history of the UAV along with the description of derivative design. Chapter 2 introduces the theory of MDO and different methods of MDO. It briefly introduced and compared the typical optimization algorithms used: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Chapter 3 explaines the flight simulation portion of the thesis. Starting with a brief history of flight simulation, this chapter focused heavily on the flight simulation system and a detailed review on the building process of Ryerson Fixed Base Simulator. At the end of the chapter, two commercially available flight simulators were compared. Chapter 4 explaines the methodologies introduced in this thesis. This includes the entire process starting from the optimization to virtual flight test. This chapter also explains how the flight data6

retrieving program worked in detail. Chapter 5 exhibits the application of the previous chapters. A chosen aircraft went through the entire process of derivative design, virtual flight tests and flight data analysis. Chapter 6 presents the result from the optimization and virtual flight tests, with discussions. Chapter 7 completes the thesis with conclusion and future works.

Chapter 2 Multidisciplinary Design Optimization

2.1 MDO Methods
The act of seeking the best possible result under a given circumstance is the definition of optimization. The practice of optimization is undertaken in our daily lives as we pursuit excellence for tasks we do even if we do not realize it [16]. In terms of mathematics, the optimization process is a very old technique of calculus where extreme values of simple functions are calculated. MDO, in contrast, is a methodology that optimized a problem with multiple disciplines simultaneously thus utilized by many researchers [17-19]. To design an aircraft properly, an engineer must consider disciplines such as aerodynamics, structures, weight, balance, stability and control simultaneously, to achieve best possible result. MDOs characteristics made it a popular

8

optimization methodology in aircraft optimization because it can handle complex multidisciplinary-coupled problems well [20]. MDO methods can be divided into two big categories: single level and multilevel. In single level optimization, the system optimizer determines both the disciplinary and system design variables. In multilevel optimization, disciplinary optimizers determines the disciplinary design variables and the system optimizer determines the system design variables.

2.1.1 Single Level Methods
2.1.1.1 Multi-Discipline Feasible (MDF) The MDF is a simple MDO method that consisted of a system with a single global optimizer and various subsystems [21,22]. All of the variables came from the system and were distributed to the various sub systems. Here a subspace analysis was used and then the outputs were sent back to the system level for analysis and optimization. In addition, this method requires coupling variables to exchange between the various disciplines. The only disadvantage to this type of MDO method was that the solution of a system could be very costly due to the lack of system level optimization.

Figure 2.1 Basic MDF architecture [27]

9

2.1.1.2 Individual Discipline Feasible (IDF) Individual Discipline Feasible while similar to MDF had a few differences that made it more complicated, but could decrease computation time. This method allowed the optimizer to optimize individual disciplines by controlling the interdisciplinary design variables [23]. Simply the coupling variables were treated as optimization variables because unlike the MDF method, the IDF method is decoupled [24].

Figure 2.2 Basic IDF architecture [27]

2.1.1.3 All At Once (AAO) As the name suggests this method computed all of the tasks at once. Specifically this method solves the governing equations within each discipline and optimizes the problem at the same time. This method can be used for multi or single discipline problems. It can be very efficient however, it is not considered because it is based off the IDF method [25].

2.1.2 Multilevel Methods
2.1.2.1 Concurrent Sub-Space Optimization (CSSO) The CSSO method is a non-hierarchic system optimization that optimized subspaces simultaneously. Once the subspaces are analysed and optimized the results went to an organization procedure where the system was directed towards convergence of the problem and resolving 10

subspace conflicts. The subspaces within the CSSO acts as their own system level analysis, where the non-local variables were approximated using various global sensitivity analysis equations [24]. While this method does decrease the amount of computation power necessary to solve the system, it does make the setup and formulation of the system very complex [26].

Figure 2.3 Basic CSSO architecture [27]

2.1.2.2 Bi-Level Integrated System Synthesis (BLISS) BLISS is a MDO method that has a hierarchal structure which provides each discipline with a certain level of autonomy. It relies heavily on the use of coupled sensitivities. The main process consist of analyzing the system, analyzing the subsystems, performing a system sensitivity analysis, optimizing the subsystems and finally performing a second system sensitivity analysis and optimization. The process to set up and solve a BLISS analysis is complex [24]. However,

11

once the system is set up it will require few design variables and a low amount of computation power [26].

Figure 2.4 Basic BLISS architecture [27]

2.1.2.3 Collaborative Optimization (CO) Collaborative Optimization (CO) is a two level hierarchal MDO method. This method is considered a relatively simple multilevel MDO method. It consist of one system level optimizer followed by the subsequent subspace optimization. Each subspace shares variables with the other subspaces and the system. The process consist of sending the system variable from the system level down to the subspaces where it optimizes with respect to its own variables and constraints. The subspace then sends the variables back to the system for further optimization and for passing it to other subspaces. This type of design process is useful for situations where the number of disciplinary variables is higher than the number of interdisciplinary variables. Thus, if the

12

disciplines have less coupling, this method will be beneficial. One drawback of this method however, is that it will consume a lot of computation resource due to its high number of necessary function calls [26].

Figure 2.5 Basic CO architecture [27]

2.1.3 Method Selection
Researchers selected two test cases to compare the above MDO methods. Methods were compared in five categories, however AAO method was not considered because of its similarity with the IDF method [27]. The first test case was an analytical example and the second test case was aircraft conceptual design. In the first example, a sample mathematical function was minimized under given constraint [28]. In the second example, a supersonic business jet was optimized to achieve maximum range [29]. Table 2.1 shows the result, `good' to `bad' from top to bottom.

The accuracy represents the result accuracy of each methods. The efficiency represents the computational efficiency, or how quickly the solution was reached. Transparency represents how easily the method could be implied to the optimization problem. Similarly, simplicity represents how quickly the method can be implied to the optimization problem. Finally, portability represents how easily the method can be adapted directly to existing organizational structures. For this thesis, the MDF method was chosen. It has the highest accuracy, transparency, and simplicity. Efficiency was not a big concern because the problem solved in this thesis was not computationally demanding, and converged rapidly. Portability was not important because once the optimization problem was established, it did not require much changes.

2.2 Optimization Algorithms
Optimization algorithms are methodical sets of calculations, which aims to find the best solution to a set of parameters to minimize or maximize an objective function while meeting a specific set of constraints and boundaries [16]. In this thesis, two algorithms were studied then one was chosen to be used for actual application. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. It is capable of solving optimization problem with discrete variables. It is also capable of finding the global minimum. However, it takes long time to find the global solution and the search for an absolute solution is not guaranteed [30,31]. Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is one of the most efficient gradient-based algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization problem. It quickly converges to an optimal solution. However it can not solve any problem with discrete variables and there are no guarantee that the solution was the global minimum [30,31].

2.2.1 Algorithm Selection
Five test runs were conducted for each algorithm, using the UAV optimization similar to the one formulated in Chapter 5. Tests were run with the same initial condition as seen on Table 2.2; the only difference was the algorithm used to solve the problem. The GA result showed some discrepancy between the tests as seen on Table 2.3. Average time to converge was 358.14 seconds. This phenomenon happens because the GA uses random sampling methods to create generations of random candidate. So each time the optimization is performed, the algorithm takes different paths to reach the optimized solution. On the other hand, the SQP result showed no discrepancy between the tests, as seen on Table 2.4. Average time to converge was 9.53 seconds.

2.3 Verification of the MDO method
After finalizing the formulation of the optimization code, it was verified by running the optimization problem and comparing the results with already existing works. Researchers had studied the sample optimization problem chosen for their verification process [32,33]. This problem optimizes a simple two-bar truss, where each bar element had tubular cross section.

Figure 2.7 Two bar truss schematics

The objective of the optimization was minimizing the total weight of the structure while satisfying the constraints in equation (4) and (5). Table 2.6 and Table 2.7 list the constants, design variables, boundaries, and requirements. The problem was formulated using MDF method. The solver used the SQP algorithm.

Chapter 3 Flight Simulation

This chapter covers a brief history of flight simulation software and flight simulators. Literature studies were done on two subjects related to the flight simulation. The first subject focused on the hardware, studying how other institutes were utilizing the flight simulators. The second subject focused on the software and application, studying how other institutes and researchers utilized the flight simulation. This chapter also describes the development of the Ryerson Fixed Base Simulator (RFBS) in detail, in terms of its validity, manufacturing methods and the system specification. Finally, a decision making process was performed to choose the most suitable flight simulation software for this thesis.

3.1 History
As with any other technology, the 1900s was the century where flight simulation went through great leaps of technological improvements. Of them all, the most remarkable improvement 19

was gained on 1970s with an introduction of microprocessors [34]. Microprocessors enhanced the performance of the flight simulator with improved computation efforts. The main purpose of the flight simulator was to train the pilots. Many of them were very sophisticated, and allowed to be used to log flight hours [35]. In recent years, flight simulators were used more than just to train pilots. Aircraft manufacturers and researchers used flight simulators to design and test during the aircraft development stage [36-39]. Aircraft simulation was also used in plane crashes or emergency investigations using the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The data recorded in the FDR was animated using a flight simulator. Usually the FDR included important factors such as the velocity, heading, thrust, angle of each control surface and more. Using these essential data, the flight simulator was able to simulate a virtual world, making it easier for the investigator to understand what was actually happening to the plane. Additionally, enhanced computing power and high fidelity analysis models were developed and utilized for the virtual certification [40].

3.2 Literature Survey
Nowadays, Human Machine Interface (HMI) units and computation units make up flight simulators as seen on Figure 3.1. The human interface units interacted with the user as the control input and feedback system. The computational units solves aircraft equations of motions and other mathematical models. This was the backbone of modern flight simulator, despite the fact that this concept was established decades ago [41].

20

Figure 3.1 Typical composition of a flight simulation system

Renowned universities such as Georgia Institute of Technology and University of Toronto own multi-purpose high fidelity simulators. Utilizing in-house programs, they were used as a tool for various research projects such as solving time delays in visually coupled systems during simulation [42] and developing new software architectures [43]. More literature survey showed that researchers from around the world developed various flight simulators to be used as training tools for engineers and pilots, and as engineering tools [44,45]. Some of these were mission specific simulators focusing on icing studies [46]. Others developed flight simulator to educate engineers [47]. Finally, the Test and Evaluation Modeling and Simulation (TEMS) facility at Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Edwards Air Force Base built realistic cockpit simulators to study the relation between the reconfigurability and fidelity of the simulator [48].

3.3 Application
For Ryerson University, the necessity of the flight simulator arose from gathering flight data for aircraft design studies. Flight data were proprietary information of a manufacturing company or an airline, making it costly and difficult to acquire for academic purposes. Flight simulation integrated with data generation solved this problem. Flight simulation allowed

21

researchers to recreate any flight situation, anywhere, anytime. Training the pilots and engineers was another important role of a flight simulator In addition to the data generation. To enhance the quality of training it was necessary for the simulator to replicate the cockpit environment and avionics as much as possible.

3.3.1 The RFBS
The Mixed-reality Immersive Motion Simulator (MIMS) Facility housed the Ryerson Fixed-Base Simulator (RFBS) and the Ryerson Full-Motion Simulator (RFMS). The RFBS focused on the accurate data generation and cockpit representation. The RFMS focused on the motion and dynamics of an aircraft, creating opportunities to study human factors in a motion environment. The RFBS focused on combining all the positive factors and minimizing the negative factors of already existing flight simulators. While many previous engineering flight simulators focused on computation and data communication than the cockpit environment. The RFBS (Figure 3.2) is a true multi-purpose simulator because it integrates all aspects of flight simulation, flight data generation, and the data analysis system [49].

Figure 3.2 Factors considered for RFBS [49]

22

A multi-purpose simulator is also very cost-effective, as it is too costly to purchase multiple simulators for different purposes. Advancement in computing power also allows single system to handle multiple simulating features. Academically, multi-purpose simulators can be used to educate the students about avionics and flight dynamics . The RFBS' reconfigurability is achieved by replacing hardware buttons with touch screens; it can virtually simulate any aircraft. 3.3.1.1 Design and build of the simulator Five main components of a flight simulator included visual, audio, avionics, flight control, and motion components [50]. Visual and audio were feedbacks from the simulator while flight controls were inputs into the simulator. Avionics serve as both input and feedback as the pilot was required to input commands and see the aircraft status through it. Motion was disregarded, as the RFBS was a fixed-base simulator. After several design phases shown on Figure 3.3, the simulator's rendering was complete as seen on Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.3 Design phases of the RFBS

23

Figure 3.4 CATIA model of the RFBS

As seen on Figure 3.5, the final design of the RFBS included three 46" screens as main visualization and six 22" touch screens as an instrument panel, where the overhead panel used two of them. The pilot seat on the left hand side was equipped with a rudder pedal and a yoke, and the right hand side was equipped with a rudder pedal and a joystick. This configuration allowed to simulate both Boeing and Airbus aircraft with more realistic feelings. The throttle lever was located on the centre console, easily reachable by both pilots. Entire structure including the base, centre console and overhead panel was built by pre-cut aluminum extrusion.

Figure 3.5 Completed RFBS, front view

3.3.1.2 System configuration The RFBS utilized two computers; one handled the visualization, computation and flight data generation while the other handled the flight control input and instrument panel. Both computers must be on in order for the RFBS to run on its full capability. A Local Area Network (LAN) data cable connected the computers, allowing real time communication as seen on Figure 3.6. Hardware configurations for each computer were listed on Table 3.1.

3.3.2 Choice of Flight Simulation Program
Since a flight simulator was a basic platform of this thesis, it was important to find the right software to work with. Following criteria was considered: Physics: Chosen flight simulator must be able to represent real world physics accurately, from the motion of the aircraft to the physics of the environment (wind etc.) Data Extraction: Chosen flight simulator must be able to provide the user with the data required Visual Representation: Chosen flight simulator must be able to visualize the accurate behaviour of the aircraft as the user inputs a command. Rendering quality will not be a main concern Availability: Chosen flight simulator must enable user to access its full capability

Although there were numerous flight simulators out there, the lab had full access to only two commercial flight simulators available to the public: X-Plane from Laminar Research and the Flight Simulator X (FSX) from Microsoft. Taking into account the abovementioned criteria, the simulation software was chosen.

26

3.3.2.1 Microsoft's Flight Simulator X Microsoft's FSX was the tenth flight simulator the company had developed. After the FSX, Microsoft had cancelled the programming and discontinued its series. In the FSX, an aircraft's flight was represented by calculating predetermined aerodynamic properties that were compiled in a file. Therefore, the behavior of the aircraft was calculated with the user input, virtual world conditions, and pre-set properties from the file. This allowed any object to fly in FSX, as long as its data properties were compiled as a flyable object even when it was physically unable to fly. FSX provided a built in function called 'Flight Analysis' to analyze an already flown aircraft. This provided essential information such as the global position, altitude, heading and airspeed of the aircraft along with the actual path of the aircraft on the map. The user could slide the time slider to adjust the flight phase, and the data would change to the corresponding time set. Unfortunately, it was impossible for the user to extract these data to be used externally from the FSX with simple maneuver. The FSX provided a stunning visual representation of the aircraft and the environment. Another advantage of the FSX was that it had a vast user community where they built and shared sceneries and aircraft, which could be directly inputted to the simulator, increasing the reality in terms of visual effects. However, due to the high graphic rendering requirement, the actual frame rate of the flight was averaged to about 25~30 frames per second, where the choppiness of the video was detected. 3.3.2.2 Laminar Research's X-Plane 9 Laminar Research's X-Plane 9 was another popular aircraft simulator that was available to the public. It took a different approach from the FSX in terms of calculating the equation of motion

27

of the aircraft. Laminar Research recently released X-Plane 10, which enhanced the graphics capability of the simulator. Unlike the FSX, X-Plane used blade element theory to calculate the flight dynamic of the aircraft. X-Plane put the solid model of the aircraft under the environment flow. This flow incorporated both the atmosphere conditions and the aircraft's flying condition. Then the program calculated the aerodynamic effects of the flow on small elements of the aircraft mesh. Then the results were integrated across the entire aircraft to output total flight dynamics. The data extraction system in the X-Plane was quite useful. Users could freely choose required data and express it in different methods. Users could choose to show the data on the cockpit, on the graph, export the entire data into a hard drive as a text array file, or all of the above simultaneously. This freedom of data extraction was a unique feature of X-Plane, garnering much attention from other engineers who use the program for their research. Compared to the FSX, X-Plane did not provide fancy land geometry rendering. It focused on the basics: land, water, and the atmosphere. Nevertheless, due to the reduced number of the object, the rendering speed was quite fast, providing a high Frames Per Second (FPS).

3.3.3 Choosing the Flight Simulation Program
Overall, Microsoft's FSX provided stunning graphics but limited access to the flight data. Laminar Research's X-Plane provided less sophisticated graphics, but allowed full access to the flight data. Most importantly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified the simulation and vehicle models so this program could be used for pilot training [51]. In addition, X-Plane had a series of engineering tools and equations to simulate its aircraft models [52]. For these reasons, X-Plane had been chosen for this thesis as well as being utilized in numerous aircraft and UAV research as a visualization and validation tool [53-55].

Chapter 4 UAV Derivative MDO Methodology for Flight Simulation

4.1 Overall Procedure
The pre-MDO process started by defining the mission objective of a UAV. Then the design requirements were established, according to the mission of the UAV. During this phase, a base aircraft was chosen to be optimized into a derivative design. Selected aircraft must suit the design objective, to have least changes on the design. This was because cost and time saving was the purpose of the derivative design. The aircraft characteristics were carefully inspected to identify areas for improvement. Once points of improvement were settled, the disciplines and design variables were selected to prepare for aircraft optimization process. Common disciplines chosen 29

for conceptual design of an aircraft is aerodynamic, weight & balance and performance. However, this can vary depending on the nature of the optimization problem. Two sets of results (configuration and performance) were generated after the optimization. If there were any errors, changes must be made to the selected disciplines and variables. Usually, changes are made on the boundary of the design variables. Time to time, a change must be done on the constraint to have optimal solution. In extreme cases, a new design variables are selected. It is important for the designer to know the formulated problem thoroughly, to apply the correct fixes. The configuration set was the physical attributes of the optimized aircraft. This set includes any physical attributes that affect the performance of the aircraft. The performance set included the usual performance characteristics of the aircraft such as cruise range, but extending to the stability and control, or any non-physical attributes that are quantifiable. These sets take two different paths after optimization. The configuration set was sent to the flight simulation phase where the performance set was saved to be used for flight data evaluation phase. First task done in the flight simulation phase was to make a virtual aircraft using PlaneMaker. It used the configuration set from optimization phase to make the virtual aircraft. Once enough aircraft models were made, series of virtual flight tests were performed. Data generated by the flight tests were polished using the Flight Data Conversion Program, so the flightdata analysis program could use it. The data was reviewed once more where only the important data were saved. Flight data evaluation phase came after the flight simulation phase. In this phase, the performance set from optimization was used as the numerical result, then compared with the polished data from the flight simulation phase. If they did not coincide, the consistency of the flight simulation result must be checked. If the flight simulation result was inconsistent, a human pilot

30

error may have occurred during the virtual flight testing, and it must be re-tested. If the flight simulation result was consistent, then the error could have occurred during the formulation of the optimization problem. In this case, a through study of the formulated MDO problem is needed, to find out the cause of the error. If the numerical result and simulated result coincide, the design procedure ends with a final report, if necessary.

31

4.2 Data Import to Simulation
The PlaneMaker, a complimentary software specifically made for X-Plane was the tool to generate an aircraft model. Some of the mandatory data required for the model was engine specification, wing geometry, fuselage geometry, and weight & balance. Once the optimization was complete, data was saved in separate file. The data was converted in such format where the user can easily put it into the PlaneMaker; in the order of its input menu, left to right then top to bottom. Figure 4.2 showed the one of the input case in PlaneMaker with optimization result.

Figure 4.2 Example of input of optimization result to PlaneMaker

4.3 Data Exportation
Commercial flight-data analysis program required flight data to analyze and animate. The development of the methodology and the data converter allowed the flight data generated by XPlane to be import into the flight-data analysis software. The data converter was coded in MATLAB [56] and was developed into an executable program with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) with MATLAB GUIDE as seen on Figure 4.3.

32

Figure 4.3 Flight data-converter program

4.3.1 Data Importation to the Data Converter
The flight data generated by X-Plane used its own naming convention to fit the data within its fixed width variable format. As seen on Figure 4.4 each column was composed of 14 characters. A separate database that had both X-Plane naming convention and common names used in aviation industry was made. This database held the unit of the numerical parameters and the type of the parameter as well. Sample flight data could be seen on appendix B also.

Figure 4.4 Typical data output from X-Plane

33

The data loaded went through the import algorithm seen on Figure 4.5 to sort the data efficiently. Depending on the export setting on the X-Plane, the data could have couple of parameters to hundreds of parameters. To adapt to any number of parameters, the importation algorithm arranges the data in single column matrix. If the content of the matrix changed from characters to numbers, the Npar counter goes up by one. If the content did not change, the Nrow counter goes up by one. This repeats until the end of the file, sorting the imported data in a matrix size of Npar by Nrow.

Figure 4.5 Import algorithm

4.3.2 Data Conversion and Data Save
Load data was inspected carefully to check if there were any error or missing parameters. Data conversion process converts the imported data into a format that can be directly used in common flight analysis software as seen on Figure 4.6. During this process, all parameter names were switched to standard names accepted by the flight analysis software. Also, three new rows of

34

data were created below the parameter names with unit, format and type information of the corresponding parameter. Finally, conversion was made for the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time and local time. These parameters were represented in hours originally, however it was mandatory for these parameter to have standard time format: HH:MM:SS.

Figure 4.6 Flowchart of the conversion process

Finally, the program used cell to csv function to save the converted data into a csv format as a typical flight analysis software can import csv data file.

Chapter 5 Application of Methodology

5.1 Mission Definition and Aircraft Selection
The mission objective of the UAV derivative was payload delivery under crisis due to natural disaster. It is difficult to secure a long airstrip when a city has been hit by a tsunami or an earthquake. Thus, the aircraft should be able to lift off in a short distance. In addition, it should have a long range and endurance to deliver further, or stay in the air longer to wait for aftershocks to pass by. The aircraft should be able to perform other missions such as payload para-dropping or surveillance of the disaster zone. Both of these missions take advantage from having long endurance. Possible mission profiles of the aircraft is shown in Figure 5.1.

36

Figure 5.1 Possible mission profiles

Found Aircraft Canada was a Canadian aircraft company founded in 1996. It acquired the right to produce the FBA-2C, an aircraft manufactured by Found Brothers Aviation Ltd. in the 1960s. Although the manufacturing of FBA-2C ceased in 1967 due to business related reasons, its reputation remained high over the next forty years. FBA-2C was the successor of the FBA-1, which was a successful bush plane with versatile landing capabilities. It was rugged enough to land and takeoff on gravel, turf, snow and ice. These characteristics were included in the newly designed Expedition E350, seen on Figure 5.2. Table 5.1 lists some of the performance specification of Expedition E350.

This aircraft was chosen for the thesis because of its performance characteristics and the mission objective. Compared to other aircraft in similar category, it exceled in many performance criteria, as seen on Appendix C. Moreover, it was a bush plane with a rugged design, capable of takeoff and landing on rough airstrips in relatively short distances. In addition, this aircraft was FAA type certified. Finally, the availability of the aircraft data was a big factor. The necessary data was acquired from the Found Aircraft.

5.2 MDO Analysis Modules
5.2.1 Aerodynamics

Figure 5.3 Aerodynamics analysis module

The aerodynamic module governed the shape and aerodynamics of the wing and the horizontal stabilizer. Figure 5.3 showed how the module was handled. The original shape of the main wing of the Expedition E350 was complicated. The root section of the wing was uniform where the tip section was tapered; forward swept and had linear change in airfoil thickness as it reaches the tip. The wing tip itself was backward swept Hoerner wing tip.

39

Figure 5.4 Original wing shape

This wing shape however was too complex to be applied to the thesis because it had too many variables. Therefore, the shape of the wing was simplified to a single sectioned tapered wing, where the taper of the wing started from the root rather than from half section.

Figure 5.5 Modified wing shape

This allowed use of simpler aerodynamic calculations rather than resource-heavy options such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for the module. Variables were calculated using the basic aerodynamics equations from various textbooks [58-62]: These equations were used because the thesis is dealing with the conceptual design stage. = (6)

5.2.2 Weight and Balance

Figure 5.6 Weight and balance analysis module

Weight and Balance discipline calculated the empty weight of the aircraft along with the Centre of Gravity (CG) location in x and z axis. The CG in y direction was assumed to be zero. Figure 5.6 showed how the module was handled. This discipline also governed the longitudinal balance of the aircraft in cruising stage. The empty weight of the aircraft was calculated by adding the weight of each component [61]. = .

The performance discipline calculated total fuel weight, range, endurance, ground-roll and total takeoff distance. The total fuel weight was calculated in this discipline rather than the weight and balance discipline because it was a critical factor to the range and endurance. The UAV derivative of the Expedition E350 had an interior configuration slightly different from the passenger version. The interior was horizontally split where the upper section was used for fuselage fuel tank and the lower section was used for payload bay. The total fuel weight was calculated by adding fuel weight from the wing tank and the new fuselage tank. The range and endurance was calculated by using conventional Breguet range equation [58]:

5.3 MDO Formulation
The optimization code for this thesis was developed in MATLAB [56]. The optimization method used was MDF [53], as explained in chapter 2. Formulated problem had the architecture on Figure 5.8

Figure 5.8 MDO architecture

The disciplines chosen for this MDO problem were aerodynamic, weight and balance and performance. The objective of the optimization was to maximize the endurance of the aircraft while meeting the constraints shown below. Optimization code was written in a way that it finds a minimum of a function. Therefore the actual cost function was the negative value of the endurance.

Equation (33) constrained the maximum takeoff weight Wsum to be under the total lift generated by the aircraft Ltotal while cruising. Equation (34) constrained that the location of the centre of gravity xcg does not exceed 10ft from the nose of the aircraft along the x axis. Equation (35) constrained the aircraft from become too heavy, by limiting the maximum takeoff weight to 5000, a 32% increase from the original aircraft. Equation (36) constrained the takeoff ground-roll distance STOG to 1000ft to keep the short take-off distance attribute of the aircraft. Finally, equation (37) constrained the moment generated at the centre of gravity Mcg to be zero while cruising, to achieve longitudinal balance. c5 was the only nonlinear equality constraint, and all of the other constraints were nonlinear inequality constraint. Table 5.2 showed the design variables and its boundaries. These variables were chosen because they were the variables that affected the performance of the aircraft most, with least changes. Furthermore, if any dramatic changes were made to the aircraft such as changing the fuselage and empennage length or changing the airfoil of the wing, it would not be a derivative of the original aircraft, rather a new airplane.

5.4 Virtual Flight Test Setup
The test flights had been done on three aircraft models: `Original', `Initial' and `Optimized' models as seen on Figure 5.10. The first model or `Original' model represented with the exact size and shape of the Expedition E350. The second model or `Initial' model represented with the simplified wing and horizontal stabilizer with initial variables. The final model or `Optimized' model represented with the results from the optimization. Each aircraft model went through different series of virtual flight tests.

Figure 5.10 'Original', `Initial' and `Optimized' aircraft models from left to right

5.4.1 Test 1
The main objective of the first test was verifying the cruise performance of the `Original' model by comparing its result with the reference from the Pilot's Operating H andbook (POH) [64]. Moreover, the cruise performance of each models were compared side by side. Each aircraft was flown at the pressure altitude of 2,000 to 12,000 ft, with 2,000 ft increments. Once the aircraft reached the designated altitude, its power was adjusted to 2,600 RPM then the aircraft was stabilized until it was in steady cruise state. From this test, the cruise speed and the fuel consumption of each aircraft was found.

5.4.2 Test 2
The second test checked the yaw stability of the aircraft by plotting the sideslip angle after small disturbance. The test was performed at 8,000 ft pressure altitude with 2,600 engine RPM. After the aircraft was stabilized, a small disturbance was applied by a step input for rudder. To reduce human interface error, autopilot was engaged. When the autopilot was engaged, rudder was the only control activated. Hence only the yawing stability was checked.

The final test was a scenario test where two airports were selected and a full flight was commenced. Table 5.3 showed the two selected airports with their attributes. From takeoff to landing, the aircraft configuration was set to the setting from the POH as seen on Table 5.4. The detailed mission profile could be seen on Figure 5.12.

This test focused on gathering general performance data; takeoff performance and cruise performance. Landing performance was disregarded because landing was done manually by less experienced operator whrereas the climb and cruise was done with autopilot engaged. The data 51

collected was used differently for each model. The virtual flight test result of the `Original' model was compared with the result calculated from the POH to find the accuracy of the simulation in terms of performance. Sample calculations from the POH was shown on Appendix F. The virtual flight test result of the `Initial' model was compared with the test result of the `Original; model to check how well the simplified model represented the original aircraft. Finally, the virtual flight test result of the `Optimized' model was compared with the numerical result optained from the MDO.

Chapter 6 Results and Discussion

6.1 Optimization Results
The convergence history of the optimization was shown in Figure 6.1. It represented the negative values of the cost function history. As seen on Table 6.1, the solution was converged without any constraint violation. Figure 6.2 demonstrated the physical shape of the optimized UAV. Compared to the original aircraft or initial aircraft, the wing and horizontal stabilizer's size increased. This was to ensure the wing generated enough lift for increased weight. A careful study of Table 6.1 and Table 6.2 indicated that the optimizer found the perfect balance between the weight (increased by fuel quantity) and lift. Analyzing the Breguet equation showed there were several ways to increase the cruise range. The propeller with higher efficiency or more efficient engine could not be used because it was not considered as a design variable. Another way to increase the cruise range was to increase the CL/CD ratio. This was also not a valid option because the airfoil was not considered as a design variable. The change of engine, propeller and airfoil was 53

not considered because this was a derivative design. The last option left to increase the cruise range was to increase the Wini/Wfin ratio. Assuming there were no changes in the payload weight, the only way to increase the Wini/Wfin ratio was increasing the fuel weight. The horizontal stabilizer's size increased to counter the extra moment generated by the main wing. The endurance of the aircraft increase to 21.715 hours, from 10 hours.

6.2 Flight Simulation Results
6.2.1 Test 1 Result
The results from the first test was divided into each section with corresponding altitude. The fuel consumption was computed by subtracting the final fuel weight from the starting fuel weight, divided by the time segment. The airspeed average was calculated within the same range of data. These data were presented on Appendix D. Figure 6.3 showed the performance error between the `Original' model and the actual flight data. The maximum error was at 6,000 ft pressure altitude with 9.75% error for the fuel consumption. The minimum error was at 10,000 ft pressure altitude with 0.23% error for the speed. Generally, the error was below 10%. Considering the actual flight data was taken from virtual flight tests which were performed in uncontrolled environment, this value was acceptable.

55

Figure 6.3 Fuel consumption and speed error - 'Original' vs POH

Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5 showed the fuel consumption and cruise speed comparison respectively. The fuel consumption of the `Optimized' model was slightly higher than that of the `Initial' model. However, since the `Optimized' model carries more fuel, it had extended range and endurance. This also affected the cruise speed of the `Optimized' model. It had the slowest cruise speed until 10000ft because it was the heaviest of the three models. Both fuel consumption and cruise speed show similarity in trends.

Each aircraft went through the scenario flight for four times. The averaged result were used for comparison. The purpose of this test was to show the virtual flight test capability using the methodology introduced in this thesis. The comparison between the simulated result of the `Original' aircraft was displayed with the POH result as seen on Table 6.4 and Figure 6.7. Every criteria except climb distance had error less than 10%. The error spike for climb distance could be from human error in either flight phase or data analysis phase.

The final comparison was between the simulated results and numerical results of the `Optimized' model. As seen on Table 6.6 some of the criteria were not calculated numerically and were replaced with maximum endurance and maximum range. Figure 6.9 showed the error between the two results. The error of liftoff speed was highest. The liftoff speed was measured at the point where there was noticeable increase on the vertical speed. The actual liftoff could have happened after that point. Other errors were less than 10%, which was fairly good.

Chapter 7 Conclusion and Future Work

7.1 Conclusion
This thesis introduced an integrated design method for UAV derivatives of a general aviation aircraft. The methodology included the optimization of UAV derivative utilizing MDO and virtual flight testing of the optimized result with a flight simulator. Found Aircraft Expedition E350 aircraft was selected as the baseline for the UAV derivative as it had advantages over other aircraft in the category including the maximum takeoff weight and takeoff distance. The MDF method with SQP algorithm was applied for the MDO formulation and endurance maximization was defined as the objective function. Aerodynamic, weight & balance and performance were chosen disciplines. The optimization process delivered the UAV derivative of the Expedition E350. It met its goal with increased endurance up to 21.7 hours, while satisfying all of the constraints. The optimization result and additional parameters for the X-Plane implementation were shown as the final result of the optimization phase. In-house code was developed for optimization and data 62

transition to and from the X-Plane. Configuration results from the optimization phase was transferred into X-Plane using PlaneMaker. Three aircraft models were created: `Original', `Initial' and `Optimized'. The `Original' model was created using the data provided by the POH and exhibited physical characteristic as similar as possible with the real aircraft. The `Initial' model was created using the simplified data where wing and HS' physical characteristics were simplified to run MDO more efficiently. Finally, the `Optimized' model was created with the results from the MDO. These aircraft conducted numerous virtual flight tests. The first test compared the simulated performance result of the `Original' aircraft with the POH's reference values. The second test checked each model's yawing stability. The final test checked the takeoff and cruising performance of each aircraft. Landing performance was disregarded because it was done manually and showed discrepancy between the flights. Results from the virtual flight tests were converted and transferred to a flight-data analysis program. The flight-data analysis program was used to locate specific data from specific timeframe. The first test exhibited less than 10% error on cruise performance between the `Original' and POH. From the second test, the `Original' and `Initial' behaved similarly while `Optimized' model had lower natural frequency and time to half amplitude but higher damping ratio. This was due to considerable changes made to the aerodynamic surfaces. The final test showed less discrepancy between the POH and `Original' results and between the `Optimized' and numerical results, with most criteria's error under 10%. Throughout the above process, the use of MDO and flight simulation to create a UAV was demonstrated to be a viable method.

7.2 Contributions
The following contributions were made in this thesis: 63

1. MDO method of UAV derivative had been developed. This method included four major phases: pre-MDO phase, MDO phase, flight simulation phase and flight data evaluation phase. This method was capable of optimizing an aircraft into a UAV then verify its performance by virtual flight tests. 2. Built the RFBS. This reconfigurable flight simulator was capable of generating valuable flight data effortlessly. It was also a great training tool for students to learn the basics of flight simulation, virtual flight testing, flight data generation and flight data analysis. Finally, it served as a platform for flight simulation phase and flight data evaluation phase of the optimization procedure. 3. Developed a flight data converter program that converts raw flight data to be used for a commercial flight-data analysis software. This enhanced the capabilities of the RFBS by connecting the off-the-shelf flight simulation software seamlessly with commercial flight-data analysis software. This was an important feature because it made flight-data generation relatively easy and cheap for academic purposes. 4. The X-plane was verified as a viable tool for flight data generation.

7.3 Future Work
Although the methodology of using MDO and flight simulation to design a UAV was validated, improvements were still necessary. First of all, the MDO process demonstrated in this thesis was low fidelity optimization relying only on empirical equations. Adapting high fidelity analysis software may improve the optimization results and provide values that are more realistic. Moreover, the aircraft design generally required more than three disciplines; however, the stability and control discipline was missing in this thesis. Hence, the addition of stability and control could 64

improve the result of the MDO. Furthermore, the optimization only considered single object limiting the capability of the UAV as it compensated some of its performance characteristics. Multi-objective MDO process could improve the result without compromising on some performance characteristic. Moreover, the data transfer to the X-Plane was done manually and it could be improved by writing a separate code to reduce human effort leading to the reduction of human error. Finally, although X-Plane utilized unique methods to solve equations of motion, it had its limitations, as it was a simulation software developed for entertainment purposes. The MIMS facility acquired Flightgear [66] and a licensed version of PRESAGIS FlightSIM [67]. Flightgear is popular amongst researcher because of its connectivity with MATLAB. FlightSIM is a high fidelity flight simulator used by aircraft manufacturers and militaries around the world. Provided with adequate information, it will generate excellent virtual flight test results. Integration of these simulation software will improve the capability of the design methodology much further.
