Development of electrostatic actuators with large out-of-plane deflection and its  application in scanning display  Chao Fan  Doctor of Philosophy  Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Ryerson University, 2016 

Abstract
  Electrostatic  out-of-plane  microactuators  have  been  widely  used  in  applications  of  variable  capacitors, optical attenuators, optical switches and scanning displays due to their small size, low  cost,  simple  and  diverse  structure,  low  power  consumption  and  high  compatibility  with  semiconductor  process.  The  large  out-of-plane  displacement  of  the  microactuator  with  high  reliability  is  preferred  in  order  to  increase  the  tuning  range,  tunability  and  the  display  size.  However,  the  "pull-in"  instability  associated  with  conventional  attractive-force  electrostatic  microactuators significantly limits the out-of-plane displacement and lowers the operation stability.  A repulsive-force microactuator has been previously developed which can achieve large out-ofplane rotation and does not suffer from the "pull-in" instability. However, a larger rotation angle  of  the  repulsive-force  actuator  is  highly  desired  in  order  to  improve  its  performance  in  the  applications  such  as  increasing  the  tunability  and  the  scanning  angle.  In  this  thesis  two  novel  repulsive-force  actuators,  i.e.,  two-row  interdigitating-finger  and  two-width-finger  (TWF)  actuators  are  developed  which  output  much  larger  out-of-plane  rotation  than  the  previous  repulsive-force actuator without suffering from the "pull-in" instability.  The mathematical models  are established for both actuators using a hybrid approach. The actuators require only two thin  layers and are suitable for surface micromachining process. The measured results show that the 

iii   

    two  microactuators  can  achieve  rotation  angles  of  11.5°  and  7.5°  at  150  V  respectively.  The  improvements are 100% and 35% in comparison to the previous repulsive-force actuator with the  same  size,  stiffness  and  driving  voltage.  A  2D  scanning  micromirror  has  been  developed  and  fabricated based on the two-row-finger (TRF) actuator. Experimental results show the micromirror  has larger rotation angle and faster response speed than those of the micromirror driven by the  previous repulsive-force microactuator. The vector scanning display based on the micromirror is  demonstrated. An advanced display approach is developed to generate displays with less distortion  and  higher  refreshing  rate  compared  to  the  previous  generic  display  approach.  The  automotive  Head-up  Display  (HUD)  based  on  the  micromirror  and  advanced  display  approach  has  been  constructed for both real and virtual image configurations, which has advantages of small size, low  cost, large viewing angle and good visibility over those HUDs in the market.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Out-of-plane microactuator review 1.1.1 Microactuator Microactuator  is  a  microscopic  mechanism  that  provides  actuation  motion  to  other  micro  structures. It is a constitutional device of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). If classified  by the moving direction, there exists in-plane and out-of-plane motion microactuators. The plane  refers to the fixed layer of the microactuator. The in-plane motion indicates that the movement is  in a plane parallel to the substrate and the out-of-plane motion means the movement has an angle  with the substrate.   If  classified  by  driving  principle,  microactuators  can  be  categorized  into  4  types,  i.e.,  electrostatic,  electrothermal,  electromagnetic  and  piezoelectric  actuations  [1],  [2].  The  electrostatic actuation utilizes the electrostatic force between the opposite charges on the surfaces  of different electrodes. Electrostatic force is not used in driving macroscopic machinery due to the  small force (in the magnitude of µN). Instead, it is widely used to drive micro devices due to the  large surface-area-to-volume ratio, the small mass and short distance between electrodes in the  micro  electrostatic  actuator,  which  provides  enough  force  to  drive  the  micro  structure.  The  electrothermal microactuator [3]­[7] utilizes thermal expansion and contraction of the structures.  The  heat  source  is  from  the  resistive  heating  generated  by  the  electric  current.  Cooling  can  be  achieved by conduction, convection and radiation dissipations. Usually electrothermal actuation  can  generate  larger  forces  and  displacement  than  electrostatic  actuators,  but  the  power  consumption  is  much  higher.  Electromagnetic  microactuator  [8]­[12]  uses  the  magnetic  force  exerted on the magnetic material or the Lorentz force exerted on the conductors. It consumes high  power  and  requires  external  magnetic  field.    Piezoelectric  microactuators  [13]­[17]  uses  the  inverse  piezoelectric  effect,  i.e.,  piezoelectric    materials  generate  deformation  when  subject  to  electric  field.  Thus  far  the  fabrication  of  piezoelectric  materials  is  not  highly  compatible  with  semiconductor process. All of the four conventional driving principles have been used to make  microactuators to generate out-of-plane motion.   Among the  four driving  principles, the electrostatic actuation has  advantages of low power  consumption, high efficiency, high compatibility with semiconductor process, simple and diverse  1   

    structures.  As  a  result,  a  lot  of  electrostatic  microactuators  have  been  developed  for  optical  switches [18]­[20], optical attenuators [21], [22], tunable optical filter [23] and scanning displays  [24]­[27].  All  of  those  applications  require  out-of-plane  motions,  which  highly  desire  large  rotation  angles  in  order  to  increase  the  switching  number  of  ports,  the  attenuating  range  and  tunability as well as enlarge the display area for scanning display application. There are two types  of conventional out-of-plane electrostatic actuators, i.e., parallel-plate (or gap-closing) and vertical  comb-drive actuators, both of which utilize the attractive force to pull the moving electrode toward  the fixed electrode.   1.1.2 Electrostatic attractive-force out-of-plane rotation actuators A parallel-plate actuator can be considered as a capacitor with one plate fixed and the other  movable. Its schematic is shown in Fig. 1.1. By applying electric potentials between the two plates,  the movable plate subject to the electrostatic attractive force moves towards the fixed plate. With  the movement of the movable plate, the gap between the plates, i.e., g, is closed. In this case, it is  also called gap-closing actuator. The movable plate becomes stabilized when the attractive force  is balanced by the mechanical restoring force of the spring.

  Fig. 1.1 Schematic of parallel capacitor.   Although the parallel-plate actuator is easy to be implemented due to its simple structure, the  displacement is limited by the initial gap between fixed and movable electrodes. Furthermore, the  parallel-plate actuator suffers from the "pull-in" instability which limits its displacement to less  than 1/3 of the initial gap [13]­[15] and causes low operational stability. The "pull-in" is caused  due to the fact that electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the square of the gap. As the gap  reduces, there is a point beyond which the upward mechanical restoring force cannot balance the  downward electrostatic force anymore and consequently the movable plate is pulled towards the  fixed plate until they contact. 

2   

    Much  work  has  been  done  to  increase  the  travel  range  of  the  parallel-plate  actuator.  One  method is to enlarge the initial gap. Self-assembly is used for surface micromachined parallel-plate  actuator to achieve this [19]. The micromirror in [19] was actuated by the electrode plate under it.  The micromirror together with its supporting frame is lifted by serval self-lifting assembly arms  to increase the gap between the micromirror plate and its underneath electrodes. The micromirror  is able to achieve 6.6° rotation angle under 180 V DC. However, the increase of the initial gap will  lead to large driving voltage, and the self-assembly structures require large area. Another method  to improve the displacement of the parallel-plate actuator is to use leverage structure to amplify  the displacement [31]­[34]. The parallel-plate actuator and the actuation beam are located at two  sides of the levering beam as shown in Fig. 1.2 and Fig. 1.3. However, a long leverage beam is  needed if a large displacement is to be achieved, which requires a lot of space. In addition, the  actuator still suffers from the "pull-in" instability, which lowers the operational stability.

Fig. 1.3 A voltage controlled C-V response tuning and SEM image of the fabricated device [34].  One method to avoid the "pull-in" effect existed in a parallel plate electrostatic microactuator  is to design the electrodes in an offset-drive configuration. Instead of putting an electrode right  beneath the movable plate, two electrodes are located on both sides of the movable plate [35]­[38].  3   

    Consequently, the "pull-in" effect is avoided and the movable plate is mainly driven by the electric  fields between it and the side electrodes. The offset-drive configuration has similar structure to  vertical  comb-drive  which  is  usually  fabricated  using  bulk  micromachining  process  [36],  [39].  However  the  offset-drive  method  is  suitable  for  surface  micromachining  process  which  can  significantly extend the travel range of out-of-plane actuators. Rosa et al. [35] presented an offsetdrive  structure  with  two  tapered  shaped  external  electrodes  located  on  each  side  of  a  buckled  cantilever beam as shown in Fig. 1.4. Prototypes were fabricated and it was proved experimentally  that  the  cantilever  beam  was  able  to  travel  almost  the  entire  movement  range.  Large  actuation  voltage is required (more than 160 V) to achieve the full range travel and the actuator requires a  pre-lifting movable plate using the residual stress gradient which is hard to be controlled. A similar  structure  was  presented  in  [36].  The  substrate  effect  was  analyzed  and  it  was  proved  that  the  driving voltage could be lowered by removing the substrate under the moving plate. According to  the  analysis,  the  tapered  side  electrode  design  in  [35]  is  a  variation  of  the  series  capacitor  mechanism [40]. However, the presented actuator in [36] is a fixed-fixed beam which is difficult  to be utilized to drive some other relative large microstructures. 

  Fig. 1.4 Basic structures of offset-drive, parallel plates and comb-drive [35].  Nonlinear  springs  are  also  developed  to  cancel  the  nonlinearity  relationship  between  the  electrostatic attractive force and the gap between electrodes in a parallel-plate microactuator [41]­ [43]. A method of designing the nonlinear spring was presented in [42] and a macro-scale test was  performed to verify the design model. The proposed design methodology can be potentially used  in micro-scale for microactuators. However, due to the limitation of the fabrication process, the 

4   

    nonlinear spring is difficult to be fabricated in a micromachined out-of-plane actuators. As a result,  the proposed methodology was only verified using an in-plane motion microactuator [43].    In  addition,  control  methods  are  also  used  to  extend  the  travel  range  of  the  parallel-plate  actuator such as charge control [40], [44]­[47] and voltage control [48], [49]. However, the control  methods either increase the driving voltage or require a sensing mechanism which adds complexity  to the design. Moreover, even though the parallel-plate actuator can be controlled to travel  the  entire range of the initial gap, the displacement is still limited by the initial gap between the plates.  The above limitations determine that the parallel-plate actuator is not suitable for outputting a large  out-of-plane displacement.   The other type of electrostatic attractive-force actuator, i.e., vertical comb-drive actuator, is  more  suitable  for  applications  which  require  large  out-of-plane  displacements,  especially  in  driving scanning micromirrors [50]­[61]. The vertical comb-drive consists of an array of stationary  fingers interdigitated with another array of movable fingers with vertical offset. When a voltage is  applied between them, the movable comb will move towards the fixed comb. The electrostatic  attractive force  generated  between the two arrays of combs is  independent of the displacement  [62]. However vertical comb-drive actuators suffer from the side "pull-in" instability if the fingers  are not properly aligned in the transverse direction due to the imperfection in fabrication or external  vibration [39].   In order to avoid the side "pull-in" instability and make an initial vertical offset between the  fixed  and  movable  combs,  many  fabrication  processes  have  been  developed.  The  surface  micromachining is used to fabricate a staggered vertical comb-drive based on (SUMMiT-V) [50]  as shown in Fig. 1.5. The actuator was used to drive a mirror plate (137 µm × 120 µm). The static  mechanical  rotation  angle  was  measured  to  be  ±  5.9°  under  a  6  V  DC  driving  voltage.  One  drawback is that the travel range of the mirror plate is limited by its size and consequently this  design is suitable for small mirrors.   Another  comb-drive  actuator  which  requires  only  one  structure  layer  has  been  recently  presented in [63], [64]. The vertical offset between the movable comb and fixed comb is obtained  by  the  residual  stress  along  the  bending  beam.  Experimental  results  showed  that  a  vertical  displacement of 4.81 µm can be reached at 150 V. Side "pull-in" instability happens when the  applied voltage is above 160 V. The achieved travel range is relatively small, which is only about  5   

    22%  of  the  entire  travel  range.  The  residual  stress  gradient,  which  is  difficult  to  be  accurately  controlled, leads to the small initial vertical offset between fixed and movable combs and then a  small displacement  

   

 

Fig. 1.5 Left: The schematic structure of the proposed micromirror. Right: The SEM micrograph  of the fabricated micromirror with the other half of the micromirror removed [50].    Bulk micromachining is more popular in fabricating the vertical comb-drives which is able to 

provide large travel range to the actuator and the driven microstructures [39]. One challenge of the  bulk micromachining is the alignment of the fingers. Many processes have been developed with  different methods to help solve this issue. For example, a fabrication process based on SOI wafer  bonding was developed to avoid the misalignment of the combs in [52]. Measurements show that  less  than  0.1%  misalignment  can  be  obtained  using  the  presented  fabrication  process,  which  enables the perfectly aligned device to travel 98% of the full range. Other fabrication processes  with their own alignment mechanisms are also presented, such as displaced anchor process [65]­ [67], single wafer process [68]­[70], polysilicon trench re-fill process [71]­[73], custom SOI wafer  process [52], [74]­[77], SOI wafer process [53], [78]­[85], single device layer process [86]­[91]  and multiple wafer process[92]­[94].   The displacement of the vertical comb-drive is limited by the smaller thickness between the  movable  comb  and  fixed  comb  [39],  [95].  The  comb  thickness  of  the  bulk  micromachined  actuators is usually in tens of microns which limits their DC travel range. As a result, many vertical  comb-drives  need  to  operate  under  resonant  frequency  to  obtain  large  deflections  [52].  For  example the comb-drive actuated micromirror presented in [52] is able to achieve only 4° optical  DC  scanning  angle.  However,  under  the  resonant  driving  mode,  the  optical  scanning  angle  increases to about 40°.  

6   

    Besides  driving  the  actuator  in  resonant  mode,  many  other  studies  have  been  conducted  to  extend the travel range of vertical comb-drive actuators. For example, a dual mode comb-drive  [93], [96] is able to enlarge the actuation force and the travel range. Different from the conventional  comb-drive which has one row of fixed comb, the dual comb has two rows of fixed combs located  below and above the movable comb as shown in Fig. 1.6 (b). A large DC optical scanning angle,  i.e., 32° was measured for the 1D scanning micromirror driven by the dual mode comb-drives at  100 V DC [93]. However, the dual mode configuration requires 3 structure layers with relative  large gap between each other, which leads to complicated fabrication process. Furthermore, due  to the process limitation, the lower fixed comb and the upper fixed comb are usually asymmetrical  with respect to the movable comb in the middle, which result in complicated driving approach.    

 

     (a)                                                                  (b) 

 

Fig. 1.6 (a) Comb-drive with fixed combs in one side of the movable comb (b) Dual mode combdrive [93].  Another way to improve the deflection of vertical comb-drive is to use angular vertical combdrive (AVC). According to the types of the offset the vertical comb-drives can be categorized into  staggered vertical comb-drive (SVC) and angular vertical comb-drive (AVC). The movable combs  of SVC have a vertical translational initial offset with the fixed comb, and the movable combs of  AVC  have  an  angular  initial  offset  with  the  fixed  comb.  It  has  been  proved  that  AVC  with  relatively thin fingers has a 60% larger deflection than that of the SVC of the same dimension [57].   From the literature review in this section, it can be concluded that the parallel-plate actuator  has the advantage of simple structure. However, the "pull-in" effect and the small gap between the  two electrodes limit the out-of-plane deflection. In contrast, the vertical comb-drive can generate  larger  displacement  due  to  large  vertical  dimensions  and  has  no  direct  "pull-in"  effect.  Nevertheless, more complicated fabrication processes are required to generate the initial vertical  7   

    offset between the fixed and movable combs and to avoid the finger misalignment. Furthermore,  it  suffers  from  the  side  "pull-in"  instability  which  even  though  can  be  avoided  by  introducing  proper  alignment  mechanism  in  the  fabrication  process,  will  still  be  a  potential  unstable  factor  when exposed to relative large external vibrations. A novel type of electrostatic repulsive-force  actuators has been previously developed which can generate repulsive electrostatic force to push  the movable structures out-of-plane. It can overcome some of the disadvantages of parallel-plate  and vertical comb-drive.   1.1.3 Electrostatic repulsive-force out-of-plane actuators Different from the attractive-force electrostatic actuators which utilize the attraction force to  bring two electrodes together, repulsive-force (or repulsive-torque) actuators use the electrostatic  net  force  to  push  the  movable  electrodes  away  from  the  underlying  electrodes  whose  effect  is  repulsive  [97].  It  is  noted  that  the  "repulsive-force"  or  "repulsive-torque"  here  is  not  simply  generated from repelling force between charges of the same polarity. They are the net force of a  number of electrostatic forces which are exerted on the top and bottom surfaces of the movable  electrode. The total force exerted on the top surface is upward, and the total force exerted on the  bottom surface is downward. Due to the asymmetrical electric filed around the movable plate, the  force  on  the  top  surface  is  larger  than  that  on  the  bottom  surface.  As  a  result,  the  resultant  electrostatic  force  pushes  the  movable  structure  away  from  its  counterpart.  The  asymmetrical  electric filed is generated by a series of properly configured electrodes. It has the advantage over  the attractive-force actuators of larger out-of-plane displacement and higher reliability since 1) Its  displacement is not limited by the space between the movable and fixed electrodes 2) It does not  suffer from the "pull-in" instability that encountered by parallel-plates and comb-drives  [1], [2],  [28], [29], [98].  Different  structures  of  repulsive-force  actuator  have  been  presented.  A  3-layer  electrostatic  actuator, which can generate repulsive force, is reported in [99], [100] as shown in Fig. 1.7. The 3  electrodes constructed by 3 different layers are all vertical aligned with an isolation layer (oxide)  sandwiched between each two layers. The top electrode is the movable structure while the bottom  2 electrodes are fixed. By  applying the same electric potential to the top two electrodes, and a  different potential to the most bottom electrode, an out-of-plane electrostatic force is generated on  the movable electrode and pushes it to move upward. The advantage of the design is that it has a  8   

    large fill-factor similar to that of the parallel-plate actuators. However, due to the fabrication limit,  the tip of the movable structure suffers from a stiction force (Fc in Fig. 1.7) which prevents the tip  from  separating  with  the  underlying  fixed  metal  layer.  This  significantly  limits  the  actuator's  displacement. It is reported that the driving voltage is limited to a low value, i.e., 40 V, beyond  which it will cause severe current leakage of the sandwiched isolation layer. A small out-of-plane  displacement is obtained which is less than 0.8 µm.  

  Fig. 1.7 Left: Schematic of 3-layer repulsive-force actuator. Right: Scanning electron microscope  image (SEM) of a fabricated device with 100 × 100 m paddle [99].  Another 2-layer repulsive-force out-of-plane actuator has been presented in [1], [2], [28], [29],  [98] which requires only two thin layers. The first design of this type of actuator was presented in  [101]  which  was  used  to  drive  a  micromirror  plate  to  realize  the  out-of-plane  translation.  The  configuration of the electrodes is shown in Fig. 1.8. The top layer is the movable structure, and the  bottom  layer  is  the  fixed  electrodes.  The  electrodes  are  finger  shaped  and  are  called  fingers  hereafter. There is a corresponding fixed finger under each moving finger, which are both subject  to the same electric potential. There are unaligned fixed fingers located on the sides of each pair  of  movable  fingers  and  its  underling  fixed  fingers.  The  unaligned  fingers  are  applied  different  electric potentials. There are two fixed electrodes between the two neighboring moving electrodes  as shown in Fig. 1.8 (b). The electrostatic force is exerted on both the top and bottom surfaces of  the movable fingers with the net force upward due to the electrode configuration. As a result, the  moving fingers are driven to move away from their underlying electrodes, and the effect of the  force is repulsive. The actuator was fabricated using a 2-layer PolyMUMPs process and is able to  achieve a vertical stroke of 1.75 um at 50 V DC. The displacement is more than 3 times of that of  the  conventional  MUMPs  translational  micromirrors.  A  similar  actuator  was  also  presented  as  Actuator B  in  [102]  and  a  repulsive-force  actuator  with  different  electrode  configuration  was  presented  as  Actuator A.  However,  Actuator A  is  difficult  to  be  fabricated  since  it  requires  an 

9   

    insolation  layer  to  be  placed  between  the  driven  microstructure  and  the  movable  fingers.  The  applications of using the actuators in adaptive optics were presented in [102], [103]. 

  Fig. 1.8 The novel translation micromirror for adaptive optics [101].  In addition to the translation actuator, the repulsive force driving mechanism was also used to  construct out-of-plane rotation actuators [97], [104], [105]. The vertical translation is converted to  out-of-plane  rotation  by  anchoring  one  side  of  the  movable  fingers.  A  rotation  actuator  was  presented in [97] and was used to form a 1D scanner. A detailed electric filed analysis has been  given  and  an  analytical  model  has  been  built  which  matches  well  with  the  simulation  and  experimental results. The proposed actuator was fabricated using a 2-layer MUMPs process. The  testing results showed that the micromirror has a rotation angle of 0° ~ 2.1° with 0 ~ 200 V DC  driving voltages. The frequency response of the micromirror was tested to be 150 Hz. A design  optimization  model  for  the  actuator  was  built  in  [105]  using  a  hybrid  approach  by  combining  numerical 2D electric field simulation and analytical derivations. The hybrid approach provides a  good guidance to create the math model for other electrostatic actuators. By using the optimization  model, the finger width can be optimized by knowing some basic parameters of the actuator such  as the actuator's width and length, the spring stiffness and the desired maximum driving voltage.  The actuator having the same size and spring stiffness as the one presented in [97] was optimized  using the proposed optimization model and fabricated (SEM image shown in Fig. 1.9). The test  result shows that a rotation angle of 4.4° can be achieved at 200 V DC and there is more than 100% 

10   

    improvement compared to the non-optimized actuator presented in [97]. The application of using  the rotary actuator in automated microassembly was presented in [106].  

  Fig. 1.9 SEM image of the optimized actuator fabricated using the PolyMUMPs process [105]. 

  Fig. 1.10 SEM images of the actuator subject to different voltages [107].  One important application of the repulsive-force actuators presented in [97], [105] is to drive  a 2D scanning micromirror [107] which is shown in Fig. 1.10. Four identical actuators are used to  drive a center micromirror plate. The measured results show that the micromirror has a static outof-plane translation of 86 µm at 200 V DC. The micromirror can also operate in rotation mode  which  can  achieve  ±  1.5°  rotation  angles  under  200  V  maximum  driving  voltage.  Some  applications  of  the  micromirror  are  developed  such  as  laser  scanning  vector  display  [108]  and  automotive head-up display [109].  

11   

      Compared to the attractive-force actuators the presented repulsive-force actuators [97], [105], 

[107]  is  superior  since  it  suffers  from  neither  the  direct  "pull-in"  effect  nor  the  side  "pull-in"  instability. Furthermore, the travel range is not limited by the initial gap between the two opposite  electrodes. They can be used for both translation [102] and rotation [97], [105], [107] driving. It  also has a simple structure which requires two thin layers and can be fabricated using low cost  commercialized surface micromachining process instead of some customized processes which are  high  cost.  However,  the  currently  developed  repulsive-force  actuators  have  three  major  disadvantages. The first is the rough surface quality due to releasing holes and dimples that are  introduced in the surface micromachining process [110]. It limits the micromirror to be used in  some optical applications which have high requirement on the micromirrors' surface quality. One  potential approach to solve this is to develop a bonding technique to bond a high surface quality  silicon mirror plate on top of the surface micromachined mirror plate. One promising methodology  has been presented in [111]. The second issue is the relative low fill-factor of the device, which is  similar  to  the  vertical  comb-drive  actuators.  This  issue  is  attributed  to  the  configuration  of  the  electrodes that requires unaligned fixed fingers on both sides of the movable finger. One possible  solution to this issue has been presented in [102] as  Actuator A which introduced an insolation  layer between the movable fingers and the driven microstructure. The mechanism is difficult to be  implemented due to the limitation of the fabrication process. Another solution has been reported  in [103], which utilizes the movable finger as both the actuation beam and the spring. However,  the presented solution is only limited to the actuators with small out-of-plane deflection. A feasible  solution to improve the fill-factor of repulsive-force actuators with large vertical deflections has  not  been  proposed  yet.  The  third  issue  is  the  relative  small  force  and  then  small  out-of-plane  deflection generated by the actuator. This limitation is critical and needs to be addressed in order  to use the repulsive-force actuator in practical applications because: 1) A voltage as high as about  200 V [107] has to be applied to the existing repulsive-force actuators in order to generate enough  force/torque, which is close to the breakdown voltage of the substrate insulation layer. For example  silicon nitride (0.6 µm) layer on the substrate acts as the insulation layer in PolyMUMPs [112];  and 2) If voltage lower than 150 V is to be used, the size of the actuator needs to be significantly  increased  in  order  to  provide  enough  force/torque.  For  example,  the  size  of  the  micromirror  developed in [107]  has a size of 3.3 × 3.3 mm. Further increase the size of the micromirror may  lead  to  a  bulky  device  and  deteriorate  the  dynamic  performance  of  the  micromirror  due  to  the  12   

    increased damping. Thus, the development of a repulsive-force rotation actuator with output torque  (and then rotation angle) much larger than that of the existing ones is the first objective of this  thesis.  In  addition,  the  microactuator  that  is  to  be  developed  should  have  low  cost  and  high  fabrication yield, which is suitable for mass production and various applications.   1.2 Micromirror based laser scanning display review

Fig. 1.12 (a) Laser projection based assembly and tooling guidance [115] (b) Laser show [116].  The laser scanning display (LSD) is widely used in manufacturing such as assembly guidance  [115] and laser shows [116]. Conventionally, the galvanometer scanner shown in Fig. 1.11 is used  to steer the laser beam to scan through desired trajectories. It has large mechanical rotation angles  (> ±10°) with frequency bandwidth higher than 1KHz [115]. However, such scanning system is  composed of two large scanners and some bulky peripherals such as servo circuits, driving module  and  heat  sinks.  The  scanning  micromirrors  based  on  out-of-plane  electrostatic  actuators  have  advantages of small volume, low power consumption and simple optical setup [27], [93] and hence  are getting more attentions.   13   

    There  are  two  schemes  of  micromirror  based  laser  scanning  display,  i.e.,  raster  and  vector  scanning display.  In the raster scanning display,  the laser beam is  controlled to scan through  a  display  area  line  by  line.  As  a  result,  one  scanning  axis  is  required  to  have  a  faster  scanning  frequency than the other to perform raster scanning.  In the vector display, the laser beam only  scans  through  lines  and  curves  of  the  desired  vector  patterns.  According  to  different  scanning  schemes, the micromirror types are also different. The raster scanning display requires resonant  scanning  micromirror  with  one  or  both  axes  working  under  their  resonant  frequency  so  that  a  relative high scanning frequency and large scanning angle can be achieved. The two axes of this  type of micromirror is divided into slow axis and fast axis. The fast axis works under its resonant  frequency so that the excited resonant vibration of the actuator is able to steer the micromirror to  scan through a large area rapidly. The slow axis has relaxed restriction and may work at resonant  or non-resonant mode. The vector scanning display requires quasistatic micromirror which can be  stabilized at any rotation angle in the operation range and is able to steer the laser beam to track a  desired  trajectory  point  by  point  to  generate  a  vector  graphic.  It  is  noted  here  that  some  micromirrors are able to be used for both raster scanning and vector scanning. However, they are  always more suitable for one of the scanning scheme and cannot achieve good performances for  both.   An advantage of the resonant micromirror over the quasistatic one is the large scanning angle  due to the large displacement under the resonant mode. One example of the resonant micromirror  was presented in [93] as the eye-type one-axis scanner.  It has an optical  scanning angle of 32°  when driven by sinusoidal voltage under the micromirror's resonant frequency in the range of 22.1  ~ 24.5 kHz with 100 V DC bias voltage. It is used together with a huge galvanometer mirror to  display an image with extended graphics array (XGA) resolution (1024 × 768) as shown in Fig.  1.13  (a),  which  will  significantly  increase  the  size  of  the  display  module.  A  biaxial  resonant  micromirror driven by vertical comb-drive was developed [26]. The micromirror was fabricated  using a dual layer polysilicon SOI process and was packaged in a vacuum package to improve the  scanning angle. Relative low driving voltage (60 V) is required for the fast axis to achieve large  optical scanning angle, i.e., 60°. The low driving voltage has advantages of high reliability and  compatibility with some consumer electronics. A 512 × 1024 pixel image is generated using the  micromirror, as shown in Fig. 1.13 (b).

  Fig. 1.14 Vector scanning graphics using 2-layer surface micromachined micromirror [108].  Quasistatic micromirrors are also widely studied. A vertical comb-drive driven micromirror  having an optical scanning angle of 16° for both axis was developed in [25]. A micromirror based  on electrostatic repulsive-force actuator [107] was previously used to display vector graphics, as  shown in Fig. 1.14 [108]. The measurements showed that the micromirror has an optical scanning  angle of ± 2.5° for both axes with the aid of a magnification lens. The maximum rotation angle is  achieved at 200 V DC which approaches the breakdown voltage of the insolation layer and may  cause a failure of the device. Usually by introducing magnification lens, the small rotation angles  widely  suffered  by  quasistatic  micromirrors  can  be  magnified.  For  example,  the  16°  optical  scanning angle in [25] can be amplified to about 120° using a customized fisheye lens. However,  there is an extra cost on the customization. The micromirror and the display results in [25] are  shown in Fig. 1.15.

Raster scanning display is capable of generating pixel image which is able to show much more  vivid information (as shown in Fig. 1.13) than that of the vector scanning display (as shown in Fig.  1.12(b), Fig. 1.14 and Fig. 1.15 (c)). However, raster scanning display comes with a limitation that  the brightness of the display is limited by the maximum laser power that can be used, which is  regulated by the laser safety standard [118], [119]. The reason is that in raster scanning display the  illuminance of the laser is evenly distributed to all the pixels over the entire display area. In order  to increase the average brightness of the display, laser source with much higher output power are  required.  It has been reported [120] that  the laser diodes which  are similar to the ones used in  optical drives are used for the LSD which could be in the ranges of serval tens to hundreds of  miliwatts. According to the laser safety classification specified by IEC 60825-1 standard [121],  the laser with this amount of output power will cause eye hazard if directly exposed. If accidentally  the  micromirror  encountered  a  failure,  the  laser  beam  will  be  concentrated  in  one  spot.  The  concentrated laser beam may shoot directly or be reflected to the viewer and may cause injury.  However, for vector scanning display all of the laser power is concentrated in one single point on  the scanned trajectory at one time instant. As a result, usually laser source with lower power can  be used [122]. It was reported in [109] that a less than 5 mW laser was used for a vector scanning  display.   For some applications such as the assembly guidance and automotive head up display, only  simple patterns are to be displayed. Vector scanning display is fully capable of such applications.  Also considering the vector display requires laser with much lower power than that of the raster  scanning  display,  the  micromirror  based  vector  scanning  display  is  ideal  for  such  applications.  16   

    Usually  low  cost  and  high  fabrication  yield  micromirror  is  desired  which  is  suitable  for  mass  production and can reduce the overall cost of the display module. As a result, the second objective  of the thesis is to develop a low cost micromirror for vector scanning display, which is based on  the actuator developed in the first objective.   1.3 Automotive head-up display (HUD) review The micromirror based vector display system can be used in assembly and tooling guidance  laser show (as shown in Fig. 1.12) and automotive HUD [109], [123]. In this thesis the micromirror  developed in objective 2 will be used to construct an automotive HUD.   HUD was first developed to help the pilots of fighters to aim at the target. The vector patterns  are reflected by the combiners and a virtual image is generated in front of the pilot's sight. Later  this technology was used on the civilian air planes to aid the pilots. In 1988, GM introduced this  technology  to  the  cars.  Nowadays,  a  lot  of  car  companies  have  provided  HUD  as  an  optional  package for their high end cars. It is a trend that HUD becomes a standard module of the cars. The  reasons can be concluded as follows. 1) With the development of the sensor technology, more and  more  driving  critical  information  are  provided  to  the  drivers  to  improve driving  safety.  2)  The  development of the networks is changing the way people communicate. As a result, drivers tend  to  be  exposed  to  a  large  amount  of  driving  irrelevant  information  such  as  calls,  text  or  voice  massages and massage from social media. All those information needs to be displayed properly so  that they do not interfere with the driving.   The conventional automotive HUD is mainly based on LCD which dominates the market. The  system setup of LCD based HUD is shown in Fig. 1.16. Some issues suffered by LCD limits its  application in automotive HUD. Firstly, it has low light efficiency which leads to low brightness  of the display. The light source of LCD is provided by backlit LEDs. However, most of the energy  are lost in the transmission through the polarizer, color filter and the aperture. As a result, about  only 7.7% of the total illuminance generated by the backlight can be illuminated from the display  [124]. Usually, a high brightness capability of the display module is required (> 15,000 cd/m2) so  that the display can be observed when there is a strong background illuminance such as driving in  the daylight. If the HUD does not have the capability to generate a display with high brightness,  as the background illuminance of the display increases, the displayed image will fuse with the  background and can hardly be observed. This is called "washout" of the display. Due to the low  17   

    energy efficiency, the image generated by LCD is not high enough to avoid the washout of the  image. This issue cannot be solved by simply increasing the power of the backlight which will  cause dramatic temperature increase of  the display  module [125]. Another issue  with the  LCD  based HUD is the tradeoff between the display size and the volume of the system. Since a virtual  image is  required to be generated in front of the driver about 2 m away, the size of the virtual  image needs to be large enough for the driver to see all details of the displayed information as  illustrated in Fig. 1.16. Usually the image generated by the picture generation unit such as LCD  needs to be about twice of the size of the virtual image. Furthermore, the relay optics must be even  larger than the image. In this case, a large display will lead to bulky HUD system. As a result, an  automotive HUD with low cost, compact size and simple structure is desired.  

  Fig. 1.16 A schematic view of the conventional HUD setup [126].  With the development of the display technologies, digital micromirror device (DMD), liquid  crystal on silicon (LCoS), organic light-emitting device (TOLED) and laser scanning light display  (LSD) are used to form compact HUD display modules. These technologies are able to overcome  the above mentioned limitations of LCD based HUD.   The digital micromirror device (DMD) is a micromirror array which has hundreds of thousands  of  tiny  micromirrors,  which  is  developed  by  Larry  [24].  Each  micromirror  is  actuated  by  electrostatic attractive force to have two stable states, i.e., 12° and -12° rotation which corresponds  to  on  and  off  position.  The  light  sources  is  provided  by  external  LEDs  or  lasers.  Its  working  principle is illustrated in Fig. 1.17. When the micromirror is at "on" position, the incident light is  directed to the projection lens of the system. While at "off" position, the light is directed to light  18   

    absorber which appears to be a dark pixel on the image. A DMD based display module has the  advantage of low power consumption, high energy efficiency, fast response time and long working  life. A simple prototype of DMD based HUD has been developed in [125]. A commercial DMD  based portable projector was used to generate the display image. A 7 inches virtual images lies  about 2.5 m in front of viewer's eye has been generated. Comparison has been made with the LCD  based HUD. The experiments show that the overheat issue exists when increasing the output power  of the backlight LEDs to generate a brighter image. However, the developed HUD is based on the  lab environment, which is a proof of concept. A commercial DMD based augmented reality (AR)  HUD [127] has been developed by a German automotive parts company Continential which is a  leader in automotive HUD industry. The company has claimed to bring this technology to series  production in 2016.

  Fig. 1.17 Working principle of DMD based display [128].  Liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) is an alternative to DMD. Its working principle combines the  mechanisms of LCD and DMD.  LCoS applies liquid crystal on reflective single crystal substrate.  By manipulating the open and close state of the liquid crystal, the incident light to the LCoS is  either  reflected  by  the  substrate  or  blocked  by  the  liquid  crystal.  It  has  advantages  of  high  resolution,  high  light  efficiency  and  high  contrast  ratio.  The  system  cost  and  volume  of  LCoS  based display module are similar to those of DMD. A phase-only LCoS device has been presented  in [124], [129]­[132] and has been used for an automotive holographic HUD system. It has been  equipped in Land Rover Evoque as shown in Fig. 1.18.

  Fig. 1.18 Display result of LCoS based HUD in Land Rover Evoque [133].  Although DMD and LCoS are good at displaying pixel images, they share a common weakness  of background glow. Background glow is related to the black-level control ability of the display  module. Since the displayed pattern of a HUD is composed of simple symbols, there is a large  amount of unused pixels. It is desired that there is no illumination from those pixels, i.e., black  pixels. However, DMD and LCoS based display cannot produce true black pixels due to residual  illuminance. Consequently the HUD based on them has a glowed background which may interfere  with the driving.  

  Fig. 1.19 HUD based on TOLED [134].  Transparent OLED (TOLED) due to its transparency are also used in automotive HUD. A real  image can be displayed on the surface of OLED panel as shown in Fig. 1.19. One limitation is the  non-transparency of the display background, which may interfere with the driving. Furthermore  20   

    OLED is limited by the low brightness. Although the brightness can be boosted by increasing the  power, it will reduce the working life of OLED. As a result, with the current development of the  OLED display technology, its application in automotive HUD is limited.

  Fig. 1.21 HUD based on the micromirror [122].    LSD  has  a  great  potential  for  automotive  HUD  application  since  it  shares  some  of  the 

advantages of DMD and LCoS such as low power consumption, small volume and high display  brightness [136]­[138]. Besides it does not suffer from background glow issue. Both raster and  vector scanning display HUDs have been developed. Raster scanning HUDs [135], [139], [140]  are developed based on a resonant micromirror presented in [9]. The micromirror and the HUD  prototype are shown in Fig. 1.20. The light source is provided by lasers diodes with 3 colors, i.e.,  red, green and blue, which are combined by beam combiner. The micromirror steers the reflected  laser beam to scan through a 2D area line by line. The lasers are modulated to generate colorful  displays. Besides of the raster scanning display, vector scanning display is also used in automotive  21   

    HUD  application  [25],  [109],  [123].  In  automotive  HUD  application,  only  simple  symbols  are  required to display the critical driving information which can be showed as vector graphics [141].  In this regard, the vector scanning display HUD is not limited by the lack of abilities to generate  pixel image. More important, the vector scanning display HUD requires laser source with much  lower  power  to  generate  the  display  with  similar  brightness  as  that  of  raster  scanning  display.  Consequently, the vector scanning display has a potential to be used in automotive HUD. A HUD  based on vector scanning is  developed in [25] using a 2D quasistatic micromirror. The display  result is shown in Fig. 1.21. The micromirror is actuated by vertical comb-drives, which is shown  in Fig. 1.15 (a). However, since the comb-drive actuator suffers from "pull-in" instability, it may  lead to device failure if exposed to large external vibrations. Another vector scanning display HUD  is  developed  in  [109],  [123]  which  use  a  quasistatic  micromirror  previously  developed  by  our  group [107]. The SEM image of the micromirror and HUD display result are shown in Fig. 1.22.  It shares the common advantages of vector scanning display such as low power consumption, small  volume and low requirement on the power of laser source to obtain high brightness display. Also,  the  micromirror  can  be  fabricated  using  commercial  2-layer  surface  micromachining  MUMPs  process,  which  is  mature  and  low  cost  compared  to  the  bulk  micromachining  process  used  to  fabricate vertical comb-drives. Moreover, it is actuated by repulsive-force actuators which do not  suffer from the "pull-in" instability and thus has high reliability. However, a small display pattern  was obtained attributed to the small optical scanning angle of the micromirror, i.e., ± 2.5° with the  aid of the magnification lens. Another issue is that the display has a relative large distortion and is  limited to low refreshing frequency i.e., about 30 Hz. Furthermore, the developed display module  was not integrated with the car to construct a real HUD system. The first two issues will be solved  in  objective  2  of  the  thesis  which  aims  to  develop  a  micromirror  based  on  the  repulsive-force  actuator  developed  in  objective  1.  Also  in  objective  2,  an  advanced  display  approach  will  be  developed to generate good quality displays in high refreshing frequency. The objective 3 of the  thesis is to construct a real HUD system in a car using the micromirror and advanced approach  developed in objective 2.

The thesis is to develop repulsive-force rotation actuators which are able to generate larger  repulsive  force/torque  than  that  of  previously  reported  repulsive-force  rotation  actuators.  The  actuators  to  be  developed  will  share  the  advantages  of  common  repulsive-force  actuators  over  attractive actuators, i.e., not suffering from the "pull-in" instability and the travel range not limited  by the gap between fixed and moving electrodes. In addition, the actuators to be developed will be  suitable for simple and matured surface micromachining process. The modeling, fabrication and  prototype testing will be conducted on the novel actuators to be developed.   Two actuators are developed in the following two published papers:   Chao Fan and Siyuan He, "A two-row interdigitating-finger repulsive-torque electrostatic  actuator  and  its  application  to  micromirror  vector  display",  IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, vol. 24, pp. 2049 ­ 2061, 2015.    Chao  Fan  and  Siyuan  He,  "A  microelectrostatic  repulsive-torque  rotation  actuator  with  two-width fingers", Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering, vol. 25, p. 095006,  2015.       23   

    Objective 2: The actuators that are developed in objective 1 will be used to drive a 2D scanning micromirror  which can be used for LSD. Objective 2 contains two sub-objectives.    Sub-objective  2-1):  A  2D  scanning  micromirror  will  be  developed  using  the  actuator  to  be  developed  in  objective  1.  The  micromirror  is  used  for  laser  vector  scanning  display.  The  micromirror is able to solve the issue of small display area and relative large display distortion  suffered by the previously reported micromirror.   Sub-objective 2-2): An advanced display approach is to be developed for vector laser display using  the  micromirror  developed  in  sub-objective  2-1.  Compared  to  the  previously  reported  generic  display  approach,  the  advanced  display  approach  is  able  to  achieve  better  display  quality  with  higher frequency and less display distortion. The advanced display approach is suitable for both  the  micromirror  of  this  thesis  and  previously  developed  micromirrors  with  improved  display  quality.   Objective 3: The micromirror developed in sub-objective 2-1) is to be used to construct an automotive headup  display  (HUD),  which  integrates  the  micromirror  laser  and  the  optics.  The  HUD  will  be  integrated in the car model in the lab.to form both the real image and virtual image HUDs.                       24   

   

Chapter 2 Two-row interdigitating-finger repulsive-torque electrostatic actuator
This chapter is based on the first part of the following published paper:  Chao Fan and Siyuan He, "A two-row interdigitating-finger repulsive-torque electrostatic actuator  and  its  application  to  micromirror  vector  display",  IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, vol. 24, pp. 2049 ­ 2061, 2015.     This  chapter  presents  a  novel  two-row  interdigitating-finger  (TRF)  repulsive-torque  electrostatic actuator which is able to achieve much larger out-of-plane rotation than the previously  developed one-row-finger (ORF) repulsive-force actuators. It meets the first objective of the thesis.  The TRF actuator consists of upper and lower rotation units and an output beam. Each unit has  one row of rotation fingers, i.e., the lower and upper rotation fingers, which interdigitate with each  other. The lower and upper rotation fingers are subject to different electric potentials. Each rotation  finger and its underneath aligned fixed finger are subject to the same electric potential. The actuator  generates repulsive torques to rotate the lower and upper fingers out-of-plane with the maximum  rotation not limited either by the gap between fingers and the substrate nor by the "pull-in" effect.  The output beam is connected to the lower row of rotation fingers and therefore the actuator has  the same rotation as the lower unit. The actuator requires only two thin films and is suitable for  surface  micromachining.  The  model  is  established  to  verify  the  actuator  and  calculate  its  performance.  Prototypes  are  fabricated  and  tested.  Experimental  results  show  that  the  actuator  achieved  a  mechanical  rotation  of  11.5  °  at  the  static  driving  voltage  of  150  V  and  a  resonant  frequency of 380 Hz with a sinusoidal driving voltage varying from 20 V to 70 V.   2.1 Design The  two-row  interdigitating-finger  actuator  (TRF)  consists  of  the  lower  and  upper  rotation  units, and an output beam as shown in Fig. 2.1. Each rotation unit has one row of rotation fingers,  i.e., the lower and upper rotation fingers which are interdigitated. The upper unit consists of upper  rotation  fingers,  upper  fixed  fingers,  upper  common  beam  and  upper  springs.  The  lower  unit  consists of lower rotation fingers, lower fixed fingers, lower common beam and lower springs. The  25   

    lower and upper rotation fingers are able to rotate about the lower and upper springs respectively.  A middle beam connected to the lower common beam is the output structure which has the same  rotation as the lower rotation fingers. The middle beam is connected to a mirror plate for measuring  the actuator's performance. The upper rotation unit has two identical parts located on both sides  of the middle beam. On each side of every rotation finger there is one interdigitated rotation finger.  Each aligned fixed fingers is aligned and underneath the rotation finger. Ideally, all fingers should  have the same width. The actuator can be fabricated using surface micromachining process such  as PolyMUMPs [112], i.e., Poly0 for lower and upper fixed fingers and Poly1 for lower and upper  rotation fingers. In order to meet the fabrication rules of PolyMUMPs and reduce undesired lateral  force [97], the rotation fingers are 5 µm narrower than the fixed fingers on each side.  The upper rotation and fixed fingers are subject to the electric potential of V1, while the lower  rotation and fixed fingers are subject to the potential of  V2. Electrostatic torque is generated on  both the lower and upper rotation fingers to rotate them out-of-plane and away from the substrate  in opposite direction. The repulsive-force on either the lower or upper rotation finger is the net  force by summing the electrostatic forces on the top and bottom surfaces of the finger caused by  the asymmetric electric field surrounding them as explained in [33], [35]-[37]. In the interdigitating  area, the upper fingers strengthen the electric fields surrounding the lower rotation fingers, which  therefore enhance the asymmetric fields caused net forces on the lower rotation fingers, either the  upper  fingers  are  lower,  the  same  height  or  higher  than  the  lower  rotation  fingers.  The  lower  rotation fingers have the same function to the upper rotation fingers.  The total width and length of the actuator are 1610 m × 714 m including pads. The 300 m  × 300 m mirror plate is connected to the 50 m wide middle beam. The middle beam separates  the upper rotation structure into 2 identical parts, each of which has the same dimension 750 m  × 581 m. Rotation fingers are 20 m wide and fixed fingers are 30 m wide. Rotation fingers  refer to both the lower and upper rotation fingers. Fixed fingers refer to both the lower and upper  fixed fingers.

Two coordinate systems, i.e., XlowerOlowerZlower and XupperOupperZupper are established with origins  Olower and Oupper located at the lower and upper pivoting points as shown in Figs. 2.1 and 2.2.   A few points are to be explained for Fig. 2.2. The part of the middle beam beyond the tip of  the lower fixed finger is not shown in Fig. 2.2 (b) since that part does not generate torque if the  fringing effect is not considered. The interdigitating area includes both lower and upper rotation  fingers. The non-interdigitating area includes only upper rotation fingers and the middle beam.  The  electrostatic  torques  acting  on  the  lower  and  upper  rotation  fingers  are  balanced  by  mechanical torques:     
Tlower ( l ,  u , V )  K lower   l   
Tupper ( l ,  u , V )  K upper   u

    - Where Tlower and Tupper are electrostatic torques acting on the lower and upper rotation fingers.   - Accordiong to the coordianate systems, positive values of Tlower and Tupper indicate that the torques  drive the lower and upper rotation fingers to rotate out-of-plane counter-clockwise and clockwise  respectively, i.e., the torque is repulsive.   - Klower and Kupper are rotational stiffnesses of the lower and upper rotation units.   - l and u are roation angles of the lower and upper rotation fingers. V is the driving voltage.  The objective of the modeling is to solve Eq. (2.1) and (2.2) to obtain roation angles of the  lower and upper rotation fingers for any given driving voltage V. Four steps are followed.  Step 1. Derive functions of torques exerted on lower and upper rotation fingers, i.e.,  Tlower and  Tupper. The torque functions include expressions of electrostatic forces exerted on lower and upper  rotation  fingers  in  cross  section  with  unit  length  and  unit  square  driving  voltage,  i.e.,  finterdigitating_lower, finterdigitating_upper and fnon-interdigitating_upper.   Where  finterdigitating_lower: Acting on the lower rotation fingers in the interdigitating area  finterdigitating_upper: Acting on the upper rotation fingers in the interdigitating area.  fnon-interdigitating_upper: Acting on the upper rotation fingers in the non-interdigitating area.  Step 2. Obtain functions of finterdigitating_lower, finterdigitating_upper and fnon-interdigitating_upper using numerical  simulations and polynomial surface fittings.   Step  3.  Obtain  stiffnesses  of  the  lower  and  upper  rotation  units,  i.e.,  Klower  and  Kupper  using  numerical simulation.   Step 4. Solve Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) by substituting above results into Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) to obtain  roatation angles of the lower and upper roation fingers.   2.2.2 Modeling Step 1. Derive funtions of torques exerted on lower and upper rotation fingers, i.e., Tlower and Tupper.   xl is the Xlower-axis coordinate of a point on the lower rotation finger. xu is the Xupper-axis coordinate  of a point on the upper rotation finger. The torques are calculated using equations:

In  Eqs.  (2.3)  and  (2.4),  the  positive  values  of  finterdigitating_lower, finterdigitating_upper  and  fnoninterdigitating_upper indicate the electrostatic forces pointing up and the negative values represent the 

forces  in  the  downward  direction.  For  any  non-unit  driving  voltage,  the  electrostatic  torque  is  proportional  to  V2.  xl is  the  distance  between  a  point  on  the  lower  rotation  finger  to  the  lower  pivoting point  Olower.  xu is the distance between a point on the upper rotation finger to the upper  pivoting point Oupper. xl and xu are the coordinates of two different points.   hl: In the interdigitating area,  hl is the vertical distance between lower rotation and lower fixed  fingers as shown in Figs. 2.2 (b) and 2.3 (applicable to finterdigitating_lower and finterdigitating_upper). In the  non-interdigitating area,  hl is the vertical distance between the middle beam and its underneath  lower fixed finger as shown in Fig. 2.2 (applicable to fnon-interdigitating_upper).   hu: In both interdigitating and non-interdigitating areas,  hu is the vertical distance between upper  rotation and upper fixed fingers as shown in Figs. 2.2 (b), 2.3 and 2.5.   In coordinate system XlowerOlowerZlower, hl and hu can be expressed as:

Obtain functions of finterdigitating_lower, finterdigitating_upper and fnon-interdigitating_upper   Functions of finterdigitating_lower, finterdigitating_upper and fnon-interdigitating_upper are obtained by numerical  simulations and polynomial surface fittings.   Step 2-1  finterdigitating_lower and finterdigitating_upper  finterdigitating_lower(hl, hu)  and  finterdigitating_upper(hl, hu)  are  forces  per  unit  finger  length  and  unit  square  driving  voltage  acting  on  the  lower  and  upper  rotation  fingers  respectively  in  the  cross  sections in the interdigitating area. Dimensions of the fingers and distances between fingers are  labeled in Fig. 2.3, which  shows only one  example of cross sections in the interdigitating area  where hu is not necessarily to be smaller than hl.  Electro V6.3 [142] software is used to simulate the electrostatic forces in the cross sections  using BEM or FEM. The simulation ranges of hl and hu in the interdigitating area are determined  using the method introduced in Appendix A as hl: 0 ~ 50 µm and hu: 0 ~ 50 µm. The step size of  hl and hu is 2 µm. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 2.4, which are fitted using polynomial  surfaces. The surface fittings use two-variable polynomials which are expressed as Eqs. (B1) and  (B2) in Appendix B.

The rotational stiffnesses of the lower and upper unit,  Klower and  Kupper, are obtained through  FEM  simulations  which  are  3.4×10-9  Nm/rad  and  8.5×10-9  Nm/rad  (sum  of  the  stiffnesses  of  2  identical parts).

    2.3 Performance evaluation 2.3.1 Rotation angle estimation and comparison with one-row-finger (ORF) actuator Substituting results of Step 1 ~ 3 into Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) there are only two unknowns i.e., l  and u, which can be solved. l can be obtained as shown in Fig. 2.7. The actuator torque, Tlower is  calculated  using  Eq.  (2.3)  with  the  results  shown  in  Fig.  2.8.  The  rotation  angle  of  the  upper  rotation fingers, u and the torque Tupper (Eq. (2.4)) can also be obtained with the results shown  in Fig. 2.9.   The modeling results show that both the torques exerted on lower and upper rotation fingers  are positive. Even when there are small negative forces in some cross sections as shown in Figs.  2.4 and 2.6, the torques obtained by integrating the multiplications of the forces in all cross sections  and the corresponding distances are positive. According to the coordinate systems established for  modeling, positive values of the torques indicate that the torques rotate the lower and upper fingers  out-of-plane  and  away  from  the  substrate  counter-clockwise  and  clockwise  respectively,  i.e.,  repulsive. The output structure of the actuator, i.e., the middle beam, is connected to the lower  common beam and has the same rotation as the lower rotation fingers, i.e.,  l. Thus the actuator  generates repulsive-torque and outputs out-of-plane rotation. The model predicts that the actuator  is able to output an out-of-plane mechanical rotation of 10.63º at 150V as shown in Fig. 2.7.

Fig. 2.9 Torque and rotation angle of the upper rotation fingers.  The  two-row  interdigitating-finger  repulsive-torque  actuator  developed  in  this  chapter  is  compared to the previously reported ORF rotation actuator [97], [105], which is designed using  the same area, stiffness and driving voltage of the actuator developed in this chapter following the  optimization  method  presented  in  [105].    The  comparison  results  show  that  the  TRF  actuator  developed in this chapter can generate a much higher torque and then a much larger rotation angle  than that of the ORF actuator, e.g., the improvement is 75% at 50 V, 84.2% at 100 V and 84.5%  at 150 V respectively.     The model developed in the previous section are also used to study the effect of the total length 

of the actuator to its static performance using the model developed in the previous sections. There  are some conditions of this study:  (1) The finger width is fixed to be 20 µm which is the same as the actuator presented in above  sections.  (2) The total width of the actuator stays unchanged which is 1610 µm  (3)  The  ratio  of  the  lower  and  upper  finger  is  fixed  to  be  3  which  is  the  same  as  the  actuator  presented above. It is noted that the length of the finger is counted from the fingertip to the root of  the finger where it connects with the common beam.  

35   

    (4) The dimensions of all the springs, the pad and the common beams are the same as the actuator  presented above.     The finger lengths of the actuator presented in the previous section is used as a reference. A 

serious of scale factors from 0.2 to 1.2 with 0.2 increment are used to scale the finger lengths of  both lower and upper fingers. The total length of the actuator changes with the finger lengths For  comparison purpose, the performance of previously developed one-row-finger actuator (ORF) of  the same length as  each  variant of the  TRF  actuator is  evaluated. Different from TRF actuator  whose finger width is fixed to be 20 µm, the finger width of the ORF actuator is optimized using  the method presented in [105] to generate maximum out-of-plane rotation at 150 V.     The calculated rotation angles of ORF actuator and two-row-finger actuator are plotted in Fig. 

2.10. The rotation angles of TRF and ORF actuators verse the driving voltages are   denoted as  black solid and grey dotted curves respectively. It can be concluded that the rotation angle of both  the ORF and TRF actuators increase with the increase of the actuator length. The increase of the  rotation angle of the TRF actuator is much more than that of the ORF actuator. It can be seen that  the rotation angles of the ORF are clustered together which indicate that the increase of the total  length of the actuator does not lead to significant improvement of the rotation angles. The curves  of the TRF actuator are all above that of the ORF actuator except when the scale is smaller than  0.4 (the total length of the actuator is smaller than 430 µm). This is because that the dimensions of  the  pad  and  the  springs  are  constant  and  when  the  total  length  of  the  actuator  is  small,  the  dimensions of the upper pads and upper springs are comparable to the total length of the actuator  and they cannot generate out-of-plane torque. While the area taken by the upper pads and springs  are used to generate out-of-plane torque by the ORF actuator. However, it is worth noting that for  some applications such as micromirror the total length of the actuator is usually large and the TRF  actuator is always superior over the ORF actuator.

Fig. 2.10 Rotation angles of TRF actuator and ORF actuator at various actuator lengths.  2.3.2 Dynamic response estimation by numerical simulation Since there are two rotation units in the two-row finger actuator presented in this chapter, the  resonant frequency of the actuator (factuator) is the smaller value among the resonant frequency of  lower rotation unit (flower) and the resonant frequency of the upper rotation unit (fupper). Generally  the actuator is connected to an operation structure through its lower row of rotation fingers, e.g., a  1D micromirror plate such as the design in Sections II~IV, or a 2D micromirror plate such as the  design in Section V. Subsequently the lower rotation unit has high moment of inertia and then a  low  resonant  frequency,  i.e.,  much  lower  than  that  of  the  upper  rotation  unit.  Thus  factuator  is  normally  equal  to  flower.  The  lower  rotation  unit  includes  lower  springs,  lower  rotation  fingers,  lower common beam, the middle beam and the operation structure such as the mirror plate. In the  actuator in Sections II~VI, the lower rotation unit has the resonant frequency of 557 Hz with the  resonant mode shown in Fig. 2.11 and the upper rotation unit has the resonant frequency of 1.59  KHz. It is noticed that the middle beam has a slight deformation, i.e., the beam bends along its 

37   

    length relative to its  root  end connecting the lower common beam due  to the large moment of  inertia of the mirror plate attached to the middle beam.

  Fig. 2.13 Experiment setup for measuring the rotation of the actuator.  2.4 Prototype and performance testing The prototype is fabricated using PolyMUMPs, as shown in Fig. 2.12. Both static and dynamic  performances of the prototypes are measured. The testing setup is shown in Fig. 2.13. A laser beam  shoots onto the mirror plate attached to the middle beam. The actuator is packaged in a CQFP44  chip and is mounted on an actuator fixture which is installed on one tilting stage and two linear  translation stages. A display screen is attached with a grid paper. The stages are to ensure: 1) the  39   

    mirror plate is perpendicular to the optical bench; and 2) the incident and reflected laser beam are  parallel to the optical bench. A function generator and a voltage amplifier are used to drive the  actuator.  2.4.1 Static performance Static performance refers to the rotation angles of the actuator when subjected to different DC  voltages. In the test, DC voltages from 0 to 150 V with 5 V increment are applied to the actuator.  The actuator steers the reflected laser beam and changes the location of the laser spot on the screen  as it rotates. The optical and then mechanical rotation of the actuator is calculated by measuring  the displacement of the laser spot on the display screen.     In order to relate the tilt angle of the mirror plate with the laser spot displacement on the display 

screen it is necessary to convert the 3D optical geometry into a 2D problem. The schematic top  view of the optical geometry is shown in Fig. 2.14. To convert the 3D optical geometry into a 2D  problem, the virtual plane composed of the incident laser beam and the reflected laser beam needs  to be guaranteed to be parallel to the optical breadboard. It only needs to be guaranteed that two  lines on the plane, i.e., OO1 and O1O2 are parallel with the optical breadboard separately.

  Fig. 2.14 Schematic top view of the optical geometry.    First, line  OO1 is considered to be parallel to the optical breadboard by the optomechanical 

components used to fix the laser. This is verified by measuring the angle between  OO1 and the  optical breadboard by using the Position Sensing Detector (PSD). The PSD is used because it can  measure the tiny shift of the laser spot on its active sensing area. The schematic setup of measuring  the incident beam angle with respect to the optical breadboard is shown in Fig. 2.15. As shown in  Fig. 2.15, the PSD is positioned in at two different locations in front of the incident laser path, O1  and  O'1. Line  OO1O'1 is the projection line of the actual beam path of  OAB and is parallel to the  40   

    optical  breadboard.  The  actual  laser  path  OAB  is  assumed  to  have  an  inclination  angle    with  OO1O'1, which can be calculated by Eq. (2.13).

Where  BC  is  the  vertical  displacement  of  the  laser  spot  measured  by  PSD  by  moving  it  from  location AO1 to BO'2. O1O'1 is the distance between the two locations of the PSD. The angle   is  calculated  to  be  0.4  which  is  a  small  enough  value  to  consider  the  incident  laser  beam  to  be  approximately parallel with the optical breadboard. The vertical position of the laser spot B on the  PSD is recorded in position AO1.     Then it needs to be guaranteed that line O1O2 is also parallel with the optical breadboard. Then 

the PSD is moved to the reflected laser path O2 the vertical position of the laser spot on the PSD  is denoted as B. If vertical positions of B and B' are the same, it can be improved that O1O2 is also  parallel with the optical breadboard. However, due to assembly and installation error, the plane of  the micromirror plate is  not perpendicular to the optical breadboard and as a result the vertical  position of B and B are different at this time. The tilting stage as shown in Fig. 2.13 is used to tune  the pitch angle of the test fixture so that  B  has the same vertical positions as that of  B. At this  point the line  O1O2 is tuned to be parallel with the optical breadboard and furthermore the plane  constructed of the incident and reflected laser beam is also parallel with the optical breadboard.  As a result, the 2D geometry shown in Fig. 2.16 can be used to analyze the relationship of the  displacement of the laser beam on the screen (shown in Fig. 2.12) with the rotation angle of the  actuator.   41

Fig. 2.16 Schematic top view of the geometry relationship between the tilt angle of the mirror  plate and the displacement of the laser spot on the screen.    In Fig. 2.16, line  AO is the incident laser beam and intersect with the mirror plate at point  O 

when no driving voltage is applied to the actuator. Line OB is the reflected laser beam and intersect  with the paper screen at point B. OF is the normal line of the mirror plate when it is at rest position.  The incident angle is . The incident laser beam AO intersect with the mirror plate at point O after  the mirror rotate an angle of  from its rest position. Line OF is the normal line of the mirror plate  at the tilted position. At the tilted position the laser is reflected along line OC and intersects with  the display screen at point  C.  OD is a construction line which is parallel with  OC and intersect  with the paper screen at point D. OG is a construction line which is perpendicular with OD. CE is  the construction line which is parallel with OG and they have equal length. It can be proved that  in the triangular OBD, the angle BOD is equal to twice of the rotation angle of the mirror plate,  i.e., 2. In this case,  can be calculated using Eq. (2.14):

(2.14) 

However in Eq. (2.14),  BD cannot be measured directly. Alternatively, BD can be proved to 

be approximately equal to BC with negligible error. It can be proved from Eq. (2.15) ~ (2.18) that  if the radius of the mirror, i.e.,  r, plate is much smaller than the distance from the center of the  42   

    mirror plate to the display screen and the incident laser angle  is relatively small BC and BD can  be considered close enough so that BC can replace the value of BD in Eq. (2.14).     In the experiment, the radius of the mirror plate is 0.15 mm, OB is 340 mm and  is 13.75°. In 

this case, the maximum ratio of  BC with  BD is 99.97%. This means it is reasonable that  BC can  be used as an approximate value of BD.

The measured static performance of the actuator is shown in Fig. 2.7. Multiple actuators (3) 

are measured under the same setup and it has been proved that the rotation angles are consistent  with different actuators fabricated in the same run. The experimental test shows that the two-row  interdigitating-finger repulsive-torque actuator can achieve a mechanical rotation angle of 11.5 °  at  150  V.  The  discrepancy  between  the  model  results  and  the  experimental  results  could  be  attributed  to  that  the  model  does  not  consider  the  electrostatic  torques  generated  between  the  common beams and the finger tips.  2.4.2 Dynamic performance Different  from  the  static  display  which  uses  a  display  screen  to  manually  record  the  displacement of the laser spot, a PSD is used in the dynamic performance test, which is able to  measure the laser spot displacement on its sensing area. The reason that PSD is not used for static  measurement is that large voltages (0 ~ 150 V) is applied to the actuator which lead to a large laser  43   

    displacement. Due to the small size of the sensing area of PSD which is 10 mm ×10 mm, it cannot  fit it the large displacement no matter how close the PSD positioned to the actuator. However for  dynamic test, the dynamic behavior of the actuator cannot captured by display screen. As a result,  a relatively smaller peak to peak driving voltage (20 ~ 70 V) compared to the ones (e.g., 0 ~ 150  V) used in static test is applied to the actuator in dynamic performance tests, to ensure the laser  scanning area is smaller than the PSD sensing area.

    In dynamic performance test, a sinusoidal voltage varying from 20 V ~ 70 V is applied. The  frequency response is measured using PSD and is shown in Fig. 2.17. The input driving voltage  signals  and  the  output  voltage  signals  form  the  PSD  are  used  to  construct  the  bode  plot.  The  measured resonant frequency is 380 Hz. The discrepancy between the simulations (557 Hz) and  testing results could be that the air damping due to squeeze film effect is not considered in the  simulation. Also the middle beam slightly deforms during the actuation due to the large moment  of inertial of the mirror plate attached to it. This deformation is counted in the measured frequency  response.    2.5 Summary A novel electrostatic repulsive-torque actuator which has two rows of interdigitating rotation  fingers has been presented in this chapter. The actuator is able to generate large repulsive-torque  and achieve an out-of-plane rotation with large angle and high reliability by avoiding the "pull-in"  instability.  The  actuator  requires  only  requires  two  thin  layers  and  is  suitable  for  surface  micromachining. The mathematical model has been established to verify the actuator and evaluate  its performance. The model is a hybrid approach based on 2D electric field numerical simulation  and analytical equations. The modeling methodology is concluded into four steps and may serve  as a reference approach to develop models for other electrostatic actuators with similar structures.  The developed model provides a way to fast predict the static performance (rotation angle under  DC  voltage)  of  the  actuator  and  is  able  to  give  the  solutions  for  any  given  driving  voltage  in  seconds. While it will take hours or days to get a solution if using numerical simulation. Even so  when the driving voltage is relatively high ( 100 V) the coupled solver of the simulation software  cannot converge and provides an inaccurate solution. Using the developed model, the actuator is  able to achieve about 10.6° rotation angle. Also the rotation angle and repulsive torques generated  by the TRF actuator is compared with the previously developed ORF actuator which is proved to  have a nearly 100% improvement.     The dynamic performance of the actuator is simulated using simulation software and the effect  of the upper and lower moving part on the resonant frequency of the actuator has been analyzed  which provides a good guidance in designing similar actuator with frequency response restrictions.    Prototypes have been fabricated and tested. The measured mechanical rotation angle is 11.5 °  for a driving voltage of 150 V. The resonant frequency is measured to be 380 Hz using optical  45   

    methods. The model  of the actuator shows a  good match with the experimental  results  even at  large driving voltages. The presented actuator has the potential to be used in 2D micromirrors and  is expected to have much larger scanning angle and faster dynamic response than the micromirror  based on previously developed ORF actuator.

Chapter 3 Two-width-finger repulsive-torque electrostatic actuator
This chapter is based on the following published paper:  Chao Fan and Siyuan He, "A microelectrostatic repulsive-torque rotation actuator with two-width  fingers", Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering, vol. 25, pp. 095006, 2015.     In this chapter, a micro electrostatic repulsive-torque rotation actuator with two-width fingers  is presented which is able to achieve large out-of-plane rotation. It meets the first objective of the  thesis. The actuator consists of finger shape electrodes and is made of two thin film layers, i.e.,  one movable layer and one fixed layer. There are two types of finger electrodes, i.e., the constant  width and the two-width fingers. The two-width finger has a narrow lower segment and a wide top  segment. The constant width finger has only the narrow lower segment. Each rotation finger has  its  corresponding  aligned  and  unaligned  fixed  fingers.  The  electrostatic  repulsive-torque  is  generated and acts on the rotation fingers to rotate them up and away  from the substrate. As a  result, the rotation is not limited by the gap between the movable and fixed layers and the "pullin" instability is avoided. Thus a large out-of-plane rotation and high operation stability can be  achieved. The actuator is suitable for two-layer surface micromachining. The model of the actuator  is developed. Prototypes are fabricated and tested. The experimental tests show that the actuator  achieved a mechanical rotation of 7.65 ° at a driving voltage of 150 V. The settling time for a  mechanical rotation of 5 ° is 5.7 ms.    3.1 Design 3.1.1 Structure   The actuator consists of constant-width rotation fingers, two-width rotation fingers, aligned 

fixed  fingers  and  unaligned  fixed  fingers,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.1.  Each  of  the  two-width  finger  consists of a lower narrow segment and a top wide segment. The aligned fixed fingers (constantwidth and two-width) are aligned with the corresponding rotation fingers. All rotation fingers are  connected to a common beam. A micro mirror plate is connected to the middle rotation finger for  measuring the rotation angle. Two serpentine springs are connected to the common beam. There  47   

    are  10  constant-width  rotation  fingers  and  7  two-width  rotation  fingers.  Rotation  fingers  and  aligned  fixed  fingers  are  subject  to  the  same  electric  potential  while  the  unaligned  fingers  are  subject  to a different electric potential. The repulsive-torque is  generated  on rotation fingers to  rotate them up and away from the fixed fingers without suffering from the "pull-in" instability.

  (b)  Fig. 3.1 Two-width finger actuator. (a) The actuator is at initial position. (b) The actuator is in  operation.   The  central  four  constant-width  rotation  fingers  are  of  25  µm  shorter  than  the  other  six  constant-width rotation fingers in order to use that 25 µm as the horizontal electrode connecting  the lower and upper segments of the two-width fingers beside the middle beam. As a result, the  top wide segment does not need to sacrifice its length to leave space for the horizontal connection  48   

    electrode in order to have the same length as that of the top wide segment of the rest two-width  rotation fingers.  3.1.2 Working principle The repulsive-force can be generated on all rotation fingers according to the analysis in [97].  It has been analyzed in [105] that the repulsive-force decreases along the finger length when the  actuator rotates with decreasing rate inversely related to the finger width. Detailed explanation can  be found in [97]. In a repulsive-force rotation actuator with one-width finger as those previously  reported in [97], [105], [107] the repulsive-force decreases along the finger length and approaches  to zero at the top part of each rotation finger when the rotation angle is large. Thus the top part of  the finger has no contribution to the total torque. If the top part becomes wider than the bottom  part, i.e., the finger has two widths along its length, the repulsive-force on the top part does not  decrease to zero because of the slower force decreasing rate due to its wider finger width. As a  result, a higher total repulsive-torque and then rotation angle can be obtained. The quantitative  modeling will be presented in the next section.  The actuator includes the lower and top parts. Each  part  has  the  same  elementary  cell  as  that  in  the  one-width  repulsive-force  actuators  previously  reported [97], [105], [107]. The "repulsive-force" exerted on the rotation fingers is the net force  after summing the forces on both the bottom and top surfaces. Detailed explanation on how the  parameters of fingers and distance between fingers affect the actuator performance can be found  in the references [97], [105], [107].

    3.2 Modeling A coordinate system XYZ is built with the origin located at the pivoting points (see Fig. 3.1(b))  as shown in Fig. 3.2. The pivoting points are selected to be at the center of the spring. X-axis is  along  the  finger  length  direction.  Y-axis  is  along  the  common  beam  length  direction.  Actuator  parameters are listed in Table. 3.1.   The following explain variables (see Fig. 3.1(a) and Fig. 3.2).      L and W: Overall length and width of the actuator.  Wwide and  Wnarrow: Finger widths of wide and narrow segments of two-width rotation finger. The  finger width of constant-width finger is the same as that of the lower narrow segment of two-width  rotation finger.   L0: Distance from the pivoting point, i.e., origin O, to the upper edge of the common beam where  it connects the rotation fingers.  g: The gap between the upper edge of the common beam and the lower edge of unaligned fixed  fingers.   LCon: The length of the constant-width rotation finger, which is defined from its tip to the upper  edge of the common beam.  LCon uses the finger length of four central constant-width fingers for  all  ten  constant-width  fingers.  The  inaccuracy  caused  decreases  from  the  low  to  high  driving  voltage, e.g., the difference between the calculation using the long constant-width fingers' length  and the calculation using the short constant-width fingers' length is about 10% ~ 1% when the  driving voltage varies from 0 V to 150 V. The real value should be higher than the calculation  using short finger length and lower than the calculation using long finger length. Such that the  inaccuracy is estimated to be less than 10% ~ 1% when the driving voltage varying from 0 V to  150 V.           LMid: The distance from the upper boundary of the middle part (shown in Fig. 3.3) to the upper  edge of the common beam.   LTwN: The length of the narrow segment of the two-width rotation finger, which is defined from its  connecting point with the common beam to the intersection of the wide and narrow segments.

    LTw: The length of the two-width rotation finger which is defined from its tip to the upper edge of  the common beam.  : The rotation angle of rotation fingers.    x: X-axis coordinate of a cross section (such as the one cut by the line AA' in Fig. 3.1(b) and Fig.  3.7).  h: The vertical distance from the tilted rotation finger to its initial position.

    The electrostatic torque  exerted on rotation fingers  includes three parts, i.e., torques on the  lower, middle and upper parts as shown in Fig. 3.3. The lower part includes constant-width rotation  fingers and the lower narrow segments of the two-width fingers. The upper part is composed of all  top wide segments of the two-width fingers. The middle part includes the parts between the lower  and upper parts of two-width rotation fingers. The small segments at the top of six longer constantwidth fingers in the middle part are neglected in the modeling  as shown  in Fig. 3.3  (a).  In the  middle part the approximation as shown in Fig. 3.3 (b) is made to calculate the electrostatic forces  exerted on the narrow segments of two-width rotation fingers. The approximation is based on the  analysis in [97], which explains the force on the rotation finger from the adjacent unaligned fixed  fingers is mainly from the edge of the unaligned fixed finger. The electrostatic torques exerted on  the lower, middle and upper parts are denoted as TL, TM, and TU respectively.   In static operation, the electrostatic repulsive-torque acting on the rotation fingers is balanced  by the mechanical restoring torque as expressed in Eq. (3.1).

Where Krotation is the rotational stiffness of the actuator which can be obtained from simulation.  In the stiffness simulation based on FEM, a mechanical upward force is applied to the tips of twowidth rotation fingers as shown in Fig. 3.4. The simulated stiffness is the rotation stiffness about  Y-axis  (see  Fig.  3.1(b).  The  long  common  beam  slightly  bends  in  operation,  i.e.,  the  vertical  displacement of the middle part is not the same as its two ends. The stiffness simulated using the  current method does not only include the stiffness of the springs and common beam structure, but  also the stiffness of each two-width rotation finger even its stiffness is much  higher (a few times)  than that of the springs and common beam structure. The Coventorware software is used for the  simulation  and  the  mesh  size  convergence  has  been  studied.  The  structure  stiffness  versus  the  number of elements is plotted in Fig. 3.5. N is the number of element of the coarsest mesh which  is 3364. It can be seen that the simulation result tend to converge when the mesh size is set to about  12 times of N.  The corresponding stiffness obtained is about 3.8×10-9 Nm/rad.

Where fL, fM and fU are the cross section electrostatic forces on the lower, middle and upper parts  respectively with unit driving voltage.   The cross sections are shown in Fig. 3.6 (a), (b) and (c), which are not to scale. Only a few  fingers are shown in the figure and the periodical structure repeats in both directions. Only half of  the middle part cross section is plotted and the other half is symmetrical. There are total 17 rotation  fingers in lower part and 7 rotation fingers in middle and upper parts. The rotation fingers are 0.75  m away from the fixed fingers which is the height of the dimples in PolyMUMPs [112]. Electro  software [142] is used to perform 2D electric field simulations. h is the vertical displacement of a  point on rotation fingers to their initial positions when the actuator is at rest. The ranges of h used  for the simulations are different for the lower, middle and upper parts. In order to determine the  range of h,  (the actuator rotation angle) range needs to be estimated.  range needs to be estimated  as large as possible to make h range wide enough for simulation. From the experimental test,  is  less than 9°. Thus the range of   is taken as 0 ° ~ 9 °. Ranges of  h can then be determined using  Eq. (3.5) for each part, e.g.,  h  [0, 33um ] for the lower part,  h  [0, 48um] for the middle part and 
h  [0, 95 um ]  for  the  upper  part.  The  range  of  x  for  the  lower,  middle  and  upper  parts  can  be

R-square is used as  the fitting criteria. The orders of polynomials for fL, fM and fU are selected so that the R-square for  each fitting is larger than 0.99.

Fig. 3.7 Fitting curves and simulation data.  After substituting Eq. (3.5) into Eqs. (3.6) ~ (3.8), fL, fM and fU are functions of . Substituting  the resultant equations into Eq. (3.1), the rotation angle of the actuator can be solved for any given  driving  voltage.  The  corresponding  electrostatic  torque  on  the  rotation  fingers  can  be  obtained  from Eqs. (3.2) ~ (3.4).  3.3 Performance evaluation 3.3.1 Rotation angle estimation The rotation angle of the actuator calculated according to the model is plotted in Fig. 3.8 (a),  which  shows  the  two-width-finger  (TWF)  actuator  developed  in  this  chapter  can  generate  a  mechanical  rotation  of  6.74  °  at  150  V.  The  ORF  actuator  is  designed  using  the  optimization  method in [105] with the same stiffness and actuator area as those of the actuator presented in this  56   

    chapter. The percentage of error between the calculated rotation angles of the TWF actuator and  the previously developed ORF actuator is shown in Fig. 3.8 (b). It can be concluded that over the  entire applied voltage range of 0 V to 150 V, the TWF actuator has larger rotation angles especially  when the voltage is high (> 30 V). The largest improvement happens in the voltage range 50 V ~  60  V  which  is  22.6%.  At  the  voltage  150V  which  is  the  maximum  voltage  used  for  tests,  the  improvement is about 19.2%.   3.3.2 Dynamic response estimation Modal analysis is performed using Coventorware software [143]. The first, second and third  mode are 392 Hz, 1246 Hz, and 1479 Hz respectively. The first mode deformation is shown in Fig.  3.9. The desired operation of the actuator is the first mode which rotate with respect to the two  springs at the bottom. The resonant frequency found for the first mode is without considering the  effect of air damping. It can be observed from Fig. 3.9 that the middle beam has a slightly different  deflection with the other fingers. It is because that there is a narrow segment in the middle beam  and a relative large mirror plate is attached to the end.

Fig. 3.10 Calculated rotation angles when LCon is set to the length of the 4 fingers in the center  and 6 finger on the side separately.  It  was  mentioned  in  section  3.2  that  due  to  the  design  requirement,  the  length  of  the  10  constant-width fingers are slightly different, i.e., the central 4 constant-width fingers are 25 µm  shorter  than  the  other  6  constant-width  fingers.  This  is  simplified  in  the  modeling  process  by  assuming all 10 fingers have the same length and  Lcon is equal to the length of 4 central fingers.  The error caused by this assumption can be estimated using the developed model. This can be done  by using different values of Lcon in the model and calculate the resultant rotation angles. As a result,  the length of both the central 4 fingers and the other 6 fingers are used in the model separately to  obtain the corresponding rotation angles for voltage changing from 0 to 150 V. The calculated  results are plotted in Fig. 3.10.   From  Fig. 3.10  it  can be  concluded that  using the finger length of the 6  longer fingers  can  achieve larger rotation angles than that achieved using the shorter finger length. But the difference  is very small. The maximum difference between the two curves is about 10% which happens when  the driving voltage is smaller than 20 V. The calculated results are two extremes conditions and  the real rotation angles with different length of constant-width finger should lie between the two.  As a result, it can be concluded that using the length of the 4 central fingers to represent the finger  length of all constant-width fingers leads to ~ 10% error at low voltage and 5% at 60 V and <3%  59   

    at 100 V. Normally the driving voltage is high (>100 V) for most of applications using this actuator,  that leads to negligible errors due to the approximation of  LCon. The approximation of  LCon can  significantly simplify the complexity of modeling   3.4 Prototype and performance testing

using commercial surface micromachining process, i.e., PolyMUMPs [112]. In order to comply  60   

    with the fabrication rule and avoid undesired lateral force [97], the aligned fixed finger is 5 m  larger  on  each  side  than  the  corresponding  rotation  finger.  Only  Poly0  and  Poly1  layers  in  PolyMUMPs are used. The SEM image of the prototype is shown in Fig. 3.11.    3.4.1 Static performance The rotation angles of the actuator under various DC driving voltages are tested using the setup  shown in Fig. 3.12. A red laser is used to focus the laser beam on the micro mirror plate of the  actuator. Linear stages are used to adjust the micro mirror plate to be perpendicular to the optical  bench. A grid paper is used as the display screen which is perpendicular to the reflected laser beam  to record the displacement of the laser spot under various driving voltages. The rotation angle is  calculated by knowing the laser spot displacement on the display screen and the distance between  the screen and the actuator. A function generator is used to generate the testing signal which is  amplified by a voltage amplifier to drive the actuator.

The rotation angles are shown in Fig. 3.8, which  shows that the actuator is able to achieve a mechanical rotation of 7.65 °. Multiple actuators (3)  are measured under the same setup and it has been proved that the rotation angles are consistent  with different actuators fabricated in the same run. The discrepancy between experimental results  and model results at 150 V is 11.8%. which is possibly attributed to the following sources: 1) The  geometry is approximated in 2D electric field simulation when simulating the middle part of the  actuator; 2) The rotation finger tips, the common beam (see Fig. 3.1(b)) and the part of the middle  61   

    beam beyond the location aligned with the other rotation finger tips are not included in the model  when calculating the total torque. That lowers the rotation torque and then rotation angle in the  model  results;  and  3)  In  the  measurement  setup  the  reflected  laser  beam  cannot  be  perfectly  perpendicular to the display screen, which causes error of increasing the measured rotation angle.   3.4.2 Dynamic performance

In  dynamic  test,  sinusoidal  driving  voltages  range  between  10V  to  60V  with  different  frequencies are applied to the TWF actuator. The response of the laser displacement is measured  using PSD similar to the measurement performed in chapter 2 for TRF actuator. The Bode plot is  shown in Fig. 3.13. The input driving voltage signals and the output voltage signals form the PSD  62   

    are used to construct the bode plot. The underdamped resonant frequency of the actuator is around  300 Hz smaller than the simulation result which is 392 Hz without considering the air damping  effect.  It  has  been  analyzed  in  section  3.3.2  that  the  deflection  of  the  middle  beam  is  slightly  different from the other fingers. The measured frequency response is only for the middle beam and  the other fingers will have a slight different frequency response.

Fig. 3.14 Step response of the actuator from 0 to 5° for a driving voltage of 76 V.   The step response is also measured using the same setup as the frequency response. The PSD  is able to measure the position of the reflected laser beam on its sensing area in real time. Then the  real time rotation angle of the actuator can be calculated by knowing the displacement of the laser  spot on the PSD and the distance between PSD and actuator. When the driving voltage is 76 V,  the mechanical rotation angle is 5 ° and the laser spot almost reaches the edge of the PSD sensing  area (10 mm × 10 mm). If the driving voltage is greater than 76 V, the actuator rotates more and  the reflected laser beam moves out of the PSD sensing area. Thus the step response measurement  using PSD is limited to 76 V. In static rotation measurements, the laser beam is displayed on a grid  paper without moving limitation. The step response is shown in Fig. 3.14. At the beginning of the  actuation, the rotation angle has a small negative undershoot. This is due to the possible fact that    the system is a non-minimum phase system. The rise time (10% ~ 90% of the final steady state    value), peak time and settling time (2% steady state error) are denoted as Tr, Tp and Ts which are  0.7 ms, 2.0 ms and 5.7 ms respectively. The percentage overshoot is 29.8%. The simulation shows  that the middle beam deforms in dynamic vibration, i.e., bending along the length relative to its  63   

    root end which connects to the common beam due to the large moment of inertia of the mirror  plate.  Therefore  the  step  response  performance  also  includes  the  effect  due  to  the  dynamic  deformation of the middle beam and mirror plate structure.  3.5 Summary An electrostatic repulsive-torque actuator with two-width fingers is presented in this chapter.  It has a simple two-layer structure and can be fabricated using two-layer surface micromachining  process. The actuator can generate large out-of-plane rotation and avoid the "pull-in" instability.  The model is developed. Prototypes are fabricated and tested. Experimental results show that the  actuator is able to achieve a static mechanical rotation of 7.65°, which is much larger than that of  the previously reported ORF actuator of the same size and stiffness. Also the roation angle of the  presented  acuator  is  either  better  or  comparable  to  those  of  reported  out-of-plane  combdrive  actuator. For example, a maximum rotation angle of 6.2° is measured with the combdrive actuated   micromirror in [57]. The micromirror driven by the combdrive actuator can rotate 2.3° in [23].  However the reported comb drive actuated micromirrors need microfabrication processes which  are more complex and costly than the two-layer surface micromachining process used to fabricate  the  actuator  presented  in  this  chapter.  The  step  response  is  measured  for  the  two-width  finger  actuator with settling time of 5.7 ms for a mechanical rotation of 5°.                                64   

   

Chapter 4 Micromirror driven by the two-row interdigitating-finger actuator for vector display
Section 4.1 is based on Section V of the following published paper:  Chao Fan and Siyuan He, "A two-row interdigitating-finger repulsive-torque electrostatic actuator  and  its  application  to  micromirror  vector  display",  IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, vol. 24, pp. 2049 ­ 2061, 2015.       From the testing, it has been proved that the fabricated TWF actuator is able to achieve about 

36%  larger  rotation  angle  than  that  of  the  ORF  actuator  of  the  same  size  at  150  V.  Also  the  fabricated TRF actuator is able to improve the rotation angle by nearly 100% over the ORF actuator  of the same size at 150 V. Since the two-row repulsive-torque electrostatic actuator presented in  Chapter 2 is able to achieve larger rotation angle than the two-width repulsive-torque electrostatic  actuator presented in Chapter 3, it is used to drive a 2D micromirror in this chapter which is the  second objective of the thesis. Four TRF actuators are used to integrate with a mirror plate to form  a  2D  scanning  micromirror.  The  working  principle  of  the  micromirror  is  introduced.  The  micromirror is fabricated using PolyMUMPs and the performance of the micromirror is tested and  compared  with  the  previously  presented  micromirror  based  on  ORF  actuators.  Then  the  static  (rotation  angle)  and  dynamic  performance  (step  and  frequency  response)  of  the  micromirror  driving by a proposed driving method has been tested.  4.1 Micromirror for vector display 4.1.1 Micromirror driven by the TRF actuator   Since the two-row interdigitating-finger actuator has the larger out-of-plane rotation between 

the two actuators developed in chapter 2 and 3, it is used to actuate a 2D scanning micromirror.  Four identical TRF actuators are connected to the peripheries of a micromirror plate through the  actuators' middle beams and connection springs as shown in Fig. 4.1. It is noted that the Poly0  layer is not shown in Fig. 4.1. The 4 actuators of the micromirror can be divided into 2 groups, as  shown in Fig. 4.1. A coordinate system with the origin located at the center of the micromirror  plate can be built. 4 actuators are names as  A1,  A2,  A3 and  A4. Actuators  A1 and  A3 are one group  65   

    which drives the micromirror plate to rotate with respect to y-axis. Actuator A2 and A4 are the other  group which drives the micromirror plate to rotate with respect to x-axis. Since both actuators in  the same group can only drive the micromirror plate on that side out of the plane, the rotation of  the micromirror plate is achieved by the out-of-plane displacement difference of the connection  point with the connection springs which is caused by the out-of-plane rotation of the actuators.  Due  to  the  fact  that  the  rotation  angle  of  each  actuator  can  be  controlled  independently  by  its  driving voltage, the rotation angle of the micromirror can also be controlled to continuously change  and is able to sustain at any achievable angle. This type of micromirror is also called quasistatic  micromirror. At last the combination of two axis rotation of the micromirror can steer the reflected  laser beam to scan through a 2D area shown in Fig. 4.3. There are several driving methods of the  micromirror, the one adopted in this thesis is shown in Eqs. (4.1) ~ (4.4)

Where V1, V2, V3 and V4 are the voltages applied to actuators 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. V0 is the  base voltage, e.g., 50 V. Vbias_a and Vbias_b are biased voltages ranging from -50 V ~ 50 V. Actuators  1 and 3 are in one group and subject to bias voltage of the same magnitude with opposite sign.  Actuators 2 and 4 are in one group and subject to bias voltage of the same magnitude with opposite  sign. The resultant different heights of the tips of the middle beams determine the orientation of  the micromirror. Fig. 4.1 shows a few examples of different orientations of the mirror plate realized  by varying the bias voltage. The dimensions of each of the four actuators such as the finger width,  lower/upper anchoring spring stiffness, connecting spring stiffness, etc. can be adjusted according  to the display system requirements such as the scanning area size, scanning speed, driving voltage  and resistance to vibration, etc. The dimensions of the micromirror are shown in Table 4.1. The  prototype of the micromirror is fabricated using PolyMUMPs as shown in Fig. 4.2 (a). Fig. 4.2 (b)  shows packaged micromirror.

graphics, i.e., vector display. Different from the raster scanning display the laser beam of which  scans through the whole display area line by line, the laser beam of the vector scanning display  only scans through the outline of the desired patterns.     A micromirror based display system is shown in Fig. 4.3. A laser diode is used as the light 

source and the laser beam shoots onto the mirror plate which reflects and steers the laser beam to  any desired direction with a high speed. The laser is modulated to be turned on and off with a  relative high frequency so that the laser is only turned on for the desired visible trajectories. After  reflected  by  the  micromirror,  a  double  side  concave  lens  is  used  to  1)  compensating  for  the  convergence of the laser bean reflected by the micromirror plate due to its curvature. The concave  lens  is  located  about  4.5  cm  from  the  micromirror  to  collimate  the  reflected  laser  beam;  2)  Amplifying the scanning angle of the micromirror by about 3 ~ 6 times. Thus by controlling the  four actuators to drive the mirror plate for quasistatic 2D rotation and modulating the laser, the  vector display can be realized. If a laser pattern is scanned periodically with a high refreshing rate,  e.g., 30 Hz, a steady laser pattern can be observed as shown in Fig. 4.3 (b).

the same time compensate for the curvature of the micromirror plate. It is desired that the lens can  be selected as the one that is available on the market so that there is no extra cost for customization.  The selection of the concave lens is presented in this section.      First, the model of the display system which is composed of collimated light source (laser), 

micromirror, a double side concave lens and a display screen is built in Zemax software shown in  Fig 4.4. Zemax is a ray tracing software that can be used for both imaging and illumination systems.

As shown in Fig. 4.4, a 1 mm diameter micromirror is positioned about 5 mm from the the 

light  source  and  has  about  45°  with  the  incident  light.  The  radius  of  the  curvature  of  the  micromirror  is  set  to  be  125  mm  which  is  measured  using  a  3D  optical  surafce  profiler  (zygo  NewView 6000). The radius of the curvature changes in the range 90 ~ 135 mm due to different  redidual strees gradiants in the fabrication process. One measured profile of the micromirror plate  is shown in Fig. 4.5.  

   Fig. 4.5 Profile measure of the micromirror plate.   

 

The micromirror is set to have a multiple tilt angles with respect to its center, i.e, 0°, 1.5 ° and 

-1.5 ° as shown in Fig.  4.6. There  are three variables of the  system, i.e., the distance  from the  double concave lens to the micromirror and the radius and thickness of the lens. The display scrren  is set to be 200 mm away from the double concave lens.  

70   

      A series of simulations have been performed using Zemax with the parameters of the concave 

lens changing for each one. The parameters of the double concave lens from Edmund optics which  is a large optical components provider in North America are used in the system. More specifically,  for each lens, the thickness and the radius are obtained from the Edmund optics website and entered  into the Zemax model. The local optimization solver is used to solve for the optimized distance  between  the  lens  and  the  micromirror.  The  wavefront  is  set  as  the  criteria  of  the  optimization  function which optimize the optical path difference (OPD). The optical system is set to be in the  afocal image space since the light does not focus to a plane, instead it is desired that the output  light is nearly collimated at the image plane. As a result, the optimization function tries to make  the light as collimated as possible when it reaches to the image plane.

  Fig. 4.6 Tilting of the micromiroror.    The  lens  used  for  simulation  is  shown  in  the  table  in  Appendix  C.  The  MgF2  coated  anti-

reflective (AR) double concave lenses are chosen to reduce the energy lose caused by the reflection.  The reflectance is smaller than 1.75% persurface for the wavelength from 400 ~ 700 nm. The AR  lens provided by Edmound Optics has diameter of 6 mm, 9 mm, 12 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm. Only  the ones with diameter 9 mm and 12 mm are selected as the potential lens and are used for the  Zemax optimization. Since it has been proved by Zemax simulation that most of 6 mm lens are  too small for the incident scanning laser beams reflected from the micromirror. Also 20 mm and  25 mm diameter are too large and is not suitable for system integration. There are two criteria of  choosing the lens. The first is the average divergence angles of the reflected laser beam of all the  tilt angles. The drivergence of the laser beam determines the spot size on the image plane which  71   

    futher determines the sharpness of the image. Smaller divergence angle of the laser beams after  the lens is desired. The second criterion is the scanning distance on the display screen when the  micromirror  rotation  from  -1.5  °  to  -1.5  °  along  a  single  axis.  A  lens  that  has  larger  scanning  distance is desired which can generate larger image on the display screen. The optimization results  are shown in the table in Appendix C. It can be seen that the lens with parameter 12 mm Dia × 12 mm FL filfills the two criteria and is more siutable for the display. Its amplification factor can  be estimated to be 5.7. However, since the actual micromirror curvature and and the distance of  the lens from the micromirror changes, this factor may vary in the range from 3 to 6.   4.3 Performance of the micromirror 4.3.1 Static performance   The mechanical rotation angle of the micromirror is measured using the setup on the optical 

breadboard shown in Fig. 4.7. A laser diode module with 532 nm wavelength is used to generate  a collimated laser beam whose output spot size is about 1.2 mm diameter. Since the micromirror  plate is 1 mm, a beam reducer is used to reduce the diameter of the laser beam to about 0.6 mm  while still maintains the beam collimated before it goes to the micromirror. The CQFP44 packaged  micromirror is positioned in a micromirror fixture. Four linear stages are used to adjust the position  of the micromirror plate so that the reflected laser is perpendicular with the optical breadboard. In  this case, the plane formed by the incident laser beam and the reflected laser beam is almost parallel  with  the  optical  breadboard.  In  this  case,  the  displacement  of  the  laser  beam  on  the  screen  is  proportional to the rotation angle of the micromirror plate.     To  obtain  the  mechanical  rotation  angle  of  the  micromirror  plate  subjected  to  a  certain 

combination of driving voltages (4 actuators), the corresponding displacement of the laser spot d  on the grid paper is recorded. The rotation angle of the micromirror  is then calculated using Eq.  (4.5) and illustrated in Fig. 4.8 (a).

of the micromirror is measured and the other axis shares the same rotation angle. Usually there are  three different driving methods of the micromirror. They are illustrated in Fig. 4.8 by driving the  micromirror to scan a horizontal line.

Fig. 4.9 Driving voltages for V1 and V3.    Different  driving  method  has  different  balance  position  of  the  micromirror.  The  balance 

position of the micromirror is the position that the micromirror plate rotate around in the operation.  When the micromirror is at the balance position, the corresponding reflected laser spot lies in the  center of the display area. The first driving method is illustrated in Fig. 4.8 (a) and the driving  voltages are defined by Eq. (4.1) ~ (4.4). Specific to the one axis scanning defined in Fig. 4.8 (a),  the base voltage (V0)  is applied to actuators 2 and 4 while square wave voltages with half period  phase difference (refer to Fig. 4.9) are applied to actuator 1 and 3. As a result, the balance position  of the micromirror plate has a certain distance from its underneath layer and is defined by the base  voltage.  A  higher  base  voltage  leads  to  higher  balance  position  of  the  micromirror  plate.  In  operation, the movement of the micromirror plate can be approximated to be rotating around its  center. The second driving method is shown in Fig. 4.8 (b). When the micromirror is scanning, a  high voltage Vhigh is applied to actuators 2 and 4 while square wave voltages with half period phase  difference are applied to actuator 1 and 3 as shown in Fig. 4.9. As a result, the balance position of  the  micromirror  plate  is  the  position  when  Vhigh  is  applied  to  all  the  actuators.  Different  from  method 1, during the rotation the center of the rotation varies. The third driving method is shown  in Fig. 4.8 (c). When the micromirror is scanning, zero voltage is applied to actuators 2 and 4 while  square wave voltages with half period phase difference are applied to actuator 1 and 3 as shown in  74   

    Fig. 4.8. As a result, the balance position of the micromirror plate is the position when no voltages  are applied to the actuators and is the closest to its underneath layer among all three driving method.  Similar  to  driving  method  2,  the  rotation  center  also  changes  during  the  rotation.  The  balance  position of the micromirror can significantly affect the dynamic performance of the micromirror.  If it is too close to the underlying layer, the squeezed film air damping will have great effect on  the  micromirror  plate  which  behaves  as  an  overdamped  system.  If  it  is  too  far  away  from  the  underlying  layer,  the  air  damping  is  greatly  reduced  and  the  micromirror  behaves  as  an  underdamped  system  with  large  overshoot.  Due  to  the  fact  that  the  balance  position  of  the  micromirror using first driving method can be controlled by the base voltage (V0), by using it the  balance position of the micromirror can be set to an optimized position so that the air damping is  neither too large to lead to a sluggish response of the micromirror nor too small to result in a large  overshoot.  As  a  result,  the  first  driving  method  is  selected  to  be  the  driving  method  for  the  micromirror and the driving voltages of 4 actuators follows the equation expressed in Eqs. (4.1) ~  (4.4).  Different base voltages are used to drive the micromirror to scan a horizontal line. As shown  in Table. 4.3, the base voltages (the voltage applied to V2 and V4) vary from 30 V to 80 V with 10  V increment are used to drive the micromirror. The peak to peak voltage of V1 and V3 matches the  corresponding base voltage to generate the maximum rotation angle.

paper only for the largest driving voltage shown in Table. 4.3, i.e., when V1 and V3 are applied 0 ~  160 V square wave voltages. The rotation angles of the micromirror applied with 160 V peak to  peak driving voltage, i.e.,  160V, can be calculated using Eq. (4.5) by known the displacement (d)  and the distance from the micromirror to the screen (Ds). Then the grid paper is replaced by a 2D  position sensing detector (PSD) which is an optical sensor and outputs the x and y coordinate of  the laser spot on its sensing area as two voltages. The output voltages of the sensor is proportional  75   

    to the location of the laser spot on its sensing area. The tests are then performed for each voltage  combination listed in Table. 4.3. The corresponding laser displacements and together with their  transient responses are captured by the PSD. The measured laser displacements of the tests 1 ~ 5  using PSD is converted to the corresponding rotation angles of the micromirror using Eq. (4.6).

(4.6) 

Where  i and  di are the rotation angle of the micromirror and the displacement of the laser spot  captured by the PSD when the peak to peak driving voltage is i V. 160 is the micromirror rotation  angle of test number 6 in Table 4.3 which was previously obtained. d160 is the displacement of the  laser spot captured by the PSD for test number 6. The ratio between the rotation angles of tests 1~  5 and 160 is proportional to the ratio of their laser displacement. Hence the micromirror rotation  angles of tests 1 ~ 5 can be calculated using Eq. (4.6). The reason not to measure all the rotation  angles  manually  by  marking  their  displacements  on  the  display  screen  is  to  reduce  the  measurement error. More specifically, when the driving voltages are small, the corresponding laser  spot  displacement  on  the  screen  is  very  small  i.e.,  in  a  few  millimeters.  As  a  result,  the  error  introduced by manually marking is usually large when the displacement is small. The error caused  by manually marking is analyzed in Fig. 4.10 where the large grey circles represents the spot of  the reflected laser beam on the display screen. It is desired that the marked points coincide with  the center of the laser spot, which introduces no marking error. However, this will not happen in  reality. On the other hand, the marked point is usually an arbitrary point within the diameter of the  laser spot, shown as the green circle in Fig. 4.10. The maximum possible error happens when the  marked points are on the edges of both laser spots, shown as the red squares in Fig. 4.10. As a  result, if the distance between the two marked points is relatively small, i.e., in a few millimeters,  a significant error might be introduced. For large driving voltages such as the ones in test 6 in  Table. 4.3, the displacement of the laser spot on the screen is relatively large, i.e., more than 18  mm. The laser spot diameter on the display screen is approximately 2 mm. In this case, the possible  maximum percentage of error introduced is about 11 %. It is noted that the 11% error only happens  when  the  marking  lies  on  the  edges  of  the  both  spots.  Usually  it  is  guaranteed  in  the  marking  process that the marked points always lie within the laser spot. As a result the introduced error is  far less than 11% and can be neglected. The error introduced by marking will increase with the 

76   

    degrees  of  the  laser  beam  displacement.  By  combining  the  manually  marking  and  PSD  measurement method presented above, the introduced error can be minimized.

  Fig. 4.10 Error introduced by manually marking.    The measured and calculated rotation angles for the tests listed in Table. 4.3 are shown in Fig. 

4.11. The rotation angle here is the sum of the positive rotation angle and the absolute value of the  negative rotation angle and is equal to twice of   as shown in Fig. 4.8. From Fig. 4.11 it can be  concluded  that  the  scanning  angle  increases  with  the  increase  of  the  applied  base  voltage.  The  increasing rate decreases with the increase of the base voltage. Namely, when the driving voltage  is relative high (near 200 V) further increase of the voltage will not lead to significant increase of  the rotation angle. On the other hand, high voltage may cause the breakdown of the insolation layer  of the device. In our experiment, 50 V is selected as the base voltage to drive the micromirror  which will lead to desired dynamic performance. The detailed reasons will be discussed in the  dynamic test of the micromirror in section 4.3.2.     Then the rotation angle variations with respect to the changes of the bias voltages are studied 

in detail when the base voltage is 50 V, as shown in Fig. 4.12. In Fig. 4.12, positive rotation angles  represents rotations towards north, east, northeast or northwest (refer to Fig. 4.2). Negative values  represent  rotations  towards  south,  west,  southeast  and  southwest.  Horizontal  axis  shows  the  magnitudes of biased voltages Vbias_a or Vbias_b. The applied biased voltages are the same as shown  in Fig. 4.1 (b) ~ (h). In order to obtain the pure mechanical rotation angle, double side concave  lens is not added for the measurement. From the testing results, the maximum mechanical rotation 

77   

    angle along north-south and east-west is about 1.1 ° and the angle along northeast-southeast and  northeast-southwest direction is about 1.5 ° when the bias voltage is 50 V.

    The  transient  response  of  the  laser  spot  movement  reflect  the  transient  response  of  the 

micromirror and can be acquired by the PSD. 3 characteristics are used to evaluate the transient  step response of the micromirrors which are rise time (Tr), settling time (Ts) and percentage of the  overshoot (Os). Rise time is the time for the response signal to travel from 10% to 90% of the final  steady state. Settling time is the time for the response signal to be stabilized within ±2% bandwidth  of the final state value. Percentage of overshoot is defined as the ratio of the difference between  the peak value of the response signal and the steady state value with the difference between the  steady state value with the initial state value.

      The  transient  step  response  of  the  micromirror  under  different  base  voltages  are  tested.  To 

make it easier to observe the performance, the micromirror plate is only controlled to perform a  1D scanning. The driving methods presented in Eq. (4.1) ~ (4.4) are used to generate the driving  voltages. For each test, first all the actuators are applied the base voltage and zero bias voltage is  applied to all the actuators for a while which will stabilize the micromirror plate to its balance  position. Then a non-zero bias voltage is applied to only one group of actuators, i.e., actuator 1  and 3, while the voltages of actuator 2 and 4 stay unchanged. As a result, the micromirror plate  will rotate with respect to y-axis (shown in Fig. 4.1 (a)) from the balance position to a certain angle  which is determined by the magnitude of the applied bias voltage. The voltage combinations used  for tests are summarized in Table 4.4 and the performances are measured and analyzed.     The measured results of Tr, Ts and Os are shown in Figs. 4.12 ~ 4.14. Fig. 4.12 shows the rise 

time variations of different base voltages with the changes of applied bias voltages. It verifies that  lower base voltage leads to a sluggish response since the micromirror plate is close to its underlying  layer and the air damping provides a significant resistance to the movement. With the increase of  the base voltage, the balance position of the micromirror plate is farther away from the underlying  layer and as a result, the response speed of the micromirror can be significantly improved. Also it  can be concluded that for the same base voltage, the rise time reduces with the increase of the bias  voltage. This is due to the fact that higher bias voltage will generate higher rotation torques which  will lead to higher response speed. This effect is only significant when the base voltage is low such  as 50 V and 60 V. When the base voltage is high (> 60 V), the improvement of the rise time by  increasing the bias voltage is  not much.  However  the fast  response speed of high base voltage  comes with a drawback of large percentage of overshoot as shown in Fig 4.14. This is attributed  to the significantly weakened air damping. It can be seen that the percentage of the overshoot is  about 40% ~ 50% when the base voltage is 80 V, which is due to the reduced air damping. The  percentage of overshoot reduces to nearly zero when the base voltage is reduced to 50 V. As a  result, even the response speed can be improved by increasing the base voltage, the accompanying  large overshoot will cause vibration of the system, which washes away the benefit of fast response  speed and leads to long settling time. The settling time of the tests shown in Table 4.4 is plotted in  Fig. 4.15. It can be seen that the settling time of the response under base voltages 60 V~ 80V have  a significant increase with the increase of the bias voltage, which is attributed to the vibration of  the system which is caused by large overshoot and matches the overshoot plot shown in Fig. 4.14.  80   

    Also it can be seen that the settling time of 50 V base voltage tests maintain a relative small value  over  the  entire  available  bias  voltage  ranges  which  is  mainly  due  to  the  consistency  of  its  percentage of overshoot. It can be concluded that by using 50 V base voltage the micromirror has  a consistent and relatively small settling time over the entire bias voltage range without overshoot.  It comes with a cost of slow response speed (relative long rise time).

Fig. 4.15 Settling time of the micromirror under different base voltages.    For vector display application it is desired that the micromirror can achieve a large maximum 

rotation angle (1° scanning angle, ± 0.5 °) to have a large display area and meanwhile the transient  response of the micromirror has small settling time and overshoot (less than 5%) and fast response  speed to improve the refreshing rate and then reduce the display distortion. Since 50 V base voltage  leads to almost no overshoot and considering its consistent dynamic performance, it is the most  suitable  base  voltage  to  drive  the  micromirror.  The  only  defect  of  slow  response  speed  can  be  improved using control approach which will be presented in Chapter 5.     The frequency response of the micromirror is also measured. The experiment setup is similar 

to Fig. 4.7 except that a PSD is used to acquire the movement of the reflected laser beam. The  frequency  response  of  the  micromirror  driven  under  two  base  voltages,  i.e.,  50V  and  70V,  are  measured  separately  for  different  bias  voltages.  The  voltages  applied  to  the  micromirror  is  summarized in Table. 4.5 which are generated using Eq. (4.1) ~ (4.4). For all the tests, the bias  voltage  Vbias_b for actuator  A2 and  A4 is zero therefore the DC base voltage is directly applied to  them  during  the  tests.  While  depends  on  different  Vbias_a voltages,  the  sinusoidal  voltages  with  different amplitudes are applied to actuator A2 and A4 in each test.

phase angle differences are applied to actuators  A1 and  A3. The corresponding responses of the  reflected laser beam are acquired by the PSD. Bode plot is created using the recorded data and are  shown in Figs. 4.16 ~ 4.18. Some characteristic of the micromirror dynamic performance can be  concluded as below.   (1)  From the  amplitude  responses, it  can be  concluded that  in low base  voltage  operation, i.e.,  smaller  or  equal  to  50  V,  the  micromirror  appears  to  be  an  overdamped  system.  In  high  base  voltage  operation,  i.e.,  larger  or  equal  to  70V  the  micromirror  appears  to  be  an  underdamped  system. This matches the conclusion made from the step response tests.   (2)  From  the  phase  responses,  it  can  be  observed  that  in  low  base  voltage  operation,  the  micromirror exhibit a larger lag in the frequency range 100 Hz ~ 1 KHz, than operating in high  base voltage. This matches the previous conclusion that the micromirror has a slow response speed  when the base voltage is low.

    4.3.3 Comparison of micromirrors   The static and dynamic performance of the micromirror presented in this chapter is compared 

with that of the previously developed micromirror based on ORF actuators. A generic approach is  used to control both the micromirrors to display same pattern which is also compared.   4.3.3.1 Static performance comparison   The same tests shown in Table. 4.3 is also performed on the previously developed micromirror 

based on ORF actuators and the testing results are also shown in Fig. 4.19 (a) together with the  static performance of the novel micromirror based on TRF actuator. It can be seen that for various  base voltages from 30 V to 80 V, the presented micromirror have much larger rotation angles than  the ORF micromirror. The angles here are the sum of the positive and absolute value of negative  rotation angles. The percentage of the improvement is calculated by dividing the rotation angle of  the ORF micromirror by the rotation angle difference between the two micromirrors under the  same driving voltage. The improvement in percentage is shown in Fig. 4.19 (b) from which it can  be concluded that improvement is at least 120% for various base voltage.

make the comparison, the response speed denoted as v is defined as:   

v


Tr

  

(4.7) 

Where  is the rotation angle of the micromirror in the step response and Tr is the rise time of the  step response which is defined as the time from 10% to 90% of the total rotation (movement).    The responses of the tests listed in Table. 4.3 are used for comparison and are performed on 

both micromirrors. The dynamic responses are measured and recorded using PSD. According to  Eq. (4.7), two variables  and Tr are required to obtain v.  for both the micromirrors has already  been obtained from the above section as shown in Fig. 4.19. The rise time (Tr) can be measured  from the recorded dynamic response and are shown in Fig. 4.20. It can be seen that under the same  applied voltage (base and bias voltages), the rise time of the TRF micromirror is lower than that  of the ORF micromirror. Considering that  the TRF micromirror rotates  more than twice of the  ORF  micromirror  while  has  similar  rise  times  with  that  of  the  ORF  micromirror,  it  can  be  88   

    concluded that the TRF micromirror has a faster response speed. A quantitative comparison of the  response speed is shown in Fig. 4.21 by using Eq. (4.7).

that the response speed of the TRF micromirror is faster than the ORF micromirror under all the  base voltage. The improvement is  about 135% ~ 176%. The maximum and minimum improve  happen at the base voltage of 50 V and 60 V.   4.3.3.3 Display result comparison using generic display approach   The micromirrors presented in this chapter and previously are used to display a same vector 

pattern  which  can  be  potentially  used  for  automotive  HUD.  The  pattern  is  generated  using  the  generic method presented in [123]. Two display systems are set up on the optical breadboard for  two micromirrors separately. The setup of the testing system is similar to the one shown in Fig.  4.7 except that a double side concave lens is added on the reflected laser path to obtain a clear and  large  display.  Two  identical  double  concave  lenses  are  used  in  two  display  systems  and  the  distances of the lenses to the micromirrors are adjusted separately to obtain sharp displays on the  screens. Due to different curvatures of the two micromirror plates, the distances of the lenses to  the  micromirrors  from  which  a  sharp  display  can  be  obtained  are  different.  As  a  result,  the  90   

    magnification factors of the double side concave lenses are different for two display systems. It is  measured that the magnification factors are 3.2 and 4.2 for the display system based on the previous  and  TRF  micromirrors  respectively.  In  order  to  eliminate  the  effect  of  different  magnification  factor of the lens and only compare the scanning range of the micromirrors, the screen is adjusted  in the display system of the ORF micromirror so that the distance of the screen to the micromirror  is 1.3 (4.2/3.2) times farther than that of the display system of the TRF micromirror. Hence the  difference of the magnification factor of two display systems are compensated, and the display  sizes of the two display systems can be compared directly.

Fig. 4.22 An example of the calibrated points (V0 = 50 V).    The calibration, which relates the positions of a finite numbers of laser spots on the display 

screen with their corresponding driving voltages, is performed for both display systems separately.  The driving method expressed in Eqs. (4.1) ~ (4.4) are used to generate the calibration voltages.  The display system is calibrated by varying the biased voltages, Vbias_a and Vbias_b linearly in their  ranges and recording the laser spot locations on the screen. One example of the calibration is shown  in Fig. 4.22. For example, the red circled point corresponds to the bias voltages of Vbias_a = Vbias_b  = 50 V with V0 = 50 V. For any point on the screen, e.g., the triangle shape point, the corresponding  91   

    bias voltages can be obtained by linearly interpolating the biased voltages of the surrounding four  calibrated points. Other than 50 V base voltage, base voltages such as 60 V, 70 V, 80 V are also  used to conduct calibration experiments, and the corresponding calibration matrices similar to the  one shown in Fig. 4.22 are generated. The higher the based voltage that is used for calibration, the  larger the calibration area is.

The display patterns are designed inside the chosen calibration area, e.g., the one shown in Fig. 

4.22. The calibration based on 80 V base voltage is used to generate the control voltages for the  ORF micromirror in order to achieve a relative large display area. The display result is shown in  Fig. 4.23 (a) and the maximum voltage applied is about 140 V. In order to obtain a display without  severe distortion, the calibration with a relative small base voltage i.e., 60 V, is selected to generate  92   

    the control voltage for the TRF micromirror. By varying the applied voltage, the size of the display  of the TRF micromirror changes from small to large as shown in Fig. 4.23 (b) ~ (f). The maximum  voltage applied to the micromirror is about 110 V when displaying the pattern in (f). A ruler is  used as a reference to compare the size of displays. It can be seen that even with lower driving  voltage,  the  TRF  micromirror  still  can  generate  much  larger  displays.  The  display  distortion  increases with the increase of the size of the display. It can be observed from Fig. 4.23 that when  the display pattern of the TRF micromirror is about 2.8 times of that of the ORF micromirror, the  display quality is still similar. The enlarged views of Fig. 4.23 (a) and (d) are shown in Fig. 4.24. 

     (a)                                                               (b) 

 

Fig. 4.24 Enlarged views of the displays in Fig. 4.23 (a) Enlarged view of Fig. 4.23 (a). (b)  Enlarged view of Fig. 4.23 (d).    The maximum driving voltage for the TRF micromirror to display the pattern in Fig. 4.23 (d) 

is 80 V.  The maximum driving voltage for the ORF micromirror to display the pattern in Fig. 4.23  (a)  is  140  V.  It  has  been  found  in  [107]  that  the  maximum  applicable  voltage  for  the  ORF  micromirror is about 200 V which can also considered as the upper boundary of the applicable  voltage  for  the  TRF  micromirror  due  to  the  same  fabrication  process.  In  this  case,  the  TRF  micromirror owing to lower controlling voltage has much larger control capability. Namely, much  larger voltage can be applied to the TRF micromirror before it hit the maximum applicable voltage,  i.e., there is 120 V difference from 80 V to 200 V compared to that of the ORF micromirror which  has only 60 V difference from 140 V to 200 V.  As a result, the TRF micromirror will have larger  voltage range within the safe voltage limit to adjust and increase the response time, which can  potentially  lead  to  better  display  quality.  This  has  been  proved  in  the  next  chapter  that  when  advance  display  approach  is  used,  the  TRF  micromirror  can  achieve  better  display  quality  and  93   

    larger display size than that of the ORF micromirror. The same display of Fig. 4.24 with higher  refreshing frequency (40 Hz) is shown in Fig. 4.25. It can be seen that the display result of the TRF  micromirror suffers from less distortion than that of the ORF micromirror. This is attributed to the  fact that the TRF micromirror has a faster response speed.

display results are shown in Fig. 4.26. Smaller driving voltages are applied to the TRF micromirror  to  generate  a  larger  pattern  than  that  of  the  ORF  micromirror.  The  display  quality  of  the  TRF  micromirror is slightly improved compared to that of the ORF one.

larger vector graphics with smaller driving voltage. The TRF micromirror is able to generate vector  94   

    patterns with less distortion than that of the ORF micromirror due to faster response speed. More  important, the lower driving voltage of the TRF micromirror provides it with much larger control  capability than the ORF micromirror. This enables the display result of the TRF micromirror to be  greatly  improved  by  developing  proper  control  algorithm.  As  a  result,  an  advanced  display  approach  will  be  presented  in  the  next  chapter  which  can  significantly  improve  the  display  capability of the TRF micromirror.

Chapter 5 Advanced display approach for micromirror based vector display
This chapter is based on the following paper that is to be submitted:  Chao  Fan  and  Siyuan  He,  "Micromirror  based  automotive  head  up  display  (HUD)",  IEEE Transaction on Mechatronics.       In this chapter, an advanced display approach for micromirror based vector display is presented.  This approach consists of the following steps: 1) Display system calibration; 2) Scanning trajectory  design; 3) Determination of point number for each segment; 4) Allocate display points for each  segment;  5)  Assign  voltages  to  points.  All  above  steps  are  presented  in  this  chapter.  The  comparison between the advanced display approach and the previously developed generic display  approach is also presented. 5.1 Criteria of display quality   The display quality is important for a HUD system, the quality of the image is defined by 4 

criteria, i.e., 1) refreshing rate, 2) distortion and 3) brightness of the display 4) the uniformity of  the  illuminance.  Refreshing  rate  is  the  number  of  times  that  the  laser  beam  scans  through  a  designed trajectory in one second in the unit of Hz. Due to the persistence of vision theory, in order  for a person to perceive a stable display, a large refreshing rate is always desired for a display  system, i.e., equal or greater than 30 Hz. Distortion is the observable deviation of the scanning  laser path from the desired trajectory. Brightness of the image is another important criterion for  the display system which indicates how much luminous power of the displayed patterns can be  observed in a certain angle, it has the unit of cd/m. The uniformity of the illuminance indicate how  uniform the light is illuminated from the display.     The degree of distortion is positive correlated with the refreshing rate. Namely, a larger frame 

frequency will lead to a more severe distorted display. Also it is related to the dynamic response  of the micromirror. Some display distortions are illustrated in Fig. 5.1. It is assumed that the laser  trajectory is composed with two line segments which has 90 ° between each other. The scanning  laser  beam  is  controlled  to  follow  3  vertexes,  A,  B  and  C  which  are  labeled  in  Fig.  5.1.  The  96   

    distortion shown in Fig. 5.1 (a) is caused due to the fact that the command to drive the laser beam  to move to C is sent out before it reaches point B. As a result, the right angle vertex is distorted  into a curve. This kind of distortion can be improved by accelerating the response speed of the  micromirror. Another distortion is shown in Fig. 5.1 (b) which is less common than the first type  of the distortion. This distortion is caused only by the overshoot of the system, the laser beam goes  beyond the point B first and then stabilized at B after which it proceeds to point C. This situation  happens when the system has the overshoot and enough time is given to the scanning. As a result,  the laser beam will first be stabilized at B before it proceeds to C. However, in most cases in order  to achieve a desired refreshing rate, the time provided for the scanning is not enough for it to be  fully settled down before the BC driving command is given. Instead, the distortion in Fig. 5.1 (c)  is most likely to happen in the display. It is caused by both overshoot and the slow response speed.  In this case, a much more severe distortion is generated compared to that in (a) and (b).

as large overshoot and slow response speed need to be overcome. Open loop and close loop control  are the two control schemes that are usually used for the micro-device control. Each scheme has  its own advantages and disadvantages [144]. Open loop control uses the pre-designed signal to  drive the micromirror directly which does not require a high computational controller. So the open  loop  controlled  system  has  much  less  calculation  burden,  and  can  be  implemented  by  simple  microprocessor, which will lead to low cost and compact devices. Also, the close loop control of  the  presented  display  system  requires  sensing  mechanism.  The  high  speed  scanning  requires  optical sensors, i.e., position sensing detector (PSD) with high speed. The PSD with high sampling  97   

    rate (>1MHz) and relative large sensing area lead to a system with much higher cost than open  loop controlled system. As a result, an open loop control mechanism is developed to control the  micromirror in this section.     An effective open loop control approach of the micromirror to track a trajectory is to drive the 

micromirror to have a point to point motion through a number of properly distributed points on the  trajectory. Due to the dynamic performance of the micromirror such as large overshoot and slow  response speed, the displayed pattern will be distorted. The undesired distortion can be reduced or  even eliminated by properly designing the distribution of the points.     The proposed advanced display approach of generating the control points is composed of 5 

steps. The 1st step is to calibrate the display system to obtain the relationship between the driving  voltages  of  the  micromirror  with  the  locations  of  the  corresponding  laser  spots  on  the  display  screen. The 2st step is to design the scanning trajectory inside the calibration area. The trajectory  is designed to be only composed of line segment, and the end points (critical points) for all the  segments are obtained. The 3rd step is to assign the number of control points to each line segment.  The 4th step is to design the distribution of the control points on the line segments. The last step is  to optimize the design parameters to obtain good display quality using trial and error method. The  detailed approach are discussed as follows.   5.2 Display system calibration   Calibration of the display system is a characterization procedure which relates the positions of 

a series of points on the  display screen with their corresponding driving  voltages.  The relation  between the driving voltages and the locations of the corresponding dots on the display includes  both  the  electromechanical  coupling  and  optical  refraction.  Electromechanical  coupling  is  the  relationship between the applied voltages and the corresponding rotation angles of the micromirror.  The optical coupling refers to the effect of the double side concave lens on the scanning angles  (amplification  and  distortion).  The  calibration  is  an  easy  way  to  accurately  capture  all  these  complicated relations.     Position Sensing Detector (PSD) is usually used to detect the laser spot position. The output 

of a PSD provides us with the coordinates of the centroid of the incident light spot. A PSD based  calibration approach has been presented in [109], [123]. However, due to the rough surface of the  surface machined micromirror plate and the protective glass of the micromirror, the reflected laser  98   

    spot is usually noisy and the PSD is likely to fail to provide the accurate position of the laser spots.   Ideally because the incident laser beam is a circle in shape, the reflected spot on the sensor should  also be approximately a circle; however, the actual reflected laser beam is usually a complicated  patterns shown in Fig. 5.2. In Fig. 5.2 the reflected laser beam has one big center circle and some  small  laser  dots  around.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  micromirror  is  fabricated  by  surface  micromachining process which leads to releasing holes and dimples on its surface. This will cause  a poor surface quality. The small  features on the  micromirror plate  are reflected to the display  together with the desired laser spot. Some of the  noisy dots moves with the micromirror while  some does not and the intensity of noisy dots changes with the movement of the micromirror. Also,  there is always a protective anti-glare glass covering the micromirror. Even the glass is anti-glare  there is still a visible dot reflected to the screen which does not move as the micromirror moves.  Since PSD  provides the  coordinate of the  laser spot by  calculating the  centroid of  all  the light  illuminating on it, the time changing intensity of the illuminance caused by the noisy light will  have a significant effect on the accuracy of the PSD. As a result, it is not the best choice for the  calibration of the micromirror based scanning display system. In order to improve the accuracy of  the calibration, a camera based calibration method is developed in this section which uses a camera  to  capture  the  calibrated  points  on  the  display  screen.  The  noisy  light  can  be  eliminated  using  image processing methods and a more accurate result can be obtained.     In order to perform calibration, a set of control voltage combinations are generated using Eqs. 

(4.1) ~ (4.4) by linearly changing the two bias voltages. The generated voltage combinations are  then applied to the micromirror one combination by one combination. The positions of each laser  spot on the 2D display plane together with their driving voltages are captured by the camera. The  system setup of the calibration is shown in Fig. 5.2 and the reflected laser beam scans a spot matrix  which is shown in Fig. 5.3.    A DSLR camera due to its high image resolution, variable focal length and long exposure time 

is used to capture the reflected laser spots in one shot for all the voltage combinations applied to  the micromirror. The camera is positioned in front of the display screen and the focal length of the  camera lens is adjusted so that the camera is focused on the laser spots, and the laser spot matrix  lies  in  the  center  of  the  view.  The  predefined  driving  voltage  combinations  are  applied  to  the  micromirror in a certain sequence and there is a hold time between each combination of the driving  voltage, which gives enough time for the micromirror plate to be fully stabilized and stays in the  99   

    steady position for a short time period. The laser is modulated to be only turned on during the  period that the micromirror is stabilized for each driving voltage set.

Cannon EOS Rebel T3i with 18 ­ 200 mm focal lens is used for the calibration. The exposure 

time is set to be its maximum which is 30 s so that as many points can be calibrated. The number  of the driving voltage combinations needs to be carefully decided. If the number is too large, it  will lead to a dense laser spot matrix from which the adjacent spots are hard to be distinguished  100   

    by image processing. While a too small number will have few calibration spots which will lead to  a low resolution calibration model. In practice, the number is decided by trial and error method  and a total number of 441 driving voltage sets are used to generate a 21 × 21 laser spot matrix. The  hold time between voltage sets is set be 65 ms and the on time for the laser is set to be 15 ms which  leaves 50 ms for the micromirror to reach steady state. Due to the long exposure time, in order to  get a properly exposed image, the light illumination of the background needs to be controlled at a  low level. The recorded image is shown in Fig. 5.3.     Image  processing  method  is  used  to  extract  the  coordinate  of  each  laser  spot  in  the  image 

coordinate system that is shown in Fig. 5.3. Image processing and analysis software ImageJ is used  to process the image. It can be observed from Fig. 5.3 that due to the roughness of the micromirror  plate a lot of green light noise has been introduced and enhanced by long exposure time. An RGB  image can be split into 3 independent images each one contain only one color component and the  brightness of each pixel is measured by the grey scale ranging from 0 to 255. By observation, the  red channel image has the least green light noise while the spot matrix still keeps a good contrast  with the background as shown in Fig. 5.4. It can also be observed that there are some spots still  connected which will be hard to be separated simply by using the image processing. In this case,  free hand modification is needed to manually separate a few connected points as shown in Fig. 5.5.  After the  modification, the threshold of the image is  adjusted and converted into binary image  (black and white) as shown in Fig. 5.6. Then the "fillhole", "close", "open", and noise canceling  operation are performed on the image to make all the spot area disconnected with a relative smooth  edge. The final image after processing is shown in Fig. 5.7.

analysis function of the ImageJ. A look-up table can be built by mapping the coordinates of all of  the  calibrated  points  to  their  corresponding  driving  voltages.  The  driving  voltages  of  any  noncalibrated  point  with  known  image  coordinates  can  be  obtained  by  interpolating  the  driving  voltages of the surrounding 4 points.

designed inside the calibration area. One example is shown in Fig. 5.8.

  (b)  Fig. 5.9 (a) Desired vector pattern (b) Visible and transitional paths of the desired vector pattern.    A  designed  trajectory  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.9  (a).  It  is  composed  of  visible  and  transitional 

paths.The scanning directions are also marked in the figure. Visible paths are the trajectories of  the desired pattern and transitional paths are the trajectories (usually lines) that are used to connect  the discrete desired patterns, which are shown as solid red and blue segments in Fig. 5.9. Both  visible and transitional paths are composed of lines and curves. The curves are imitated by multiple  very short line segments such as letter "C" in Fig. 5.9. Lines refers to relative long line segment  such as digit "1" and lectter "V". The laser is turned on for the visible paths and turned off for the  104   

    transitional paths, as a result, only the desired patterns will be observed in the display. Among all  the segments, one segment is defined as the start segment whand its previous segment is defined  as the end segment. All the segments are directional and are sequenced from the start segment to  the end segment. The directions of the segments determine the scanning direction of the laser beam.  There are two endpoints in one segment, by following the direction of the segment, the endpoint  that starts the segment is defined as the start point and the the one that ends the segment is defined  as the end point. The endpoints of all the segments are the critical points which define the main  shape of the pattern and are shown as circles in Fig. 5.9 (b).    The micromirror steers the laser beam to scan through the trajectory by following a series of 

points such as the critical points. However, the critical points due to their small amount of numbers  and coarse distributions have very poor control capbility of the the micromirror to compensate the  undesired dynamics when tracing the desired trajectories. With only the critical points being the  control points, the display will suffer from large distortions caused by the dynamic response of the  micromiror, i.e., large overshoot and slow response speed. As a result, it is necessary to insert more  control points besides the critical points to compensate the undesired dynamics of the micromirror.  The critical points and the inserted points together consist of the control points of the micromirror.  The number of points that inserted for each line segment and their distribution need to be carefully  decided so that the dynamic response of the micromirror will not casue significant distortion of  the display. The approach to determine the number of points inserted for each segment and their  distributions is discussed in the following section.   5.4 Point allocation 5.4.1 Point number assignment   After the trajectory is designed and the critical points are extracted, the total number of the 

segments is known. The total number of control points N is provided as an empirical value. Then  different point number allocation strategies are used to assign a certain number of points to the  visible line segments, visible curve segment and transitional segment.     As  discussed  in  section  5.1,  the  overshoot  and  the  slow  response  speed  of  the  micromirror 

dynamic performance are the main cause for the display distortion. It was discovered in chapter 4  that the overshoot of the presented micromirror can be almost eliminated by applying a relative  low base voltage, i.e., 50 V. However, it comes with the cost of a sluggish response speed of the  105   

    micromirror due to the effect of squeezed film damping. Different segments due to their lengths  and point distribution strategies require different amount of time for the laser beam to scan through.  Usually when driving the micromirror for display, once the refreshing rate is determined, the time  interval between sending out the corresponding driving voltages of the points is a constant. As a  result, the number of points assigned to each segment also represents the amount of time assigned  to each segment. The aim of point number assignment is to assign proper number of points to each  segment  so  that  there  will  be  enough  time  for  the  micromirror  to  steer  the  laser  beam  to  scan  through  the  entire  segment.  The  main  factor  that  affects  the  required  scanning  time  for  each  segment is the length of the segment. Usually the longer segments require more time than that of  the shorter segments since larger displacements of the micromirror are required to scan the longer  segments.  However,  if  the  length  of  the  segment  is  too  short,  more  time  (or  control  points)  is  required since the average scanning speed is slower on the short segment than that on the longer  segment. This is due to the fact that the electrostatic actuation torque provided by the actuator is  proportional to the square of the driving voltage. The short segment has smaller voltage variation  from its start point to the end point than that of the long segment, which hence result in smaller  average actuation torque and then smaller average scanning speed.    As mentioned early the segments can be divided into visible segment and transitional segment. 

For the visible segment, in terms of whether the segment belongs to a straight line or a curve it can  be  categorized  as  line  segment  and  curve  segment.  The  three  different  types  of  segments  (transitional segment, visible line segment and visible curve segment) are treated differently when  assigning point number and distributing the points which will be discussed in the next section. For  convenience, the visible line segment and visible curve segment are called line segment and curve  segment hereafter.    The  curve  segments  are  used  to  imitate  the  curve  which  have  very  short  lengths.  A  large 

number of curve segments are usually clustered together such as digit "5" and letter "C" shown in  Fig. 5.9. When extracting the critical points which define the shape of the pattern a lot of control  points have already been assigned to the curve and no extra points are needed. The number of point  that assigned to the curves is denoted as  Nc. The point number assigned to transitional segments  and visible line segments needs to subtract Nc from the total number of points (N), i.e., N-Nc.  

106   

      In order to assign the number of points to transitional segments and visible line segments, the 

weight factor is introduced and a weight factor is assigned to each segment. The number of points  assign to each segment is  proportional  to its weight factor. The weight factor assigned to  each  segment depends on both the length level and the length of the segment. Three length levels which  are short, middle and long are defined to classify the segments. The ratio between the length of a  segment, i.e.,  l, and the length of the longest visible line segment, i.e.,  lVisMax is used to measure  the  length  level.  For  visible  line  segments  the  largest  ratio  of  l/ lVisMax is  1  and  for  transitional  segments the largest ratio may be larger or smaller than 1 since the longest transitional segment  may be shorter or longer than the longest  visible line segment. Some thresholds are defined to  classify  the  segments  into  different  length  levels.  The  length  level  classification  of  visible  line  segments is illustrated in Fig. 5.10.

(b)  Fig. 5.10 (a) Length level classification of the line segments (b) Length level classification of the  transitional segments.    Three thresholds  T0,  T1 and  T2 are used to define different levels of the segment length. The 

threshold  T0 is used to distinguish the curve segment from the line segment since they are much  shorter than the visible line segments. The ratio l/ lVisMax of the curve segment lies between 0 and  T0. Since the length of the curve segment is small,  T0 is usually equal or smaller than 0.15. It is  usually a constant for a pattern once the critical points are defined for the pattern, as shown in Fig.  5.9. If the ratio is larger than T0 and smaller than T1, the segment is defined as short and if the ratio  is larger than T2 the segment is defined as long. The segment whose ratio of l/ lVisMax lies between 

107   

    T1  and  T2  are  defined  as  middle  length.  The  similar  classification  can  be  made  for  transitional  segments as shown in Fig. 5.10 (b) with thresholds T1' and T2'.     The weight factor assigned to each segment is proportional to the ratio of l/ lVisMax and depends 

on  its  visibility  (transitional  segment  or  visible  line  segment)  and  length  level.  Two  piecewise  linear functions expressed in Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) are designed to assign the number of points to  the visible line segments and transitional segments respectively. There are 3 subdomains of each  piecewise function which corresponds to 3 length levels, i.e., short, middle and long, as illustrated  in Fig. 5.10. In Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2),  WVis(i) is the weight factor of the  ith segment if it is a line  segment.  WTran(i) is the weight factors of the ith segment if it is a transitional segment. l(i) is the  length of the ith segment. lVisMax is the length of the longest visible segment. T1, T2, T1' and T2' are  the thresholds which determines the length levels. Ks, Km, Kl and Ks', Km', Kl' are the parameters of  two weight factor functions.

(5.2) 

 

In Eq. (5.1), Ks, Km, Kl are the slopes of the linear functions of three subdomains. Usually for 

the middle length level,  Km is equal to 1 which indicates that the weight factor of the visible line  segment that lies in the middle length level is simply the ratio of l/lVisMax. As mentioned early, the  short segment gets more weight than it deserves according to its length, i.e., more than  l/lVisMax,  and the long segment get less weight than it should have got in terms of its length, i.e., less than  l/lVisMax. The actual weight factors for the visible line segments of each subdomains are controlled  by Ks, Km and Kl and they follow the relation that Ks > Km > Kl. Similar to the visible line segment,  108   

    in Eq. (5.2),  Ks' and  Km' are the slopes of two linear functions with  Ks' >  Km'.   Kl' is  usually  a  constant which indicates that if the length of a transitional segment is long, the weight assigned to  it does not increase with its length and remains a constant. This will reduce the weight of long  transitional segments and enable more control points assigned to the short and middle segment.  The reason is that the points on the transitional segment can have a nonlinear distribution due to  its invisibility. The nonlinear distribution of the control points allow the laser beam to scan through  the segment and stabilize at the end point with less control points (time) compared to that of the  line segments whose control points is desired to be linearly distributed along the segment. The  long transitional segment due to large ratio of l/lVisMax will have more than enough points assigned  to it. As a result, a constant weight function in the long segment length subdomain will help to  prevent from assigning redundant points to it. One example of the weight factor function for visible  line segment is shown in Fig. 5.11. Where T0, T1, T2 are 0.15, 0.25 and 0.5 respectively. Ks, Km, Kl are 1.4, 1 and 0.6 accordingly.

    Where W(i) and P(i) are the weight factor and the proportion of the weight factor of ith segment.  It  is  noted  that  due  to  the  very  small  length,  the  curve  segment  has  a  fixed  number  of  points  assigned, i.e., 1, as a result their weight factor are equal to zero. Then the exact number of points  assigned to each segment is calculated in Eq. (5.4).

(5.4) 

Where  n(i) is the point number allocated for the  ith segment.  N and  Nc are the total number of  points and the point number allocated for curve segments. If the segment is curve segment, only  one  point  is  assigned  to  it  and  if  the  segment  is  transitional  or  line  segment  the  point  number  allocated is calculated by multiplying the proportion of its weight factor P(i) with the total number  of points excluding the point number for the curve segments, i.e., N - Nc. Since the point number  can only be integer, the result is rounded to the nearest integer.   5.4.2 Design point distribution   After each segment is  assigned with the proper number of points, their distributions on the 

segments need to be determined. The the distributions of the control points need to be designed in  a way that is able to compensate the slow response speed of the micromirror in scanning display.   5.4.2.1 Point distribution   The  point  distribution  on  the  visible  segments  play  a  more  important  role  than  that  on  the 

transitional  segments.  Since  the  transitional  segment  is  invisible  and  the  only  aim  of  the  point  distribution is to stablize the laser beam fast at its end point, a nonlinear distribution of the points  can be designed. On the other hand, the distortion casued by the visible segments can easily be  observed and the point distribution on them needs to be treated more carefully. From the display  criteria discussed at the beginning of the chapter, the illuminance of the scanned visible segments  should be uniform and at the same time the display should have a distortion as small as possible.  In order to guarantee the uniformity of the illuminance of the display, the generic display approach  previously  prsented  [123]  adopts  an  even  distribution  of  the  control  points  along  the  visible  segments. The even distribution works fine when the refreshing rate is relative low, i.e., about 30  Hz. However, a significant display distortion is  present with the increase  of the refreshing rate  (refreshing rate) as shown in Fig. 5.12 below.   110

The main reason is that the even distribution in generic display approach has no flexibility of 

speeding up the response of the micromirror. With a higher refreshing rate, the laser beam has to  scan through each segment with less time. A higher refreshing rate will lead to a significant lag  between  the  driving  signal  and  the  actual  location  of  the  laser  beam.  Consequently,  when  the  control signal for the next segment comes, the laser beam still has not reach or even far away from  the start point of the next segment, which will lead to the distortion of the display.     In  order  to  prevent  the  overshoot  from  causing  the  display  distortion,  a  relative  low  base 

voltage, i.e., 50 V, is used to drive the TRF micromirror. As a result, in operation, the micromirror  plate  is  close  to  its  underlying  layer  and  exbits  an  overdamped  behavior  which  is  due  to  the  significant squeezed film air damping. From the dynamic study of the micromirror in chapter 4  under 50 V base voltage, the point to point rotation of the micromirror has negligible overshoot  but a long rise time, i.e., slow response speed. Since the generic approach lacks the flexibility to  improve  the  scanning  time  for  each  segment,  an  advanced  point  distribution  methodology  is  developed in this section for both the visbile segmnets and the transitional segments so that the  scanning time for each segment can be adjusted and a good quality display can be obtained even  for higher refreshing rate, i.e.,  40 Hz.    The point distribution method for the visible segments is illustrated in Fig. 5.13. Assuming that 

there are n points assigned to a line segment, e.g., n = 6 in Fig. 5.13. Among the assigned n points,  2 points are the start and end points of the segment, e.g., point 1 and point 6 in Fig. 5.13. The rest  of the points are the inserted points which are added in addition to the start and end points. The  last second point is defined as the peak point, e.g., point 5 in Fig. 5.13, which lies on the extension  line of the segment following its direction and has the largest distance with the start point among  all the points distributed on the segment. The rest of the inserted points are then evenly distributed  111   

    between the start point and the peak point. Thanks to the peak point, the step size between the  inserted points are increased compared to those generated using the generic display approach and  have  an  even  distribution.  The  point  distribution  generated  using  the  generic  approach  is  also  shown in Fig. 5.13 as grey dashed lines and dots for comparison. The last point is assigned to the  end point of the segment which guarantees the location of the laser beam lies at the end point at  the end of the scanning. The larger slope of the black solid line compared to the grey dashed line  in Fig. 5.13 indicates that the points distributed using the proposed approach have a larger step  size. It determines that the voltage variations between the points are also larger than those of the  points which are evenly distributed. Also since the electrostatic torque provided by the actuators  is proportional to the square of the driving voltage, a larger voltage variation between the points  will lead to larger increment of the actuation torques which accelerate the micromirror faster. The  distance that the peak point goes beyond the end point is defined as the overshoot. Usually the  percentage  of  overshoot  is  used  to  describe  the  magnitude  of  the  overshoot,  which  is  the  ratio  between the overshoot of the peak point and the length of the segment. The proposed distribution  approach can be widely used for the visible line segments. It is guaranteed in the point number  assignment that all the visible line segments have more than two points assigned so that the above  mentioned distribution approach can be applied. The distribution function is expressed in Eq. (5.5).

    Where fVisLinei(k) is the distribution function for the ith segment if it is a visible line segment. k is  the sequence number of the point that is distributed on the ith segment which is from 1 to n(i). n(i)  is the total number of points assigned to the segment. pti0 and pti1 are 2-element vectors which are  the  coordinates  of  the  start  and  end  points  of  the  ith  segment.  OsVisLine(i)  is  the  percentage  of  overshoot of the peak point on the visible line segment. It is an adaptive factor that changes with  the segment length and the angle between the ith segment with its previous segment. The design  of the adaptive function OsVisLine will be discussed in the next section.     The visible curve segments due to their small lengths have only one point assigned for each 

segment. They are treated as a special case of the visible line segment with the only point being  the peak point which is located on the extension line of the segment. The distribution function is  expressed in Eq. (5.6).

(5.6) 

Where fVisCurvei is the distribution function for the ith segment if it is a curve segment. pti0 and pti1  are 2-element vectors which are the coordinates of the start and end points of the curve segment.  OsVisCurve is the percentage of the overshoot of the peak point which is usually a constant for all the  curve segments since their lengths are similar. It is noted that instead of assigning only one point,  two points are assigned to the first curve segment of a cluster of curve segments to avoid from  losing the start point of the first curve segment. Between the two points, the first one is the start  point of the curve segment and the allocation of the second point follows Eq. (5.6).    As  mentioned  above,  the  response  speed  of  the  scanning  laser  beam  can  be  improved  by 

increasing the step size between the neighboring control points. Since the transitional segments  are invisible, a more aggresive strategy can be used to distribute the control points on them. Instead  of distributing points between the start and peak point on the visible line segment, the points of the  transitional segment are distributed between the peak point and the end point as illustrated in Fig.  5.14. The first and the last point of the control points are assigned to the start and end point of the  segment. The start point is followed by the peak point which goes beyond the end point. All of the  inserted points overshoot beyond the end point and are distributed between the peak point and the  end point which approach to the end point exponentially. With the points following the peak point  approaching the end point exponentially, the laser beam will be finally stabalized at the end point.  Instead of increasing the control voltages gradually in a step by step manner as on the visible line  113   

    segment,  a  large  voltage  variation  happens  at  the  beginning  of  the  scanning  of  the  transitional  segment and the large voltage is maintained during the whole scanning process. Consequently, the  laser beam will have a larger accelertation on the transitional segment than the visible segment of  the same length.  The distribution function is expressed in Eq. (5.7).

Where  fTrani(k) is the distribution functions for  ith segment if it is a transitional segment.  k is the  sequence number of the point that is distributed on the ith segment which is from 1 to n(i). n(i) is  the total number of points assigned to the segment.  pti0 and  pti1 are 2-element vectors which are  the  coordinates  of  the  start  and  end  points  of  the  ith  segment.  OsTran(i)  is  the  percentage  of  overshoot of the peak point which is also an adaptive parameter which changes with the length of  the transitional segment.   5.4.2.1 Overshoot function design   In  the  distribution  functions  of  the  visible  line  segment  and  the  transitional  segment,  the 

percentage of overshoot of OsVisLine and OsTran change with different segments. The percentage of  overshoot indicates the control effort that is required for each segment. If a segment requires more  control  effort  of  the  micromirror,  it  implies  that  a  larger  percentage  of  overshoot  needs  to  be  assigned for the segment. The control effort required for each segment is related to the length of  the  segment  and  its  angle  with  the  previous  segment.  The  aim  of  this  section  is  to  design  the  functions of OsVisLine and OsTran so that each segment can be assigned with a proper amount of the  percentage of overshoot which further leads to less distorted display in high refreshing rate.   

114   

      The control effort for each segment is determined by its angle with the previous segment and 

its segment length. The effect of the angle with the previous segment is illustrated in Fig. 5.15. In  Fig. 5.15, two intersected line segments with equal length and different intersection angles of 30°,  90° and 120° are shown in (a) ­ (c) which are assumed to be the desired scanning trajectory of the  laser beam. The scanning direction is from point A to C through B which is the intersection point.  In order for the laser beam to follow the segment, its velocity should be in the same direction as  the segment. Usually when the laser beam reaches the intersection point, e.g., B, there is a residual  speed which has the same direction as the scanning direction of the previous segment. Assume that  B' is a point on BC and has the same magnitude of the velocity as  VB. In order for the scanning  velocity to change from  VB  to  VB', a larger velocity variation is required for the case which has a  larger intersection angle  of the segments as illustrated in Fig. 5.15 (d). Also since the  velocity  variation (V) and the acceleration (a) has the relation a = V / t, for the same amount time t, the  required acceleration and then actuation force/torque increases with the increase of the intersection  angle. The actuation torque is a measure of the control effort and the larger the required actuation  torque is, the larger control effort that is needed for the scanning.     More specifically, if the intersection angle is smaller than 90° as shown in Fig. 5.10 (a), a small 

positive residual speed makes the scanning of the second segment faster since residual speed has  a velocity  component along the second segment, which has the same direction as the scanning  direction  of  the  second  segment.  It  provide  an  initial  velocity  for  the  scanning  of  the  second  segment and makes it faster. However, if the turning angle is larger than 90° as shown in Fig. 5.15  (c), the residual velocity will have an opposite direction with the desired scanning direction of the  second segment. In order to achieve a same scanning time for the second segment as the former  case, larger actuation force is required. In this case, significant control effort is required to fast  scan the intersected segments with larger than 90° intersection angle. From the analysis above, the  effect of the intersection angle to the percentage of overshoot assigned to the peak point of the line  segment is expressed in Eq. (5.7).

Where OsVisLine(i) represents the  percentage of overshoot of the peak point of ith segment if it is a  visible line segment.  and  are two parameters that control the percentage of the overshoot. l(i)  and (i) are the length of the ith segment and its intersection angle with the previous segment. If  the length of segment is not long enough, i.e., smaller than the threshold  LT and the intersection  angle  is  larger  than  90°  the  extra  control  effort  brought  by  the  intersection  angle  needs  to  be  considered as a variable term besides a constant overshoot, i.e., , as shown in the first equation in  Eq. (5.7). The rest of the segments are applied a constant overshoot, i.e., .  

116   

      As  mentioned  early,  the  transitional  segments  have  much  larger  tolerance  on  the  point 

distribution than the visible line segment. As a result, the effect of the intersection angle on the  percentage of overshoot can be neglected and is  simply related to the length of the segment as  expressed in Eq. (5.8).

  Fig. 5.16 Display setup.    The method of assigning corresponding driving voltages to each of the control point is similar 

to  the  one  discussed  in  [123].  MATLAB  surface  fitting  toolbox  is  used  to  create  a  calibration  model  for  each  of  the  actuator  separately  using  the  data  from  the  calibration  matrix.  Then  the  control points are fed into the calibration model to obtain the driving voltages for the control points. 

117   

    The voltage signals are sent out by PXI 7854R FPGA data acquisition card and then are amplified  by high voltage amplifier and then applied to the micromirorr as shown in Fig. 5.16.     The control voltages generated by the advanced approach is used to drive the micromirror to  display various patterns and the design parameters in the point number assignment, i.e., T1, T2, T1',  T2', Ks, Km, Kl, Ks', Km', Kl' and point distribution, i.e, , , LT, OsTranMax and OsCurve are found from  trail and error methods. It has been found that all the parameters for the point number assignment  and some of the parameters for point distribution are consistant for different display patterns and  the optimal parameters found are listed in the Table 5.1.  and  are two parameters that are mainly  used to tune the display quality. They change with the display pattern and refreshing rate.   Table 5.1 The optimal parameters obtained using tral and error methods.

obtianed are used to drive the micromirror to display. The display pattern  shown in Fig. 5.8 is  displayed with different frequencies i.e., from 30 Hz to 50 Hz. The display pattern can be used for  automotive HUD which is composed of 3 digits "117" and a simple map of the road, i.e., the two  orthogonal lines. The triangle indicates the current location of the vehicle. The control voltages  generated using the generic display approach presented in [109], [123] are also used to control the  same micromirror to display the same patterns under the same display frequencies. Comparisons  are maded between the display results which are shown in Figs. 5.17 ~ 5.19.     It can be observed from Fig. 5.17 that sharp corners can be well displayed such as those in digit 

"7"  and  the  triangle  shape.  However,  the  corners  are  all  rounded  in  the  display  using  generic  display approach. This indicates that the presented approach is able to compensate for the slow  response speed of the micromirror under 50 V base voltage. With the refreshing rate increase, it  can be concluded from Figs. 5.18 ~ 5.19 that the display results using the generic display approach  deteriorate  significantly.  However,  the  advanced  display  approach  is  able  to  adjust  the  design  parameters ( and ) to obtain much better quality display. Namely, the advanced display approach  has the flexibility to adjust the design parameters to obtain good quality displays under different  118   

    refreshing rate (especillay in high frequencies), which cannot be achieved using generic display  approach.

      The advanced display approach not only can improve the display quality of the micromirror 

presented in chapter 4, but also it can be used on the previously developed ORF micromirror to  improve  the  display  quality.  A  display  module  based  on  the  ORF  micromirror  was  previously  developed. Its display result using the generic display approach with refreshing rate about 43 Hz  is shown as the left display pattern of Fig. 5.20. The designed display pattern is almost the same  as the one shown in Fig. 5.9 except that the arrow is designed to be closer to the digits. It is noted  that the generated control voltages are amplified by a scale factor to improve the response speed.  The advanced display approach is used to display the pattern designed in Fig. 5.9 so that the edge  of the arrow and the digit "5" can be clearly identified. The display result is shown as the right  display of Fig. 5.20. In order to avoid the influence of the viewer's subjective factor and make fair  comparison between the two display results, some comparison guidelines are made as follows. A  good display result should have a shape closer to that of the designed pattern. More specificly, the  straight  lines  of  the  designed  pattern  should  be  as  straight  as  possible  in  a  good  display.  The  intersection angles between the segments should be preserved as much as possible, i.e., the sharp  corners should stay as sharp as the original design. By using the above comparision guidelines it  can be concluded that the advanced display approach can also improve the display quality of the  previously developed micromirror. For example, for the display pattern in the right of Fig. 5.20  the straight lines of the letters "V" and "T" are straighter than those of the left display pattern. The  arrow of the right display  pattern preserves the sharp corners of the original  design in Fig. 5.9  while the arrow of the left display pattern suffers from a siginificant distortion and all the sharp  corners  are  rounded.  It  can  also  be  observed  that  the  advanced  display  approach  has  smaller  improvement on the curves than on the straight lines. For example there is limited improvement  on the letter "C".     Finally the display pattern shown in Fig. 5.9 is displayed using the TRF micromirror and the 

advanced display approach. The display result is compared with that of the previously developed  display  module  based  on  the  ORF  micromirror  and  generic  display  approach.  The  comparison  setup is shown in Fig. 5.21. The display module is positioned so that the micromirror inside is  approximately aligned with the micromirror on the fixture. As a result, both micromirrors have the  same distance to the screen and the size of the generated display can be directly compared. The  comparison result in 43 Hz is shown in Fig. 5.22. It can be seen that the displayed pattern using 

120   

    TRF micromirror and the advanced display approach is much superior in both the size and the  display quality than that of the ORF micromirror with generic display approach. 

  Fig. 5.20 Display results of the ORF micromirror in 43 Hz. Left: Generic display approach.  Right: Advanced display approach.   5.7 Summary   From the experiments and discussions above, it can be concluded that the proposed advanced 

display approach can be  widely used on the micromirrors of the similar type and is  capable to  achieve displays with much better display qualities than that using the generic display approach,   especially in high display frequencies. The advanced display have large improvement on the line  segments. However, the improvement of the display quality of the curve segments are limited. The  TRF micromirror together with the advanced display approach can generate superior displays both  in size and quality than that using the ORF micromirror and generic display approach.

Chapter 6 Application of the micromirror on automotive head-up display (HUD)
Part of this chapter is based on the following submitted paper:   Chao Fan and Siyuan He, "Micromirror Based virtual image automotive head-up display", Journal of microsystem technologies, 2015.  Part of this chapter is based on the following to be submitted paper:   Chao  Fan  and  Siyuan  He,  "Micromirror  based  automotive  head  up  display  (HUD)",  IEEE Transaction on Mechatronics.       One application of the micromirror based LSD that is getting more attentions is automotive 

HUD.  This  chapter  meets  the  objective  3  of  the  thesis  and  constructs  a  HUD  system  on  experimental cars using the micromirror presented in chapter 4 and advanced display approach  presented  in  chapter  5.  The  display  module  is  designed  and  fabricated,  which  integrates  the  micromirror and light source and optical components. Two configurations of automotive HUD,  i.e., real image and virtual image HUD are built. The display results are shown. The light efficiency  and vibration reliability are tested for the micromirror.   6.1 Design and working principle 6.1.1 Display module   The display module is composed of a laser diode module, a micromirror, and a double concave 

lens, as shown in Fig. 6.1. A collimated 532 nm laser diode module with modulation capability  (up to 3 kHz) is used as the light source. The output power of the laser is about 3 mW with a beam  diameter smaller than 1.2 mm which falls into class IIIa. A pinhole of 0.9 mm is bonded in front  of the lens of the laser diode module which is used to reduce the diameter of the laser beam so that  it  fits  the  size  of  the  micromirror  plate  (1  mm  in  diameter).  The  micromirror  is  packaged  in  a  CQFP44 chip and is soldered on a small PCB board for wire connection. There is an anti-reflective  (AR) coated glass bonded on top of the CQFP44 chip to seal the micromirror inside the chip cavity.  This can protect the micromirror from being contaminated by the particles in the air. According to  the  optical  simulation  and  optimization  performed  in  chapter  4,  a  12  mm  diameter  AR  coated  123   

    double concave lens with 12 mm effective focal length is used to magnify the scanning. The AR  coating is able to provide smaller than 1.75% reflectance per surface for 400 ~ 700 nm [145].     A set of mechanical parts are designed to integrate all of the parts into a small device, which 

includes base plate, laser fixture, micromirror fixture and lens fixture. All fixtures are located on  the base plate and provide 1D rotation with the rotational axis normal to the base plate. Besides  the  micromirror  and  lens  fixtures  are  able  to  provide  2D  translation  in  the  base  plane,  vertical  translation. All the fixtures work together to align the optical components with the laser beam. It  is desired that the incident laser beam is aligned with the micromirror plate and the reflected laser  beam is aligned in the center of the double concave lens. The schematic of the integrated device is  shown in Fig. 6.1. By controlling the rotation of the micromirror, the reflected laser beam is able  to  scan  through  a  designed  trajectory  repeatedly  and  rapidly.  During  the  scanning,  the  laser  is  modulated to be turned on for the visible trajectories and turned off for the transitional trajectories.  By combining the micromirror scanning and laser modulation, the desired laser patterns can be  generated.

    6.1.2 Real image and virtual image configuration of automotive HUD   There are two configurations of the automotive HUD, i.e., real image (or direct projection) and 

virtual image HUD. Real image HUD generates a real image directly on the surface of a combiner  or the windshield. On the other hand, virtual image HUD generates a virtual image in front of the  divers' sightline which appears to be on the road in the front. The advantages of the real image  HUD  are  simple  configuration,  high  illuminance  efficiency  and  is  suitable  for  aftermarket  installation. However it requires the driver to refocus to obtain the information, i.e., move focus  from the road to inner surface of the windshield. On the contrary, the virtual image does not require  the refocusing for the driver to obtain the HUD information. This comes with the sacrifice of the  device volume and lower the illumination efficiency of the display module. Also due to the long  optical path length required, it is not easy to be installed aftermarket.     The  proposed  real  image  HUD  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.2.  The  display  module  is  directed  to  the 

windshield  and  can  be  positioned  either  on  the  dashboard  or  buried  under  it.  A  partial  mirrorreflective  transparent  film  is  attached  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  windshield  with  a  diffusereflective transparent film stacked on top of it. The real image is generated on the surface of the  diffuse-reflective  film  since  the  laser  vector  graphics  projected  on  it  illuminate  to  various  directions. As a result, the pattern can be observed from a large angle. The underlying reflective  film is used to reflect the transmitted light and enhance the brightness of the display.

      The optical setup of the virtual image automotive HUD is shown in Fig. 6.3. The scanning 

laser beams from the display module is first reflected by a metallic coated reflective mirror. The  angle of the reflective mirror is adjusted to reflect the laser beams onto a projection screen where  a real image is formed. The real image is then partially reflected by a transparent HUD reflector  which is placed on top of the dashboard. Consequently, a virtual image is generated in front of the  HUD  reflector.  It  is  noted  that  the  partially  mirror-reflective  film  same  as  the  one  used  as  the  bottom  film  in  real  image  HUD  configuration  can  also  be  coated  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  windshield instead of using a HUD reflector.

fixtures are fabricated using aluminum and can be fixed on the base by screws. The power supply  of the laser, and the driving signals are provided using external equipments. The signal flow is  shown in Fig. 6.5. The driving signals together with the laser modulation signal are generated using  MATLAB software first using the advanced display approach presented in chapter 5. Then the  data is saved as MATLAB data file. It is noted that the control signals generated using MATLAB  are low voltage (0 ~ 5 V). The PXI-7854R multifunction data acquisition board from National  Instrument which can be programed using LabVIEW software and can interface with MATLAB  126   

    data file is used to output the low voltage control signals. There are 5 channels of output signals  which correspond to the four driving signals of the micromirror and a modulation signal for the  laser. The generated signals are then amplified 50 times using high voltage amplifiers (model 2350  from Tegam). The amplified signals  are then applied to the micromirror. The laser modulation  signal is sent to the laser modulation control circuit which comes with the laser diode module.

not  measured  from  the  fabricated  display  module  since  it  is  difficult  to  position  the  detector  between the optical components of the integrated display module in Fig. 6.4. Also since the same  micromirror and the optical components are used for both system, the light efficiency in percentage  should be consistent for both display system. The laser power attenuation in percentage is shown  in Fig. 6.6 below. It is assumed that the input power of the laser beam is 100% at the micromirror.  The laser power reduces to 28.5% after it is reflected by the micromirror. This is mainly caused  127   

    by poor surface quality of the micromirror plate which is determined by the fabrication process,  i.e., surface micromachining. The surface micromachining requires releasing holes and dimples  on the micromirror plate [112]. As a result, the reflected laser beam contains a lot of light noise  i.e., small laser dots, as shown in Fig.6.7. The lens further reduces the laser power about 1.5 %.  This is due to the fact that the light noise contained in the reflected beam are significantly diverged  from the main beam owing to the amplification of the double concave lens. The reflected laser  beams before and after going through the double concave lens are shown in Fig. 6.7. It can be  observed  that  the  clustered  small  dots  are  spreading  out  after  the  double  concave  lens.  When  measuring the power, only the center beam is measured which leads to the decrease of the laser  power measurement after the concave lens. It is noted that in the real application, the pinhole which  is used to limit the laser beam size will further reduce the light efficiency.

    6.2.2 Real image and HUD setup   The prototype of real image is shown in Fig. 6.8. A second hand car is cut in the middle and 

the part that has the windshield and the dash board is used to form the two configurations of the  automotive HUD in lab environment. In order to clearly demonstrate the setup of the HUDs, the  HUD is set up in the center area of the dashboard instead in the dashboard on the driver's side.  The air condition module of car is removed in the center of the dashboard to make enough space  for the HUDs. A rectangular hole is drilled through the dashboard to make optical path for the  projection. Due to the relative large size of the display module, the display module is positioned  under the dashboard instead of on it. A tailored cardboard is fixed at the bottom of the inside space  of the dashboard which works as the base for display module. The display module is bond with an  "L" shape stand which is made of a thin aluminum sheet which is flexible to be bend. It is used to  adjust  the  pitch  angle  of  the  display  module.  The  display  module  and  the  "L"  shape  stand  are  positioned on the base cardboard. When installing the display module and adjusting its position,  the display need to be turned on so that the position of the image on the windshield can be observed  in  real  time.  A  white  paper  is  attached  to  the  outside  of  the  windshield  and  covers  the  whole  projection area, so that the projection image can be observed while adjusting the position of display  module. Also the mirror-reflective film is attached to the inside of the windshield in the same area  to make sure the reflected laser beam is directed to the viewer in front of the film. The reflected  light will enhance the brightness on the diffuse-reflective film that will be stacked on the mirrorreflective film. By adjusting the horizontal position and pitch angle of the display module, a best  gesture of the display module can be found at which the whole projected pattern can go through  the rectangular hole and be observed on the white paper and the projected light will be reflected to  viewer in front of the projection films. Then the diffuse-reflective film which has the same size as  the mirror-reflective film is bonded on top of it. As a result, a bright display can be observed if  looking in front of the coated films. A projector is used to generate a background image to simulate  the views on the road. The vector pattern designed in chapter 5 is display in 40 Hz refreshing rate  and the display result is shown in Fig. 6.8 and Fig. 6.9. It can be seen that the real image of the  display has a large viewing angle.

The used mirror-reflective film is from Garmin and is widely used for LCD based automotive 

HUD.  The  diffuse-reflective  film  is  the  anti-glare  coating  film  for  the  mobile  devices.  The  transparency of both films are tested in the outdoor environment as shown in Fig. 6.10. The two  films are separately tested for their transparency first (shown in (a) and (b)). It is can be seen that  the  mirror-reflective  film  is  much  more  transparent  than  the  diffuse-reflective  film.  The  transparency of the two films with the diffuse-reflective film stacked on of the reflective film is  exhibited in (c). It can be concluded that the current selected defuse-reflective is the main barrier  for the transparency of the display films. Still the current diffuse-reflective film is already the best  among  serval  diffuse-reflective  films  that  are  tested  for  the  presented  real  image  HUD  setup.  Usually there is a tradeoff between the transparency and the ability of diffusing the light of the  diffuse-reflective  film.  More  research  needs  to  be  conducted  as  the  further  work  to  develop  a  defuse-reflective that is suitable for the real image HUD setup presented in this section.   6.2.3 Virtual image HUD setup   The virtual image HUD utilize the same experimental car as the real image HUD. The setup is 

shown in Fig. 6.11.  Similar to the real image HUD a cardboard is used as the base for the whole  setup. A metallic coated fold mirror is bonded on an "L" shape flexible aluminum sheet which can  adjust its pitch angle. A small display screen is mounted on the inside of one edge of the cavity  which is opposite to the fold mirror as shown in Fig. 6.11. The display screen uses the material  used for the projection screen which is highly diffuse reflective. A HUD reflector which has the  similar characteristic with the mirror-reflective film is positioned on top of the dashboard above  the cavity. Two small "L" shape flexible stands are attached to the reflector to adjust its pitch angle.  131   

    The pitch angle of the fold mirror, display screen and the HUD reflector are needed to be adjusted  corporately to make the display pattern visible to the viewer in front of the HUD reflector. The  display  image  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.13.  It  can  be  seen  that  in  addition  to  the  vector  graphics  the  projection screen can also be seen in the virtual image. This is due to the fact that the background  light i.e., the interior illumination of the room, is relatively strong and illuminated on the projection  screen. This can be solved by installing a unidirectional glass on the cavity so that the outside light  cannot be illuminated on the projection screen. Also the whole HUD system needs to be properly  sealed to prevent the interference of the background light.

  (b)  Fig. 6.14 (a) Micromirror vibration test system (b) Setup on the shaker.    A vibration test has been performed to test the reliability of the micromirror. An aluminum 

circular plate with two clamp fixtures is used to fix the micromirror and connect with a shaker as  shown  in  Fig.  6.14.  There  are  two  fixtures  on  the  circular  plate  which  are  used  to  fix  the  micromirror  horizontally  and  vertically  so  that  the  reliability  tests  can  be  performed  on  two  orthogonal directions of the micromirror. There is a small aluminum connector that is glued on the  134   

    backside of the micromirror chip using epoxy adhesive which is a solid connection and has high  strength. In the test, the aluminum connector is clamped on the horizontal and vertical clamps and  most  of  the  vibration  can  be  conducted  on  the  tested  micromirror.  The  shaker  is  driven  by  sinusoidal  signals  which  will  drive  the  shaker  to  have  a  sinusoidal  acceleration.  A  piezo  accelerometer is screwed on the circular plate so that the real time acceleration can be captured  and monitored from a computer. Before the test, the micromirror is placed in the display system  (similar  to  the  one  shown  in  Fig.  4.6)  to  scan  some  straight  lines.  The  scanning  range  of  the  micromirror for each line is manually marked on the display screen. For each test, the sinusoidal  acceleration  is  maintained  about  30  s  then  the  micromirror  is  taken  off  from  the  clamp  and  positioned in the display system to scan the same straight lines that is previously marked on the  display screen. If the micromirror after the acceleration test is still able to scan the same lines, it is  then  tested  for  higher  acceleration.  The  same  acceleration  is  performed  on  two  orthogonal  directions of the micromirror. The peak value of the acceleration is recorded for each test and the  maximum acceleration applied is 5G under which the micromirror is still properly functional.    6.3 Compact design of display module   The size of the display module is important for the automotive HUD application due to the 

limited space on the dashboard or under it. The prototype presented in the previous section is still  relatively large and as a result, in real image HUD setup there is not enough space to place it on  the dashboard; in virtual image HUD setup the display module has to extend beyond the space  under the dashboard. A more compact display module is developed in this section.     The compact design of the display module is shown in Fig. 6.15 which is composed of two 

fold mirrors, a laser diode module, a double concave lens, a micromirror and fixtures for the optical  components. In order to save the space, the laser is placed on the base plate with its longitudinal  direction parallel with the longitudinal direction of the base plate. A fold mirror is used to direct  the laser beam to the micromirror. The fold mirror is mounted on a fixture which is able to rotate  about the axis normal  to the base plate. The micromirror is  soldered on a printed circuit  board  which is mounted on an aluminum slider. The vertical position of the micromirror can be adjusted  by sliding the slider along a slide track. The slide track can also rotate along a vertical axis. The  reflected laser is then directed by a second fold mirror. The double concave lens is fixed in a lens  holder which can move vertically in a slide track. The lens slide track and the fold mirror holder  135   

    can  move  along  two  tracks  on  the  base  plate  so  that  the  distance  from  the  micromirror  to  the  concave lens can be adjusted to obtain a sharp image. An enclosure is also designed as shown in  Fig. (b). The overall dimension of the compact display module is 84 mm × 40 mm × 35 mm which  is  about  only  36%  of  the  prototype  of  the  display  module  presented  in  the  above  section.  The  display result is shown in Fig. 6.16.

The compact display module is used to construct a real image HUD as shown in Fig. 6.17. The 

display module is positioned on the dashboard attributed to its small volume. It can be used as a  aftermarket  product  which  can  be  easily  installed  by  the  customer.  It  is  noted  that  the  diffusereflective film is also improved with higher transparency than the one used above. The comparison  of the transparency is shown in Fig. 6.18. The viewing angle of the constructed HUD is tested to  be about ± 60°.

The visibility of the real image HUD has been tested in the lab environment. The experiment 

setup is  shown in Fig. 6.19. Two high power  light with their power adjustable are used  as the  external light source. In the experiment, the display result is recorded using the camera for various  illuminance from 0 to 15000 Lux outside of the windshield. The illuminance is measured using a  138   

    lux meter from the outside of the windshield right above the display pattern. It has been observed  that the display results starts to be washed away when the external result is higher than 6800 Lux.  Some examples of the display results under different external illumination is shown in Fig. 6.20.

6.4 Summary and comparison with the other HUDs   The developed HUD has a small profile which enables it not only to be originally integrated 

with  the  car  but  also  installed  as  an  aftermarket  device  on  the  dashboard.  For  example  the  dimensions of the developed compact display module is about 8.4 × 4.0 × 3.5 cm  which is smaller  in length and width direction than most of the commercial HUD modules that can be positioned  on  top  of  the  dashboard,  e.g.,  1)  The  on-dashboard  HUD  display  module  from  Garmin  has  a  dimension  of  10.8  ×  8.8  ×  1.9  cm  2)  The  on-dashboard  HUD  display  module  from  Navdy  is  139   

    claimed to have a size of 14 × 13 × 9.5 cm 3) The NavGate suspension type HUD display module  from Pioneer has a size of 20 × 19 × 12 cm . It is noted that the height of the developed compact  display module is currently limited by the size of the micromirror packaging and the size of its  PCB adapter, both of which can be further significantly reduced. The length and width dimension  can  also  be  further  reduced  by  using  laser  diode  instead  of  commercial  laser  diode  modules.  Comparing  to  the  conventional  display  modules  which  are  buried  under  the  dashboard,  the  advantage is even more obvious. The display module for the conventional HUD (virtual image  HUD) should be at  least  twice the size of the displayed virtual  image.  In this  case, in order to  display the same image size (5 inch) as the real image HUD presented above, the display module  should  be  at  least  has  a  dimension  of  18  ×  18  cm  (height  is  not  considered).  Furthermore,  the  developed real image HUD has a simple structure which only requires the projection film and the  display module which enables it to be easily installed after the manufacture.    The developed HUD system has a much lower cost than the currently available ones due to the 

low cost of the micromirror and the simple structure of the optical setup. Since the micromirror  requires  only  two  thin  layers,  it  can  be  fabricated  using  commercial  fabrication  process,  i.e.,  PolyMUMPs  which  leads  to  good  fabrication  yield  and  low  cost.  It  has  been  estimated  by  the  MEMSCAP the PolyMUMPs provider that the cost of a single micromirror is less than 5 dollar  for mass production. Due to the simple structure, the display module will have a relative low cost  (less  than  20  dollars).  However,  for  the  LCD,  DMD  and  LCoS  based  HUD,  a  single  display  generation unit costs more than 20 dollars without considering other optical components required  in  the  display  module.  For  example,  the  TI  DMD  micromirror  array  DLP3000Q1  which  is  automotive qualified chip cost more than 100 dollars even with large purchase quantities. Also the  developed real image HUD has very large viewing angle, i.e. ±60°, compared to that of the virtual  image HUD, i.e., 5° [146],  which is the main HUD setup of the products on the market.

Chapter 7 Conclusions and future work
7.1 Conclusions and contributions (1) Developed two novel electrostatic out-of-plane microactuators    Two  novel  actuators,  i.e.,  two-row-finger  (TRF)  and  two-width-finger  (TWF)  electrostatic 

repulsive-force microactuators have been developed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. Both actuators  have  been  fabricated  using  PolyMUMPs  and  tested.  The  measured  results  show  that  the  TRF  actuator is able to achieve 11.5° mechanical rotation and the ORF actuator is able to achieve 7.6°  rotation under 150 V DC driving voltage. Two mathematical models have been developed for them  respectively, which combine the analytical derivations and numerical simulations. The models are  able to evaluate the rotation angle variations with the change of driving voltages. The calculated  results from the model match well with the testing results. The discrepancies between the model  and the test results are approximately 8% and 11.8% at 150 V driving voltage for the TRF and  TWF  actuators  respectively.  The  models  can  be  used  to  predict  the  rotation  angles  of  the  two  actuators, which can save significant time than numerical simulations. The methodology used in  developing the model for these two actuators can be used to build models for other electrostatic  actuators. It has been proved that both actuators can achieve much larger rotation angle than that  of the previously reported repulsive-force actuators of the same actuator size, spring stiffness and  driving voltage. The rotation angle improvements of these two actuator are about 100% and 33%  at 150 V respectively.     Besides of the advantage of lager rotation angle, these two actuators do not suffer from the 

"pull-in" instability associated with the conventional electrostatic actuators. In addition, these two  actuators  require  only  two  thin  layers  which  can  be  easily  fabricated  using  mature  and  commercially available surface micromachining process. The successful development of the two  repulsive-force actuators and their models meet the objective 1 of the thesis.   (2) Developed a 2D scanning micromirror     A 2D scanning micromirror has been developed in Chapter 4 based on the novel TRF actuator. 

A vector scanning display system has been built using this micromirror. Both static and dynamic  performances are tested. It has been proved that the micromirror has much larger rotation angle  (more  than  twice)  and  faster  response  speed  than  those  of  the  ORF  micromirror  which  has  141   

    approximately the same size and spring stiffnesses. The development of the micromirror meets the  first part of the objective 2 of the thesis.   (3) Developed an advanced display approach      An advanced display approach has been developed in Chapter 5 which is able to display laser 

patterns with less distortion and higher refreshing frequency compared to the previously developed  generic  display  approach.  The  advanced  display  approach  includes  steps  of  the  camera  based  calibration, point distributing and voltage allocating. All the steps are easy to be implemented in  both the micromirrors developed in this thesis and previously. The experimental tests have been  conducted to verify the advanced display approach. The successful development of the advanced  display approach meets the second part of objective 2 of the thesis.  (4) Developed an automotive HUD system    Two  display  modules  have  been  designed  and  fabricated,  which  integrates  the  laser,  the 

micromirror, and the optical components. One of them is more compact than the other. The display  modules have been used to form two configurations of the automotive HUD, i.e., real image and  virtual image HUDs. Both HUDs are installed in a testing car. Experimental results show that the  HUDs can generate display patterns with good quality in both configurations. The development of  the automotive HUD has met the objective 3 of the thesis.   7.2 Future work (1) Actuators    The models have been developed for the TRF and TWF microactuators in the thesis which can 

predict  the  rotation  angles  of  the  actuators  giving  all  the  dimensions  of  the  actuators  and  the  corresponding driving voltages. Furthermore, optimization models can be developed in the future  to  optimize  some  dimensions  of  the  actuator.  In  the  TRF  actuator,  the  dimensions  that  can  be  optimized include the finger width, the length of the lower and upper fingers and the upper spring  stiffness. For the TWF actuator, the dimension of the finger widths of the two-width finger can be  optimized.      Another future work that can potentially improve the dynamic performance of the actuator is 

to incorporate attractive driving force in the actuators. The repulsive-force actuators developed in  this thesis has a unidirectional driving force, i.e., electrostatic out-of-plane repulsive force. As a  142   

    result, the actuator's moving part relies on the mechanical restoring force to be pulled to its initial  position. It is possible that attractive force can be added to pull the moving part of the actuator  back to its initial position. This can be done by adding extra electrodes to form parallel-plate or  vertical comb-drive type actuators. As a result, the bidirectional actuation force based actuator has  a faster response speed.  (2) Micromirror     The micromirror presented in the thesis is fabricated using surface micromachining process 

which has releasing holes and dimples on the micromirror plate. Consequently, the micromirror  plate has a relatively poor surface quality which reduces the light efficiency. A potential solution  is  to  bond  a  metal  coated  SOI  mirror  plate  which  has  the  good  surface  quality  on  top  of  the  micromirror. More researches need to be done to develop such a bonding process to improve the  surface quality of the micromirror without sacrificing too much response speed.   (3) HUD    It has been mentioned in Chapter 6 of the thesis that the display films for the real image HUD 

configuration  is  of  low  transparency.  With  the  development  of  the  laser  scanning  display  technologies a projection film to be used for real image HUD is highly desired and worth further  research. One possible solution is to dope some small particles into the transparent film which can  make the film diffuse and reflective. The doped film can be bonded with a film or a glass which is  embedded with microlens.    The size of the display module and the HUD system can be further reduced by improving the 

integration  level  of  system.  For  example,  1)  Integrate  the  control  and  driving  circuit  with  the  display module; 2) Add a wireless communication module into the display module so that it can  receive and display information from other mobile devices such as a cellphone. 3) Use the laser  diode as the light source instead of a laser diode module which has a bulky volume. Meanwhile,  the  optical  system  design  needs  to  be  improved  to  obtain  sharp  displays.  Also  multiple  micromirrors can be integrated together to display more information. Laser diodes with multiple  colors can be integrated to generate colorful displays.     More reliability tests need to be performed according to the automotive industrial standards. 

The  tests  that  are  to  be  performed  include  the  impact  and  vibration  tolerance  and  temperature  143   

    tolerance. Also the visibility of the displayed pattern with respect to the background illumination  needs to be further studied in the outdoor environment.

Appendices
Appendix A   The 2-D electric field simulation is to provide discrete data for the surface fitting to obtain

finterdigitating_lower,  finterdigitating_upper  and  fnon-interdigitating_upper,  i.e.,  electrostatic  force  exerted  on  the  rotation fingers along the cross section with unit length and unit driving voltage. finterdigitating_lower,  finterdigitating_upper and fnon-interdigitating_upper are functions of hl and hu. The ranges of hl and hu should be  wide enough to cover all possible values of vertical distance between fixed and rotation fingers.  For a given actuator, according to Eqs. (2.5) to (2.8), the limits of hl and hu can be written as Eqs.  (A1) ~ (A4).          
0  hl_interdigitating  Llower sin  l_max    0  hl_non  interdigitating  ( Dlower _ upper  Blower _ 3 ) tan  l_max    0  hu_interdigitating  Llower tan  u_max    0  hu_non  interdigitating  ( Dlower _ upper  Llower cos  l_max ) tan  u_max   

(A1)  (A2)  (A3)  (A4) 

hl_interdigitating  and  hl_non-interdigitating are representations of  hl in the interdigitating area and noninterdigitating  area.  hu_interdigitating  and  hu_non-interdigitating  are  representations  of  hu  in  the  interdigitating area and non-interdigitating area. l_max and u_max are the maximum rotation angles  of lower and upper rotation fingers which are achieved under maximum driving voltage. If l_max  and u_max can be estimated, the range of hl and hu, i.e., hl_interdigitating, hl_non-interdigitating, hu_interdigitating,  and  hu_non-interdigitating  can  be  estimated.  The  actuator  can  be  simulated  in  CoventorWare  using  CosolveEM solver to perform coupled field simulation between mechanical and electrical domains.  However, converged results cannot be obtained for a driving voltage higher than 25 V when using  CosolveEM solver to simulate the present actuator due to the complexity of the electrodes of this  actuator. Since l_max and u_max and then the ranges of hl and hu (according to Eqs. (2.5) to (2.8))  are obtained when the driving voltage is 150 V, the coupled field simulation solver "CosolveEM"  of Coventorware cannot be used. Instead, the following method is used to roughly estimate the  maximum values of  l_max and  u_max and then the ranges of  hl and  hu, which uses only electrical  domain simulation instead of coupled field solver to obtain the torques generated by electric field  which acts on the lower and upper rotation fingers of the actuator at different combinations of  l  145   

    and u under a unit driving voltage. For any other driving voltage, the resulting electrostatic torque  equals to the square of the driving voltage multiplying the torque of unit driving voltage. Thus  various curves of the torque acting on the lower rotation fingers, i.e., Tlower versus l at different u  for any driving voltage can be obtained. One example is shown in Fig. A.1 (a) when the driving  voltage is 150V. Similarly, various curves of the torques acting on the upper rotation fingers, Tlower  versus u at different l for any driving voltage can be obtained. One example of which is shown  in Fig. A.1 (b) under 150 V driving voltage. The mechanical  restoring torque generated by the  lower springs versus its rotation angles is plotted as a straight line in Fig. A.1 (a). The mechanical  restoring torque generated by the upper springs versus its rotation angles is plotted as a straight  line in Fig. A.1 (b).

Then intersection of the two curves in Fig. A.1 (c) represents the rotation angles of  the lower and upper rotation fingers at the driving voltage of 150 V, which are  l_max and  u_max.  Since the above method does not consider the coupling effect between mechanical and electrical  146   

    domains and is based on the simulation data of discrete rotation angles of l and u, it is not suitable  for simulating the performance of the actuator. But it is useful for approximately determining l_max  and u_max and then determining the ranges of hl and hu through trial and error verifying iteration.    Using  the  above  method,  l_max_estimate  and  u_max_estimate  are  estimated  to  be  9.4°  and  3.9°. 

l_max_estimate and u_max_estimate  are the estimated values of l_max and u_max using the above method.  The trial and error verifying iteration has the following four steps.  Step 1: l_max_estimate and u_max_estimate are rounded to the larger integers, i.e., l_max_estimate = 10° and  u_max_estimate = 4° which are used to calculate the ranges of hl and hu according to Eqs. (2.5) to (2.8),  i.e., hl_max_estimate and hu_max_estimate.  Step 2: hl_max_estimate and hu_max_estimate are the estimated ranges of hl and hu are used for simulation  to obtain finterdigitating_lower, finterdigitating_upper and fnon-interdigitating_upper and solve the maximum angles of  lower and upper rotation fingers, i.e., l_max_model and  u_max_model at the driving voltage of 150 V  using the model in Chapter 2.  Step 3-1: If there exists solutions to l_max_model and u_max_model, they are used to calculate maximum  hl and hu, i.e., hl_max_model and hu_max_model. If hl_max_model and hu_max_model are smaller than the estimated  ranges,  i.e.,  hl_max_estimate  and  hu_max_estimate,  then  the  estimated  ranges  are  appropriate  and  the  verification iteration ends. Otherwise the estimated ranges, i.e., hl_max_estimate and hu_max_estimate, are  too small and Step 4 is the next step.    Step 3-2: If there is no solutions to  l_max_model and  u_max_model, the current estimated ranges, i.e.,  hl_max_estimate and hu_max_estimate are too small and Step 4 is the next step.   Step 4: An increment of 10 m is added to the current hl_max_estimate and hu_max_estimate and then go to  Step 2.     Using the above method, the ranges of  hl and  hu in the interdigitating and non-interdigitating 

area are determined, i.e., interdigitating area, hl: 0 ~ 50 m, hu: 0 ~ 50 m, non-interdigitating area,  hl : 0 ~ 110 m, hu : 0 ~ 50 m.        147

    Appendix D Bonding process of the protective glass   The micromirror after the fabrication is positioned in a CQFP chip without cover. Due to the 

small size of the micromirror, the particles and moistures in the surrounding air and the humidity  level of the air may cause the failure of the micromirror. As a result, it is necessary to isolate the  micromirror with the outside environment without blocking the light path.     A 10 mm × 10 mm square AR window with high light transmission is selected to bond with 

the  chip.  Epoxy  adhesive  due  to  its  superior  abilities  of  high  strength,  resistance  to  high  temperature,  humidity  and  chemical  is  suitable  for  this  purpose.  The  Loctite  E-30CL  epoxy  is  selected as the boding glue which is stable in the temperature range -65° ~ 250° and is widely used  to bond glass and ceramic. It begins to harden in 30 min and reaches full strength in 24hours.    In  order  to  avoid  damaging  the  device  while  bonding,  a  reliable  bonding  process  has  been  developed to bond the window on top of the micromirror.    The setup for the bonding is shown in Fig. D.1 There is a vertical slider sliding along a tall 

cylinder post. A "L"  shape fixture is  attached with the vertical  slider. A  cavity is  made on the  surface of a Teflon cuboid. The size of the cavity is a little larger than the AR glass so that it can  fit in.    The process is listed below:  (1) Peel off the plastic protection layer on both side of the AR glass, and leave positioned on a  electrical grounded metal board for about 5 mins and then put it in the cavity on the Teflon for  later use. The AR glass comes with a thin plastic protection layers at each side of it. It has been  proved that when peeling off the protection layer, the electrostatic charges will be generated on  the glass. For some tests, if it is positioned on top of the micromirror with large amount of charge  it damaged the micromirror due to the possible large electrostatic force between the glass and the  microactuator.  Teflon  material  due  to  its  non-stick  nature  is  used  to  hold  the  glass  during  the  bonding process so that the glass or the micromirror can be easily release from it after the bonding  is finished.   (2) Squeeze the epoxy resin and hardener onto a flat and clean solid surface such as a piece of  silicon  wafer  and  mix  them  until  the  color  is  uniform.  Epoxy  adhesive  comes  with  resin  and  hardener which need to be mixed to start the curing process.   149   

    (3) Take off the metal lid on the chip and use double side tape to fix the chip on the "L" shape  fixture  with  the  chip  facing  down,  as  shown  in  the  Fig.  D.1  (a)  above.  In  this  process,  the  micromirror will be exposed directly to the operation environment and the potential to be damaged  increases with the time. As a result, it is necessary for the operator to maintain a small movement  in order to avoid too much air flow around the micromirror.

(b)  Fig. D.1 Setup for the bonding process.   (4) Use a piece of thin and clean board such as a piece of wafer to press and slide over the mixed  glue  that  was  prepared  until  a  uniform  thin  layer  of  the  mixture  is  formed.  This  step  may  be  repeated  serval  time  to  guarantee  the  generation  of  the  thin  and  uniform  layer  of  glue.  It  is  important  to  generate  a  thin  mixture  layer  so  that  when  the  micromirror  is  contacting  with  the  mixture, it won't have too much mixture squeezed into the cavity of the CQFP chip and cause  damage to the micromirror.   (5) Put the wafer with a thin layer of epoxy right under the chip. Lower the "L" shape steadily and  slowly until the front face of the chip makes contact with the mixture layer.   150   

    (6) Then slowly lift the "L" shape and take off the chip. Use hand to position the chip into the  cavity which contains the glass. Make sure that the front surface of the chip is flat and has a full  contact with the glass.   (7) Lower the "L" shape to apply bonding force to the back of the chip. Extra weight can be put  on the "L" shape to enhance the bonding force. The device will be ready to use after 24 hours.     The real bonding structure and the bonded micromirror is shown in Fig. D.2. The whole setup 

is on an optical bench. The black slider with a "L" shape attached to it is able to slide vertically  along the pillar. An aluminum board is inserted into the opening at the back of the black slider to  prevent it from rotating around the cylinder. In Fig. D.2 the "L" shape is applying the bonding  force to the back of a micromirror chip. The front of the chip is attached to an AR glass with epoxy  adhesive sandwiched between them. A clean silicon wafer (with a thick glass substrate) is used to  hold the epoxy. A micromirror chip without bonding, a piece of AR glass with protection plastic  cover and a Teflon brick is shown in Fig. D.3 (a). More than 10 chips has been bonded using the  same  process  and  it  has  been  proved  that  the  bonding  process  is  very  reliable  and  can  be  accomplished under the normal lab environment. A bonded micromirror is shown in Fig. D.3 (b).
