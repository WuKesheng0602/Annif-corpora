AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FREE VIBRATIONS OF CARBON NANOTUBES USING ANALYTICAL AND FINITE ELEMENT METHODS

Ishan Ali Khan Master of Applied Science, Aerospace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto (2016) Abstract Since their discovery, immense attention has been given to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), due to their exceptional thermal, electronic and mechanical properties and, therefore, the wide range of applications in which they are, or can be potentially, employed. Hence, it is important that all the properties of carbon nanotubes are studied extensively. This thesis studies the vibrational frequencies of double-walled and triple-walled CNTs, with and without an elastic medium surrounding them, by using Finite Element Method (FEM) and Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) formulations, considering them as Euler-Bernoulli beams coupled with van der Waals interaction forces. For FEM modelling, the linear eigenvalue problem is obtained using Galerkin weighted residual approach. The natural frequencies and mode shapes are derived from eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. For DSM formulation of double-walled CNTs, a nonlinear eigenvalue problem is obtained by enforcing displacement and load end conditions to the exact solution of single equation achieved by combining the coupled governing equations. The natural frequencies are obtained using Wittrick-Williams algorithm. FEM formulation is also applied to both double and triple-walled CNTs modelled as nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam. The natural frequencies obtained for all the cases, are in agreement with the values provided in literature.

1. Introduction
Carbon nanotubes have been under considerable observation and the subject of thousands of research publications every year, since their discovery. The global market for CNT primary grades is projected to reach $670.6 million market in 2019 [1]. This interest can be attributed to their exceptional properties as a result of their geometry, namely, the high aspect ratio i.e., the ratio of its length to its diameter, and its chirality. These properties enable the use of carbon nanotubes in a wide variety of applications, some of which are electronics, sensors, composite materials, biotechnology, environment, optical, chemical, and energy storage. Therefore, in order to effectively use carbon nanotubes in each of these fields, it is important that their properties and behavior are examined. In general, depending the property under observation, experimental or theoretical approaches are employed to study the properties and behavior of carbon nanotubes. Theoretical approaches are broadly categorised into atomistic modelling approach and continuum approach. The atomistic modelling approach, in turn, includes classical molecular dynamics approach, tight binding molecular approach and density functional approach [2]. Continuum approaches assume carbon nanotube to be continuous structures like bars, beams and shells. Though a great deal of research has been dedicated to finding the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes using experimental and molecular dynamics methods, relatively less amount of research has been carried out on vibration and buckling of carbon nanotubes using these approaches, as the computational time and effort required is tremendous. Also, the results obtained would be valid for a very specific time period in the cycle of loading, thus limiting the exposure to their behavior. Therefore, continuum methods are used as they overcome these challenges. Yakobson et al. [3] mention that the application of continuum-elastic methods to carbon nanotubes predicts their behavior just as well and credits the laws of continuum mechanics of being applicable even at a scale so small. The current research is focussed on finding the natural frequencies and mode shapes of carbon nanotubes by considering them as local and non-local Euler-Bernoulli beams, exploiting the generality of finite elements method, a very often used approximate numerical method in analysis of dynamics of continuum structures, and dynamic stiffness method, an `exact method' which harnesses the exact member theory and provides better accuracies for higher natural frequencies.

1.1 Outline of Finite Element Method (FEM) Finite element method (FEM) is probably one of the most well-known numerical methods used for structural analysis, with a proven track record owing to its adaptability ­ both in terms of complexity of structures and boundary conditions. It uses subdivision of the entire structure into smaller `elements' governed by the relevant partial differential equations. Shape or interpolation functions (like Hermite cubic interpolation functions ­ used quite often for their completeness) are used to express the approximate solutions. The use of these shape functions in the partial differential equations gives elemental, and ultimately global, mass and stiffness matrices. These matrices are then solved as a linear eigenvalue problem to obtain the system's natural frequencies and modes. Finite element continuous to be used in different commercial packages directed towards structural analysis like ANSYS®. The generality of this method stems from freedom in terms of defining the shape, boundary conditions, material properties of the structure and flexibility in terms of analysing complex structures which can include structures with different properties and/or different boundary conditions. The accuracy of FEM models can be considerably increased by increasing the number of elements being used. However for the analysis of structures at higher frequencies, finite element method has limited versatility, as it uses numerical approximation and large number of elements are required to obtain accurate results.

1.2 Outline of Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) Method Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) method uses a single frequency dependent matrix, instead of two stiffness and mass matrices used in finite element method. The formulation involves, where applicable, combining the coupled governing differential equations into one ordinary differential equation and a closed form solution is sought. Application of boundary conditions to this solution leads to the dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) of the system. The natural frequencies are obtained by solving resulting the non-linear eigenvalue problem. One of the biggest strength, and weakness of this method is the use of closed form solution of the differential equation. The closed form solution gives better accuracy, using a single element, even for higher frequencies but arriving at the closed form solution might prove to be a challenge, especially if the structure is complex and uses multiple structures with different properties and boundary conditions. An
2

innovative technique, Dynamic Finite Element (DFE), combines the precision of this method with the generality of finite element method and has proven to give better results by using trigonometric shape functions, derived from the exact solution. Nonetheless, it is out of the scope of this thesis and hence is not presented in depth.

1.3 Literature Review Vibration modelling and analysis of carbon nanotubes are important factors, eliciting extensive study, especially in applications such as oscillators and in non-destructive testing. The detection sensitivity of various nano-devices depends on their resonant frequency. Carbon nanotubes have considerably higher natural frequencies which could affect the system in which they are used and therefore it is required that their dynamic behavior is studied extensively. As mentioned earlier, continuum approach is preferred for studying the vibrational characteristics but a new hybrid technique, which links atomistic and continuum approaches, has also gained ground in the recent years. Odegard et al. [4] equated the molecular potential energy of nanomaterial with the strain energy of the continuum structure. Li and Chou christened this approach as `molecular structural mechanics approach' and studied the buckling of carbon nanotubes [5], natural frequencies of single-walled carbon nanotube modeled as nano-mechanical resonator [6] and multi-walled carbon nanotubes based nanomechanical resonators [7]. They modeled carbon nanotube as frame-like structure with carbon-carbon bonds as nodes. A review of their work was presented in 2006 [8]. Chandrasekhar et al. [9] and Hollerer and Celigoj [10] both employed mixed approach by forming the constitutive model using atomistic approach and parameterization of continuum elastic energy for proposing a Cosserat rod model and for buckling analysis of carbon nanotubes respectively. Continuum approach has seen the representation of carbon nanotubes as beams and shells for the most part. Very few studies like Hu et al. [11] and Budarapu et al. [12] studied vibrations of carbon nanotubes by considering them as continuum bars. Artan and Lehmann [13] used nonlocal bars to study the transverse vibrations of carbon nanotubes. On the other hand shells have gained comparatively more attention than bars. Ru [14] studied the infinitesimal buckling of a double-walled carbon nanotube and using simple elastic shell model for the same. Ru et al.

[15] further studied the application of simplified shell equations by taking Donnel model, a simplified Flugge model to observe its applicability and limitations. Ru et al. [16] used multipleelastic-shell model to study the vibrations of multiwall carbon nanotubes employing Flugge's equations. Ansari et al. [17] used the shell elements in a hybrid approach to model single walled carbon nanotubes and compared it atomistic method. Ghorbanpour Arani et al. [18] used Donnel shell model to measure the transverse displacements of single and double-walled carbon nanotubes, the results of which are compared with Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam models. They observed that beam models predict the lowest frequency and shell models predict the highest. Pantano et al. [19] also used shell elements to effectively model and study the deformation of single and multiwall carbon nanotubes. Wang [20] studied the buckling and free vibration of multiwall carbon nanotubes using multiple-elastic-shell model. Natsuki et al. [21] studied the vibrational characteristics of fluid filled double-walled carbon nanotubes using simplified Flugge shell equations as the governing equations. Tylikowski [22] studied the thermally induced vibrations using layered-shell model also taking into account the van der Waals forces. Eringen and Edelen [23], and Eringen [24,25] presented a theory, that takes into

consideration the strain states at all points of the body for a particular stress state, called the nonlocal continuum mechanics theory, containing information about the long range forces in atoms, along which internal length scale is introduced as a material parameter. This theory was proven to be applicable to nanoscale by Peddieson et al. [26], where they applied it to nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam model. Zhang et al. [27] developed the multiple-shell model, based on the nonlocal continuum mechanics, to study the axial buckling of multiwall carbon nanotubes. Wang and Wang [28] presented the constitutive relation for small scale effects for Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams and for cylindrical shell problems. Hu et al. [29] investigated the transverse and torsional wave in single walled and double-walled carbon nanotubes modeled as nonlocal single and multiwall elastic shells. Wang and Varadan [30] used nonlocal elastic shell theory to study the wave propagation analysis of carbon nanotubes. Khademolhosseini et al. [31] studied the torsional buckling using nonlocal elasticity shell models. Khademolhosseini et al. [32] also studied the size effects in dynamic torsional response of single walled carbon nanotube by modelling it as a modified nonlocal continuum shell. Mikhasev [33] studied the vibrations of

4

single walled carbon nanotubes embedded in nonhomogeneous elastic matrix using nonlocal continuum shell model. Recently Ansari et al. [34] investigated the free vibration characteristics of single and double-walled carbon nanotubes using nonlocal elastic shell model. Deng and Yang [35] studied vibration of fluid filled multiwall carbon nanotubes using nonlocal Flugge shell model. A rare approach of three dimensional vibrational and bending analysis was performed by Shaban and Alibeigloo [36] by taking nonlocal shell model to account for the size effect. The continuum beam model has also been of considerable interest to study the dynamic properties of carbon nanotube. Ru [37] used the multiple column model to study its buckling and Ru et al. [38] used the classical Euler-Bernoulli beams for single wall and multiwall carbon nanotubes and studied their vibrations. Both these studies gave ample attention to interaction between the tubes which was represented using van der Waals forces. Yoon [39], in his doctoral thesis, did an extensive study on the use of beams for single wall and multiwall carbon nanotubes, using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams. He used analytical formulas to obtain the natural frequencies and to study wave propagation. Fu et al. [40] studied the nonlinear free vibration of multiwall carbon nanotubes embedded in an elastic medium using multiple elastic beam model. A similar study was performed by Yoon and Mioduchowski [41]. Natsuki et al. [42] studied the vibrational characteristics of a simply supported carbon nanotube based on Euler-Bernoulli beam. Natsuki et al. [43] also studied the vibration of double-walled carbon nanotubes, embedded in elastic medium and double-walled carbon nanotubes with different lengths for inner and outer nanotubes [44]. Wang et al. [45] used Timoshenko beam model to account for transverse shear and rotary inertia of multiwall carbon nanotubes. Wang et al. [46] and Shima [47] reviewed the buckling of carbon nanotubes. Ansari and Hemmatnezhad [48] studied the nonlinear vibrations of multiwall carbon nanotubes embedded in an elastic medium using variational iteration method (VIM). A similar study was performed by Sadri et al. [49] with the surrounding medium being modeled as Winkler type model. Cigeroglu and Samandari [50] employed differential quadrature method to perform yet another similar study. Ambrosini and Borbon [51] studied the influence of van der Waals interaction coefficient on the vibrations of double-walled carbon nanotubes using higher order beam model. Ansari and Hemmatnezhad [52] studied the vibrations of double-walled carbon nanotubes using nonlinear finite element analysis, where Von-Kamran type nonlinear strain-displacement relationships were employed to

5

constraint the ends of carbon nanotubes to move axially. Baroudi and Razafimahery [53] studied the effects of an added mass on the natural frequency of clamped-clamped Euler-Bernoulli beam based carbon nanotube submerged in a fluid media. Vibrations of carbon nanotube-based composites were studied by Formica et al. [54] by employing a continuum model based on Eshelby­Mori­Tanaka approach. Adali [55] presented the variational principles for multiwall carbon nanotubes having nonlinear vibrations by considering the nonlinear geometric and physical effects arising due to large deflections and van der Waals forces between the tubes. Nonlocal beam models have also been studied extensively in the recent years. Zhang et al. [56] studied the transverse vibrations of the double-walled carbon nanotubes using nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam model, for the first time. Tylikowski [57] studied instability of thermal vibrations of the single walled carbon nanotubes embedded in viscoelastic matrix under timedependent temperature field using nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Ansari and Hemmatnezhad [58] studied the vibration of embedded double-walled carbon nanotube modeled as nonlocal Timoshenko beam using energy equation approach and finite element method. A similar study was conducted by Shakouri et al. [59], considering nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli and using the Galerkin-type finite element methods. An early comparison between both these nonlocal approaches was performed by Wang [60]. Reddy [61] reformulated all the available beam theories using nonlocal relations and gave analytical solutions for bending, buckling and vibrations for each case. Ponnusamy and Amuthalakshmi [62] studied the vibrational characteristics of viscous fluid conveying double-walled carbon nanotube for clamped-clamped and clamped-free conditions. Wang and Wang [63] used nonlocal Timoshenko beam theory to study the vibration of carbon nanotubes embedded in elastic medium. The current study considers carbon nanotubes to be Euler-Bernoulli beams, as local or crosssectional deformations (better studied using shell models), are not observed. Also, the high aspect ratio of the CNTs allow them to be reasonably represented as beams. To the best of author's knowledge, detailed Finite element formulations for double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes, using Galerkin weighted residual approach, for local and nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam, has not been explicitly reported in the open literature. The use of this approach is important for the current study, as an extension of this thesis would aim to exploit the same principle to develop a Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) [64­73] which combines the generality of
6

finite element method with the accuracy of Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM). Dynamic Stiffness Method (DSM), as mentioned in the earlier section, combines the coupled equations into a single equation, the closed form solution of which gives the displacement and force matrices, which are then exploited to achieve dynamic stiffness matrix, to which the system's boundary conditions are applied. A brief yet simple explanation of the DSM formulation is given by Banerjee in reference [74]. This method has been used extensively due to the exactness it offers. Some of these studies include the free vibration of coupled bending-torsion Timoshenko beam element [75], coupled bending-torsion axially loaded Timoshenko beam element [76], twisted Timoshenko beam [77], composite Timoshenko beam [78], axially loaded composite Timoshenko beam [79], bending-torsion coupled beam with warping [80], twisted beam [81], sandwich beams [82], tapered beam [83], elastically connected three beam system [84] and axially loaded double beam system [85]. More recently, dynamic stiffness matrix for a general plate has also been formulated and presented by Banerjee et al. [86]. All these formulations use Wittrick-Williams (W-W) root counting algorithm [87] to find the number of roots below a chosen frequency and exploit a suitable (e.g., bisection) method to arrive at the system's targeted natural frequency. This thesis presents a Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) formulation, developed and used to find the natural frequencies of carbon nanotubes, for the first time.

1.4 Objective The objective of this research is to study the free vibration characteristics of double-walled and triple-walled carbon nanotubes using analytical and approximate methods, considering them to be continuum structures, thereby preparing a foundation for vibrational study of complex structures that employ carbon nanotubes.

1.5 Scope of Research This research is intended to develop the FEM formulations for the free vibration analysis of double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), considering them as Euler-Bernoulli beams, using Galerkin weighted residual approach. This is presented for two cases, with and without an

elastic medium surrounding the carbon nanotubes. This simple but important step prepares foundation for the development of dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM), which is formulated for double-walled carbon nanotubes for both the cases. Finite element formulation is also presented for double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes based on nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam. This is also done for both cases, with and without an elastic medium surrounding them. By comparing the results for different cases, the effect of van der Waals interaction coefficient is studied. Also, the natural frequencies obtained using different analytical and finite element methods are compared to study the convergence rate for carbon nanotubes. The detailed Finite element formulations for double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes, using Galerkin weighted residual approach, both for local and nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam, have been explicitly presented for the first time, and so has been the dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) for double-walled CNTs.

1.6 Organization of thesis The following chapters are arranged in such a way that a brief introduction to carbon nanotubes with history, properties, methods of synthesis, applications, in general, and for aerospace field in particular, are presented in Chapter 2. Chapters 3 and 5 present the conventional finite element method (FEM) formulation for double and triple-walled carbon nanotubes using local Euler-Bernoulli beams, respectively, for both the cases with and without a surrounding elastic medium. The natural frequencies for these cases are found by solving the linear eigenvalue problem. The dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) formulation for double-walled carbon nanotubes is presented in Chapter 4. Williams-Wittrick (W-W) root counting algorithm, used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, is also briefly discussed. Chapter 6 presents the Galerkin weighted residual approach based finite element method for double and triple-walled carbon nanotubes based on nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beams. Finally conclusions and the path for future work is presented in Chapter 7.

Carbon Nanotubes ­ A Brief Introduction

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) continue to be a topic of considerable research in different areas of applications. The unique geometry of CNTs has been a key factor that gives them the rare properties they possess. A few of these properties and applications that benefit from those properties are discussed below. A brief historical outlook is provided and a section is dedicated to the CNTs' applications in aerospace engineering.

2.1 History Carbon, in the graphitic form, was discovered in 1779 and in the form of diamond about 10 years later [88], having sp 2 and sp 3 bonding, respectively i.e., each carbon atom covalently bonded with 3 carbon atoms for graphite and with 4 carbon atoms for diamond. The following two centuries saw intensive study and application of carbon and was thought of a mature field until a new form of carbon was discovered. Although a good number of literature credits Iijima [89] with the discovery of carbon nanotubes, Boehm [90] mentioned that carbon nanotubes were observed much earlier than 1991, but in different structural form ("usually bent or coiled" [90]). They were reportedly discovered in 1952 by Radushekevich and Lukyanovich [91] and reported in Journal of Physical Chemistry, according to Boehm [90]. It was due to the geopolitical situation of the time that this discovery wasn't popular among researchers in the West. Later, in 1955, Hofer et al. studied the carbon deposits on iron, nickel and cobalt, which were in form of "filaments from 0.01µ to 0.2µ in diameter" [92] (as action of carbon monoxide). In the

following year, 1956, Richard Feynman opened researchers to the idea of "manipulating and controlling things on a small scale" in his now famous talk "Plenty of Room at the Bottom" [93] to American Physical Society. The following years saw the formation of graphitic whiskers [94], rolling over of graphite sheets, in a form now known as multiwall-carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [95]. Growth of carbon filaments in tubular, twisted and balloon forms [96], led to the use of the term `nano-technology' for the first time [97] and its popularization through the 1980s [98]. Growth of hollow carbon fiber with large diameter in the direction of fiber axis was observed and reported by Oberlin et al. [99]. Research in carbon was invigorated with the discovery of fullerenes in 1985, which are closed cage-like structures of carbon with 60, 70 or 80 molecules

9

Iijima [89], while studying 60 in transmission electron microscope (TEM), discovered unusually tubular geometry of carbon molecules in carbon soot, later christened as carbon nanotubes. Iijima reported that these tubes have multiple graphitic sheets, ranging from 2 to 50, arranged coaxially, like Russian dolls, thus indicating that these were MWCNTs. Subsequently, Ebbessen and Ajayan [101] found efficient methods to make MWCNTs in gram quantities, using a variation of arc-discharge technique. It was in 1993 that Iijima and Ichihashi [102], and Bethune et al. [103], independently, found an efficient way of synthesizing single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The following decades saw a surge in the volume of research dedicated to this field of nanotechnology, studying their exceptional properties arising due to its high length to diameter ratio and exploring their applications in a variety of fields, including but not limited to, micro-electronics, energy, mechanical, and biological applications.

arranged in symmetry to form 60 , 70 and 80 as polygons [100]. It was later in 1990 that

2.2 Structure A carbon nanotube is simply a graphite sheet rolled into a cylinder having very small diameter, in nanometer range, even as low as 0.4 nm [104], and lengths ranging from 10 nanometers to few centimeters, hence giving it high aspect ratio (length vs diameter). In case of a MWCNT, these are several nested cylinders with an interlayer spacing. These tubes exhibit a spiral conformation, called chirality, whose vector is given as = Ch ma1 + na2 where a1 and a2 are unit vectors in two-dimensional hexagonal lattice and the integer pair (m, n) represents the translation indices. Taking these indices, the diameter of a single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is given by:

d=

where  is the angle of chirality i.e., the angle between Ch and a1 as shown in Figure 1 [46]. There are three cases depending on the chirality: i) ii) iii) zig-zag configuration -  = 0 and either m or n = 0 ; chiral configuration - 0° <  < 30° and m > n ; armchair configuration -  = 30° and m = n ;

For a MWCNT, two or more graphite sheets are rolled with different chirality angles [89,3,105]. For example, if the innermost nanotube is of zig-zag configuration, the rest are usually not. The interlayer spacing in MWCNT is close to the spacing for graphitic layers of 0.335nm and is generally taken as 0.34nm [88,105,106]. The interaction between individual SWCNTs in a MWCNTs is via van der Waals (vdW) forces [106,108].

Figure 1b ­ Armchair, zig-zag and chiral configuration of carbon nanotube (L-R) [46] 2.3 Synthesis Carbon nanotubes are mostly synthesized using three methods: Arc-discharge [109,110], laser ablation [111,112], and chemical vapor deposition [113,114]. 2.3.1 Arc Discharge Method: Iijima [89] was using this method when carbon nanotubes were

discovered in the carbon soot. This method involves the vaporization of carbon, under an inert gas in presence of a catalyst, which then condenses on the walls of the vessel and on the cathode. SWCNTs and MWCNTs are formed by adjusting the catalyst and pressure and are found on the cathode. This method is the widely popular as it gives the best quality carbon nanotubes. 2.3.2 Laser Ablation Method: Smalley et al. [111] used this method for the first time, in

which the carbon nanotubes were in the soot on the cold end of the furnace which had a laser impinging on a graphite target. This method can only produce SWCNTs of controllable diameter.

12

2.3.3

Chemical Vapor Deposition: This method involves a substrate coated with catalyst

particles. This step guides the diameter of the carbon nanotubes, as it is dependent on the size of the clusters of catalyst particles on the substrate. The next step would involve a carboncontaining gas being carried in the reactor zone, which would decompose the carbon rich gas and carbon nanotubes are formed on the surface of the catalyst particle. Although this method doesn't give the best quality, it can be scaled up for production of large volumes of carbon nanotubes [115]. Schematic diagrams for above-mentioned methods can be found in Liu [116]. Apart from these, a few methods like spray pyrolysis [117-120] are also used. While the demand for carbon nanotubes is expected to rise to more than 153,000 tons by 2020 [121], the challenges faced by the industry for production include slow production rate, poor yield, inconsistency in material quality, no control over the production process and limited structural enhancements in bulk carbon nanotubes [122]. It is to be noted that manufacturing MWCNTs is much easier than SWCNTs, as indicated by the large quantities produced today [123].

2.4 Properties The small size, chirality, sp 2 bond between carbon-carbon atoms, high aspect ratios and large surface areas are some of the major reasons for carbon nanotubes to have exceptional properties. For instance, their mechanical strength is 100 times more than that of steel at 1/6th of weight. Some of the mechanical, electronic and thermal properties are briefly discussed below. 2.4.1 Mechanical Properties: The sp 2 carbon-carbon bond, in a carbon nanotube, means that

each carbon is bonded with three other carbons and this gives unmatchable mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are considered as structural members to find the elastic properties of a carbon nanotubes, both as SWCNT and a MWCNT. Treacy et al. [124] considered carbon nanotubes to be a clamped cylinder and found the average Young's modulus of a MWCNT to be 1.8 TPa. They analyzed the thermal vibration by TEM. Kazumaki et al. [125] performed an in-situ observation of the deformation of a CNT and report that it undergoes elastic deformation to a certain critical curvature point after which the atomic bonding
13

changes to a diamond like state. A similar in-situ TEM study was performed by Wang et al. [126] to study electrical, mechanical, and field emission properties of carbon nanotubes. Wong et al. [127] considered CNTs to be a cantilever nanobeam and found the Young's modulus to be 660 GPa for SWCNT, and 1.28±0.59 TPa for MWCNTs. Similar studies were conducted by Krishnan et al. [128], Salvetat et al. [129, 130], Poncharal et al. [131], Lourie et al. [132] and it was found that the Young's modulus is always above 1 TPa. Salvetat et al. [130] reported that the elastic properties of the carbon nanotubes are rarely affected by the presence of point defects. Li et al. [133] extrapolated the tensile strength of SWCNTs bundles from the mini-composite and reported it to be in the range of 2.3±0.2 to 14.2±1.4 GPa. The tensile strength of individual carbon nanotube is reported to be as high as 22.2±0.2 GPa. Wei et al. [134] used molecular dynamics simulation and report the tensile strength of SWCNTs ropes and MWCNTs to be around 40-50 GPa. Yu et al. [132] recorded the tensile strengths of individual MWCNTs in the range of 11 to 63 GPa for 19 MWCNTs. They also reported the "sword in sheath" failure i.e., the outermost layer broke in MWCNTs exhibiting the given tensile strength. Buongiorno et al. [135] reported that for carbon nanotubes deformation larger than 5%, the system uses reversible formation of topological defects, releasing the excess strain. Belytschko et al. [136] reported the failure stress to be in the range of 93.5 to 112 GPa, and that carbon nanotubes undergo brittle failure and their chirality has a moderate effect on their strength. Yakobson et al. [137] studied the nanotube behavior at high tensile strain and reported extremely large breaking strain which reduces with the increase in temperature and has little influence of the carbon nanotube helicity. One of the in-depth reviews of the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, has been performed by Shokrieh and Rafiee [138] and aspects requiring further attention has been identified. 2.4.2 Electronic Properties: Carbon nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconducting

depending on a lot of geometric differences such as chirality factor and diameter [139,140]. Ebbesen et al. [141] studied the electrical conductivity of MWCNTs by considering four probe measurements. They report that both metallic and non-metallic behavior are observed, in different tubes of the same MWCNT, along with sudden increase in the conductivity as temperature is increased. Tans et al. [142] reported that SWCNTs act as quantum wires based on the electrical transport measurements, whereas Delaney et al. [143] reported that MWCNTs have

14

diffusive properties due to the presence of intertube interaction. Li et al. [144] studied the transport properties of 0.4 cm long carbon nanotubes and reported that they can be used in circuits as the transport properties are extensible even on cm scale lengths for nanotubes. Plombon et al. [145] studied the kinetic inductance of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes and high-frequency impedance of carbon nanotubes bundles and report that inductance of the bundle is scaled with the number of individual nanotubes. Cha et al. [146] prepared a bulk of randomly oriented carbon nanotubes and crosslinked them with each other through chemical reactions. They reported that the electric conductivity is increased by at least one order due to presence of crosslinks acting as bridges with low activation energy. Nihei et al. [147] studied the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes as interconnects between copper wiring. They observed that the electrical resistance of the interconnect having about 1000 carbon nanotubes was at least three orders of magnitude less than that of one carbon nanotube. The electrical conductivity of SWCNT reinforced polyimide composites was studied, as a function of concentration of SWCNT, by Ounaies et al. [148]. They reported that concentration of SWCNT can be customized for the required conductivity of the magnitude. 2.4.3 Thermal Properties: The rolling of a graphite sheet, as is done for carbon nanotubes,

reduces the 2 dimensional phonon structure into 1 dimensional which gives it thermal properties that need attention. Ruoff et al. [149] had suggested that the thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes would be higher than any known material. Che et al. [150] studied it using molecular dynamics approach for SWCNTs and made a similar observation. Hone et al. [151] reported that thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes in bulk, such as aligned SWCNTs, is greater than 200 W/m K, which is much higher than that of diamond or graphite. A similar study for individual MWCNTs was performed by Kim et al. [152] who observed the thermal conductivity to be 3000 W/K. Both these studies reported the values at room temperature. The thermal conductance of 2.76 µm long, single-walled CNTs, suspended individually, was studied by Yu et al. [153]. They observed that free path for phonons is an important factor that decides the thermal conductivity. Chang et al. [154] proved that Fourier's law of thermal conductance is violated for carbon nanotubes, which would mean that the phonons in the carbon nanotubes don't scatter even when the length of the nanotube is exceeded considerably thereby giving "extraordinary" thermal transport properties. Pop et al. [155] presented a method of finding the thermal conductivity of

15

SWCNT from high-bias electrical measurements thus relating the temperature on thermal conductance.

2.5 Applications The remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes provide considerable opportunities for their usage in multitude of applications. This might be attributed to the ever increasing demand of multifunctional, efficient materials at reasonable costs. De Volder et al. [156] reported that the current carbon nanotube production exceeded several thousand tons annually and pegged the number close to 4.6 kiloton/year. These production capacities indicate the commercial interest in carbon nanotubes to be used in various applications including, but are not limited to, composites [157,158] as fillers, as sensors in nanomechanical applications [159,160], as biosensors [161,162] to detect biomolecules, as gas sensors [163], as nanocarriers for drugs [164], in carbohydrate conjugation [165], to manipulate genes in genetic engineering [166], as nanofillers in dental applications [104], in tracking of cells and delivering transfection agents in tissue engineering [167-168], in repair of tissue after brain damage in neurogeneration [169], in diagnostic tools for biomedical applications [170,171], as conductive improver in Lithium-ion batteries [172], in production of new composite materials by nanocoating [173], as nanoprobes in electromechanical applications [123], as actuators [174], as interconnects [175,176], and as electron sources [177]. Aerospace industry has always been on the lookout for lighter and stronger materials that can bear extreme mechanical and thermal conditions. Carbon nanotubes, with their properties fit the description quite well. Nanocomposites are one area where the CNTs are mostly employed in aerospace industry. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had released a roadmap for the application of nanotechnology in aerospace industry in the year 2010 [178]. It had detailed the areas of Materials, Energy Generation and Storage, Propulsion and Electronics, as the major fields where nanotechnology can make a difference. This comprehensive document had detailed the applications in each of these areas and presented challenges faced by each area with the possible solutions in a timeframe. Simonis et al. [179] in 2006, presented the lightweight materials, safety, intelligence-guidance, protection, low energy, high-speed and

16

adaptive structures, as major areas in aeronautics, where nanotechnology has a potential. It has also listed the potential areas, where nanotechnology can be used in satellites. Gibson [180], in his review on the recent research of multifunctional materials, showed that the addition of CNTs to the composite materials increases their multifunctionality. Donnel et al. [181,182] studied the impact of CNTs on the commercial heavy aircraft. Zhao et al. [183] studied the usage of carbon nanotubes in composite film for de-icing. Self-sensing is an important factor from the point of view of morphing structures. Chung [184] reviewed the self-sensing of damage in carbon fiber polymer-matrix composites by measuring the electrical resistance. The usage of CNTs has also been explored for space elevator, a system designed for space travel, a major component of which is a cable that extends from earth to space. Carbon nanotubes are considered to be the material which form the ribbon, as their light weight will not let it buckle under its own weight. Laubscher [185] stated that woven carbon nanotubes based composite fibers form an important sub-system in space elevator. Cohen et al. [186] studied the oscillations of space elevator ribbon and gave mathematical formulations to find the static deformation and elastic oscillations. Pugno [187] studied the strength of carbon nanotube-based space elevator cable and concluded that the actual strength of the cable would be reduced by ~70% of theoretical estimation due to presence of defects. Pugno et al. [188] studied the stability of the track of space elevator and concluded that the track in itself is orbitally unstable, but attaching an adequately heavy satellite can stabilize it. CNTs are also used in aircraft wiring [189], propulsion [190], lightening protection [191] and stealth aircraft designs [192]. It is believed that even after finding so many

applications of carbon nanotubes, in aerospace and elsewhere, their true potential has not been realized yet.

Finite Element Formulation ­ Double-walled Carbon Nanotubes

3.1 Introduction Double-walled carbon nanotubes are the most common multiwall-carbon nanotubes used. The present continuum approach uses local Euler-Bernoulli beam to represent individual carbon nanotube, which are coupled through the van der Waals forces. The following section gives the formulation using Galerkin weighted residual approach to form the mass and stiffness matrices. A schematic representation of DWCNTs is given in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1 ­ Schematic representation of DWCNT

3.2 Formulation As the elastic beam has been shown to represent the properties of a carbon nanotube efficiently, when the length of the tube is much larger than the diameter, the carbon nanotube is modeled as area and  is the bending rigidity of the beam, the governing differential equation takes the form [193]: Euler-Bernoulli beam.

The mathematical formulation to arrive at the

corresponding equation is presented in Appendix A1.

The time dependency in (3.5) and (3.6) is eliminated by considering simple harmonic motion and using the following transformations.

w1 ( x, t ) = W1eit

w2 ( x, t ) = W2 eit

These transformations are substituted in the governing equations, (3.5) and (3.6) to obtain:

The coupling between both beams is represented by the last terms in (3.11) and (3.12), the first beam has the van der Waal's interaction coefficient  with the transverse displacement of the beam 2, shown in (3.11) by 2 and same can be observed in (3.12). Taking the amplitude of displacements as W1 and W2 , the Galerkin weighted residual method is applied on both

equations with  W1 and  W2 as the weighting function, the integral form of (3.11) and (3.12) is developed as shown below.

The boundary terms in (3.15) and (3.16) vanish with the application of system boundary conditions, hence the strikethrough. The system is then discretized using a number (k) of 4-node and 2-DOF per node (one transverse displacement and one slope per node) such that

Hermite type polynomial approximations are used, as done in classical Euler-Bernoulli beam finite element development, for each carbon nanotube in (3.17) and (3.18). For a two-node, two-DOF per node element, the non-nodal displacement function is written as:
Wn ( x ) = 1 x x2 x3

where { } ( = 1,2) represents a column of unknown constant coefficients for inner and outer carbon nanotubes, respectively. The vector of nodal displacements for bending are given by:

3.3.1 DWCNT modeled as local Euler-Bernoulli beam

The natural frequencies for DWCNT with three different boundary conditions, namely, clamped-clamped (CC), clamped free (CF) and simply supported (SS), modeled as local EulerBernoulli beam, are tabulated in Tables 3.1. The natural frequencies computed in the present study, i.e., using finite element method (FEM), are found to be in agreement with the so-called exact results provided by Xu et al. [195], which were found by solving the coupled equations.
24

The convergence of natural frequencies reported in this study, was verified and arrived at by changing the number of elements gradually from one to a point where the relative error becomes constant. Table 3.1 also shows the percentage error between the FEM natural frequencies, exact values reported by Xu et al. [195], and two other approximate methods; i.e., results reported by Elishakoff et al. [196], obtained using Bubnov-Galerkin or Petrov-Galerkin methods. In the table, 1 denotes the first natural frequency of the system whereas 2 denotes the first noncoaxial natural frequency of the system. In the present study, the FEM natural frequencies are obtained using a 50-element mesh, although some cases may converge using a less refined mesh. It can be seen that the error percentage between the present study and the exact values provided by Xu et al. [195] is at most in the order of 10-2, hence showing high rate of convergence.

A comparison of nondimensionalized natural frequencies of individual tubes of a DWCNT, and of DWCNT by using a single beam model is presented in Table 3.2. The equivalent single beam

It can be seen from Table 3.2 that the nondimentionalized frequency of the inner tube of a local Euler-Bernoulli based beam, obtained, using (3.30), is always lower than that of the outer beam, owing to smaller geometry. The natural frequency obtained by the single beam model gives the smallest value for all the three boundary conditions surveyed. It is to be noted that the nondimentional natural frequency of the multi-walled carbon nanotube system would require the equivalent Young's modulus and moment of inertia and is not a part of this thesis. In finite element analysis (FEA), it is important that an optimum number of elements are considered for

obtaining a converged value. Any number of elements less than that particular number can undermine the natural frequency value and anything more could result in errors arising out of extensive mathematical manipulations. One way to check the convergence is by observing the error percentage. When the error percentage goes towards zero or stabilises, it is said that the value is converged, like the ones presented in Table 3.1. The graphs showing convergence are plotted below, Figures (3.2) ­ (3.4). The percentage error was computed with respect to the figures. The number of elements are increased to the point where the error percentage becomes stable signaling the convergence of natural frequency.

High convergence rates, like these are found throughout the thesis.

It can be seen that the first few mode shapes are coaxial and tend to be non-coaxial when mode number increases. It can be seen that as the mode shapes tend to be non-coaxial, the concentric nature of the multi-walled carbon nanotube is distorted. This is not possible physically as that would mean the inner tube tears the outer tube in order to vibrate. Though the governing equations of a continuum structure gives n ­ number of mode shapes, not all of them might be physically possible. The resonant frequencies are governed by the amplitude ratio of inner tube to outer given by [195]:

3.3.2 DWCNTs, modeled as local Euler-Bernoulli beam embedded in an elastic medium Composite structures have been spearheading the use of carbon nanotubes as fillers or fibers, dispersed uniformly or as clusters, to improve the properties of resulting structure. Hence, studying the behavior of carbon nanotubes embedded in an elastic medium gains importance. The natural frequencies of DWCNTs embedded in an elastic medium are shown in Table 3.4, where four cases are taken to represent the pressure exerted by the external medium on the CNT. The results are compared to the values given by Yoon et al. [41] to verify the accuracy and robustness of the present study. Yoon et al. [41] solved the governing equations for CNTs embedded in an elastic medium to obtain the natural frequencies. The four values of the spring constant, k, are assumed such that the ratio k c is much higher, much lower, comparatively close to unity and at unity itself. The results show that there is a close agreement with the values calculated by Yoon et al. [41] and the percentage error remains small, as shown in the Table 3.3. Finite element results considers 50 elements, except for the case of clamped free boundary condition which uses 40 elements, for sake of convergence i.e., the number of elements are increased to the point that the percentage error between them becomes zero or becomes stable. Figures (3.8)­(3.10) show the percentage error vs. number of benchmark using which the percentage error is calculated. It is observed from Table 3.3 that the stiffness of the material in which the carbon nanotube is embedded has an effect on the natural frequency of the carbon nanotube; i.e., if the elastic medium has the stiffness

elements, where the values given by Yoon et al. [41], for ratio k c = 0.0001, are used as

nanotube increases at least by one order for all the boundary conditions, as can be observed from

k  1 say, k c = 100, the natural frequency of the carbon

Table 3.3. It can also be seen that as the stiffness of the elastic medium reduces, the natural frequency decreases due to the fact that carbon nanotubes would then have a less stiff material to vibrate in. These observations are meant for the outer tube of DWCNT, as the inner tube will have van der Waals forces around them, and so the coaxial frequency of DWCNT for the case when k  1 , i.e., say k c = 0.0001, remains comparable whether or not the carbon nanotube is embedded in the elastic matrix.

3.4 Conclusion In this chapter, based on local Euler-Bernoulli beam, a finite element model was formulated for two cases of a double-walled carbon nanotube, embedded and not embedded in elastic medium. The natural frequencies obtained using this formulation are in excellent agreement with the socalled exact and other values reported in literature.

Dynamic Stiffness Matrix Formulation: Double-Walled Carbon Nanotubes

4.1 Introduction Dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) is formulated as a single, frequency-dependant, stiffness matrix by transforming the coupled governing equations as a single equation and finding a closed form solution for it. In this chapter, a DSM is formulated for double-walled carbon nanotubes, with and without surrounding elastic medium.

4.2 Formulation The dynamic stiffness matrix for double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) is derived using the same equations presented in Chapter 3 for finite element formulation (FEM), i.e., equations (3.5) and (3.6), duplicated here:

1 = E1 I1 w1'''' + 1 A1 w cw2 - cw1  '''' 2 = +  2 A2 w -cw2 - cw1 E2 I 2 w2

(4.1)

eliminating the time dependency, the following equations are obtained:

Considering simple harmonic motion and using the transformations (3.9) and (3.10), and

(4.2)

E1 I1W1'''' - m1 2W1 + cW1 - cW2 = 0  E2 I 2W2'''' - m2 2W2 + cW2 - cW1 = 0
  The c term in (4.4) follows the rule set using (3.7) and (3.8), i.e., c would mean
operator, D = d dx leads to:

c

for the case

(4.4)

(4.3)

of a DWCNT without elastic medium and would represent (c + k ) when the nanotubes are embedded in an elastic medium. Rewriting the above equations by introducing a differential

( E1 I1 D 4 - m1 2 + c)W1 - cW2 = 0

(4.5)

37

 ( E2 I 2 D 4 - m2 2 + c )W2 - cW1 = 0

Equations (4.5) and (4.6) are now combined to obtain an eighth order equation in terms of either 1 or 2 , written as:

(4.6)

(D

where  is either 1 or 2 and

 It is worth noting that (4.9) reduces to (4.9.1), when c = c , i.e., carbon nanotubes not embedded
in an elastic medium.

m1m2 4 - cw2 (m1 + m2 ) q= ( E1I1 )( E2 I 2 )

(4.9.1)

The solution of equation (4.7) is sought in the form of where j = 1, 2 . Equation (4.7) is now written as:

w j = Y j ( x)ei t

(4.10) (4.11)

( 2 + 2 p + q)Y = 0

with  = D 4 . This reduces the eighth order equation to a quadratic one, the roots of which are and  , defined below for two cases; Case 1: When q < 0 :

The eight roots of the polynomial equation are 4 real and 4 imaginary roots, written as:

It is worth mentioning that in both cases of DWCNTs (i.e., with and without the surrounding elastic medium), the roots and hence the solution remains the same. governing equation is then expressed as: Y = D1e

These expressions are now used to generate the dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM), by enforcing end conditions to both the displacements, (4.21) and (4.22), and loads, (4.23) and (4.24). For displacements: At  = 0: At  = :

Y1 = W1 ; Y2 = W2 ; T1 = 1 ; T2 =  2

Y3 = W1 ; Y4 = W2 ; T3 = 1 ; T4 =  2

For shear forces and bending moments: At  = 0:

The system's dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) is then obtained by relating the loads F with

F = K

where

(4.35) (4.36)

K = QH -1

is the required frequency-dependent, dynamic stiffness matrix for a system of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNT), presented for the first time in this thesis.

43

4.3 Wittrick-Williams Method The developed dynamic stiffness matrix (DSM) can now be used to find the natural frequencies of the DWCNTs modeled as local Euler-Bernoulli beam by solving the system's nonlinear eigenvalue problem written as:
  K ( )   {wn } = 0

where   K ( )   is dynamic stiffness matrix derived earlier. It is to be noticed that the dynamic

(4.37)

stiffness matrix is different from finite element method matrices, in the sense that the DSM represents both the stiffness and mass properties of the system embedded in a single frequencydependent one, and hence results in a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The use of a frequencydependent stiffness matrix ensures that none of the natural frequencies are missed. One of the most frequently used method to determine the natural frequencies, in this case, is the WittrickWilliams (W-W) algorithm [87,197], which uses a trial frequency and is based on Sturm sequence properties of a frequency-dependant stiffness matrix, is briefly explained here for completeness. The number of frequencies exceeded by the trial frequency is given by

J = J 0 + sgn { K }
where

J 0 represents the number of clamped-clamped natural frequency of all elements exceeded

(4.38)

by the trial frequency and is given by

J0 =  Jm
where
Jm = i - 1 i 1 - ( -1) sg { D}   2

(4.39) (4.40)

and
44

 *  i = int   ; sg { D} = 1 or sg { D} = 0 , depending on sign of D ; i.e., sg { D} = 1 , when D is  

positive and negative when D is negative. D is defined as:

D = 1 - cosh  cos 

The sgn { K } part in (4.38) represents the number of negative elements on the main diagonal of
K  ; i.e., K ( ) after upper triangulation is performed using Gauss elimination. It is to be noted

(4.41)

that no row interchanges are to be performed in Gauss elimination. Bisection method is used to speed up the convergence of natural frequencies. 4.4 Results and Discussion The `exact' natural frequencies of DWCNTs modeled based on local Euler-Bernoulli beams are given below. The initial values are taken as given in equation (3.29) 4.4.1 DWCNT modeled as local Euler-Bernoulli beams The natural frequencies of DWCNTs, modeled based on local Euler-Bernoulli beam, are presented in Table 4.1 and are compared with the exact values by Xu et al. [195] and with those obtained using FEM developed and reported earlier in Chapter 3 of this thesis document. It can be seen that the natural frequencies obtained using this method are in good agreement with the other methods. It is worth stating that DSM method is independent of number of elements and the resulting natural frequency is comparable to the natural frequency obtained using a 50element FEM model, hence justifying itself as `exact' method. It is to be noted that the `Error 1' in Tables 4.1 gives the error percentage with respect to the exact values given by Xu et al. [195] and `Error 2' is calculated with respect to the natural frequency obtained using finite element formulation.

4.4.2 DWCNTs modeled as local Euler-Bernoulli beam, embedded in an elastic medium The natural frequencies for DWCNT modeled as local Euler-Bernoulli beam embedded in an elastic medium are tabulated in Table 4.2. The natural frequencies obtained using the Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) are compared with those obtained using exact and finite element formulations and the differences are calculated. As can be seen from Table 4.2, the percentage error in this case is always less than 1%. Once again, the results achieved using a single element DSM model are comparable with those obtained using a mesh of around 50 conventional FEM elements.

4.5 Conclusion Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) formulation was developed and used to carry out the free vibration analysis of double-walled carbon nanotubes with and without surrounding elastic medium. The nonlinear eigenvalue problem obtained from the frequency-dependent stiffness matrix was solved using Wittrick-Williams (W-W) algorithm. The natural frequency results for different system's boundary conditions matched those obtained from the conventional FEM and values presented in literature.

Finite Element Formulation ­ Triple-Walled Carbon Nanotubes

5.1 Introduction Studying triple-walled carbon nanotubes offer a great insight into multiwall CNTs with number of walls greater than two. This case and relevant aspects have rarely been studied and most of the research works published in the open literature stops with the double-walled configurations. In this chapter, the conventional finite element formulation for the free vibration analysis of triplewalled carbon nanotubes, using Galerkin weighted residual approach, is developed and the corresponding frequency results are studied. Schematic figure for a TWCNT is given in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1 - Schematic representation of TWCNT

5.2 Formulation In what follows, triple-walled carbon nanotubes (TWCNTs) are also modeled as local EulerBernoulli beams with van der Waals forces providing the coupling between individual beams.

48

Using the equations (3.1) to (3.4) defined earlier, the governing equations for triple-walled carbon nanotubes are defined as [198]:

1 = E1 I1w1'''' + 1 A1w c1w2 - c1w1 2 = c2 w3 - c2 w2 - c1w2 + c1w1 E2 I 2 w2'''' +  2 A2 w 3 = ^2 w3 + c2 w2 -c E3 I 3 w3'''' + 3 A3 w

(5.1) (5.2) (5.3)

where the derivatives with respect to length of the beam and time are denoted by prime (`) and dot (.), respectively. The subscripts 1, 2, and 3 represent the inner, middle and outer carbon nanotubes, respectively. The term  in equation (5.3) follows equations (3.7) and (3.8), and can be considered for TWCNTs with and without the surrounding elastic medium. Elimination of time dependency in (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) is made by assuming simple harmonic motion and using the following transformations, similar to (3.9) and (3.10).

w1 ( x, t ) = W1eit

w2 ( x, t ) = W2 eit w3 ( x, t ) = W3eit

(5.4) (5.5) (5.6)

where the transverse displacements of inner, middle and outer tubes, respectively, are

represented by 1 , 2 and 3 , whereas  and  stand for the circular frequency and time. Using these transformations in governing equations (5.1) ­ (5.3) leads to the following form of the governing equations:
E1 I1W1'''' + ( c1 - 1 A1 2 ) W1 - c1W2 = 0 E2 I 2W '''' + ( c1 + c2 -  2 A2 2 ) W2 - c2W3 - c1W2 = 0 ^2 - 3 A3 2 ) W3 - c2W2 = E3 I 3W '''' + ( c 0

(5.7) (5.8)

(5.9)

49

As can be seen from the above equations, both the inner and outer tubes are coupled with the middle one, as represented by the last terms in (5.7) and (5.9). Further, the middle tube has two coupling terms as it is coupled with both the inner and outer tube, as seen in equation (5.8). Representing   (j=1,2,3) as the amplitude of displacements, and W1,2,3 as the weighting

functions on the sets of equations, as Galerkin weighted residual method suggests, the integral form of (5.7) ­ (5.9) is developed as shown below.

For each carbon nanotube represented in equations (5.16) ­ (5.18), Hermite type polynomial

approximations are used to express approximate lateral displacements in terms of nodal values.

The stiffness, mass, semi-mass and coupling matrices are similar to ones represented in equation (3.24). For a 2 DOF per node element, one follows the expressions (3.19) ­ (3.23) to obtain the uncoupled matrices for triple-walled carbon nanotubes given by equations (5.19) - (5.21).  12 E1 I1  l3           6lE1 I1 l3 4l 2 E1 I1 l3 Sym -12 E1 I1 l3 -6lE1 I1 l3 12 E1 I1 l3  156m1l 6lE1 I1   3  l  420  2 w 2l E1 I1   11     l 3   11    + -6lE1 I1   w12   l3        12   2 4l E1 I1     3 l   22l 2 m1 420 4l 3 m1 420 Sym 54m1l 420 13l 2 m1 420 156m1l 420 -13l 2 m1   420  -3l 3 m1   w11      420    11  2 -22l m1   w12  420   12    4l 3 m1   420

The elemental stiffness and mass matrices of the TWCNT are represented as [ ] and [] , respectively, and have been presented in Appendix II. The linear eigenvalue problem, represented by (5.22) below, is obtained by assembling the element matrices and enforcing the system's boundary conditions, and is solved using a MATLAB® code.

(5.23)

The natural frequencies of TWCNTs for three different boundary conditions are given in Table 5.1. This study uses the Finite Element Method (FEM). The convergence is studied by

increasing the number of elements and plotting the error percentage either going to zero or becoming stable. As far as the author's knowledge goes, there are no exact methods present for validation of the natural frequencies of TWCNTs and so this study compared the first natural frequency of the DWCNTs, found earlier in Chapter 3. The ratio of natural frequency of TWCNTs to that of DWCNTs was found to be constant for all boundary conditions, hence validating the formulation of TWCNTs. Even though the convergence is achieved for a courser mesh, this study considers the natural frequencies for 30-element model. The figures following the Table 5.1 graph the convergence plot between the number of elements and error percentage for the three beams of the TWCNTs, with all the boundary conditions. Table 5.2 compares the nondimentional natural frequencies of individual tubes of TWCNT, with those of TWCNT, obtained using the single beam model, as explained by Equation (3.29), which involves summing up of the geometric and material properties of individual tubes and representing them as I , A and E respectively, as considered by Yoon et al. [41]. The nondimentional natural frequencies are obtained using (3.30) given in Chapter 3.

In addition to / = 1 ratio, three other values are taken to represent the effect of various stiffness values of surrounding medium on the vibration response of the TWCNT; i.e., the / is either  1,  1 or < 1. The natural frequencies are evaluated using a 30-element FEM graphed by taking the error percentages on the y-axis and number of elements on the x-axis. model and convergence plots are presented in Figures (5.8) ­ (5.10). The convergence plots are The figures following Table 5.3 are plotted to show the convergence of the natural frequencies presented in it. The graphs plot the variation of error percentage when the number of elements are increased from 5 to 30 with a step of 5 elements each. It can be seen that the values converge for 30 elements for all the boundary conditions.

5.4 Conclusion Finite element formulation was applied to triple-walled carbon nanotubes (TWCNTs), both with and without various (k/c) surrounding elastic medium matrix. The resulting linear eigenvalue problem is solved using a program code developed in MATLAB®. In addition, an investigation into the mode shapes for all the boundary conditions showed that they do not change with the stiffness of surrounding elastic medium matrix.

6 Nonlocal Finite Element Formulation
6.1 Introduction The nonlocal elasticity presented by Eringen [23] accounts for small scale effects by taking the stress at one point as a reference to be a function of strain at all points in the field. The small scale effect parameter for carbon nanotubes is presented in the terms of a constant value, which is a product of internal characteristic length represented as a , and a material specific constant value,

e0 . Zhang et al. [56] used the ratio of theoretical local result and experimental molecular
e0  0.82 . The characteristic length, a , is

mechanics simulation to arrive at a certain value of

taken to be 0.142nm i.e., the value of C-C bond length. The nonlocal parameter or small scale effect parameter is given as:

µ = e0 a
Hooke's law is modified using the theory of nonlocal elasticity, written as [61]:

(6.1)

 - (µ )2
where

 2 = E x 2

 is axial stress and  is the axial strain, written for small deflections as [56]

Using (6.2) and (6.3), along with shear and bending moment expressions for a beam, the following section. 6.2 Formulation

governing equation for a nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam is derived, as briefly discussed in the

The formulation of finite element model for nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam, along with that of a classical plate, have been presented by Phadikar and Pradhan [199]. This section will exploit the

63

same method to derive the mass and stiffness matrices for a single carbon nanotube modelled as a nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam. The FEM formulations will then be extended to nonlocal double- and tripled-walled CNTs, which, to the best of author's knowledge, have not been reported in the open literature. It can be seen from previous local CNTs finite element

formulations that the presence of coupling terms would not affect the mass matrix, but rather the stiffness. However, as it will be seen later in this chapter, the small scale effect factor only influences the mass matrix. The governing equation of a nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam, as reported in [200], is written as:

EI

where E is the Young's modulus, I is the cross-sectional 2nd area moment of inertia, mass per unit length (A),

nonlocal mass matrices, expression (6.12) has been modified to incorporate the small scale effects, appearing as a second matrix. Therefore, replacement of mass terms in both equations (3.24) and (3.25) with (6.12) would permit the local Euler-Bernoulli beam double-walled carbon nanotubes formulation to take the small scale effect into consideration, hence transforming into nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam double-walled carbon nanotubes.

6.3.1 DWCNT modeled as nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam

(6.16)

The natural frequencies of a double-walled CNT, modelled as nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam, for different end conditions are given in Table 6.1. The frequency values are compared with the exact values reported by Zhang et al. [56]. It can be seen that the values from the present FEM study are in excellent agreement with the exact values. As it can be observed in the figures following Table 6.1, the frequency values' convergence is practically achieved even using a course mesh of 10-20 elements, however, the convergence graphs shown in Figs. (6.1) - (6.3) have been produced for up to 50 FEM elements.

6.4 Conclusion In this chapter, finite element method (FEM) formulation was developed for the vibration analysis of double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes, with and without surrounding elastic medium of different stiffness values, modelled as nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam. The developed FEM was then applied illustrative DWCNT and TWCNT examples and the systems' natural
81

frequencies are found. The frequency data were then compared with the values available in the open literature, where applicable, and are found to be in agreement. It is worth noting that the error percentage between natural frequencies of local and nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beams is negligible, which can be attributed to the fact that this study considers the / ratio equal to 10 and is possible that the effect of nonlocal parameter on the natural frequency becomes more

published data in some cases, the convergence of frequency values have been established as a means of verification of correctness of formulation and results.

Conclusions and Future Work

Since their discovery, immense attention has been given to carbon nanotubes, due to their exceptional thermal, electronic and mechanical properties. The presented study in this thesis employs finite element method (FEM) formulation to study the free vibrations of double and triple walled carbon nanotubes, modelled as Euler-Bernoulli beams. The multiple-beam model employed assumes van der Waals forces acting as the coupling factor between the tubes. Galerkin weighted residual approach is used to derive the mass and stiffness matrices and the resulting linear eigenvalue problem is solved to extract the system's natural frequencies and mode shapes. The frequency results are compared to, and are found to be in agreement with, values reported in the open literature. An analytical formulation, known as the Dynamic

Stiffness Matrix (DSM), for the free vibration analysis of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) is also developed and presented for the first time. The DSM formulation revolves around the use of extensive mathematical and matrix operations carried out on the closed form solutions to a single higher- (eighth, in this case) order differential equation derived by combining the coupled (two fourth order, in this case) governing equations. The resulting Dynamic (frequency-dependent) stiffness matrix leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, which is then solved using Wittrick-Williams (W-W) root counting algorithm to find the system's natural frequencies and modes. Finite element formulation is also applied to the dynamic analysis of flexible carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modelled as nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beams, which takes into account the CC bond length to bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental field of carbon nanotubes. All the cases studied in the thesis also considered the case where carbon nanotubes are embedded in elastic medium, thereby paving way for the development of analytical and/or better numerical methods to study of CNT-based nanocomposites. The study confirms that both the numerical (FEM) and exact/analytical (DSM) methods, generally used for continuum structures, perform well and could also be exploited to further investigate and understand the vibrational behavior of CNTs.

83

Contributions of this thesis would include explicit FEM formulation of DWCNTs and TWCNTs using local and nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beams and DSM formulation of DWCNT using local Euler-Bernoulli beam. For future research, the exactness of the Dynamic Stiffness Matrix (DSM) can be combined with the generality of the finite element formulation using trigonometric shape functions, as suggested by Dynamic Finite Element (DFE) approach. Similar methods could also be employed to study the buckling loads for carbon nanotubes. Further, ropes and wires of carbon nanotubes can be studied by assuming the van der Waals forces acting uniformly between all the carbon nanotubes in the rope. Similar studies can be carried out using other continuum structures, with the aim of arriving at a model that could robustly account for all the parameters of the carbon nanotubes vibration, taking into account the chirality and other small scale effects. These studies could be further extended to two-dimensions so as to study graphene sheets. A comprehensive program could be developed that would snapshot the vibrational behavior of the carbon nanotube by assuming it as any continuum structure, based on the application it is to be used in, and the forces that would come into play.

A4 ­ Expression for clamped clamped natural frequency of DWCNTs The determinant of the K matrix obtained in (4.36) is found to be

D= -4   4 cos ( 1 4 ) cosh ( 1 4 ) + 4 cos (  1 4 ) cosh (  1 4 ) - 4 cos ( 1 4 ) cosh ( 1 4 ) cos (  1 4 ) cosh (  1 4 ) - 4

(

)

For the roots to be found, determinant of the matrix has to go to zero. (4.1) then is equated to zero and either
cos ( 1 4 ) cosh ( 1 4 ) - 1 = 0

(4.1)

or
cos (  1 4 ) cosh (  1 4 ) - 1 = 0

(4.2) (4.3)

Substituting

 = 0 or  = 0 satisfies (4.2) and (4.3)

 ,

2 =

c ( m1 + m2 ) m1m2

in (4.12) and (4.13) and using (4.8) and (4.9)/(4.9.1) gives (4.4)

which is the natural frequency for clamped clamped case of DWCNTs.

The equation can be reduced to a cubic equation by taking D 4 =

+ p 2 + q ) Y = 0

The roots of the cubic equation can be found by following the usual procedure. It is to be noted that the roots are to be of the form [real & imaginary], [real & complex] and [complex]. Any combination involving [real, imaginary & complex] can't deduce the dynamic stiffness matrix, to the best of author's knowledge. These roots seem to be elusive at the moment and would form the future research priorities for the author.
