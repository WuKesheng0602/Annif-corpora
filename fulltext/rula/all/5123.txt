A survey (n=17) of stakeholders' opinions found that brownfield redevelopment costs and complexity had increased since changes to environmental and planning regulatory frameworks were made. Existing financial incentives for brownfield redevelopment were reviewed in selected Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) municipalities. A pro forma analysis of a hypothetical mid-rise residential construction scenario was developed to test the current incentives against current market conditions (condo sale prices) in these municipalities, which were often not sufficient to make a project feasible in areas of low condo sale prices. A combination of incentives was found to be effective, and was recommended to be implemented by the Town of Whitby, which has many brownfields but no financial incentives.

Key Words: suburban brownfields; financial incentives; pro forma analysis.

Introduction
Changes in the Environmental and planning regulatory framework have made contaminated property brownfield redevelopment projects (in dense cities like Toronto) are aided by high property values, (brownfield) redevelopment more desirable to municipalities, but also more complicated. While urban suburban brownfields (in peripheral or lower-density municipalities) often do not have the same expected returns. Financial incentives are available for municipalities to encourage brownfield redevelopment, but they are not used uniformly in Ontario. This research attempted to answer the following questions: in light of recent changes to the Environmental and planning regulatory framework? lower market home prices?

feasibility analysis of a hypothetical brownfield mixed-use redevelopment project in several suburban vs. urban settings, given current market conditions, and the financial incentives available in these areas.

Context
This analysis forms part of a larger body of research, looking at the financial feasibility of brownfield redevelopment in suburban municipalities in Ontario, with a focus on the Town of Whitby, in the Regional an active port in the 1800s) and no current brownfields community improvement plan or associated incentives.

Changes in the Environmental and planning regulatory framework have made brownfield redevelopment more desirable to municipalities, but also more complicated. Part of this complication is the split focus between the Province, which focuses on environmental impact and regulatory compliance; and

municipalities, which see brownfield redevelopment as a primarily economic problem (Hayek et al, 2010). While urban brownfield redevelopment projects are aided by high property values, suburban brownfields often do not have the same expected returns (De Sousa, 2006 & 2009). Financial incentives are 1

Much of my research to date has focussed on the financial incentives used in Community Improvement 2010). This included an analysis of a vacant former gas station at 101 Victoria Street West in Whitby1.

Plans (CIPs) for brownfields, and their effect on individual project feasibility (De Sousa, 2000, Hayek et al This paper is intended to bring this research together to form a comparison of current incentives used in different municipalities, and their effects on the feasibility of a similar hypothetical project located within each municipality.

Scope
This research project will look at brownfield redevelopment in suburban vs. urban areas in Ontario, from a developer's perspective of financial feasibility, market factors, and financial incentives for brownfield redevelopment.

This research looked at stakeholder impressions of challenges to suburban brownfield redevelopment in southern Ontario, the relative financial feasibility of suburban vs. urban brownfield redevelopments, and the estimated cost (through incentives) to municipalities to make such developments feasible.    increased economic activity, environmental rehabilitation, or social benefits. This research did not attempt to quantify the benefits of brownfield redevelopment through This research did not attempt to look at exurban (i.e. outside of cities) brownfields.

In addition, this research did not attempt to look at varying brownfield sizes, contaminants, or remedial methods; this research will use a hypothetical (but common) brownfield scenario: abandoned retail fuel outlets at arterial intersections, with an area of approximately 0.2 hectares.

Benefit
In order to understand the degree to which CIP incentives may be required in order to attract private investment in brownfield redevelopment, it is important to understand local market conditions, especially land values and housing costs. It is hoped that this research will provide additional tools to suburban municipalities in order to understand the real vs. imagined challenges and barriers facing brownfield

redevelopment, and a better understanding of resources required in order to attract such development. It This research was done for Professor Steven Webber's Urban Investments course. Based on an assumed $100k to $1M brownfield liability, the project (redevelopment of a 0.4ha site into a high-rise condo/retail building based on an approved OPA designation for the site) would be financially unprofitable. Based on the pro forma analysis, Development Charge reductions or an aggressive Tax Increment Equivalent Grant would make the project feasible.

EVALUATING SUBURBAN BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES is also hoped that this research will benefit suburban brownfield remediation by contributing to research on the applicability of remediation incentives, as well as by providing additional tools to municipalities to help guide the creation or adjustment of these incentives. Pro Forma tools such as those used by De Sousa (2000) are useful in understand the feasibility gap of brownfield redevelopments in order to assess which incentives may make the project feasible with the least public cost. Some municipalities have demonstrated this concept through template or example pro adopted or adapted by municipalities to help them understand how their local market conditions can be augmented with specific incentives to achieve Community Improvement Plan objectives; furthermore, better bargaining position when it comes to negotiating incentives with the development community. Finally, the aim of this research is to recommend financial incentives to be implemented as part of a having an understanding of the particulars of a development scenario can help municipalities to have a

Literature Review
Much of the literature in this area deals with countries other than Canada. Where possible, Canadian sources were used, although only a limited number of studies were reviewed.

Brownfield Redevelopment - Overview
The benefits of brownfield redevelopment have been studied extensively elsewhere, and can include Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) discussed these possible benefits (NRTEE, 1998), and positive economic, social, and environmental outcomes. The now-defunct National Round Table on the advocated for a national strategy for redeveloping brownfields in Canada (NRTEE, 2003), and for

focusing less on the public cost of remediation and more on the potential gain from redevelopment

(NRTEE & CBN, 2005). However, brownfield redevelopment is also seen as "necessary but not sufficient" for local economic growth (Howland, 2007), and requires government investment, which may or may not (Metcalf et all, 2011). be recouped, depending on a variety of external factors such as real estate markets and economic trends Brownfield redevelopment is important to the planning practice as it requires different planning

Brownfield Redevelopment and Financial Feasibility
De Sousa (2000, 2002, 2006, 2006a, 2009) notes that much of the literature on brownfield redevelopment has focused on its technical aspects, and begins to fill this gap with studies of the private sector perspective on the costs and benefits of brownfield redevelopment. De Sousa (2000) used pro forma

financial analysis to demonstrate the relative profitability of urban brownfield vs. greenfield test cases, to show that brownfield redevelopment can nonetheless be more profitable than greenfield development in certain circumstances. In general, the private sector perceives the costs and liabilities associated with brownfield redevelopment to be a barrier to development, although certain uses (primarily residential in

Canada) are perceived as being profitable despite cleanup costs (De Sousa, 2000). The risk associated to accurately model subsurface contaminant behaviour can amplify a project's liability (Yu et al, 2012). 4

Municipal Financial Incentives for Brownfield Redevelopment
Although there are different views among Canadian municipalities regarding their role in dealing with financial risk associated with brownfield redevelopment. These tools, including Tax Incremental reducing the financial risk (De Sousa, 2000) associated with brownfield projects. Community brownfield redevelopment (De Sousa, 2006a), there are tools available to municipalities to reduce the Financing and development charge reductions, are perceived as effective by the private sector in Improvement Plans (CIPs) (s.28 of the Planning Act) have been used in Ontario since 1999, when

Hamilton became the first municipality to implement them (De Sousa, 2006a). Currently, most incentives for brownfield development are a form of municipal funding through Provincial enabling legislation, whereas incentives in the US are often funded through the federal government (De Sousa, 2002). Public funding for brownfield redevelopment can be seen as more socially acceptable than other social funding for addressing urban decay, specifically in the US (Greenberg, 2003). Opposing views contend that off-site investments like infrastructure and transportation may do more to the market value of the property (Meyer & Lyons, 2000). These investments may be integrated into brownfield redevelopment programs in order to approach the issue of feasibility from both sides (Amekudzi & Fomunung, 2004). Specific Incentives are discussed in more detail later in this paper.

Suburban Brownfields
Canadian municipalities in suburban areas generally give brownfields a lower priority than those in urban areas (De Sousa, 2006a). For the purpose of this research, suburban municipalities are defined as municipalities surrounding older central cities; Toronto is considered an urban municipality, with the surrounding Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) municipalities are considered suburban in relation to Toronto, by virtue of their smaller size, lower density, and the availability of greenfield land by two factors: increased availability of greenfield properties within city limits (ibid); as well as lower

within the municipal boundaries. The feasibility of remediating suburban brownfields is negatively affected property values and demand (and therefore profitability) than urban areas (ibid). While CIPs can make (Hayek et al, 2010), which make urban brownfields more attractive.

suburban brownfield developments more attractive to the private sector, they do not negate market forces Financial incentives are available for municipalities to encourage brownfield redevelopment, but they are not used uniformly by municipalities in Ontario (MAH, 2012). Specific municipal incentive packages are discussed in more detail later in this paper.

There has been a change in the brownfield regulatory process in Ontario since many of these reports 153/04 and O. Reg. 511/09, as amended).

The introduction of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe has placed new pressures on suburban municipalities in the area to redirect development to infill areas. In addition, new financial incentives are available to municipalities to encourage brownfield redevelopment.

Given these changes, a significant research gap exists in the understanding the current regulatory and the financial feasibility of suburban brownfield redevelopment.

financial challenges for brownfield development, and the effectiveness of financial incentives in improving Furthermore, Ontario is currently in the process of reviewing four provincial land use plans, including the Growth Plan and the Greenbelt Plan (MAH, 2015b), which may have implications for the types and amounts of incentives available to municipalities.

Methodology
In order to answer the proposed research questions, a mixed-method approach of qualitative and quantitative data gathering was used (Neuman & Robson, 2012). This consisted of the following: 1. Content analysis of available financial incentives for brownfield redevelopment; 2. Online surveys of stakeholder opinions and experience of brownfield redevelopment; 4. A financial (pro forma) analysis of hypothetical brownfield and greenfield scenarios.

3. Review of market factors (construction costs and home pricing) in case study municipalities; and Based on the research questions asked, the existing literature, and the resources available to me, the most appropriate method for completing the research was determined to be a combination of survey interviews of stakeholder opinions with a mix of qualitative and quantitative questions (for the first research question, which seeks to understand stakeholder opinions), and a quantitative analysis of third questions, which are evaluative and quantitative in nature).

Sample Size and Selection

The target sample size was approximately 10 respondents in each group (30 total), ideally with an

approximate 60%/40% split between respondents from suburban and urban areas. In all cases below, a combination of quota and snowball sampling was used to get a sufficient number of respondents which will have the appropriate experience (Neuman & Robson, 2012). Municipal planners were initially selected based on municipal staff directories on municipal websites. Private developers and Environmental consultants were selected from publicly available records of site conditions (RSCs) filed since 2011, members of the Canadian Brownfields Network (CBN) as of potential participants. November 23, 2015, open calls for participants posted on Facebook and LinkedIn, and referrals from Potential participants were contacted initially by email, based on an approved script. In total, the following number of potential respondents were contacted:    101 Environmental Professionals; and 82 Real Estate Development Professionals; 27 Municipal Planners or Planning Departments

Potential participants were asked to indicate their interest in completing an anonymous survey, which was approved by Ryerson University's Research Ethics Board. Referrals and respondents to the open call for participants were invited to contact the researcher to indicate their interest. Interested participants were

Survey Instrument

Stakeholders were given a short survey interview (less than 20 questions) in order to get their opinions of brownfield redevelopment. As indicated above, the survey was based heavily on De Sousa's survey research (2000), with a limited number of questions and additions for the suburban context.

Brownfield CIP Incentives and Application
Most incentives for brownfield development are a form of municipal funding through Provincial enabling legislation. This is unlike incentives in the US, which are often funded through the federal government (De Sousa, 2002), even though federal bodies like the former National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) have recommended a national framework for financial incentives for brownfield burden for brownfield redevelopment relative to their US counterparts.

EVALUATING SUBURBAN BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES Generally, incentives available under s. 28 of the Planning Act include grants or loans to pay for eligible costs defined under the CIP, which are set out in the Planning Act. For the purposes of brownfield redevelopment, eligible costs include Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) studies, remediation activities, and associated works.

Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) Study Grants

ESA Study Grants are grants applied against a portion of the cost of conducting ESAs and other environmental studies at the property. These are generally required under O.Reg.153/04 of the Environmental Protection Act when changing the use of a property to a more sensitive use, or when from under $10,000 to over $100,000, depending on the complexity of the property4. assumed to be during the first year of development, as an offset to "soft costs".

This confusion is increased by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing (MAH) describing the function of TIEGs in a webpage titled "Tax Increment-Based Financing" (MAH, 2015).

TIEGs are generally paid to the property owner after the rehabilitation of a property (remediation and

Other incentives exist which are not detailed in this study. Of note is the Green Municipal Fund

Municipalities with Brownfield CIPs
As of 2010, 44 municipalities in Ontario had CIPs with brownfield provisions (MAH, 2010). This study looked at Brownfield CIPs in Barrie, Guelph, Hamilton, Waterloo, Whitby, and Toronto.

One interesting aspect of Barrie's CIP is the identification of priority properties for redevelopment. While there does not seems to be additional incentives for these specific properties, this idea could be carried forward to other CIPs.

Guelph (2012)

Guelph's Brownfield Redevelopment Community Improvement Plan (2012) includes Environmental Study Grants, TAP/BFTIP tax cancellation, and TIEGs.

Municipal CIP Expenditures and Benefits - Windsor Case Study
The City of Windsor's Brownfield Redevelopment CIP (2015) has several incentives that make it different from the municipalities considered. Windsor offers funding for studies on the feasibility of rehabilitating brownfields (i.e. through the use of pro forma tools or similar methods), for 50% of the study up to a maximum of $7,500 per property. This is different from ESA Study Grants, which require property access and intrusive sampling of soil and groundwater.

Windsor also offers an Environmental Study Grant up to $25,000, a TAP / BFTIP, a TIEG for 70% (100% with LEED certification), and a 60% DC Exemption.

While this may seem at first to run afoul with the Planning Act sections on maximum amounts: "The total of the grants and loans made ... shall not exceed the eligible cost" (s. 28(7.3)), this may be interpreted as an expansion of the definition of eligible costs, which may also include costs related to "development, redevelopment, construction, and seen as a conforming use of CIP incentives. reconstruction of lands and buildings for rehabilitation purposes" (s. 28 (7.1)).

The City of Windsor is a good example of a city which uses CIPs to offset lower property values, and of a city with publicly accessible monitoring and publishing of CIP expenditures. Of special importance for this study is that Windsor provides a stand-alone grant for feasibility studies for brownfield properties. This allows for early studies of brownfield properties to determine the sensitivity of the development to liabilities associated with environmental contamination before needing to obtain the proper permissions and contractors to determine the level of contaminant impact at the site.

EVALUATING SUBURBAN BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES The perceived higher support of municipal government is not too surprising, as most brownfield redevelopment incentives are generally provided by municipalities. Among non-government organizations, lending institutions were perceived to have somewhat low support (average score of 3.25), while remediation companies had the highest perceived support 7 with an average score of 5.29.

Changing Regulatory Processes for Brownfields

Respondents were then asked to rate the effects of changing regulatory processes, specifically Records of Site Condition (RSCs) on various aspects of brownfield redevelopment.

As shown, a greater emphasis on brownfield redevelopment over greenfields (4.94) was felt, as well as a greater complexity of remediation (5.61); however, support from government (3.12), developers (3.59), and the public (3.88) were felt to have dropped.

This indicates that respondents felt that the Growth Plan, Greenbelt Plan, and other similar policies had increased emphasis on brownfield redevelopment, but that stakeholder support for brownfield redevelopment had not increased. This finding is concerning, as these stakeholders include government, who are behind the change in policy and should conceivably be trying to support the implementation of their own policy. These policies are currently under review, and the Advisory Panel has recognized that existing

environmental and land use legislation is seen as a hurdle by the development industry and an

It is understood that these estimates may require revision based on further information; therefore, these figures are highlighted in the pro forma analysis for easy revision.

It is assumed that approximately 50% of the property is considered contaminated, to an average depth of 8m, resulting in a remediation volume of approximately 8000 m 3 soil, and 1200 m3 groundwater. Environmental Site Assessment and site remediation (if needed) is therefore expected to cost approximately $1,230,000 and take 1 year.

Site location

The site is assumed to be located at the intersection of arterial roads, near to higher-order transit such as 400-series highways, with a mix of residential and commercial surrounding uses. In the case of Whitby, the base case for this pro forma is located near a GO station and on a corridor with proposed "mainstreet" style redevelopment plans.

Land Price

The land price for the site was based on the assessed value of a similar former retail fuel outlet at 651 Queenston Road in Hamilton. The Hamilton property was approximately 0.3 ha, and had an assessed value of $671,500 or $222/m2 with no structures remaining. This property was selected based on a visual review of aerial photographs for Hamilton from Google Maps, looking for properties at apparent arterial intersections which appeared to be abandoned former retail fuel outlets. As it is understood that this value will be different for different markets, an estimate of brownfield land prices in different markets was made by using the relationship between land price in this example ($222/m 2) and Hamilton's average condo sale price ($4,511.59/m 2, as indicated below). The resulting 31

EVALUATING SUBURBAN BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES value of 4.92% was then applied to condo sale prices in other markets to come up with an estimate of market differences in land values. Residual Land Value was also calculated to control for estimates in land price.

Proposed Development

The site is proposed to be developed as a multi-residential condominium apartment building, with a height of 4 storeys and approximately 90 units, of which approximately 60% are assumed to be single-bedroom proposed as a "build-and-sell" scenario, where most units are sold prior to construction, and the remaining units). units.

Construction Costs

Hard costs for the scenarios were taken from the Altus Construction Cost Guide for 2016 (Altus Group, including underground parking. Average costs were calculated at $190 psf for an 86,111 sf building, or the proposed scenario, and found to be within 10% of the Altus estimate. (Altus Group, 2016), and ranged from 99% to 115%.

This was checked against an example using RSMeans' Quickcost Estimator 9 for In addition, local construction cost variations were taken from the Altus Construction Cost Guide for 2016 For alternate building scenarios, Altus' costs for 4 storey wood-framed condo were used (Average of

$137.50 psf). No parking is included in this estimate; a level of underground parking would be an average of $100 psf (of building footprint, not GFA). Parking is determined in this scenario in accordance with Whitby By-Law #6925-14: 1.5 parking spaces are required per unit, and parking spaces must be 5.8m by 2.75m. An efficiency of 60% is estimated for parking structures, to account for laneways, ramps, posts, etc., giving a total parking garage area of approximately 39,000 sqft, with a cost of approximately $3.9 M. This is generally analogous to the Altus estimate of a 70:30 ratio of above-ground area to buried parking area. Construction is expected to take 2 years.

Toronto (Downtown)

As shown, Toronto's Condo market is significantly higher than the other municipalities considered, due to density, location, and market conditions not discussed in this report. This has the effect of allowing projects to still be profitable with much higher costs than surrounding municipalities.

Originally, both Brantford and Oshawa were included in this analysis. Both of these municipalities were excluded, however, based on not having available current condo development examples which were consistent with the scenario design.

Sale Revenue

Sale revenue was calculated based on 85% of units pre-sold at year 0, and the remainder of units sold after 2 years. The present value of this sale was used, minus carrying costs (i.e. property taxes) on unsold units for the 2 years. 33

Project Evaluation
The pro forma was then used to compare the project in different scenarios, to evaluate their financial feasibility.

Measures of Feasibility
Return on Equity (ROE)

The measures of feasibility used were Return on Equity and Residual Land Value

Return on Equity was calculated as the remaining money after project costs and equity are subtracted from sale revenue. This was then shown as a percentage of project equity.

Residual Land Value

Residual land value was calculated as the residual after project costs (minus land costs) and a preferred ROE of 20% was subtracted from project sale revenue. The residual land value represents the highest amount that the developer would be willing to pay for the percentage of equity as profit, the estimated residual land value would be higher,

Base Case Evaluation: 101 Victoria Street West, Whitby
Based on the above information, a base case was developed for the brownfield at 101 Victoria Street

West in Whitby. While there are risks with generalizing from a specific site, this site was chosen based on its commonplace history as an approximately 0.2 ha vacant former retail fuel outlet, and location on an intersection of arterial roads near higher-order transit and highways. It is proposed that sites similar to this one may be found in the target municipalities. Furthermore, details on revenues and costs relevant to the target municipalities was used where available, as detailed above. Based on Town of Whitby Report No. PL 45-11 (Town of Whitby, 2011), the property was previously occupied by a Texaco service station.

As shown, the greenfield scenario of the project has a low ROE (10%) and negative Residual Land Value at the target of 20% ROE. While the ROE is positive, the amount of profit would be well below the target ROE, so the project would be considered unfeasible. Since the ROE gap (Target ROE minus ROE) is greater than the land cost, the residual value of the property is considered to be negative; that is, the developer could not pay any land costs and still get the target return. In the Brownfield scenario, environmental costs as well as project delay are added to the project. As

EVALUATING SUBURBAN BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES In the case of Whitby, the ROE increases by 46%, and the project moves into positive ROE territory. An additional 16% ROE (approximately $800,000) would be required to make this project feasible with the current land costs. Options to increase the performance of this project could include waiving the

remaining costs on DCs (Total DC fee is $1.8 M, allowing an additional $700k to be added to the balance of the project) or by the developer changing the project configuration to reduce costs and increase value. It is noted that in this case, the Whitby project would be paying out incentives equal to roughly twice the environmental costs. These additional costs would need to be weighed against the benefits of the development. Were the environmental costs greater, greater grants could be given as TIEGs, or through

DC reductions. Conversely, limits on either of these grants could be raised to encourage projects like this.

Reducing Land Costs

The previous scenarios have included land costs for the development, based on the assessed value of a similar property. However, it is arguable that the previous owner should be financially responsible for the pollution on their property. Furthermore, property owners should not be incentivized to hold a vacant brownfield and prevent development while waiting for nearby property prices to rise in order to make a

higher profit. Depending on the case, municipalities may take possession of lands where property taxes are unpaid for 2 years. In these cases, (or by other means) a sale of the property could be arranged for $1. A pro forma of the development was run, given Windsor-style incentives and a sale price of $1.

As shown, in this scenario the reduction in land cost makes a significant impact on the project ROE (-33% at $1 land value vs. -43% at regular land value). After incentives, this scenario has an ROE of 14%, which is much closer to the target ROE of 20%. Transferring property at $1 should be considered to be an important and valuable incentive. Municipalities can do this in the case of tax sale properties, and may use other methods such as higher property taxes on vacant properties to discourage brownfield owners from trying to wait for a profitable deal on their properties.

Whitby CIP Incentives
Existing CIP Incentives

The Town of Whitby has a CIP for the downtown area, dated 2004. This CIP is primarily for small capital improvements to encourage restoration of historic architectural features, with associated small grants (less than $5k); there are no incentives specifically targeted at brownfield redevelopment (Whitby, 2004).

Durham Regional Revitalization Program (RRP)

The Region of Durham established the RPP in 2008 to provide matching funding to area municipalities for revitalization projects (Durham, 2015). This is funded through the Regional Revitalization Reserve Fund, which is reportedly replenished through increased assessment of approved CIP projects.

Criticisms of the RRP include the requirement of the lower-tier municipality to advocate for the proponent gap after local CIP incentives have been applied, and ongoing monitoring of the project by the lower-tier municipality. This can potentially put the lower-tier municipality in a conflict of interest, and demands additional public resources be used to secure assistance for private development. case of very large developments which are seen as a high local priority.

Whitby released a proposed Community Improvement Plan for the Port Whitby Secondary Plan Area in 2015; this was developed alongside a proposed official plan update for the secondary plan area, to incorporate Growth Plan objectives and the Port Whitby Sustainable Community Plan (PWSCP).

within the Community Improvement Project Area (CIPA), which includes other brownfields within the Port The Community Improvement Plan is targeted at a variety of development goals, but includes specific incentives for brownfield redevelopment, including the following:

Development Charge Reduction

The development charge grant would be equivalent to the eligible costs of assessment and cleanup, with no stated maximum. This incentive would apply to the proposed brownfield CIPA. It is noted that many limit the amount of the incentive. CIPs include a maximum on the development charge reduction, usually expressed as a percentage, to

The TAP incentive lasts a maximum of 3 years, and the TIEG stays at 100% of the tax increment for a maximum duration of 5 years from project completion 12. The TAP and TIEG incentives share a maximum project budget of $100,000 annually for all accepted $213,000 for this project.

This fund could eventually be used for additional efforts such as Municipal action (i.e. cancellation of tax arrears, ESAs, and/or remediation) on Tax Sale properties, in order to prepare them for development.

It is noted that the 2008 IBI report indicated that budgeting for TIEG, Planning Fee, and DC reduction this study, TIEG incentives are considered to be less costly to the Town of Whitby than are DC

Furthermore, they are a "pay-as-you-go" grant, where grant money is given only after the full taxes (including the tax increment) have been paid.

While this may be true, it can be argued that the services required in the projects, which would normally be funded through these fees, will require funds to be allocated from higher fees elsewhere or from a reduction in expenditures.

As shown, neither the 2008 recommended incentives nor the 2015 draft CIP for Port Whitby increase the ROE enough to make the project feasible with current assumptions, even though they both increase the ROE by 26%, and have the same resulting residual land value. This is because although the 2008 and 2015 incentives are different, they are both limited to the eligible costs of redevelopment, which is the 52

This research has shown that municipalities in Ontario use a variety of financial incentives for attracting strongly dependent on local market factors, specifically home sale prices. Other costs (construction, remediation, etc.) are generally consistent across markets; home sale prices are the strongest brownfield development. Furthermore, it has shown that the need for and benefit from these incentives is

determinant of whether a project is financially feasible. This was made plain by comparing the selected Based on available information, the scenario for Barrie was never feasible (ROE below -200%), with a loss of well beyond the environmental costs, while the scenario for Toronto was extremely profitable (ROE above 300%) for all scenarios.

Answering Research Questions
1. Have stakeholders' impressions of the profitability (feasibility) of brownfield development changed Based on the responses received, the following trends were identified:  in light of recent changes to the Environmental and planning regulatory framework?

Changes in the environmental regulatory framework have increased to complexity, cost, and time required for brownfield redevelopments, but have had little effect on liability concerns or public approval for redevelopment.



Changes in planning policy have increased emphasis on brownfield redevelopment from government and developer approval for brownfield redevelopment.

Urban brownfield redevelopments were thought to cost more and take longer than suburban brownfield redevelopments, but nonetheless be much more profitable than the suburban equivalent.

As shown, the changes in the regulatory and planning policies were generally perceived to have a

negative effect on the time required and cost of redevelopment, which would not increase the feasibility of suburban developments. This is consistent with the requirement for specific redevelopment incentives in suburban areas. Finally, municipal governments were perceived by respondents to be the most supportive of brownfield redevelopment. This is not surprising, as most brownfield redevelopment incentives are generally provided by municipalities.

The brownfield scenario used was profitable before incentives in both Hamilton and Waterloo, as well as Toronto (although by a much lower margin, with ROEs of 21% and 26% vs. 296%). So although it was much less feasible in (Barrie, Guelph, and Whitby), the scenario had an insufficient return in greenfield scenarios, and a negative return in brownfield scenario, due to lower market values. these areas, the scenario used would still have been profitable.

Are existing financial incentives for brownfield redevelopment sufficient to close the feasibility gap Based on the pro forma analysis, the existing financial incentives were able to increase the project's ROE by between 7% and 18%; however, none of the existing financial incentives were sufficient to make the in this analysis. The poor feasibility of this project in some areas, even without brownfield liabilities, is important because the Growth Plan (2006) directs municipalities in the Greater Golden Horseshoe (including all of the target municipalities, with some special provisions for Barrie) to accommodate proposed development feasible where it was not before. This is likely the result of the configuration used and make suburban brownfield redevelopment financially feasible?

Contribution to Research
The results of this analysis was compared against a selection of the research papers reviewed, in order to identify whether these results supported or differed from their findings. De Sousa, 2000 - Stakeholder Interviews and Pro Forma analysis This research supported De Sousa's research, which showed that remediation costs, lengthy timelines, and regulatory complexity were seen as important barriers to redevelopment. Moreover, this research showed that perceptions of these aspects of redevelopments had gotten worse since the time of De Sousa's research.

De Sousa's pro forma analysis was a detailed comparison of residential vs. industrial developments, in a greenfield vs. brownfield perspective. This research had a different focus, but supported his findings that variations in unit sale price ($ psf) has a strong effect on where a project is feasible or not, as well as his

findings that governmental tax incentives have a strong effect on reducing the private costs of brownfield remediation. Finally, De Sousa's analysis of the effects of different non-financial incentives, specifically a shortened development period, is supported by the findings of this research as the additional delay of the benefits of incentives (especially additional density, which results in additional hard costs and therefore higher carrying costs). De Sousa, 2006 - Surveys of Municipal stakeholders across Canada This research was not able to draw inferences about municipal opinions on brownfield redevelopment, due the low response rate from municipalities. However, this research does support De Sousa's conclusions about the perceptions of the roles of different levels of government; the federal government of support overall.

Implications for Whitby, Ontario (and similar municipalities)
The scenario for Whitby was not feasible as either a greenfield or brownfield development, and was only made feasible with modified construction materials and incentives greater than the total environmental municipal planners:  costs. This has several important implications for redevelopment and intensification which are relevant to The density and configuration of development is constrained by market forces. A stated goal for a certain type of development is unlikely to be fulfilled by the private sector without the necessary market forces, or the appropriate incentives to make it profitable.



If these development goals are considered vital to the municipality, achieving them would require public investment in private development until sale prices rise to allow the market to act alone.

Incentives like Windsor's, which allow "double-dipping" on eligibly environmental costs, were the

strongest incentive for enabling brownfield development. More significantly, they can enable a project to go forward with a built form or density which would not currently be feasible in that market, even on a greenfield site. This makes brownfield development more profitable than greenfield development, by allowing incentives above the total environmental remediation costs. While this represents additional

costs to the municipality, this also represents an opportunity for Whitby to turn brownfield properties into which implements OP goals.
