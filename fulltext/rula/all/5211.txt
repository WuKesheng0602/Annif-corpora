Catherine  Middleton  

What  I  will  talk  about  
· Digital  economy  strategies   · Canada's  digital  economy  
­ wired  broadband  networks   ­ mobile  phones  and  broadband   ­ extending  network  availability,  increasing  quality  

· Libraries  as  enablers  of  the  digital  economy

Digital  economy  strategies  

See the end of this PDF for links to all documents and data cited in the presentation.

3  

What  do  digital  strategies  do?  
· Set  targets  and  plan  for  roll  out  of  high  quality   broadband  infrastructure  
­ e.g.  all  Europeans  to  have  access  to  broadband   networks    30Mbps  by  2020  and  50%  of  EU   households  adop%ng  services  with  speeds  of   100Mbps  or  greater  by  2020   ­ 100  million  U.S.  homes  should  have  affordable   access  to  actual  download  speeds  of  at  least  100   Mbps  and  actual  upload  speeds  of  at  least  50   Mbps  by  2020

NaTonal  broadband  infrastructure  

5  

Encourage  digital  literacy  
· Foster  effecTve  use  of  the  internet,  encourage   socio-economic  benefit  from  access  to  online   data  and  services   · Individuals  and  businesses,     especially  SMEs  

6  

Define  service  delivery     in  a  digital  economy  
ObjecTves  include:   "Enabling  the   American  people  and   an  increasingly   mobile  workforce  to   access  high-quality   digital  government   informa%on  and   services  anywhere,   any%me,  on  any   device."  

"Digital  by  default  means  digital  services  which  are  so   straigh]orward  and  convenient  that  all  those  who   can  use  digital  services  will  choose  to  do  so,  while   those  who  can't  are  not  excluded"  

· Services  that  are  convenient  to  the  users  rather  than  the   providers;  high-quality,  responsive,  convenient  and  up-to-date.   · Average  cost  of  a  central  government  digital  transacTon  can   be  almost  20  Tmes  lower  than  the  cost  of  telephone  and  50   Tmes  lower  than  face  to  face,  also  saves  Tme/money  for  users  

Canada's  digital  economy*  
*with  a  focus  on  ciTzen  access  to,     and  parTcipaTon  in,  the  knowledge  economy  

Canada?

eGovernment  in  Canada?  
  "Canadians  rely  more  on  the  Internet  to   conduct  business,  and  they  expect  the   government  to  keep  pace  and  provide  them   with  online  informaTon  and  services  that   meet  their  needs,"  but:  
 "there  is  no  government-wide  service  delivery   strategy  and  that  there  has  been  no  overall   assessment  of  client  needs  and  saTsfacTon   since  2005"          Auditor  General  2013    no  menTon  of  mobile  in  audit  of  access  to  online   services  

Broadband  access  
· Federal  funding  for  Community  Access   Program  ended  March  2012   · Broadband  Canada  2009-2012   · "the  Commission  [CRTC]  establishes  target   speeds  of  5  megabits  per  second  (Mbps)   downstream  and  1  Mbps  upstream.  These   speeds  should  be  available  to  all  Canadians,   through  a  variety  of  technologies,  by  the  end   of  2015"  
12  

The  access  divide  in  Canada  
· As  of  2012,  100%  of  urban  Canadian   households  can  access  broadband  
­ 94%  access  to  speeds    5  Mbps   ­ 32%  access  to    100  Mbps  (limited  choice  of   provider)  

· 85%  of  rural  households  have  access  to   broadband  
­   5  Mbps  service  only  available  to  ~20%  of   households  with  fixed  wireless  or  satellite  service

What  about  libraries?  
· Enablers  of  the  digital  economy,  connecTng   people  to  knowledge   · Very  important  role  as  access  provider:  
­ Wi-Fi,  connected  computers,  e-readers,  tablets  

· Enormous  impact  in  increasing  digital  literacy,   ongoing  acTvity  that  provides  real  value  to   communiTes
