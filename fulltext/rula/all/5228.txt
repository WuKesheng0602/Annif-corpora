The  Next  Broadband  Challenge:   Mobile

Na>onal  Broadband  Plan  
· Goal  No.  2:  The  US  should  lead  the  world  in   mobile  innova>on,  with  the  fastest  and  most   extensive  wireless  networks  of  any  na>on.   · Ensure  universal  access  to  broadband  network   services:  
­ Create  a  Mobility  Fund  to  provide  targeted  funding  to   ensure  no  states  are  lagging  significantly  behind  the   na>onal  average  for  3G  wireless  coverage.  Such  3G   coverage  is  widely  expected  to  be  the  basis  for  the   future  footprint  of  4G  mobile  broadband  networks.

next  genera>on  broadband:   wire  vs  wireless  
· is  service  to  the  home  required?   · is  fibre  needed  to  do  it?   · is  wireless  a  disrup/ve  technology?   · what  do  broadband  users  want?  

Service  to  the  home  
· Some  services  well-suited  ­  e.g.  HD  TV,  large   screen  etc.   · In  home  health  care   · But:  1.  `beneficial  bb  services'  ­  ehealth,   elearning  delivered  outside  home   · 2.  Can  take  mobile  into  home  but  not  vice   versa  

Do  we  need  fiber?  
· Argument  goes  that  build  it  and  they  will   come,  we'll  figure  out  what  to  do  with  fibre   apps   · Just  need  a  killer  app   · Long  list  of  applica>ons,  but  is  this  really  what   will  develop?  

What  do  people  want?  
Australia:  40%  of  total  bb  subs  are  wireless   Denmark  ­  2011  mobile  bb  will  overtake  fixed   Austria  ­  mobile  considered  a  viable  subs>tute   38%  of  Americans  have  accessed  internet  from   a  mobile  device   · etc   · · · ·
