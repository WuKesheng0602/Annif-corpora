Abstract: Reduction of contour error is a very important issue for high precise contour tracking applications, and many control systems were proposed to deal with contour tracking problems for two/three axial translational motion systems. However, there is no research on cross-coupled contour tracking control for serial multi-DOF robot manipulators. In this paper, the contouring control of multi-DOF serial manipulators is developed for the first time and a new cross-coupled PD (CC-PD) control law is proposed, based on contour errors of the end-effector and tracking errors of the joints. It is a combination of PD control for trajectory tracking at joint level and PD control for contour tracking at the end-effector level. The contour error of the end-effector is transformed to the equivalent tracking errors of the joints using the Jacobian regulation, and the CC-PD control law is implemented in the joint level. Stability analysis of the proposed CC-PD control system is conducted using the Lyapunov method, followed by some simulation studies for linear and nonlinear contour tracking to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CC-PD control system. Keywords: contour tracking; contour error; contouring control; robot; cross-coupled control; PD control; Jacobian; stability analysis

1. Introduction Robotic manipulators are important for automation and industrial applications in contour tracking and trajectory tracking. Contour tracking is very popular in many industrial applications such as welding, laser cutting, and machining [1­4], and contouring control is one of the most important tasks for robotics and computer numerical control machine tools [5­9]. One of the most important issues in machining is the reduction of contour errors to ensure the quality of machined parts. In robotic applications such as precision machining, a desired task is often defined in terms of the end-effector (task space) motion: contour tracking motion [10,11]. Robotic technology can provide an excellent base to reduce the contour error because of its flexibility and affordability. A contour error is defined as the shortest distance between the current position and the desired contour curve, and contour error is a key factor used to evaluate the quality of a machined part. Conventional approach to deal with such a contouring problem is to treat it as a tracking control problem for each individual axis or joint. Unfortunately, reducing tracking error does not ensure reducing the contour error, because the contour error is a result of combined tracking errors of all axes or joints, and the dynamics of each axis is coupled with other axes for a nonlinear robotic system. To deal with contour tracking problems, the cross coupling control (CCC) method was first developed by Koren [1] for translational motion systems, followed by a variable-gain CCC in [2]. A PI

type cross coupling controller was developed for contour tracking of a linear bi-axis motion system based on linear control theory in [3]. A position loop-based cross-coupled control was proposed for a two-axis motion stage in [4]. Cheng [5] applied the fuzzy logic technology to deal with a free-form contour following problem by varying the feed rate of the system. Some surveys about the tracking and contour error control for CNC systems were presented in [6,7]. For simple contours, the contour error can be calculated analytically as discussed in [1,2]. To calculate contour errors of complex freeform contours, the concept of equivalent error was introduced for contouring control in [12]. A polar coordinate representation method was proposed in [13] to calculate contour errors for a biaxial translational motion system. Contour error estimation procedures for three-dimensional translational machining were developed in [8,9], based on the linear dynamic model of a CNC machine system. An orthogonal global task coordinate frame [14] for the calculation of contour errors was proposed and applied to a biaxial system. It should be noted that the majority of contouring control is focusing on biaxial or multi-axial translational motion systems that are linear dynamic systems. There are two types of applications for robot manipulators in the task space level: the task space trajectory tracking control and task space contour tracking control. For task space trajectory tracking control, Cheah [10] developed a set of task space PD control laws based on the Jacobian regulation. An adaptive tracking control was proposed for robots with unknown kinematic and dynamic properties in [11]. In addition, the adaptive technology was applied to the contour coupling control for a CNC system in [15]. As for the contouring control, a cross-coupled control algorithm based on the Lyapunov stability criteria and the recursive updating technique was proposed and applied to a two-link direct drive robot [16]. In addition, a contour control strategy based on the coordinate transformation was developed in [17]. The contour tracking problem for 2-DOF robots was discussed in [16­18], but there is no research on cross-coupled contour tracking control for multi-DOF robot manipulators. The main motivation of this research is to develop a contouring control system, called cross coupled PD (CC-PD) control, for multi-DOF robot manipulators with the combination of joint error and contour error as the feedback signals [19]. In the developed CC-PD control system, the contour errors in the end-effector are transformed to the equivalent tracking errors in the joint level through the Jacobian regulation [10], and the control law is implemented in the joint level to simplify the control system design and its implementation. 2. Dynamic Model and New Cross-Coupled Control Law In this section, the dynamic model of a multi-DOF robotic manipulator is presented, followed by an introduction of the contour error and its calculation. Then a transformation method is presented to transfer the contour error at the task level to the tracking error in the joint level. After that, the CC-PD control law is proposed for contouring tracking. 2.1. Dynamic Model of Robotic Manipulator The dynamic model of an n-DOF serial planar robotic manipulator with revolute joints can be expressed as [20]: .. . . . M ( q ) q ( t ) + C q, q q ( t ) + G ( q ) + F q =  ( t ) (1) where q (t) , q (t) , and q (t) are n × 1 joint position, velocity and acceleration vectors, defined as . functions of time; M (q) is the symmetric positive-definite n × n inertia matrix; C q, q is an n × n . matrix of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces; G (q) is an n × 1 vector of gravity terms; F q is an n × 1 vector of friction forces, and  (t) is an n × 1 vector of joint torques/forces. In this paper, some properties of a rigid nonlinear robotic manipulator [20] associated with Equation (1) is used in the stability analysis and are described as follows. (P1) The inertia matrix M (q) is symmetric positive definite.

2.2. Contour Error of End-Effector 2.2. Contour Error of End-Effector To obtain accurate contour trajectories is a fundamental requirement for modern high precision To obtain accurate contour trajectories is a fundamental requirement for modern high precision manufacturing. The contour error can be used to evaluate the quality of contour tracking, and it is manufacturing. The contour error can be used to evaluate the quality of contour tracking, and it defined as an orthogonal component of the derivation of an actual contour from the desired one. is defined as an orthogonal component of the derivation of an actual contour from the desired one. Figure 1 shows the relationship and difference between a tracking error and a contour error for an Figure 1 shows the relationship and difference between a tracking error and a contour error for an XY XY planar contour. planar contour.

where qid (t) and li are the desired joint position and the length of link i, respectively. qid purpose t and lof i are the desired joint position and the length of link i, respectively. where For the online calculation of the contour error ec , the following simple formulae For in the purpose calculation of the contour error , the following simple presented [1,2] is used of in online this paper. For a straight-line contour, theec contour error ec can be expressed as: formulae presented in [1,2] is used in this paper. For a straight-line contour, the contour error ec ec = -Cx ex + Cy ey with Cx = sin , Cy = cos (3) can be expressed as:

where  is the angle between thee desired straight line and the X-axis, ex and ey are the tracking errors (3) c = -C x ex + C y e y with C x = sin  , C y = cos  of the end effector in the X and Y axes, respectively. It can be seen that the contour error coefficients Cx and Cy are constant for linear contour tracking.

On the other hand, for a circular contour, the contour error coefficients are not constant and can be obtained by the following Equation [2]: ec = -Cx ex + Cy ey with Cx = sin - ex , 2R Cy = cos + ey 2R (4)

It should be mentioned that the angle  is not constant but a variable for a circular contour, related to the location of the desired circle contour. 2.3. Equivalent Tracking Error of Contour Error As mentioned in the introduction section, the proposed contouring control law is implemented in the joint level. Therefore, the contour error of the end-effector must be mapped to the joint tracking error. A correlation between the joint space and the task space can be easily obtained by the following forward kinematics of the robotic manipulator: Pt = f (q) (5)

where f (q) is a nonlinear mapping function from joint space to task space through the forward kinematics of the robotic manipulator. By differentiating Equation (5), the end-effector velocity is related with the joint space velocity as: Pt = f (q) = J (q) q
. . .

(6)

where J (q) is the Jacobian matrix that transforms the vector of the generalized joint velocities to the vector of the generalized end-effector velocities. As pointed out in [10], the Jacobian transpose regulator and inverse Jacobian regulator are very robust with respect to uncertainty in kinematic parameters. Transforming of control space is necessary as the contour performance is measured in the task space but the driving actuators are controlled in the joint space. Similar to the process discussed in [10], the following equation is used to build the relationship of the errors between the task space and the joint space: e P = J ( q ) eq . . . e P = J ( q ) eq + J ( q ) eq
T T

(7)

where e P = ex ey e is the error vector in the task space and eq = eq1 · · · eqn is the error vector in the joint space, respectively. As e does not affect the contour error according to Equation (3), submitting Equation (7) into Equation (3), one can see that the contour error can be expressed as a function of the tracking errors in the joint space as follows:   ec =
.  e c =

2.4. Cross-Coupled Contouring Controller As mentioned before, PD control is very popular for robots in industrial applications. In this paper, a cross-coupled contouring controller called CC-PD is proposed as follows:  = K p eq + Kd eq + Kcp ec + Kcd ec
. .

where K p and Kd are the proportional and derivative control gain matrices in the joint space; all these matrices are assumed to be positive definite. Kcp and Kcd are the proportional and derivative control vectors with positive values in the task space, respectively. From Equation (9), one can see that the proposed CC-PD is a combination of PD control in the joint space based on the tracking errors and PD control in the task space based on the contour errors. The PD controller in the joint space is used to maintain the stability of the robotic system, while the PD controller in the task space is used to reduce the contour errors. The goal for developing such a combined controller is to improve tracking performances at the joint level and the contour performances at the task level as well. Based on the Jacobian regulation, applying Equation (8) into Equation (9), the proposed CC-PD control law can be simplified as:  = K p + K cp eq + Kd + K cd eq   K cp = Kcp  K =K cd cd

According to Equations (10) and (11), it can be seen that the proposed CC-PD control law is an equivalent nonlinear PD control in the joint level, as the Jacobian matrix is a nonlinear function of the joint positions. 3. Stability Analysis The following notations are introduced to facilitate the stability analysis. m ( A) and  M ( A) represent the smallest and the largest eigenvalues of a positive define matrix A. If a square matrix A is positive definite, then it is denoted as A 0; If a square matrix A - B is positive definite, then it is denoted as A - B 0. For positive definite matrices, the following properties [21] will be used in this paper: (P5) If A (P6) If A 0, then A-1 0; If A  B 0, then B-1  A-1 0. 0 and B 0, then A + B 0, ABA 0, and BAB 0.

Theorem 1. For an n-DOF serial robotic manipulator described in Equation (1), if the proposed CC-PD control law in Equation (9) is applied to the system, the controlled robotic manipulator is globally stable for contouring control with bounded tracking errors, provided that the following conditions in Equation (15) are satisfied.

Proof of Stability of CC-PD Controller To prove the stability of the proposed CC-PD contouring controller, the Lyapunov theorem [20,22] is used by defining the following Lyapunov function candidate as: V= 1 2 eq eq

According to the proposition introduced in [20,22], it is demonstrated that matrix L is symmetric positive definite. In addition, the control gain matrix K d is symmetric positive definite. Therefore, the Lyapunov function V in Equation (16) is a positive definite function, i.e., V  0. Differentiating Equation (16) with respect to time, we have: V=

It should be mentioned that the same PD control gains were used for both PD and CC-PD control in the simulations, which is a simplification process for the purpose of comparison study. In order to pursuit a comprehensive and fair comparison between PD control and CC-PD control, it is necessary to use some artificial intelligent algorithms such as GA, PSO, and DE [26,27] to optimize the control gains based on contour tracking performances and the bounded control torques, and that will be a desired future research work. In this paper, only the linear and circular contours were tracked under the PD and CC-PD control laws. Theoretically, if the contour error estimation methods in [28,29] are used to replace Equation (4), the proposed CC-PD control can be applied to free-path contour tracking problems, and that will be a future research work. Additionally, this proposed control method can be applied in position domain [30,31] for contour tracking performance improvement. 5. Conclusions Contour tracking control is one of the most important tasks for motion control of the end-effector of a robotic manipulator. In this paper, a cross-coupled contouring control called CC-PD control was proposed for linear and nonlinear contour tracking control to a multi-DOF robotic manipulator. The proposed CC-PD control consists of a PD control in joint level for system stability and a PD contour control at the end-effector for contour tracking performance improvement. Based on the Jacobian regulation, the contour error was mapped to the joint tracking errors and the CC-PD control is implemented at the joint level. Stability analysis was conducted for the proposed CC-PD control and simulation verification study was performed. It is demonstrated that the CC-PD control is better than the PD control in terms of the reduction of contour errors at the end-effector level for linear and nonlinear contour cases. It also shows that the contour tracking performance can be improved with the increase of cross-coupled control gains. More complicated contour tracking control and the optimization of control gains for the proposed CC-PD control are some of the future work.
