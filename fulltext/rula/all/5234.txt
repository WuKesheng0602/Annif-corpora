Abstract: Silica-based and borate-based glass series, with increasing amounts of TiO2 incorporated, are characterized in terms of their mechanical properties relevant to their use as metallic coating materials. It is observed that borate-based glasses exhibit CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) closer to the substrate's (Ti6Al4V) CTE, translating into higher mode I critical strain energy release rates of glasses and compressive residual stresses and strains at the coating/substrate interface, outperforming the silica-based glasses counterparts. An increase in the content of TiO2 in the glasses results in an increase in the mode I critical strain energy release rate for both the bulk glass and for the coating/substrate system, proving that the addition of TiO2 to the glass structure enhances its toughness, while decreasing its bulk hardness. Borate-based glass BRT3, with 15 mol % TiO2 incorporated, exhibits superior properties overall compared to the other proposed glasses in this work, as well as 45S5 Bioglass® and Pyrex. Keywords: enameling; coefficient of thermal expansion; borate-based glass; indentation

1. Introduction Direct skeletal attachment (DSA) is a method used in prosthetics in which a metallic implant is attached directly to the patient's bone at the residual limb; concerns regarding DSA include infection and skin irritation [1­3]. Different approaches have been taken towards re-designing DSA devices for improving patient outcomes; these approaches usually involve modification of the surface by sandblasting the device surface, titanium plasma-spraying, plasma-spraying with hydroxyapatite (HA), coating the implant with a titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) layer through anodic oxidation, and applying a coating made from bioactive glass [4­6]. From these approaches, bioactive glasses have shown encouraging results over these other technologies when used as coatings [5]. The potential of bioactive glasses as coatings was first postulated with the development of Hench's 45S5 Bioglass® in the 1960s [7]. Bioglass® was the first synthetic material to chemically

adhere to both hard and soft tissue [7]. Although bioactive glasses have been employed for coating metals [8­11], these compositions have all, to date, contained alumina [8,11], which is associated with both defective bone mineralization and neurotoxicity [12]. Other compositions have been deficient in zinc [9­11], an antibacterial component [13­15] which aids the healing process by inhibiting the growth of caries-related bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans [16]. This work considers two distinct glass series, one based on silica (SiO2 ), one based on borate (B2 O3 ), with increasing amounts of titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) incorporated at the expense of silica and borate, respectively. B2 O3 has been shown to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of glasses [17], so that borate glasses have CTEs closer to that of the metallic substrate to be coated (typically Ti6Al4V, with a CTE of 9.5 × 10-6 / C in the range of 0­315  C [18]). Processing such glasses for use as coatings (e.g., through enameling [9], plasma spraying [19], electrophoretic deposition [20,21], or glazing [22]) requires heat treatment to allow for the glass to react with the substrate surface thus creating a chemical bond [23,24]. Once the bond has formed and the assembly is cooled, a difference in CTE between the glass and metal will induce residual stresses, hence causing cracks to appear in the glass or at the glass/substrate interface. For this reason, a borate-based glass series is proposed, to evaluate the effect of B2 O3 on its coating capability by means of its reduced CTE compared to silica-based glasses; a silica-based glass series is also proposed, with a homologous composition to that of the borate-based glass series, to allow for the evaluation of the effect of B2 O3 versus SiO2 on the resultant properties of the coating. Additionally, TiO2 is incorporated in these glasses as it helps promote a more stable chemical bond when coating such a glass onto Ti6Al4V [17]. Additionally, titanium is known to create a permanent bond to bone, via osseointegration [25,26]. In terms of metal coating techniques, enameling is probably one of the most widely used. Among the different findings in the literature, researchers have found that low firing temperatures and short sintering times did not help the glass to spread along the substrate surface, ultimately resulting in a very porous coating [8], that silica-based glasses with significantly high percentage of SiO2 exhibit better adhesion to the metallic substrate due to lesser thermal expansion mismatch between the glass and the substrate [27], and that smaller processing windows (the range between glass transition and crystallization temperature where the coating is heat treated to) favors crystallization hence reducing bioactivity of the glass [28]. Other coating methods have been explored, including reactive plasma spraying [19], electrophoretic deposition [20], and dip coating [29]. Good adhesion has been reported using these methods; however, these methods may require sintering at high temperatures [19,20,29], which may hinder the bioactive performance of glass due to crystallization, and they produce fragile coatings [29], compromising the mechanical stability of the coating. Indentation-based measurement methods allow a quick and qualitative measurement of the adhesion [11,30­32]. Such tests can also be used to quantify fracture toughness of the material by the direct measurements of cracking after indentation [33­39]. A common example is the Vickers indentation fracture (VIF) test, which measures the lengths of the cracks emanating from the Vickers indents. This technique was first developed by Lawn et al. [33], under the assumption that such cracks were created due to tensile stresses that form during unloading. Anstis et al. [34] validated Lawn's model for several ceramics and glasses by comparing the fracture toughness obtained from the VIF test with the ones obtained from standard fracture tests. Later, Laugier [39] showed that indentation crack geometry in glasses and ceramics were different and claimed that Lawn's model required some modifications when used for the evaluation of ceramic toughness, and therefore developed a new model that described the indentation cracking in ceramics more realistically. In this study, both glass series will be evaluated to determine their coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and its effect on the residual stresses and strains post-coating, their critical strain energy release rate in mode I (opening) of the coating/substrate system through double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimens and of the bulk glass through Vickers indentation, and their bulk hardness.

However, the proposed silica-based Ti6Al4V, compared toto the silica-based However,the theCTE CTEfor for the proposed silica-based glasses was significantly lower than what has been reported for other similar glasses (e.g., CTE of glasses was significantly lower than what has been reported for other similar glasses (e.g., CTE of Bioglass® 45S5 has been reported to be 15.1 × 10-6/°C over the range from 200 to 400 °C [32]), indicating Bioglass® 45S5 has been reported to be 15.1 × 10-6 / C over the range from 200 to 400  C [32]), that the proposed silicate formulations would provide better adhesion to the metallic substrate indicating that the proposed silicate formulations would provide better adhesion to the metallic compared to other silica-based glasses. Since the addition of TiO2 increased the CTE, the control substrate compared to other silica-based glasses. Since the addition of TiO2 increased the CTE, silicate formulation should be analyzed to understand the causes behind the reduced CTE. Compared the control silicate formulation should be analyzed to understand the causes behind the reduced CTE. to 45S5, SRT0 contains a higher molar percentage of SiO2 and contains ZnO at 16 mol %, whereas Compared 45S5, SRT0 contains a higher molar percentage ofto SiO at 16 mol %, 2 and contains 45S5 doesto not include ZnO.

Furthermore, ZnO increase (or inclusion, in this case) has been proven to into an increase in the CTE. Furthermore, ZnO increase (or in this case) has been to proven decrease the CTE of silica-based glasses [44], explaining the inclusion, reduced CTE of SRT0 compared 45S5. to decrease the the CTE of silica-based glasses [44], explaining the reduced CTE SRT0 compared to 45S5. Since CTEs of the borate-based glasses are lower than that of the of substrate, the difference in Since the CTEs of the borate-based glasses are lower than that of the substrate, the difference shrinkage caused the glass coating to experience compressive residual stresses. Compressive residual in shrinkage caused the glass coating to experience compressive residual stresses. Compressive residual stresses are beneficial, acting to prevent cracks from propagating, thus requiring higher stresses to cause coating failure [45­47]. On the other hand,from the CTE of the silica-based glasses induced stresses are beneficial, acting to prevent cracks propagating, thus requiring higher positive stresses to residual stresses, promoting the growth of hand, cracksthe under loading cause coating failure [45­47]. On the other CTE of the [45,48]. silica-based glasses induced positive As shown in Figure 5, the measured bulk G IC of the control glass of the silica-based series, SRT0, residual stresses, promoting the growth of cracks under loading [45,48]. was found to in beFigure comparable that of fused glass. However, as of the percentage of TiO 2 in the As shown 5, theto measured bulksilica GIC of the control glass the silica-based series, SRT0, silica-based glass series was increased, the mean G IC value increased, with significant differences (p was found to be comparable to that of fused silica glass.

improve their mechanical properties [49], due to their small ionic radius and high electrical charge [50] that tends to strengthen the bonds in the glass. The bulk GIC of the control glass in the borate series, BRT0, was found not to be significantly different (p < 0.05) from that of SRT0; however, the bulk GIC of the remaining borate-based glasses were lower than their counterpart in the silica-based series. This is not surprising, as previous studies on boro-silicate glasses have shown that the incorporation of B2 O3 at the expense of SiO2 can decrease the fracture toughness (directly related to GIC through Equation (1)) [51,52]. Furthermore, similar to the silica-based series, the incorporation of TiO2 in the borate series glasses increased the fracture toughness. In terms of the GIC of the coating/substrate system, the presently used DCB testing method was first published by Matinmanesh et al. [53], establishing the GIC for SRT0-based systems at 6.20 ± 0.60 J/m2 . The current work expanded on these findings, determining that an increase in TiO2 content resulted in an increase in critical strain energy release rate, peaking at 12.08 ± 1.72 J/m2 for the silica-based coatings, and 18.50 ± 1.60 J/m2 for the borate-based coatings. This work supports the previous findings that titanium in the glass coating enhances chemical bonding to the titanium substrate [17], resulting in a larger measured GIC for the SRT3 and BRT3 systems, both with 15 mol % of TiO2 incorporated. Additionally, the trends of the GIC for the bulk glass and the coating/substrate system are similar, i.e., an increase in incorporated TiO2 translated into an increase in GIC . This is similar to the work of Li et al. [54], who studied the effect of the incorporation of strontium oxide into borate-based glass coatings applied to Ti6Al4V substrates, and found that GIC increased as the amount of strontium oxide increased. The residual stress in the SRT0 coating using the measured values of the CTE was estimated to be 9.6 ± 2.4 MPa (Section 2.2). This is consistent (no significant difference, p < 0.05) with the 8.6 ± 1.0 MPa value found by Matinmanesh et al. [53] for the same SRT0 coating/substrate system using measurements of the radius of curvature of the coated assembly. Comparing the presented GIC values in Figure 5 with those in Figure 7 revealed that the glasses in the silica-based series have higher critical strain energy release rates in bulk form compared to when they are applied to the coating/substrate. On the contrary, in the borate based series, the GIC was higher for the coating/substrate system. This effect may be attributed to the nature of the residual stresses that are created during the coating process, i.e., tensile in silica-based systems and compressive in borate-based systems (Section 2.2), with compressive residual stresses providing additional resistance to crack growth. The bulk hardness of the silica-based glass series decreased as the amount of TiO2 incorporated into the glasses increased, while, in statistical terms, the hardness of the borate-based glasses did not significantly change (p < 0.05) with the addition of TiO2 . The hardness of the borate-based glasses however, was significantly higher than the silica-based equivalent glasses at 5 and 15 mol % incorporated TiO2 . The decrease in hardness with increasing incorporation of TiO2 is consistent with the observed increase in fracture toughness, which is inversely proportionally to the hardness of the glass (Equation (6)). 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Glass Preparation Silica-based and borate-based glasses in this study were synthesized (compositions and nomenclature are reported in Table 1) and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), among other techniques [55]. TiO2 was added at the expense of SiO2 for the SRT series and at the expense of B2 O3 for the BRT series. The glasses were prepared by weighing out appropriate amounts of analytical grade reagents (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada & Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada), firing in silica crucibles (1400­1500  C for 1 h for the silica-based glasses, 1200  C for 1 h for borate-based glasses), and shock quenching in water. The resulting frit was then ball-milled, and sieved to retrieve glass particulates 20 µm.

4.1.1. Discs Preparation Approximately 200 mg of each glass were pressed into a cylindrical mold with the diameter of 6 mm using a hydraulic press with pressure ranging between 2500 and 3000 psi. The sample thicknesses were 2.84 ± 0.19 mm. The pressed discs were then heat treated to promote the coalescence of glass particles and create a sturdy solid to be used for CTE and hardness testing. The heat treatment consisted of firing the discs at temperature Tcoat (Table 2) for 15 min, then allowing them to cool down to room temperature. 4.1.2. Coating Preparation Coatings were prepared following the procedure developed by Matinmanesh et al. [53] for enameling Ti6Al4V with bioactive glasses in an ethanol-based suspension. Ti6Al4V substrate samples were degreased and cleaned in ethanol prior to coating. For each glass formulation, a suspension of the glass powder in ethanol (ratio of 5:1, ethanol to glass mass) was deposited on the substrates. Afterwards, the coatings were allowed to air-dry for 30 min, and were then fired at temperature Tcoat , ranging between the glass transition temperature (Tg ) and the crystallization temperature (Tx ) of each glass (Table 2), for 15 min.

4.2. Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) Measurement by Linear Dilatometry The CTE of each glass was tested based on the current ASTM E228 "Standard Test Method for Linear Thermal Expansion of Solid Materials with a Push-Rod Dilatometer" [56]. Samples were prepared following the procedure outlined in Section 4.1.1, with samples measuring 6 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height (by stacking 4 discs), and tested with a Netzsch DIL 402 PC dilatometer (Netzsch Instruments, Burlington, MA, USA). A heating rate of 4  C/min was employed, with a testing temperature range from 25 to 300  C for both the glass series. Based on the measured lengths and temperature changes, CTE was determined as

where m is the mean CTE of the glass, T is the change in temperature with respect to the initial temperature, L0 is the initial length of the test specimen, and L is the change in length of the sample with respect to the initial length L0 . 4.3. Residual Stress and Strain Analysis Due to the mismatch between the CTE of the substrate and of the coating, residual stresses at the interface were induced. Based on the measured CTE as per Section 4.2, and based on the cooling profile and temperatures as per Section 4.1.2, residual strains were computed as res = glass - Ti6Al4V (Tcoat - Ti ) (3)

where res is the calculated residual strain, glass is the CTE of the glass, Ti6Al4V is the CTE of the titanium substrate (9.5 × 10-6 / C), Tcoat is the coating temperature (from Table 2), and Ti is the room temperature (25  C). This approach has already been proposed and verified by Oel and Frechette [57]. To determine the residual stresses, Yu et al. [58] proposed the use of beam theory on bi-layer materials with different CTEs subjected to thermal loading. The residual stress at the interface experienced by the glass coating is c P(ts + tc ) t2 (4) res_glass = 2Es Is 2Ic + Ec where P=

and ts is the thickness of the titanium substrate (3.15 mm), tc is the thickness of the glass coating (90 µm), Is is the second moment of area of the titanium substrate, defined as Is = 12s where w is the width of the titanium substrate and of the glass coating (11 mm), Ic is the second moment of area of the glass coating, defined as Ic = 12c Es is the modulus of elasticity of the titanium substrate (110 GPa), Ec is the modulus of elasticity of the glass coating (35 GPa [59]), As is the cross-sectional area of the titanium substrate, defined as As = w ts , and Ac is the cross-sectional area of the glass coating, defines as Ac = w tc . 4.4. Vickers Hardness Samples (n = 3) for hardness testing were prepared as described in Section 4.1.1. An HM-114 Mitutoyo Testing Machine (Mitutoyo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was utilized, equipped with a Vickers indenter, to load the samples with a force of 1 kgf (9.81 N) for 10 s. The indent diagonals were measured through the integrated optical microscope at 20×. 4.5. Bulk Mode I Critical Strain Energy Release Rate Using Vickers Indentation The mode I critical strain energy release rate of the bulk glasses was measured by indenting glass discs (prepared as per Section 4.1.1 and indented similarly to the process described in Section 4.4). A schematic depiction of the indentation is shown in Figure 8. According to Anstis et al. [34], the indentation load needs to be large enough to create an indent pattern that is well-defined and cracks that are longer than the indent diameter (2a), yet shorter than one tenth of the thickness of the sample (300 µm in this case) to avoid interactions with the lower free surface of the specimen. The indentation load is considered too large if it breaks the sample or causes a chipping on the sample's surface [34].
