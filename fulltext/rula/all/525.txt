John Zaki Bou-Younes A Database Development and Analysis of Selected Side Impact Collisions In Toronto Ryerson University, Master of Applied Science, 2003

Abstract

This thesis is based on the initial phase of a project that developed an in-depth collision database and performed an analysis of police reported side-impact collisions for City of Toronto intersections between 1998 and 2000. Currently, collision data exists through

several different sources in Ontario. The development of a database involving the amalgamation of collision forms, the selection of data fields, and the collection of real collision data from selected, thoroughly investigated side impact collisions involving late model , vehicles (1998 and newer), is described. For analysis, Statistical Analysis Software Release 8.02 was used to investigate causation and casual factors of side impact collisions. Statistically significant collision factors determined by fault propensity included apparent driver action, driver age, front seat passenger age, maximum posted speed, approximate vehicle speed, road character, and number of lanes. For intersection collision propensity, statistically significant findings included the system used, presence of flashing signals, intersection legs, roadway volume, and intersection leg road classifications. It is

anticipated that the findings from this analysis can provide insight into significant factors in side-impact collisions that will be applied with greater focus to the in-depth collision database, once developed.

1 Introduction
1.1 General
This is a thesis based on a portion of an ongoing research project involving a multidisciplinary approach to side-impact collision investigation. The main objective or underlying drive for that research project stems from a statement taken from the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) [1], that involved the following question ~nd answer:

I'm shopping for a new car. Why can't I find driver death rate or insurance loss data for new models? It takes considerable time to gather and tabulate the real-world data needed to provide statistlcalJy~ significant results for new models. Complete vehicle registration data for each model year typically are released about two years later, and data on fatalities are first available approximately nine months after the end of the calendar year. Similarly, it takes time to amass sufficient insurance claims information to provide meaningful results for a range of vehicles. For vehicles that have not been fundamentally redesigned, previous model year results are good predictors of the current model's experience.

Hence, a case has been made for the need for up-to-date collision data based on new vehicle models, as it comprises an important component for driver death rate and insurance loss data and may be a deciding factor in the purchase of a new or late model vehicle. Furthennore, current late model vehicle safety data are based on mainly two sources: crash vehicle laboratory testing, and databases containing very recent collision records. The pros and cons of

laboratory testing are not discussed in this paper. However, limitations exist when using laboratory sanitized conditions to determine factors involved in motor vehicle collisions. Very recent collision data on late model vehicles published by the IIHS has created a perception in the general public that certain models are safer than others, when tables published for various

categories of passenger vehicles are compared.

Table 1.1 below includes

selected excerpts from their online website where particular recent models are tallied with their respective driver death rates.

These rates may make it all too easy for the general public to believe particular models are superior to others. While it may be true that particular vehicle models are dangerously over-powered, have insufficient brakes, terribly high centre of gravities, poor construction, etc., certain figures may cause readers to · believe that some models are in fact "dangerous", or perhaps the opposite, giving them a false sense of security. This is particularly the case because of the lack of normalization for exposure and other measures required in making more legitimate and fair comparisons. Normalizing for Driver Death Rates for Million Registered Vehicle Years, as they have, does not necessarily"account for the use of these vehicles (i.e., high use vehicles such as taxis, fleet vehicles, as compared to personal vehicles), nor for driver types (Le. elderly vs young) and a host of other confounding factors. Clearly. there is more to this than just vehicle driver death rates.

It is commonly accepted amongst transportation engineers that there are three

main types factors involved in road safety and collision investigation: · · · Vehicle factors, as mention above; Human (Driver) factors; and Environmental factors.

The objective of human factors in road safety is primarily to improve safety through the understanding of the link between' humans, vehicles and their environment. Driver workload, fatigue, reaction time are just a few classic examples of studies repeated in search of this link. Humans have capabilities, but they are limittd. In fact, some may argue that researchers are most

interested in human limitations rather than capabilities. Regardless, human physical, perceptual and cognitive capabilities are significant since all vehicles require a human driver who is in control. One study performed in 1977 by Treat et al determined that human error contributed to 90% of a subset of collisions This supports a commonly accepted notion that "bad drivers" cause collisions.

Environmental factors include external or extrinsic physical conditions that affect and influence the operation of a motor vehicle. The conditions that vehicles are operated in can significantly contribute to the occurrence of vehicle collisions. Several of these factors can lie outside the direct cuntrol of

a driver, transportation planner, or law-maker (i.e., illumination, road surface, weather conditions, etc.,) while others (Le., lane widths, signal timing, roadside furniture, etc,.) can lie within this control. Typically, only experts in each field can make contributions that increase efficiency and improve upon the safety aspects of environmental factors.

Managing these three aspects are not typically easily accomplished by a transportation engineer, or for that matter, by any individual professional. Yet. in order to maximize effectiveness, simultaneous consideration of these three factors is required. The solution lies in the combined efforts of multiple

professionals, where factors within vehicle, driver and environment can be tackled separately, with appropriate expertise. The concept of a multi-

disciplinary approach to collision investigation is only' recently emerging. and a portion of this report includes recent efforts made as part of an on-going investigation in side impact collisions. The analysis of these three types of factors depends on collision data. Recent collision data are always in demand. Findings based on outdated collision data may be just that - outdated. This report shall illustrate sources, types and methods for analysis of side impact collisions in Toronto, its usefulness as part of a linked data set for analysis. and its analysis to bring out factors associated with these collisions with respect to driver, environmental and vehicle attributes.

Collisions have traditionally been classified in many ways.

Side impact

collisions are particularly important because they are unique. Unlike other collisions such as frontal and rear, occupants in target vehicles have very little protection.
In fact, less than eight (8) centimeters typically separate the

occupant on the side that is struck from the striking vehicle.

There are

essentially no bumpers, engines, etc, to help absorb the energy of the impact. Therefore, these types of impacts can cause severe injury; especially to the occupant on the side the vehicle,was struck [2].

In 2001, 39.2% of all Ontario collisions accounted for occurrences of side

impact collisions (where side impact collisions are identified by police as: Angle, Sideswipe, and Turning Movement) [3]. However, this number may be conservative, as many collisions that fall outside of these categories may still be considered side impact collisions (i.e., when motor vehicles slide into roadside furniture in a sideways manner).

1.2 Thesis Arrangement
This thesis is divided into six chapters. Following the Introduction, Chapter 2 summarizes the literature reviewed on recent and emerging analyses
concerning similar collision data. This chapter also includes analyses from

different studies using different data for the purpose of establishing that these techniques indeed have competent applications to the data in this study.

2 Literature Review
2.1 General
Through the many resources afforded by on line catalogues at Ryerson University and The University of Toronto, a literature review of past, present and emerging studies on the analysis and identification of factors involved in side impact collisions is provided in this chapter.

2.2 Literature on Methods of Collision Assessment
A recent paper by Persaud et al in 2003 reviewed various methods in isolating causes of collisions , and assessing effects of treatments, using both routinely available and specifically collected databases. Their review breaks down road

safety studies as falling under essentially two categories: Experimental Studies and Observational Studies. Of particular interest is the latter type, where

methodology of past and emerging ~()hort and case-control studies are explored. Cohort studies are described as the identification of two otherwise comparable groups, or cohorts, (alike enough to be compared, at least after controlling for measured confounding variables), that differ by some variable of interest (e.g., exposure to a particular program or a particular engineering feature) and involves following them over time to asses differences in consequences (e.g., their collision record) [4].

The above research paper is based on the case-control study type, used in two separate analyses. This type of study differs slightly from cohort studies in that case-control studies have a known outcome where one group, the case group, is attributed with this known outcome, and the other group, the control, is not attributed with this outcome. Persaud et al (2003) noted that in many

transportation safety studies, the estimate of safety effect can be difficult to interpret, because it is usually not possible to statistically control for all confounders such as speeds, sight distance, and geometry [4]. Furthennore, case control and cohort studies are subject to selection biases because sample entities may differ in unacknowledged but nonetheless important ways from the population.

Findings from their paper expose advantages of case-control analysis as a
·

preliminary step in investigating collision safety data. Perhaps the most notable suggestion involves the use of a two part analysis with a case-control preliminary analysis followed by a cohort study that avoids the bias commonly found in a sole case-control analysis. An example of how a case control study could be expected to be constructed following their suggestions can be seen in Figure 2.1.

data, including outcome variables. The reliance on case-control studies alone to determine these relationships expose problems of bias that are much less common in cohort studies, [4] and using both types of analysis, as shown above, overcomes this issue. Furthermore, cohort studies have the advantage of

generally being prospective in design- the outcome is not known at the beginning of the study and therefore is less likely to influence the collection of data-and of better collection of data to ensure comparability [5].

2.3 Literature for Side Impact and Left Turning Collision Data Analysis
Past research shows that there is a higher risk involved in making left turning movements at intersections as compared to other intersection movements. The reasons for this include crossing of two directions of traffic and estimating speeds of oncoming traffic [6]. Researchers such as Kirk et al [6] have

for period of day (day or night); and, between occupancy rate.

In addition, the authors note the disagreements between researchers in determining ideal exposure methods for each application, as traditional methods are based on estimating the amount of v_~hicle-miles traveled (VMT) by simply multiplying the average daily traffic (ADT) with the length of roadway [6]. A quasi-induced exposure is used to avoid limitations existent in estimations of driver exposure from these and other exogenous' values such as travel distance, drivers licensed, and vehicles registered. The data itself are used to derive exposure estimates [8]. For instance, it is known that certain driver groups modify their driving , pattern towards proportionately more exposure to lowspeed and daylight situations and proportionally less exposure to high speed and night situations. Exposure based solely on total distance driven does not

account for these changes in driving patterns [7].

Furthermore, these methods have been validated against more conventional techniques [8] and are becoming common practice. Surrogates for vehicledistance of travel by different classifications of road users are acceptable, granted that an assumption is made bearing a consistent composition of road users.

The format for one such analysis uses relative collision involvement rates

',....

(RAIR) [8]. RAIR are calculated by taking the ratio of the percentage of atfault drivers of one group within a given category, to the percentage of not-atfault drivers from another category within the same group. It is considered a form of quasi-induced exposure since the distributions of both types of drivers is a representative sample of the same exposures of all drivers in the group.

Of further interest with this method is the necessity to define at-fault and not atfault drivers. The researchers assigned fault in a crash from information

contained in the accident database, where available. This relied on a human factor category that indicated each driver's contribution to the colIision. Cases where fault was indeterminate or otherwise when both drivers were simultaneously at fault or not-at-fault were excluded for, this study.

Factors selected in their study included age, gender, period of day, and number of occupants. Examination of these factors· both individually and in

simultaneous combinations were used to focus on particular categories and conditions which were exceedingly unsafe. The analysis used a logistic

regression with a statistical significance at the 0.05 level, with a dichotomous independent variable (fault vs not-at-fault), where the probability of the at-fault driver is:

P (driver is at fault) = 1/(1 +e'Z)

=driver factors, confounding factors, and interactions [6]. The effect of

the independent variables on the crash rates employed a multivariate analysis.

Interestingly, over half (32 out of a total 56) of the published RAIR values in the study were not statistically significant at the 5% level [6].

This methodology and similar types are commonly used by researchers for analysis of categorical collision data. In fact, another study on motor vehicle crashes in Ontario ,that cross-sectionally examined factors affecting the severity of motor vehicle traffic crashes (MVTCs) by class (i.e., fatal, major, minor, etc.) was performed, where percentage distributions of crashes at each level of severity were examined according to specific factors and tested using bivariate analyses (X2 test, P < 0.05) [9]. The researchers chose to limit the analysis to variables that were both restricted to observations without missing observations and those statistically significant to the 0.05 level (as determined through bivariate analysis). Note that these researchers were fortunate to have a large sample size, as it exceeded 34,000 collisions (after exclusion of observations) with excellent data integrity (less than 2% missing values). Initial findings

include determination of 18 factors which achieved statistical significance in the bivariate analysis, listed as follows:

One portion of the analysis consisted of calculating relative risks through crude odds ratios (COR) for a primary comparison, complete with their 95% confidence intervals.

Odds ratios are briefly explained as ratios of probabilities for success/failure, where the probability of success, p and the probability of failure, q = I-p.

In such a case, the odds of success are defined as

Odds(success)::; p/q
t

(2.3)

t ,
The odds of failure would be the inverse of the odds of success,

1

Odds(failure)::; q/p

(2.4)

The odds of success and failure are clearly reciprocals of each other.

, In order to determine the OR ideally, the odds of success for two or more
different groups within a category are divided by each other. Variations on this exist and many valid OR scenarios often exist (i.e., where the inverse is true, where the odds of success for two or more different categories for a group are compared, etc.).

For example, gIven that 9 out of 10 teenage drivers survive side impact collisions while only 6 out of 10 elderly drivers survive in the same conditions, the probabilities for teenage driver survival are:

p =9/10 =0.9
q = 1-0.9::; 0.1

(2.5) (2.6)

And for elderly drivers:
- ]5 -

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

p =6/10 =0.6

(2.7) (2.8)

q = 1-0.6 =0.4

These probabilities are then used to determine the respective OR of success (successful in survival event occurring).

Odds(teenage survival) = p/q = 0.9/0.1 = 9.0

(2.9)

Odds(elderly survival) = p/q = 0.6/0.4 = 1.5

(2.10)

Finally. we can calculate the OR of teenage vs elderly survival as:

Odds Ratio. OR =9.0/ 1.5 =6.0

(2.11)

This value is greater than 1.0 which indicates that the odds of teenage vs. elderly survival under the given conditions are 6.0 times greater for teenagers as compared to the elderly. (given identical assumptions). Note that confidence intervals should also be considered and issues arise when confidence intervals straddle a range inclusive of 1.0. In such cases, the propensity and value for a given group to be either a factor that is increasingly or decreasingly causative is indeterminate.

Through screening literature, it was found that selected published research papers included crude odds ratios in their analysis. This is rather troublesome, as crude odds ratios are inferior and do not account for potential correlations between factors. For instance, a portion of the previously mentioned analysis is

not ideal, particularly since it did not control for other effects of unaccounted for factors [9]. To account for this, multivariate unconditional logistic

regression analyses were employed to estimate each specific factor in relation to crash severity while controlling for these other effects. The importance in

controlling for these other effects is very important. Through a multivariate analysis, SAS computed Adjusted Odds Ratios. Using similar criteria to the first portion of their analysis, (the bivariate analyses X2, P < 0.05), SAS · computed that the majority of these factors were still significant. However, the magnitude of the adjusted odds rations decreased considerably compared with the crude ORs. On the other hand, the multivariate analyses showed that several factors including the month, hour, road alignment, light conditions, and vehicle type were no longer statistically significant and road surface condition was inversely associated with fatal crashes [9]. The relationships between the

findings from the bivariate and multivariate analysis are not clear. Some may argue that it is a worthless comparison.

The trend of selected variables being no longer statistically significant when analyzed in-depth at the multivariate level continues to the final component of

the study, where significance similarly at p < 0.05 level through the log likelihood test in SAS. This test reveals that only two of the variables remain statistically significant, namely driver age and driver condition. Even at first glance, numerous OR values (and 95% confidence intervals) are seen tottering above and below 1.0. The usefulness of much of the report's published tables on adjusted OR are therefore questionable, but its methodology and purpose are exemplary. In this study, quasi-induced exposure is recommended due to the difficulty and present unavailability of travel estimates.

Interestingly, another similar study where experimentation with logistic regression models were used to explain similar dependent and independent variables was performed [10]. Several regression analyses of driving record variables over a six-year time period (1986 -1991) were performed to compare the results obtained using various techniques and found that this did not yield different results. The techniques compared were ordinary least squares,

weighted least squares, Poisson, negative binomial, linear probability and logistic regression models.

Through the process of literature review, an appreciation for normalized data and meaningful analysis became apparent. In similar studies, many weaknesses exist. Even one recently (2001) published paper by Pulugurtha et al [11] is easily criticized as tables and results are limited to frequencies and percentages

by category, with no mention of missing neither data nor consideration for level of significance.

Another superior study used logistic regression to analyze collision data to identify driver, highway, and environmental factors that differentiate collisions with a dichotomous independent outcome variable [12]. Logistic regression determines

f3 coefficients that make the observed outcome most "likely," using

the maximum-likelihood method. Since the model is nonlinear, an iterative algorithm is used to estimate coefficients [13]. The validity of each variable's presence in the regression model is checked by examining the statistical level of significance (LOS) for its f3 coefficient. A typical acceptance level for LOS is 0.05, which
indic~tes

that if the f3 parameter were equal to zero, the probability

of seeing a value of p as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is less than 0.05 (5%) [12].

Independent (explanatory) variables included in their research paper, falling under three major categories, are:

Driver: · age, gender and alcohol involvement;

Highway:

- 19-

·

location, horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, setting, speed limit, and type of highway; and,

Environmental: · light conditions, pavement conditions.

Interestingly, where categorical (zero-one) variables were needed to represent different conditions within a given category, the number of zero-one columns is always one less than the number of conditions (i.e., three categorical zero-one variables were needed to represent four different light conditions, and two variables were used for three pavement conditions) [12].

Zero-one variables were set with hypothesized collision. contributing conditions as 1. The "base" condition (all categorical variables equal to zero) represented an intersection on a flat section of straight roadway in an urban area during daylight when the pavement was dry and the driver had not been drinking. From this base condition, the increase in collision odds attributed to each independent variable can be computed from the logistic regression coefficients [12]. Of particular interest is the method used to split the categories. For instance, age groupings were determined by varying the range of ages in a model until the age variable was no longer statistically significant within the age group [12]. They were fortunate to have over 400,000 observations and achieve low levels of statistical significance (0.00005) for several of their models.

A similar breakdown of independent explanatory variables by driver, vehicle and environmental variables are found in a report titled "An Evaluation of Severity and Outcome of Injury by Type of Object Struck (First Object Struck Only) for Motor Vehicle Crashes in Connecticut" [14]. Variables were derived from several sources of data, all falling under the umbrella of the State of Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT). Record Types from Crash Summary Records, Traffic Unit Information Records, and Involved Person Records, were linked together., This created information pertinent to the:

· · ·

crash as a whole; identification of each vehicle or pedestrian involved in a crash; and, information about vehicle operators, struck pedestrians, passengers, 'and witnesses.

This linking process allows an in-depth analysis of severity and outcome of injury, providing a more complete picture of the effects of crashes with any particular collision. Their study used variables similar to the other reviewed papers above, with variables classified in seven different categories (as opposed to three), namely: 1. demographic factors including age and gender; 2. geographic factors including location of the crash and location of the fixed object struck; 3. subjective factors including speeding, following too closely, violating traffic controls, unsafe use of highway, etc;

- 21 -

4. objective factors including driver illness, vehicle involved emergency;

In

5. road and weather/season condition including construction and road surface; 6. police judgment/investigation including whether or not the driver had been drinking; and. 7. clinical variables.

Interestingly, the categories within each of these variables differ from report to report. In their study, categorization was as follows: · drivers' age having five subgroups: age less than 25 years, 25 to 44, 45 to 64, 65 to 74, and greater than 74 years.); · length of (hospital) stay categorized into three groups: Emergency Department (ED) treated and released, inpatient with length of stay equal to 1 day, and inpatient with length of stay greater than 1 day; and, · mortality categorized as died at the crash site, ED death (died in hospital with zero length of stay), died as inpatient (died in hospital with length of stay equal to or greater than 1 day), and died after discharge.

The methodology used was almost identical to the above mentioned report (McGuinnis et aI, 1998) where all categorical variables were converted into binary variables, as required for the analysis. Stepwise logistic regression

models were constructed with Level of Significance (LOS) of 0.01 and 0.05 for entrance and exit, respectively, to identify parsimonious sets of independent variables.

A Review of the Evidence fot Factors Affecting Incidence and Severity [15] reveal several key components summarized from a wealth of related and recent collision studies. Driver, vehicle and environmental characteristics are

determined to play relevant parts in these crashes, as the review authors stated that,

"Older drivers, the variability in the size and weight of the vehicles sharing the roads, the characteristics of intersections and the mechanisms used to influence traffic flow all combine to affect the rates of occurrence of side impact crashes. Older vehicle

occupants, presumably because of increased physical frailty, are more likely to be killed or injured, especially in the target vehicle."

The paper also reveals "evidence that wearing the seatbelts will reduce the risk and severity of injury, although this clearly does not affect the risk of collision in the first place" [15].

But the argument exists that seatbelts do indeed "affect the risk of collision in the first place", as seatbelts are often overlooked for their added benefit of keeping the driver restrained and in control of the vehicle. The Canadian Health Network states that "Besides protecting people in a collision, seat belts also keep the driver in place so they can stay in control of the car" [16]. Should the vehicle require a sharp tum or hard deceleration, seatbelts may make the difference between a driver remaining in an ideal seating position versus moving loosely around, losing control and potentially having a collision. In fact, this paper [16] reveals,

,I

I

"Seat belts reduce your chances of dying in an accident by 45 to 55%. They reduce your chances of serious injury by about 50%. Child passenger restraints (infant car seats) reduce the risk of death and serious injuries by about 70%. In' 1997 in Alberta, people who used restraints were much less likely to be injured in a crash (14.7%) than those who didn't use them (35.7%). Transport Canada estimates that since 1989, the increased use of seatbelts has avoided 66,000 injuries."

Without further criticism of one specific comment from an otherwise outstanding paper, other findings include that evidence exists to better engineer intersections "whether as roundabouts, or by adding appropriate traffic controls, or improving sightlines for approaching vehicles" [15]. Several studies

reviewed in the paper identify numerous vehicle design factors such as "the disparity in the size and weight of vehicles sharing the road... a particular challenge to vehicle designers". Furthermore, the authors noted,

"A number of design features - in brakes, to make it easier for the bullet vehicle to stop to avoid a crash, in the strength and energyabsorbing capacity of the target vehicle, to protect its occupants from intrusion, in the design of interior surfaces of the target vehicle, in the visibility of either vehicle so that drivers have more warning to avoid a crash ... "

In addition to vehicle design features, intersection features are also of great interest in determining causes of side impact collisions. Of particular

importance is signal phasing, especially since many side impact collisions occur at intersections, where left-turning vehicles narrowly cross other vehicle's paths with synchrony. A recently published report by the National Cooperative

Highway Research Program (NCHRP) comprehensively evaluates safety and Protective Permissive Lefteffectiveness of signal displays, with emphasis on -------- --_. ---.-_.
~--. --~-

Turn Control (PPLT). A key concern with PPLT control is the "yellow trap,"

which occurs during the change from permitted left turns in both directions to a lagging protected left turn in one direction [17]. In layman's terms, this happens when a vehicle enters an intersection on a priority (or protected) phase attempting a left-turn maneuver when suddenly, the priority phase turns amber, and the opposing thru traffic commences, thereby leaving the driver vulnerable to the oncoming traffic. This occurs for a number of reasons, and the report describes this issue as it pertains to many of the phasing systems (shown in Figure 2.2) used throughout the United States.

As evidenced by the multiple phasing and display options identified above, "accommodating left-turning vehicles at signalized intersections has been an ongoing concern for transportation engineers as they seek a balance between intersection capacity and safety through signal pha,:;ing techniques" [17]. Through surveys, field studies and controlled lab experiments, measurements on the comprehension of these signal systems and phasing schedules were determined. Confusion based on the sampled driver population'S lack of

understanding of these signal systems, particularly priority phases and flashing vs. steady-green lights, shows issues such as the "yellow trap" amongst others, can be overcome through a more understandable display and a less complicated phasing plan.

A portion of their report focus on measures of average response time for various signal systems and phases. In general, it was determined that response time was generally lower for the flashing permissive indications. Furthermore, "a trend in average response time by age was very evident as drivers over the age of 65 took between 2 and 4 sec of additional time to respond when compared with drivers under the age of 24" [17]. This is likely attributed to the effects of dementia associated with aging.

Their research also includes crash data analysis left-tum crash rates associated with field traffic conflicts for PPLT displays. Observed traffic events were categorized by four potential left-turning conflicts types, Figure 2.4), namely: · · · · Type l--opposing left-turn conflicts; Type 2-left-turnlsame direction conflicts; Type 3-left-turnllane change conflicts; and Type 4-secondary conflicts, such as those involving a pedestrian or bicyclist or resulting from a lane overflow. (see diagrams in

A total of 11 hours of data were collected at each of the 24 study intersections for a total of 264 hours of observation time. During the observation period, the research team observed approximately 2,000 vehicles; of which 5,000 were leftturn vehicles; and 17,000 were through vehicles [17]. A summary of the observed quantities for each type are shown in Figure 2.5.

Figure 2.S: PPLT Field Conflicts

From this study, there were several important findings, namely:

- 29-

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

·

Most left-turn conflicts were related to hesitation at the onset of the green indication;

·

Aggressive driving appeared to be the major cause of Type 1 conflicts. Drivers continued to make left-turn maneuvers during the yellow and all-red phase following the protected left-turn phase and were in conflict with the opposing through traffic.

·

Type 2 conflicts were primarily the result of a driver's hesitating to tum left on the left-turn permissive indication. The sudden hesitation would cause a conflict with following vehicles. There appeared to be a relationship between the driver's understanding of the permissive circular green indication and the observed Type 2 conflicts;

·

The few Type 3 conflicts were a result of driver error and not the lack of understanding of the PPLT signal display; and

·

·

There were no Type 4 conflicts observed.

In addition

~o

field conflicts, classifications for "Traffic Events"

paralleling the four conflict events were:

· · · ·

Type 1: Driver hesitating on the left-turn protected indication; Type 2: Driver hesitating on the left-turn permissive indication; Type 3: Driver going through the circular red indication; and Type 4: Driver backing a vehicle out of the intersection, back into the left-turn lane.

The largest occurrence of Type 1 traffic events involved a fivesection horizontal PPLT signal display arrangement. The

simultaneous illumination of the green arrow and the circular red indicatjons appeared to increase the workload of the driver, resulting in an increase in driver uncertainty. · Type 2 traffic events were observed at each of the study intersections. The occurrence did not appear to be related to the PPLT signal arrangement or phasing or indication. · Numerous drivers were observed proceeding through the all-red indication (i.e., red light runners). Therefore, Type 3 traffic events were recorded only when the action was clearly a function of driver misunderstanding. For this reason, only five Type 3 events were recorded, and the occurrences showed no pattern to suggest an influence of the PPLT signal display, indication, or phasing.

- 31 -

·

33 Type 4 events were associated with a flashing permissive indication. The driver would enter the intersection during the permissive phase and not have the opportunity to make the left-turn maneuver. The driver would then choose to back up.

Another portion of the above mentioned study involved a "Crash Data Analysis", where selected components of a crash database created in 1988 as part of a FHWA study were examined through comparisons of left-turn crash rates associated with various PPLT signal displays. This initiative was sparked by the past "inadequate documentation of causes of a crash related to traffic signal display and operation" [17]. Traffic volumes, signal display information, and 3 years' of crash data for the study intersections (the same intersections studied in the operational study and the conflict study) were evaluated in the crash analysis. General findings on the use of PPLT signals for intersections with left-turning vehicles include: · leading protected left-turn phasing has the lowest crash rate (as compared with lagging protection; · · · · vehicle delay decreases; fuel usage decreases; vehicle progression is improved; and vehicle crashes increase.

- 32-

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

As the number of left-turning vehicles increase, average delay and accident potential for both through and left-turning vehicles increase [17].

The report shows a relationship exists between driver's understanding of signal systems and its effect on safety. A focus on the weaknesses associated with left-turns at intersections is made with "conflicts" and "traffic events" as key indicators. There are a number of limitations associated with their

methodology. The narrow classifications used for the four "conflicts" and four "traffic events" do not account for other situatiohs, nor for other confounding factors. For instance, the duration of each of the traffic events varies, as the amount of available time for each of the classes (i.e., hesitating on the left-turn permissive indication; vs. going through the circular red indication) differs .

·

Also, traffic way volumes are not explicitly accounted for either. This may bear particular significance as individual jurisdictions may have their own specifications (i.e., minimum left-turning volumes, etc.) that call for particular signal systems to be used. Furthermore, there are a handful of issues associated with using crash rates as a measure of safety, such as: · Regression-to-mean or bias-by-selection effect must be accounted for, otherwise over-estimation of the effectiveness of any condition or treatment may result. In fact, some situations with high crash rates may have fewer crashes in subsequent periods, even if no treatment is carried out; · and

The use of the crash rates to compare the safety 'before ' and 'after' or 'with' and 'without' a treatment, leads to a paradox; by comparing crash rates one

- 33-

would be led to the incorrect conclusion about which selected site is safer, or whether a treatment helps or impairs safety. This paradoxical result stems from the fact that the crash rates fails to separate the effect of traffic flow on safety from the effect of a treatment on safety. In fact, when safety is improved from a given treatment, the expected crash rate may actually increase. This kind of error will be present always when the relationship between crash frequency and traffic flow is not a straight line through the origin [18]. To remedy this, crash frequency should be used instead of crash rates. Using crash frequency avoids this kind of error through modifying the crash frequency.

An interesting limitation of their study found throughout the report was their failure to measure influences of the intersection geometry. They reasoned that · this is "could not be measured because the study simulated only exclusive leftturn lane configurations" [17].

Another weakness shows "in the aggregate, the crash analysis findings ... did not perform consistently within a selection of four crash statistics. The ranking of one crash statistic [observed conflicts] did not match that of another crash statistic [traffic events]" [17]. Also, the results of the crash rate analysis and the conflict study had no correlation in rank ordering. This poor synchronicity certainly reduces confidence in their findings.

Findings and oversights from the literature reviewed above have been incorporated and considered where possible in this report.

2.4 Summary of Literature Review
In general, findings from the literature reviewed point to a number of methods for the analysis of collision data, including side-impact collisions. The use of logistic regression and statistical programs is superior to simple summary statistics and crude odds ratios (COR). In addition, odds ratios (OR) are most
.c

typically deemed statistically significant and publishable when criteria for P <

0.05.

A number of significant factors in collision involvement have been shown to . appear in past research as human, vehicle and environmental factors emerged. Also, the range of variables available and used in the reviewed studies differed from study to study, but commonalities exist where driver, vehicle and environmental factors are essential. The fact that certain factors are absent in particular studies is disheartening, and it must be stressed that great importance lies in the availability and inclusion of all relevant factors for a worthwhile analysis. It has been revealed that great advantages lie in the linking of separate data sets, as the linking process allows an in-depth analysis of severity and outcome of injury, providing a wider picture of the effects of crashes with any particular collision. Chapter 3.0 expands on this idea of the data linking process used to construct a database. - 35 -

3 Development Of a Collision Database for In-Depth study of Side Impact Collisions

I ,

3.1 General
In order to fully benefit and accommodate an analysis of collision data with
experts in multiple disciplines, all available Toronto data-sets were linked together. Catering to each specialized expert is accomplished through the

accumulation and linkage of data-sets containing vehicle, driver and environmental information. Talents for each expert are harnessed in this way. This chapter focuses on the Toronto data sources available and those used to develop a database for further multi-disciplinary research efforts.

Within The City of Toronto, there are a number of official documents that are used to record collision information, as follows:

·

Ontario Ministry of Transportation Motor Vehicle Accident Reports (MVAs) (Figure 3.1) and accompanying investigating officer field notes

·

Ministry of Transportation Self Reporting Collision Reports (Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3)

·

Transport Canada Vehicle Safety Research Team Collision Investigation Reports (Booklet, Appendix A)

In addition to these documents, Transport Canada's Vehicle Safety Research Teams have access to VIN (vehicle identification number) code reading software, which can be used in combination with vehicle VIN's to obtain important characteristics such as vehicle mass, weight distributions, and other dimensions.

Also, it was decided that provisions exist for "control vehicles" as part of the linked-data set. This is discussed in the following sections.

In order to develop a superior and unique database, it is proposed that all of the above available data sources are merged together, as shown in Figure 3.4.

In many instances, symptoms of these injuries will not occur immediately. Instead they may take up to 72 hours to manifest themselves. Some of the common symptoms for the injuries include headache, blurred vision, loss of taste, smell, or hearing, blood in urine or stool, swelling, loss of motion to the area/stiffness/tightness and more [2].

As a result, deaths and injury severity may still be underestimated for a variety of reasons. These are discussed in the Limitations section of this report.

3.3 Ministry of Transportation Self Reporting Collision Reports
Due to the large frequency of motor vehicle collisions combined with the limited resources of investigating Police Forces, officers are limited to the investigation of collisions at the scene when there is at least some injury component defined in four categories as:

1. Minor: person did not go to hospital when leaving the scene of the accident. Includes minor ,abrasions, bruises and complaint of pain. 2. Minimal: person went to hospital and was treated in the emergency room but not admitted. 3. Major: person admitted to hospital. Includes person admitted for observation.

4. Fatal: person killed immediately or within 30 days of the motor vehicle crash. [20]

To account for the limited police resources, partnerships between government (police), Insurance Providers and private enterprise have developed a solution; Collision Self-Reportfng Centres. The concept of Self Reporting of collisions

is the main function of the Collision Reporting Centre (CRC). Drivers involved in property damage collisions report within 24 hours to the CRC where a police officer inspects the vehicle damage. Here, drivers themselves complete a

simplified version of a collision form that is checked by a police officer [21].

Under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act [22], when one is in a collision in which there is only property damage (no injury or death, and, among other conditions, no criminal activities such as impaired driving) the involved person(s) may report the collision immediately by proceeding with one's vehicle to a Collision Reporting Centre. Self-reporting of a collision was introduced on January 1, 1997 [23]. (There are other requirements, such as a $1000 minimum reportable level for property damage only collision, but these bear no significance to this report and are not discussed.) Immediately, digital pictures are taken and a -/ CRC sticker is permanently attached to indicate that the damage has been reported. A great benefit of this process is its quick resolving nature and the convenience it affords to the typical driver through the 24 hour grace period. This service is free of charge to motorists as it is funded in part through insurance companies is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Further improvements in CRCs are well underway, particularly through electronic claims reporting Web-based software. For example, Allianz Canada successfully completed the first ever pilot project on February 19th , 2003. A motor vehicle accident report has been electronically submitted from North York Accident Support Services Ltd., one of Toronto's three CRCs, directly to Allianz Canada's Toronto claims office. Allianz believes that having the driver record and submit the data themselves can save duplicate work typical of this type, in addition to doing the work of what would have otherwise been an employee.

3.4 Transport Canada Vehicle Safety Research Team Collision Investigation Reports
Through the Government of Canada, the Road Safety and Motor Vehicle Regulation of Transport Canada has a mandate to contribute to a
r~duction

in

deaths, injuries, and property damage resulting from motor vehicle use, through improved safety of the motor vehicles.

Transport Canada satisfies this through five areas of activity, including: 1. Directed studies Investigations 2. Defect Investigations 3. Special Investigations 4. Community Involvement and Education

5. Professional Development

Of particular importance are the Directorate's established Directed Studies Investigations and Special Investigations. These investigations consist of indepth and impartial analysis of collisions where multi-disciplinary research teams are established typically working out of Universities. The term "Multidisciplinary" indicates that the members of the teams are either full-time staff or consultants hailing from a diverse group of professions. Scientists. Engineers. Physicians, Coroners, Psychologists, Police dfficers and other specialists. scientifically analyze motor vehicle collision data to determine vehicle crashworthiness and injury causation. Subsequently, the teams recommend to the Directorate imRrovements to the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) or the need for new standards. Included in their in depth

investigations are many fields relating to crush, injuries, estimated speeds, injury sources and more. These and other forms from their investigations are attached in Appendix A. These forms are completed through vehicle. occupant and scene inspections conducted by their team of experts, often followed with occupant and investigating police officer interviews.

Vehicle interiors are investigated to determine the dynamics of occupant and vehicle contact. Interior vehicle environment and particularly safety features are also thoroughly examined and recorded. Features such as air bags. seat belts, seat back structure and roof strength are examined to determine their

usage and effectiveness in a collision. Through confidential communication with the occupants and other confidential sources (i.e., medical treatment records, coroner, police, witness, etc.,) further information is determined. After harvesting this information, the sensitive components are purged from their files upon completion of the case in order to ensure anonymity of those involved. Also performed are collision scene inspections "measuring skid marks, fluid spills and gouges".

Aside from the large amount of detailed collision information this source provides, the team members that conduct the investigation are typically more specialized in collision investigation, as compared to police officers and the self-reporting public. In fact, members of these teams have offered seminars and other collision investigation training to police dep,artments. Included in their reports is output from two programs, namely, VIN ASSIST, and Canadian Vehicle Specifications. These programs decipher VIN numbers of involved vehicles and output characteristics such as vehicle mass, weight distributions, height, width, and more. A notably important field is the seventeen character Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). This is a unique code that is found on all motor vehicles. It has been recognized by Transport Canada as an important field. Identifying a vehicle for detailed investigation is best achieved through its VIN. Ideally the VIN of each vehicle involved would be part of a police report. This will be potentially reliable when electronic readers are practical and widely available.

Electronic readers are becoming widely used, as many emission testing facilities in Toronto are scanning VIN codes located on vehicle pillars for easy tracking.

3.5 Control Investigations and Form Creation
Experts involved in this research project insisted on obtaining additional information for the database from "control vehicles". (This is useful for

comparisons and contrasts in order to determine what factors differ form collision and non-collision experiencing vehicles, drivers and environments.) To date, Transport Canada has not performed this before. It was decided that

I
\
\

collecting additional information by returning to collision scenes at the same hour, seven days after the collision, to note traffic and weather conditions and to select control vehicles traveling at the crash scene would generate useful information about non-crashing vehicles.

."

'I

i

It was proposed that the license plates of control vehicles be used to determine the VIN numbers and driver's names and addresses, (assuming registered owner's are driver's). Through government resources, this information is

available, although it is guarded. For a marginal fee, vehicle history searches can be completed online through the Ministry of Transportation Online Services (http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/englishldandv/catalogue.htm). In addition, Ontario Private Driver and Vehicle License Issuing Offices also offer this service.

.

Road safety statistics experts would argue that this report's focus is in fact that of a comparison group and not a control group. Hauer supports the notion that "when the assignment to treatment is 'at random', it is legitimate to speak of a 'statistical experiment' which involves a 'control group'" [24].

r
Despite efforts to select control vehicles at random, controlling for day of week, time of day, and day of year was possible, but not other fields such as weather. Thus, despite any efforts, this study never had a true control group, since regardless of the size, as "even if both entities are very large, they will differ systematically with respect to some casual factors" [24]. It should be noted that vehicles were not selected entirely at random. In fact, control vehicles are

selected with a ratio of 4: 1, four control vehicles per case vehicle, respectively, (with the intention of sending drivers surveys at a later date). Furthermore, since the study's focus is on late model vehicles, efforts have been made at control scenes to collect only relatively late model vehicles (defined as 1998 and newer) traveliqg in target and bullet vehicle directions.

"In contrast, when the assignment of entities to the treatment group is not made at random, then ... they will differ systematically with respect to some causal factors" [24]. In part, a goal of this report is to identify and quantify these systematic differences between case and control vehicles, with consideration of driver fault. Finally, for the reasons explained above, the term "control" shall be replaced with "comparison" throughout the remainder of this report.

The construction of the control investigation forms followed the format provided by Transport Canada's Vehicle Safety Research Teams Collision Investigation Fields. When composing these forms, field selection was carefully

matched with as similar as possible a manner. ensures easily comparable results.

Having comparable fields

Furthermore, additional fields were recorded for use in analysis other than the comparison group type. Provisions to accommodate signal timing, sight

distance, approximate vehicle speeds, volume counts, and more were created and included. The completed forms are attached to the Vehicle Safety Research Teams Collision Investigation Booklet in Appendix C.

3.6 Database Creation for Data on All Available Forms
Ideally, all possible fields recorded about a particular collision would be of greatest benefit to researchers and analysts. However, this is often unpractical as it would seem natural for collisions of particularly minor severities to be given less attention and detail than those of a more serious nature.

Regardless, using the commonalities that exist between all motor vehicle collisions, and even between the three
diffe~ent

collision report forms found in

Ontario, the link of them into one all encompassing and all inclusive data set increases its potential for analysis. Also, great potential exists in making them compatible with one another, such that fields for the common data (i.e., weather conditions, match piecemeal with variable numbers). Difficulties in this process arose when conflicts between identical fields (such as weather conditions) had differing options. For instance, Transport Canada's field for "Weather

Condition", contains class "3 - Raining", while the MV A report's corresponding "Environment Condition" class "3 - Snow" differs, yet other classes are matched exactly. Although many parallels exist with the available variables, this was a tedious and time-consuming process.

For this report, a database has been constructed that meets this requirement,

1

and is essentially all encompassing and far more complete than anyone of the existing three collision data collection schemes. The similar nature of many of the data fields found in the explained three report types required decisions to be made as to the prioritizing of data.

For instance, the l?olice reported collision severity may differ from the results of , the interview performed with the occupant several days later. Often injuries may be discovered after the initial excitement of a collision. At times, the body tries to stop these signals by creating chemicals that help block pain signals. These chemicals, called endorphins, are morphine-like painkilling substances that decrease the pain sensation. [25] Afterwards, soreness may appear days later, where occupants then seek medical treatment. One example of the triggering mechanism behind endorphin release is one's own thoughts and emotions. For example, a father who is driving his children is hurt in a car accident. He is so worried about his children that he doesn't feel the pain of his own broken arm. The concern for his children has caused the natural release of endorphins, which block the pain signal and prevent him from noticing the pain.

As explained earlier in this report, different formats for similar data from the multiple sources of data existed. In such cases, the format from the most reliable source was adopted. More specifically, reliability was based on a

combination of considerations. Typically, investigating officers are first to arrive immediate at scene, so fields such as road surface environmental condition, weather and illumination are taken from their reports. However, other non-time sensitive information such as pre- and post-collision vehicle positions, target and bullet vehicle actions, etc, are recorded from the Vehicle Safety Research Team investigations. The synopsis composed by summation of hours of work by the Research Teams for each collision held the highest regard as an information source for each collision. As a result, fields from MVA reports, self reports and Vehicle Safety Research Teams , were all incorporated. The size of the generated linked spreadsheet initially contained over 3000 observations. From this, carefully selected factors have been selected from the data sets and are discussed and used for regression modeling in the following chapters. The shall provide researchers insight on the selected collisions, as it exists as a preliminary investigation based on currently available linked-data using methods derived from the literature review in Chapter 2.

Preliminary Investigation of Toronto Police Reported Side Impact Collisions - Research Approach

4.1 General
This chapter describes the data and methodology used for the preliminary analyses 1 and 2, with data available from MVA reports and electronic intersection data files, respectively. Using electronically available data and

through several linked data sets, 1~35 signalized intersections for years 19982000 inclusive within the City of Toronto were analyzed to identify factors affecting intersections with collisions vs. those without. In addition, 1718 motor vehicle accident reports representing 1466 motor vehicle collisions (as there are frequently mUltiple MV A reports per collision) were selected and further scrutinized manually to identify only the side impact collisions. These

collisions were linked with the intersection data and analyzed too. The results of this report's research efforts illustrate the usefulness of using linked data sets to perform analysis, as mentioned in the literature review section. Individually, each data set could not provide the degree of insight and depth that has been afforded only through this linking process. As mentioned earlier, there are multiple sources of data. These are merged into only two databases and are used for two analyses (see Figure 4.1: Data for the Two Separate Analysis).

Throughout the hypothesis testing process, error has traditionally been quantified through classifications of Type 1 and 2. Type 1 errors are those that arise from rejecting what is true. Existing as a measure of probability, Type I error is designated by the Greek letter alpha (a) and is called the Type I error rate. The smallest error probability this report has allowed itself to accept is 5%, thereby fixing a at 0.05. With this said, rejecting what is true is henceforth fixed at a maximum of 0.05. "Statistical significance", P, is defined by this concept and its value throughout this report. P can be defined as the probability of a more extreme absolute value than the observed value if the true value was zero or null.

\

This differs from a Type 2 error, where accepting what is false occurs. Designated by the Greek letter beta
(~),

\
\,

this error rate is only an error in the

I \

sense that an opportunity to reject the null hypothesis correctly was lost. It is not an error in the sense that an incorrect conclusion was drawn since no conclusion is drawn when the null hypothesis is not rejected.

\
\

I~
In summary, this paper strives to determine the salient factors that cause a defined response, (either fault or collision occurrence, as in analysis 1 and 2, respectively). The null hypothesis assumes that there is not even a single

significant predictor. The alternate hypothesis assumes that there is at least one, possibly even many.

Linear regression is a common way of studying relationships between a dependent variable and independent factor(s). Since the independent variables in this study are not linear, a more appropriate method, namely logistic regression, is used.

4.2 Logits and Odds Ratios
There are statistical computing learning resources provided by the University of California, Los Angelos, (UCLA) [26] that provide a great explanation of the intimate relationship between the coefficients produced by logit and the odds ratios produced by logistic. In this explanation, a logit defined as the log base e (log) of the odds, logit(p-) =log(odds) =log(p/q)

[J]

(4.5)

Logistic regression is explained as simply ordinary regression using a logit response or outcome variable as the response variable,

. t

[2]

logit(p) =a + bX

(4.6)

or

[3]

log(p/q)

=a + bX

(4.7)

I

i

This means that the coefficients in logistic regression are in terms of the log odds, that is, the coefficient 1.69 implies that a one unit change in gender results in a 1.69 unit change in the log of the odds.
- 61-

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

Equation [3] can be expressed in odds by eliminating the log. This is done by taking "e" to the power for both sides of the equation.
p/q = e a + bX

[4]

(4.8)

The end result of all the mathematical manipulations is that the odds ratio can be computed by raising e to the power of the logistic coefficient, OR =e b =e1.69 == 5.44

[5]

(4.9)

When reading odds, it is important to recognize that an odds value on its own has little meaning. For instance, if the eldest graduate student cohort's odds of passing a thesis defense was 3, this shows promise that the odds are favourable for success for members of this cohort. However, whether the odds are 3, or 4 or for that matter 10, one can only draw similarly vague "favourably successful" conclusions.

\
\

In order to produce more meaningful and comparable results, comparisons to

I\

other cohorts for passing a thesis defense c,ould be, made. Odds determined from the other younger cohorts could be compared using odds ratios calculated against a given base group. For comparisons against the eldest cohort, the base group would be selected as this eldest cohort and similarly for other comparisons. Throughout the results Chapter of this report, odds ratios are determined with base group rows highlighted. These can also be easily

4.3 Logistic Analysis
Logistic regression was carried out in this analysis through SAS's GENMOD procedure. Although the typical logistic regression in SAS would use the

LOGISTIC procedure, this was not ideal for this study since; the data in this report contained categorical (classification) and character explanatory variables. In fact, using the. LOGISTIC procedure requires explanat@ variables to be numeric. and cannot easily accept categorical variables as they are.
It is

possible that LOGISITC could have been used. However a significant amount additional coding to convert and essentially construct indicator variables in advance would be required. Furthermore, this process often results in too few observations per parameter for the necessary sample size and is not appropriate for these statistics. TJ'lese limitations are overcome through the GENMOD procedure, and in particular through its provision of a class statement, as explained later, for specifying categorical (classification) variables. The

GENMOD procedure can fit logistic regression models for response data using

Consider the relationship of a dichotomous outcome variable to a set of explanatory variables. Such situations can arise from clinical trials where the explanatory variables are treatments, stratification variables, and background covariables; another common source of such analyses are observational studies where the explanatory variables represent factors for evaluation and background variables [28].

The model for 8, the probability of an event, can be specified as follows [28]:

This paper uses a generalized linear model by choosing an appropriate link function and response distribution. In the classical linear model, the probability distribution is the normal and the link function is the identity: g(9)

=9.

For

logistic regression, the distribution is the binomial and the link function is the logit which is linear [27]:

An advantage of using a logit to link the predictors to the outcome is that it transforms an unrestricted interval to a restrctied interval [0,1] (the probability). This is the essence of why GENMOD uses this link function - to link the binary

outcome variable to a probability based on the effects of a set of essentially unrestricted independent variables (/3n).

GENMOD uses Newton-Raphson algorithms. These algorithms are commonly accepted by statisticians as computing standard errors that are more conservative than those yielded with other procedures. When using the class statement in PROC GENMOD, the qualitative explanatory variables listed generate a model matrix. Parameterizations of these variables throughout this analysis are incrementally estimated for all levels. By default, SAS utilizes the last level within a class as a reference. Using features such as CONTRAST allows user-defined customized estimates. Throughout this paper, the

CONTRAST statement was used to make more relevant comparisons, provided that a given parameter was statistically significant. ,Details on this and more are covered in the following analysis-focusing sections, complimented with actual programming used for this thesis.

4.3.1 Exclusion of Intercepts
In almost all types of modeling, an intercept is a typical part of the model and is
almost always significantly different from zero. For every model constructed,
SAS by default tests whether this parameter is equal to zero. If the intercept

\,

were zero (equivalent to having no intercept in the model), the resulting model implies that the response function must be exactly zero when all the predictors are set to zero. For an ordinary regression model this means that the mean of the -66-

response variable is zero. For a logistic model it means that the logit (or log odds) is zero, which implies that the event probability is 0.5. This is a very strong assumption that is sometimes reasonable, but more often is not. So, a highly significant intercept in a model is generally not a problem. By the same token, if the intercept is not significant, it is not a good idea to remove it from the model because this could create a model that says that the response function must be zero when the predictors are all zero.

Since the nature of this report's models are based on outcomes of fault and intersection collision propensity, the intercept need not be zero. In this case, modeling is such that removal of the intercept is not required, but note that there is essentially no meaning in this intercept. For the intersection modeling, the intercept is a misnomer, because it gives the odds of intersections having collisions which is not as useful since continuous covariates are included. For instance, since some of the covariates used were presence of FAG, presence of SCOOT, and roadway volume, then the predicted odds of the intersection collision propensity. would be for those intersections without FAG, without SCOOT, and with a roadway volume of O. Should it be decided that the

constants be removed, SAS has several automatic procedures for this.

The intercept can be useful though, provided that the predictor levels were

constructed in a different manner. Any category may be chosen as the reference category, but the results might be easier to interpret if you choose the one that

has the lowest proportion on the outcome variable. In such cases of logistic modeling, the intercept would have little practical value in itself, but could still be useful for reconstruction of probabilities of injury for specific groups.

Values of intercepts determined from the models developed in this report can be found in Appendix E: Model Output.

4.4 Analysis 1: MVA Reported Collisions
The data used were three years (1998-2000) of accident data from the City of Toronto Traffic Data Centre and Safety Bureau.

Through descriptive fields selected from Ontario Motor Vehicle Accident Report Forms, collisions meeting particular criteria were selected. Inclusion criteria included: · accident location at intersections or at least reported intersection related; · · a traffic signal exists at the collision scene; the class of accident involves a minimum of some injury component reported at the scene; · · at least one vehicle involved was turning left; and, the collision resulted in a side impact with two passenger vehicles.

The focus on this report is on passenger vehicles and their interactions. Therefore, collisions involving trucks, busses, streetcars, motorcycles, pedestrians, cyclists, horses and other road users were excluded.

~,

I

Other excluded collisions are: · · · · those "not investigated at scene"; not side impact; those with poles; and, hit and runs due to lack of information.

From these data, collision reports were printed and manually further scrutinized to ensure only collisions resulting in a side impact existed. Furthermore, when no clear identification differentiating target and bullet vehicle could be made, the collision was excluded from the study altogether.

One could argue that this is an entire population, since it includes all collisions meeting the above criteria for the specified time interval. However, under a stricter sense, the statistical community would consider this claim as having external validity issues. This research paper shall not
e~plore

external validity

issues in-depth but shall instead carefully state limitations of data and analysis with respect to results. Without being sidetracked with comprehensive

discussions on statistical issues such as external validity, one should recognize that in this case, missing elements and entire observations may be a result of

- 69'fiv.1

other confounding factors which give rise to these issues (of external validity). Examples in this research effort's data could consist of poor recording/absence of detailed scene and collision information at large, complicated intersections, when weather conditions are adverse. Please refer to the section on Limitations in this paper, where the existence of these and other issues are recognized.

For this analysis, the MVA source collision data was used in a different capacity than Analysis I. Since the MVA report's data is based on the existence of a collision and not aggregated by intersection collision frequencies ,this data can be considered
dis~ggregate.

As a result, merging data into the linked

spreadsheet (as discussed in the above section covering Analysis I) invoked the use of a similar key with "Duplicates" permitted. For each collision, the city identifying "PX" label was manually entered and· set as "key" for linking spreadsheets electronically. This enabled intersection data to merge with MVA report data.

The spreadsheet formed from the data

on the selected MVA reports

was entered manually and is explained in the two following sections.

warrants. Collisions exist where both drivers are at-fault, neither drivers are atfault, and combinations within. The modeling methodology used in the analysis takes this into account, and does not necessarily rule out collisions falling outside of the classic ideal of a single driver at-fault coupled with another driver not-at-fault.

Ontario's Statutes and Regulations as

Regulation 668 made under the Insurance Act [29] provide a

comprehensive document on Fault Determination Rul.es. The regulation states that "an insurer shall deterinine the degree of fault of its insured for loss or damage arising from the use or operation of an automobile in accordance with these rules". Interestingly, the degree of fault (of an insured) is determined

without regard to:

·

The circumstances in which the incident occurs, including weather conditions, road conditions, visibility or the actions of pedestrians; or

·

The location on the insured's automobile of the point of contact with any other automobile involved in the incident [29];

·

Independently of charges laid by a police officer. A charge under the Highway Traffic Act does not necessarily mean that the person charged was "at fault". In the same way, a lack of charges does not mean that the person was "not at fault" [30].

I

The regulation illustrates some twenty types of accidents occurring on public highways, and sets out rules dealing with intersection accidents, accidents in parking lots and other matters. In each case the rule specifies the degree of fault to be assessed against each driver. The following excerpt specific to this report and its signalized intersection focus was taken from this Regulation 668,
276/90, Section 15 [29]:
\

·

This section applies with respect to an incident that occurs at an intersection with traffic signals.

·

If the driver of automobile "B" fails to obey a traffic signal, the driver of automobile "A" is not at fault and the driver of automobile liB" is 100 per cent at fault for the incident.

·

If it cannot be established whether the 'driver of either automobile failed to obey a traffic signal, the driver of each automobile shall be deemed to be 50 per cent at fault for the incident.

·

If the traffic signals at the intersection are inoperative, the

degree of fault of the drivers shall be determined as if the intersection were an all-way stop intersection.

Furthermore, Rules for Automobiles Traveling in Opposite Directions also bear a direct relevance to this side impact study, and are summarized from the Regulations as:

If the location on the road of automobiles "A" and "B" when the incident (a "sideswipe") occurs (see Figure 4.2) cannot be determined, the driver of each automobile is 50 per cent at fault for the incident.

Other examples include "Rules for automobiles travefing in the same direction in adjacent lanes". This section applies when automobile "A" collides with automobile "B", and both automobiles are traveling in the same direction in adjacent lanes.

If the incident occurs when automobile "A" is turning left at an intersection and

automobile "B" is overtaking automobile "A" to pass it, the driver of automobile "A" is 25% at fault and the driver of automobile "B" is 75% at fault for the incident.

The Fault Determination Rules are comprehensive and lengthy, but are not fully discussed in this report. As a whole, the Fault Determination Rules referred to above were followed for this study. Regardless, in every collision, it came down to a human decision, which is subject to error and bias. Following the fault determination rules helped to provide some degree of consistency and is recommended for future use.

Through screening collisions, driver statements, investigating officer opinions, directions of travel, vehicle maneuvers, driver actions, driver conditions and witness accounts (where available) as appearing on motor vehicle accident reports, collision reports, and investigating officer's field notes, were reviewed and faults assessed. These same sources and an identical procedure were

employed to differentiate between the target and bullet vehicle. When no clear indication of either being at fault or not at fault existed, the fault observation was left blank. Two variables created, namely DIF and D2F, served as flags for fault for target and bullet vehicle, respectively. There are included in the input statement as labeled in Figure 4.6. For consistency, the designation 1 and 2 has been assigned to variables where identification of target and bullet vehicle, respectively, is required. For instance, the notation "2" found on the fault

outcome variable "D2F" indicates bullet, and an identical model for target "1" was also formulated.

Independent variables are the individual factors that can be defined as circumstances contributing to a result (the dependent variable).

As discussed earlier, the prime source of data in this analysis was derived from MV A reports. These reports contained a wide range of variables available

existing in many forms; Discrete; continuous; integer; ordinal; nominal; and non-integer data included. For a comprehensive listing of the variables found in the MVA report see Appendix B.

Existence of entry immediately adjacent to intersection (0,1); Intersection perpendicularity (0,1); and

Note: for the above three actions, distinctions were made for target and bullet in all cases, where applicable.

Clearly, having this data electronically included from the start would be ideal, particularly since it is already recorded; however, police data entry resources are limited. This process of building on existing data is similar to the method used [31] where a review of'each report was undertaken to create essentially more data fields that indicate characteristics about a collision that were previously uncoded yet apparent from scanning scene diagrams.

The analysis of Target and Bullet vehicles was performed separately, so that comparisons could ultimately be made between the two. For each of these

analysis, at fault vs. not at-fault was the dichotomous dependent outcome variable. The tendency of certain predictor factors being attributed to any of these groups provides insight into differences and commonalities between them but must properly be interpreted.

A mix of different data types exist in the above fields, including:

· B5 Two possible values, the higher value indicates "true" or
"present", the lower value signifying "no" or "absent". Throughout this report 1 and 0 are used, respectively. · Nominal: Integer codes with no logical sequence. These codes could be used to identify safety equipment used, Driver Action, etc. · Ordinal: Integer codes having a logical sequence. One such example is injury severity, ranging from 0, none to 4, fatal. · Continuous: Continuous scale (Le., Driver's age).

It was intended to compare the binary fault outcome for both target and bullet

for each collision.

Ideally, one could expect JO find statistically proven

differences between target and bullet drivers by fault. Throughout the analysis, contrasts are made between classes of binary, nominal and ordinal predictors.

Using hardcopy printouts from the collision reports, in addition to data obtained

from the other sources mentioned, the data was entered in MS Excel 2002 as a collection of records. A Pentium 260,088 KB RAM 1.80 GHz CPU computer was used throughout the analysis.

At this point, a "run" statement follows.

After careful examination of the data, it became evident that distinctions could be made between driver, vehicle and environmental factors. Since comparisons by dichotomous fault outcome for Target and Bullet vehicles were desired, SAS required a framework for this logistic type modeling.

For modeling purposes, a meaningful model doe.s not simply include all available variables together and hope for statistically significant results to appear. The benefits of using multiple models for collision data analysis as opposed to a single model are generally accepted. A recent paper found that additional models were advantageous due to it being not possible to account in the model for all the factors that cause differences in accident potential (e.g. weather, geometries) [32]. With this in mind, careful selection of variables based on findings from past research was used as a basis for initial consideration of variables within model selection.

Recall that PROC GENMOD is a procedure for fitting a somewhat wider range of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and differs in that the sampling distribution of the dependent variable may be specified as binomial (amongst selected others); and the links between the expected value or probability of Y and the linear additive function of X may be: logistic (amongst selected others). For binary data, these models operate to predict a function of the mean probability of occurrence for all cases having the same scores on X. The outcome for each case is assumed to be from an independent binomial "experiment" (each line of the'SAS input used for this study reads in this manner). The expected value of the distribution of the dependent variable (which is binary) is the probability of one of the two outcomes, where the models are predicting the probability of a given (summed up) score in anyone trial, conditional on the predictor variables. In this case, the

X variables are treated as a linear additive function (i.e. y =a + !3tXt + I1X 2 + ... !3I1Xn). Like other linear models, it is possible to transform or link the X's in
any way (so long as it remains linear in the b parameters) and include interactions. Unlike classical linear models, the link function may be any of the exponential family distributions (such as binomial) and the link function may be any monotonic differentiable function, (such as logit) [33]. That is, the shape of the curve that relates the predicted score on X (that is, the sum or !3iXj) to the expected value of outcome, y.

For the purposes of this research, human factors depend on the individual attributes of driver's and are very limited in number. Fields such as seatbelt use, proper license to drive class of vehicle, driver's license class, age, vehicle speed, passengers etc., are generally accepted to be of interest in such a study. Of these variables, only a select few were included in the initial model as shown in Figure 4.8. For instance, driver injury was excluded, since it is an outcome of a collision and an after-effect not clearly foreseeable prior to the collision.

by the abbreviated variable names MV A34, MV A36, D2SEX, D2AGE, V2PIAGE, V20CCUP, V2PISEX and D2LIC, the predictors included in this model were driver action, driver condition, driver gender, driver age, front passenger age, number of occupants, front passenger gender, and driver license class, respectively. (These variables were selected as predictors for the model testing based on literature reviewed on findings in other reports, as outlined in this reports chapter 2-literature review, subject to availability within the used data.) The "class" statement can be combined with the "type3" setting to

the model. When a Type 3 analysis is requested, PROC GENMOD produces a table that contains the likelihood ratio statistics, degrees of freedom, and pvalues based on the liffi1ting chi-square distributions for each effect in the model statement [34].

likelihood ratio statistics for the contrasts or score statistics for GEEs. Wald statistics are computed if the WALD option is also specified. By default,

GENMOD uses a corner point parameterization for categorical variables where the last category of each variable is used as the reference category [35]. One method for specifying a reference category is to define a format for the variable using a space as the first character of the formatted value for all categories

is particularly useful ultimately when constructing desired comparisons for odds ratios.

The "D=bin" text indicates the binomial response probability distribution used. The "link=logit" specifies a logit link function as the means for SAS to link the predictors with the outcome variable, as explained in section 4.3. In addition, the "type3" function was specified in order to take advantage of the likelihood ratio (LR) statistics for the effect of each term in the model through the table shown below in Figure 4.9. Briefly, a Type 3 estimatible function (contrast) for an effect is a linear function of the model parameters that involves the parameters of the effect and any interactions with that effect.
·

A test of

hypothesis that the Type 3 contrast for a main effect is equal to 0 is intended to test the significance of the main effect in the presence of interactions [28]. Note that a Type 3 analysis does not depend on the order in which the terms for the model are specified.

Also included within this feature are various default measures for assessing data fit, as shown in the following Figure 4.10. This is important since once the model is applied, an assessment of how well it fits the data are required. This output includes several tests of overall model adequacy which test the global null hypothesis that none of the independent variables in the model are related to changes in probability of even occurrence.

Two traditional goodness::Qf--fit tests are the Pearson chi-sguare Qp, and the

Tests of the statistical significance of each independent variable are also provided where the criteria displayed are approximate chi-square statistics.

One study discussed in the literature review performed additional chi-square tests or non-parametric tests for each bivariate analysis [14]. In dealing with problematic areas of fit, partial residual plots were used as the evaluation tool. Goodness-of-fit was evaluated by comparing fitted probabilities with observed value of dependent variables within deciles of probability, and calculating the corresponding observed chi-square statistic. In addition, an area under the receiver operator curve for logistic models was calculated to evaluate the models predictive power.

In this report, these additional tests were not explicitly nor manually conducted. However, the goodness of fit statistics described previously and the TYPE 3 function mentioned on the previous page utilizes the Wald test for the interaction terms as a goodness-of-fit test for the main effects model. Odds ratio estimates are all considered
along~ide

in their analysis through 95% Wald

confidence limits. So long as the 95% Wald confidence limits do not contain the value 1, these values are automatically considered significant (see Appendix
E).

This was done to avoid potential limitations occurring with SAS default contrasts, where the where the last category of each variable is used as the reference category, which mayor may not be relevant for comparison purposes. Manually programmed contrasts such as this are used throughout the analysis and are vital to obtaining meaningful results, complete with their statistical significance (p values).

Simply looking at this test, successively higher log likelihoods with advancing model iterations can be a measure of success. Of course, other concepts, (such as estimate magnitudes and polarity) must be simultaneously considered.

In Appendix E, SAS output for all of the models developed in this report are comprehensively shown. A selection of all converging and final models used in this are presented and discussed in the Results Chapter.

To demonstrate the actual regression model evolution process, only the analysis titled "First Model Built for Human Factors: Bullet Vehicle", is explained in full detail. The steps used in this analysis are essentially duplicated for all other models built, which serve as exemplary representation of all logistic modeling using GENMOD in this report.

In this first model, with programming shown in Figure 4.8, there were 624 missing values and 14<1 observations used.

Within 0.75 seconds, SAS calculated the following results (as shown in Figure 4.9):

D2SEX, representing driver gender was not statistically significant . (p=0.965);

·

D2AGE, representing driver age, was found to be statistically significant (p=0.0918);

·

V2P1AGE, representing bullet vehicle front seat passenger age was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.033);

·

V20CCUP, representing number of occupants in the vehicle was not found to be statistically significant (p=O.928);

·

V2P1SEX, representing front passenger gender, was not found to be statistically significant (p=0.512)

·

D2LIC, representing driver license class was not sufficiently statistically significant (p = 0.389)

Computed estimates and magnitudes are for these results and more are shown in Chapter 5. Selection for an evolving second iteration (see Figure 4.12) followed a backwards-stepwise method, were variables were selected based on the results of the first analysis and specifically their calculated p values. "Backwards"

stepwise regression begins with the model including all of the potential

independent variables, and successively eliminates those which cost the least in terms of reduction of the coefficient of determination [36].

Figure 4.12: Second Step of Backwards Stepwise Regression for Bullet "Human" Predictor's Model

The evolution of this model essentially used criteria similar to the automatic version of the LOGISTIC procedure's backwards stepwise selection process. Using this method, elimination for variables selected in the model occurred when the p < 0.05 condition was not met. In this iteration, the least costing predictor in this iteration was V2P 1SEX, since it holds the highest p value with p = 0.857. In three subsequent iterations, D2SEX (p 0.930) and V2PISEX (p

=0.965), V20CCUP (p =
4th iteration) were

removed from the model statement. A 5th and 6th ite;ation (see Figure 4.14: 6th iteration) were also performed. In the 5th iteration, although driver condition met the 0.05 condition, it was removed in this step from the model on account of over-parameterization. The basis for this stems from the eight classes within this predictor, of which only four levels are found in the observable data. Having many predictors and so few observations intuitively outweighs the benefit of including this predictor, as the concern for over-parameterization arises. This predictor was removed in order to avoid this issue.

Realistically. there is no perfect answer just as there is no monopoly of knowledge. The

4'\

5th and 6th iterations produce models that are stable and

converge under SAS's rather stringent type 3 analysis criteria. Perhaps the 6th iteration can be considered superior since it is more composed of predictors with classes having met the P < 0.05 criteria. When further iterations were continued, SAS issued warnings indicating that the model no longer converged. Stripping predictors in this backwards regression can increase propensity to fail algorithm convergence and collapse models. particularly when so few predictors remain and so many other confounding factors are left out. Attempting to use extremely few predictors to model any complex situation is poor practice.

Results from this model and other final converging models are provided in · Chapter 5.

The variables selected having little or no predictive association with "human interaction" and which were used as predictors for the initial "extra-human" regression modeling were represented by the abbreviated variable names RLANES, RMAX, VAPSPD, VBODY, VYEAR, veOL, MVAlO, MVA14, MVA16, MVA18, MVA 20 MVA32 and MVA47, representing number of lanes, maximum posted speed, approximate vehicle speed, body style, vehicle manufacture year, vehicle colour, road character, road surface, road condition, road surface condition, road alignment, road pavement markings and vehicle maneuver, respectively. These variables were selected as predictors for the model testing based on literature reviewed on findings in other reports. as outlined in this reports chapter General literature review. subject to availability within the used data.

Since the outcome variable for this analysis was fault, and the predictors selected here were extra-human, the results of this modeling aimed at finding factors associated with fault that are jus~ teetering beyond the absolute control of drivers. For instance, the vehicle colour may have been chosen prior to the collision which can be considered weakly associated with the absolute control of the driver, at the time of collision. The purpose of this predictor being

modeled in this way would be to determine various colour involvements and propensity in side impact collisions through target and bullet comparisons made.

4.5 Analysis 2: Intersections With and Without Collisions
For the second analysis using intersection data, the Queries tool in Microsoft Access was used to link intersection data in spreadsheet format.

Synchronization of the data fields was maintained through the "key" feature, where in any given spreadsheet at least one variable (and its entire column of records) must be selected as "key". Since the first part of the analysis proposed uses a single dependent variable based on occurrences of collisions at each given intersection, the intersection "PX" identification numbers (as exist in the data sets) were set as key. These ill numbers are unique for intersections within Toronto, and to avoid repetition and other potential errors within the various data sets, all key ID numbers' attributes were set to "indexed" and "No Duplicates". Note that this portion of data is considered aggregate since they are aggregated by intersection number, and accident counts/frequencies.

For the intersection analysis, the dependant outcome variable in this analysis was chosen as the intersections having no collisions of any kind within the three years of available data for left-turn and angle classifications. This included collisions that were property damage only PD~, injury, and fatality.

4.5.1 Dependent Variable
The dependent outcome variable followed a typical binary coding as 0 and 1 for
(1) collision or (0) non-collision experiencing intersection for years 1998, 1999

and 2000.

There were also two other fields provided in the data with flags for collisions with: · · Injuries and fatalities combined; and, injuries exclusively.

combinations may help identify areas of concern for intersection safety. However, these differences are not specifically explored due to the exceedingly small number of fatalities found in the data. As a result, only modeling

From a simplistic summary

perspective, driver gender revealed that males are more inclined to be drivers for both target and bullet vehicles involved in the collisions under study, with OR greater than 1.0 calculated as 1.28 and 1.96 respectively. When target vs bullet vehicles are compared by driver gender, female drivers vs. male drivers yield an OR of 1.53. Simply stated, females in the data sampled appear to have a higher involvement in these collisions as Target drivers. However, under

careful consideration of other predictors from both the target and bullet regression modeling process, this predictor was deemed not statistically feasible for model inclusion ( Pr < 0.05 criteria not met) and was removed in the 4th and 2 nd iterations, respectively (see Appendix D for modeling text and regression output).

Table 5.2: Human Predictors Considered

Driver age was readily available in the collision data used. Ages were grouped into cohorts as shown in Figure 5.1 and the cohorts were chosen following similar formats of ORSAM [23] and the "An Evaluation of Severity And Outcome Of Injury By Type Of Object Struck (First Object Struck Only) for

involvement in the 25-34 cohort. Bullet vehicles appear to have higher odds in the younger 15-24 cohort, which supports the commonly accepted notion of young, inexperienced drivers having high collision involvements. With

growing age, speculation on increased maturity levels and driver experience seem to correspond with lower odds values. occurs in the 65+ cohort. A slight increase in the odds

One might speculate tnat this. is a phenomena

associated directly with decreasing mental and physical abilities that are inevitable with aging. The OR set with the 65+ -base cohort indicates notably lower values for the 15.24 and 45-54 age categories, as compared to all other cohorts. One might speculate that this phenomena could be explained by the most immature and inexperienced nature of the youngest cohort, while this wouldn't apply to the 45-54 cohort. Perhaps experienced drivers feel "too

comfortable" and perceived risk phenomena occur. Furthermore, recall that measures for exposure and other limitations must be considered particularly since certain cohorts may experience significantly different exposures, which are not accounted for completely in the quasi-induced exposure method used in this report.

However, under careful consideration of other predictors from both the target and bullet regression modeling process, driver age was not statistically feasible

for model inclusion (as Pr < 0.05 criteria not met) and was eliminated during the backwards regression process. However, driver age for the bullet vehicle is considered marginally significant since Pr

= 0.074, and through inspection of

the measures afforded by the stringent type 3 analysis in SAS, its continued convergence of the model and improvement in model chi-square statistics, it was decidedly included. The estimate for this predictor as a whole equals 1.03, (equivalent to odds of exp(1.03)

= 2.80)

which is a result that is interpreted

differently from an OR. This estimate is for the predictor as a whole, and not for any class comparison within. As such, only a very general observation can be made on its positive magnitude, which suggests that increasing age is associated positively with being at fault for bullet vehicles. No additional

comments can be legitimately made since statistical significance was not achieved for selected class comparisons within this predictor, but potential for further study of this predictor exists through the construction of different class contrasts, set with different base classes for comparison. It is entirely possible that statistical significance can be discovered within different contrasts for this marginally statistically significant predi~tor.

Figure 5.1: Target and Bullet by Age of ~river Odds

Findings based on the number of occupants for target and bullet vehicles revealed both target and bullet vehicles shared similar occupancy rates and showed a similar decreasing trend in Odds with increasing occupancy (Figure

·

5.2). The gross majority of the vehicles (over 60%) had only a single occupant at the time of collision. One possible conclusion drawn from these results would suggest that number of occupants has a beneficial effect since fewer incidences occur with increasing occupancy. However, exposure issues must be considered since situations where number of occupants exceeds a single occupant are likely far less frequent and are not accounted for in this data.

Figure 5.2: Target and Bullet by Number of Occupants Odds

When occupancy was considered in the regression model combined along with all other "human" predictors, the number of occupant's predictor was determined to be statistically significant (Pr < 0.039) in the bullet model but not statistically significant for the target model. This predictor is, therefore, also included in the bullet model. The estimate for this predictor in the bullet model is 1.95, which suggests an increased propensity for fault exists with an increasing number of occupants.

Driver's license class summary statistics indicate an overwhelming majority of fully (G) licensed driver's involvement in the selected collisions. Crude odds (CO) for target and bullet drivers amongst the various license classes (GI, G2, any GM combination and full G licensed drivers) are shown in Figure 5.3. The CO for G licensed drivers is significantly greater than any of the other classes. This may be attributed as a direct result of exposure, in addition to the sheer number of G licensed drivers as compared to all other classes.

The gender of the front seated passenger was also included in the study. Examining the CO in Figure 5.4 individually for male vs. female show a three to four-fold increase across both target and bullet vehicles. For female vs. male passenger presence in target vs. bullet vehicles, a COR of 1.31 was determined. This finding suggests female presence has an increased incidence of collision. Perhaps the predominantly male driving population is more easily distracted by font seat passengers who are members of the opposite sex. However, when this predictor was included in the regression model along with other "human" variables, it was determined to be not statistically significant.

For the target vehicle model, this predictor was determined to be not statistically significant (Pr < 0.379) as was eliminated from the model. This compliments the findings

Apparent driver actions were also examined. From the values in Table 5.2, it is all to easy to draw immediate conclusions without diligence. For instance, the OR value of 1.02 indicates no appreciable difference between exceeding the speed limit and the base condition of driving normally. However, due to the extremely low frequencies (6 and 11 for target and bullet, respectively) the values of this class explain too little and are of little meaning in the scope of things. Another class within this predictor, titled "Speeding to fast for

condition" suffers from this same issue. In fact, a handful of other classes available in the data were removed altogether from Table 5.2 due to extremely low and zero frequencies. Also, several of the levels within this predictor were deemed to be too highly associated with the outcome variable. For instance, "Disobeying a Traffic Control" is directly associated with being at fault. These variables are shown in Table 5.2 with a strikethrough across them. When these

classes were included in· the regression model for "human" factors, both target and bullet models eliminated this class as Pr == 0.998 and were even deemed "non-estimatible" by SAS through a lack of convergence.

Improper turns as compared with driving properly for target vs bullet yielded a COR==5.26 through summary statistics, with odds from the summary statistics of 0.27 and 0.08. From the summary statistics, this class seems problematic for target vehicles. From manually screening and entering each collision, officer's field notes repeatedly expressed a similar sentiment. This notion is further evidenced by the higher propensity for target drivers to be at fault, as apparent in Table 5.1. The regression modeling target and bullet "human" model odds == 43.41 and 18.16 with Pr == 0.001 and Pr == 0.001, respectively. From these fault regression model values, both target and bullet. suffer from high odds. Furthermore, through taking the OR of these two odds, it can be shown that targets suffer from this fault class comparison more than double (43.4: 18.2 == 2.4) the odds that bullets do.

When another class within driver actions was considered, namely disobeying traffic control, the opposite result was shown. This class as compared with driving normally for target vs. bullet yield a COR==0.61. Thus, a lower

propensity for target driver's to disobey traffic controls exist in the data. It is easy to conceptualize that, for a large part, disobeying traffic controls is common in the bullet vehicle. For instance, imagine a classic side impact

(

Since the above OR indicates that there is a lesser propensity for these to occur on target drivers a greater propensity exists for these to occur on bullet drivers. The regression results for this class of the predictor compared with the base class of "Driving Properly" are highly statistically significant as P = 0.024 and P = 0.001 and for target and bullet respectively. The corresponding odds values determined from the regression modeling are 6.49 and 11.84 respectively. The OR from these (6.5: 11.8 = 0.54) also indicates a lower propensity for targets to be at fault under these conditions. Most likely this is attributed to the intimate

relationship that may exist with fault and driver actions that are "improper", "disobeying", "failed" etc. The connotations of some of the classes within this predictor potentially serve as partial indicators of fault outcome, which may overwhelmingly serve as a powerful individual class factor. However, this

could also be attributed to other confounding factors which may cloud the values of the salient factors. In addition, this may very well be a rare case statistical significance achieved by chance alone. Regardless, it is a class within this predictor that is debatable.

When the "Failure to yield right of way" class was examined against driving normally for target vs. bullet a COR=8.24 was determined. There appears to be a concern with target drivers failing to yield right of way which creates an inclination to be caught in the path of other (bullet) vehicles. From this target drivers seem to frequently be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Combining

this- finding with the bullet driver's tendency indicated -above to apparently disobey traffic controls spells a recipe for disaster. From the regression results, an OR

=6.94 was determined for target vs. bullet for "failure to yield right of

way" vs. "driving normally". This indicates a lower propensity for target vs. bullet in this contrast,. Similarly to the previous two class levels within this predictor, it is believed that this class serves strongly as an indicator of fault, which may overwhelm the fault outcome used in the regression. As a result, this contrast is also considered debatable.

The final predictor considered in the "human" regression modeling was Driver Condition. From the summary statistics of Table 5.2, essentially all of the collisions (87.7% and 91.0% for target and bullet, respectively) fell within the "Normal" base class. Only a handful of more iqattentive target drivers as

compared with bullet drivers were found, and this resulted in a OR = 1.48. When this predictor was considered in the logistic regression modeling for both target and bullet, it did not meet the statistical criteria where Pr < 0.05 and was therefore backwards stepwise eliminated.

When vehicle colour was included in the extra-human regression modeling for both target and bullet models, it failed to allow the model to converge under SAS's stringent type 3 analyses, and was therefore eliminated from the models .
As expected, measures of goodness of fit increased after this variable was

Perhaps this can be attributed to over-

parameterization issues associated with the (rather large number of) nine separate classes. Having many descriptors and a limited number of

Frequencies and COR for Road Alignment shown in Table 5.4 indicate that the straight-on-Ievel has been set as base class and exists for over 88% of the selected collisions. COR =1.14 for the straight-on-hill class contrasted with the base class suggests that only a slightly higher propensity for target vs. bullet fault vehicles exists. Other classes for this predictor are obscenely too

infrequent and the analysis of these variables would likely cause more harm than good. As discussed in the limitations section, Simpson's Paradox and other issues associated with rare occurrences tends to discredit any results when using OR as a measurement -tool. This is simply one of the limitations within the realm of Odds and OR. A significantly larger database may help overcome this issue.

Road alignment was included as a predictor in the extra-human target and bullet models. Like the majority of other predictors in this report, it too was

determined to be not statistically significant and was backwards stepwise eliminated in the 5th and 9th iterations for target and bullet models, respectively.

Vehicle Maneuver fell almost entirely into two classes, namely Going ahead and Turning left. This is a direct result of the selection criteria for these

collisions, where left-turning side impact collisions were sought (as discussed in

- 121 -

Chapter Analysis 1: MVA Reported Collisions). The -sum of the .left turning percentage distributions of 78.9% and 19.5% for target and bullet (totaling 98.4%, slightly less than 100% due to missing and incomplete observations,) confirm this. From Table 5.3, target vs. bullet vehicles turning left are

compared with the base condition of going ahead. A calculated COR = 15.97 indicates a high propensity for this condition to exist. This is likely attributed to the consequences associated and conflicts arising from making left turns through: crossing the paths of other oncoming vehicles; judging available gaps; watching out for pedestrians; and monitoring signal phase. However, under the regression modeling for target and bullet, this predictor was determined to be not statistically significant by the 6 th and
7th

iterations, respectively, and was

therefore eliminated from any further modeling.

From Table 5.4, Road Surface Condition is predominantly dry, followed by wet. More importantly, there is no appreciable difference in the distributions within the various classes. Th!s seems logical, since the conditions on the target road are likely to be identical to the conditions on the bullet road, with exceptions on one side or the other due to rare circumstances such as improper drainage, debris, spills, partial salting/plowing, etc. When this predictor was included in the target and bullet regression modeling, it was determined to be not statistically significant at the therefore eliminated.

Other remaining predictors including road condition, road pavement markings and vehicle condition all followed similar conditions, where extremely few observations were noted outside of the basic and normal condition. These predictors were also eliminated in the regression process due to poor statistical significance and a lack of convergence of the models.

Rather unique to these other variables, RMAX and VMAX representing maximum posted speed and maximum pre-collision vehicle speed, respectively, are treated as continuous and included in the regression analysis for target and bullet models. Because of the nature of

continuous variables, it is not possible to construct or compare contrasts and OR for these two predictors. However, through regression it was determined for the bullet model that RMAX was highly statistically significant, P =0.003, with an estimate of 0.05. The positive polarity of this value indicates a marginally increasing propensity for target vehicle to be at fault with higher posted maximum speeds. Perhaps this positive association is a result of the lesser

amount of time associated with smaller gaps that creates fault causing conditions. For the corresponding bullet model, this predictor failed to meet

statistical significance criteria and was eliminated. The regression modeling yielded both target and bullet models Maximum Pre-Collision Vehicle Speed to be highly statistically significant, as P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0001 with estimates of, respectively. The negative association of these estimates suggests that both target and bullet are inversely fault associated with higher pre-collision speeds. While this may seem counter-intuitive, it may be a direct result of the nature and circumstance in which this data field is recorded. The pre-collision vehicle speed is typically determined through simply questioning the involved persons, and involved parties may intentionally understate their actual traveled speed in fearing consequences of admitting high speeds to investigating officers. If this is widespread enough, a bias may exist within this predictor.

Table 5.5 lists remaining variables available which 'were excluded from any modeling in this analysis. These were excluded from modeling through a

combination of logical grounds and a lack of past research showing any fault outcome associations. .

Odds derived from the exponentiated estimates of the regression model results for intersections with vs. without collisions yielded the following statistically significant results:

..

·

An odds of 0.32 shows a lower propensity exists for No vs. Yes for the presence of appearance of FAG Intersection Systems at intersections with collisions.

·

3 legged vs. 4 legged intersections had an odds of 0.41, which shows a lower propensity for selected collisions to occur at 3 vs. 4 legged intersections exists.

·

Q_major statistically shows no effect with increasing or decreasing odds. This suggests that the data sampled shows no statistical difference for intersections experiencing collisions vs. those without based on volume on the major roadway.

Through additional examination of this intersection data, outside of the regression modeling, a manual approach to explore the FAG factor was conducted. Manually calculated, separated and plotted odds show (Figure 5.17) differences in FAG and FAG-free intersections. An apparent trend occurs near the middle of the graph, which is likely attributed to a high proportion of vehicles on both roadways (especially those with crossing paths) resulting in a high number of potential conflicts. More importantly, it can be seen that the FAG curve lies above the without FAG curve throughout the graph, which indicates a higher odds of a given intersection having a collision. However, it should be noted thtlt minor roadway volumes

are not statistically significant when considered in the regression with all other predictors, but that is an analysis which exists in isolation of this.

5.7 Summary of Results for Intersection Collision Factors
For intersections, system type (scoot or mtss), presence of FAG, the number of legs, the major trafficway flow, and the road classifications of the North, South and West legs were found to be statistically significant factors.

Even with the parameter contrasts described above, it is possible to gain a general understanding but difficult extract an exact meaning behind several of the results. Statistically, it has been determined that these findings do exist. Pessimistically speaking, reasons for their existence could be attributed to

- chance since no current literature supporting this exists. Optimistically, one could speculate that this is a valid new discovery, perhaps even a function of Toronto's road structure, where there are significantly different attributes of city intersections by their approaches - attributes which have bearing on collision propensity at intersections. Specific examples of this could be the commuter nature of the city, where more people enter than leave during work-trips in the morning/afternoon hours, or perhaps even commuters traveling with sunlight in their eyes both ways, from their dwellings in the east end, etc. both of which may "clash" when crossing paths at intersections. Certainly, other such confounding factors have the potential to cloud salient factors from emerging. Regardless, inferences have been made from the data and never have any beliefs been imposed - the like of which would sabotage a fair analysis. Rather,

including variables that were believed to be of relevance quantifies a belief.

5.8 Limitations
Although it is difficult. to quantify, it is the opinion of this author that the greatest limitation of this report results from the inability to capture and include all relevant factors for analysis. As discussed throughout the report, other

confounding factors likely exist. Literature reviewed and discussed pointedly shows this. It is better to do less exhaustively than to do more haphazardly.

The second most significant limitation is underestimation, which stems from numerous sources. According to the data available for the year 1998, there are
- 136-

notably on a sliver of reported collisions that occur in "Metro Toronto", and a massive disproportion of locations listed as "Other", as compared to later years where many more collisions are listed within "Metro Toronto". This is like attributed to the City of Toronto's amalgamation on January IS., 1998, when many collision reporters (police officers) were in a sort of transition phase where they were partial to label Metro Toronto's "new" territory correctly.

Also, it is likely that the number of collisions going unreported increased first in 1997 with the introduction of self-reporting, and again in 1998 (in combination with the mentioned effect in paragraph above), when the property damage minimum for reporting increased to $1000. It is also likely that the numbers of collisions involving minimal injuries are underreported since injuries such as whiplash or soft tissue injuries are not apparent at the scene of the collision. The reverse holds true, albeit weaker, when retribution for losses is required.

As mentioned earlier in the report, injury severity and death is updated 30 days after the collision and any change of status of injury severity (and possible death) will be left out of the data. This can lead to underestimation, which may not be captured on the file. This also occurs when injury victims seek medical attention after the collision is reported. Perhaps electronically linked medical
and collision records could overcome this.

Another -source of underestimation exists in reported "Driver Condition", which is indicated as a separate field within the Ontario Motor vehicle Accident Report's Field (see Appendix B for complete list of fields). Since investigating officers must make judgment calls on driver's ability and condition as related to alcohol, drugs, medical condition, fatigue etc, and these judgments are subject to error. Also, since investigating officers arrive after the collision, driver

conditions may change with time - provided that the driver is still even in attendance of the scene. Often times, injured drivers have left to seek medical treatment.

However, there are issues with the data used in this study. Similar to other studies is the issue of completeness of police reports on motor vehicle collisions. There may be considerate under reporting of minimal and minor injury classified collisions. Another concern is the reliability of injury coding, as misclassification between levels is possible. Although police should followup through hospital, r~cords for 30 days in order to identify fatal-injuries, patients who die following this period rpay not be rep0r:ted appropriately [9]. Furthermore, it is expected that there is an underreporting of alcohol involvement, but this paper shall not focus on approximating this objectively.

It is generally accepted that many motorists wish to avoid insurance coverage increases associated with reporting collisions and fault assessments. Examining the Fault Determination Rules reveals that if no degree of fault is assessed

- 138-

against ,a driver, his renewal premium should not be affected · .However, if a degree of fault is assessed against the driver, it is likely that there will be some effect on the renewal premium [40].

This concept is increasingly likely to be true with decreasing severity of collisions.

Furthermore, "[i]f an insured feels that fault has been improperly assessed and cannot resolve the matter with the insurance company, his or her remedy would be to commence an action in court and have the degree of fault established by the court [40]. The hassle and intimidation of going to court may further

disway driver's from reporting collisions.

As indicated in a study by Applied Research and Evaluation Services, another significant problem with these data is that for the most part, police in Canada are not trained in recognizing driver intoxication by either alcohol or drugs (especially considering the effects of alcohol impairment can resemble those caused by a head trauma), so their estimations probably under-represent actual frequencies of impaired driving in the crashes that they attend and report upon [37]. This report also argues that the extent of drug-impaired crashes is

underestimated due to a variety of reasons, primarily due to a lack of testing and testing sensitivity. They point to the results of a classic study by in 1982 by

- 139-

Terhune that -found- that -driver- BACs had to reach 0.20 or over before 58% of the police recognized impairment level [38].

However, even the collisions which are investigated are subject to many other types of limitations. For instance, not all police officers are vehicle collision experts. As a result, data obtained from their reports may be erroneous.

Furthermore, their reports must be manually entered from handwritten forms to electronic spreadsheets. This process is currently still the responsibility of

Police, and since it is a manual human process, it introduces potential errors. Contributing to this error source is the fact that Toronto's current Police chief is renowned for "getting officers out from behind desks, and back onto the streets" - Unknown source.

Currently in Toronto, linking self reporting collisions from one to another is becoming a daunting task. CRCs are often abused as driver's claim collisions occurred at differing
in~ersections

and under different conditions that the truth.

Furthermore, drivers are trying to test the system by reporting to different CRCs throughout the city with differing false statements. Perhaps the greatest

weakness of this process can be attributed to drivers reporting at separate CRC's with falsified intersection names and explanations. This makes it increasingly difficult to link collisions to a specific intersection. Fortunately, the system discussed earlier in this report developed by Allianz, predicts that widespread use of their electronic self-reporting system will speed up and simplify the

process of matching reports from the various parties involved collision.

the same

As mentioned in a summary by the Chronic Disease and Injuries - Injury Prevention and Substance Abuse Prevention [20], there are limitations associated with the Ontario collision data location fields. In particular, collision data is limited to location of collision entered geographically by place of occurrence. Their report expresse's hope for future work on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation to include additional information by residence of driver in future publications since analysis based on place of occurrence can be misleading. Collisions may occur to people who do not live in that area, particularly in areas frequented by tourists and commuters. This has particular importance when considering underreporting.

.

In addition, there are issues with stepwise variable selection process used in the analysis's that should be stated. Here are some of the problems with stepwise variable selection.

1. R-squared values are biased high, yielding confidence intervals for effects and predicted values that are falsely narrow (See Altman and Anderson, Statistics ill
Medicine).

- 141 -

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

2. It yields P-values that do not have the proper meaning and the proper correction for them is apparently a very complex issue. 3. It has problems in the presence of collinearity. 4. Increasing the sample size doesn't help very much (see Derksen and Keselman). 5. It allows us to not think about the problem. 6. It uses a lot of paper.

[39]

In addition to analysis limitations, this report is affected by issues associated with exposure. As with the quasi-induced exposure techniques used commonly in similar studies, one must remember that OR used iq this report are a measure rather different than one that can account for driver miles, licensed drivers, and a host of other exposures.

Furthermore, the interpretation of odds and OR are surrounded by limitations, . , perhaps most profoundly by that of Simpson's Paradox. The fact that a

marginal table may exhibit an association completely different from the partial tables is known as Simpson's Paradox (Simpson 1951, Yule 1903) [28].

Missing values have significant implications when dealing with OR's as they can affect the denominator of the ratio and yield exaggerated results. These become even more apparent when over-parameterization issues arise, as many

- 142-

predictors in the variables used contain several classes. The large number of parameters and relatively limited quantity of data available create overparameterization issues

The fault assessment used to create flags indicating target and bullet driver faults was not a simple task. Ontario's Statutes and Regulations as written in the Insurance Act [40] provide comprehensive Fault Determination Rules, which were used in this study. One
we~kness

inherent in using the fault determination

rules stems from the its use of percentage attributions of fault in specific scenarios. These percentage attributions, particularly partial fault assessments (i.e., of 25% and 75% at fault) do not directly translate to a binary fault outcome. Under the given conditions, this was decided to be the best method . · Note that when no clear indication of either being at fault or not at fault existed, the fault observation was left blank. It is also possible for both vehicles to simultaneously be either at fault or not-at-fault. In light of this, support in

following the fault determination rules is achieved through its provision of a consistent means of assessment, and is recommended for future use.

As in any report, it is essential that these limitations be recognized throughout all of the presented results. Further to this is the potential multiplicative

negative effect of all these mentioned limitations, some of which may act in conjunction with others to cloud the salient factors from emerging.

6 Conclusions and Recommendations

6.1 General
At a minimal cost, a preliminary analysis the identification of factors involved in side impact left turning collisions was performed. Crude odds ratios in

addition to regression model computed and exponentiated estimates for odds ratios were examined. Differences between these were primarily attributed to the fact that other confounding variables exist and lie outside the scope of this research. Limitations aside, statistically significant values for factors associated with these collisions were discussed and certain factors showed clear associations with the fault outcome.

It is not surprising to see different factors appearing in separate models. It seems possible that bullet vehicles are sensitive to maximum posted speeds. After all, it is almost expected that the characteristics that define target and bullet vehicles be different~ particularly because they are two unique and independent items.

Missing values for each variable was rather problematic throughout the data used, especially in comparison to the large sample sizes in other studies discussed in the literature review.

6.2 Conclusions
The factors that were statistically significant and included in the bullet models differed slightly from the factors found in the target models. Both target and bullet human factor models shared Apparent Driver Action and Front Seated Passenger Age as significant factors. However, only the bullet model included Driver Age and only the target model included Number of Vehicle Occupants. Similarly, for the extra-human factors, both Road Character and Approximate Vehicle Speed appeared in target and bullet models. However. the bullet model contained Maximum Posted Speed while the target model contained Number of Lanes.

From the intersection analysis, intersections were studied to determine causes and factors associated with intersections experiencing collisions and those without with classifications of left-turning and angle. over a period of three years. Certain features and combinations of features showed statistically

·

significant propensities to be associated with intersections with collisions as compared to those without. These factors were intersection system (SCOOT or MTSS), presence of FAG. Number of Legs. Flow on the major roadway, and classifications of North, South and West roads. While these predictors as a whole were statistically significant, only selected contrasts within yielded statistically significant odds.

- 145 -

Crude odds (CO) and crude odds ratios (COR) were used to exhibit findings from summary statistics for the combination of both target and bullet vehicles. Odds and odds ratios (OR) were used throughout the report as measures between predictors and predictor contrasts for statistically significant results (P

< 0.05) of target vs. bullet comparisons. The organization of the data through
classifications and sub-classifications (i.e., Human and Extra-Human) make distinctions between variables for separate models more apparent. This creates ease in model building. The logistic modeling with the commonly accepted P < 0.05 criteria as shown for other reports reviewed is easy to interpret.

i

Furthennore, it was intended to compare the known case target and bullet vehicle driver's characteristics. Ideally, one could expect to find statistically proven differences between target and bullet drivers involved in collisions, particularly matched with fault outcomes. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, this infonnation on comparison vehicles drivers was never made available. Perhaps with continued persistent efforts, policy makers and in

particular, Metropolitan Police decision makers will provide better access to confidential data for legitimate studies such as this.

Salient factors associated with selected side impact collisions and intersection collisions in general have been reported. These provide insight into the analysis of data that shall be applied in further research in a more focused analysis of the in-depth collision database that has been developed.

6.3 Recommendations
Throughout the composition of this report, a number of recommendations became apparent. These have been separated into two categories, namely,

recommendations for data, and future work.

I
(
Recommendations with respect to Data: · Investigating officers should have a provision on the MV A reports to record info on the object struck, specifically what happened to it (i.e., breakaway pole, did it indeed breakaway? Did it fall over, deform, displace the roadside barrier, etc.) .
·

·

Include

other

environmental

weather

conditions,

linked

electronically, such as temperature, humidity, etc.

·

The MV A report author's should create a field within Vehicle Type . for "Sport Utility Vehicle", and "Mini-Van" and "Full sized Passenger Van", as opposed to the existing "Passenger Van" field which is too limited.

- 147-

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

·

MVA reports have a limited vehicle occupant "position" (or seating) fields that do not account for the rear rows of minivans seats. This field should be modernized to account for this.

·

MV A reports should be perfectly linked with Self-reporting fonns, using a similar numeric style and sequence for codes depicting collision details. This would increase the ease with which these

documents could be merged.- Transport Canada should also consider adopting a similar fonnat, in addition to the extra observations they make. This would allow further compatibility and ease for linked data set efforts.

Recommendations with respect to future work:

·

Following the fault determination rules helped to provide some degree of consistency and is recommended for future use. Perhaps a fault field directly on an MV A would be of some added benefit.

·

MV A reports should have a field indicating more than just two different types of LT collisions. There are many more combinations of LT collision, and addressing this concern would certainly enrich the data.

- 148,

:~

·

MV A reports should indicate whether the second generation air bags deployed, or at least indicate which phase and type of deployment occurred. Insurance agencies would have a particular interest in this for many reasons.

·

Through manual data entry, it was repeatedly observed that investigating police officer's labeled roadways for vehicle one and two as RI and R2. Unfortunately, they did this at their discretion without any apparent nor consistent procedure.

·

Police recorded roadway designations often were not respective of vehicles one and two, V 1 and V2. This creates confusion in

differentiating V 1 and V2 between the R2 label, "reference point" which differs from the Rl label "trafficway". Officers may tend to simply label RI the more major of the two streets. This has negative consequences when entering and organizing data for analysis and comparison of target and bullet vehicles.

- 149-

Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission.

·

A good next step would be to take the intersection analysis to another level and focus on identifying side impact collisions. From this, comparisons between intersections with collisions and with side impact collisions could be made. Comparisons with intersections experience varying levels of collision could also be made.

·

Combinations of contrasts built on existing contrasts would be an interesting way to analyze areas of known concern further. With additional data, it would be interesting to exploring combinations of , . features such as FDW and FAG, which wouldn't be possible in the current data due to its size limitations.

·

In future work, it may be better suited to model fault outcomes as continuous percentages, rather than binary dichotomous outcomes. This is particularly true since the Ontario Fault Determination Rules [29] produce fault in terms of percentages, and riot simply as binary outcomes.

Appendix F: Data Entry Guide
City of Toronto Collision Data Entry Instructions · Target vehicles are V I traveling on R I. _!!!!l!~t vehicles are V2 on R2. Data entry must be accommodated for this. Many fields are dependant on this being coded in proper sequence to this. When it is determined that police have indicated target and bullet as vehicle 2, I, as opposed to I, 2. then many fields are reversed (w.r.t.the "&" sign), including: ·

MVA9& 10 · MVA I 1& 12 · MVA 13 & 14 · MVA IS & 16 · MVA 17& 18 · MVA 19&20 · MVA21 &22 · MVA23&24 · MVA33 &34 · MVA 35 &36 · MVA43 &44 · MVA 46&47 · MVA 48, 49, 50, 5 1,52,53 & 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 · MVA 60 & 61 · MV A 62,63 & 64,65 This may require reversal of involved persons (drivers and passengers) gender, age, injuries, position, etc. · · · · Unless otherwise stated, yes = I, no = 2. When unknown, observation is left as blank. The failed to remain' checkbox is located m;ar the top of the collision report and is simply a yes = I or no = 2 or unl\nown = blank field. The intersection perpendicular field is determined from the sketch(es) provided in the collision report(s). It is a yes or no field. The number of lanes in R I and R2 is usually recorded by police in boxes nearest the sketch. On a two-way roadway with 3 lanes in each way, that would be 6 lanes recorded. The color of lights field is indicative of any note that points to any of the following collision characteristics: I - Involvement of Amber/Red 2 - End of LT priority phase 3 - Totally red light running, no amber 4 - Green - 206-

Otherwise, it is assumed to be either other or unknown and is left blank. This information is often indicated in the sketch notes or diagram itself. · Position of passengers is to be in accordance with the manner specified on the coded template page. Do not follow the police recorded style for this field. Only use the middle seating row seats (3 and 4) when a middle row exists. Otherwise, use the last row. I.e., in the case of a 4 door sedan, use the front most seats (D, 2, I) and the rearmost seats (5,6,7) and never the middle row seats (3 and 4). Using this manner of coding passengers, there will be many blank passenger fields where no passenger exists.
