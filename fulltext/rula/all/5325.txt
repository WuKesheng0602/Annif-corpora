ARGUING  WITH  GOD   ABSTRACT      Recently  published  pro-atheist  books  by  Richard  Dawkins,  Sam  Harris,  and   Christopher  Hitchens  have  reignited  the  age-old  debate  about  the  existence  of  God.   Many  pro-faith  books  have  been  written  in  response.  The  deliberations  between   theists  and  atheists  have  moved  beyond  the  written  word  and  onto  the  public   debate  platform.  The  present  paper  observes  three  such  `God  debates'  through  the   theoretical  lens  of  rhetoric.  Using  a  modified  grounded  theory  approach,  and   borrowing  from  literature  concerning  public  debates  and  religious  rhetoric,  a   number  of  rhetorical  strategies  are  identified.  Thomas  Kuhn's  incommensurability   theory  (1962)  is  then  applied  to  the  results  in  an  effort  to  locate  evidence  of   compatibility  and  incompatibility  between  the  speakers  championing  the  opposing   paradigms.  Findings  suggest  that  the  speakers  are  able  to  achieve  meaningful   communication  when  appealing  to  a  shared  means  of  persuasion  (secular,  scientific   language)  and  recognizing  the  diversity  in  their  opponents'  position.  Conversely,  the   speakers  are  unable  to  achieve  meaningful  communication  when  engaging  in  one- side  attack-based  rhetoric  and  disagreeing  on  the  constitution  of  evidence.  Such   findings  are  useful  for  communications  professionals  tasked  with  supporting   meaningful  communication  between  divergent  perspectives.                                      iv

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   VOICES      Scene:  Taken  from  Does  God  Exist,  a  debate  between  Rabbi  David  Wolpe  and   bestselling  author  and  neuroscientist  Sam  Harris,  hosted  at  the  American  Jewish   University  in  2007.      David  Wolpe:  Science,  and  the  place  of  science  ­  which  is  at  the  heart  of,  in   particular,  Dawkins'  and  Dennett's  book  ­  is  part  of  what  people  debate  about  and  I   think  don't  understand  very  well.      Moderator  (directed  to  David  Wople):  What  do  you  think  they  don't  get?      David  Wolpe:  They  don't  get  that  science  is  powerful,  but  it's  narrow.  And  the  idea   that  science  explains  human  life  is  an  idea  that  I  think  is  promoted  only  by  people   who  are  under  the  misimpression  that  the  place  of  science  in  human  life  is  a   scientific  question,  when  in  fact  it's  a  philosophical  or  religious  question.  And  you   can't  explain  the  place  of  science  in  human  life  in  scientific  terms,  just  like  you  can't   explain  what  an  idea  is  in  scientific  terms  ­  it's  intangible  and  philosophical  and   religious,  and  I  think  that  a  lot  of  people  are,  or  at  least  a  number  of  people  who  are   educated  scientifically,  but  not  philosophically  or  religiously,  think  that  now  that   science  is  as  powerful  and  as  potent  as  it  is  there  is  no  place  for  religion  or  it  has  in   some  sense  disproved  religion  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).               1  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   Moderator  (directed  to  Sam  Harris):  What  do  you  think  of  that  statement?        Sam  Harris:  That's  a  very  good  place  to  start.  I  think  that  one  thing  to  notice  is  that   the  dialogue  between  science  and  religion  has  gone  this  way:  it  has  been  one  of   relentless  and  one-directional  erosion  of  religious  authority.  I  would  challenge   anyone  here  to  think  of  a  question  upon  which  we  once  had  a  scientific  answer  ­ however  inadequate  ­  but  which  now  the  best  answer  is  a  religious  one.  Now  you   can  think  of  a  multiple  number  of  questions  that  run  the  other  way,  where  we  once   had  a  religious  answer,  and  now  the  authority  of  religion  has  been  battered  and   nullified  by  science  and  by  moral  progress  and  secular  progress  generally,  and  I   think  that's  not  an  accident  (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).                                                2  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   INTRODUCTION   "Communication  across  the  revolutionary  divide  is  inevitably  partial."     (Kuhn,  1996,  p.  149)      The  excerpt  in  the  above  section,  Voices,  was  taken  from  one  of  a  growing  number  of   public  debates  that  are  circulating  online  concerning  the  existence  of  god.  This   particular  excerpt  implies  the  range  of  issues  involved  in  the  debates,  the  divergent   understandings  of  how  positions  can  be  substantiated,  and  the  contrasting   paradigms  involved.  The  question  of  god,  which  has  long  divided  camps  the  world   over,  has  been  experiencing  a  cultural  renaissance  in  the  western  world  throughout   the  past  decade,  resulting  largely  from  a  series  of  bestselling  books  championing  the   atheist  position.  The  most  popular  of  these  books,  The  End  Of  Faith:  Religion,  Terror,   and  the  Future  of  Reason  (Harris,  2004),  The  God  Delusion  (Dawkins,  2006),  and  god   is  not  Great:  How  Religion  Poisons  Everything  (Hitchens,  2007),  openly  challenge   religious  belief  and  practice  while  relying  on  scientific  logic  as  evidence  for  the  non- divine  origins  of  the  universe.  These  three  books  alone  have  spent  over  90  weeks  on   the  New  York  Times  Bestsellers  List,  have  been  translated  into  59  languages,  and   have  sold  over  10  million  copies.  There  are  also  many  other  recently  published   books  that  have  championed  the  atheist  position  (Barker,  2008;  Blackford  &   Schüklenk,  2009;  Dennett,  2007;  Mills,  2006;  Ray,  2010;  Stenger,  2008,  2009).  Not   surprisingly,  this  full  frontal  attack  on  religion  was  met  with  a  great  deal  of   opposition,  as  dozens  of  full-length  books  have  been  published  in  response   (Berlinski,  2008;  Collins,  2006,  2010;  Craig,  2008,  2010;  D'Souza,  2007,  2009,  2012;            3

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   viewpoints  is  the  driving  force  behind  the  present  study,  guiding  the  research   questions,  data  collection,  data  analysis,  and  discussion.                                                                           5  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   RESEARCH  QUESTIONS      Public  deliberation  as  a  communication  platform  encompasses  many  facets,  each   worthy  of  study  and  attention.  Often  scrutinized  are  the  oratorical  skills  of  speakers,   or  the  ability  of  speakers  to  persuade  audiences  with  effective  delivery  styles  or   charismatic  demeanors  (Tietge,  2008).  Also  worthy  of  study  are  the  shifting   dynamics  of  speaker-audience  relationships  in  the  age  of  vast,  online  audiences.   Indeed,  debates  are  increasingly  less  restricted  by  geographical  limitations,  and   their  online  accessibility  allows  for  immediate,  ongoing,  and  widespread  discussion   (Howard,  2010;  Ruiz,  2011).  Though  both  of  these  factors  play  important  roles  in   public  debate,  a  meaningful  engagement  with  them  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the   present  research  paper.        Keeping  in  mind  the  broader  context  of  the  kinds  of  issues  worth  examining  in   public  debates,  I  will  focus  my  attention  on  what  is  actually  being  said  by  the   debaters,  the  moderator  and  the  audience.  That  is,  I  will  analyze  the  substance  of  the   arguments  themselves  through  a  rhetorical  analysis  of  the  debate  transcripts.  My   study  will  incorporate  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  elements.  Specifically,  the   following  two  research  questions  will  guide  my  analysis:  (1)  What  kinds  of  rhetorical   strategies  are  used  in  the  recent  wave  of  god  debates?  (2)  What  does  the  frequency  of   usage  of  the  rhetorical  strategies  tell  us  about  the  ability  of  the  opposing  parties  to   engage  in  meaningful  communication?               6  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   LITERATURE  REVIEW      The  most  significant  association  between  the  study  of  god  debates  and  the  world  of   professional  communication  literature  is  that  of  rhetoric.  Rhetoric  provides  the   framework  with  which  we  can  identify  and  understand  the  persuasive  strategies   used  in  the  god  debates.  Though  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper  to  assess  the   validity  or  strength  of  the  arguments  put  forth,  I  will  observe  how  rhetorical   strategies  are  used  to  persuade  audiences,  and  what  these  different  strategies  tell  us   about  the  potential  for  meaningful  communication  between  opposing  paradigms.  As   such,  a  rhetorical  analysis  will  be  conducted  in  order  to  determine  the  strategies   employed  and  to  identify  evidence  of  in/commensurability  in  the  recent  wave  of  god   debates.        The  present  research  paper  is  supported  by  three  groups  of  literature.  The  first   group  provides  a  brief  introduction  to  the  rhetorical  tradition,  as  articulated  by   Aristotle,  focusing  on  its  conceptual  links  to  the  debate  medium  and  audience   persuasion.  The  second  group  provides  an  overview  of  studies  that  have  used  a   rhetorical  framework  to  examine  public  debates,  particularly  those  pertaining  to   religious  discourse.  The  third  group  offers  a  look  at  Thomas  Kuhn's   incommensurability  theory  (Kuhn,  1996),  a  body  of  work  that  examines  reasons   behind  the  incompatibility  of  opposing  paradigms.  These  three  groups  of  literature   help  to  develop  a  comprehensive  theoretical  frame  ­  from  historical  and  broad  to   contemporary  and  specific  ­  of  the  debates  in  question.              7  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   Group  1:   At  its  broadest  point,  the  present  research  paper  falls  within  the  theoretical   tradition  of  rhetoric.  Rhetoric,  as  a  tool  for  understanding  debate,  dates  back  to   Aristotle's  seminal  work,  Rhetoric,  written  in  350  B.C.E.  In  Rhetoric,  Aristotle  posits   that  "all  men  attempt  to  discuss  statements  and  to  maintain  them,  to  defend   themselves  and  to  attack  others,"  and  that  "[t]he  arousing  of  prejudice,  pity,  anger,   and  similar  emotions  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  essential  facts,  but  is  merely  a   personal  appeal  to  the  man  who  is  judging  the  case"  (p.  1).  In  other  words,  Aristotle   explains  rhetoric  as  an  art  of  persuasion;  a  debate  tactic  grounded  not  in  factual   validity  or  logical  consistency,  but  rather  in  the  strategic  attacking  of  opponents,  the   compelling  defense  of  oneself,  and  the  persuasive  appeal  to  what  audiences  already   partially  know,  feel,  believe  or  fear  (Aristotle,  Rhetoric).        At  the  heart  of  Aristotle's  understanding  of  rhetoric  is  the  notion  of  the  enthymeme.   While  rhetoric  concerns  the  various  modes  of  persuasion  used  in  creating   arguments,  enthymemes  deal  with  how  speakers  demonstrate  arguments  (Craig  &   Muller,  2007).  Based  on  the  syllogistic  logic  that  certain  premises  lead  to  certain   conclusions,  an  orator  who  is  skilled  in  producing  syllogisms  will  also  be  best   equipped  to  produce  persuasive  enthymemes  (Craig  &  Muller,  2007):  All  mammals   are  mortal  (major  premise),  all  humans  are  mammals  (minor  premise),  therefore  all   humans  will  die  (conclusion).  Unlike  logically  coherent  syllogisms,  however,   enthymemes  consist  of  unstated  assumptions  that  must  hold  true  for  the  premises   to  lead  to  the  conclusion:  All  mammals  are  mortal  (major  premise),  therefore  all            8  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   humans  will  die  (conclusion).  In  other  words,  a  logically  incomplete  argument  ­  if   constructed  strategically  and  delivered  convincingly  ­  can  be  as,  or  more,  effective   than  a  logically  complete  argument.  As  such,  enthymemes  play  an  important  role  in   rhetorical  persuasion  and  constitute  a  powerful  appeal  to  an  audience's  sense  of   logical  coherence:  "The  true  and  the  approximately  true  are  apprehended  by  the   same  faculty"  (Craig  &  Muller,  122).  Enthymemes  act  as  a  powerful  observational   lens  for  the  analysis  of  the  arguments  used  in  the  god  debates  and  are  particularly   useful  for  identifying  `Emotional'  rhetoric.      Kenneth  Burke,  in  A  Rhetoric  of  Motives  (1969),  moves  beyond  the  traditional   persuasion-based  conception  of  rhetoric  to  incorporate  a  discussion  of   identification:     [P]ersuasion  ranges  from  the  bluntest  quest  of  advantage,  as  in  sales   promotion  or  propaganda,  through  courtship,  social  etiquette,  education,  and   the  sermon,  to  a  `pure'  form  that  delights  in  the  process  of  appeal  for  itself   alone,  without  ulterior  purpose.  And  identification  ranges  from  the  politician   who,  addressing  an  audience  of  farmers,  says,  `I  was  a  farm  boy  myself,'   through  the  mysteries  of  social  status,  to  the  mystic's  devout  identification   with  the  source  of  all  being  (Burke,  p.132).      At  the  heart  of  Burke's  understanding  of  identification  is  the  notion  of  division   (Burke,  1969).  Because  division  exists  between  the  speaker  and  his  or  her  opponent   (and  his  or  her  audience),  there  is  a  need  for  the  speaker  to  identify  with  their   surroundings  and  present  their  position  accordingly.  If  the  various  parties  involved   in  debates  were  not  separated  by  some  opinion  or  belief,  there  would  be  no  need  to   find  common  ground  with  which  to  identify  with  one  another,  and,  ultimately,   attempt  to  persuade  one  another.  Therefore,  Burke's  inclusion  of  identification            9  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   when  conceptualizing  rhetoric  acts  as  a  useful  basis  when  identifying  `Emotional'   rhetoric  and  the  shared  means  of  persuasion  amongst  the  speakers.        Group  2:   Numerous  theorists  have  applied  rhetoric  to  the  study  of  religious  discourse  and   public  deliberation  (Booth,  1985;  Eisenhart,  2006;  Gitay,  1983,  2001,  2005,  2009;   Perelman,  1969,  1982;  Smith,  2008;  Williams  &  Alexander,  1994).  Gitay  examines   the  use  of  rhetoric  in  Religious  Rhetoric  and  Public  Deliberation:  Preliminary   Thoughts  (2001)  and  makes  an  important  distinction:  religion  can  either  serve  as  a   means  to  support  an  argument  ­"means  of  persuasion,"  (Gitay,  2001,  p.  54)  ­  or  can   be  the  issue  about  which  one  is  arguing.  Gitay  demonstrates  this  distinction  through   two  anti-racism  speeches  given  in  2000  by  then  President  of  South  Africa,  Thabo   Mbeki.  When  addressing  a  religious  crowd,  Mbeki  adopted  religion  and  scriptural   authority  as  a  means  to  oppose  racism.  Conversely,  when  speaking  to  a  more  secular   crowd  at  a  national  assembly,  Mbeki  opposed  the  same  issue  on  the  grounds  of   human  rights  violation;  a  means  of  persuasion  more  likely  to  resonate  with  the   audience.  Gitay  concludes  that  delivering  a  message  persuasively  requires   foreknowledge  of  the  audience's  position,  worldview,  or  bias,  followed  by  the   adaption  of  one's  argumentative  premise  accordingly.  If  the  audience  disagrees  with   the  speaker's  means  of  persuasion  ­  whether  it  be,  as  in  the  case  above,  religious  or   human  rights  ­  they  are  unlikely  to  be  convinced,  regardless  of  how  logical  the   argument  or  how  compelling  the  speaker.  The  distinction  made  by  Gitay  is  directly   applicable  to  the  god  debates  as  it  provides  a  framework  with  which  to  detect  the            10  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   speakers'  preferred  means  of  persuasion,  which  ­  according  to  Gitay  ­should  reflect   the  means  of  persuasion  preferred  by  the  audience.  An  understanding  of  Gitay's   means  of  persuasion  is  useful  when  analyzing  the  categories  of  both  `Emotional'   rhetoric  and  `Rational'  rhetoric.      Another  argumentative  device  used  in  religious  rhetoric,  according  to  Gitay,  is  that   of  ridicule  (Gitay,  2001).  Gitay  understands  ridicule  to  be  a  tool  used  by  speakers  to   avoid  serious  debate  with  opponents  who  do  not  share  or  accept  their  premise.   When  faced  with  such  a  situation,  it  is  common  for  speakers  to  dismiss  outright   their  opponent's  argument,  and  in  so  doing  indicate  the  superficiality  of  the  position   in  question  (Gitay,  2001).  This  rhetorical  technique  can  also  be  found  in  the  god   debates,  namely  within  the  category  of  `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric.      Again  exploring  the  relationship  between  religious  discourse  and  rhetoric,  Gitay,  in   Biblical  Rhetoric:  The  Art  of  Religious  Dialogue  (2009),  defines  religious  rhetoric  as   being  "derived  from  the  specific  cases  when  there  is  no  agreement  or  causal  link   between  the  claim  and  the  conclusion"  (Gitay,  2009,  p.  4).  He  further  outlined  the   difference  between  analytical  reasoning,  as  based  on  undisputable  and  impersonal   facts  and  data,  and  dialectical  reasoning,  as  based  on  justifiable  opinion.  Gitay   argued  that  dialectical  reasoning  derives  its  value  from  convincing  others  or  acting   on  the  minds  of  others.  Furthermore,  he  suggested  that  dialectical  reasoning  can  be   understood  as  the  "realm  of  rhetoric,"  beginning  with  concepts  or  theses  that  are   considered  universally  accepted,  such  as  universal  morals,  and  then  attempting  to            11  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   gain  support  and  acceptance  of  other  potentially  competing  or  controversial  theses.   The  concept  of  analytical  reasoning  is  highly  influential  in  identifying  rhetorical   appeals  to  rationality  and  factual  knowledge  (`Rational'  rhetoric),  and  the  concept  of   dialectical  reasoning  serves  as  a  valuable  contributor  to  the  understanding  and   identification  of  `Emotional'  rhetoric,  specifically,  enthymemes.      

Robert  Wuthnow  (1988)  also  used  rhetoric  as  a  theoretical  framework  to  view   religious  discourse.  Operating  primarily  from  an  analysis  of  the  bible,  he  identified  a   paradoxical  quality  of  religious  discourse,  whereby  on  the  one  hand,  it  is  self- referential  and  based  on  an  internal  logic  ("centripetal"),  while  on  the  other  hand,  it   conveys  a  broad,  metaphorical  meaning  that  is  open  to  interpretation  ("centrifugal")   (Wuthnow,  1988,  p.324).  The  end  result  is  a  discourse  that  "can  never  be  reduced  to   single  doctrinal  statements,  but  requires  re-creative  action  and  thought  to  the  point   that  it  becomes  too  complex  to  understand"  (Northrop  Frye,  as  found  in  Wuthnow,   1988,  p.  326).  Wuthnow  argued  that  when  these  opposing  tendencies  are  held  in   tension,  religious  discourse  becomes  difficult  to  understand  and  even  more  difficult   to  challenge  (Wuthnow,  1988).  The  rhetorical  insights  provided  by  Wuthnow  prove   useful  when  identifying  the  kinds  of  religious  rhetoric  used  in  the  god  debates,   particularly  regarding  `Religious'  rhetoric  and  personal  experiences  of  the  divine.    

Crismore  &  Vande  Kopple,  in  Rhetorical  Contexts  and  Hedges  (1990),  explore  an   element  of  rhetoric  that  ­  while  not  necessarily  linked  to  religious  discourse  ­  plays            12  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   an  important  role  in  public  debate  and  argument  delivery.  Hedges  are  defined  as   "linguistic  elements  such  as  perhaps,  might,  to  a  certain  extent,  and  it  is  possible   that,"  which  can  add  a  "judgment  of  truth  or  probability  to  referential  information"   and  which  can  be  either  personal  ("I  think  it  is  possible  that")  or  impersonal  ("It  is   possible  that")  (Crismore  &  Vande  Kopple,  1990,  p.  49).  In  their  study,  which  looks  at   the  effects  of  hedges  on  students  who  encounter  them  in  textbooks,  Crismore  &   Vande  Kopple  point  out  that  although  hedges  have  the  potential  to  rob  messages  of   their  power  and  certainty  ­  especially  factual  material  ­  non-factual  material  might   stand  to  benefit  from  hedges:  "Hedges  can  help  keep  prose  responsible  because   authors  are  then  `up  front'  about  what  they  are  less  than  certain"  (Crismore  &  Vande   Kopple,  1990,  p.  49).    This  understanding  provides  the  theoretical  foundation  for  the   `Hedging'  rhetoric  category.        David  J.  Tietge,  in  Rational  Rhetoric:  The  Role  of  Science  in  Popular  Discourse,   explores  how  and  for  what  reasons  science  communicates  to  large  and  often  non- scientific  audiences  (Tietge,  2008).  Tietge  situates  rationality  at  the  heart  of   scientific  rhetoric,  explaining  that  while  the  scientific  process  can  never  be   completely  objective,  "[t]he  positivistic  strain  of  empiricism  and  analytical   rationality  that  informs  the  scientific  methodology  is  a  large  part  of  its  mystical   allure,  because  while  the  rest  of  us  struggle  with  the  irrational,  emotional,  and   discriminatory  (in  the  most  anti-intellectual  sense),  science  remains  aloof,   transcendent  of  the  more  primal  impulses  that  taint  other  forms  of  discourse"   (Tietge,  2008,  p.189).  This  insight  into  scientific  discourse  ­  namely  the  eschewing            13  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   of  objectivity  and  the  recognition  of  rationality  ­  informs  the  definition  and  analysis   of  `Rationality'  rhetoric.      Tietge  also  explores  the  connection  between  the  Aristotlean  appeal  of  ethos  and  the   tradition  of  scientific  rhetoric  (Teitge,  2008).  Understood  as  a  key  ingredient  in   audience  persuasion,  ethos  is  comprised  of  many  components,  including  "the   cumulative  effect  of  a  speaker's  (or  writer's  or  communicator's)  personality,  dress,   manner,  status,  authority,  and  presumed  level  of  expertise,"  (Teitge,  2008,  p.173).   Furthermore,  scientific  ethos  is  said  to  include  appeals  to  other  authorities:  "The   ethos  of  the  scientist  is  enhanced  by  the  collective  ethos  of  the  references  offered  as   patrols  to  guard  a  particular  claim.  Here  we  see  a  symbolic  accumulation  of  `friends'   in  the  form  of  many  supporting  texts,  and  these  textual  collaborators  represent  a   well-established  corpus  of  knowledge  that  is  intimidating  and  well-defended,"   (Teitge,  2008,  p.173).  Although  the  present  analysis  will  not  explore  the  speakers'   personality  or  dress,  Teitge's  discussion  of  scientific  ethos  informs  both  the   categories  of  `Scientific'  rhetoric  and  `Credibility'  rhetoric.    

Group  3:      The  ideological  divide  between  theism  and  atheism  positions  incommensurability   theory  as  an  appropriate  theoretical  background  with  which  to  analyze  the   arguments  used  and  the  potential  for  compatibility  in  the  god  debates.  As  such,  I   turn  first  to  the  seminal  work  of  Thomas  Kuhn,  The  Structure  of  Scientific   Revolutions  (1996),  in  which  he  argued  that  scientific  revolutions  have  historically            14  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   split  scientists  into  two  camps,  those  who  embrace  the  breakthroughs  and  their   implications,  and  those  who  refuse  to  accept  the  new  hypotheses.  Kuhn  further   argued  that  the  proponents  of  opposing  scientific  paradigms  are  unable  to   completely  appreciate  each  other's  perspective  due  to  incongruent  priorities,   vocabulary,  and  training:  "incommensurability  signifies  the  idea  that  there  is  no   common  measure  among  paradigms  of  inquiry,  so  that  the  inhabitants  of  paradigms   `live  in  different  worlds,'  hold  `mutually  exclusive  beliefs,'  and/or  employ  `differing   language  games'  (Wight,  1996,  p.  291).  Although  Kuhn  used  the  metaphor  of  the   `gestalt  switch'  to  convey  the  immediacy  of  a  realized  scientific  revolution,  he  also   posited  that  wholesale  conversions  among  individuals  or  groups  can  happen   gradually  ­  and  sometimes  not  at  all.  Nonetheless,  meaningful  communication  is   said  to  depend  on  the  collective  embrace  of  some  substantial  shift:  "before  they   hope  to  communicate  fully,  one  group  or  the  other  must  experience  the  conversion   that  we  have  been  calling  a  paradigm  shift"  (Kuhn,  1996,  p.  150).  When  applied  to   the  context  of  the  god  debates,  Kuhn's  theory  of  incommensurability  offers  a   framework  with  which  to  detect  evidence  of  commensurability  or   incommensurability  among  the  opposing  speakers.      Next  in  this  group  is  Amani  Albedah's  A  Gadamerian  Critique  of  Kuhn's  Linguistic   Turn:  Incommensurability  Revisited  (2006),  a  study  that  explores  both  Kuhn's  and   German  philosopher  Hans  Georg  Gadamer's  approaches  to  incommensurability.   Although  Gadamer  generally  agreed  with  Kuhn's  position,  he  believed  that  Kuhn's   `gestalt  shift'  metaphor  failed  to  account  for  the  ways  in  which  commensurability            15  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   can  be  achieved  "by  jointly  developing  new  understandings  of  areas  where   paradigms  are  most  similar  or  overlap"  (Delaney,  2011).  Albedah  also  challenges  the   incommensurability  thesis  as  put  forth  by  Kuhn,  claiming  that  it  fails  to  "bridge  the   apparent  gap  between  incommensurability  and  understanding"  (Albedah,  324).     Moreover,  Albedah  calls  into  question  the  alternative  understanding  of   incommensurability  as  put  forth  by  Kuhn's  "adversaries",  who  assume  a  wholesale   absence  of  understanding  between  two  removed  languages  (Albedah,  324).  Albedah   instead  favored  the  historical  reflexivity  and  "dialogical  openness"  of  Gadamer's   hermeneutics  ­  necessary  to  avoid  communication  breakdown  ­  though  ultimately   makes  a  case  for  the  fundamental  likeness  of  the  two  approaches.  Albadeh's  study   provides  a  close  reading  of  Kuhn's  work  that  aids  in  applying  incommensurability  to   the  analysis  of  the  arguments  used  in  the  god  debates.                                                 16  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   METHODOLOGY      To  analyze  the  debates,  I  conducted  a  modified  grounded  theory  analysis.   Grounded  theory  is  an  effective  model  for  analyzing  qualitative  data  in  which   "[c]ategories  develop  through  an  ongoing  process  of  comparing  units  of  data  with   each  other"  (Lindlof  &  Taylor,  2011,  p.250).  In  this  model,  definitions  of  the   categories  and  codes  that  emerge  from  the  data  continuously  evolve  as  increasing   amounts  of  data  are  analyzed  (Lindlof  &  Taylor,  2011,  p.250).  This  dynamic  process   allows  room  for  some  categories  to  "originate  in  concepts  and  issues  from  the   research  literature"  (Lindlof  &  Taylor,  2011,  p.250),  although  the  primary  thrust  of   grounded  theory  emphasizes  the  identification  of  categories  from  direct  contact   with  the  data.  The  conceptual  definitions  in  the  present  study  are  informed  both  by   the  literature  review  and  the  salient  qualities  and  stylistic  features  of  the  emergent   concepts.  Once  the  coding  was  finalized,  the  data  was  transferred  from  the   transcripts  into  three  codebooks  ­  one  for  each  debate  ­  comprised  of  (1)  broad   category,  (2)  specific  concept,  (3)  definition,  and  (4)  examples.  The  examples  were   color-coded  to  identify  theist  speakers  (red)  and  atheist  speakers  (green);  this  color   scheme  is  also  used  in  the  tables  below.                                         17  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   DATA  COLLECTION        My  research  paper  will  examine  three  god  debates.  In  order  to  qualify  as  a  `god   debate,'  for  the  purposes  of  my  study,  the  following  inclusion  criteria  were  met:  (1)   the  debate  must  have  been  conducted  in  English,  (2)  the  debate  must  have  occurred   after  2000,  (3)  the  debate  must  be  between  a  prominent  theist  supporter  and  a   prominent  atheist  supporter,  (4)  the  debate  must  be  about  the  existence  of  god,  (4)   the  debate  must  be  conducted  in  front  of  a  live  audience,  and  (5)  the  debate  must  be   freely  available  online  in  its  entirety.          The  primary  site  of  my  data  collection  was  YouTube.  Because  the  majority  of  god   debates  are  filmed,  they  are  often  uploaded  to  free  streaming  sites  such  as  YouTube.   As  only  one  of  the  debates  I  chose  to  analyze  had  a  full  transcript  available,  I   transcribed  the  remaining  two  myself.  In  order  to  transcribe  the  debates,  I  first   download  them  from  YouTube  with  a  free  program  called  GetTube.  GetTube  captures   video  files  and  converts  them  into  MP4  video  files,  which  can  then  be  viewed   through  a  media  player  such  as  iTunes.  Having  the  entire  debates  downloaded   allowed  for  access  at  any  time,  regardless  of  the  availability  of  an  Internet   connection.  Although  I  did  capture  some  obvious  vocal  tics  and  speaker  pauses,  the   goal  with  my  transcriptions  was  to  meticulously  capture  every  word  used  in  the   debates,  including  moderator  comments  and  audience  questions.      The  debates  have  been  selected  to  reflect  the  recent  wave  of  god  debates  by            18

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   RESULTS        My  analysis  of  the  god  debates  addresses  two  overarching  issues.  First,  I  identified   the  rhetorical  strategies  ­  or  kinds  of  arguments  ­  that  were  employed  by  both  sides   to  persuade  the  audiences.  Though  some  the  strategies  identified  will  likely  come  as   no  surprise  (e.g.  religion  critiquing  atheism  and  vice-versa),  they  are  included  so  as   to  provide  a  comprehensive  picture  of  how  the  opposing  speakers  support  their   positions.  Second,  I  discussed  the  frequency  of  the  arguments  used,  and  what  their   usage  revealed  about  the  ability  of  the  opposing  speakers  to  "communicate  fully"   (Kuhn,  1996,  p.150).  In  both  stages  of  the  analysis,  I  viewed  the  findings  from  the   three  debates  as  a  single  data  set  comprised  of  `theist  speakers'  and  `atheist   speakers.'      The  following  section  will  address  my  first  research  question  and  provide  the  basis   upon  which  to  proceed  to  the  deeper  analysis  of  my  second  question.  My  first   question  is:  What  kinds  of  rhetorical  strategies  are  used  in  the  recent  wave  of  god   debates?  My  initial  analysis  identified  eight  broad  categories  that  emerged  from  the   debates  (See  Table  1  below).  Each  category  contains  a  number  of  defined  concepts   with  pertinent  examples  (See  Findings).                        21

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   Findings:   1. `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric   a)  Compatibility  of  religion  and  science   The  positioning  of  science  and  religion  as  compatible  and   complementary.  Stylistic  features  of  this  strategy  include  the  following:   mentioning  of  both  science  and  religion,  use  of  scientific  terms  (ie.   evidence,  claim,  skeptical  inquiry,  constitute),  use  of  examples  of   historical  parallelism,  agreeing  with  points  made  by  opponents,  and  the   use  of  the  following  terms:  `agree',  `compatible',  `synergy',  `friendship,'  `co- exist,'  and  `common.'   Examples:   · Science  and  religion  weren't  classically  in  opposition,  except  in   certain  specific  instances,  and  even  those  instances  are  much  more   complicated  than  we  suspect.  You  know,  Galileo  and  the  Pope,   Pope  Urban,  were  friends.  And  there  is  a  friendship  issue  as  well  as   a  lot  of  political  issues  that  were  involved  in  Galileo's  eventual   recantation,  it  wasn't  just  that  there  was  faith  over  here  and  there   was  Galileo  over  there,  and  in  fact  there  were  people  in  the  church   who  agreed  with  Galileo,  and  Newton  was  a  devout  Christian  as   you  may  know,  and  the  relation  between  science  and  religion   wasn't  classically  just  oppositional,  was  sometimes  oppositional,   but  more  often  synergistic,  but  people  believed  that  they  co- existed,  as  they  should  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).   Science  and  religion  ought  to  be  able  to  co-exist  (Wolpe,  Does  God   Exist,  2007).   Please  note  that  what  divides  us  is  not  science,  we  are  both   committed  to  it  (Lennox,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   b)  Incompatibility  of  religion  and  science   The  positioning  of  science  and  religions  as  incompatible.  This  rhetorical   strategy  tends  to  be  used  to  demonstrate  shortcomings  of  the  opposition,   ridicule  the  opposition,  or  demonstrate  the  incompatibility  of  the  two   positions.  Stylistic  features  of  this  strategy  include  the  use  of  scientific   terms  (e.g.  antidote,  falsifiable,  good  science,  causes,  claims,  biology,   evidence),  and  oppositional  phrases  such  as:  at  odds;  trespass;  erosion;   rival;  naïve;  anti-scientific;  against;  not  scientific  claims  (Gitay,  2001).   Examples:   ·    ·    · We  only  need  to  use  the  word  faith  when  there  isn't  any  evidence   (Dawkins,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).   The  dialogue  between  science  and  religion  has  gone  this  way:  it   has  been  one  of  relentless  and  one-directional  erosion  of  religious   authority  (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).   The  existence  of  god  is  not  a  scientific  claim  (Wolpe,  Does  God   Exist,  2007).      In  the  world  we're  not  in  a  position  where  there's  only  one   explanation  contending,  there  are  rival  explanations.  There  is  a   theist  explanation  ­  the  God  explanation  ­  and  there  is  a  non- theist,  or  atheist  explanation.  We  have  to  weigh  the  two  against   each  other  (D'Souza,  The  God  Debate,  2010).

Abraham,  the  point  of  the  Abraham  story,  according  to  many   commentators,  which  I  take  to  be  true,  is  precisely  to  say  that   although  the  gods  of  the  world  up  to  that  time  do  demand  human   sacrifice,  god  doesn't  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).      · Every  religious  text  is  a  text  that  gets  interpreted  through  a   community  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).         4. `Distinguishing'  rhetoric   a)  Differences  between  religious  viewpoints     The  positioning  of  religion  as  a  heterogeneous  body  of  thought  and   practice,  with  beliefs  ranging  from  the  `moderate'  to  the  `fundamental.'   This  rhetorical  strategy  is  often  used  to  differentiate  between  viewpoints   within  and  between  religions.  Stylistic  features  include  the  use  of  the   following  terms:  form  of  religion;  particular  brand;  good  religion;  bad   religion;  kind  of  religion;  moderates;  only  a  minority;  militant;  blind  faith.   Examples:   · I  could  never  claim  that  I  had  religion  thrust  down  my  throat  in  the   way  it  might  have  been  had  I  been  brought  up  in  a  more  militant   faith  (Dawkins,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).      It  is  healthy  religion  that  provides  the  only  hope  for  sick  religion  to   be  well  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).   Not  all  faith  is  blind  faith  (Lennox,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   b)  Differences  between  atheist/secular  viewpoints     The  positioning  of  atheism/secularism  as  a  heterogeneous  body  of   thought  and  practice.  This  rhetorical  strategy  is  often  used  to   differentiate  between  viewpoints  within  science  and  atheism,  as  well  as   to  identify  the  diversity  of  views  within  atheist  thought.  Stylistic  features   include  the  use  of  the  following  terms:  differentiate;  part  company.   Examples:   ·    ·    You  rightly  expect  me  to  differentiate  between  atheists  (Lennox,   The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).   I  part  company  with  many  atheists  in  that  I  am  interested  in   spiritual  experience  (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).     

   5. `Rational'  rhetoric   a)  Appeal  to  rationality   The  positioning  of  an  argument  as  being  based  on  rationality  or  reason.   This  rhetorical  strategy  tends  to  use  the  language  of  science  and  tends  to   be  presented  in  a  non-personal  manner  (Tietge,  2008).  Stylistic  features   include  the  use  of  the  following  terms:  process;  reasoning;  rigorous;  fact;   authenticate;  reasonableness;  argument;  common  sense;  false  analogy;   true;  understand;  postulate;  standard.   Examples:   ·    · Either  one  of  them  is  completely  true  ­  as  the  Roman  Church  used   to  say,  it  was  the  one  true  church,  some  of  its  members  still  do  ­  or            33   In  order  to  understand  the  existence  of  complexity,  we  can't  just   postulate  complexity  (Dawkins,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   all  of  them  are  false;  or  all  of  them  are  true,  which,  of  course,  can't   be  true  (Hitchens,  The  God  Debate,  2010).   ·    ·    In  this  debate  at  no  time  will  I  make  any  arguments  that  appeal  to   revelation,  scripture,  or  authority.  I'll  make  arguments  based  on   reason  alone  (D'Souza,  The  God  Debate,  2010).   Let's  supply  the  reasonable  standard:  If  we  see  a  fine-tuned   universe,  what's  more  likely,  someone  fine-tuned  it,  or  it  fine- tuned  itself?  (D'Souza,  The  God  Debate,  2010)  

  

b)  Appeal  to  factual  knowledge   The  positioning  of  an  argument  as  being  based  on  facts  or  indisputable   data.  This  rhetorical  strategy  tends  to  use  impersonal  language  and   numerical  evidence.  Stylistic  features  include  the  use  of  the  following   terms:  objective  facts;  right  and  wrong;  know;  truth  claims;  basis  in  the   brain;  understand.      Examples:   ·    · We  now  understand  essentially  how  life  came  into  being.  We  know   that  we  are  all  cousins  of  all  animals  and  plants,  we  know  that   we're  descendant  from  a  common  ancestor  which  might  have  been   something  like  bacteria  (Dawkins,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).   We  know  that  almost  everything  you  take  yourself  to  be,  as  a   matter  of  subjectivity,  has  its  basis  in  the  brain  (Harris,  Does  God   Exist,  2007).      If  you  change  that,  not  10%  or  1%,  but  one  part  in  a  hundred   thousandth  millionth  million,  we  would  have  no  universe,  we   would  have  no  life  (D'Souza,  The  God  Debate,  2010).      98%  of  all  human  beings  who  ever  lived  have  had  an  intuitive   sense  that  there  is  something  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   6. `Hedging'  rhetoric   a)  Subjective  argument   The  positioning  of  an  argument  in  somewhat  uncertain  terms,  terms   based  on  probability,  or  with  qualifiers  (Crismore  &  Vande  Kopple,  1990).   Stylistic  features  of  this  rhetorical  strategy  include  the  use  of  personal   pronouns  and  the  use  of  the  following  terms:  I  think;  I  don't  think;  I   believe;  how  I  feel;  my  experience;  my  faith;  my  understanding;  we;   perhaps;  to  a  certain  extent;  maybe.   Examples:   · ·    ·       b)  Admission  of  uncertainty   The  positioning  of  an  argument  as  being  based  on  partial  knowledge.   Often  seen  as  a  virtue  in  scientific  discourse,  this  rhetorical  strategy  uses   the  following  terms  to  express  lack  of  knowledge:  we  don't  fully   understand;  uncertainties  remain;  yet  to  fully  characterize;  with  one   exception;  gaps;  don't  know  (Crismore  &  Vande  Kopple,  1990).   Examples:   · I'm  certainly  open  to  the  possibility  that  we  have  yet  to  fully   characterize  the  good  life  (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).      I  believe...  (Hitchens,  The  God  Debate,  2010).      I  said  my  experience  of  certain  human  beings  (Wolpe,  Does  God   Exist,  2007).   I  think  that  one  thing  to  notice  is...  (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,   2007).

      7. `Emotional'  rhetoric   a)  Appeal  to  audience   A  direct  appeal  to  the  audience.  This  rhetorical  strategy  draws  the   audience  into  the  debate  and  challenges  them  to  engage  with  the   argument  being  presented  (Gitay,  2001;  Burke,  1969).  Stylistic  features   include  posing  questions  to  the  audience,  and  the  use  of  the  following   terms:  ladies  and  gentlemen;  I  want  you  to  know;  for  you  to  notice;  how   many  people  in  this  room...;  just  think  of  how...;  it  should  be  obvious  to  all   of  you;  anybody  who  has  children...;  raise  your  hand;  we;  you.   Examples:   · We've  met  tonight  at  an  institution  of  higher  learning,  and  the   greatest  obligation  that  you  have  is  to  keep  an  open  mind   (Hitchens,  The  God  Debate,  2010).      Ladies  and  gentlemen...  (Lennox,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,   2008).      I'm  just  curious,  how  many  of  you  eat  meat?  Just  raise  your   hand  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).   This  is  something  I  want  you  to  all  know;  before  we  talk  on   that  level,  I  want  kind  of  a  big  picture  view  for  you  all  to  notice   (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   b)  Enthymeme   An  appeal  to  what  the  audience  already  partially  believes  to  be  true.  This   rhetorical  strategy  uses  deductive  arguments  with  unstated  assumptions   that  must  be  true  for  the  premises  to  lead  to  the  conclusion  (Gitay,  2009;   Craig  &  Muller,  2007).  It  also  relies  on  justifiable  opinion  rather  than   empirically  sound  claims.  Stylistic  features  include  posing  questions  to   the  audience  and  framing  statements  as  though  they  are  truths.   Examples:   ·    · There  are  enormous  numbers  of  competing  religions,  it's   another  reason  that  it's  obvious  to  me  that  they're  man-made   (Hitchens,  The  God  Debate,  2010).   Why  do  we  have  a  cell  that  shows  the  structure  of  complexity?   Because  the  cell  has  been  intelligently  designed  perhaps  by  an   intelligent  designer.  Why  does  the  universe  show  complexity   and  rationality?  Well,  those  are  the  characteristics  of  the   creator  who  made  it  that  way  (D'Souza,  The  God  Debate,  2010).   Created  gods  are  by  definition  a  delusion  (Lennox,  The  God   Delusion  Debate,  2008).   Clearly  9/11  did  something  to  our  discourse  (Harris,  Does  God   Exist,  2007).

8. `Credibility'  rhetoric   a)  Referencing  other  people   Evoking  feelings  of  credibility  within  an  argument  by  referencing  other   people;  including  scientific  experts,  religious  figures,  historical  figures,   scholars,  and  philosophers  (Tietge,  2008).  This  rhetorical  strategy   sometimes  includes  a  quotation  from  the  author,  or  a  paraphrased   passage  from  their  body  of  work.

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   Examples:   ·    · I  brought  a  quote.  This  is  from  Viktor  Frankl,  who  is  a  survivor   and  a  therapist  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).   Some  people  say  the  great  Stephen  Jay  Gould  ­  who  I  admired   very  much,  from  whom  we  all  learned  a  great  deal  about   evolutionary  biology  ­  used  to  say...  (Hitchens,  The  God  Debate,   2010).   One  of  the  most  famous  statements  that  Jesus  ever  made  was:  I   am  the  truth.  An  astonishing  assertion  that  as  CS  Lewis  pointed   out  long  ago,  is  either  megalomaniac,  pathologically  mistaken,   or  valid  (Lennox,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   ANALYSIS      The  following  section  will  address  the  second  research  question:  What  does  the   frequency  of  usage  of  the  rhetorical  strategies  tell  us  about  the  ability  of  the  opposing   parties  to  engage  in  meaningful  communication?        The  first  category,  `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric,  was  the  most  commonly  used   type  of  rhetoric  in  the  god  debates  with  247  instances  identified.  Although  the   opposing  speakers  nearly  split  the  total  ­  theist  with  117  instances,  atheist  with  130   instances  ­  the  usage  of  the  concepts  within  the  category  is  strikingly  dissimilar.  The   first  concept  within  the  category,  (1a)  `compatibility  of  religion  and  science'  was  put   forth  only  by  the  theist  speakers,  with  23  instances  (See  Table  3).  Not  surprisingly,   the  second  concept,  (1b)  `incompatibility  of  religion  and  science,'  was  used  both  by   the  atheist  speakers  and  theist  speakers,  30  and  22  times  respectively  (See  Table  3).   Thus,  while  the  theist  speakers  attempted  to  persuade  the  audiences  by  both   aligning  and  distancing  theism  from  science  and/or  atheism,  the  atheist  speakers   exclusively  highlighted  the  differences  between  the  opposing  paradigms.        The  third  concept,  (1c)  `critique  of  religion  and/or  faith,'  was  used  primarily  by  the   atheist  speakers,  at  68  uses.  The  theist  speakers,  on  the  other  hand,  were  only   critical  of  faith-based  positions  7  times  (See  Table  3).  Similarly,  the  fourth  concept,   (1d)  `critique  of  atheism/secularism  and/or  science,'  was  used  exclusively  by  the   theist  speakers,  at  38  uses  (See  Table  3).  These  results  ­  while  not  particularly            43  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   useful,  and  perhaps  intuitive  ­  indicate  that  the  speakers  on  both  sides  of  the   debates  employed  critique-based  rhetorical  strategies  (1c,  1d)  as  the  most  common   forms  of  `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric,  often  using  ridicule  (Gitay,  2001)  as  a   means  of  delegitimizing  oppositional  views:  "The  proposition  is  that  if  you  damage  a   brain  a  little  bit,  you  destroy  English  and  the  ability  to  recognize  faces,  but  if  you   damage  it  totally  at  death,  the  soul  ­  low  and  behold,  still  able  to  recognize  Gramma   ­  will  rise  off  the  brain,  and  go  into  a  tunnel  of  light.  These  are  scientific  claims  and   they  are  profoundly  naïve"  (Harris,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).      The  fifth  concept,  (1e)  `associating  religion  with  violence  and  injustice,'  garnered  31   uses  by  the  atheist  speakers  and  only  4  uses  by  the  theist  speakers  (See  Table  3).   Conversely,  the  sixth  concept,  (1f)  `associating  atheism/secularism  with  violence   and  injustice,'  yielded  only  one  use  by  the  atheist  speakers  though  was  used  23   times  by  the  theist  speakers  (See  Table  3).  Much  like  the  previous  two  concepts,   these  predictable  results  suggest  that  both  the  theist  and  atheist  speakers  used  the   same  general  strategy  ­  `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric  ­  to  illustrate  links  between   their  opponents  and  injustice:  "It  seems  to  me  that  if  you  want  to  find  intolerance,   you  look  for  atheistic  regimes.  Would  you  rather  live  in  North  Korea  or  South   Korea?"  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).      The  fairly  predictable  results  from  the  first  broad  category,  `Comparative  or  Attack'   rhetoric,  seem  to  suggest  at  least  some  level  of  incommensurability  between  the   opposing  speakers.  Understood  as  "[t]he  impossibility  of  translating  between            44  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   different  points  of  view  or  measuring  them  by  a  common  standard"  (Craig  &  Muller,   2007,  p.499),  incommensurability  is  evidenced  in  four  main  ways:  (1)  the  opposing   speakers'  inability  to  agree  on  the  compatibility  of  their  positions  (1a),  (2)  the   opposing  speakers'  agreement  on  the  incompatibility  of  their  positions  (1b),  (3)  the   almost  completely  one-sided  critique  of  the  opposing  positions  (1c,  1d),  and  (4)  the   nearly  exclusive  association  of  the  opposing  position  with  violence  and  injustice  (1e,   1f).  Kuhn's  (1996)  argument  of  the  necessity  for  a  collective  embrace  of  some  new   hypothesis  ­  necessary  for  full  and  meaningful  communication  between  competing   paradigms  ­  appears  not  realized  in  this  first  category.  Although  the  opposing   speakers  both  rely  on  the  same  rhetorical  strategies  (e.g.,  attack-based  rhetoric),  the   results  from  `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric  seem  to  demonstrate  conflicting   positions  that  `hold  mutually  exclusive  beliefs,'  and  that  `live  in  different  worlds   (Wight,  1996,  p.  291).        Also  unsurprising,  the  second  category,  `Scientific'  rhetoric,  was  used  almost   exclusively  by  the  atheist  speakers.  The  first  concept  within  the  category,  (2a)   `praising  the  scientific  method,'  was  used  25  times  by  the  atheist  speakers  and  only   one  time  by  the  theist  speakers  (See  Table  4).  The  second  concept,  (2b)   `atheism/secularism  as  a  force  for  good,'  was  used  exclusively  by  the  atheist   speakers,  at  30  uses  (See  Table  4).  These  results  speak  to  the  fact  that  although  the   theist  speakers  highlighted  the  `compatibility  of  science  and  religion'  (See  1a),  they   did  not  go  as  far  as  to  express  support  for  atheism  or  to  explicitly  praise  the   scientific  method  upon  which  the  atheist  speakers  base  their  beliefs  and  engender            45  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   credibility  (Tietge,  2008).  This  category  also  speaks  to  the  incommensurable  nature   of  the  arguments  presented  by  the  opposing  speakers  in  the  god  debates,  as  all  but   one  of  the  56  appeals  to  `Scientific'  rhetoric  were  put  forth  by  the  atheist  speakers:   "Science  uses  evidence  to  discover  the  truth  about  the  universe"  (Dawkins,  The  God   Delusion  Debate,  2008).      The  third  category,  `Religious'  rhetoric,'  yielded  almost  the  exact  opposite  results   from  `Scientific'  rhetoric,  with  52  of  the  58  instances  belonging  to  the  theist  speakers   (See  Table  5).  The  first  concept  within  the  category,  (3a)  `experiences  of  the  divine'   ­  influenced  by  Wuthnow's  discussion  of  religious  discourse  (1988)  ­  was  used   exclusively  by  the  theist  speakers,  at  15  uses  (See  Table  5).  The  second  concept,  (3b)   `religion  as  a  force  for  good,'  was  also  used  exclusively  by  the  theist  speakers,  at  19   uses  (See  Table  5).  Finally,  the  third  concept,  (3c)  `appeal  to  scriptural  authority,'   was  used  18  times  by  the  theist  speakers  (to  make  a  case  for  the  merits  of  religious   texts),  and  6  times  by  the  atheist  speakers  (to  illustrate  the  downsides  of  religious   texts)  (See  Table  5).  Thus,  `Religious'  rhetoric  illustrates  a  wholesale  divide  between   the  opposing  positions.  As  would  be  expected,  the  atheist  speakers'  appear   unwilling  to  accept  personal  religious  experiences,  faith-based  practices,  and/or   scripture  as  evidence  for  the  existence  of  god,  despite  the  theist  speakers'  appeal  to   these  concepts  as  a  means  of  supporting  their  beliefs:  "It's  not  that  someone  says  to   me:  `OK,  here  is  the  evidence  from  column  A  and  here  is  the  evidence  from  column   B;  now  which  one  do  you  decide  on?'  That's  not  how  you  decide  whether  you  believe   in  God  or  not"  (Wolpe,  Does  God  Exist,  2007).            46  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD      The  previous  two  categories,  `Scientific'  rhetoric  and  `Religious'  rhetoric,  predictably   speak  to  the  incommensurability  of  theism  and  atheism.  First,  not  once  in  all  three   debates  does  a  theist  speaker  recognize  atheism  as  a  force  for  good,  nor  does  an   atheist  speaker  recognize  theism  as  a  force  for  good.  Second,  there  are  no  instances   of  theist  speakers  explicitly  praising  the  scientific  method,  and  no  instances  of   atheist  speakers  citing  personal  experiences  of  the  divine  or  scriptural  authority2  as   evidence  for  the  existence  of  god.  These  categories  illustrate  the  absence  of  a   "common  measure"  with  which  to  provide  evidence  for  the  existence  or  absence  of   god:  "Proponents  of  two  incommensurable  paradigms  inevitably  use  incompatible   patterns  of  arrangements  of  the  shared  set  of  elements  (be  they  observations,  tools,   measurements,  terms,  or  theories)"  (Albedah,  2006,  p.  326).      The  fourth  category,  `Distinguishing'  rhetoric,  consists  of  two  concepts.  The  first   concept  within  the  category,  (4a)  `differences  between  religious  viewpoints,'  was   used  18  times  by  the  theist  speakers  and  3  times  by  the  atheist  speakers  (See  Table   6).  The  second  category,  (4b)  `differences  between  atheist/secular  viewpoints,'  was   used  4  times  by  the  theist  speakers  and  3  times  by  the  atheist  speakers  (See  Table   6).  Although  the  speakers  recognize  the  diversity  within  atheism  almost  equally,  the   theist  speakers  distinguish  the  differences  between  religions  far  more  frequently   than  do  the  atheist  speakers.  This  differentiation  is  often  used  to  distance  the                                                                                                                    2  Although  there  are  6  instances  where  atheist  speakers  refer  to  religious  texts,  it  is  always  in  the            47  

context  of  using  scripture  as  a  tool  to  demonstrate  the  implausibility  of  god's  existence  or  the  pitfalls   of  using  holy  books  as  moral  guides.    

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   moderate  religious  views  championed  by  the  theist  speakers  from  the  fundamental   religious  views  often  associated  with  ignorance  and  injustice:  "You  suggest  that   religion  builds  a  firewall  in  the  mind  against  scientific  truth.  Well  that  might  be   tragically  the  case  with  some  religions,  but  it's  not  so  with  biblical  Christianity"   (Lennox,  The  God  Delusion  Debate,  2008).  The  concepts  in  this  category  seem  to   suggest  some  evidence  for  argumentative  compatibility,  as  the  speakers  on  both   sides  recognize  the  diversity  within  their  opponents'  positions  and  challenge  their   opponents  with  these  distinctions  in  mind:  "I  would  not  for  a  moment  say  that  all   religion  is  bad,  all  religion  is  dangerous,  all  Christianity  is  dangerous,  certainly,  only   a  minority  of  religious  people  are  bad  or  do  bad  things"  (Dawkins,  The  God  Delusion   Debate,  2008).      The  speakers  on  both  sides  of  the  god  debates  rely  significantly  on  the  fifth  category,   `Rational'  rhetoric,  a  category  characterized  by  non-personal  appeals  to  analytical   reasoning  and  empirical  evidence  (Tietge,  2008).  The  first  concept  within  the   category,  (5a)  `appeal  to  rationality,'  is  used  30  times  by  the  theist  speakers  and  22   times  by  the  atheist  speakers  (See  Table  7).  The  second  concept,  (5b)  `appeal  to   factual  knowledge,'  however,  is  used  only  5  times  by  the  theist  speakers,  but   remains  popular  with  the  atheist  speakers,  at  29  uses  (See  Table  7).  The  overall  split   of  51  uses  of  `Rational'  rhetoric  by  the  atheist  speakers,  compared  to  35  uses  by  the   theist  speakers,  speaks  to  the  fact  that  the  `language'  of  rationality  or  reason   represents  something  of  a  common  language  in  the  debates.  As  Gitay  (2001)   described,  an  understanding  of  what  constitutes  an  effective  means  of  persuasion  is            48  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   key  when  successfully  positioning  an  argument,  and  ­  as  this  category  seems  to   suggest  ­  there  is  evidence  of  commensurability  regarding  the  shared  use  of   rationality  as  a  means  of  persuasion.  Although  the  theist  speakers  did  not  recognize   the  scientific  method  as  the  sole  means  for  validating  evidence  and  supporting  their   arguments  (2a),  their  use  of  rationality  as  the  common  language  within  the  debates   does  reflect  a  certain  recognition  that  in  order  for  an  argument  to  be  persuasive  ­   even  if  that  argument  is  for  a  divine  creator  ­  it  must  be  posed  in  secular,  scientific   language:  "What  could  be  more  appropriate  than  to  address  these  arguments  in  the   vocabulary  of  reason?  We  are  at  a  state  of  culture  in  which  we  have  to  use  rational   arguments  if  we  are  trying  to  communicate  in  secular  venues"  (D'Souza,  The  God   Debate,  2010).      The  sixth  category,  `Hedging'  rhetoric  ­  informed  by  Crismore  &  Vande  Kopple's   understanding  of  rhetorical  hedges  (1990)  ­  also  produced  interesting  results.  The   first  concept  with  the  category,  (6a)  `subjective  argument,'  yielded  equal  number  of   uses  between  the  opposing  positions  (See  Table  8).  This  willingness  to  preempt   one's  arguments  with  personal  pronouns  and  a  sense  of  probability  was  employed   by  both  sides  in  the  debate,  often  in  the  form  of  `I  think...,'  or  `In  my  experience....'   The  usage  of  `Hedging'  rhetoric  by  both  parties  seems  to  suggest  some  degree  of   commensurability  regarding  argument  delivery  and  oratorical  style.  The  second   category,  (6b)  `admission  of  uncertainty,'  on  the  other  hand,  was  used  exclusively  by   the  atheist  speakers  (See  Table  8).  This  speaks  to  a  fundamental  difference  between   the  participants  in  the  god  debates,  whereby  the  theist  speakers  tend  to  express  an            49

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   DISCUSSION      This  section  highlights  the  main  results  and  the  major  contributions  of  the  present   study.  It  concludes  with  some  limitations  and  suggestions  for  future  research.        As  is  discussed  in  the  analysis  of  the  categories  that  emerged  from  the  debates,   there  is  evidence  suggestive  of  both  argumentative  commensurability  and   incommensurability.  I  will  begin  by  discussing  the  main  evidence  for   commensurability.  First,  speakers  on  both  sides  of  the  debates  explicitly   acknowledged  the  diversity  within  their  opponents'  positions  and  used  the  names  of   current  or  historical  figures  to  evoke  feelings  of  credibility  when  presenting  an   argument.  This  rhetorical  tactic  is  related  to  Tietge's  discussion  of  "intertextuality"   as  a  form  of  scientific  ethos  that  evokes  feelings  of  expertise  and  authority  (Tietge,   2008,  p.178).  Also,  both  the  theist  and  atheist  speakers  presented  their  arguments   by  `hedging  their  bets'  with  personal  pronouns  and  linguistic  qualifiers  (Crismore  &   Vande  Kopple,  1990),  as  well  as  through  similar  styles  of  direct  appeal  to  the   audience  (Gitay,  2001).  Finally,  the  most  significant  evidence  for  commensurability   pertains  to  the  means  of  persuasion  (Gitay,  2001),  evident  in  the  secular  and   scientific  language  of  rationality  as  employed  by  both  sides.        The  analysis  of  the  god  debates  also  points  to  evidence  of  incommensurability   between  the  opposing  viewpoints.  To  begin,  `Comparative  or  Attack'  rhetoric  ­   routinely  adopted  as  a  technique  by  both  sides  ­  shows  clearly  (and  predictably)  the            52  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   fundamentally  divergent  nature  of  the  opposing  paradigms  in  question.  Out  of  the  6   concepts  within  this  category,  the  only  demonstrable  agreement  is  in  the   incompatibility  of  theism  and  atheism;  elsewhere,  the  tools  are  used  to  critique,   ridicule,  and  vilify  the  opponents'  position  (Gitay,  2001).  Incommensurability  is  also   evidenced  in  the  relatively  greater  use  of  logically  incomplete  arguments  ­  or   enthymemes  (Craig  &  Muller,  2007)  ­  by  the  theist  speakers,  and  in  the  admission  of   uncertainty,  which  reveals  the  incongruity  between  the  resolute  faith  of  the  theist   speakers  and  the  admitted  uncertainty  of  the  atheist  speakers.  Finally,  the  most   compelling  case  for  incommensurability  between  the  opposing  speakers  can  be   found  in  the  analyses  of  `Scientific'  rhetoric  and  `Religious'  rhetoric.  In  the  case  of   `Scientific'  rhetoric,  there  are  virtually  no  examples  of  the  theist  speakers  explicitly   acknowledging  the  merits  of  the  scientific  method  or  the  goodwill  of  atheism,  two   concepts  relied  upon  frequently  by  the  atheist  speakers  (as  would  be  expected).   Conversely,  in  the  case  of  `Religious'  rhetoric,  there  are  virtually  no  examples  of   atheist  speakers  accepting  personal  experiences  of  god,  the  utility  of  religion,  or  the   authority  of  holy  texts  as  evidence  for  the  existence  of  god;  evidence  used  often  by   the  theist  speakers  (again,  not  surprising).  Therefore,  despite  the  aforementioned   evidence  of  commensurability,  the  difficulty  of  engendering  full  and  meaningful   communication  between  the  theist  and  atheist  speakers  in  the  god  debates  is   palpable:  "The  proponents  of  competing  paradigms  are  always  at  least  slightly  at   cross  purposes"  (Kuhn,  1996,  p.  148).

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   These  results  speak  to  a  broader,  discursive  trend  within  the  context  of  the  god   debates:  the  positioning  of  rationality-based  arguments  and  scientific  language  as   the  primary  means  of  persuasion.  This  trend  plays  out  in  two  ways:  first,  through   the  complete  rejection  of  `Religious'  rhetoric  as  legitimate  evidence  on  the  part  of  the   atheist  speakers,  and  second,  through  the  general  adoption  of  `Rational'  rhetoric  on   the  part  of  the  theist  speakers.  This  trend  can  be  understood  as  a  sort  of  `double   movement';  that  is,  where  atheist  speakers  use  rationality-based  arguments  to   delegitimize  religious  forms  of  evidence  (e.g.,  personal  experiences  of  the  divine,   scriptural  authority),  the  theist  speakers  use  rationality3  to  defend  their  belief  in   existence  of  god.  In  other  words,  although  both  parties  use  rationality  to  support   their  arguments,  the  atheist  speakers  use  it  to  distance  themselves  from  religion,   while  the  theist  speakers  use  it  to  more  closely  align  themselves  with  the  scientific   logic  and  discourse  that  constitutes  the  kinds  of  evidence  accepted  by  the  atheist   speakers.  The  proposed  `double  movement,'  therefore,  can  be  understood  as  a  sort   of  rhetorical  `push  and  pull,'  whereby  the  atheist  speakers  push  away  from  theism,   while  the  theist  speakers  pull  closer  to  science.  This  suggests  that  both  sides,  at  least   to  a  certain  degree,  rely  on  the  same  rhetorical  tactic  to  convince  their  audience:  a   rational,  non-faith-based  epistemology.      The  present  research  paper  contributes  to  our  understanding  of  the  god  debates,   the  field  of  rhetoric,  and  the  field  of  professional  communication  in  a  number  of                                                                                                                   

3  Religious  forms  of  evidence  are  also  used  by  the  theist  speakers,  but  the  `double  movement'  refers  

to  the  kinds  of  evidence  and  arguments  that  are  collectively  recognized  and  used,  but  for  different   ends;  in  this  case,  rationality-based  rhetoric.

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   ways.  To  begin,  this  is  one  of  the  first  studies  ­  along  with  Blair  (2011)  &  Saxton   (2009)  ­  that  has  looked  explicitly  at  the  recent  wave  of  god  debates.  Chief  in  the   contribution  to  our  understanding  of  this  cultural  phenomenon  is  the  introduction   of  the  concept  of  the  `double  movement'  in  which  rationality-based  rhetoric  is  used   to  at  once  push  theism  away  from  science  and  pull  theism  closer  to  science.  The  next   major  contribution  of  this  study  relates  to  the  field  of  rhetoric.  As  the  rhetorical   analysis  conducted  in  the  present  study  was  one  of  modified  grounded  theory,  a   number  of  rhetorical  categories  emerged  from  the  data  itself.  Of  these,  one  category   was  explicitly  identified  and  defined  for  the  first  time  in  the  present  study:   `Distinguishing'  rhetoric.  Other  categories,  though  emergent  in  the  present  data,   were  informed  and  influenced  from  the  literature  review.  Finally,  the  present   research  paper  contributes  to  the  field  of  professional  communication  by   highlighting  the  importance  of  recognizing  how  a  shared  means  of  persuasion  can   be  employed  to  enhance  communication  notwithstanding  apparent  conflict.  Despite   the  existence  of  fundamentally  inconsistent  paradigms,  a  shared  `language'  of   discourse  can  help  to  ensure  at  least  some  degree  of  commensurability.  Such  a   realization  will  almost  certainly  be  useful  for  communications  practitioners  working   in  diverse  professional  environments  in  which  meaningful  communication  must  be   achieved  between  contrasting  viewpoints.        The  present  research  paper  also  presents  a  series  of  limitations.  Although  an   individual  analysis  of  each  debate  was  beyond  the  scope  of  this  study,  there  were   differences  between  the  frequency  of  speakers'  use  of  the  certain  rhetorical  tactics            55  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   on  the  same  side  of  the  issue  (e.g.  not  every  atheist  speaker  relied  on  the  same  kinds   of  arguments  to  the  same  degree).  Hence,  to  speak  of  the  `theist  speakers'  and   `atheist  speakers'  as  homogenous  groups  is  somewhat  misleading.  Future  analysis  of   god  debates  could  look  at  the  difference  between  the  use  of  rhetorical  tactics  among   the  theist  and  atheist  speakers.  The  second  shortcoming  deals  with  the  number  of   debates  analyzed.  Although  analyzing  three  debates  provides  a  substantial   introduction  to  the  issue,  the  inclusion  of  more  debates  would  allow  for  an  ever   more  nuanced  reading  of  the  argumentative  strategies  used  by  the  opposing   speakers.  Finally,  because  the  present  research  paper  was  focused  exclusively  on   the  debate  transcripts,  an  analysis  of  speaking  styles  and  audience  reaction  is   lacking.  Future  research  is  needed  to  examine  the  less  tangible  elements  that  may   provide  insight  into  the  effectiveness  of  particular  delivery  styles  and  the   persuasiveness  of  particular  arguments.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  looking   strictly  at  the  transcripts  allows  for  a  more  pure  engagement  with  the  arguments   presented,  free  of  stylistic  distraction.                                      56  

ARGUING  WITH  GOD   CONCLUSION      Driven  by  the  primary  research  questions,  the  rhetorical  discourse  analysis  in  the   present  research  paper  identified  the  tools  that  were  used  in  the  three  god  debates  ­   viewed  as  a  single  data  set  ­  and  discussed  what  the  frequency  of  their  usage   revealed  about  the  speakers'  ability  to  communicate  effectively  across  the   ideological  divide  of  theism  and  atheism.  Evidence  of  both  commensurability  and   incommensurability  was  apparent;  the  former  in  recognition  of  diversity,  stylistic   similarities,  and  a  shared  means  of  persuasion,  and  the  latter  in  one-sided  attack- based  rhetoric,  admission  of  uncertainty,  and  a  near  total  incongruity  regarding  the   constitution  of  evidence.  Based  on  these  findings,  a  `double  movement'  was   identified  in  which  the  atheist  speakers  appealed  exclusively  to  rationality-based   rhetoric  to  argue  against  the  existence  of  god,  while  the  theist  speakers  embraced   the  compatibility  of  the  opposing  positions  and  appealed  to  rationality-based   rhetoric  to  argue  for  the  existence  of  god.  Thomas  Kuhn's  incommensurability   theory  provides  a  framework  to  understand  the  inability  of  opposing  paradigms   with  "no  common  measure"  (Swerdlow,  2004,  p.84)  to  achieve  meaningful   communication.  Therefore,  based  on  the  findings  of  the  present  study  ­  in  which   similar  means  of  persuasion  are  used  to  support  dissimilar  conclusions  ­  it  appears   the  opposing  arguments  in  the  god  debates  are  at  once  commensurable  and   incommensurable.                       57

is  a  religious  claim,  not  a...   religion  is  based  on  the  notion  that  there   is  this  invisible  order  which  human   beings  can  participate  in,  that  is  ordained   by  something  that  is  transcendent,     God  is...  the  intangible  creator  of  the   universe  in  who's  presence  a  human   being  can  live  according  to  who's  dictates   or  will  a  human  being  can  live  in  this   world.     Do  you  understand?  It  has  to  do  with  my   experience  of  you.  When  I'm  looking  at   you  right  now,  you  may  assume  that   what  I  see  is  material.  But  that's  not  what   I  see.  And  it's  not  what  I  believe.     The  way  that  I  understand  it  is  religion  is   an  orientation  and  a  system  of  patterns   and  behaviours  that  allow  you  to  live  in   the  presence  of  and  with  the   consciousness  of  god   my  understanding  of  religions  is  that   they  go  through  a  spiritual  evolution   I  think  that  that  is  a  measure  of  the   largeness  of  the  man's  soul.   we  use  very  elementary  images  to   explain  something  that  is  infinitely   greater  than  ourselves   the  beginning  of  wisdom  is  the   assumption  and  the  belief  that  it  could  be   possible  that  things  exist  in  this  world   which  human  beings  cannot  measure,  for   which  they  do  not  have  access,  except  by   something  that  is  transcendent  inside  of   us.   So,  I  would  say  that  if  you're  going  to  try   in  this  world  to  make  a  decent  world  that   historically  speaking,  although  I  won't   speak  for  the  future,  you  are  much  better   off  training  people  to  believe  that  they   are  not  the  most  powerful,  most   knowledgeable,  most  decisively  able  to   come  to  conclusions  about  the  world   creation,  but  that  in  fact  a  certain  amount   of  humility  both  about  what  they  know   and  what  they  do  is  appropriate  and  that   humility  comes  from  ­   South  Korea  is  Christian.  North  Korea  is   communist.     but  the  values  that  you  take  with   skeptical  inquiry  are  values  that  in  fact   were  taken  from  the  religious  regimes   that  you  find  unpalatable,  and  were   rejected  by  all  these  regimes  that  were   genocidal   Because,  even  though  you  can  cherry   pick  lines  that  are  both  funny  and   destructive,  the  truth  is  that  every   tradition  is  not  made  just  of  propositions,   it's  something  that's  lived,  and  bred  in   you,  and  if  it  works  well,  produces   magnificent  human  beings.     That's  right.  But  that's  not  a  bad  thing.   First  of  all,  ask  yourself  this:  "Even   despite  her  doubts,  if  Mother  Teresa   weren't  a  devout  Christian,  do  you  think   that  she  would've  spent  her  life  among   the  lepurs  of  Calcutta?"     religious  people  are  psychologically

An  appeal  to  the  value  ­  and   drawbacks  ­  of  holy  texts.  This   rhetorical  strategy  refers  to  both   the  literal  value  and  the  interpretive   value  of  scripture,  often  citing  the   ability  of  religious  communities  to   continually  reinterpret  scriptural   meaning.  Stylistic  features  include   directly  referencing  passages  and   authors,  as  well  as  the  use  of  the   following  terms:  explicit   propositions;  claims;  literature;   interpretive;  nourishment;  static;   biblical  claim;  bible;  holy  book;   religious  text;  story;  Leviticus;   Deuteronomy;  Abraham.

fact;  authenticate;  reasonableness;   argument;  common  sense;  false   analogy;  true;  understand;   postulate;  standard  (Tietge,  2008).              just  the  intuitions  of  arithmetic.  You   explain  the  process  of  expenentiation  to   somebody,  how  if  you  fold  the  piece  of   paper  100  times  is  to  essentially  multiply   it's  thickness  by  2  rays  to  the  power  of   100,  and  then  you  see  that  the  numbers   get  very  big.  Now  this  is  not,  this  is   reasoning.  You  don't  get  much  more   rigorous  than  arithmetic  in  terms  of   reasoning,  but  it  is  intuitive  to  the  core   that  the  fact  that  any  of  this  is  intelligible   is  a  matter  of  intuition.     but  no  intuition  you  can  have,  when  you   sit  down  in  prayer  or  in  meditation  is   going  to  authenticate  most  of  what   religious  people  believe  most  of  the  time   in  the  service  of  their  religions  like  the   virgin  birth  of  Jesus.   And  so  this  notion  that  Stalin  and  Hitler   and  Pul  Pot  were  doing  what  they  did   because  of  atheism,  but  of  non-belief  in   god;  I  mean  ask  yourself:  "is  too  much   skeptical  inquiry  really  what's  wrong   with  North  Korea?"  The  North  Koreans   are  a  cargo  cult  armed  with  nuclear   weapons  right  now.  They  think  that  the   food  aid  we  give  them  is  a  devotional   offering  to  the  genius  of  their  dear   leader.  They  are  systematically   impoverished,  both  physically  and  in   terms  of  information.  Too  much   knowledge  ...  any  knowledge  is  too  much   knowledge  ..  uh..  in  North  Korea.  This  is   not  a  paradise  of  reasonableness   I  don't  know  how  we're  gonna  get  to  a   future  where  Muslims  believing  in   martyrdom  and  Christians  believing  in   the  rapture,  will  be  a  good  recipe  for   good  neighbours   OK,  you  don't  exist  ...  many  people  claim   to  find  it  impossible  to  believe,  or  to   imagine,  that  they  won't  exist  after  death.   Um,  just  try  it  for  a  second.  Imagine  that   everyone  in  Paris  right  now  is  getting   along  fine  without  all  of  us.  None  of  us   are  in  Paris.  We  are  really,  really   materially  absent  from  whatever  is  going   on  in  every  other  city  on  this  planet  right   now.  You  are  absent  for  all  of  human   history  before  your  birth.  The  idea  that   you  simply  can't  imagine  not  existing   after  death  is  really  kind  of,  for  lack  of   trying   There  are  three  ways  to  defend  religion:   One  is  the  argument  that  religion  is  true,   that  one  specific  religion  is  true  or  that   god  exists  or  that  the  bible  was  really   dictated  by  him.  Another  is  to  argue  that   religion  is  useful.  OK,  and  this  is  the   `religion  is  useful'  argument;  that  religion   is  the  basis  for  morality.  This  is  ­  please   notice  ­  that  this  is  a  very  different  track   to  run  on,  and  it  says  nothing  at  all  about   whether  or  not  god  exists   Even  if  I  conceded  that  religion  is   profoundly  useful.  So  useful  that  it's   indispensible;  you  know,  people  without   religion  would  just  rape  and  kill  each

Broad     Category   1.   `Comparative   or  Attack'   rhetoric   a)  Compatibility   of  religion  and   science           The  positioning  of  science  and   religion  as  compatible  and   complementary.  Stylistic  features  of   this  strategy  include  the  following:   mentioning  of  both  science  and   religion,  use  of  scientific  terms  (ie.   evidence,  claim,  skeptical  inquiry,   constitute),  use  of  examples  of   historical  parallelism,  agreeing  with   points  made  by  opponents,  and  the   use  of  the  following  terms:  `agree',   `compatible',  `synergy',  `friendship,'   `co-exist,'  and  `common.'         · Suddenly  the  Christian  concept  of   eternity,  of  a  god  being  outside  of  space   and  time,  which  for  centuries  was   scientifically  unintelligible  is  now  not   only  coherent,  but  riding  along  side  the   most  cutting-edge  discoveries  in  modern   physics  and  modern  astronomy   .  Now,  these  are  not  scientific  theories.  If   you  talk  to  the  ancient  Hebrews  and  say,   "How  do  you  know  that  there  was   nothing  and  there  was  a  universe?"  They   didn't  do  any  scientific  experiments.   They  basically  said,  "God  told  me."  But   I'm  saying  that  if  you  look  at  that  as  a   prophecy  or  as  a  factual  claim  about  the   world,  we  now  know  2,000  years  later   that  it  is,  in  its  essence,  correct.     I've  argued  that  I  think  Christians  need  to   learn  to  be  bilingual.  And  by  that  I  mean   to  speak,  perhaps,  two  languages:  a   Christian  language  at  home,  or  in  church,   and  a  more  secular  language  in  the   public  square.  Not  because  we  want  to   wear  two  faces,  but  because  we  want  to   make  our  arguments  accessible  to  people   who  may  not  share  our  assumptions   I  think,  in  a  democratic  society  the   common  ground  of  reason  is  a  perfectly   appropriate  language  for  democratic   discourse   So  what  we're  doing  here  is  a  secular,   intellectual  enterprise.     think  it  demonstrates  very  clearly  the   moral  superiority  of  the  secular  concept   of  justice  and  law  over  Canon  Law  and   religious  law,  with  its  sickly  emphasis  on   self-exculpation  in  the  guise  of   forgiveness  and  redemption   Well,  these  are  non-overlapping   magisteria,  the  material  world,  the   scientific  world  and  the  faith  world."  I   think  "non-overlapping"  is  too  soft.  I   think  it's  more  a  question,  increasingly,   of  it  being  a  matter  of  incompatibility,  or   perhaps  better  to  say,  irreconcilability.     It's  instead  a  refusal  of  faith  and  a  refusal   to  use  it  as  a  method  of  reasoning.  So,  it's   not  comparing  like  with  like  at  all.   in  the  world  we're  not  in  a  position   where  there's  only  one  explanation   contending,  there  are  rival  explanations.   There  is  a  theist  explanation  (the  God   explanation)  and  there  is  a  non-theist,  or   atheist  explanation.  We  have  to  weigh   the  two  against  each  other     you  get  it  in  church  or  you  get  it  in   synagogue  or  you  get  it  every  Sunday,   the  argument  from  the  Bible,  the   argument  from  authority.  I  know  it's  a   useless  argument  to  use  in  a  secular   Concept   Definition     Examples

setting  especially  when  debating  with  an   atheist   It  seems  to  me  that  is  the  one  position-- it's  what  I  call  the  faith  position--that   has  to  be  discarded  first   think  it  demonstrates  very  clearly  the   moral  superiority  of  the  secular  concept   of  justice  and  law  over  Canon  Law  and   religious  law,  with  its  sickly  emphasis  on   self-exculpation  in  the  guise  of   forgiveness  and  redemption   That's  not  the  only  reason  why  religion  is   a  problem:  it's  a  problem  principally   because  it  is  man-made.     This  is  not  modesty  or  humility,  it's  a   man-made  false  consolation,  in  my   judgment,  and  it  does  great  moral   damage.  It  warps--it  begins  by  warping   what  we  might  call  our  moral  sense  of   proportion   It  quite  clearly  shows  that  it's  the  first,   the  most  primitive,  the  most  crude,  and   the  most  deluded  attempt  to  make  sense.   It  is  the  worst  attempt,  but  partly   because  it  was  the  first.     the  worst  thing  it  did  for  us  was  to  offer   us  certainty,  to  say,  "These  are  truths   that  are  unalterable;  they're  handed   down  from  on  high;  we  only  have  to   learn  God's  will  and  how  to  obey  it  in   order  to  free  ourselves  from  these   dilemmas."   can  you  be  brought  to  believe  that  the   main  events  in  human  history,  the  crucial   ones,  happened  3,000  to  2,000  years  ago   in  illiterate,  desert  Arabia  and  Palestine?     Now  can  you  think  of  any  religious   spokesman  you've  ever  heard  who   would  tell  you  in  advance  what  would   disprove  their  hypothesis?  Of  course  you   can't,  because  it's  unfalsifiable.   that  unfalsifiability  in  a  theory  is  a  test   not  of  its  strength,  but  of  its  weakness.     And  there's  no  argument  that  I  can  bring   or  that  anyone  can  bring  against  it,  and   that's  what  should  make  you  suspicious.   he  announced,  I  have  his  words,  he  was   going  to  talk  without  reference  to   Revelation,  Scripture,  or  Scriptural   Authority.  Now,  why  ask  yourselves   then--I'll  ask  you,  why  is  that?  Why  do  I   never  come  up  against  someone  who   says,  "I'll  tell  you  why  I'm  religious:   because  I  think  that  Jesus  of  Nazareth  is   the  way,  the  truth,  and  the  life  and  no   one  comes  to  the  Father  except  by  Him   and  if  you'll  believe  on  this  you'll  be   given  eternal  life."     I'd  be  impressed  if  people  would   sometimes  say  that.  Why  do  the  religious   people  so  often  feel  they  must  say,  "No   we  don't--well  that's  all  sort  of   metaphorical."  In  what  sense  are  they   then  religious?     That  cannot  be  disproved,  it  can  only  be   argued  that  there's  no  evidence  for  it.     But  the  deist,  having  established  that   position,  if  they  have,  has  all  their  work  

  

c)  Critique  of   religion  and/or   faith  

The  positioning  of  religion  and/or   faith  as  illogical,  inconsistent,   limited  or  flawed.  This  rhetorical   strategy  tends  to  point  out  the   unfalsifiability  of  religion  and/or   faith,  the  tendency  of  religion  to   reject  or  adopt  science  when   convenient,  and  the  tendency  of   religions  to  make  supernatural   claims  on  insufficient  evidence.   Stylistic  features  include  the  use  of   the  following  terms:  falsifiable;   superstition;  dogmatism;  false;   claim;  standards  of  rationality;   incompatible;  arrogance;  naïve;   immune  to  criticism;  problem;   appalling.

still  ahead  of  them  to  show  there  is  a  god   who  cares  about  us,  even  knows  we  exist,   takes  sides  in  our  little  tribal  wars,  cares   who  we  sleep  with  and  in  what  position,   cares  what  we  eat  and  on  what  day  of  the   week,  arbitrates  matters  of  this  kind   .  I  don't  think  it's  absolutely  certainly   established  there  is  such  a  person  or  that   He  made  those  pronouncements  or  that   He  was  the  son  of  God  or  the  son  of  a   virgin  or  any  of  these  things   it  can't  be  demonstrated  to  me  that   Socrates  ever  walked  the  streets  of   Athens.   not  all  these  religions  can  be   simultaneously  true.   there  are  enormous  numbers  of   competing  religions,  it's  another  reason   that  it's  obvious  to  me  that  they're  man- made   Either  one  of  them  is  completely  true,  as   the  Roman  Church  used  to  say,  it  was  the   one  true  church,  some  of  its  members   still  do,  or  all  of  them  are  false,  or  all  of   them  are  true,  which,  of  course,  can't  be   true   Really  there  was  nothing  and  the   Hebrews  were  so  clever  that  they  knew   that  and  therefore  they  must  have  been   right  about  God  as  well."  This  is   ridiculous.  The  ancient  Hebrews  also   thought  that  God  made  man  and  women   out  of  nothing,  or  out  of  dust  and  clay,   whereas  we  have  an  exact  knowledge,  or   an  increasingly  exact  knowledge  of   precisely  the  genetic  materials  in   common  with  other  creatures  from   which  we  were  assembled   I  don't  think  it's  wise  or  moral  or  decent   to  try  and  detect  the  finger  of  God  in   human  quarrels.  I  think  the  enterprise  is   futile  and  it  incidentally  shows  the   absurdity  of  all  arguments  from  design.     My  admitting  that  I  don't  know  exactly   how  it  began  is  not  at  all  the  same  as   Dinesh's  admission  that  he  doesn't  know   either  because  he  feels  he  has  to  know,   because  if  it's  not  a  matter  of  faith  and   not  a  matter  of  God  he  can't  say  he   believes  in  it  a  little  bit,  it  must  be  a  real   belief  to  be  genuine,  and  it  must  have   some  explanatory  value.  And  he  doesn't   hold  it  very  strongly  and  it  doesn't   explain  anything  for  which  we  have   better  explanations   Likewise  about  where  we're  going:  we   have  a  very  good  idea  now  of  the  time   and  the  place,  if  you  like--the  time   anyway  when  our  universe  and  sun  and   indeed  the  cosmos  will  come  to  an  end.   Dinesh  might  say,  "Well  then  if  you  look   at  the  Bible  it  proves  right  all  those  who   said  the  end  of  the  world  is  at  hand.   There's  biblical  authority,  it  just  proves   me  right  all  along."  Yes,  except  that  they   said  that  by  repenting  you  could  prevent   this  outcome,  which  you  cannot   You  can't  know  that  and  you  shouldn't

say  it   take  nothing  for  certain,  don't  believe  in   any  absolutism,  don't  believe  in  any   totalitarianism,  don't  ask  for  any   supreme  leader  in  the  sky,  or  on  earth  for   that  way  lies  madness  and  torture  and   murder  and  always  will.   Because  religion  is  man-made   a  faith-based  position  which  has  no   evidence   actually  what  many  people  mean  is  hell   is  for  other  people  and  they  have  just  a   strong  a  wish  thought  that  other  people   suffer  eternally  as  they  have  the  thought   and  the  wish  for  themselves  that  they   should  be  in  paradise   But  of  course  evolution  does  not  explain   the  presence  of  life  on  the  planet.  Darwin   knew  that.  Evolution  merely  explains  the   transition  between  one  life  form  and   another.     Why  should  the  universe  be  structured   in  precisely  this  way  and  no  other  way?   What  is  the  best  explanation?  Is  there  an   atheist  explanation?  I'd  like  to  hear  it   So  how  do  you  explain  this  human  evil   that  far  outruns  necessity  and  reaches   depths  that  seem  almost  unfathomable?   Evolution  cannot  account  for  rationality   because  evolution  says  we  are   programmed  in  the  world  to  survive  and   reproduce.  Our  minds  are  organs  of   survival.  They  are  not  organs  of  truth.  So   if  we  believe  in  rationality  we  require   something  outside  of  evolution  to   account  for  that.     My  contention  is  that  the  atheist   explanation  flounders  when  confronted   with  all  these  facts:  the  complexity  of  the   cell,  the  fine-tuning  of  the  universe,  the   fact  of  morality,  the  depth  of  human  evil,   the  reality  of  morality  in  the  world   What's  the  purpose  of  our  life?"  or  "Why   are  we  here?"  or  "Where  are  we  going?   What  happens  to  us  after  we  die?"  Here   are  the  scientific  answers  to  those  three   questions:  "Don't  have  a  clue,"  "Don't   have  a  clue,"  and  "Don't  have  a  clue."     let's  remember  that  the  atheist  premise   is  that  we  are  evolved  creatures  in  the   world  and  that's  it.  So  evolution  has  to  do   a  lot  of  work.  It  has  to  explain  the  human   desire  to  give  blood  to  strangers.  If  it   can't  do  that,  then  it  fails  as  an  adequate   explanation  for  a  very  important  form  of   human  behavior,  morality,  that  is  seen  in   every  culture  known  to  man.  It  requires   explanation   And  it's  in  me  but  it's  not  of  me.  In  fact,   it's  often  stopping  me  from  doing  what  I   want  to  do.  It's  blocking  my  self-interest.   Where  does  that  come  from?  How  does   evolution  account  for  that?     The  problem  with  that  is,  you  can  call  it   not  only  a  scandalous  violation  of   Ockham's  razor,  it's  essentially  syllogistic   promiscuity   Imagine  if  I  were  to  try  to  show  the

A  type  of  argument  based  on   personal  experiences  of  the  divine,   references  to  the  metaphysical   qualities  of  life,  and  broad,   interpretive  statements,  usually  not   susceptible  to  scientific  scrutiny  or   based  on  empirical  evidence.   Stylistic  features  include  the  use  of   the  following  terms:  presence  of   god;  eternal;  not  physical;  not  of  the   world;  invisible  order;   transcendent;  intangible  creator;   consciousness;  spiritual  evolution;   soul;  I  see;  I  believe  (Wuthnow,   1988).     The  positioning  of  religion  as  a   contributor  to  social  progress,   moral  enlightenment,  and  goodwill.   Stylistic  features  of  this  rhetorical   strategy  include  referencing  the   values  that  societies  derive  from   religion,  and  the  use  of  the   following  terms:  decent  world;   creation;  humility;  lived;  happier;   values;  not  the  problem;  answer;   love;  forgiveness;  family;  lower   anxiety;  profounder  understanding   of  life.

An  appeal  to  the  value  ­  and   drawbacks  ­  of  holy  texts.  This   rhetorical  strategy  refers  to  both   the  literal  value  and  the  interpretive   value  of  scripture,  often  citing  the   ability  of  religious  communities  to   continually  reinterpret  scriptural   meaning.  Stylistic  features  include   directly  referencing  passages  and   authors,  as  well  as  the  use  of  the

· if  you  can  explain  these  facts  better  than   I  can,  I  will  happily,  as  a  skeptic,  concede   to  your  point  of  view.  GIve  me  a  better   explanation  for  these  facts.     What  could  be  more  appropriate  than  to   address  these  arguments  in  the   vocabulary  of  reason?    we  are  at  a  state   of  cultue  in  which  we  have  to  use   rational  arguments  if  we  are  trying  to   communicate  in  secular  venues   So,  my  point  is  let's  supply  the   reasonable  standard.  If  we  see  a  fine- tuned  universe,  what's  more  likely,   someone  fine-tuned  it,  or  it  fine-tuned   itself?  Could  the  universe  have  created   itself  out  of  nothing?  Is  there  some   alternative  explanation  for  the  data  at   hand?  No.  So  I'm  simply  saying  let's  go   with  the  best  explanation.     A  final  point  about  this  is  that  we're   committing  here  what  could  be  called  a   genetic  fallacy.  We  do  it  with  religion,  we   can  always  can  see  the  fallacy  if  we  apply   it  to  any  other  area.  For  example,  it  is   very  probable  there  are  more  people   who  believe  in  Darwin's  theory  of   evolution  who  come  from  Oxford,   England  than  who  come  from  Oxford,   Mississippi.  It's  probably  equally  true   that  there  are  more  people  who  believe   in  Einstein's  theory  of  relativity  who   come  from  New  York  than  who  come   from  New  Guinea.  What  does  this  say   about  whether  Einstein's  theory  is   correct  or  no?  Nothing.  The  origins  of   your  ideas  have  no  bearing  on  whether   they're  true  or  not   I  think,  in  a  democratic  society  the   common  ground  of  reason  is  a  perfectly   appropriate  language  for  democratic   discourse   So  what  we're  doing  here  is  a  secular,   intellectual  enterprise.     So,  the  point  I'm  simply  saying  is  that   based  on  current  knowledge--and  all   arguments  have  to  be  based  on  what  we   know  now.  We're  all  open  to  new  ideas   in  the  future.  There  is  currently  no  good   explanation.     if  I  was  walking  down  and  I  looked  in  an   alley  and  I  see  a  head  rolling  around,  I   conclude  that  somebody  committed   suicide  or  somebody  killed  someone.  It's   a  reasonable  inference  from  the  data.   You  could  say,  "Well,  that's  a  rather   presumptuous  conclusion.  There  might   have  been  natural  ways  in  which  the   head  detached  itself  from  ...  there  could   be,  but  what's  the  most  plausible  under   the  circumstances?     So  if  nature  is  an  embodiment,  a  network   of  intelligent  systems,  isn't  the  most   reasonable  explanation  that  intelligence   put  it  there?  If  we  need  intelligence  to  get   it  out,  how'd  it  get  there  in  the  first   place?     Imagine  if  I  were  to  try  to  show  the   following:  money  comes  out  of  nothing.

Rwanda?  Why  do  care  about  my  Iranian   friends  fighting  theocracy?  Why  do  I  give   up  my  own  time  to  them?  Well  I'll  tell   you  why,  and  I  say  it,  I  suppose,  at  the   risk  of  embarrassment:  it  gives  me  great   pleasure  to  do  so.     So  my  closing  recommendation  is:  why   not  try  the  stoical  and  Socratic  life  for   yourself?  Why  not  examine  more  close   the  tradition,  the  great  tradition  that  we   have,  from  Lucretius  and  Democritus   that  goes  through  Galileo,  Spinoza,   Voltaire,  Einstein,  Russell,  and  many   others.  A  tradition,  I  think,  much  greater   than  the  fearful  and  the  propitiatory  and   the  ritualistic.     So  here  we  are  at  a  university   wherever  Christopher  and  I  got  our   ideologies  or  our  religious  convictions,   you  should  weigh  our  arguments  on  the   merits.   there  are  enormous  numbers  of   competing  religions,  it's  another  reason   that  it's  obvious  to  me  that  they're  man- made   So  how  did  we  get  a  cell?  The  very  idea   that  random  molecules  in  a  warm  pond   through  a  bolt  of  lightning  assembled  a   cell  would  be  akin  to  saying  a  bolt  of   lightning  in  a  warm  pond  could  assemble   an  automobile  or  a  skyscraper.  It's   preposterous.     What  about  the  God  explanation?  Seems   obvious  to  me  it  does  one  heck  of  a  lot   better.  Why  do  we  have  a  cell  that  shows   the  structure  of  complexity?  Because  the   cell  has  been  intelligently  designed   perhaps  by  an  intelligent  designer.  Why   does  the  universe  show  complexity  and   rationality?  Well,  those  are  the   characteristics  of  the  creator  who  made   it  that  way.  Why  are  there  depths  of   human  evil?  Because  our  lives  are  a   cosmic  drama  in  which  good  and  evil  are   in  constant  struggle  (the  Christian  story).   Why  is  there  morality  in  the  world?  Why   do  we  all  feel,  even  when  it  works   against  our  advantage,  a  moral  law   within  us?  Well  that's  because  there  is  a   moral  lawgiver  who  gave  it  to  us.  So   when  we  put  it  all  together,  the   presupposition  of  God--God  is  invisible,   I  concede  that,  we  can't  see  Him.  But  if   we  posit  Him,  all  these  mysterious   facts--suddenly  the  lights  come  on.  It   provides  an  explanation   So,  my  point  is  let's  supply  the   reasonable  standard.  If  we  see  a  fine- tuned  universe,  what's  more  likely,   someone  fine-tuned  it,  or  it  fine-tuned   itself?  Could  the  universe  have  created   itself  out  of  nothing?  Is  there  some   alternative  explanation  for  the  data  at   hand?  No.  So  I'm  simply  saying  let's  go   with  the  best  explanation.     So  I'm  saying  that  the  God  hypothesis   casts  more  light  on  that  subject,  the   hypothesis  of  a  moral  lawgiver.  In  fact,

b)  Enthymeme  

An  appeal  to  what  the  audience   already  partially  believes  to  be  true.   This  rhetorical  strategy  uses   deductive  arguments  with  unstated   assumptions  that  must  be  true  for   the  premises  to  lead  to  the   conclusion  (Gitay,  2009;  Craig  &   Muller,  2007).  It  also  relies  on   justifiable  opinion  rather  than   empirically  sound  claims.  Stylistic   features  include  posing  questions  to   the  audience  and  framing   statements  as  though  they  are   truths.

Evoking  feelings  of  credibility   within  an  argument  by  referencing   other  people;  including  scientific   experts,  religious  figures,  historical   figures,  scholars,  and  philosophers   (Tietge,  2008).  This  rhetorical   strategy  sometimes  includes  a   quotation  from  the  author,  or  a   paraphrased  passage  from  their   body  of  work.
