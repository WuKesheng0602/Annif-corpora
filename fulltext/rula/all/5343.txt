ABSTRACT      In  this  major  research  paper  (MRP),  I  analyzed  the  ways  in  which  rhetorical  

strategies  are  used  in  the  construction  of  corporate  public  apologies.     Organizational   reputation   management   has   become   increasingly   important   in   the   digital   age.   When   companies   are   criticized   or   accused   of   wrongdoing,   it   is   essential   to   issue   a   timely   and   effective   response   to   salvage   stakeholder   relationships.     Speaking   from   the   Rhetorical   Tradition,   Aristotle   demonstrated   that   the   art   of   persuasion   is   largely   built   upon   three   rhetorical   appeals:   the   appeal   to   pathos   (emotion),   ethos   (character),   and   logos   (logic).   Through   methods   of   coding   and   rhetorical  analyses,  I  examined  7  corporate  public  apologies  released  by  high  profile   companies  between  2008  and  2012.  I  found  that  corporate  public  apologies  tend  to   appeal   to   ethos   more   than   any   other   means   of   persuasion.   Reflecting   good   organizational  character  is  therefore,  germane  to  organizations  in  crisis.  Employed   the  least  was  the  appeal  to  logos,  or  logic.  I  found  that  this  rhetorical  strategy  was   used  primarily  to  strengthen  other  persuasive  appeals  such  as  appeals  to  emotion  or   character.  Logos,  used  in  isolation,  was  rare  and  arguably  ineffective.   It  is  in  my  opinion  that  the  focus  on  rhetorical  strategies  is  lacking  in  public   relations  literature.  To  conclude,  I  made  several  recommendations  to  organizations   responding  to  criticisms  or  accusations  of  misconduct.  These  recommendations  are   to  be  taken  with  the  understanding  that  their  effectiveness  was  not  considered  for   this  project.      iii

Introduction  
   As  corporations  enter  the  digital  age,  organizational  reputation  management   has  become  increasingly  important.  With  the  overarching  goal  of  repairing  a   damaged  reputation,  organizations  must  issue  public  apologies  that  are  capable  of   persuading  stakeholders  to  reinstate  their  trust  in  them.  Persuasion,  then,  becomes   a  key  aspect  of  delivering  a  successful  public  apology.  In  this  Major  Research  Paper   (MRP),  I  will  be  exploring  the  ways  in  which  strategies  of  persuasion  (known  as   rhetoric)  are  used  in  the  construction  of  corporate  public  apologies.  Such  persuasive   tactics  date  back  at  least  to  ancient  Greek  society,  when  Aristotle  argued  that  in   order  to  deliver  an  influential  speech,  one  must  be  able  to  appeal  to  the  public's   emotions  (pathos),  logic  (logo),  and  sense  of  good  character  (ethos).  When  executed   strategically,  these  means  of  persuasion  can  help  the  speaker  communicate  a   message  in  a  manner  that  is  persuasive  and  favourable  to  the  audience.  The  ways  in   which  these  appeals  are  employed  can  ultimately  shed  light  on  how  corporate   public  apologies  are  constructed.     Therefore,  it  is  through  the  guiding  principles  of  the  rhetorical  tradition  that  I   will  be  deconstructing  7  corporate  public  apologies  released  between  2008  and   2012.  My  analysis  will  be  guided  by  the  following  research  questions:  
RQ  1:  Which  rhetorical  appeals  are  used  in  the  construction  of  corporate  public  apologies?     RQ  2:  Which  of  these  strategies  is  most  commonly  used?     RQ  3:  Which  of  these  strategies  is  least  used?     RQ  4:  How  are  these  strategies  employed  through  the  use  of  language?     

  

1  

With  these  questions  in  mind,  I  hope  to  highlight  the  importance  of  rhetorical   appeals  in  the  construction  of  corporate  public  apologies  since  Aristotlelian  rhetoric   is  insufficiently  acknowledged  in  public  relations  literature  (Skerlep,  2001,  p.  177).   As  the  art  of  persuasion,  rhetoric  can  help  make  an  apology  more  effective.  This  is   important  since  businesses,  confronted  with  allegations  of  wrongdoing,  are  facing   social  legitimacy  crises  and  are  rapidly  losing  public  trust  (Ide  &  Yarn,  2003,  p.   1114).  This  loss  of  trust  creates  a  hurdle  for  organizations  that  wish  to  communicate   a  `true  apology',  one  that  favours  public  reconciliation  over  commercial  interests.   Tom  McNiff  (2009)  describes  the  appearance  of  such  an  apology:  
First,  you  have  to  actually  be  sorry.  Then,  you  have  to  admit  fully,  without   rationalizations  or  excuses,  that  what  you  did  was  wrong.  If  possible,  you  should   make  restitution  to  those  you  have  offended.  Finally,  your  outward  behavior  should   reflect  the  inner  change  of  heart  and  mind.    

   A  successful  apology  is  therefore  one  that  manages  to  persuade,  but  at  the  same   time  appears  genuine.  My  hope  is  that  the  findings  that  stem  from  this  research  may   help  public  relations  professionals  understand  the  function  of  rhetorical  appeals   and  provide  practical  models  of  application.   In  an  era  where  information  is  demanded,  accessed  and  shared   instantaneously,  CEOs  are  coming  to  realize  that  managing  a  company  crisis   requires  a  new  level  of  strategy  if  they  wish  to  reach  their  publics.  Kevin  Read   (2007)  asserts  that  
...with  the  advent  of  new  media,  in  particular,  web  2.0  techniques,  new  types  of   threats  have  emerged  that  are  more  difficult  to  assess.  In  part,  with  the  new  media   revolution,  in  particular  blogs,  forums  and  chat  rooms  a  new  generation  of   individuals  are  merging  who  can  stir  up  hostile  opinion,  quickly  and  virulently  in  an   unaccountable  manner.  (p.  336)

Here,  Read  depicts  an  emerging  generation  of  individuals  who  are  equipped  with  a   range  of  digital  weaponry,  capable  of  damaging  an  organization's  reputation  almost   instantly.  Due  to  this  rapid  spread  and  exchange  of  public  opinion,  it  is  a   corporation's  main  agenda  to  respond  to  criticisms  in  a  timely  and  appropriate   manner  (Chung,  2011,  p.  5).  With  the  new  media  revolution,  it  is  clear  that  quelling   hostile  public  opinion  can  become  a  grueling  task  for  public  relations  professionals   (Read,  2007  p.337).            Effective  organizational  responses  to  public  criticism  are  therefore  crucial  if  

stakeholder  relationships  are  to  be  salvaged.  Restoring  trust  after  an  incident  of   misconduct  can  be  highly  challenging.  Whether  they  are  criticized  for  a  product   recall,  an  accident,  or  a  criminal  offence,  organizations  will  be  judged  based  on  their   responses.      Public  apologies  are  the  most  common  and  anticipated  form  of  

organizational  responses  to  charges  of  wrongdoing.  Whether  the  offence  was   committed  intentionally  or  not  and  whether  the  organization  had  any  control  over   the  situation  are  irrelevant.  Organizations  must  successfully  communicate  to  their   audiences  in  order  to  maintain  a  positive  image,  which  Keith  Michael  Hearit  (2006)   argues  should  be  a  company's  "currency,  their  stock  in  trade"  (p.  11).  Restoring  trust   after  being  falsely  or  rightfully  charged  is  the  primary  purpose  of  a  corporate  public   apology.  Tom  McNiff  (2009)  argues  that  Americans  are  quick  to  "condemn   behaviour  that  violate  our  laws  and  offends  our  sensibilities.  Yet,  [they]  are  willing  ­   even  eager  ­  to...embrace  transgressors  when  they  show  true  remorse".    Due  to  the  

  

3  

forgiving  nature  of  American  society  (McNiff,  2009),  public  apologies  have  become  a   critical  aspect  of  an  organization's  crisis  management  effort.  To  better  understand   the  role  of  apology  in  a  corporate  context,  one  must  first  be  acquainted  with  the   historical  transitions  that  led  up  to  the  phenomenon.          In  the  following  chapter,  I  will  be  tracing  back  the  history  of  apology  from  the  

Classical  Ages  to  the  Modern  Era,  touching  upon  the  emergence  of  public  apologies   and  the  factors  that  contributed  to  its  corporate  evolution.  I  will  then  present  a   literature  review  of  the  theoretical  orientations  that  serve  as  the  foundation  of  this   paper.  

The  History  of  Apology  
          Although  the  understanding  of  apology  has  evolved  drastically  over  time,  

the  practice  of  apologizing  has  always  been  highly  rhetorical.  Historically,  apologies   were  used  to  serve  very  different  ends  in  the  Classical  period,  the  Middle  Ages  and   the  Modern  era.  This  transformation  marks  not  only  the  evolution  of  the  apology's   conceptual  nature,  but  more  importantly,  its  rhetorical  makeup.     The  Classical  Period      The  modern  understanding  of  apology  involves  a  systematic  discourse  of  

reconciliation  and  can  be  described  as  the  acknowledgment  and  expression  of  regret   for  fault  or  wrongdoing  without  defense  (Hearit,  2006,  p.  4).  In  antiquity,  apologies   were  nothing  of  the  sort.  They  were  configured  as  responsive  statements  and   described  strictly  as  defensive  speech  against  charges  of  wrongdoing  (Ellwanger,   4  

  

2000,  p.  31).  The  defensive  apology,  or  apologia,  was  found  most  prominently  in   institutional  discourse,  such  as  courts  and  state  assemblies  in  ancient  society   (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  31).  What  is  important  to  note  here  is  that  citizens  were  rarely   summoned  to  offer  such  apologies.  Only  those  who  were  accused  of  committing   crimes  or  who  worked  within  the  forensic  profession  were  required  to  concern   themselves  with  the  delivery  of  apologetic  speech  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  31).  Thus,  the   practice  of  apology  in  the  Classical  period  was  rooted  in  institutional  contexts  and   used  most  commonly  as  a  means  to  defend  one's  character.   The  Middle  Ages   During  the  Middle  Ages,  the  line  of  separation  between  matters  of  state  and   religion  began  to  blur  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  32).  This  overlap  sparked  radical  changes   in  apologetic  practices,  which  would  eventually  lead  to  a  new  understanding  of   apology  familiar  to  modern  society  today  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  32).  Since  antiquity,   defensive  apologetic  discourse  was  used  in  matters  of  state,  however,  with  the   growing  dominance  of  the  Christian  church,  different  practices  were  developed  in   dealing  with  "transgression  and  the  negotiation  of  punishment"  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.   32).  Although  defensive  speech  was  still  largely  a  part  of  apologetic  discourse   throughout  Medieval  society,  the  confessional  rituals  promoted  by  the  Church  led  to   the  merging  of  two  rhetorics  which  had  until  then,  remained  separate:  the  rhetorics   of  defense  and  regret  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  32).  Adam  Ellwanger  (2000)  explains  that,   "this  intermingling  of  apology  and  confession  laid  the  seeds  for  the  remorseful   apology  that  would  emerge  in  the  Modern  era"  (p.  32).  As  such,  the  Middle  Ages  

  

5  

introduced  the  element  of  confession  to  the  ancient  apology  of  defense.  This  shift  in   apologetic  discourse  continued  to  evolve  as  it  entered  the  early  days  of  the   Reformation.   The  Modern  Era      During  the  Modern  era,  Protestant  christians  began  to  distance  themselves  

from  seeking  forgiveness  through  confessional  practices  mediated  by  Catholic   church  authorities.  Instead,  for  the  first  time  in  Christian  history,  "the  repenting  of   personal  sins  could  be  truly  private"  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  32)  and  forgiveness  was   sought  through  personal  prayer.    The  key  difference  between  these  two  practices  of   confession  is  that  Catholicism  produced  sinners  who  were  obligated  to  confess,   whereas  Protestants  believed  in  a  voluntary  and  remorseful  apology.  It  was  the   progressive  secularization  of  Western  society  after  the  Reformation  that  led  to  "a   renewed  divorce  between  practices  of  defense  and  the  formal  expression  of  regret"   (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  33).  This  concept  of  the  remorseful  apology  is  what   contemporary  society  today  agrees  upon  as  the  appropriate  way  to  reconcile   relationships  and  accusations  of  wrongdoing  since  traditional  defensive  apologies   focus  primarily  on  restoring  image  and  are  `unapologetic'  in  nature  (Ellwanger,   2000,  p.  36).  Put  to  secular  ends,  the  modern  apology  is  a  way  for  individuals  to   acknowledge  fault,  and  more  importantly,  to  express  genuine  regret.     Today,  apology  and  forgiveness  are  "inescapable  moral  negotiations"  that  are   socially  expected  if  transgressors  wish  to  repair  a  damaged  reputation  and  mend   broken  relationships  (Waldschlagel,  2011,  p.  iii).  Whether  the  fault  falls  upon  an   6  

  

individual  or  an  organization,  apologies  are  necessary  to  achieve  any  level  of   reconciliation.  As  modern  society  continues  to  navigate  through  the  digital  age,   apologies  that  were  once  considered  private  are  now  becoming  public.  The  rise  of   the  public  apology  suggests  significant  changes  in  societal  values  and  behaviours,   and  an  exploration  of  these  changes  may  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  public   apologies  and  their  rhetorical  blueprint.  What  follows  is  an  overview  of  the  social   changes  that  led  up  to  the  rise  of  public  apologies,  which  eventually  paved  the  way   for  the  emergence  of  corporate  apologetic  discourse.   The  Rise  of  the  Public  Apology      The  public  apology  differs  radically  from  the  private  expression  of  remorse.  

Private  apologies  are  usually  self-motivated  responses,  whereas  public  apologies,   although  perceived  as  voluntary  offerings,  could  be  arguably  described  as  responses   to  offenses  circulating  in  the  mass  media.        The  rise  of  the  public  apology  can  be  largely  credited  to  the  birth  of  the  

public  sphere,  a  term  coined  by  Jurgen  Habermas  to  describe  the  space  where   private  citizens  would  come  together  as  a  public,  and  through  reason,  discuss  issues   of  collective  concern  (Habermas,  1991,  p.  27).  This  allowed  citizens  to  become  more   instrumental  in  the  formation  of  public  opinion,  however,  it  also  led  to  an   unprecedented  form  of  government:  citizens  were  bound  to  a  new  standard  code  of   ethics  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  56)  and  those  who  violated  such  principles  of  ethical   behaviour  were  held  socially  accountable  to  one  another.  In  other  words,  a   violator's  relationship  with  his  or  her  community  was  suspended  until  an  apology   7  

  

was  issued,  symbolizing  the  admittance  of  wrongdoing.  Receiving  forgiveness  from   the  public  meant  wiping  the  slate  clean  and  acceptance  back  into  society  (Bennett,   2006,  p,  133).        The  prevalence  of  public  apologies  can  also  be  attributed  to  the  Western  

fascination  with  collective  guilt,  confession,  and  forgiveness  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  64).   The  rise  of  the  public  sphere  empowered  citizens  and  gave  new  emphasis  to  both   human  and  civil  rights;  this  ultimately  led  to  Western  society's  obsession  with   ritualized  regret  (Ellwanger,  2000,  p.  64)  as  a  form  of  social  punishment.    Ellwanger   (2000)  explains,  
Medieval  confession  demanded  a  diminution  of  the  self  that  is  retained  in  the   apology  of  regret.  It  is  this  peculiar  brand  of  belittlement  that  makes  public  apology   an  effective  means  to  punish  minor  offenses  in  the  public  sphere.  Private  persons   are  rarely  called  upon  to  offer  public  apologies,  mainly  because  their  actions  are  of   very  little  interest  to  the  mass  media  or  its  consumers.  Those  whom  we  extract   public  apologies  are  typically  people  who  live  in  the  public  eye  and  who  enjoy  an   unusual  degree  of  power.  (p.  64)        

Inarguably,  the  advent  of  the  public  sphere  influenced  the  rise  of  the  public  apology   in  modern  society.  Citizens  were  able  to  come  together  and  act  as  arbiters  of  ethical   behaviour,  scorning  those  who  failed  to  comply.  The  public  sphere  ultimately   transformed  the  act  of  apology  from  a  private  transaction  between  individuals  to  a   public  practice  of  reconciliation  with  one's  community.  As  the  domestication  of  the   public  sphere  progressed,  public  apologetic  discourse  continued  to  evolve.  Due  to   recent  changes  in  society,  a  new  genre  of  public  apology  began  to  emerge,  one  that   was  highly  organizational  in  nature  and  the  subject  of  this  research  paper:  the   corporate  public  apology.

The  Emergence  of  Corporate  Apologetic  Discourse      The  public  apology  phenomenon,  now  better  understood  after  dissecting  its  

history,  has  also  infiltrated  the  corporate  arena.  Keith  Michael  Hearit  (2006)  argues   that  American  culture  has  recently  entered  the  organizational  age.  As  Western   society  transitioned  from  an  individual-based  to  an  organizational-based  society,   the  discourse  too  has  evolved  from  "an  individual-driven  rhetoric  to  a  corporate   form  of  discourse"  (p.  121).  The  identities  of  individuals  are  now  an  amalgamation   of  the  brands  they  purchase,  the  companies  they  represent,  and  the  organizations   they  support  since  "Western  culture  has  created  an  eponymous  society,  one  in   which  social  identity  is  composed  of  the  many  organizations  to  which  its  residents   belong"  (Hearit,  2006,  p.  8).  This  new  society  is  marked  by  the  emergence  of  modern   organizations  as  social  actors.  For  Hearit  (2006),  
On  a  de  facto,  day-to-day  level,  society  tends  to  treat  corporations  as  individuals,   and  although  they  are  recognized  to  consist  of  large  numbers  of  people,  their  acts   nonetheless  are  viewed  to  have  a  singular  quality  to  them.  (p.  9)  

What  is  emphasized  here  is  that  organizations  today  have  an  identifiable  image  that   should  be  maintained  and  a  reputation  that  must  be  managed.  Their  social  personae   are  their  currency  and  any  damage  to  it  will  have  tangible  consequences  on  the   organization's  success  (Hearit,  2006,  p.  11).   The  concept  of  public  apologia  was  first  associated  with  individuals  such  as   professional  athletes,  religious  leaders,  and  politicians  accused  of  wrongdoing   (Hearit,  2006,  p.  13).  More  recently,  however,  organizations  (whether  they  be  non- profits  or  corporate  giants)  have  become  the  primary  sources  of  public  apologies   9  

  

(Hearit,  2006,  p.  13).  The  rise  of  corporate  apologetic  discourse  is  a  phenomenon   that  can  be  explained  by  a  number  of  factors.  In  the  following  section,  I  will  be   discussing  a  number  of  considerations  that,  together,  created  the  perfect  climate  for   the  development  of  corporate  public  apologies.           Social  Movements      The  first  factor  that  gave  rise  to  corporate  apologia  was  the  triumph  of  

various  social  movements  in  the  1960s  (the  consumer,  ecology,  civil,  and  women's   rights  movements,  to  name  a  few).  These  movements  brought  society  into  an  era  of   growing  mistrust  of  institutions,  and  businesses  were  increasingly  being  challenged   in  areas  of  product  safety,  equal  opportunity  and  environmental  responsibility   (Hearit,  2006,  p.  13).  Public  opinion  concerning  these  matters  is  highly  influential   and  can  have  negative  consequences  on  the  reputation  of  any  organization.  It  was   during  this  time  that  businesses  learned  the  significance  of  responding  to  public   criticism  (Hearit,  2006,  p.  13).   Technology      A  second  factor  to  consider  when  examining  the  rise  of  corporate  apologia  is  

the  advancement  of  communication  technologies.  The  countless  number  of  media   outlets  serving  the  public  today  acts  as  a  vehicle  for  challenging  corporate  decision- making.  With  the  arrival  of  the  digital  age,  the  Internet  allows  citizens  to  share  and   access  information  at  previously  unimaginable  speeds.  This  exchange  can  foster  the   formation  of  influential  public  opinions,  especially  when  corporations  are  being   criticized.  Organizations  must  therefore  release  timely  and  effective  responses  to      10  

criticisms  if  they  wish  to  maintain  a  positive  reputation  and  prevent  further  damage   to  their  corporate  image.     Consumerism   Hearit  (2006)  suggests  that  another  factor  leading  up  to  the  rise  of  the   corporate  public  apology  is  the  triumph  of  consumerism:  
The  consumer  has  become  the  final  arbiter  of  corporate  behaviour,  and   organizations  often  find  that  they  have  no  other  choice  but  to  acquiesce  to  customer   demands...with  customers  as  the  final  judge,  companies  have  found  that  they  have   no  choice  but  to  respond  vigorously  to  customer  complaints  before  they  lose  control   of  an  issue  or  problem.  (p.  14)  

This  description  of  the  modern  day  customer  illustrates  how  a  consumer's   experience  can  easily  determine  the  success  or  failure  of  a  company.  Therefore,  it  is   crucial  for  organizations  to  respond  to  accusations  of  wrongdoing  by  way  of  public   apology  to  satisfy  consumers  and  other  influential  stakeholders.          Having  explored  the  history  of  public  apologies  and  the  factors  that  

contributed  to  its  corporate  evolution,  I  will  now  be  giving  a  theoretical  overview  of   this  study's  foundation.  

Literature  Review:  Theoretical  Overview  
   In  this  section,  a  number  of  theoretical  concepts  vital  to  this  research  will  be  

explored  and  discussed  in  a  way  that  will  allow  for  a  better  understanding  of   rhetoric  in  apology.     

  

11  

Apologia  vs.  Apology   When  analyzing  apologetic  discourse,  the  distinction  between  apologia  and   apology  must  be  made.  Traditional  apologia  was  first  articulated  as  a  genre  of   rhetoric  by  Ware  and  Linkugel  (1973)  and  refers  to  the  self-defense  of  one's   character  using  four  strategies:  denial,  bolstering,  differentiation,  and   transcendence.     Throughout  history,  the  function  of  apologia  has  been  changed  and  refined.   Earlier  theorists  saw  apologia  as  strategies  that  "deny  the  wrongdoing  that  has  been   done  or  that  redefine  or  transcend  that  wrongdoing"  (Koesten  &  Rowland,  2004,  p.   70).  Thus,  while  an  apology  involves  the  admission  of  guilt  and  acceptance  of   responsibility,  apologia  serves  strictly  as  a  strategy  of  self-defense.  Today,  amid  the   proliferation  of  corporate  crises  and  the  importance  of  reputation  management,   responses  to  public  criticisms  are  more  likely  to  abandon  the  defensive  discourse  of   apologia  and  instead  exemplify  an  approach  of  self-disclosure  through  public   apology.     Corporate  Apologia   As  discussed  earlier  in  the  historical  overview,  corporate  apologia  is  an   extension  of  traditional  apologetic  discourse.  Josh  Greenberg  and  Charlene  Elliott   (2009)  argue  that  such  organizational  responses  to  crisis  involve  "the  use  of   apologia  as  a  strategy  for  reputational  defense  in  the  face  of  intense  criticism"  (p.   194).    William  Benoit  (1995),  however,  believes  that  in  addition  to  defensive   strategies,  corporations  should  be  adopting  formal  apologies  (when  appropriate)  to      12  

victims  in  order  to  repair  damaged  reputations  and  relationships  during  times  of   crisis.  This  type  of  formal  apology  represents  a  sub-genre  of  apologia  known  as   corporate  apologia  ­  strategies  employed  by  corporations  to  defend  their   reputations,  which  can  at  times,  include  the  delivery  of  a  public  apology.   For  example,  international  footwear  and  athletic  apparel  company  Nike   employed  corporate  apologia  strategies  without  the  use  of  a  public  apology  during  a   time  when  the  organization  faced  mounting  criticism  of  its  use  of  Asian  sweatshop   labour  (Greenberg  &  Elliott,  2009,  p.  195).  Nike  denied  any  responsibility,  claiming   that  it  had  been  "unfairly  targeted  by  activists  who  had  an  axe  to  grind  and  who   were  relying  on  incomplete  and  inaccurate  information"  (Greenberg  &  Elliott,  2009,   p.195).  The  company  then  tried  shifting  the  blame  by  scapegoating  external  actors   like  sub-contactors  in  developing  countries  (Greenberg  &  Elliott,  2009,  0p.  195).  In   contrast,  Maple  Leaf  Foods  made  use  of  corporate  apologia  strategies,  which   included  the  delivery  of  an  emotional  public  apology.  During  its  Listeriosis  crisis,   company  CEO  Michael  McCain  apologized  to  the  public  and  abandoned  all  defensive   tactics.  As  a  representative  of  the  organization,  McCain  accepted  full  responsibility,   irrespective  of  the  financial  losses  ($25-30  million  and  class  action  lawsuits),  a  bold   act  that  was  necessary  to  regain  the  public's  trust  (Elliott  &  Greenberg,  2009,  p.  195).   McCain's  accountability  was  "embraced  with  pretty  much  universal  praise  by  the   mainstream  media,  PR  industry  observers,  and  within  the  blogosphere"  (Elliott  &   Greenberg,  2009,  p.  196).    The  outcome  of  both  cases  differed,  with  Maple  Leaf   Foods'  approach  being  the  most  fruitful.  This  juxtaposition  favours  public  apologies   as  effective  corporate  apologia  strategies.      13  

Drawing  on  Benoit's  (1995)  image  restoration  theory,  mortification  is   favoured  as  a  way  to  manage  reputation  during  a  corporate  crisis.  Mortification   occurs  when  an  organization  "accepts  responsibility  for  the  action  and  asks   stakeholders  for  forgiveness"  (Coombs,  Frandsen,  Holladay,  &  Johansen,  2004,  240).   It  is  the  element  of  mortification  that  bridges  the  practice  of  apologia,  or  defensive   speech,  to  the  notion  of  apology.  In  other  words,  without  mortification,  an  apology   cannot  exist.      In  essence,  corporate  apologia  involves  rhetorical  strategies  that  help  

organizations  defend  their  reputations.  In  contrast  to  traditional  apologia,  it   involves  the  option  of  delivering  a  formal  public  apology  in  response  to  criticisms  or   accusations  of  misconduct.  As  stated  earlier  in  the  introduction  of  this  paper,  I  will   be  analyzing  the  responses  of  7  organizations  that  chose  to  deliver  public  apologies   in  an  effort  to  salvage  their  image  and  mend  stakeholder  relationships.     Aristotelian  Rhetoric      The  last  component  of  this  theoretical  overview  is  the  concept  of  Aristotelian  

rhetoric.  The  abundance  of  corporate  public  apologies  in  today's  media  landscape   only  puts  more  pressure  on  public  relations  practitioners  and  professional   communicators  to  compose  apology  speeches  that  will  successfully  repair  a   tarnished  image.  In  order  to  be  successful,  public  apologies  must  first  and  foremost   be  able  to  persuade  the  public  to  believe  that  the  company  is  worthy  of  their  trust.     Restoring  public  trust  will  in  turn  reinstate  public  opinion  and  a  positive  brand   persona.  For  Taryn  Fuchs-Burnett  (2002),  consumers  are   14  

  

...Placing  a  high  premium  on  the  so-called  corporate  apology  and  while  the  supply  of   apologies  has  been  abundant  as  of  late,  consumers  are  acting  monopolistically  in   that  they  are  withholding  their  acceptance  until  corporations  are  ready  to  raise  the   level  of  quality  of  the  apology  (p.  31)  

With  this  recent  development  in  public  standards,  the  notion  of  trust  becomes  a   critical  element  in  the  consumer-corporation  relationship.  Companies  who  have   been  publically  criticized  are  therefore  burdened  with  the  grueling  task  of   persuading  stakeholders  that  despite  any  incidents  of  misconduct,  they  are  still   reputable  and  trustworthy  organizations.  Persuasive  speech,  or  what  Aristotle   refers  to  as  rhetoric,  is  therefore  a  major  aspect  of  effective  public  apology  discourse.        For  Skerlep  (2005),  the  practice  of  public  relations  has  shown  very  little  

interest  in  the  art  of  rhetoric  (p.  177).  Aristotlelian  rhetoric  is  an  oral  tradition  that   recognizes  three  modes  of  persuasion,  which  Aristotle  considers  to  be  types  of   argumentation.  The  first  is  ethos,  a  speaker's  ability  to  legitimize  his  or  her  message   by  establishing  a  credible  self-image.  The  second  is  pathos,  a  speaker's  ability  to   influence  the  emotions  of  the  hearers.  The  third,  and  what  Aristotle  believes  to  be   the  most  essential,  is  logos,  a  speaker's  ability  to  demonstrate  logic  on  the  topic  of   the  speech  (Skerlep,  2005,  p.  177).  For  Aristotle,  the  art  of  public  speaking  is   effective  if  the  orator  can  employ  these  three  modes  of  persuasion  ­  they  are  "...the   only  true  constituents  of  the  art:  everything  else  is  merely  accessory"  (Aristotle,   2010,  p.  3).   Delving  deeper  into  this  theoretical  overview,  I  will  now  provide  an  in-depth   description  of  each  rhetorical  appeal  while  highlighting  its  features  in  detail.      15  

  

Pathos      Demonstrating  a  level  of  sincerity  when  publically  expressing  remorse  is  a  

highly  emotional  transaction.  For  Kevin  Read  (2007),  many  PR  practitioners  to  date   have  failed  to  recognize  the  importance  of  these  transactions  when  engaging  with   stakeholders  (p.  336).  Although  this  conception  has  been  around  since  antiquity,  the   relevance  of  emotion  is  still  frequently  overlooked.     It  was  through  the  manipulation  of  emotions  such  as  anger,  despair,  and   hope  that  classical  orators  could  sway  public  opinion  most  effectively  (DeSteno, Wegener, Petty, Rucker, & Braverman.,  2004,  p.43).  Many  ancient  Greeks,  however,   were  suspicious  of  pathos  due  to  its  potentially  manipulative  nature;  scholars  felt   that  the  presence  of  emotions  distracted  individuals  from  rationally  assessing  the   issue  at  hand  (Read,  2007,  p.  333).  In  contrast,  others  like  Aristotle,  believed  it  was   "a  force  that  needed  to  be  harnessed  when  seeking  to  make  persuasive  arguments"   (Read,  2007,  p.  332).  It  was  believed  that  a  person  who  mastered  the  ability  to   evoke  emotion  would  be  the  most  successful  rhetorician  (DeSteno  et  al.,  2004,  p.  43).   The  rationalization  for  this  can  be  grounded  today  in  new  psychoanalytical  models   of  the  human  mind  which  demonstrate  that,  "emotions  [do]  profoundly  influence   our  logical  faculties  without  us  realizing  it"  (Read,  2007,  p.  333).  Therefore,  an   effective  speaker  is  one  that  manages  to  influence  public  opinion  through  the   arousal  of  emotion.              16  

Ethos      The  second  mode  of  persuasion  that  is  recognized  in  Aristotlelian  rhetoric  is  

the  appeal  to  ethos,  or  to  one's  character.  When  a  speaker  successfully  highlights   his/her  reputation  in  a  positive  light,  it  can  be  argued  that  the  public  instills  a  higher   level  of  confidence  in  the  orator's  message.  Aristotle  expands  on  this  notion  in  a   passage  from  Rhetoric:  
Therefore  (we  have  a  case  of  persuasion)  through  character  when  the  speech  is  such   that  it  makes  the  speaker  worthy  of  belief.  For  we  believe  good  men  more  fully  and   quickly,  (and  that  is  true)  generally  concerning  ail  matters  and  absolutely  (so)  in   matters  that  are  not  precise  but  admit  doubt.  It  is  necessary  that  this  happen   through  the  speech,  rather  than  on  account  of  a  pre-existing  opinion  about  the   character  of  the  speaker.  For  not  as  some  writers  on  rhetoric  posit  in  their  treatises   (saying)  that  the  goodness  of  the  speaker  contributes  nothing  to  persuasion;  rather   character  has  almost  the  greatest  authority  in  winning  belief.  (Fortenbaugh,  1992,  p.   209)  

In  essence,  an  audience  is  more  likely  to  believe  a  speaker  who  is  perceived  as   respected  and  trusted  in  society.    In  Rhetoric,  Aristotle  identifies  three  attributes   that  make  up  such  a  persuasive  character;  wisdom,  virtue,  and  goodwill   (Fortenbaugh,  1992,  p.  210).  Orators  who  demonstrate  these  traits  are  likely  to  be   trusted  and  believed.    What  is  important  to  note  is  that  to  win  goodwill  is  to  exhibit   a  character  that  is  attractive  to  the  audience  ­  the  speaker  can  readily  achieve  this   when  the  audience  is  already  favourably  disposed  (Fortenbaugh,  1992,  p.  215).  It   becomes  more  challenging,  however,  when  the  audience  is  not  favorably  disposed.   This  is  usually  the  case  when  organizations  accused  of  wrongdoing  prepare  to   deliver  a  public  apology  to  an  already  skeptical  audience.    

  

17  

  

Thus,  appealing  to  ethos  can  be  a  highly  useful  rhetorical  strategy  that  public  

speakers  may  consider  using  when  attempting  to  influence  an  audience.  Aristotle   argues  that  swaying  public  opinion  can  be  done  most  effectively  by  an  orator  whose   character  is  perceived  as  good  and  credible.   Logos      The  last  mode  of  persuasion  identified  in  Aristotleian  rhetoric,  logos,  is  

concerned  with  the  ability  to  use  logic  as  a  means  for  argumentation.  It  depends  on   "...the  proof,  or  apparent  proof,  provided  by  the  words  of  the  speech  itself"   (Aristotle,  2010,  p.  7).  The  appeal  to  logos  is  influenced  by  the  actual  speech,  usually   on  the  occasion  that  a  truth,  or  apparent  truth,  has  been  proved  by  way  of   argumentation  on  the  subject  at  hand  (Aristotle,  2010,  p.  7).  As  the  developer  of   inductive  and  deductive  logic,  Aristotle  classifies  logos,  or  rational  argumentation,   as  the  most  important  way  of  persuading  the  audience  (Skerlep,  2001,  p.  180).   Typically  in  the  form  of  facts,  figures,  and  statistics,  data  can  be  used  as  a  means  of   rational  argumentation  ­  they  serve  as  evidence  in  support  of  what  the  speaker  is   attempting  to  communicate.  Presenting  evidence  is  a  valuable  way  to  persuade  the   public.  The  influential  power  of  data  is  explained  by  Denise  Troll  Covey  in  Using   Data  to  Persuade:  State  Your  Case  and  Prove  It  (2005)  as  she  discusses  the  ways  in   which  libraries  choose  to  validate  the  quality  of  their  services.  Covey  observes,  
Libraries  continue  to  gather  traditional  input  and  output  data  to  show  their   potential  to  provide  service  and  the  actual  service  they  provide.  These  are   meaningful  data,  but  the  more  purposeful,  effective  data  these  days  are  outcomes   and  performance  measures  that  show  what  good  libraries  do  and  how  well  they   perform  given  their  human  and  financial  resources.  Measures  of  efficiency,  

  

18  

effectiveness,  quality,  usability,  and  what  difference  the  library  make  are  much   needed  ­  and  very  persuasive  ­  in  an  era  pressured  for  accountability.  (p.  84)  

This  example  demonstrates  how  factual  information  can  be  presented  as  a  way  to   sway  public  perception.  By  exhibiting  facts,  figures,  and  statistics,  public  speakers   who  appeal  to  logos  are  able  to  frame  the  attitudes  of  the  audience  on  a  particular   subject.      Reiterating  the  principles  of  rhetoric,  Aristotle  sums  up  the  primary  

functions  of  logos,  ethos,  and  pathos:    
There  are,  then,  these  three  means  of  effecting  persuasion.  The  man  who  is  to  be  in   command  of  them  must,  it  is  clear,  be  able  (1)  to  reason  logically,  (2)  to  understand   human  character  and  goodness  in  their  various  forms,  and  (3)  to  understand  the   emotions  ­  that  is,  to  name  them  and  describe  them,  to  know  their  cases  and  the   way  in  which  they  are  excited.  (Fortenbaugh,  1992,  p.124)  

After  reviewing  the  three  means  of  persuasion,  it  can  be  argued  that  the   consideration  of  persuasive  appeals  in  public  apology  research  is  inadequate.  As   mentioned  in  the  introduction  of  this  MRP,  Aristotlelian  rhetoric  is  insufficiently   explored  in  public  relations  literature,  especially  on  the  topic  of  public  apologies   (Skerlep,  2001,  p.  177).    

Methodology  
   The  methods  I  used  for  my  research  include  (1)  collecting  data  using  a  

specific  set  of  criteria,  (2)  transcribing  that  data,  (3)  coding  for  persuasive  appeals   and  lastly,  (4)  an  in-depth  rhetorical  analysis.           19  

  

Data  Collection      For  the  purpose  of  my  research,  I  analyzed  a  total  of  seven  public  apologies.  

Considering  the  length  of  the  MRP,  I  feel  that  the  analysis  of  seven  apologies  will  be   sufficient  to  make  worthwhile  observations.  Since  there  have  been  countless  public   apologies  that  have  been  issued  to  date,  a  set  of  criteria  was  designed  to  help   narrow  down  the  selection.       Criteria   The  public  apologies  must  first  and  foremost  be  corporate  in  nature.  In  other   words,  the  apologies  must  have  been  released  by  a  large  commercial  business   authorized  to  act  as  a  single  entity  and  recognized  as  such  by  law.  Other  apologies   delivered  by  public  figures  such  as  politicians  or  celebrities  were  not  considered  for   this  project.   Secondly,  to  be  considered,  the  public  apologies  chosen  for  this  project  must   have  been  released  within  the  last  five  years.  This  ensures  that  the  results  and   conclusions  drawn  from  my  research  will  be  relevant  to  those  interested  in  studying   the  rhetorical  construction  of  corporate  public  apologies.  It  also  ensures  that  each   public  apology  originates  from  the  same  corporate  climate,  keeping  all  variables  as   consistent  as  possible.  Therefore,  all  public  apologies  released  before  2008  will  not   be  considered  for  this  paper.     I  also  focused  on  apologies  that  have  received  considerable  media  coverage   and  that  have  been  released  by  high  profile  companies  like  RIM,  Maple  Leaf  Foods   20  

  

and  BP  Oil.  My  rationalization  for  this  stems  from  the  fact  that  corporate  giants  have   larger  and  more  valuable  audiences  to  consider  and  to  `convert'.  There  is,  I  assume,   a  higher  degree  of  pressure  placed  on  these  organizations  to  influence  their   stakeholders  and  to  restore  trust.  This  is  beneficial  to  my  analysis,  assuming  that   these  organizations  have  employed  what  they  believe  to  be  the  most  effective   rhetorical  strategies.     Lastly,  only  Western  organizations  were  considered  for  this  project.  The   reason  for  this  has  less  to  do  with  the  limitations  of  language  than  the  fact  that   Western  culture,  in  a  corporate  context,  may  differ  from  others.  To  keep  this  paper   as  relevant  as  possible  to  my  own  audience,  I  decided  to  look  strictly  at  corporate   public  apologies  from  Canada,  the  United  States  and  the  United  Kingdom.  This  will   be  discussed  in  further  detail  in  my  limitations  section.     Method  of  Collection   After  navigating  through  a  variety  of  online  news  publications  for  media   coverage  on  corporate  public  apologies  matching  the  criteria  above,  I  narrowed   down  my  data  set  to  the  following  seven  apologies:   Company   Summary  of  Incident   A  FedEx  employee  was   caught  on  tape   throwing  a  customer's   cargo  over  a  fence.

Data  Transcription   Transcripts  of  the  video  apologies  were  retrieved  from  an  online  public   apology  database  belonging  to  the  University  of  Waterloo's  Conflict,  Culture  and   Memory  Lab  (CCM).  All  transcripts  could  be  accessed  through  CCM  free  of  charge   with  the  exception  of  two  apologies.  Missing  from  the  database  were  public   apologies  released  by  FedEx  and  Alaska  Airlines  in  2011.  The  transcript  of  the   former  was  retrieved  from  Lybio.net,  the  largest  online  community  of  scripted  text   video,  while  the  latter  required  a  manual  transcription.  All  transcripts  were  double   checked  for  accuracy  before  coding.     Coding   To  address  the  initial  research  questions  outlined  in  the  introduction,  I  went   through  each  public  apology  transcript  that  made  up  the  data  set  and  coded  for   instances  where  each  of  Aristotle's  three  rhetorical  appeals  ­  pathos,  ethos  and   logos  ­  were  used.  I  searched  every  apology  transcript  for  words,  phrases,   expressions  or  metaphors  that  appealed  to  emotion,  character,  and  logic,  and  took   note  of  how  many  times  a  specific  appeal  was  employed.  My  process  of  coding  was   conducted  at  a  sentence-by-sentence  level.     Operational  definitions        Since  at  times  the  appeals  to  pathos,  ethos  and  logos  can  have  slightly  

different  interpretations;  I  have  given  a  more  specific  definition  to  these  operational   concepts.  This  helped  to  eliminate  any  sense  of  ambiguity  in  the  coding  system.  

  

23  

Definition:  Appeal  to  Pathos   Pathos  can  be  observed  through  a  specific  use  of  diction.  It  can  be  identified   when  phrases  are  infused  with  emotional  language.  For  example,  in  a  recent  public   apology  issued  by  Scouts  Canada  to  the  children  who  have  suffered  sexual  abuse  at   the  hands  of  trusted  Scouters,  Chief  Commissioner  Steve  Kent  expresses  remorse  on   behalf  of  the  organization,  and  appeals  to  pathos  throughout  his  apology:    
Scouts  Canada  and  I  personally  wish  to  apologize  sincerely  and  deeply  to  any  and  all   former  scouts  who  suffered  harm  at  the  hands  of  those  who  abused  the  trust  and   responsibility  they  had  gained  as  volunteer  leaders  in  our  organization.  Our  sincere   efforts  to  stop  and  prevent  such  crimes  have  not  always  succeeded.  We  are  sorry  for   that.  We  are  saddened  at  any  resulting  harm.  

Words  like  sincerely  and  deeply  are  all  emotionally  charged,  and  can  have  an  effect   on  the  receiver  of  the  message.     To  clarify,  I  will  be  using  two  different  strategies  to  identify  what  I  mean  by   `emotional  language'.  The  first  strategy  is  through  the  use  of  intensifiers  ­  a   linguistic  element  that  conveys,  "the  degree  or  the  exact  value  of  the  quality   expressed  by  the  item  they  modify"  (Mendez-Naya,  2008,  p.  213).  Typically,  they  are   adverbs  such  as  greatly  or  completely  (Mendez-Naya,  2008,  p.  213).    These   intensifiers,  or  degree  modifiers,  have  a  markedly  emotional  function  (Mendez-Naya,   2003,  p.  372);  thus,  when  used  in  conjunction  with  neutral  language,  it  can  add  an   emotional  component  to  the  message.     The  second  strategy  is  through  the  identification  of  emotional  words  in   Bradley  and  Lang's  (1999)  study  on  Affective  Norms  for  English  Words  (ANEW),  a   set  of  "normative  emotional  ratings  for  a  large  number  of  words  in  the  English   24  

  

language"  (p.  1).  The  ANEW  (see  appendix  A)  is  a  collection  of  "verbal  materials  that   have  been  rated  in  terms  of  pleasure,  arousal,  and  dominance"  (Bradley  &  Lang,   1999,  p.1).  For  the  purposes  of  this  study,  I  will  strictly  be  referring  to  ratings  of   emotional  arousal  and  will  only  consider  a  word  to  be  emotionally  charged  if  the   mean  rating  is  above  4.5.  This  is  because  Bradley  &  Lang  (1999)  utilizes  a  9-point   rating  system  where  the  half-way  mark  (4.5)  represents  a  neutral  emotional  state.   Anything  above  4.5  on  the  scale  represents  an  increasing  degree  of  emotional   arousal,  while  numbers  under  4.5  signify  a  decreasing  level  of  arousal.   In  the  context  of  the  present  research,  pathos  can  also  be  identified  through   the  strategic  use  of  pronouns  such  as  "us"  and  "our".  These  pronouns  allow   organizations  to  place  themselves  on  an  equal  level  with  their  stakeholders,  giving   them  a  higher  degree  of  relatability.  This  creates  what  Ernest  G.  Bormann  calls  a   social  drama,  an  idea  that  derives  from  Bormann's  theory  of  Symbolic  Convergence:  
The  theory  explains  the  appearance  of  a  group  consciousness,  with  its  implied   shared  emotions,  motives,  and  meanings,  not  in  terms  of  individual  daydreams  and   scripts  but  rather  in  terms  of  socially  shared  narrations  or  fantasies.  (Bormann,   1985,  p.  128)  

  For  example,  in  Domino's  Pizza's  public  apology,  CEO  Patrick  Doyle  addressed  his   stakeholders  by  saying,  "we  want  to  thank  you  for  hanging  in  there  with  us".  The  use   of  pronouns  in  this  statement  helped  to  construct  a  sense  of  camaraderie  between   the  organization  and  its  stakeholders.  It  generated  what  Bormann  calls  a  shared   symbolic  drama  or  vision  (Cragan  &  Shields,  1977,  p.274).  In  this  case,  the  drama   being  played  out  was  the  idea  that  in  times  of  difficulty,  comrades  do  not  abandon   one  another,  but  are  instead  supportive  and  understanding.  This  strategy  is  able  to   25  

  

place  the  organization  in  a  state  of  weakness,  and  give  stakeholders  the  opportunity   to  demonstrate  compassion  through  forgiveness.  Victims  of  any  corporate  offence   do  not  wish  to  feel  inferior  to  the  transgressors,  which  is  why  apologies  are  usually   poorly  received  if  this  occurs.  Therefore,  if  the  use  of  a  single  or  multiple  pronouns   manages  to  create  the  type  of  social  drama  described  above,  I  will  consider  it  an   appeal  to  pathos.      In  short,  corporate  public  apologies  may  appeal  to  pathos  by  using  emotional  

language  (through  intensifiers  or  words  from  the  ANEW  with  a  4.5+  arousal  mean)   and  strategic  pronouns.   Definition:  Appeal  to  Ethos   In  order  to  define  ethos,  one  must  reference  Aristotle,  who  argued  that  a   speaker  is  persuasive  if  they  demonstrate  wisdom,  virtue,  and  goodwill   (Fortenbaugh,  1992,  p.  209).  These  characteristics  are  indicative  of  someone  who  is   trustworthy,  which  adds  credibility  to  their  message.    In  the  context  of  corporate   public  apologies,  organizations  must  also  prove  their  credibility  by  appealing  to  a   number  of  positive  attributes  in  order  to  issue  a  successful  response  to  charges  of   wrongdoing.     Ethos,  or  the  appeal  to  character,  can  be  identified  in  corporate  public   apologies  through  a  specific  use  of  language  or  statements  that  positively  reflect  the   following:  (1)  the  organization's  culture,  (2)  quality  of  products/services,  (3)   customer  value  creation,  (4)  external  relationships,  and  (5)  employees.  The   rationale  for  these  themes  derives  from  Cravens,  Oliver  and  Ramamoorti's  (2003)      26  

corporate  Reputation  Index  (see  appendix  B).  This  index  presents  nine  components   of  good  corporate  reputation  and  their  illustrative  measures.  From  this  index,  I  was   able  to  identify  five  components  that  were  present  in  my  data  set  of  corporate   public  apologies.  To  reiterate  these  components,  they  are  as  follows:  company   culture,  quality  of  products/services,  value  creation,  presence  of  external   relationships,  and  employees.  Therefore,  language  or  statements  used  to  positively   reflect  these  components  will  be  coded  as  an  appeal  to  ethos.   A  good  example  to  help  illustrate  the  above  would  be  the  2007  public   apology  released  by  JetBlue  airlines  expressing  remorse  for  the  countless  number  of   service  disruptions  caused  by  a  computer  malfunction.  JetBlue  stated,  "We  are   committed  to  you,  our  valued  customers,  and  are  taking  immediate  corrective  steps   to  regain  your  confidence  in  us".  The  word  committed  is  reminiscent  of  the   organization's  "responsiveness  to  customer  needs",  an  illustrative  measure  of  the   `value  creation'  component  of  the  Reputation  Index.  Similarly,  in  2005,  Best  Buy   publically  apologized  for  employing  high-pressure  sales  tactics,  which  left  many   customers  feeling  uncomfortable.  In  its  apology,  Best  Buy  claimed  that,  "In  fact,   these  behaviours  are  in  direct  conflict  with  our  desire  to  serve  customers'  needs   better  than  anyone  else,  and  our  values  of  honesty  and  integrity".  By  expressing  its   `desire  to  serve  customers'  this  statement  also  reflects  the  index's  `value  creation'   component.  What's  more,  Best  Buy  appeals  to  its  own  code  of  ethics  by  using  words   like  values,  honesty  and  integrity.  This  falls  under  the  index's  `culture'  component.  

  

27  

Thus,  when  appealing  to  ethos,  words  that  are  selected  seem  to  come  from  a   corporate  register.  In  other  words,  the  language  used  to  highlight  good  character   comes  from  a  word  bank  where  the  same  few  terms  are  used  frequently  and   repetitively.  Some  of  these  include  words  like  dedication,  quality,  and  regulatory.   Reflecting  themes  of  good  organizational  character  reminds  the  audience  of  the   company's  credibility  and  reputation  before  the  transgression  occurred.  By   strategically  choosing  words  that  echo  these  corporate  ideals,  apologies  are   appealing  to  the  audience's  own  code  of  ethics  and  expectations.     Definition:  Appeal  to  Logos   Lastly,  the  appeal  to  logos,  or  logic,  can  be  identified  in  corporate  public   apologies  when  facts,  figures,  or  statistics  are  used  to  persuade  the  audience.  It  was   Aristotle  who,  afterall,  emphasized  the  importance  of  rational  argumentation  using   evidence  (Skerlep,  2001,  p.  180).  In  this  context,  data  serves  as  proof  or  support  for   what  the  speaker  is  attempting  to  communicate.  This  way,  audience  members  are   presented  with  certain  facts  and  are  inclined  to  draw  specific  conclusions.  Numbers   are  commonly  found  in  public  apologies  to  illustrate  a  particular  picture  for  the   audience.  For  example,  in  2010  Akiyo  Toyoda  apologized  to  the  American  market  on   behalf  of  the  Toyota  Motor  Corporation  for  the  safety  oversights  of  their  vehicles,   stating  that,    
It  has  been  over  50  years  since  we  began  selling  in  this  great  country,  and  over  25   years  since  we  started  production  here.  And  in  the  process,  we  have  been  able  to   share  this  core  value  with  the  200,000  people  at  Toyota  operations,  dealers,  and   suppliers  in  this  country.  

  

28  

  By  mentioning  its  longevity  and  army  of  employees,  the  Toyota  Motor  Corporation   used  numbers  to  appeal  to  the  audience's  logic  and  encourages  them  to  perceive  the   company  in  a  certain  way.     In  the  context  of  corporate  public  apologies,  appealing  to  the  audience's  logic   can  also  be  intended  to  lessen  the  severity  of  the  issue  at  hand  or  to  place  blame   elsewhere.  For  example,  during  the  Listeriosis  crisis  at  Maple  Leaf  Foods  in  2008,   CEO  Michael  McCain  issued  a  public  apology,  reminding  stakeholders  that  "Even   though  Listeria  is  a  bacteria  commonly  found  in  many  foods  and  in  the  environment,   [they]  work  diligently  to  eliminate  it".  By  presenting  the  fact  that  Listeria  is  a   common  bacterium  found  in  our  every-day  environment,  Maple  Leaf  Foods  was   implying  that  the  outbreak  could  have  happened  to  any  organization.  Although  it  is   sometimes  subtle,  the  appeal  to  logos  can  be  a  powerful  and  persuasive  tool   Rhetorical  Analysis      After  coding  each  apology  for  appeals  to  pathos,  ethos  and  logos,  I  conducted  

an  overall  rhetorical  analysis.  Looking  specifically  at  the  persuasive  appeals  that   were  most  commonly  or  least  commonly  used,  I  was  able  to  draw  some  conclusions   from  the  data.    

Findings  
Having  given  each  rhetorical  appeal  a  comprehensible  operational  definition,   I  will  now  present  the  findings  of  my  rhetorical  analysis.    

  

29  

In  a  data  set  of  seven  corporate  public  apologies,  66  rhetorical  appeals  were   identified  in  total.  It  should  be  noted  here  that  all  charts  and  figures  represent   complete  data  rather  than  examples.  The  chart  below  illustrates  that  the  appeal  to   ethos  was  most  frequent,  with  31  observable  instances.  The  appeal  to  pathos  was   identified  21  different  times,  and  the  appeal  to  logos  was  identified  14  times.  In   short,  the  rhetorical  appeal  most  commonly  used  in  corporate  public  apologies  was   the  appeal  to  ethos.  The  rhetorical  appeal  used  least  frequently  was  the  appeal  to   logos.      
Figure  1.0

To  further  examine  these  findings,  I  will  discuss  my  observations  on  how  

corporate  public  apologies  managed  to  appeal  to  each  one  of  Aristotle's  modes  of   persuasion.   Findings:  Pathos      I  found  that  in  order  to  appeal  to  the  public's  emotions,  corporate  public  

apologies  employed  three  distinct  strategies.  The  first  strategy  involved  using   emotionally  charged  language  (more  specifically,  intensifiers)  while  apologizing  or   30  

  

expressing  sympathy.  Table  1.1  illustrates  the  ways  in  which  each  organization   belonging  to  the  data  set  delivered  their  apologies.  All  but  two  organizations  ­  RIM   and  FedEx  ­  appealed  to  pathos  while  expressing  their  regrets  to  the  public.  One   observable  trend  lies  in  the  fact  that  a  number  of  companies  issued  apologies   around  variations  of  reoccurring  words.  The  present  data  demonstrates  that   variants  of  the  word  deep  and  sincere  were  commonly  used  to  emphasize  apologies.    
Table  1.1

   The  second  strategy  involved  the  public  display  of  organizational  sentiment.     Table  1.2  shows  how  organizations  utilized  emotional  words  to  describe  their  own   feelings  to  the  public.  Four  out  of  seven  public  apologies  employed  this  strategy  in   order  to  appeal  to  pathos.  Words  such  as  sickens,  frustrating,  and  embarrassed  were   used  among  others  to  describe  the  current  emotional  states  of  the  organizations.

   Table  1.3  presents  the  arousal  ratings  as  presented  in  Bradley  &  Lang's  (1999)   ANEW  for  the  emotional  language  used  by  organizations  to  express  their  sentiments.   Each  word  had  a  mean  arousal  rating  of  4.5  or  higher,  which  placed  them  in  the   category  of  emotional  language.

   Lastly,  in  order  to  appeal  to  pathos,  I  found  that  corporate  public  apologies   had  the  tendency  to  use  pronouns  such  as  we  and  us  to  emphasize  a  seemingly  pre- established  relationship  between  stakeholder  and  organization.  As  discussed  in  the   Methodology  section,  above,  this  strategy  is  reminiscent  of  Bormann's  Symbolic   Convergence  theory  whereby  social  dramas  are  used  to  create  a  shared  group   consciousness  (Cragan  &  Shields,  1977,  p.274).  These  expressions  suggest  that  prior   to  the  transgression,  there  was  an  established  trusting  relationship  at  work.  Table   1.4  demonstrates  how  organizations  employed  the  use  of  pronouns  to  arouse  the   public's  emotions.

   Findings:  Ethos      Persuasion  through  ethos  or  character  was  the  most  prominent  rhetorical  

appeal  found  in  the  construction  of  corporate  public  apologies.  They  were  inclined   to  select  language  from  a  corporate  register  of  words  and  phrases  that  positively   reflect  (1)  the  organization's  culture,  (2)  quality  of  products/services,  (3)  customer   value  creation,  (4)  external  relationships,  and  (5)  its  employees.     Under  Cravens,  Oliver  and  Ramamoorti's  Reputation  Index  (2003),  the   Culture  component  includes  `ethics  policy'  as  one  of  its  illustrative  measures.  For   this  research,  I  am  making  the  assumption  that  the  term  ethics  refers  to  a  company's   outlook  on  the  ethical  practices  surrounding  all  aspects  of  its  work.  Table  2.0  shows   how  organizations  in  the  data  set  appealed  to  ethos  by  highlighting  its  corporate   culture  through  ethics  policy.

The  Reputation  Index  also  suggests  that  showcasing  an  organization's  ability  

to  create  customer  value  can  improve  its  image.  The  Value  Creation  component   provides  `identification  and  responsiveness  to  customer  needs'  as  an  illustrative   measure.  I  have  interpreted  this  as  an  organization's  commitment  to  its  customers.   In  my  analysis,  I  found  that  in  addition  to  highlighting  the  positive  culture  and   quality  associations  of  an  organization,  companies  might  also  express  their   commitment  to  their  stakeholders  as  a  rhetorical  strategy.  For  example,  in  the  2008   public  apology  issued  by  Maple  Leaf  Foods  after  Listeria  was  found  in  some  of  its   products,  CEO  Michael  McCain  stated  that  the  company  had  an  "unwavering   commitment"  to  keeping  its  customers'  food  safe.  He  ended  the  apology  by  saying,  "I   commit  to  you  that  our  actions  are  guided  by  putting  your  interest  first".  By   emphasizing  its  commitment  to  customers,  Maple  Leaf  Foods  highlighted  its  ability   to  create  customer  value,  which  indicated  a  positive  corporate  reputation.     According  to  the  index,  External  Relationships  are  also  an  indicator  of  high   corporate  reputation.  Described  as  the  `existence  of  alliance  relationships',  I  found   two  apologies  that  employed  this  strategy.  After  the  Gulf  spill  in  2010,  BP  stated  in   its  public  apology:  "For  the  strong  support  of  the  government,  thank  you".  By   demonstrating  visible  state  support,  it  is  more  likely  that  an  organization  will   succeed  in  motivating  the  public  to  view  them  as  a  credible  corporation.  A  year  prior,   Domino's  Pizza  was  caught  in  a  social  media  crisis  when  two  of  its  employees   uploaded  a  food-tampering  prank  video  onto  YouTube.  President  of  Domino's  USA   Patrick  Doyle  closed  the  apology  by  saying  "There  are  so  many  people  who  have   come  forward  with  messages  of  support  for  us  and  we  want  to  thank  you..."  By      35  

demonstrating  community  support,  there  is  a  higher  probability  that  public   perception  for  an  organization  will  be  more  positive.     Strengthening  Appeals  to  Ethos      The  most  noteworthy  of  my  findings  was  a  rhetorical  strategy  that  used  logos  

to  strengthen  appeals  to  ethos.  As  described  in  the  methodology  section,  the  appeal   to  logos,  or  logic,  can  be  identified  in  corporate  public  apologies  when  facts,  figures,   or  statistics  are  used  to  persuade  the  audience.  I  found  that  logos  was  frequently   used  to  influence  the  public's  perception  of  organizational  character.  In  other  words,   facts,  figures,  and  statistics  were  used  to  highlight  the  positive  attributes  of  a   company's  reputation  ­  the  ultimate  goal  of  ethos.  This  strategy  was  employed  most   often  to  show  that  a  company  is  a  long-standing  organization  with  a  high  degree  of   employee  loyalty/support.  Employees  are  often  used  as  indicators  of  organizational   reputation  (Cravens  &  Oliver,  2006,  p.  293)  and  are  a  component  of  Cravens  et  al.'s   (2003)  corporate  Reputation  Index  that  can  be  measured  by  an  employee's   satisfaction  with  his/her  employer.  Carmeli  and  Tishler  (2004)  show  that  human   capital  and  managerial  capabilities  (p.  1270)  both  "contribute  to  organizational   performance,  in  conjunction  with  perceived  organizational  reputation"  (Cravens  &   Oliver,  2006,  p.  293).  Thus,  I  argue  that  demonstrating  the  ability  to  retain  human   capital  is  indicative  of  employee  satisfaction  with  employers.  Employees  are   therefore  indicators  of  good  organizational  reputation,  which  rationalizes  how   corporations  choose  to  highlight  their  employees  in  public  apologies.  Table  2.2

demonstrates  how  organizations  utilize  logos,  or  facts,  figures  and  statistics,  to   showcase  the  employee  support  they  have.    
Table  2.2

      In  short,  I  found  that  in  corporate  public  apologies,  logos  was  used  to  

emphasize  the  presence  of  a  strong  employee  support  system,  which,  according  to   Cravens  et  al.'s  (2003)  index,  can  indicate  high  corporate  reputation.          Logos  was  also  used  to  appeal  to  ethos  in  other  ways  not  listed  in  the  

reputation  index.  The  general  success  of  a  company  may  be  highlighted  through  the   use  of  logos  by  referencing  the  longevity  and  geographical  scope  of  the  organization.   I  would  argue  that  the  longevity  of  a  company  can  at  times  be  indicative  of  long- term  success  while  geographical  scope  has  the  potential  to  demonstrate  high   profitability  ­  often  times,  it  can  be  assumed  that  only  profitable  organizations  have   the  opportunity  to  expand  globally.  For  example,  Maple  Leaf  Foods  references  their   century-old  brand  in  its  public  apology  when  CEO  Michael  McCain  stated,  "This  is   the  toughest  situation  we  have  faced  in  100  years  as  a  company".  Furthermore,   37  

  

Domino's  Pizza  alluded  to  its  geographical  scope  by  mentioning  that  it  has  locations   in  "more  than  60  countries  around  the  world".  These  figures  illustrate  how   companies  attempt  to  bolster  their  credibility  by  using  facts,  or  logos  appeals,  to   attest  to  positive  components  of  their  reputation.      Lastly,  in  BP's  apology,  the  organization  provided  numerical  figures  

concerning  the  resources  they  were  providing  to  help  clean  up  the  spill:  "More  than   2  million  feet  of  boom,  30  planes  and  over  1,300  boats  are  working  to  protect  the   shoreline".  This  statement  confirmed  the  organization's  commitment  to  taking   responsibility  for  the  accident  ­  an  act  I  would  argue  to  be  representative  of  the   organization's  culture  in  terms  of  ethics  policy.  As  Cravens  et  al.  (2003)  suggested  in   their  Reputation  Index,  positively  reflecting  organizational  culture  through  ethics   can  help  build  a  stronger  corporate  reputation.        Through  my  rhetorical  analysis  of  corporate  public  apologies,  I  found  that  the  

appeal  to  ethos  can  be  achieved  through  logos,  or  by  providing  facts,  figures  or   numbers  to  make  a  stronger,  more  persuasive  argument.  Components  of  the   Reputation  Index  that  were  positively  reflected  in  the  data  set  are  as  shown  in  table   2.3.

Findings:  Logos      My  final  observations  are  associated  with  appeals  to  logos.  I  found  that  logos  

was  the  rhetorical  strategy  used  least  in  the  construction  of  corporate  public   apologies.  Earlier,  I  discussed  how  logos  was  often  used  to  strengthen  appeals  to   ethos  or  good  organizational  character.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  in  one   other  occasion,  logos  was  employed  to  strengthen  an  emotional  appeal.    This  usage   was  found  in  BP  Oil's  public  apology  for  the  Gulf  spill.  Then-CEO  Tony  Hayward   explained  to  the  public  that,  "The  gulf  is  home  to  thousands  of  BP  employees  and   [they]  all  feel  the  impact".  By  strategically  presenting  the  fact  that  BP  employees   also  live  in  the  gulf,  the  oil  company  managed  to  communicate  that  it  too  was   suffering  from  the  negative  consequences  of  the  spill.  This  allowed  BP  to  play  on  the   audience's  emotions  by  attempting  to  arouse  sympathy  from  them.     In  essence,  I  found  that  logos  was  used  most  commonly  in  conjunction  with   other  rhetorical  appeals,  One  must  not,  however,  fail  to  overlook  the  instances  when   logos  was  used  in  isolation.  These  occurrences  can  be  highly  revealing  of  how  the   rhetorical  strategy  can  be  used  effectively  or  ineffectively.  Through  my  rhetorical   analysis,  I  took  note  of  three  incidents  where  logos  was  not  used  to  strengthen  or   support  another  appeal.        First,  in  the  public  apology  issued  by  Maple  Leaf  Foods,  Michael  McCain  

explained  that,  "...Listeria  is  commonly  found  in  many  foods  and  in  the   environment..."  This  factual  information  is  an  appeal  to  logos,  whose  function  will   be  revisited  in  the  Discussion  section  of  this  paper.    

  

39  

  

Another  instance  where  the  appeal  to  logos  was  used  in  isolation  can  be  

found  in  the  public  apology  issued  by  Alaska  Airlines  in  2011  due  to  a  severe  service   disruption.  The  organization  provided  precise  statistics  regarding  flight   cancellations  and  passengers  affected:  "And  as  of  mid-day,  the  two  airlines  have   combined  to  cancel  around  140  flights.  And  unfortunately,  these  cancellations  have   affected  nearly  12,000  of  our  passengers".    The  chart  below  (3.0)  is  a  visual   depiction  of  how  appeals  to  logos  are  used  in  corporate  public  apologies.

Non-Isolated  Logos  

   To  summarize,  out  of  all  seven  corporate  public  apologies  the  appeal  to  logos   was  used  primarily  to  strengthen  appeals  to  ethos.  Facts,  figures  and  statistics  were   primarily  used  to  showcase  an  organization's  positive  character.  This  was  managed   by  organizations  through  the  referencing  of  company  culture,  quality  of   products/services,  ability  to  create  customer  value,  external  relationships,  and  its   employees.  It  should  be  noted  that  only  two  organizations  employed  the  use  of  logos   in  isolation.  These  findings  will  be  dissected  more  thoroughly  in  the  following   discussion  section.     40  

  

Discussion  
   In  this  section,  I  will  be  conducting  an  in-depth  discussion  on  the  results  of   my  study.  There  are  some  noteworthy  findings  that  should  be  explored  in  order  to   better  understand  the  rhetorical  strategies  involved  in  the  construction  of  corporate   public  apologies.     RQ  1:  Which  rhetorical  appeals  are  used  in  the  construction  of  corporate   public  apologies?     After  analyzing  the  contents  of  my  data  set,  it  is  clear  that  organizations   employ  the  use  of  ethos,  pathos,  and  logos  as  methods  of  persuasion.  Some  appeals,   however,  are  more  prominent  than  others.  This  leads  me  to  address  my  second   research  question:   RQ  2:  Which  of  these  strategies  is  most  commonly  used?   Figure  4.0  presents  the  rhetorical  makeup  of  my  data  set  by  percentage.   Forty-seven  percent  of  the  rhetorical  appeals  used  in  my  sample  were  appeals  to   ethos.  This  can  be  rationalized  by  the  fact  that  public  apologies  have  the  overarching   goal  of  coming  to  the  reputational  defence  of  an  organization  in  the  face  of  intense   criticism  (Greenberg  &  Elliott,  2009,  p.  194).  In  attempts  to  defend  one's  reputation   after  a  transgression,  it  is  important  to  point  out  the  positive  attributes  of  an   organization  to  the  critical  (and  skeptical)  public.  By  appealing  to  indicators  of  good   corporate  reputation,  such  as  ethical  company  culture,  high  quality   products/services,  and  supportive  external  relationships  (Cravens  et  al.  2003),  an   41  

  

organization  is  able  to  remind  the  public  of  its  good  reputation  prior  to  the  incident   of  misconduct.  Thus,  the  appeal  to  ethos  corresponds  with  the  primary  function  of  a   public  apology,  which  is  to  repair  a  damaged  corporate  reputation  and  to  prevent   that  damage  from  getting  exacerbated  (Greenberg  &  Elliott,  2009,  p.  194).  This  may   explain  the  finding  that  the  most  prominent  rhetorical  appeal  used  in  the   construction  of  corporate  public  apologies  is  the  appeal  to  ethos.

   Discussion:  Ethos      As  presented  in  the  findings,  appeals  to  ethos  tend  to  positively  reflect  

several  components  of  Cravens  et  al.'s  (2003)  Reputation  Index.  According  to  figure   4.1,  positive  aspects  of  a  company's  organizational  culture  were  emphasized  most   frequently,  which,  in  the  context  of  this  study,  is  measured  by  their  ethics  policy   (Cravens  et  al.,  2003).

Corporate  public  apologies  are  usually  responses  to  acts  of  wrongdoing  or   misconduct.  These  acts  are  the  very  elements  that  challenge  or  contradict  an   organization's  code  of  ethics.  Kathleen  Gill  (2000)  states  that,  "in  offering  the   apology,  the  offender  exercises  the  moral  capacities  that  seem  to  have  failed  in   committing  the  offense.  After  such  a  display,  the  offender  may  be  reestablished  as  a   more  trustworthy  and  respectable  member  of  the  community"  (p.  24).   It  is  therefore  sensible  for  any  publically  criticized  organization  to  first  take  on  the   task  of  countering  negative  public  opinion  about  their  ethical  policies.  For  instance,   when  a  FedEx  employee  was  captured  on  tape  throwing  a  customer's  plasma   computer  monitor  over  a  fence,  the  company  asserted  that  the  act  "goes  directly   against  all  FedEx  values"  (Fedex,  2011).    By  highlighting  the  positive  attributes  of   both  their  work  and  moral  ethics,  companies  attempt  to  secure  their  positive  ethical   reputations.     43  

  

The  second  component  of  the  Reputation  Index  that  was  stressed  most  was   the  quality  of  a  company's  products  and  services.  This  strategy  is  employed  to   assure  the  public  that  any  acts  of  misconduct  or  wrongdoing  are  isolated  incidents   that  do  not  affect  the  quality  of  a  company's  products  or  services.  I  argue  that  by   appealing  to  quality  associations,  organizations  are  able  to  deflect  the  public's   attention  away  from  the  negative  aspects  of  the  transgression.  For  example,  when   Toyota  USA  apologized  for  a  sticking  pedal  situation  in  recalled  Toyota  vehicles,   President  Jim  Lentz  reminded  the  public  that,  "Toyota  has  always  prided  itself  on   building  high  quality,  durable  cars..."  This  communicated  to  public  stakeholders  that   despite  the  recall,  Toyota  still  remained  a  quality  brand.     It  is  unsurprising  that  the  third  component  most  frequently  highlighted  is  an   organization's  employees.    As  mentioned  earlier  in  the  findings,  employees  are   indicators  of  good  corporate  reputation;  it  is  not  possible  to  create  quality  products   and  services  without  the  support  of  employees  (Cravens  &  Oliver,  2006,  p.  294).   Every  organization  in  the  data  set  (with  the  exception  of  RIM)  appealed  to  ethos  by   highlighting  the  strong  support  of  their  staff.     Appealing  to  ethos  through  ethics  policy  and  quality  association  was  not  as   common  across  the  entire  data  set.  In  terms  of  highlighting  positive  ethics  policy,   only  four  out  of  seven  organizations  mentioned  this  component  in  their  public   apology.  Two  out  of  seven  organizations  chose  not  to  make  reference  to  the  quality   of  their  products  or  services,  while  only  one  left  out  any  mention  of  their  employees.   Figure  4.2  illustrates  these  findings.

      Companies  referenced  their  employees  through  the  provision  of  numerical  

figures  which  is  one  way  logos  appeals  were  executed.  The  most  noteworthy  finding   of  this  study  is  concerned  with  the  ways  in  which  logos  is  used  to  strengthen  such   appeals  to  ethos,  and  in  one  incident,  the  appeal  to  pathos.  As  previously  discussed,   logos  can  be  identified  in  instances  where  facts,  figures  or  statistics  were  used  as   evidence  for,  in  most  cases,  good  organizational  character.  Since  we  are  in  an  era   that  pressures  for  accountability  (Covey,  2005,  p.  84),  data  ­  especially  measurable   data  ­  can  be  very  persuasive  when  presented  strategically  (Covey,  2005,  p.  84).    In   essence,  the  findings  suggest  that  the  strategic  employment  of  logos  in  corporate   public  apologies  occurs  when  data  is  used  as  a  supportive  or  strengthening  agent.   The  following  section  will,  however,  also  account  for  appeals  to  logos  used  in   isolation  ­  a  persuasive  strategy  I  argue  to  be  tactless.      45  

  

Discussion:  Logos      The  appeal  to  logos  was  the  rhetorical  strategy  used  the  least  in  my  sample  

set  of  corporate  apologies.  Logos  was  identified  only  14  times  across  all  seven  public   apologies.  Seventy-six  percent  (11  out  of  14)  of  the  logos  appeals  were  used  to   strengthen  other  rhetorical  appeals,  in  particular  ethos.    The  charts  below  (figures   4.3  and  4.4)  provide  a  comparative  view  on  how  logos  was  used.  Chart  4.3  shows   the  number  of  times  logos  is  observed,  while  chart  4.4  recodes  any  incidents  where   logos  was  used  to  strengthen  ethos  or  pathos  as  strictly  appeals  to  ethos  and  pathos.   This  leaves  only  three  incidents  where  logos  was  used  in  isolation.

What  these  findings  suggest  is  that  logos  was  rarely  employed  as  a  rhetorical  

strategy  on  its  own.  It  was  almost  always  used  to  support  or  strengthen  other   rhetorical  appeals,  mainly  ethos,  or  good  organizational  character.  To  dissect  the   reasons  as  to  why  logos  was  rarely  used  in  isolation,  I  will  be  analyzing  the  three   incidents  where  this  strategy  was  employed.      The  first  was  one  that  was  mentioned  in  an  earlier  section  of  this  paper.  

Maple  Leaf  Foods  issued  a  public  apology  in  response  to  a  Listeria  outbreak  in  some   of  its  products,  which  led  to  illness  and  loss  of  life.  The  appeal  to  logos  can  be   identified  when  CEO  Michael  McCain  stated,  "Even  though  Listeria  is  a  bacteria   commonly  found  in  many  foods  and  in  the  environment,  we  work  diligently  to   eliminate  it".  I  argue  that  by  asserting  that  Listeria  is  a  common  bacteria  found  in   our  environment,  Maple  Leaf  Foods  appeared  to  be  using  strategies  of  diminution.  

Diminution involves "explanations or excuses that attempt to reduce the severity of the offender's actions" (Boyd, 2011, p. 302). For  Kathleen  Gill,  (2000)  
justifications,  explanations,  and  excuses  are  all  forms  of  remedial  strategies  and  can   be  referred  to  as  accounts  (p.  12).  An  account  is  "a  statement  made  by  a  social  actor   to  explain  unanticipated  or  untoward  behaviour"  (Gill,  2000,  p.  12).  When   organizations  give  accounts,  they  are  providing  explanations  for  the  actions,  which   lead  to  a  freeing  of  blameworthiness  (Gill,  2000,  p.  12).  The  appeal  to  logos   identified  in  Maple  Leaf  Foods'  apology  functioned  as  a  strategy  of  diminution.   Pontari, Schlenker, and Christopher.(2002)  argue  that  the  public  can  be  unreceptive   towards  excuse  makers:  

  

47  

...the  public's  (and  our  own)  sometimes  frustrated  or  fed-up  response  to  excuse   makers  would  suggest  that  such  explanations  do  not  provide  absolution  for   wrongdoings,  and  in  fact,  can  create  images  of  and  opinions  toward  excuse  makers   that  are  less  than  desirable.  (p.  498)  

Thus,  appealing  to  logos  in  isolation  may  be  misinterpreted  as  an  organization's   attempt  to  provide  excuses  or  justifications  for  the  transgression.  This  can  be   considered  a  rationale  for  why  logos  was  employed  so  rarely  as  a  rhetorical  strategy   on  its  own.      The  remaining  two  logos  appeals  identified  in  the  sample  both  came  from  

Alaska  Airlines'  public  apology  for  major  service  disruptions  in  2011.  The  company   stated  that,  "...the  two  airlines  have  combined  to  cancel  around  140  flights"  and  that   the  cancellations  "...have  affected  nearly  12,000  of  [its]  passengers."  In  these  two   incidents,  the  appeals  to  logos  were  used  to  highlight  negative  aspects  of  the   situation  rather  than  to  strengthen  other  rhetorical  appeals  such  as  ethos  and   pathos.  As  mentioned  in  the  literature  review,  Covey  (2005)  emphasizes  the   persuasive  power  of  presenting  factual  or  numeric  data.  Using  numbers  to  highlight   the  negative  aspects  of  a  company's  performance  can  be  more  detrimental  to  its   reputation;  I  argue  that  rather  than  presenting  numerical  estimates,  Alaska  Airlines   should  have  generalized  their  statement  by  using  words  such  as  many  or  numerous.   These  words  may  even  lessen  the  severity  of  the  situation  since  they  come  across  as   vague,  whereas  the  provision  of  estimated  numbers  and  figures  achieve  the   opposite  result.            To  summarize,  my  findings  indicated  that  the  appeal  to  logos  was  seldom  

used  in  isolation.  In  the  events  where  logos  was  used  as  its  own  strategy,  I  argue   48  

  

that  it  threatened  the  organizational  reputation  of  the  company.  Firstly,  I  observed   how  using  facts,  figures  or  statistics  in  corporate  public  apologies  may  be  perceived   as  a  strategy  of  diminution  or  a  means  to  justify  an  organization's  actions.  Secondly,   by  strictly  appealing  to  logos,  I  observed  how  this  strategy  was  used  to  highlight  the   negative  aspects  of  a  company's  performance.  There  is  not  one  case  in  my  sample   that  demonstrated  the  use  of  logos  to  be  an  effective  rhetorical  strategy  on  its  own.   Discussion:  Pathos      The  final  research  question  is  concerned  with  how  rhetorical  strategies  are  

employed  through  the  use  of  language.  The  remainder  of  this  discussion  section  will   address  this.  The  last  rhetorical  strategy  that  will  be  assessed  in  this  discussion  is   the  appeal  to  pathos  or  emotion.  Using  intensifiers  as  a  means  to  arouse  emotion   was  a  noteworthy  tactic.  According  to  my  findings,  emotional  intensifiers  were   employed  only  during  the  expression  of  remorse,  or  an  apology.  In  one  instance,  an   intensifier  was  identified  when  a  company  offered  its  sympathies  to  the  victims;   however,  for  the  most  part,  intensifiers  were  used  to  accentuate  an  organization's   expression  of  remorse.  This  indicated  that  the  actual  act  of  apologizing  is  a  highly   significant  element  of  the  corporate  public  apology.    In  short,  when  issuing  the   actual  apology,  organizations  hope  to  arouse  a  level  of  emotion  in  the  public  by   using  intensifiers  as  a  rhetorical  strategy.  This  positions  the  act  of  apologizing  as  a   necessary  component  of  corporate  apologia.  Companies  are  no  longer  addressing   their  stakeholders  in  a  strictly  defensive  manner;  rather,  they  are  fixated  on  the   reconciliation  and  reparation  of  relationships  by  which  the  admittance  of  guilt  is   49  

  

now  the  primary  focus  (Rowland  &  Koesten,  2004,  p  68).      Another  significant  trend  that  I  observed  in  my  research  was  the  

humanization  of  corporations.  In  today's  society,  corporations  are  often  portrayed   as  "...greedy,  impersonal,  and  completely  indifferent  to  the  effects  their  activities   have  on  society"  (Dominick  &  Williams,  1996,  p.  55).  Even  in  the  court  of  law,  Paul  A.   Dominick  and  Turner  B.  Williams  (1996)  argue  that  defence  lawyers  must  present   corporations  as  responsible  and  conscientious  individuals,  rather  than  as  faceless   entities  (p.  55).  By  humanizing  the  corporation,  lawyers  are  able  to  persuade   members  of  the  jury  to  become  "...more  sensitive  to  the  harmful  effects  that  an   adverse  judgment  could  have  on  individuals  within  the  corporation,  rather  than  the   corporate  entity"  (Dominick  &  Williams,  1996,  p.55).  This  is  precisely  the  rhetorical   strategy  that  organizations  employed  in  public  apologies  when  appealing  to  pathos   through  the  expression  of  organizational  sentiment.      As  observed  in  my  findings,  organizations  tended  to  express  their  own  

personal  sentiments  using  emotional  language  in  corporate  public  apologies.  One   example  was  when  FedEx's  Senior  Vice-President  stated  that  he  was  "upset  and   embarrassed"  by  the  behaviour  of  one  of  their  couriers.  In  addition  to  arousing   emotion,  I  argue  that  CEOs  and  other  authoritative  figures  expressed  their   sentiments  with  the  goal  of    humanizing  their  company.  The  common  belief  that  `all   humans  make  mistakes'  may  better  persuade  stakeholders  to  accept  an   organization's  apology  and  forgive  them  for  their  wrongdoings.  Therefore,  by   including  organizational  sentiments  in  public  apologies,  corporations  are  portrayed   50  

  

in  a  more  humanized  light.  This,  as  Dominick  and  Williams  (1996)  assert,  persuades   the  public  to  accept  the  apology.        Lastly,  the  appeal  to  pathos  was  used  to  create  what  Bormann  (1985)  calls  

social  dramas.  By  strategically  employing  the  use  of  pronouns  like  you  and  us,   organizations  managed  to  construct  an  imagined  social  situation.  When  fabricated,   these  dramas  place  the  audience  in  a  fictional  role  that  helps  to  fulfill  the  interests  of   the  speaker.  For  example,  in  the  context  of  corporate  public  apologies,  these  social   themes  positioned  the  public  and  the  organization  as  comrades,  overriding  the  more   realistic  roles  of  victim  and  transgressor.  By  reinforcing  such  fantasy  themes,  an   organization  may  appear  less  foreign  to  its  audience  and  motivate  the  public  to   accept  the  organization's  message.      What  these  findings  suggest  is  that  rational  argumentation  can  at  times  be  

fruitless  when  emotional  threats  are  involved  (Read,  2007,  p.  337).  It  is  therefore   important  for  public  relations  practitioners  to  recognize  the  need  for  emotional   appeals.  
...It  then  becomes  important  to  understand  how  tone  and  language  can  be  used  to   help  steer  communications.  To  ensure  that  language  evokes  the  necessary   emotional  responses  corporate  spokespeople  need  to  gain  access  to  a  range  of   rhetorical  techniques.  (Read,  2007,  p.  337)  

   In  respect  to  corporate  public  apologies,  these  techniques  may  include  strategies   that  involve  intensifying  expressions  of  remorse,  communicating  organizational  

sentiments  and  constructing  social  dramas.  Each  of  these  tactics  has  the  ability  to   arouse  public  emotion.  When  employed  strategically,  a  rhetorician  may  be  able  

  

51  

steer  these  emotions  in  a  certain  direction.     By  constructing  public  apologies  using  the  most  suitable  rhetorical  appeals,   organizations  have  the  potential  to  regain  control  over  their  image  and  reputation.   By  utilizing  each  method  of  persuasion  strategically,  it  is  possible  to  restore  the   trust  of  skeptical  stakeholders.      

Limitations  
   Unfortunately,  this  study  does  not  come  without  limitations.  There  are  four  

factors  that  must  be  taken  into  consideration  before  applying  this  research  to  the   future  study  of  corporate  public  apologies.  The  limitations  are  as  follows:  sample   size,  cultural  relativity,  outcome  and  severity,  and  social  cues.   Sample  Size      The  current  research  was  based  on  a  data  set  of  7  corporate  public  apologies  

released  between  2008-2012.  This  sample  size  was  hardly  a  representative  sample.   Ideally,  a  study  on  public  apologies  would  include  many  more.  Paul  Slansky  and   Arleen  Sorkin,  authors  of  My  Bad:  25  Years  of  Public  Apologies  and  the  Appalling   Behaviour  That  Inspired  Them  says  that,  "there  have  been  over  200  public  apologies   issued  in  2006"  alone  (Johnson,  2009).  Therefore,  it  must  be  acknowledged  that  the   current  sample  size  was  much  too  small  to  form  any  conclusions  regarding  the  ways   in  which  corporate  public  apologies  are  rhetorically  constructed.              52  

  

Cultural  Relativity      Another  factor  that  must  be  taken  into  consideration  is  the  cultural  

limitations  of  the  study.  The  corporate  public  apologies  that  were  retrieved  came   from  Western  companies:     · · · · · · · Maple  Leaf  Foods  (Canada)   Toyota  USA  (USA)   RIM  (Canada)   BP  Oil  (UK)   Domino's  Pizza  (USA)   Alaska  Airlines  (USA)   FedEx  (USA)  

The  ways  in  which  Western  corporations  apologize  can  differ  from  those  belonging   to  other  cultures.  Therefore,  the  findings  of  this  study  may  not  be  applicable  to   organizations  outside  the  West.  In  1997,  a  comparative  study  on  Japanese  and   American  apology  styles  was  published  in  the  Communication  Research  journal.   Naomi  Sugimoto  (1997)  revealed  several  cultural  differences  in  the  use  of  strategies   when  issuing  an  apology.  One  difference  that  is  relevant  to  the  current  study  is  the   way  in  which  remorse  is  expressed.  Japanese  apologies  tend  to  use  more  repetition   in  their  statements  of  remorse  (e.g.,  `Sorry,  sorry,  I'm  very  sorry"),  whereas   American  apologies  used  more  intensified  statements  (e.g.,  "I'm  terribly  sorry")   (Sugimoto,  1997,  p.  360).  According  to  my  earlier  findings,  the  word  `terribly'  is  an   intensifier,  a  rhetorical  strategy  used  to  appeal  to  the  audience's  emotions.   Intensifiers  were  found  to  be  one  of  three  strategies  employed  in  corporate  public   apologies  to  arouse  public  emotion.  It  can  be  argued  that  this  strategy  may  be  less   effective  in  a  Japanese  context.  Therefore,  the  act  of  apologizing  can  be  culturally   relative  and  should  be  taken  into  consideration.   53  

  

Severity      Another  consideration  this  study  failed  to  acknowledge  was  the  gravity  of  

each  individual  situation.  Each  event  to  which  the  public  apologies  were  responding   had  varying  degrees  of  severity.  For  example,  both  BP  Oil  and  Maple  Leaf  Foods   were  responding  to  organizational  crises  that  involved  the  loss  of  life,  whereas  RIM   and  Alaska  Airlines  were  apologizing  for  mere  service  disruptions.  The  severity  of   these  issues  lacked  assessment  and  may  have  impacted  the  ways  in  which  their   corresponding  apologies  were  strategically  constructed.        Chart  5.0  below  shows  the  number  of  rhetorical  appeals  used  by  each  

organization  in  their  public  apologies.  It  may  be  worth  asking  whether  or  not  there   is  a  positive  correlation  between  the  number  of  rhetorical  appeals  and  the  gravity  of   the  issue.  Looking  at  the  chart,  Maple  Leaf  Foods  and  BP  Oil  employed  the  most     rhetorical  strategies  in  their  responses.  Interestingly,  both  of  these  events  resulted   in  loss  of  life,  the  most  severe  outcome  of  any  organizational  crisis.  
Figure  5.0

Thus,  for  future  research,  I  would  recommend  that  the  severity  of  the  crises  

be  assessed  appropriately.   Social  Cues      One  other  limitation  is  the  lack  of  acknowledgement  for  the  presence  of  

social  cues.  J.B.  Walther  (2007)  explains  how  social  cues  can  comprise  facial   expressions,  body  language,  and  tone  of  voice,  and  can  provide  the  basis  of  first   impressions  (p.  2439).  I  argue  that  these  cues  can  be  revealing  of  a  speaker's  own   emotions  (passion,  compassion,  sympathy  etc.)  as  well  as  character  (eloquence,   style  of  dress,  etc.).  These  can  be  considered  strategies  of  persuasion,  and  can   influence  the  public  perception  of  an  organization.      One  example  can  be  drawn  from  BP  Oil's  crisis  management  efforts  after  the

Macondo oil well spilled over 184 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico (O'Connor, 2011, p. 1959). For the American people, BP's spokesperson Tony Hayward came across as elitist and arrogant when he expressed remorse for the spill (O'Connor, 2001, p. 1986). In one incident, Hayward arrived on the beach in expensive, high-end business attire while expressing his frustrations to the media over the amount of time he'd had to commit to managing the oil spill which, for O'Connor (2011),"suggested that he was an elite who had much better things to do than work for the welfare of the victims of the spill..." (p. 1986). This idea was later confirmed when the media published photos of Hayward with his son at a yacht race on the Isle of Wight (O'Connor, 2011, 0. 1986). What's more, Hayward's nationality also had an impact on the public's perception of BP.

  

55  

For O'Connor (2011), "his British accent probably exacerbated the negative connotations of his resentful statements because it pegged him and the company as foreign nonAmericans who might not care much about the U.S. coastline" (p. 1986). The way Hayward spoke sounded arrogant to Americans, who may have been reminded of "their former colonization and awakened the long-held belief that the British view themselves as socially superior" (O'Connor, 2011, p. 1986). Effectiveness Finally, it is also worth noting that the effectiveness of the strategies identified in this study was not taken into consideration. This MRP makes the assumption that the rhetorical tactics used in the corporate public apologies led to a positive outcome for the organizations. Since the aftermath of the crises was not assessed, I am unable to conclude how effective each method of persuasion was. Thus, through the mere analysis of public apology transcripts, one may overlook the influential power of social cues. It is possible for organizations to take advantage of these cues and use them effectively as methods of persuasion.  

Conclusion  
   There  is  much  to  say  about  the  rhetorical  construction  of  corporate  public  

apologies.  The  persuasive  stratagems  identified  in  this  study  are  meant  to  serve  as   guidelines  for  public  relations  practitioners  who  are  unfamiliar  with  rhetorical   appeals.  Through  the  analysis  of  several  public  apologies  issued  by  high  profile   companies,  I  have  discussed  a  number  of  rhetorical  devices  that  organizations  use  to  

  

56  

respond  to  criticism.  The  purpose  of  these  devices  is  to  influence  the  public  and   inspire  them  to  reinstate  their  trust.  As  such,  the  rhetorical  appeals  employed  in   corporate  public  apologies  are  valuable  entities  that  should  be  observed  on  a  larger   scale.  To  summarize,  the  strategies  observed  are  as  follows:   Ethos   1. Use  language  that  positively  reflects  organizational  reputation  (especially   themes  regarding  employee  support,  quality  associations,  and  organizational   culture).   Logos   2. Use  logos  appeals  to  strengthen  other  rhetorical  devices  rather  than  in   isolation   Pathos   3. Use  intensifiers  to  emphasize  expressions  of  remorse   4. Humanize  the  company  by  expressing  organizational  sentiments   5. Draw  the  public  into  constructed  social  dramas  by  using  strategic  pronouns   These  5  rhetorical  strategies  were  observed  in  a  data  set  comprised  of  7   corporate  public  apologies,  whose  outcomes  were  not  adequately  assessed.  A   limitation  is  that  these  strategies  were  employed  without  properly  examining  the   aftermath  of  the  crises.  The  question  that  remains  is  whether  or  not  these  strategies   were  successful  in  persuading  the  public  to,  once  again,  view  these  organizations  as   reputable  entities.  It  is  only  by  making  the  assumption  that  each  public  apology      57  

analyzed  for  this  project  played  a  role  in  salvaging  the  company's  image  that  I  make   the  following  recommendations:   In  the  event  that  an  organization  is  required  to  issue  a  public  apology,  PR   practitioners  and  professional  communicators  should  consider  following  these  five   guidelines  in  order  to  effectively  communicate  to  the  public.  It  is  imperative  that   future  studies  on  this  topic  be  conducted  using  a  different  form  of  analysis  where   the  sample  size  can  be  considered  representative.  The  limitations  of  this  study   should  also  be  addressed  in  any  future  attempts  to  analyze  the  rhetorical  makeup  of   corporate  public  apologies.        In  an  age  where  the  mistrust  of  organizations  is  burgeoning,  the  topic  of  

effective  public  apology  should  be  increasingly  relevant  to  organizations.    What  is   most  alarming  is  that  that  even  the  actions  of  an  organization's  members  can  now   have  detrimental  consequences  to  the  company's  image  and  reputation  strictly  by   association.  For  this  reason,  it  is  not  only  those  in  control  of  businesses  that  should   understand  the  functionality  of  rhetoric;  it  is  every  social  actor  associated  with  one.   Especially  in  an  age  of  what  Slansky  and  Sorkin  (2006)  call  `political  correctness',   everyone  is  more  accountable  for  what  they  say  and  what  they  do  than  ever  before.  
One  factor  contributing  to  the  current  apology  glut  is  the  advent  of  political   correctness,  which,  while  making  it  no  longer  okay  to  say  one  doesn't  like  black   people  (or  gay  people,  or  poo  people,  or  Jews,  or  whomever),  fails  to  keep  a  lot  of   people  from  saying  precisely  such  things  anyway,  and  then  demands  that  they  feign   sorrow.  The  patently  bogus  retractions  that  follow  are  by  definition  inadequate,   because  what  they're  basically  saying  is  `I'm  sorry  I  was  unable  to  keep  my  true   awfulness  hidden'.  And  we're  all  sorry  we  had  to  see  it,  but  you  know,  whatever.  (p.   2)  

  

58  

The  relevance  of  effective  apology  is,  once  again,  an  increasingly  important  topic  for   public  relations  professionals.  By  understanding  the  function  of  rhetorical  appeals,  a   corporate  public  apology  can  be  constructed  successfully  and  reap  prosperous   results  for  an  organization.                                             59

Appendix  C   Maple  Leaf  Foods  (2008)   My  name  is  Michael  McCain.  As  you  may  know,  Listeria  was  found  in  some  of  our   products.  Even  though  Listeria  is  a  bacteria  commonly  found  in  many  foods  and  in   the  environment,  we  work  diligently  to  eliminate  it.  When  Listeria  was  discovered   in  the  product,  we  launched  immediate  recalls  to  get  it  off  the  shelf.  Then  we  shut   the  plant  down.  Tragically,  our  products  have  been  linked  to  illnesses  and  loss  of  life.   To  Canadians  who  were  ill  and  to  the  families  who  have  lost  loved  ones,  I  offer  my   deepest  sympathies.  Words  cannot  begin  to  express  our  sadness  for  your  pain.   Maple  Leaf  Foods  is  23  000  people  who  live  in  a  culture  of  food  safety.  We  have  an   unwavering  commitment  to  keeping  your  food  safe  with  standards  well  beyond   regulatory  requirements.  But  this  week,  our  best  efforts  failed  and  we  are  deeply   sorry.  This  is  the  toughest  situation  we  have  faced  in  100  years  as  a  company.  We   know  this  has  shaken  your  confidence  in  us.  I  commit  to  you  that  our  actions  are   guided  by  putting  your  interest  first.                                                      69  

  

Appendix  D   Domino's  Pizza  (2009)   Hello,  I'm  Patrick  Doyle,  president  of  Domino's  USA.  Recently,  we  discovered  a  video   of  two  dominoes  team  members  who  thought  that  their  acts  would  be  a  funny   YouTube  hoax.  We  sincerely  apologize  for  this  incident.  We  thank  members  of  the   online  community  who  quickly  alerted  us  and  allowed  us  to  take  immediate  action.   Although  the  individuals  in  question  claim  it's  a  hoax,  we  are  taking  this  incredibly   seriously.  This  was  an  isolated  incident  in  Conover,  North  Carolina.  The  two  team   members  have  been  dismissed  and  there  are  felony  warrants  out  for  their  arrests.   The  store  has  been  shut  down  and  sanitized  from  top  to  bottom.     There  is  nothing  more  important  or  sacred  to  us  than  our  customers  trust.  We  are   re-examining  all  of  our  hiring  practices  to  make  that  people  like  this  don't  make  it   into  our  stores.  We  have  auditors  across  the  country  in  our  stores  everyday  of  the   week,  making  sure  that  our  stores  are  as  clean  as  they  can  possibly  be  and  that  we   are  delivering  high  quality  food  to  our  customers  day  in  and  day  out.  The   independent  owner  of  that  store  is  reeling  from  the  damage  that  this  has  caused  and   it  is  not  a  surprise  that  this  has  caused  a  lot  of  damage  to  our  brand.     It  sickens  me  that  the  actions  of  two  individuals  could  impact  our  great  system,   where  125  000  men  and  women  work  for  local  business  owners  around  the  US  and   more  than  60  countries  around  the  world.  We  take  tremendous  pride  in  crafting   delicious  food  that  they  deliver  to  you  every  day.  There  are  so  many  people  who   have  come  forward  with  messages  of  support  for  us  and  we  want  to  thank  you  for   hanging  in  there  with  us  as  we  work  to  regain  your  trust.                                    70  

  

Appendix  E   Toyota  USA  (2010)   Hi,  I'm  Jim  Lentz,  president  of  Toyota  Motor  Sales  USA.  I  want  to  let  you  know  that   we  have  developed  a  comprehensive  plan  to  fix  the  sticking  pedal  situation  in   recalled  Toyota  vehicles.      But  first,  I  want  to  sincerely  apologize  to  Toyota  owners.      I  know  that  our  recalls  have  caused  many  of  you  concern...  and  for  that  ...  I  am  truly   sorry.      Toyota  has  always  prided  itself  on  building  high  quality,  durable  cars  that  customers   can  depend  on...and  I  know  that  we  have  let  you  down.  I  want  you  to  know  that  all   172,000-plus  Toyota  and  dealership  employees  across  North  America  will  work   hard  to  fix  your  vehicle  properly  and  regain  your  trust.      In  fact,  many  of  our  dealers  will  have  extended  hours  and  some  will  remain  open  24   hours  a  day  to  get  this  job  done.      And  we're  redoubling  our  efforts  to  ensure  this  does  not  happen  again.      The  fix  can  be  completed  within  a  short  period  of  time,  depending  on  the  work  flow   at  your  dealership.      We  hope  to  start  making  those  repairs  in  just  a  few  days.  Owners  will  be  notified  by   mail  when  to  set  up  a  dealer  appointment.      In  addition,  our  dealers  have  already  started  fixing  the  earlier-announced  floor  mat   recall  vehicles.  We  are  doing  this  as  quickly  as  possible,  and  we  ask  that  you  wait  to   contact  your  dealer  when  you  receive  our  letter  in  the  mail.      Some  Toyota  vehicles  are  involved  in  both  recalls...  and  we  hope  to  coordinate  your   notification  so  you  can  take  care  of  both  repairs  in  one  dealer  visit.      For  more  details,  including  a  list  of  the  vehicles  involved  in  these  recalls,  please  visit   Toyota.com  or  call  the  Toyota  Customer  Experience  Center      Once  again  I  apologize  for  this  situation...and  I  hope  you  will  give  us  a  chance  to  earn   back  your  trust.        Thank  you  for  your  patience  and  understanding.            71  

Appendix  F   BP  Oil  (2010)   The  gulf  spill  is  a  tragedy  that  never  should  have  happened.  I'm  Tony  Hayward.  BP   has  taken  full  responsibility  for  cleaning  up  the  spill  in  the  gulf.  We've  helped   organize  the  largest  environmental  response  in  this  country's  history.  More  than  2   million  feet  of  boom,  30  planes,  and  over  1,300  boats  are  working  to  protect  the   shoreline.  Where  oil  reaches  the  shore,  thousands  of  people  are  ready  to  clean  it  up.   We  will  honor  all  legitimate  claims,  and  our  clean  up  efforts  will  not  come  at  any   cost  to  taxpayers.     To  those  affected  and  your  families,  I'm  deeply  sorry.  The  gulf  is  home  for  thousands   of  BP  employees  and  we  all  feel  the  impact.  To  all  the  volunteers  and  for  the  strong   support  of  the  government,  thank  you.  We  know  it  is  our  responsibility  to  keep  you   informed  and  do  everything  we  can  so  this  never  happens  again.  We  will  get  this   done.  We  will  make  this  right.                                                      72  

  

Appendix  G   FedEx  (2011)   Along  with  many  of  you,  I've  seen  the  video  showing  one  of  our  couriers,  on  behalf   of  all  of  us  at  FedEx  please  accept  our  apology.  I  am  upset  and  embarrassed  for  our   customer's  poor  experience.  This  goes  directly  against  all  FedEx  values.  It's  just  not   who  we  are.  We  were  determined  to  make  this  right  and  I  am  very  pleased  that  we   were  able  to  met  with  our  customer  who  has  accepted  our  apology.  We  have   resolved  the  issue  and  the  customer  is  satisfied.        Many  of  you  want  to  know  what  is  happening  to  the  employee,  we  take  this  matter   very  seriously,  while  we  consider  employee  information  private  I  can  assure  you  we   are  working  with  our  disciplinary  policy  and  the  employee  is  not  working  with   customers,  the  most  disappointing  thing  about  this  incident  for  me  is:  It  absolutely   not  represent  our  290,000  professional  dedicated  team  members  world  wide.  Our   FedEx  motto  is  simply:  I  will  make  every  FedEx  experience  outstanding.

Appendix  H   Research  In  Motion  (2011)   Hi,  I'm  Mike  Lazaridis.     Since  launching  BlackBerry  in  1999,  it's  been  my  goal  to  provide  reliable  real-time   communications  around  the  world.  We  did  not  deliver  on  that  goal  this  week.  Not   even  close.  I  apologize  for  the  service  outages  this  week.  We've  let  many  of  you   down.  But  let  me  assure  you  that  we're  working  round  the  clock  to  fix  this.  You   expect  better  from  us,  and  I  expect  better  from  us.     It's  too  soon  to  say  this  issue  is  fully  resolved.  But  let  me  give  you  more  detail  about   what's  happening.  We're  now  approaching  normal  BlackBerry  service  levels  in   Europe,  the  Middle  East,  India  and  Africa.  We  continue  to  monitor  the  system  very   closely.  We're  working  very  hard  to  continue  to  stabilize  the  system,  and  we're   seeing  steady  improvements.  We  expect  to  see  continued  progress,  and  possibly   some  instability,  as  the  system  comes  back  to  normal  service  levels  everywhere.  We   know  that  you  want  to  hear  more  from  us,  and  we're  working  to  update  you  more   frequently  through  our  websites  and  social  media  channels  as  we  gather  more   information.  I'd  like  to  give  you  an  estimated  time  of  full  recovery  around  the  world   ­  but  I  cannot  do  this  with  certainty  at  this  time.     For  those  of  you  affected,  I  know  this  is  very  frustrating.  We're  doing  everything  in   our  power  to  restore  regular  service  levels,  and  we're  working  tirelessly  to  restore   your  trust  in  us.  We'll  update  you  again  soon.  Thank  you.                                       74  

  

Appendix  I   Alaska  Airlines  (2011)   B:  Hi  everyone,  I'm  Brad  Tilden.   G:  And  I'm  Glen  Johnson.   B:  We're  here  to  talk  with  you  about  a  problem  with  our  computer  systems,  which   has  seriously  affected  our  operations  today.  Early  this  morning,  while  a  back  up   power  supply  system  was  being  installed,  a  transformer  blew  and  took  down  the   central  computer  system  for  both  Alaska  and  Horizon.  This  system  is  used  to   prepare  flight  plans  among  other  functions.   G:  As  a  result,  both  Alaska  and  Horizon  have  been  forced  to  cancel  a  number  of   flights,  disrupting  the  travel  plans  of  our  customers.  In  addition,  many  flights  have   been  delayed  by  two  hours  or  more;  and  unfortunately  more  delays  are  expected   throughout  the  Alaska-Horizon  route  system  today.   B:  And  as  of  mid-day,  the  two  airlines  have  combined  to  cancel  around  140  flights.   G:  And  unfortunately,  these  cancellations  have  affected  nearly  12,000  of  our   passengers.   B:  Our  IT  crews  have  been  working  non-stop  to  fix  the  issue  and  we're  operating  on   backup  systems  now.  We're  working  to  get  as  many  of  our  customers  as  possible  on   their  way  s  quickly  as  we  can.   G:  In  the  meantime,  we  are  advising  all  of  our  customers  to  check  the  status  of  their   flight  before  leaving  for  the  airport  either  by  visiting  alaskaair.com  or  by  calling  1- 800-alaskaair.   B:  We  know  you  count  on  us  to  meet  our  flight  schedule  so  you  can  make  it  to  your   commitments,  whether  it  is  a  family  gathering,  an  important  business  obligation  or  a   spring  break  trip.  That's  a  responsibility  that  we  don't  take  lightly  and  we're  very   sorry  for  preventing  you  from  getting  to  your  destination  on  time.   G:  Our  airport  representatives  and  reservations  agents  are  re-booking  customers  at   no  charge  on  other  flights,  and  we're  also  working  to  accommodate  them  on  other   airlines  if  necessary.  In  addition,  we're  adding  extra  Horizon  flights  as  needed   throughout  the  day.   B:  If  you  are  among  those  customers  who  have  been  affected,  we  encourage  you  to   contact  our  customer  care  team  after  you  have  been  re-accommodated.  Our   representatives  are  working  diligently  to  respond  to  every  customer  and  we  will   make  this  right  for  you.

G:  On  behalf  of  the  13,000  employees  of  Alaska  Airlines  and  Horizon  Air,  please,   accept  our  sincere  apologies  for  any  disruption  to  your  travel  plans  and  also,  our   tanks  for  your  patience  and  understanding.   B:  We  look  forward  to  the  opportunity  to  welcome  you  on  one  of  our  flights  again   soon.                                                                        76
