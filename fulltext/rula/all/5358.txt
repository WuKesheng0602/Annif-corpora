A Case Study in Open Access, Creative Commons, and Predatory Publishing

Predatory publishing: what does that mean?
1. Beall's list of OA journals that charge APCs (article processing fees), engage in dubious publication practices according to Beall's criteria 2. Predatory Conferences which take advantage of the researcher's need to present at conferences. Invite researchers to conferences that charge high registration fees, which appear to be more prestigious and topical than they actually are 3. Republishing or reselling work intended by its authors to be available for free. "Our best bet is to avoid predatory publishers, including those not on Beall's list...that knowingly or carelessly resells work that was intended by its authors to be available for free. It may be legal, but it isn't right." Barbara Fister, `New Predatory Publishing in Old Bottles' https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/new-predatory-publishing-old-bottles

The article

The discovery
1. ORCID and Google Scholar: awareness around author profiles 2. Discovery that an article from Partnership had been re-published in a book

Original Article

McIntosh J. Library and Information Science: Parameters and Perspectives. Apple Academic Press; 2011. (paperback edition, April 2016).
(ISBN: 9781926692746; ISBN-13: 978-1926692746)

The investigation
1. We checked the current Partnership CC licenses, and it was a non-commercial CC license (see below) 2. Spoke to our Copyright Librarian 3. Outrage!

The investigation continues...
Discovered the `attributions' - below is an example, which was buried at the back of the book, with no links to the original. Attribution to our paper: "17. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License" p. 303. The above attribution references a different licence than the one we believed was in place for the journal. Also, the above may not be a proper attribution. (see: Best Practices for Attribution).

Lemons, Lemonade, and Lawyers
1. Pitched OLA presentation idea 2. Decided to embark on a thorough investigation of how this happened, with the goal of others learning through our experiences 3. Contacted Legal Counsel

Editors & Authors
1. Emailed journal editor regarding CC licensing, etc. and phone conversation a. Discovered that the license had changed a number of times from a noncommercial to commercial and back to noncommercial over the journal's existence b. Difficult to determine which license was originally attached to our article 2. Contacted book editor, and had email correspondence. a. Other authors had contacted her to express concern b. She had ceased her association with the press c. She was provided with articles and asked to write an introduction

Author feedback
- - Contacted other authors from the book, sent brief survey and provided an option to speak with us. Scheduled two conversations with interested authors to get more insightful feedback.

Results 1. 2. 3. 4. Only one author knew that this/her article had been republished Three were aware of the CC licence terms All five would have preferred to have been asked Range of responses include outrage, futile acceptance, and encouragement

Some author comments
"Seems like this publisher was looking for free content and was making money out of open access..." "I'm sure limited profits are made from these kinds of titles, but asking permission is a reasonable thing for a publisher to do in these circumstances." "I am ambivalent. On the one hand, I would prefer the content not be used in a commercial publication and particularly not one produced by a publisher of very dubious quality. On the other, I accept that there are consequences to the licenses we sign and I understand that this is part of that." "Not sure because it is better to have the original cited and having now found it on Google books...I see it makes NO mention of the origin or attribution..." "If someone were to take an idea from my article, and use it to invent something new and then commercialize it, I don't distinguish between that happening, and the creation of this book."

1) 2) 3) A Rant on Strawberries, Open Access Licenses, and the Reuse of Published Papers ( https://schadtlab.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/a-rant-on-strawberries-open-access-licenses-and-the-reuse-of-published-papers/) Apple Academic Press: Predatory publisher of scholarly books ( http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2013/07/apple-academic-press-predatory.html) Apple Academic Press (https://scholarlyca.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/apple-academic-press/)

"So it seems that the entire business model of Apple Academic Press is to harvest two-to-four-year-old open-access papers from PubMed Central, change their titles, and republish them at $100 per volume without drawing attention to the original sources -- either not mentioning them at all, or hiding the citations in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying `Beware of the Leopard`."

Quote: "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
"But the plans were on display..." "On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them." "That's the display department." "With a flashlight." "Ah, well, the lights had probably gone." "So had the stairs." "But look, you found the notice, didn't you?" "Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying `Beware of the Leopard."

Take aways
1. When submitting articles for publication, examine and understand the terms of the license and know that CC licenses are irrevocable 2. Use ORCID and run regular updates 3. Many shades of gray in predatory publishing

More questions than answers...
How strongly do we value open culture? What are we willing to consider as collateral damage to support and encourage open access scholarship? Should we reconsider purchasing publications from publishers that engage in these practices? Is academic freedom under assault when journals dictate the terms of reuse rather than authors?
