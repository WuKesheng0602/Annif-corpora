ABSTRACT     
This  case  study  examines  the  creative  use  of  narrative  in  sermons  within  the  United   Methodist  Church  in  light  of  the  rapid  decline  in  Christian  church  attendance.  Using   narrative  theory,  the  study  reviews  sermons  by  John  Wesley  and  the  pastors  of   Granger  Community  Church  for  use  of  narrative  patterns,  mimesis,  and  diegesis.   This  study  shows  that  both  groups  used  narrative  extensively  but  for  different   purposes.  John  Wesley  employs  narrative  to  shed  light  on  the  biblical  text  and  to   encourage  his  congregants'  adherence  to  the  principles  outlined  in  the  Bible.  The   pastors  of  Granger  Community  Church  use  narrative  to  create  interest  in  the   sermon's  message  and  to  establish  a  personal  connection  with  congregants.  Despite   their  different  techniques,  both  John  Wesley  and  Granger  Community  Church   showcase  innovation  with  their  use  of  narrative  in  sermons.

INTRODUCTION  
The  evangelical  church  today  has  over  38,000  denominations  (World  Christian   Encyclopedia,  1982)  and  many  different  styles  of  worship  services.  While  their   practices  may  be  different,  churches  of  all  Christian  denominations  have   experienced  a  rapid  decline  in  attendance  over  the  past  few  decades.  In  1945,  60%   of  the  Canadian  population  attended  weekly  church  services.  In  the  1950s,  church   attendance  rose  to  about  70%  of  the  population  attending  church  regularly.   However,  by  1975,  church  attendance  had  decreased  to  30%.  In  2000,  the  rate  was   20%  (Coggins,  2007).  In  Western  Europe,  only  10%  of  the  population  attend   services  and  it  is  expected  that  church  attendance  rates  in  Canada  will  soon  reflect   this  statistic.  Some  experts  even  predict  that  the  Christian  religion  will  no  longer   exist  in  Europe  by  2040  (The  Independent,  2000).  One  reason  for  this  decline  is  that   people  who  have  grown  up  in  the  church  are  quickly  abandoning  the  tradition.   About  80%  of  this  group  cease  to  attend  church  in  early  adulthood  and  never  return   (Coggins,  2007).  Some  researchers  point  to  increased  immigration  as  the  reason  for   declining  church  attendance  rates  in  Canada.  They  theorize  that  since  there  are   increasing  numbers  of  immigrants  to  Canada  who  are  from  other  religious   backgrounds,  this  influx  affects  the  rate  of  Christian  observance  in  Canada  (Coggins,   2008).  However,  immigrants  to  Canada  are  much  more  likely  to  attend  church  than   native-born  Canadians  (Couto,  2011).  It  is  undeniable  that  church  attendance  is   sinking,  especially  among  people  born  in  Canada  and  people  who  grew  up  going  to   church.

This  shrinking  church  attendance  calls  for  a  review  of  all  aspects  of  a   church's  activities.  One  of  these  key  areas  is  the  sermon.  A  sermon  is  "the   transmission  of  theological  ideas"  (Herman  &  Mooij,  2010)  and  is  usually  the  heart   of  a  church's  service.  Typically,  a  pastor  or  other  speaker  will  choose  a  passage  from   the  Bible  and  expound  on  its  interpretation  and  application  to  Christian  living.  The   sermon  often  sets  the  tone  for  the  entire  service.  Many  churches  choose  songs  and   responsive  readings  that  reflect  the  sermon  topic.  As  the  main  part  of  a  church   service,  if  the  sermon  fails  to  captivate  listeners  or  be  memorable,  it  is  unlikely  that   other  activities  within  the  church  will  be  enough  to  secure  a  congregant's   permanent  attendance.        Research  shows  that  only  one-third  of  congregants  retain  the  core  message  

of  a  sermon  (Hermans  &  Mooij,  2010).  Some  pastors  use  creative  tactics  to  increase   interest  in  and  memory  of  the  sermon  (Hermans  &  Mooij,  2010).  Narrative  is  one  of   the  methods  that  can  be  applied  to  sermon  rhetoric  to  aid  congregants  in  retention   of  the  sermon  topic  (Whitehouse,  2004  cited  in  Hermans  &  Mooij,  2010).  Narratives   and  stories  are  used  in  everyday  conversation  and  help  people  to  understand  and   relate  to  one  another  (Fisher,  1984).  In  the  same  way,  pastors  employ  narrative  to   substantiate  a  point  and  increase  the  persuasiveness  of  their  sermons  (Hermans  &   Mooij,  2010).  These  narratives  within  sermons  can  inspire  change  in  listeners,   whether  the  change  affects  an  attitude  or  an  entire  lifestyle  (Merriam  &  Caffarell,   1999  cited  in  Carrell,  2009).

PURPOSE  OF  THIS  STUDY   The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  research  how  narrative  has  historically  been  utilized   in  effective  sermons  and  determine  if  the  same  pattern  exists  now.  To  complete  this   study,  I  reviewed  two  sets  of  sermons  within  the  United  Methodist  tradition.  Both   sets  of  sermons  are  from  churches  with  rapidly  growing  congregations  within  the   United  Methodist  denomination.     The  study  of  creative  elements  such  as  narrative  within  sermons  is  important   in  today's  church  environment.  Church  attendance  is  on  a  rapid  decline.  Across   Canada,  church  attendance  in  each  province  and  territory  varies  widely.  The  only   common  trend  is  that  all  provinces  have  seen  a  decline  in  weekly  church  attendance   since  1993  (Clark,  2003).  There  are  many  theories  of  why  church  attendance  in  the   western  world  is  declining  so  rapidly.  One  is  that  today's  generation  feels  that   churches  are  out  of  touch  and  irrelevant  (Greene,  1998  cited  in  Jenkins  &  Cavan,   2009).  While  our  culture  has  quickly  changed  and  given  rise  to  postmodernism,   many  pastors  have  refused  to  adapt  their  methods.    Non-attendees  also  cite  lack  of   time  and  that  they  disagree  with  the  church's  stances  on  ethical  or  political  issues   (Barrick,  2007).  Even  for  people  who  attend  church  regularly,  they  report  that   services  are  boring  and  the  content  is  not  applicable  to  everyday  living  (Sparks,   2005).  In  order  to  have  sermon  content  be  relevant  for  everyday  life,  it  needs  to  be   accessible  and  memorable.  The  comprehension  of  a  story  involves  many  different   memory  processes,  meaning  that  a  story  and  its  lessons  can  often  be  recalled  for  the   long  term  (Kim,  1999).

I  chose  to  study  the  use  of  narrative  in  the  United  Methodist  tradition.  John   Wesley,  the  founder  of  the  Methodist  tradition,  preached  thousands  of  sermons  in   his  lifetime  and  was  a  well-known  evangelist.  Over  two  hundred  years  later,  the   pastors  of  Granger  Community  Church  follow  his  example  with  passionate   preaching  and  evangelism.        In  studying  the  sermons  of  John  Wesley  and  of  Granger  Community  Church  

pastors,  I  considered  the  following  questions:  1)  How  did  John  Wesley  use  narrative   in  his  messages?  2)  What  forms  does  narrative  take  in  the  messages  at  Granger   Community  Church?  and  3)  Is  narrative  the  same  in  the  sermons  of  John  Wesley  and   the  messages  by  the  pastors  of  Granger  Community  Church?  How  is  it  different?   Through  my  research,  I  found  that  the  use  of  narrative  has  always  been  an   important  factor  in  these  sermons,  but  for  very  different  purposes.  Wesley  limits  the   use  of  narrative  in  his  messages,  usually  using  stories  only  to  reflect  back  on  his   biblical  text.  The  pastors  at  Granger  Community  Church,  on  the  other  hand,  use   narrative  extensively  to  illustrate  points  and  vary  the  content  of  their  sermons.   Thus,  a  comparison  of  the  two  proves  the  effectiveness  of  narrative  to  strengthen   sermons  while  also  revealing  different  methods  for  the  application  of  narrative.        

INTRODUCTION  TO  JOHN  WESLEY   The  first  set  of  sermons  studied  is  from  Methodist  founder  John  Wesley.  Wesley   (1703  ­  1791)  was  an  Anglican  priest,  evangelical  preacher  and  theologian   (Christian  Classics  Ethereal  Library,  2011).  After  a  spiritual  conversion  experience   in  1738,  Wesley  spent  the  rest  of  his  life  as  an  evangelist,  preaching  over  40,000  

  

4  

sermons  (Oakes,  2004).  John  Wesley,  along  with  his  brother  Charles  Wesley,  was   part  of  a  group  of  young  men  at  Oxford  University  seeking  spiritual  growth   (Christian  Classics  Ethereal  Library,  2011).  Collectively,  they  were  known  as  the   Methodists  and  spearheaded  a  spiritual  paradigm  shift  across  England.  The   movement  focused  on  evangelicalism  and  also  the  need  for  the  church  to  serve  less   fortunate  members  of  society  (Methodist  Central  Hall  Westminster,  2011).  After   Wesley's  death,  the  Methodist  movement  separated  from  the  Anglican   denomination.  The  new  denomination  was  called  Methodism.1     There  are  many  different  denominational  sectors  within  Methodism.  Two   such  denominations  were  the  Evangelical  United  Brethren  Church  and  the   Methodist  Church.  On  April  24,  1968,  the  two  denominations  were  joined  as  one   when  Bishop  Rueben  H.  Mueller  of  the  Evangelical  United  Brethren  Church  and   Bishop  Lloyd  C.  Wicke  of  the  Methodist  Church  united  the  two  denominations  with   the  prayer,  "Lord  of  the  Church,  we  are  united  in  Thee,  in  Thy  Church  and  now  in  the   United  Methodist  Church"  (United  Methodist  Church,  2008).  The  United  Methodist   Church  now  has  over  eleven  million  members  around  the  world  (ibid).     

                                                                                                                 1  There  are  now  70  million  Methodist  members  globally.  Methodism  focuses  on  the   importance  of  meeting  together  for  Bible  study,  prayer  and  Holy  Communion.  The   denomination  also  places  high  importance  on  reaching  out  to  underprivileged   members  of  society.  The  four  aims  of  Methodism  are  as  follows:  "1)  To  increase   awareness  of  God's  presence  and  to  celebrate  God's  love,  2)  To  help  people  to  grow   and  learn  as  Christians  through  mutual  support  and  care,  3)  To  be  a  good  neighbour   to  people  in  need  and  to  challenge  injustice,  and  4)  To  make  more  followers  of  Jesus   Christ"  (Methodist  Central  Hall  Westminster,  2011).      5  

INTRODUCTION  TO  GRANGER  COMMUNITY  CHURCH     One  of  the  largest  churches  under  the  United  Methodist  Church  denomination  today   is  Granger  Community  Church  in  Granger,  Indiana.  Granger  Community  Church  is   the  source  of  the  second  set  of  analyzed  sermons.     Founder  and  senior  pastor  Mark  Beeson  began  the  church  out  of  his  living   room  in  1986.  Ten  people  attended  the  first  service.  Twenty-five  years  later,   Granger  Community  Church  has  a  congregation  numbering  5,000  at  its  main  campus   in  Granger  (Shafer,  personal  communication,  2011).  The  church  also  has  a   congregation  of  four  hundred  in  Elkhart,  Indiana,  a  gathering  of  one  hundred  at  a   community  centre  in  Monroe  Circle,  Indiana  and  over  twenty  at  a  local  prison   (Granger  Community  Church,  2011).  The  church  now  has  sixty-nine  employees,   including  five  pastors  who  share  preaching  responsibilities  (ibid).

LITERATURE  REVIEW  
Pastors'  use  of  narrative  in  sermons  is  a  natural  extension  of  everyday  conversation.   Alasdair  MacIntyre  wrote  that,  "man  is  in  his  actions  and  practice,  as  well  as  in  his   fictions,  essentially  a  story-telling  animal"  (MacIntyre,  1981).  A  theorist  who  was   greatly  influenced  by  MacIntyre  was  Walter  Fisher.  Fisher  describes  narration  as  "a   theory  of  symbolic  actions  ­  words  and/or  deeds  ­  that  have  sequence  and  meaning   for  those  who  live,  create  or  interpret  them"  (Fisher,  1984,  p.2).  Fisher  writes  that   narrative  theory  can  apply  to  both  real  and  fictitious  situations.  He  suggests  that   narratives  are  powerful  and  form  people's  perception  of  the  world.  To  create  this   foundation,  narratives  compete  with  one  another,  and  people  select  those  they   believe  will  form  a  foundation  in  their  lives.  Fisher  also  points  out  the  importance  of   using  narratives  in  religious  rhetoric.  He  cites  Goldberg's  claim  that,     A  theologian,  regardless  of  the  propositional  statements  he  or  she  may  have   to  make  about  a  community's  convictions,  must  consciously  and  continually   strive  to  keep  those  statements  in  intimate  contact  with  the  narratives  which   gave  rise  to  those  convictions,  within  which  they  gain  their  sense  and   meaning,  and  from  which  they  have  been  abstracted.  (Goldberg,  1982  cited  in   Fisher,  1984,    p.  3).        This  quote  from  Goldberg  reinforces  Fisher's  point  that  narratives  can  form  a   foundation  in  people's  lives  and,  as  a  result,  be  a  very  powerful  tool.  Fisher  also  uses   Goldberg's  work  to  assert  that  narratives  can  help  seemingly  disconnected  points   and  theology  to  flow  together  for  easy  comprehension.  He  includes  the  following   quote  from  Goldberg:     Neither  the  facts,  nor  our  experience,  come  to  us  in  discrete  and   disconnected  packets  which  simply  await  the  moral  principal  to  be  applied.   Rather,  they  stand  in  need  of  some  narrative  which  can  bind  the  facts  of  our   experience  together  into  a  coherent  pattern  and  it  is  thus  in  virtue  of  that  

  

7  

  

narrative  that  our  abstracted  rules,  principles  and  notions  gain  their  full   intelligibility  (Goldberg,  1982  cited  in  Fisher,  1984,  p.3).  

In  order  for  sermons  to  be  noteworthy  and  inspire  change  in  listeners'  lives,  they   must  be  memorable  and  also  have  points  that  will  challenge  previously  held   viewpoints.  Fisher's  argument  is  that  this  goal  is  best  accomplished  through   narrative.  He  also  contends  that  application  of  narrative  can  be  used  in  any  setting  ­   from  personal  conversations  to  professional  workplaces.  He  points  out  that  the   lasting  impact  of  the  Bible  can  be  partly  credited  to  narrative  and  quotes  Hauerwas   that,  "The  social  significance  of  the  Gospel  requires  recognition  of  the  narrative   structure  of  Christian  convictions  for  the  life  of  the  church"  (Hauerwas,  1981  cited   in  Fisher,  1984,  p.3).   Michael  Kearns,  another  researcher  in  narrative  theory,  asserts  that  in  order   for  narrative  to  truly  take  shape,  the  act  of  speech  is  needed  (Kearns,  1999).  In  the   case  of  narratives  in  sermon  rhetoric,  Kearns'  theory  is  that  the  narrative  is  only   given  meaning  when  interpreted  by  the  members  of  the  congregation  since  all   narration  is  subject  to  the  final  audience.  Stories  do  not  have  a  prescribed  meaning   with  the  same  effect  on  every  person.  With  this  view,  Kearns  is  reflective  of  reader- response  theory.   A  key  theorist  in  reader-response  theory  is  Louise  Rosenblatt.  In  The  Reader,   The  Text,  The  Poem:  The  Transactional  Theory  of  the  Literary  Work,  Rosenblatt   suggests  that  narrative  is  subject  to  interpretation  and  transactions  between  people.   She  writes,  "Each  reader  brings  to  the  transaction  not  only  a  specific  past  life  and   literary  history,  not  only  a  repertory  of  internalized  `codes,'  but  also  a  very  active  

  

8  

present,  with  all  its  preoccupations,  anxieties,  questions,  and  aspirations"   (Rosenblatt,  1978  cited  in  Davis  and  Womack,  2002,  p.  55).    Rosenblatt's  idea  that  a   text's  interpretation  depends  on  its  audience's  background  is  one  of  the  most   important  facets  of  reader-response  theory.  Since  each  person  experiences   narrative  with  a  different  history  and  background,  a  varied  transaction  will  result.   This  idea  certainly  applies  to  congregants'  individual  interpretations  of  sermons.   The  importance  of  sermons  being  interpreted  and  understood  is  illustrated   in  Carrell's  "Communication  training  for  clergy:  Exploring  impact  on  the   transformative  quality  of  sermon  communication".  Carrell  writes  that  47%  of   Americans  report  that  they  listen  to  at  least  one  sermon  every  week.  This  group   includes  people  who  attend  a  church  service,  experience  a  sermon  through  CD  or   DVD,  or  access  a  sermon  online  (Barna  Research  Group,  2007  cited  in  Carrell,  2009).   Also,  about  44  million  people  in  the  United  States  are  members  of  one  of  the  twenty- five  largest  Christian  denominations  (Lindner,  2007  cited  in  Carrell,  2009).  With   such  a  large  audience,  it  is  vital  that  church  leaders  and  pastors  are  communicating   effectively  to  their  congregations.        Pastors'  use  of  narrative  in  sermons  will  fall  into  one  of  the  two  categories  

within  narrative,  mimesis  and  diegesis.  Mimesis  refers  to  showing  a  story  by  setting   a  scene  and  thus  suggests  that  the  narrative  "evokes  reality  by  staging  it"  (Herman  &   Vervaeck,  p.  14,  2005).  Mimesis  usually  includes  a  very  literal  portrayal  of  a   situation,  often  including  direct  quotes  from  participants.  A  narrative  that  is  told   using  mimesis  will  contain  extensive  dialogue  and  action  (Herman  &  Vervaeck,   2005).  The  narrator  of  the  story  becomes  secondary  since  the  characters  within  the  

  

9  

narrative  are  presented  with  detail  and  direct  quotes.  Instead  of  the  narrator   guiding  the  story,  he  or  she  tells  the  story  through  the  characters'  interactions   (Schaeffer  &  Vultur,  2005).  First  person  narration  is  sometimes  an  example  of   mimesis  since  the  narrator  is  telling  an  autobiographical  story  about  an  event  that   occurred  in  the  past.  This  earlier  self  becomes  one  of  the  characters  in  the  narrative   (Jahn,  2005).   On  the  other  hand,  diegesis  summarizes  events  and  interactions  and  the   narrator's  voice  is  always  evident  (Herman  &  Vervaeck,  2005).  As  opposed  to   mimesis  being  a  portrayal  of  the  story,  diegesis  is  characterized  by  indirect   presentation  or  summary  and  is  referred  to  as  "the  level  above  the  primary  story"   (Shen,  p.  107,  2005).  In  diegesis,  the  narrator's  voice  presents  a  "world  which  is  not   his  own"  (Berger,  p.  411,  1994).  While  the  audience's  attention  still  focuses  on  the   world  created  by  the  narrator,  they  are  always  aware  that  narrator  is  framing  the   story  for  them,  rather  than  immersing  them  in  the  characters'  interactions  as  is  the   case  with  mimesis  (ibid).     These  sources  shaped  how  I  reviewed  the  sermons  for  applications  of   narrative  and  what  methods  I  used  in  my  study  of  sermons  within  the  United   Methodist  tradition.

To  study  narrative  within  the  United  Methodist  tradition,  I  selected  representative   samples  of  sermons  from  John  Wesley  and  Granger  Community  Church.  In  order  to   include  a  variety  of  content,  I  reviewed  five  of  John  Wesley's  sermons  and  five   sermons  from  Granger  Community  Church.  The  sermons  selected  form  five   comparative  pairs.  For  each  pair,  there  is  one  sermon  from  John  Wesley  and  one   from  Granger  Community  Church.  Both  sermons  are  based  on  the  same  passage   from  the  Bible,  the  holy  book  of  Christianity.        Both  Wesley  and  Granger  Community  Church  preach  sermons  with  the  aim  

to  declare  that  Jesus  Christ  is  the  only  way  to  salvation.2  The  sermons  also  provide   instruction  on  how  to  live  a  Christian  life  following  salvation.  I  chose  to  focus  only   on  sermons  based  on  passages  from  the  New  Testament  that  dealt  with  these   matters  within  the  early  church.3  To  find  sermons  for  analysis,  I  first  looked  at   Granger  Community  Church's  video  archives  and  made  note  of  what  passages  the   sermons  were  based  on.  I  then  reviewed  archives  of  Wesley's  sermons  to  determine   if  he  had  preached  a  sermon  based  on  the  same  passage.  

                                                                                                                 2  In  the  New  Testament,  salvation  is  "specially  used  with  reference  to  the  great   deliverance  from  the  guilt  and  the  pollution  of  sin  wrought  out  by  Jesus  Christ,  the   great  salvation"  (Easton's  Bible  Dictionary,  2010).     3  The  early  church  was  a  group  of  people  who  professed  Jesus  Christ  as  the  Messiah   and  only  source  of  salvation.  The  early  church  was  led  by  Jesus'  disciples.  The  term   "early  church"  usually  covers  from  the  time  of  Jesus'  resurrection  (29  AD)  to  325  AD.      11

      Transcripts  of  John  Wesley's  sermons  are  widely  available  in  various  

collections.  For  my  review,  I  retrieved  five  transcripts  from  the  Global  Ministries  of   the  United  Methodist  Church  website  (www.new.gbgm-umc.org).        Granger  Community  Church  posts  both  video  and  audio  versions  of  all  

sermons  on  the  church  website  (www.gccwired.com).  The  five  selected  sermons   were  transcribed  for  review.      The  sermons  sets  are  based  on  Acts  4,  2  Corinthians  3,  Ephesians  6,  

Colossians  and  1  Peter  3.  Acts  4  is  part  of  the  story  of  the  foundation  of  the  early   church  in  about  29  AD.  The  book  is  the  continuation  of  Jesus'  ministry,  carried  out   by  his  disciples  as  they  proclaim  Jesus  Christ  to  be  the  fulfillment  of  prophecies   about  the  Messiah.  2  Corinthians,  Ephesians,  and  Colossians  were  written  by  the   apostle  Paul.  Earlier  in  his  life,  Paul  had  been  a  persecutor  of  Christians  until  he   surrendered  his  life  to  Christ.4  He  became  committed  to  building  the  church  and  

                                                                                                                 4  Acts  9:1-18      12  

sharing  the  message  of  the  Gospel.5  Over  the  course  of  his  life,  he  completed  three   missionary  journeys  and  was  imprisoned  twice  for  preaching  the  Gospel  (Witmer,   1983).  During  his  life,  Paul  wrote  many  letters  to  churches  that  he  had  encountered   during  his  ministry.  These  letters,  or  epistles,  contain  encouragement,  correction   and  instruction  for  holy  Christian  living.  2  Corinthians,  Ephesians  and  Colossians  are   three  of  the  thirteen  biblical  epistles  authored  by  Paul  (Witmer,  1983).  1  Peter  was   written  by  Simon  Peter,  one  of  Jesus'  disciples.  Peter  is  described  in  Acts  4  as  a   passionate  preacher  of  the  Gospel.  Peter  wrote  to  instruct  Christians  but  his  letter  in   1  Peter  takes  a  very  different  tone  than  that  of  Paul's  letters.  Peter  was  writing  to   Christians  undergoing  persecution  for  their  faith,  giving  them  advice  but  most  of  all   encouragement  (Raymer,  1983).        · · All  sermons  were  studied  for  the  following  elements:   Narrative  patterns   Differences  between  Wesley's  narratives  and  those  of  the  pastors  of  Granger   Community  church   · · Mimesis   Diegesis

The  term  can  also  be  applied  to  the  central  belief  in  Christianity  that   Jesus  Christ  was  the  Messiah  and  the  only  source  of  salvation.      13  

ANALYSIS:  SERMONS  BASED  ON  ACTS  4  
The  first  set  of  sermons  analyzed  is  based  on  Acts  4  in  the  New  Testament.  The  book   of  Acts  details  the  life  of  the  church  following  the  death  and  resurrection  of  Christ.   Throughout  his  ministry,  Jesus  Christ  worked  with  and  mentored  twelve  disciples.6   Following  his  death  and  resurrection,  Christ  continued  to  guide  the  disciples  for   forty  days.  He  reassured  them  that  he  would  send  the  Holy  Spirit  to  guide  `and   instruct  them  as  they  endeavoured  to  share  the  Gospel  with  the  world.  After  Christ   ascended  into  heaven,  his  disciples  met  together  to  pray  and  wait  for  the  Holy   Spirit's  arrival.  This  waiting  period  is  where  the  book  of  Acts  begins.  The  Holy   Spirit's  coming  is  recorded  in  Acts  2.        Acts  4  describes  disciples  Peter  and  John's  activities  immediately  following  

the  Holy  Spirit's  arrival.  The  Holy  Spirit  empowered  Peter  and  John  to  boldly  preach   the  message  of  the  Gospel  in  Jerusalem.  They  were  so  bold  in  their  preaching  that   listeners  questioned  if  the  men  were  drunk  (Acts  2:13).  The  Holy  Spirit  also  enabled   the  men  to  speak  in  other  languages  so  that  all  hearers  could  understand  their   message  (Acts  2:6).  In  addition,  the  disciples  performed  many  miracles  (Acts  2:43).   As  a  result  of  their  preaching  and  of  miraculous  signs,  Peter,  John  and  the  other   disciples  attracted  large  crowds.  

                                                                                                                 6  "These  are  the  twelve  he  appointed:  Simon  (to  whom  he  gave  the  name  Peter),   James  son  of  Zebedee  and  his  brother  John  (to  them  he  gave  the  name  Boanerges,   which  means  "sons  of  thunder"),  Andrew,  Philip,  Bartholomew,  Matthew,  Thomas,   James  son  of  Alphaeus,  Thaddaeus,  Simon  the  Zealot  and  Judas  Iscariot,  who   betrayed  him"  (Mark  3:16-19).      14  

The  priests,  temple  guard  and  Sadducees7  became  alarmed  at  the  disciples'   preaching  of  Christ's  death  and  resurrection  (Acts  4:1-2).  Peter,  John  and  the  other   disciples  were  fully  aware  of  the  dangers  of  preaching  the  message  of  Jesus  Christ   but  continued  to  proclaim  it  anyway  (Acts  4:20).  As  a  result,  they  were  imprisoned   overnight  (Acts  4:3).  When  questioned  before  a  group  of  political  and  religious   authorities  the  next  day,  the  Holy  Spirit  once  again  gave  Peter  boldness  to  share  the   Gospel  message  (Acts  4:5-8).  Peter  proclaimed  that  "Jesus  is  `the  stone  you  builders   rejected,  which  has  become  the  cornerstone.'  Salvation  is  found  in  no  one  else,  for   there  is  no  other  name  under  heaven  given  to  mankind  by  which  we  must  be  saved"   (Acts  4:11-12,  New  International  Version).   In  1744,  John  Wesley  preached  a  sermon  based  on  this  passage  entitled   "Scriptural  Christianity".  The  United  Methodist  denomination's  transcript  of   Wesley's  sermon  is  seven  pages  (approximately  7000  words  in  total).  Wesley   spends  two-thirds  of  his  sermon  explaining  the  biblical  text  and  its  context.  He   discusses  the  impacts  of  the  Holy  Spirit's  arrival  on  the  early  church,  particularly   with  the  spiritual  gifts  of  love,  joy,  peace,  long-suffering,  gentleness  and  goodness.        Wesley  also  notes  that  the  Holy  Spirit's  arrival  meant  rapid  growth  in  the  

Church's  numbers.  Immediately  after  the  Holy  Spirit  descended  on  Christ's   followers,  the  apostle  Peter  began  to  preach  in  the  street.  Hearing  Peter's  message,   many  people  repented  of  their  sins  and  committed  their  lives  to  Christ.  These  new   Christians  became  known  for  their  sense  of  community,  care  for  the  poor  and   unwavering  devotion  to  Christ.  As  these  new  Christians  continued  to  spread  the                                                                                                                    7  Religious  leaders      15  

message  of  Christ,  the  church  grew  rapidly.  Acts  4:4  records  that  even  after  Peter   and  John  were  imprisoned,  about  5,000  people  heard  the  Gospel  message  and   believed  Jesus  Christ  to  be  the  Messiah.      Wesley's  challenge  to  listeners  of  this  sermon  revolves  around  the  state  of  

Christianity  in  1744.  Wesley  urges  his  congregation  to  follow  the  example  of  the   early  church  in  the  areas  of  love,  service  and  evangelism.  Just  as  the  Church  of  29  AD   prayed  and  spent  time  together,  Wesley  stresses  that  his  congregation  should  also   be  strong  in  their  commitment  to  one  another.  Wesley  encourages  his  congregants,   "I  entreat  you  to  observe,  that  here  are  no  peculiar  notions  now  under   consideration;  that  the  question  moved  is  not  concerning  doubtful  opinions  of  one   kind  or  another,  but  concerning  the  undoubted,  fundamental  branches  (if  there  be   any  such)  of  our  common  Christianity"  (Wesley,  1744).  Most  importantly,  Wesley   questions  if  the  Christians  of  his  day  are  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit  as  are  the   members  of  the  early  church  in  Acts  4:   Where  does  this  Christianity  now  exist?  Where,  I  pray,  do  the  Christians  live?   Which  is  the  country,  the  inhabitants  whereof  are  all  thus  filled  with  the  Holy   Ghost?  --are  all  of  one  heart  and  of  one  soul?  Cannot  suffer  one  among  them   to  lack  anything,  but  continually  give  to  every  man  as  he  hath  need;  who,  one   and  all,  have  the  love  of  God  filling  their  hearts,  and  constraining  them  to  love   their  neighbour  as  themselves;  who  have  all  "put  on  bowels  of  mercy,   humbleness  of  mind,  gentleness,  long-suffering?"  Who  offend  not  in  any  kind,   either  by  word  or  deed,  against  justice,  mercy,  or  truth;  but  in  every  point  do   unto  all  men;  as  they  would  these  should  do  unto  them?  With  what  propriety   can  we  term  any  a  Christian  country,  which  does  not  answer  this   description?  Why  then,  let  us  confess  we  have  never  yet  seen  a  Christian   country  upon  earth...  Brethren,  "I  am  persuaded  better  things  of  you,  though   I  thus  speak."  Let  me  ask  you  then,  in  tender  love,  and  in  the  spirit  of   meekness,  Is  this  city  a  Christian  city?  Is  Christianity,  scriptural  Christianity,   found  here?  Are  we,  considered  as  a  community  of  men,  so  "filled  with  the   Holy  Ghost,"  as  to  enjoy  in  our  hearts,  and  show  forth  in  our  lives,  the   genuine  fruits  of  that  Spirit?  (Wesley,  1744).      16  

     

In  "Scriptural  Christianity",  Wesley's  use  of  narrative  is  interspersed   throughout  his  message.  However,  instead  of  using  his  own  examples,  his   illustrations  are  all  directly  from  the  Bible.  Wesley  opts  to  use  diegesis  for  his   narratives,  remaining  a  constant  voice  in  the  telling  of  the  stories.        Wesley  opens  his  sermon  with  a  narrative  about  a  person's  first  experiences  

after  converting  to  the  Christian  faith.  Instead  of  creating  the  story  with  his  own   insights,  Wesley  describes  the  individual  through  scriptural  references:   And,  first,  let  us  consider  Christianity  in  its  rise,  as  beginning  to  exist  in   individuals.  Suppose,  then,  one  of  those  who  heard  the  Apostle  Peter  preaching   repentance  and  remission  of  sins,  was  pricked  to  the  heart,  was  convinced  of   sin,  repented,  and  then  believed  in  Jesus.  By  this  faith  of  the  operation  of  God,   which  was  the  very  substance,  or  subsistence,  of  things  hoped  for  (Heb.  11:1,)   the  demonstrative  evidence  of  invisible  things,  he  instantly  received  the  Spirit   of  adoption,  whereby  he  now  cried,  "Abba,  Father"  (Rom.  8:15).  Now  first  it   was  that  he  could  call  Jesus  Lord,  by  the  Holy  Ghost  (1  Cor.  12:3),  the  Spirit   itself  bearing  witness  with  his  spirit,  that  he  was  a  child  of  God  (Rom.  8:16).   Now  it  was  that  he  could  truly  say,  "I  live  not,  but  Christ  liveth  in  me;  and  the   life  which  I  now  live  in  the  flesh,  I  live  by  faith  in  the  Son  of  God,  who  loved  me,   and  gave  himself  for  me"  (Gal.  2:20).  (Wesley,  1744)      This  point  in  the  sermon  is  an  example  of  diegesis  because  Wesley  describes  

  

the  life  of  a  believer  but  does  not  enter  into  the  story  with  creative  dialogue  or   detail.  Instead,  it  is  a  summary  using  biblical  text  as  support  through  references  to   Hebrews  11:1,  Romans  8:15-16,  1  Corinthians  12:3,  and  Galatians  2:20.      Wesley's  narrative  includes  several  tools  to  increase  his  audience's  

involvement  in  the  story.  As  he  begins  the  narrative,  Wesley  invites  his  listeners  into   the  story  with  the  phrase  "let  us  consider".  This  phrasing  gives  the  impression  that   Wesley  wants  his  audience  to  experience  the  story  along  with  him.  He  also  uses  this   tactic  when  he  invites  his  congregants  to  "suppose"  the  reaction  of  the  person  who   decides  to  put  his  or  her  faith  in  Jesus  Christ  as  Messiah.        17  

  

Wesley  also  includes  his  audience  by  including  references  that  they  would  

most  likely  be  familiar  with.  For  example,  Wesley  describes  the  Christian  faith  as  the   "the  very  substance,  or  sustenance,  of  things  hoped  for".  This  expression  comes   from  Hebrew  1:1  and  would  be  familiar  to  a  churchgoing  audience.        Wesley  also  keeps  his  audience's  attention  with  creative  descriptions  of  the  

new  believer's  emotions.  For  example,  rather  than  simply  citing  his  subject  as  being   convicted  of  sin,  Wesley  instead  says  that  he  is  "pricked  to  the  heart".  This  imagery   is  a  method  to  showcase  feeling  and  vividness  without  using  rich  dialogue  as  found   in  mimesis.        Wesley  also  creates  interest  with  his  description  of  the  new  believer's  

relationship  with  God.  Instead  of  simply  mentioning  that  the  new  Christian  prayed,   Wesley  suggests  that,  instead,  the  new  believer  cried  out  with  "Abba,  Father".  This   inclusion  implies  the  love  that  the  new  believer  has  for  God  since  "Abba"  is  the   Hebrew  word  for  "Daddy".  This  phrase  would  conjure  comfortable  images  of  a   father  and  child  for  listeners  and  give  further  insight  into  the  feelings  of  the  new   believer.   Wesley  continues  "Scriptural  Christianity"  with  descriptions  of  how   members  of  the  Church  were  transformed  through  their  worship,  fellowship  and   learning  of  Christ's  work.  He  concludes  this  first  section  of  his  sermon  with  this   narrative:   Such  was  Christianity  in  its  rise.  Such  was  a  Christian  in  ancient  days.  Such   was  every  one  of  those  who,  when  they  heard  the  threatenings  of  the  chief   priests  and  elders,  "lifted  up  their  voice  to  God  with  one  accord,  and  were  all   filled  with  the  Holy  Ghost.  The  multitude  of  them  that  believed  were  of  one   heart  and  of  one  soul:"  So  did  the  love  of  him  in  whom  they  had  believed   constrain  them  to  love  one  another!  "Neither  said  any  of  them  that  aught  of      18  

the  things  which  he  possessed  was  his  own  but  they  had  all  things  common:"   So  fully  were  they  crucified  to  the  world,  and  the  world  crucified  to  them!   "And  they  continued  steadfastly  with  one  accord  in  the  Apostles"  doctrine,   and  in  the  breaking  of  bread,  and  in  prayers"  (Acts  2:42).  "And  great  grace   was  upon  them  all;  neither  was  there  any  among  them  that  lacked:  for  as   many  as  were  possessors  of  lands  or  houses  sold  them,  and  brought  the   prices  of  the  things  that  were  sold,  and  laid  them  down  at  the  Apostles'  feet:   And  distribution  was  made  unto  every  man  according  as  he  had  need"  (Acts   4:31-35).  (Wesley,  1744)         Wesley  opens  the  narrative  with  several  sentences  that  begin  with  "Such  was".  This   repetition  effectively  summarizes  Wesley's  earlier  points  about  the  growth  of  the   early  Christian  church,  characteristics  of  the  first  Christians  and  the  threats  that   people  in  the  early  church  lived  with  daily.  The  repetition  is  also  used  for  Wesley  to   capture  his  congregants'  interest  and  draw  their  attention  to  the  unity  displayed  by   the  early  church  that  he  wants  them  to  emulate.  Reading  the  transcript,  one  can   almost  hear  Wesley's  voice  rising  with  excitement  as  he  proclaims  each  "such  was"   statement.      Since  part  of  Wesley's  challenge  to  his  congregants  was  to  display  the  kind  of  

love  the  members  of  the  early  church  showed  for  one  another,  he  makes  a  point  of   including  specific  instances  such  as  sharing  possessions,  having  all  things  in   common,  eating  together,  praying  for  and  with  one  another,  and  helping  those  in   need.      Wesley  again  uses  descriptive  words  and  phrases  in  this  narrative  to  make  

the  story  memorable.  For  example,  Wesley  notes  that  the  members  of  the  early   church  were  discouraged  by  the  chief  priests  and  elders  from  speaking  about  Christ.   Instead  of  merely  mentioning  this  fact,  Wesley  uses  the  word  "threatenings"  to   describe  the  extent  to  which  the  authorities  tried  to  intimidate  the  early  church.

Wesley's  word  choice  of  "threatenings"  to  describe  the  chief  priests  and  elders'   warnings  also  stands  in  stark  contrast  to  the  early  Christians'  response.  Instead  of   displaying  fear  over  the  warnings  not  to  preach  the  Gospel,  the  members  of  the  early   church  made  a  practice  of  praising  God  together.  Wesley  notes  that  the  members  of   the  early  church  "lifted  up  their  voice  to  God  with  one  accord,  and  were  all  filled   with  the  Holy  Ghost"  (Wesley,  1744).  Wesley  highlights  the  contrast  between  the   "threatenings"  of  the  religious  leaders  and  the  early  church's  response  by  placing   these  descriptions  close  together.  The  early  Christians'  reaction  to  the  dangers  of   following  Christ  showcases  their  strong  faith  and  confidence  in  God.      One  of  the  most  effective  word  choices  in  Wesley's  narrative  comes  when  he  

describes  how  the  church  should  be  separated  from  the  world.  He  notes  of  the  early   church,  "So  fully  were  they  crucified  to  the  world,  and  the  world  crucified  to  them!"   (Wesley,  1744).  Wesley  shows  the  stark  difference  between  the  church  and  the   secular  world  by  using  "crucified",  a  common  means  of  capital  punishment  at  the   time  of  the  early  church.  Wesley's  audience  would  also  understand  that  this  verb   choice  also  referenced  how  Christ  died.  Since  Christ's  death  and  resurrection  is  at   the  heart  of  Christians'  salvation  message,  Wesley's  use  of  this  word  is  very   effective.  Not  only  is  he  encouraging  listeners  to  be  separated  from  secularity,   Wesley  is  encouraging  them  to  become  more  like  Christ.   Wesley  uses  a  similar  pattern  of  diegesis  when  describing  Peter  and  John's   efforts  in  sharing  the  Gospel  message  and  their  subsequent  arrest.  Instead  of   delivering  the  story  with  paraphrased  dialogue  and  action,  Wesley  summarizes  the   passage  from  Acts  4  by  using  various  passages  from  the  Bible  for  insight.  

  

20  

And  (the  apostles')  labor  was  not  in  vain  in  the  Lord.  His  word  ran  and  was   glorified.  It  grew  mightily  and  prevailed.  But  so  much  the  more  did  offences   prevail  also.  The  world  in  general  were  offended,  "because  they  testified  of  it,   that  the  works  thereof  were  evil"  (John  7:7).  The  men  of  pleasure  were   offended,  not  only  because  these  men  were  made,  as  it  were,  to  reprove  their   thoughts  ("He  professeth,"  said  they,  "to  have  the  knowledge  of  God;  he  calleth   himself  the  child  of  the  Lord,  his  life  is  not  like  other  men's;  his  ways  are  of   another  fashion;  he  abstaineth  from  our  ways,  as  from  filthiness;  he  maketh  his   boast,  that  God  is  his  Father"  Wis.  2:13-16;)  but  much  more,  because  so  many   of  their  companions  were  taken  away,  and  would  no  more  run  with  them  to   "the  same  excess  of  riot."  (1  Pet.  4:4.)  The  men  of  reputation  were  offended,   because,  as  the  gospel  spread,  they  declined  in  the  esteem  of  the  people;  and   because  many  no  longer  dared  to  give  them  flattering  titles,  or  to  pay  man  the   homage  due  to  God  only.  The  men  of  trade  called  one  another  together,  and   said,  "Sirs,  ye  know  that  by  this  craft  we  have  our  wealth:  but  ye  see  and  hear   that  these  men  have  persuaded  and  turned  away  much  people;  so  that  this  our   craft  is  in  danger  to  be  set  at  nought"  (Acts  19:25ff).  Above  all,  the  men  of   religion,  so  called,  the  men  of  outside  religion,  "the  saints  of  the  world,"  were   offended,  and  ready  at  every  opportunity  to  cry  out,  "Men  of  Israel,  help!  We   have  found  these  men  pestilent  fellows,  movers  of  sedition  throughout  the   world"  (Acts  24:5).  "These  are  the  men  that  teach  all  men  everywhere  against   the  people,  and  against  this  place"  (Acts  21:28).                       Thus  it  was  that  the  heavens  grew  black  with  clouds,  and  the  storm   gathered  again.  For  the  more  Christianity  spread,  the  more  hurt  was  done,  in   the  account  of  those  who  received  it  not;  and  the  number  increased  of  those   who  were  more  and  more  enraged  at  these  "men  who  thus  turned  the  world   upside  down;"  (Acts  17:6)  insomuch  that  more  and  more  cried  out,  "Away  with   such  fellows  from  the  earth;  it  is  not  fit  that  they  should  live;"  yea,  and   sincerely  believed,  that  whosoever  should  kill  them  would  do  God  service   (Wesley,  1744).      Wesley  repeats  previous  patterns  of  using  rich  descriptions  in  his  diegesis.  First,   Wesley  describes  the  rampant  growth  of  the  Gospel,  "And  (the  apostles')  labor  was   not  in  vain  in  the  Lord.  His  word  ran  and  was  glorified.  It  grew  mightily  and   prevailed"  (Wesley,  1744).  In  this  instance,  Wesley  applies  action  verbs  to  describe   growth  in  the  church.  The  use  of  "the  word"  is  also  another  instance  of  Wesley   including  references  that  would  be  familiar  for  a  church  audience.  In  John  1,  Jesus   Christ  is  described:  "The  Word  became  flesh  and  made  his  dwelling  among  us.  We   have  seen  his  glory,  the  glory  of  the  one  and  only  Son,  who  came  from  the  Father,      21  

full  of  grace  and  truth"  (John  1:14).  Wesley's  use  of  the  term  "the  word"  reflects  the   fact  that  the  message  of  the  Gospel  is  rooted  in  Jesus  Christ.        Wesley  also  uses  action  verbs  to  describe  the  offences  that  were  being  

carried  out  against  the  members  of  the  early  church.  Wesley  says  that  the  offences   prevailed  and  then  goes  on  to  direct  examples  from  the  Bible  of  how  people  became   offended  at  the  message  of  the  disciples.     Although  Wesley  uses  summary  in  the  narrative,  he  makes  sure  to  captivate   his  audience  with  descriptions  like  "the  heavens  grew  black  with  clouds,  and  the   storm  gathered  again".  This  rich  imagery  is  a  stylistic  device  to  captivate  his   audience  and  provide  some  context,  even  without  using  the  immersion  techniques   that  would  be  found  in  a  story  told  with  mimesis.  This  description  also  emphasizes   that  although  Acts  4  describes  the  early  church's  rampant  growth  and  fellowship,   they  also  experienced  hurt,  persecution  and  anger  from  the  secular  world.   Mark  Beeson  of  Granger  Community  Church  uses  a  very  different  strategy   with  his  use  of  narrative  in  his  message  based  on  Acts  4  entitled  "Picture  This,  Part   One".  Beeson's  theme  in  the  sermon  is  following  Christ  wholeheartedly  and  he   encourages  congregants  to  visualize  what  such  a  life  would  look  like.  Beeson  enlists   his  sermon  title,  "Picture  This",  in  his  opening  comments,        Well,  picture  this.  People  of  the  world  in  turmoil  and  strife  and  difficulty,   facing  heartache,  hungry,  wounded,  feeling  all  alone.  People  wondering  if   there's  any  help  or  any  hope  discover  that  God  Almighty  has  not  left  them  to   despair....  Picture  this:  that  God  would  come  in  His  own  Son  Jesus  Christ,  that   God  would  take  on  flesh,  Emmanuel,  God  with  us  and  that  God  would  dwell   among  us...  Picture  this:  that  anyone  who  trusts  Christ,  that  anyone  who   comes  to  Him,  anyone  who  turns  from  a  life  of  selfishness  and  sin  and   decides  to  submit  to  Christ  and  His  kingdom  cannot  only  have  life  and   forgiveness  forever  but  peace  and  joy  and  hope...      Picture  this:  that  you  are      22  

called  right  now  to  make  what  may  be  the  most  important  decision  that   you've  ever  made  and  it  is  simply  that  you  submit  your  life  to  the  King  of   Kings  and  Lord  of  Lords  (Beeson,  2011).      Beeson  outlines  what  submission  to  Christ  means  in  the  daily  life  of  a   Christian.  He  then  acknowledges  the  hesitancy  of  submitting  to  Christ  and  uses  a   narrative  to  illustrate.  He  also  ties  in  the  title  of  the  sermon  "Picture  This"  with  this   example,   You  may  say,  "I'm  not  sure  about  this  Jesus,  I  don't  know  that  I  know  Jesus.   I've  heard  his  name  mentioned  but  usually  it's  not  in  praise.  I've  had  some   friends  name  his  name  but  I  don't  think  they  were  thankful  for  anything,  they   were  just  mad.  So  this  Jesus,  I  don't  know  him,  I  don't  know  God,  I  don't  know   what  God  even  looks  like,  why  would  I  give  my  future  to  God  if  I  can't  even   picture  him?"     Well  it's  like  the  little  boy  who  was  furiously  drawing  at  home  and  as   he  was  scribbling  away  with  his  crayons,  his  mother  couldn't  help  but  ask,   "What  are  you  drawing?"  He  didn't  even  look  up  but  with  more  energy,  he   drew  and  drew  and  he  said  "God!  I'm  drawing  God!".  And  his  mother  said,   "Oh  honey,  no  one  knows  what  God  looks  like."  He  just  kept  drawing.  "Not  yet   they  don't,"  he  said.   Wouldn't  it  be  something  if  people  could  see  the  love  of  God  in  your   life?  Picture  this:  a  life  well  lived,  a  life  that  has  such  significance  and  purpose   that  adds  so  much  value  that  the  world  sits  up  and  says,  "this  is  a  picture  of   the  kingdom  of  God."  Picture  a  life  like  that  (Beeson,  2011).      This  opening  narrative  is  an  example  of  Beeson's  use  of  mimesis.  He  first   enters  into  the  story  from  the  perspective  of  his  listeners,  crafting  a  creative  inner   dialogue.  Similar  to  Wesley,  Beeson  is  trying  to  showcase  the  heart  and  thoughts  of  a   person  new  to  the  Christian  faith.  In  Beeson's  case,  he  includes  the  inner  turmoil   that  can  make  a  new  believer  question  or  doubt  their  decision  to  follow  Christ.   Beeson  also  ties  in  the  title  with  the  question,  "Why  would  I  give  my  future  to  God  if   I  can't  even  picture  him?"    

  

23  

The  mimesis  continues  with  the  example  of  the  little  boy  who  is  drawing  a   picture  of  God.  Beeson  stages  the  story  with  description  and  dialogue  between  a   mother  and  her  son.  Although  the  story  is  short,  Beeson  completely  envelops  his   audience  in  it.  He  describes  the  little  boy  as  "furiously  drawing"  and  "scribbling"   over  his  artwork.  Immediately,  the  audience  can  picture  the  scene.  Beeson  takes  the   image  further  with  the  conversation  between  the  boy  and  his  mother.  By  setting  up   the  scene  so  well,  the  audience  can  practically  hear  the  little  boy  proclaiming,  "God!   I'm  drawing  God!"  and  his  smug  comment  that  everyone  will  know  what  God  looks   like  once  his  drawing  is  complete.  The  story  also  evokes  thoughts  of  a  cozy   relationship  between  a  boy  and  his  mother.  In  this  way,  it  is  reflective  of  Wesley's   use  of  "Abba"  in  "Scriptural  Chrisitianity  to  depict  a  comfortable  relationship   between  God  and  a  new  believer.   Beeson  goes  on  to  use  extensive  narrative  as  he  continues  with  his  sermon.   He  relies  heavily  on  mimesis,  using  personal  stories  and  examples  from  his  own  life   to  support  his  points.  After  reading  Acts  4  directly  from  the  Bible,  Beeson  uses  the   following  story  to  frame  his  sermon  and  its  application  points:         You  may  know  that  about  a  year  ago  I  traveled  to  Egypt.  I  had  the   opportunity  to  go  with  some  friends  from  Granger  Community  Church   and  travel  the  route  of  the  Exodus.  It  was  a  great  experience  for  me.     Of  course,  preparing  to  go,  it  seemed  right  that  I  should  read  and   study  all  about  Egypt.  So  I  read  everything!  I  read  books  by  historians,  I  read   archeologists,  I  read  religious  leaders  and  tried  to  glean  their  thoughts  about   Egypt.  I  read  about  history,  the  past,  the  present  and  what  some  called  the   future  of  Egypt  and  I  knew  about  Egypt.  I  knew  everything  there  was  to  know   about  Egypt!     Have  you  ever  felt  like  that?  Have  you  ever  read  a  book  about   marriage  before  you  got  married  only  to  discover  that  shortly  after  you  got   married,  that  the  book  somehow  was  incomplete?  You  read  it,  you   understood  it,  you  thought  you  were  ready  and  somehow,  about  two  years  

  

24  

into  your  marriage,  you're  like,  "NEW  INFORMATION!  THIS  WASN'T  CLEAR   IN  THE  BOOK!"   I  read  all  the  books  and  went  to  Egypt.  I  knew  all  about  Egypt  from  the   books  I'd  read  and  I  arrived  there  in  Cairo  and  I  met  Izad.  Izad  was  a   Christian  ­  still  is!  ­  he  lives  in  Cairo  and  we  spent  several  days  with  Izad  and   he  would  teach  us  and  train  us  and  guide  us  and  show  us  the  various  places.   The  more  I  listened  to  him,  the  more  impressed  I  was  with  his  knowledge.  It   seemed  that  he  knew  everything  about  Egypt,  things  that  I  had  never   understood.  Finally  I  asked  him,  "Izad!  How  is  it  that  you  know  so  much   about  Egypt?"  And  he  looked  at  me  and  said,  "Well,  I've  lived  here  all  my  life."      How  many  of  you  know  that  there  are  more  ways  of  learning  than   studying  in  books?  Book  learning  is  in  fact  a  poor  substitute  for  first-hand   experience  (Beeson,  2011).      This  story  is  an  example  of  mimesis.  By  describing  this  past  event,  Beeson   reflects  Jahn's  statement  that  one's  past  self  can  become  a  character  in  mimesis.   Beeson  provides  background  detail  of  his  reading  in  preparation  for  his  trip  to  Egypt   and  also  includes  dialogue.  Through  his  narrative,  Beeson's  audience  captures  a   very  clear  idea  of  his  preparation  for  the  trip  and  some  of  his  experiences  with  his   Egyptian  host,  Izad.  It  is  also  through  his  host  that  Beeson  realizes  there's  a  gap   between  his  knowledge  and  that  of  Izad.  Flabbergasted  by  Izad's  extensive   knowledge,  Beeson  questions  him  about  where  he  learned  all  of  the  facts  he's  been   sharing  with  the  group.  Izad's  reply  of  "I've  lived  here  all  my  life"  allows  the   audience  to  enter  further  into  the  study  but  also  lends  itself  to  Beeson's  point.  He   suggests  that  there  is  a  world  of  difference  between  book  learning  and  experience.   He  maintains  that  a  relationship  with  Christ  is  no  exception.  Beeson  encourages  his   audience  to  truly  know  Christ  and  build  a  relationship  with  him,  not  simply  rely  on   second-hand  knowledge  of  others.   Beeson  then  discusses  the  parallel  of  Izad's  comment  with  the  experience  of   Peter  and  John.  While  Peter  and  John  were  not  educated  scholars,  they  had  spent      25  

three  years  with  Jesus.  Their  first-hand  experience  was  what  allowed  them  to  speak   so  boldly,  even  when  confronted  and  threatened.  Beeson  explains  the  commonality   in  this  narrative:   The  truth  is,  if  you  really  want  to  get  inside  a  subject  or  you  really  want  a   subject  to  get  inside  of  you,  you  may  need  to  live  with  it,  live  in  it.  That's  what   was  so  striking  about  Peter  and  John.  There's  no  doubt  in  that  day,  in  that   community,  that  rabble-rousers  of  some  sort  or  another  had  been  dragged   before  the  Sanhedrin  on  a  number  of  occasions.  The  truth  is,  most  of  those   folks,  troublemakers  in  general,  probably  had  nothing  to  say  when   confronted  directly.  But  Peter  and  John  were  different.  They  clearly  had  not   been  through  a  Levitical  school  to  study  the  scriptures.  In  that  Judean  society,   people  knew  who  the  up  and  coming  bright  young  students  were  who  were   going  to  be  Rabbis.  These  guys  were  just  not  that  type.  They  were  untrained,   they  were  ordinary  men.  Now  they  had  just  made  shrewd  use  of  one  of  the   Psalms,  something  you  might  expect  of  someone  who  had  been  to  class  and   had  studied  in  the  Levitical  schools  and  studied  different  interpretations  of   the  scriptures  ­  but  they  hadn't  been  to  the  Levitical  schools!  Like  Izad  who   had  lived  in  Egypt  and  knew  Egypt  well,  they  knew  a  secret  and  that  secret   allowed  them  to  run  circles  around  some  of  the  book  learning  that  they  were   facing.  You  see,  the  difference  was  they  had  lived  with  Jesus  (Beeson,  2011)      Like  Wesley's  analysis  of  the  biblical  text,  Beeson's  is  also  characterized  by   diegesis.  He  summarizes  the  story  of  Peter  and  John  in  Acts  4  and  provides  good   detail  but  doesn't  use  direct  quotes.  His  own  voice  is  evident  and  this  is  a   predominant  feature  in  diegetic  narratives  (Shen,  2005).  It  is  important  that  Beeson   take  on  the  role  of  the  narrator  at  this  point  in  the  sermon.  In  order  to  drive   conviction  into  his  audience  and  have  the  challenge  be  memorable,  he  needs  to  have   his  audience's  confidence.  By  telling  the  biblical  narrative  himself  instead  of  having   the  characters  at  the  forefront,  Beeson  can  easily  intersperse  his  own  insights  such   as,  "The  truth  is,  most  of  those  folks,  troublemakers  in  general,  probably  had  nothing   to  say  when  confronted  directly.  But  Peter  and  John  were  different...  In  that  Judean   society,  people  knew  who  the  up  and  coming  bright  young  students  were  who  were      26  

going  to  be  Rabbis.  These  guys  were  just  not  that  type"  (Beeson,  2011).  By   establishing  his  credibility,  Beeson  captures  his  audience's  confidence  and  trust  and   he  positions  himself  to  challenge  his  congregation.    Beeson's  use  of  diegesis  also   allows  him  to  build  a  relationship  with  his  audience.  He  uses  down-to-earth   language  and  has  an  approachable  style  with  his  interpretation  of  the  text.        As  his  sermon  continues,  Beeson  uses  a  combination  of  personal  examples  

and  biblical  text.  In  this  example,  he  describes  his  own  experience  of  driving  in  a   snowstorm.  With  extensive  detail  of  his  own  feelings  and  surroundings,  Beeson  uses   mimesis  to  describe  the  situation.  He  then  continues  to  use  mimesis  in  restaging  the   biblical  text  and  paraphrasing  Peter:   Not  too  long  ago,  we  had  a  huge  snowstorm.  I  was  crazy  and  decided  to  drive   in  it.  Snow  everywhere,  whiteout,  it  was  just  fantastic!  Drifts  and  everything   cancelled  and  snow  and  wind!  I  went  out  to  the  little  shed  by  our  house  to  get   some  things  to  bring  into  the  house.  Howling,  blowing  wind  was  taking  the   shed  door  back  and  forth  and  I  reached  out  to  grab  it.  I  wasn't  wearing  any   gloves  ­  fourteen  below  zero,  thirty  mile  an  hour  wind  ­  why  would  I  wear   gloves?  I'm  a  man!  My  hand  stuck  to  the  door  and  the  howling  wind  is   blowing  the  door  back  and  I'm  trying  to  close  the  door.  Have  you  ever  tried  to   close  the  door  on  a  howling  wind?  How  are  you  going  to  close  that  up?  How   are  you  going  to  keep  that  wind  from  blasting  it  open?     I  tell  you,  that's  how  those  folks  in  the  Sanhedrin  must  have  felt.  Think   about  it  ­  anyone  who  has  found  any  name  that  will  enable  sick  people  to  be   healed  is  very  unlikely  to  stop  using  the  name  no  matter  what  the  authorities   say  ­  and  even  if  they  forbid  it.  So  Peter  answers  them  in  a  way  that's  not  just   pragmatic  but  the  truth  is,  his  answer  is  theological.  It  forms  the  basis  of  all   Christian  resistance  to  the  powers  of  this  world  from  that  day  to  this.  Peter   says,  "You're  the  judges  around  here?  Very  well  then!  Give  me  your  legal   judgment.  Render  your  opinion  on  this  one!  If  we're  standing  here  in  the   presence  of  Almighty  God,  should  we  then  obey  God  or  should  we  obey  you?   Judge  that!"  And  of  course,  Peter  then  answers  his  own  question  and  says,   "You  can  answer  any  way  you  like  but  as  for  me  and  my  friends,  we  are  not   going  to  stop  speaking  the  name  of  Jesus.  And  we  won't  stop  talking  about   what  God  has  done  through  Him.  You're  not  able  to  close  this  door"  (Beeson,   2011).     

  

  

27  

Despite  the  lightheartedness  of  his  narratives,  Beeson's  application  point  returns  to   submission  to  Christ.  He  speaks  passionately  about  a  vibrant  relationship  with   Christ  but  points  back  to  the  disciples'  experience  to  point  out  that  following  him   can  be  costly  and  lead  to  trials.  His  final  use  of  narrative  in  this  message  is  an   example  of  a  difficult  circumstance  taken  from  current  events:   A  photographer  in  Egypt  took  these  pictures  yesterday.  These  are  pictures  of   Christians  holding  hands  and  facing  outward  ­  their  hands  joined  in  a  circle   to  protect  their  neighbors  and  friends  in  Cairo  from  their  attackers.  They   have  joined  their  hands  and  they  are  standing  between  their  Muslim   neighbors  as  they  pray  and  those  who  would  do  them  harm.  I  see  this  and  I   think,  "Naming  the  name  of  Jesus  is  a  costly  thing  isn't  it?"  And  I  look  at  it  and   I  think,  "Where  would  I  be?  What  would  I  do?  What  am  I  doing?"  Seeing  the   image,  it's  like  I  am  invited  into  the  reality  of  the  turmoil  to  stand  one  way  or   another  and  I've  been  asking  myself,  "Where  will  I  stand?  Where  do  I  stand?   And  how  will  I  stand?  How  do  I  do  it?"  (Beeson,  2011).      This  narrative  is  an  example  of  diegesis.  Beeson's  description  of  the  events  in  Egypt   is  from  an  outside  perspective.  Beeson  summarizes  the  situation  and  therefore   applies  diegesis.  He  establishes  distance  immediately  with  the  narrative's  opening   sentence,  "A  photographer  in  Egypt  took  these  pictures  yesterday."  The  distance  is   important  because  the  point  of  the  sermon  is  not  to  think  about  the  political   situation  in  Egypt.  Beeson  wants  his  audience  to  focus  on  their  own  lives  and  on   Beeson's  encouragement  to  live  wholeheartedly  for  Christ.  At  the  end  of  this   narrative,  Beeson  adds  his  own  insight  and  involves  the  audience  in  the  moment   when  he  saw  these  images  for  the  first  time.  He  reveals  his  own  inner  dialogue  but   remains  a  dominant  narrator  in  the  story.  He  also  emphasizes  his  point  with  the   questions,  "Where  will  I  stand?  Where  do  I  stand?  And  how  will  I  stand?  How  do  I  do   it?"  (Beeson,  2011).  These  questions  are  ones  that  Beeson  has  posed  to  himself  but   indirectly,  he  is  asking  them  of  his  congregation  through  this  story.      28  

  

Both  Wesley  and  Beeson  use  significant  narrative  to  preach  on  the  events  

portrayed  in  Acts  4.  While  Wesley  focuses  only  on  biblical  narratives  and  Beeson   uses  a  combination  of  biblical  and  current  stories,  they  reinforce  Fisher's  view  that   narration  can  add  meaning  for  an  audience.  In  these  sermons,  Beeson  and  Wesley   use  narrative  to  substantiate  the  claims  and  application  points  made  in  their   sermons.      Beeson  and  Wesley  use  many  examples  of  Peter  and  John  throughout  their  

respective  sermons.  Their  extended  use  and  retelling  of  the  biblical  narrative  reflect   Hauerwas's  assertion  that  the  church  must  embrace  the  "narrative  structure  of   Christian  convictions"  in  order  to  be  effective.  By  retelling  a  familiar  biblical   narrative  with  new  detail,  both  pastors  raise  new  points  and  use  the  narratives  as  a   platform  to  encourage  their  congregations  to  live  wholeheartedly  for  Christ.

ANALYSIS:  SERMONS  BASED  ON  2  CORINTHIANS  3  
The  sermons  in  the  second  pair  are  derived  from  2  Corinthians  3.  2  Corinthians  is  a   letter  from  the  apostle  Paul  to  members  of  the  early  church  in  Corinth.  His  letter   contains  some  continuations  of  the  themes  within  1  Corinthians  but  is  also  a  defense   of  his  leadership  of  the  church.  After  his  first  letter,  the  church  in  Corinth  questioned   Paul's  authority  and  accused  him  of  inconsistencies  and  skewed  motives  (Peterson,   2002).  In  this  particular  chapter,  Paul  writes  of  the  ultimate  authority,  the  Holy   Spirit,  and  the  freedoms  that  are  granted  to  all  Christians  through  him.  In  particular,   Christians  are  able  to  approach  God  with  their  prayers  and  requests  freely  without   use  of  a  high  priest  because  of  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit's  intercession.8      John  Wesley's  sermon  based  on  this  passage  is  entitled  "On  the  Holy  Spirit"  

and  it  was  preached  at  St.  Mary's,  Oxford  in  1736.  Since  the  passage  is  a  letter  of   guidance  and  instruction  from  Paul,  Wesley's  style  in  presenting  his  sermon  is  very   different  than  in  "Scriptural  Christianity"  where  his  reference  contained  a  story.   Wesley's  narratives  in  this  sermon  take  the  form  of  biblical  examples  illustrating  the   Holy  Spirit's  presence.        Wesley  opens  his  sermon  with  a  reference  to  the  apostles'  work,  one  example  

of  which  is  contained  in  Wesley's  "Scriptural  Christianity"  sermon.  This  narrative   also  gives  an  account  of  Christ  and  Wesley  again  takes  his  descriptions  from  biblical   references.                                                                                                                    8  "In  the  same  way,  the  Spirit  helps  us  in  our  weakness.  We  do  not  know  what  we   ought  to  pray  for,  but  the  Spirit  himself  intercedes  for  us  through  wordless  groans.   And  he  who  searches  our  hearts  knows  the  mind  of  the  Spirit,  because  the  Spirit   intercedes  for  God's  people  in  accordance  with  the  will  of  God"  (Romans  8:26-27).      30  

  

The  Apostle  had  been  showing  how  the  gospel  ministry  was  superior  to  that  of   the  law:  The  time  being  now  come  when  types  and  shadows  should  be  laid   aside,  and  we  should  be  invited  to  our  duty  by  the  manly  and  ingenuous   motives  of  a  clear  and  full  revelation,  open  and  free  on  God's  part,  and  not  at   all  disguised  by  his  ambassadors.  But  what  he  chiefly  insists  upon  is,  not  the   manner,  but  the  subject  of  their  ministry:  "Who  hath  made  us  able  ministers,"   saith  he,  "of  the  New  Testament:  Not  of  the  letter,  but  of  the  Spirit:  For  the   letter  killeth,  but  the  Spirit  giveth  life."  Here  lies  the  great  difference  between   the  two  dispensations:  That  the  law  was  indeed  spiritual  in  its  demands,   requiring  a  life  consecrated  to  God  in  the  observance  of  many  rules;  but,  not   conveying  spiritual  assistance,  its  effect  was  only  to  kill  and  mortify  man,  by   giving  him  to  understand,  that  he  must  needs  be  in  a  state  of  great  depravity,   since  he  found  it  so  difficult  to  obey  God;  and  that,  as  particular  deaths  were  by   that  institution  inflicted  for  particular  sins,  so  death,  in  general,  was  but  the   consequence  of  his  universal  sinfulness.  But  the  ministration  of  the  New   Testament  was  that  of  a  "Spirit  which  giveth  life;"  --  a  Spirit,  not  only  promised,   but  actually  conferred;  which  should  both  enable  Christians  now  to  live  unto   God,  and  fulfill  precepts  even  more  spiritual  than  the  former;  and  restore  them   hereafter  to  perfect  life,  after  the  ruins  of  sin  and  death.  The  incarnation,   preaching,  and  death  of  Jesus  Christ  were  designed  to  represent,  proclaim,  and   purchase  for  us  this  gift  of  the  Spirit;  and  therefore  says  the  Apostle,  "The  Lord   is  that  Spirit,"  or  the  Spirit  (Wesley,  1736).      This  opening  narrative  is  an  example  of  Wesley's  use  of  diegesis.  While  he  uses  

direct  quotes  from  Paul,  Wesley  takes  on  a  definitive  role  as  narrator.  For  example,   he  adds  his  own  commentary  when  discussing  the  differences  between  the  law  and   the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  "Here  lies  the  great  difference  between  the  two   dispensations:  That  the  law  was  indeed  spiritual  in  its  demands,  requiring  a  life   consecrated  to  God  in  the  observance  of  many  rules...  But  the  ministration  of  the   New  Testament  was  that  of  a  "Spirit  which  giveth  life;"  --  a  Spirit,  not  only  promised,   but  actually  conferred"  (Wesley,  1736).      Wesley  uses  another  narrative  that  also  describes  the  work  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  

this  time  using  Adam  and  Eve  as  examples:               Our  first  parents  did  enjoy  the  presence  of  the  Holy  Spirit;  for  they  were   created  in  the  image  and  likeness  of  God,  which  was  no  other  than  his  Spirit.   By  that  he  communicates  himself  to  his  creatures,  and  by  that  alone  they  can   31  

              

bear  any  likeness  to  him.  It  is,  indeed,  his  life  in  them;  and  so  properly  divine,   that,  upon  this  ground,  angels  and  regenerate  men  are  called  his  children. But  when  man  would  not  be  guided  by  the  Holy  Spirit,  it  left  him  (Wesley,   1736).  

Again,  Wesley  uses  diegesis.  Wesley  is  telling  the  story  from  Genesis  from  an  outside   perspective  and  takes  on  the  voice  of  a  narrator.  Wesley  outlines  the  creation  story   and  how  in  the  beginning,  Adam  and  Eve  enjoyed  perfect  fellowship  with  God.   However,  this  relationship  was  broken  when  Adam  and  Eve  disobeyed  God's   commandment.9     Wesley  then  outlines  how  Christ's  life,  death  and  resurrection  provide  the   way  for  people  to  again  enjoy  the  presence  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  The  remainder  of  his   sermon  is  instruction  for  how  to  live  a  holy  life  guided  by  the  Holy  Spirit.  He   admonishes  his  listeners  not  to  allow  bitterness,  anxiety  or  anger  to  be  defining   characteristics  but  instead  to  be  meek,  discerning  and  hard  working  (Wesley,  1736).   Wesley  presents  his  narratives  in  "On  the  Holy  Spirit"  from  "the  level  above   the  primary  story"  (Shen,  2005).  Since  2  Corinthians  3  is  theological  discussion,   Wesley's  use  of  short  diegetic  stories  and  brief  summaries  allows  for  a  change  of   pace  in  the  sermon  without  the  need  to  go  into  deep  detail  with  mimesis.     Like  Wesley,  Beeson's  approach  in  presenting  2  Corinthians  3  through  his   message  "Picture  This,  Part  Two"  is  varied  from  his  approach  when  preaching  on   Acts  4.  Instead  of  relying  on  large  amounts  of  narrative,  Beeson  too  focuses  on  the   instruction  of  the  text.  His  first  narrative  of  the  sermon  leads  into  discussion  of  the   passage  itself:                                                                                                                    9  Genesis  3:1-7      32  

     

  

God  is  offering  a  new  covenant,  a  new  relationship,  the  opportunity  to  enter   into  his  family,  his  kingdom,  to  walk  in  his  light  with  his  love.  It's  a  new   covenant.   Now  a  covenant  is  a  contract  ­  some  of  you  know  what  a  covenant  is   from  when  you  moved  into  your  neighborhood  and  you  had  to  sign  the   neighborhood  covenant  that  said,  "Put  a  fence  around  your  swimming  pool   and  do  not  let  your  dog  run  around".  The  covenant  of  the  neighborhood  is   that  you  shovel  the  sidewalk  in  front  of  your  house.  This  is  what  a  covenant  is   according  to  the  dictionary:  it's  usually  formal,  solemn  and  a  binding   agreement  or  pact.  A  written  agreement  or  promise  usually  under  the  seal  of   two  or  more  parties  especially  for  the  performance  of  some  action.  Now  any   time  you  enter  into  a  covenant  community,  you  understand  that  you're   choosing  it  ­  you  choose  to  go  into  covenant  and  you  want  it,  you  long  for  it.   So  it  is  when  you  come  to  God  or  rather,  when  God  comes  to  you.  And  you   say,  "That's  what  I  want!  I  want  to  walk  in  the  light!  I'd  love  to  be  in  a   covenant  community  where  there's  trust  and  honor  and  people  help  each   other  and  there's  forgiveness  and  grace  and  mercy!  I  would  love  to  be  in  that   kind  of  covenant  community!"  And  God  says,  "That's  the  kind  of  community   that  I  want,  I  want  to  be  your  God  and  you  can  be  my  people!"  Don't  you  want   that?   And  our  covenant  God  has  invited  us  to  understand  the  covenant!  God   says,  "Look,  if  you  want  to  walk  in  the  light  and  live  in  the  light  and  be  in   covenant  so  that  there's  trust  and  joy  and  hope  and  confidence  in  each  other,   deep  rich  friendship,  then  there's  a  few  things  you're  going  to  want  to  know   about  how  we  live  together  and  what  covenant  looks  like."  So  from  the  time   God  called  Abram  until  God  gave  Moses  the  Ten  Commandments,  God   establishes  covenant  and  God  invites  us  in  and  He  says,  "There's  a  way  to  live   and  it  works!"  (Beeson,  2011).  

Beeson's  opening  narrative  provides  an  example  of  both  diegesis  and  mimesis.  First,   Beeson  describes  God's  covenant  as  "a  new  relationship,  the  opportunity  to  enter   into  his  family,  his  kingdom,  to  walk  in  his  light  with  his  love"  and  explains  that  a   covenant  is  a  type  of  contract.  Immediately  after  this  explanation,  Beeson  goes  into   the  personal  example  of  a  neighbourhood  contract.  This  explanation  is  a  way  to   change  the  pace  of  the  sermon,  keep  his  audience's  attention  but  also  to  give  a  more   approachable  example.  He  provides  a  third  party  narrator's  view  of  the   neighbourhood  contract.  However,  when  describing  God's  setup  of  a  covenant,  he  

  

33  

uses  mimesis,  adding  creative  dialogue  to  the  narrative  so  that  his  congregation  will   clearly  understand  his  point.  He  provides  the  voice  of  a  person  entering  into  the  new   covenant,  "That's  what  I  want!  I  want  to  walk  in  the  light!  I'd  love  to  be  in  a  covenant   community  where  there's  trust  and  honor  and  people  help  each  other  and  there's   forgiveness  and  grace  and  mercy!  I  would  love  to  be  in  that  kind  of  covenant   community!"  and  also  provides  God's  response,  "That's  the  kind  of  community  that  I   want,  I  want  to  be  your  God  and  you  can  be  my  people!"  This  dialogue  is  a  use  of   mimesis.      Like  Wesley,  Beeson  continues  his  sermon  by  describing  what  a  Christian's  

life  looks  like  when  he  or  she  chooses  to  live  under  the  direction  of  the  Holy  Spirit.     Beeson  stresses  again  the  importance  of  the  covenant  he  illustrates  at  the  beginning   of  the  sermon.  If  a  Christian  is  living  in  a  true  covenant  relationship  with  the  Holy   Spirit,  he  or  she  shows  complete  submission  to  the  Holy  Spirit's  leadership.   Likewise,  this  submission  showcases  itself  in  the  church  as  a  whole.  Beeson  stresses   this  point  and  adds  in  a  short  narrative  to  ensure  that  his  listeners  remember  his   point  about  leadership  within  the  church  as  a  whole  and  within  Granger  Community   Church  specifically,   Just  so  no  one  is  confused  at  Granger  Community  Church  about  who  is   leading,  I  want  to  get  very  clear.  You  should  not  wonder  who  the  leader  is  of   the  church.  You  shouldn't  wonder  about  who's  leading  the  work,  who's   responsible.  It  says  in  Mark  8,  Jesus  said,  "Anyone  who  intends  to  come  to  me   and  come  with  me  has  to  let  me  lead."  So  in  the  covenant  community,  who  is   leading?  Jesus!    There's  no  doubt  about  it,  no  one's  vying  for  the  position,  he   is  the  sovereign  leader,  sovereign  Lord  of  the  covenant  community,  Jesus  is   our  leader.  Remember  when  you're  in  first  grade  in  Sunday  School?  Every   question  the  teacher  asked,  the  answer's  Jesus.  In  first  grade  Sunday  School,   you  could  count  on  that.  And  not  just  in  first  grade  Sunday  school,  it's  pretty   good  when  you  think  about  it  all  your  life.  The  answer  to  almost  any  question   is  Jesus.  He  is  our  leader!  (Beeson,  2011).      34  

   Beeson  again  showcases  the  mix  of  mimesis  and  diegesis.  First,  when  he  points  to   Mark  8,  Beeson  uses  mimesis  by  paraphrasing  Jesus'  words.  Beeson  wants  to  stress   the  importance  of  Christ's  leadership  so  the  use  of  Christ's  command  emphasizes  its   importance.  When  Beeson  moves  to  the  example  of  the  Sunday  School  class,  he  uses   diegesis  to  describe  the  situation  briefly.  By  using  diegesis,  his  brief  narrative   doesn't  detract  from  his  point  that  the  leader  of  the  church  is  Jesus  Christ.      Beeson  continues  his  focus  on  the  importance  of  Christ's  leadership  by  

pointing  to  another  passage,  this  time  in  Matthew  28:   "Jesus  said  to  his  disciples,  `All  authority  in  heaven  and  on  earth  has  been   given  to  me'"  (Matthew  28:18).  Why?  Because  he's  the  leader!  He's  the  one!   "Therefore,  Jesus  said,  `Go,  make  disciples  of  all  nations,  baptizing  them  in  the   name  of  the  Father,  Son  and  Holy  Spirit  and  teaching  them  to  obey   everything  I've  commanded  you  and  surely  I  will  be  with  you  always  to  the   very  end  of  the  age'"  (Matthew  28:19).     Jesus  says  that  this  is  our  cause,  this  is  our  mission.  This  is  our  leader   and  our  mission  is  clear.  Jesus  says  we're  going  to  love  God  and  love  others.   Jesus  says  we're  going  to  go  wherever  we  go  and  wherever  we  are,  we're  to   do  the  work  of  the  kingdom!  He  is  the  leader,  not  us;  he  is  the  driver;  not  us  ­   follow  me,  stay  with  me.     

  

This  retelling  of  Jesus'  final  instructions  to  his  disciples  is  another  example  of   mimesis.  Beeson  again  uses  Christ's  words  directly  from  the  Bible  and  inserts  them   into  a  creative  telling.  This  style  allows  for  emphasis  on  Christ's  words  while  also   garnering  attention  by  framing  them  creatively.        Beeson's  style  varies  from  the  long  examples  of  mimesis  he  showcases  in  the  

first  "Picture  This"  sermon.  His  narratives  are  shorter  and  more  directly  related  to   his  challenge  to  the  congregation  that  they  fully  commit  themselves  to  the  Holy  

  

35  

Spirit's  direction.  In  this  case,  Beeson  is  reflecting  Goldberg's  belief  that  narratives   can  develop  convictions  and  challenge  a  listener's  previous  worldview.

ANALYSIS:  SERMONS  BASED  ON  EPHESIANS  6  
Ephesians  6  is  another  of  the  apostle  Paul's  letters,  this  time  to  the  Christians  in   Ephesus.  The  ultimate  theme  of  the  passage  is  reconciliation,  the  idea  that  Jesus   Christ  is  working  all  situations  together  for  God's  glory  (Peterson,  2002).  However,   Paul  reminds  the  Christians  in  Ephesus  not  to  rely  on  their  own  ability  to  rectify   difficult  situations.  Their  power  ultimately  came  from  the  Holy  Spirit  and  they   needed  to  make  sure  that  they  depended  on  him  to  overcome  evil  forces  in  the   world.      Wesley  uses  a  mix  of  both  biblical  and  personal  narrative  in  presenting  this  

passage  in  his  sermon  "Of  Evil  Angels".  Wesley  begins  by  describing  the  origin  of  evil   spirits:   With  regard  to  the  First,  we  cannot  doubt  but  all  the  angels  of  God  were   originally  of  the  same  nature.  Unquestionably  they  were  the  highest  order  of   created  beings.  They  were  spirits,  pure  ethereal  creatures,  simple  and   incorruptible;  if  not  wholly  immaterial,  yet  certainly  not  incumbered  with   gross,  earthly  flesh  and  blood.  As  spirits,  they  were  endued  with   understanding,  with  affections,  and  with  liberty,  or  a  power  of  self- determination;  so  that  it  lay  in  themselves,  either  to  continue  in  their   allegiance  to  God,  or  to  rebel  against  him.      And  their  original  properties  were,  doubtless,  the  same  with  those  of  the   holy  angels.  There  is  no  absurdity  in  supposing  Satan  their  chief,  otherwise   styled,  "Lucifer,  son  of  the  morning,"  to  have  been  at  least  one  "of  the  first,  if   not  the  first  Archangel."  Like  the  other  sons  of  the  morning,  they  had  a  height   and  depth  of  understanding  quite  incomprehensible  to  us.  In  consequence  of   this  they  had  such  knowledge  and  wisdom,  that  the  wisest  of  the  children  of   men  (had  men  then  existed)  would  have  been  mere  idiots  in  comparison  of   them.  Their  strength  was  equal  to  their  knowledge;  such  as  it  cannot  enter  into   our  heart  to  conceive;  neither  can  we  conceive  to  how  wide  a  sphere  of  action   either  their  strength  or  their  knowledge  extended.  Their  number  God  alone   can  tell:  Doubtless  it  was  only  less  than  infinite.  And  a  third  part  of  these  stars   of  heaven  the  arch-rebel  drew  after  him  (Wesley,  2011).     

  

37  

  

This  description  of  Lucifer's  and  his  followers'  rebellion  against  God  is  told  as  

a  diegetic  narrative.  Wesley's  choice  to  use  third  person  narration  is  logical  at  this   point  in  the  sermon  as  his  credibility  is  strengthened  by  maintaining  the  voice  of  the   narrator.  Through  his  use  of  an  active  voice  within  the  narrative,  he  reinforces  the   fact  that  he  is  well-studied  in  his  subject  and  this  credibility  is  needed  with  a   difficult  and  often  taboo  topic  like  evil  spirits.  Wesley  goes  on  to  depict  the  existence   of  evil  spirits  as  recorded  throughout  the  Bible.  At  one  point,  he  condenses  several   instances  into  a  single  short  narrative,  "Thus  he  `entered  into  Judas,'  and  confirmed   him  in  the  design  of  betraying  his  Master;  thus  he  `put  it  into  the  heart'  of  Ananias   and  Sapphira  `to  lie  unto  the  Holy  Ghost;'  and,  in  like  manner,  he  has  a  share  in  all   the  actions  and  words  and  designs  of  evil  men"  (Wesley,  2011).    This  short  narrative   points  to  various  undeniable  instances  of  evil  in  the  Bible.  Its  effectiveness,  though,   is  in  tying  these  biblical  examples  with  the  fact  that  evil  spirits  were  behind  every   harmful  action  and  word  in  Wesley's  time.      Wesley  then  moves  to  the  second  point  of  his  sermon.  He  describes  the  work  

of  evil  spirits  and  how  their  ultimate  goal  is  to  make  Christians  stumble  in  their   efforts  to  follow  Christ.  Wesley  points  out  that  Christ  himself  was  tempted  while  on   earth,   They  are  (remember,  so  far  as  God  permits!)  governors  of  the  world!  So  that   there  may  be  more  ground  than  we  are  apt  to  imagine  for  that  strange   expression  of  Satan,  (Matt.  4:8-9,)  when  he  showed  our  Lord  "all  the  kingdoms   of  the  world,  and  the  glory  of  them,  `All  these  things  will  I  give  thee,  if  thou  wilt   fall  down  and  worship  me'."  It  is  a  little  more  particularly  expressed  in  the   fourth  chapter  of  St.  Luke:  "The  devil  showed  unto  him  all  the  kingdoms  of  the   world  in  a  moment  of  time."  (Such  an  astonishing  measure  of  power  is  still  left   in  the  prince  of  darkness!)  "And  the  devil  said,  All  this  power  will  I  give  thee,   and  the  glory  of  them:  For  that  is  delivered  unto  me;  and  to  whomsoever  I  will,   I  give  it"  (Matt.  4:5,  6)  (Wesley,  2011).      38  

   While  Wesley  uses  Satan's  words  to  showcase  his  character  in  the  narrative,  he   continues  to  use  diegesis.  Wesley's  own  insights  as  narrator  are  evident  in  this   example.  He  adds  them  as  the  narrative  progresses,  at  one  point  noting  that  that  evil   spirits  are  "governors  of  the  world"  but  also  reminding  his  audience,  "remember,  so   far  as  God  permits!"  He  also  enters  into  the  story  along  with  his  audience,  describing   Christ  as  "our  Lord".  This  simple  inclusion  portrays  that  Wesley  is  learning  and   growing  along  with  his  congregation,  not  simply  passing  along  knowledge.   Wesley  cautions  his  listeners  not  to  be  deceived  into  thinking  that  these  evil   spirits  existed  only  in  biblical  times.  To  illustrate  this  point,  he  uses  a  personal   anecdote:                        At  this  point,  Wesley's  use  of  narrative  becomes  mimetic  as  he  describes  a  past   situation  in  detail  with  full  dialogue.  At  this  point  in  the  sermon,  Wesley  has   provided  a  biblical  overview  on  the  subject  of  evil  spirits  and  can  now  enter  fully   into  a  current  narrative  to  reinforce  his  points.  A  narrative  using  mimesis  is  the   most  effective  way  to  illustrate  and  also  captivate  the  audience.      Wesley's  use  of  both  biblical  and  current  narratives  is  reflective  of  Goldberg's   Many  years  ago  I  was  asking  an  experienced  physician,  and  one  particularly   eminent  for  curing  lunacy,  "Sir,  have  you  not  seen  reason  to  believe  that   some  lunatics  are  really  demoniacs?"  He  answered,  "Sir,  I  have  been  often   inclined  to  think  that  most  lunatics  are  demoniacs.  Nor  is  there  any  weight  in   that  objection,  that  they  are  frequently  cured  by  medicine:  For  so  might  any   other  disease  occasioned  by  an  evil  spirit,  if  God  did  not  suffer  him  to  repeat   the  stroke  by  which  that  disease  is  occasioned"  (Wesley,  2011).  

work  that  pointed  to  narratives  as  a  means  to  make  seemingly  disconnected   theology  flow  together  to  ease  an  audience's  understanding.  By  combining  many   biblical  examples,  Wesley  shows  the  existence  and  actions  of  evil  spirits  throughout      39  

the  Bible.  However,  Wesley's  desire  is  for  his  congregation  to  be  aware  of  evil  spirits   and  their  prevalence.  By  showcasing  a  narrative  from  his  day,  Wesley  uses  narrative   to  urge  his  congregation  to  remain  strong  in  their  faith  to  resist  temptation  by  evil   spirits.     Granger  Community  Church's  analysis  of  Ephesians  6  is  within  a  series  of   sermons  based  on  popular  films.  For  this  particular  sermon  entitled  "Robin  Hood",   Pastor  Rob  Wegner  uses  the  current  film  version  of  Robin  Hood  starting  Russell   Crowe  as  his  basis.  However,  he  first  uses  a  personal  narrative  to  share  his  initial   encounter  with  the  classic  story:   The  first  time  I  ran  into  [the  story  of  Robin  Hood]  was  when  I  was   elementary  school-aged.  I  grew  up  in  the  south  side  of  Chicago  and  on   Sunday  afternoons,  on  channel  9,  there  was  this  show  called  Family  Classics.   Has  anyone  seen  Family  Classics?  I  bet  right  now  there  is  this  warm  affection   rising  for  Frasier  Thomas,  am  I  right?  He  was  like  a  grandfather  to  all  of  us.   He  was  the  host  of  the  show  ­  a  warm,  yet  stately  man.  The  show  would   begin  with  this  classical  music  and  he  would  be  standing  in  front  of  this  big   bookshelf  and  there  were  all  these  leather-bound  volumes  and  these  were   symbolic  of  the  family  classics.  Frasier  Thomas  came  up  with  this  canon  of   movies  and  he  would  pull  one  down  and  let  you  know  which  one  you  were   going  to  watch.  And  our  whole  family  would  gather  on  Sunday  afternoons  ­   we'd  go  to  church  in  the  morning,  we'd  eat  lunch  together  and  then  we  would   gather  around  Frasier  Thomas  and  the  Family  Classics.     Now,  you've  got  to  remember  this  was  back  before  there  were  VCRs   or  DVD  players  or  Blu-Ray  players  so  you  couldn't  go  out  and  watch  a  movie   so  this  was  a  big  deal!  So  if  you  wanted  your  classic  movie  fix,  he  was  the  only   dealer  on  the  block  that  could  get  you  the  crack  that  you  needed  ­  he  was  the   only  guy!  So  we  really  looked  forward  to  it  (Wegner,  2010).  

   Wegner's  opening  narrative  provides  context  for  the  story  of  Robin  Hood  and  also  

serves  to  capture  his  audience's  attention.  While  he  doesn't  use  any  direct  dialogue,   Wegner  immerses  his  audience  in  the  scenes.  First,  he  describes  the  Family  Classics   set  in  detail,  citing  Frasier  Thomas's  appearance  and  his  surroundings  of  the  big   bookshelf  with  the  leather-bound  volumes.  Wegner  also  describes  the  weekly  rituals      40  

of  church  on  Sunday  morning,  lunch  as  a  family  and  then  gathering  around  the   television  for  Family  Classics.      Wegner  also  captures  his  audience's  attention  with  humour.  By  describing  

Frasier  Thomas  as  "the  only  dealer  on  the  block"  who  could  provide  "the  crack   (classic  movies)  that  you  needed",  Wegner  ensures  that  he  has  the  audience's  full   attention  and  can  introduce  the  story  itself  with  this  narrative,   Now  there  was  a  set  amount  of  movies  in  the  Family  Classics  canon  so  you   knew  which  ones  were  coming  and  he  played  a  lot  of  them  at  the  same  time   of  the  year  and  my  two  favorites  were  War  of  the  Worlds...  and  then  the  other   one  starred  Errol  Flynn  and  it  was  called  Robin  Hood.  How  many  of  you  have   seen  that  old  classic  version?  As  a  kid,  this  was  two  hours  of  action-packed   adventure  and  it  was  one  of  my  favorite  movies.  But  I  have  a  confession  to   make  ­  I  watched  it  about  ten  or  fifteen  years  later  when  I  was  in  my  early   twenties  and  by  this  point  in  time,  I'd  been  corrected  by  all  the  action  stars  of   the  80s  like  Sylvester  Stallone  and  Arnold  so  when  I  watched  it,  I  was   completely  underwhelmed  and  disappointed.  I  liked  Errol  Flynn  but  he  was  a   skinny  guy  wearing  tight  pants  and  a  green  birthday  hat,  you  know?  And  the   whole  time,  he  pranced  around  kind  of  like  a  ballet  dancer.  So  it's  a  good   thing  Errol  Flynn  isn't  the  only  leading  star  to  take  this  role.  Over  the  years,   lots  of  different  actors  have  strapped  on  the  green  tights.  You've  got  Kevin   Costner  and  now  you've  got  Russell  Crowe.  And  it's  interesting  with  the  story   because  it  has  such  longevity.  It's  been  around  for  hundreds  and  hundreds  of   years  and  it  has  been  retold  over  and  over  again  but  that  really  made  me  stop   and  think:  What's  the  staying  power  of  Robin  Hood?   Here's  what  I'm  proposing  ­  I  think  Robin  Hood  was  developed  at  just   the  right  time  in  literature  and  in  civilization  where  he  became  this  iconic   symbol  for  the  underdog.  He  became  this  ultimate  symbol  of  seeking  justice   for  those  that  are  downtrodden  and  oppressed  and  pushed  down  ­  Robin   Hood  emerged  in  this  world  where  there  were  these  feudal  lords  and  they   were  oppressing  the  peasants  and  basically  using  their  power  for  personal   benefit.  Yes,  Robin  Hood  was  this  outlaw  vigilante  but  only  because  those   who  were  supposed  to  uphold  the  law  were  so  corrupt  that  to  obey  the  law   was  actually  unlawful  in  itself.  So  he  became  this  rebel  philanthropist  who   stood  up  for  the  average  person  and  said  "NO!  You  can't  just  grind  these   people  under  your  feet."  He  was  the  one  who  drew  the  line  in  the  sand  over  a   corrupt  monarchy  and  said,  "That's  it  and  no  more!"  He  did  what  he  needed   to  do  to  stand  up  for  the  underdog  (Wegner,  2010).

Wegner  once  again  engages  his  audience  with  detailed  descriptions  about  his   childhood  memories  of  Family  Classics  and  more  specifically,  his  first  impression  of   the  Robin  Hood  story.  This  detailed  description  is  another  use  of  mimesis.  However,   when  Wegner  talks  about  the  impact  of  the  Robin  Hood  story,  he  switches  to   diegesis.  Wegner  notes,  "I  think  Robin  Hood  was  developed  at  just  the  right  time  in   literature  and  in  civilization  where  he  became  this  iconic  symbol  for  the  underdog".   With  this  introduction,  Wegner  takes  on  the  guiding  voice  of  a  narrator,  inserting  his   own  thoughts  of  why  the  Robin  Hood  story  has  been  so  powerful  and  captivating  for   so  many  generations.  Wegner  uses  rich  descriptions  for  Robin  Hood  like  "outlaw   vigilante"  and  "rebel  philanthropist"  to  provide  creative  insight  into  the  character.   The  switch  to  diegesis  is  also  appropriate  at  this  point  because  Wegner  comes  back   to  these  insights  later  in  the  sermon  when  he  provides  the  sermon's  challenge  for   the  Granger  congregation.   Since  his  sermon  is  framed  around  a  story,  it's  appropriate  that  Wegner  uses   a  great  deal  of  narrative  in  this  sermon.  After  using  Ephesians  6  and  pointing  to   God's  opinion  of  injustice  and  evil,  Wegner  again  uses  narrative.  This  time,  he  draws   parallels  between  Robin  Hood  and  the  Old  Testament  character  David10  in  order  to   present  David  as  a  hero,      So  I'm  going  to  go  through  a  list  and  I  want  you  to  tell  me  who  you  think  this   biblical  character  is.  Like  Robin  Hood,  he  was  a  crusader  for  his  people,  for   the  underdog.  Like  Robin  Hood,  he  was  chased  by  a  corrupt  king.  Like  Robin   Hood,  he  had  an  accuracy  with  flying  projectiles.  Like  Robin  Hood,  he  put   together  his  own  band  of  ragtag  warriors,  his  own  group  of  merry  men  who                                                                                                                    10  David  was  the  second  king  of  Israel.  Despite  many  mistakes  and  difficult   situations  over  the  course  of  his  life  and  reign,  David  is  described  as  "a  man  after   God's  own  heart"  (1  Samuel  13:14,  Acts  13:22).      42  

had  a  fierce  loyalty  to  him.  Like  Robin  Hood,  his  story  is  one  about  standing   up  against  a  giant  of  injustice,  against  the  odds,  simply  because  it's  the  right   thing  to  do.  Who's  the  original  Robin  Hood?  David!   We  know  the  story  of  David  and  Goliath.  This  story  creates  a  kind  of   equilibrium  ­  it  creates  a  feeling  inside  of  us  that  symbolizes  something   powerful  and  beautiful.  Let  me  illustrate  ­  most  of  us  who  are  parents  in  this   room  are  not  going  to  let  our  kids  sit  down  and  watch  a  movie  that  features   small  children  decapitating  adults.  It's  just  not  going  to  happen.  And  yet,   those  same  parents,  myself  included,  have  a  children's  Bible  at  home  that  has   a  picture  of  David  with  Goliath's  head  in  his  hands.  Now,  why  is  that?  There's   something  much  deeper  going  on.  This  isn't  just  about  some  kind  of  battle   that  involved  simply  geopolitical  nations  and  it  stopped  there.  It  wasn't  about   revenge  ­  much  deeper!  (Wegner,  2010)      Similar  to  Wesley's  strategy  at  the  beginning  of  "On  Evil  Spirits",  Wegner  maintains   a  third  party  narrator  stance  in  this  narrative.  Using  diegesis,  Wegner  is  able  to   easily  move  from  having  his  audience  look  at  the  similarities  between  Robin  Hood   and  David  to  an  overview  of  the  story  of  David  and  Goliath.  Wegner's  use  of  clues   and  having  the  audience  guess  the  biblical  character  he  is  referring  to  is  another   tactic  that  Wegner  uses  to  engage  his  audience.  Once  Wegner  reveals  that  the   biblical  character  is  David,  he  offers  some  creative  insights  on  the  famous  David  and   Goliath  story.  Wegner  notes,  "Most  of  us  who  are  parents  in  this  room  are  not  going   to  let  our  kids  sit  down  and  watch  a  movie  that  features  small  children  decapitating   adults."  This  graphic  example  is  a  way  to  have  the  audience  look  at  the  story  in  a   new  way.  Instead  of  a  simple  biblical  story,  Wegner  is  setting  up  the  David  and   Goliath  story  to  contribute  to  his  points  about  injustice.   Immediately  after  this  narrative,  Wegner  continues  his  sermon  with   examples  of  injustice  from  the  Bible.  His  use  of  diegesis  is  effective  with  this   narrative  so  that  Wegner  can  easily  move  from  narrative  to  application  points   without  a  change  in  voice  from  a  character  in  the  story  to  pastor.

He  continues  this  strategy  when  pointing  back  to  a  previous  speaker  at  

Granger  Community  Church  and  comparing  him  to  David,      I  think  of  Judge  Miller...  He  talked  about  reading  the  newspaper  one  morning   and  he  sees  this  picture  of  a  homeless  veteran  who's  sleeping  at  below   freezing  level.  He  was  sleeping  in  a  box  that  looked  just  like  a  coffin.  He  said   something  snapped  and  that's  all  he  could  stand.  He  wasn't  going  to  let  that   giant  roam  in  his  town...  A  lot  of  guys  his  age  would  have  been  thinking  about   a  comfortable  retirement.  But  Judge  Miller  stood  up  and  he  grabbed  his  sling   and  he  ran  to  the  battle.  And  I  want  to  say,  what  kind  of  thing  gets  that  kind   of  response  out  of  you  friends?  What  is  it?   Look  at  David's  response:  "What  will  be  done  for  the  man  who  kills   this  Philistine  and  removes  this  disgrace  from  Israel?  Who  is  this   uncircumcised  Philistine  that  he  should  defy  the  armies  of  the  living  God?"   David  realizes  that  there's  something  deeper  going  on  here.  In  other   words,  there's  a  battle  going  on  between  the  serpent,  the  corrupt  king,  and   the  King  of  kings.  He  realizes  that  he's  at  the  right  place  at  the  right  time  and   no  one's  doing  anything!  Maybe  I'm  the  right  one.  Maybe  I'm  the  giant  slayer   (Wegner,  2010).      Wegner  again  uses  diegesis  and  maintains  the  voice  of  a  narrator.  With  this   example,  his  style  is  effective  when  presenting  a  challenge  to  the  congregation.  He   also  ties  his  earlier  narrative  about  David  and  Goliath  into  this  new  story  about   Judge  Miller.  Wegner  describes  the  injustice  of  a  veteran  sleeping  on  the  street  as   "that  giant"  and  that  in  response,  Judge  Miller  "grabbed  his  sling  and  he  ran  to  the   battle."  In  addition  to  adding  vivid  imagery  to  his  story,  this  tactic  also  allows  for   Wegner  to  once  again  return  to  the  story  of  David  and  Goliath  and  draw   comparisons.  Wegner  then  presents  these  verses  from  Ephesians  6:   Finally,  be  strong  in  the  Lord  and  in  his  mighty  power.  Put  on  the  full  armor   of  God,  so  that  you  can  take  your  stand  against  the  devil's  schemes.  For  our   struggle  is  not  against  flesh  and  blood,  but  against  the  rulers,  against  the   authorities,  against  the  powers  of  this  dark  world  and  against  the  spiritual   forces  of  evil  in  the  heavenly  realms  (Ephesians  6:10-12).     

  

44  

Wegner  continues  his  challenge  to  the  congregation  to  look  at  their  own  lives  and   what  battles  they  find  themselves  in.  Wegner  points  out  many  everyday  examples  of   injustice  and  draws  parallels  between  these  daily  battles  and  the  stories  of  both   David  and  Robin  Hood.      To  draw  the  sermon  to  a  close,  Wegner  again  uses  a  similar  strategy  to  

Wesley's  and  begins  to  wind  down  the  sermon  with  a  personal  story.  Wegner  calls   his  story  "The  Wet  Wipe  Warmer  Incident"  (full  version  in  Appendix  A)  and   explains:   My  youngest  daughter  was  born  in  December  2003  and  we  had  one  of  those   wet  wipe  warmers...  a  couple  weeks  after  our  youngest  was  born,  it  just  up   and  died  on  us.  So  my  wife  sent  me  on  a  mission  to  retrieve  a  new  wet  wipe   warmer.  So  I  went  to  the  local  pharmacy,  got  in  line  where  there  was  only   one  cash  open  so  it  was  kind  of  a  long  line.  This  lady  pulls  up  behind  me...  As   we're  standing  there,  she  asks,  "What  is  it  that  you  have  there?"  And  I'm   standing  holding  the  wet  wipe  warmer  thinking,  "This  is  going  to  be   awesome  because  I  am  a  super  dad  and  I'm  going  to  be  perceived  as  a   nurturing  dad  who  is  so  loving  to  his  newborn  baby".  So  I  turn  around  and   tell  her  it's  a  wet  wipe  warmer  and  it's  for  my  new  little  girl.  She  doesn't  look   happy  and  asks,  "Can  I  see  that?"  and  at  this  point,  there  should  have  been   warning  bells  in  my  head.  But  I  hand  over  the  wet  wipe  warmer  and  she   turns  it  over  and  reads  the  back  then  hands  it  back,  locks  eyes  with  me  and   says,  "What's  that  for?"...    And  she  launched  into  a  tirade.  She  yelled,  "That  is   the  most  obtuse,  appalling  appliance  I  have  ever  seen!"...  And  then  there  was   this  pause  and  everyone  in  line  was  watching  and  it  was  my  moment  to  have   a  clever,  cunning  comeback  so  I  looked  at  her  and  I  said,  "Uhh,  it's  a  wet  wipe   warmer."  I  couldn't  think  of  anything  else  to  say...  But  on  the  way  home,  I   thought,  "Wow,  she  wanted  a  fight."  And  it  almost  didn't  matter  who  it  was   (Wegner,  2010).  

   Wegner's  story  is  an  example  of  mimesis  because  he  recreates  the  scene  of  the  

pharmacy,  describes  the  people  involved  and  delves  into  the  dialogue.  This  light- hearted  example  brings  Wegner  to  his  final  closing  point  of  being  able  to  recognize   instances  of  injustice,  actions  that  can  be  taken  and  not  wasting  energy  on  the   wrong  battle.      45  

  

Wegner  returns  to  his  earlier  strategy  of  using  diegesis  to  reinforce  his  point  

with  his  final  narrative  and  closing  remarks,   I  read  about  an  experiment  that  was  done  at  the  University  of  California,  at   Berkeley.  This  scientist  took  an  amoeba  ­  perfect  life,  perfect  temperature,   perfect  nutrients  and  they  made  it  a  stress-free  environment.  And  you  know   what  happened  to  the  amoeba?  It  died.  It  had  all  this  safety  and  security  and   comfort  and  it  died.  And  you  know,  that  illusion  of  building  a  castle,  looking   out  for  you  and  your  own  ­  it  will  kill  your  soul.  You  know  when  you  really   come  alive?  When  you,  like  David,  realize  that  you're  the  right  person  at  the   right  place  at  the  right  time  and  you're  being  invited  to  be  a  giant  slayer.  You   pick  up  your  sling  and  look  evil  in  the  eye  and  you  fight  for  all  that  you're   worth.  At  that  moment,  you  will  feel  the  power  of  God  surge  through  you  like   never  before  and  when  you  find  the  battle,  you  will  come  alive.  And  that's   what  I'm  praying  for  you.      It  is  important  that  Wegner  maintains  his  voice  as  narrator  in  this  story  because  at   this  point,  he  delivers  his  challenge  to  the  congregation.  He  draws  a  parallel   between  the  amoeba  and  a  person  who  lives  their  life  comfortably  and  unconcerned   about  injustice  or  the  wellbeing  of  others.  Instead,  Wegner  urges  his  audience  to  run   into  the  battles  that  they  encounter  in  everyday  life,  just  as  David  bravely   encountered  Goliath.  Wegner  reinforces  the  story  and  his  point  with  a  promise,  "you   will  feel  the  power  of  God  surge  through  you  like  never  before  and  when  you  find   the  battle,  you  will  come  alive".      The  respective  stories  of  David  and  Robin  Hood  could  easily  be  construed  as  

disconnected.  However,  like  Wesley,  Wegner  combines  stories  of  a  differing  nature   to  bring  his  congregation  to  the  application  point  of  his  message.  The  discussion  of   both  David  and  Robin  Hood  reveals  the  commonality  of  social  justice.  By  combining   these  seemingly  unrelated  stories  to  deliver  a  challenging  application,  Wegner   reflects  Goldberg's  idea  that  narratives  can  provide  connections  between  our   experiences.  Wegner  could  have  easily  struggled  with  a  sermon  topic  that  urges      46  

people  to  go  past  their  comfort  zones  and  be  active  in  social  justice.  However,  by   using  a  variety  of  captivating  narratives,  Wegner  holds  the  congregation's  attention,   uses  the  stories  to  build  reassurance  and  delivers  a  captivating  call  to  action.

ANALYSIS:  SERMONS  BASED  ON  COLOSSIANS  
The  next  pair  of  sermons  is  based  on  the  book  of  Colossians.  The  book  of  Colossians   is  another  letter  by  the  apostle  Paul.  In  his  letter  to  the  Christians  in  the  town  of   Colosse,  Paul  urges  them  to  keep  Christ  as  the  centre  of  their  lives.  He  writes,  "Once   you  were  alienated  from  God  and  were  enemies  in  your  minds  because  of  your  evil   behavior.  But  now  he  has  reconciled  you  by  Christ's  physical  body  through  death  to   present  you  holy  in  his  sight,  without  blemish  and  free  from  accusation--  if  you   continue  in  your  faith,  established  and  firm,  and  do  not  move  from  the  hope  held  out   in  the  gospel"  (Colossians  1:21-23).  Paul  then  goes  on  to  write  about  specific   scenarios  that  the  Christians  in  Colosse  were  facing  such  as  false  teachers,  legalism,   and  mysticism.  Paul  also  comments  on  healthy  relationships  between  slaves  and   masters,  husbands  and  wives,  and  parents  and  children  (Geisler,  1983).      John  Wesley's  sermon  based  on  Colossians  is  entitled  "On  Obedience  to  

Parents".  Wesley  begins  his  sermon  by  talking  about  the  various  interpretations  of   children  obeying  their  parents  and  how  such  obedience  may  be  displayed.  Wesley   also  cites  the  following  encouragements  from  Ephesians  6  for  children  to  obey  their   parents:  "for  it  is  right",  "this  is  acceptable  to  the  Lord"  and  "that  it  may  be  well  with   thee,  and  that  thy  days  may  be  long  in  the  land  which  the  Lord  thy  God  giveth  thee."   Wesley  then  focuses  on  what  is  meant  by  "Children,  obey  your  parents  in  all  things"   (Colossians  3:20).      First,  Wesley  endeavours  to  explain  the  intentions  behind  this  instruction.  At  

one  point,  Wesley  discusses  how  long  children  are  expected  to  obey  their  parents.   He  notes,

I  never  understood  it  so  in  my  own  case.  When  I  had  lived  upwards  of  thirty   years,  I  looked  upon  myself  to  stand  just  in  the  same  relation  to  my  father  as  I   did  when  I  was  ten  years  old.  And  when  I  was  between  forty  and  fifty,  I   judged  myself  full  as  much  obliged  to  obey  my  mother  in  everything  lawful,   as  I  did  when  I  was  in  my  leading-strings  [or  hanging-sleeve  coat]  (Wesley,   1872).      Wesley  uses  diegesis  in  this  short  narrative.  He  maintains  the  position  of  narrator  as   he  reflects  back  on  his  own  relationship  with  his  parents.  However,  he  does  let  his   congregation  be  privy  to  his  own  thoughts  that  he  was  "as  much  obliged  to  obey  my   mother  in  everything  lawful,  as  I  did  when  I  was  in  my  leading-strings  [or  hanging- sleeve  coat]".  This  short  narrative  is  the  only  one  that  Wesley  employs  in  this   sermon.  After  examining  the  fact  that  obeying  one's  parents  is  a  reflection  of   obedience  to  God,  Wesley's  message  turns  to  practical  instruction  and  advice  to  both   children  and  their  parents.  He  challenges  children  to  consider  their  submission  to   their  parents,  "Have  you  ever  considered  the  extent  of  that  obedience  to  your   parents  which  God  requires?  `Children,  obey  your  parents  in  all  things.'  No   exception,  but  of  things  unlawful.  Have  you  practised  your  duty  in  this  extent?  Did   you  ever  so  much  as  intend  it?"  (Wesley,  1872).  Wesley  also  advises  parents,  "Train   them  up  to  obedience  in  this  one  instance,  and  you  will  easily  bring  them  to  obey  in   others.  Why  should  you  not  begin  today?  Surely  you  see  what  is  the  most  excellent   way;  best  for  your  child,  and  best  for  your  own  soul"  (Wesley,  1872).      At  Granger  Community  Church,  Pastor  Jason  Miller  uses  a  very  different  

approach  when  preaching  on  Colossians  in  his  sermon  "The  Good  Life".  He  begins   his  sermon  with  a  narrative,     On  Thursday  night,  I  was  at  a  debate  at  Notre  Dame  and  it  was  a  full  house,   tickets  were  sold  out,  it  was  at  a  big  performing  arts  centre  on  campus.  The   debate  was  between  one  of  the  most  well-published,  well-known  atheists  in      49  

the  world  right  now...  On  the  other  side  of  the  debate,  we've  got  super  smart   Christian  apologist  dude...  The  question  at  hand  was  specifically,  "Is  there  a   basis  for  morality  in  a  world  without  God?"  So  if  you  can  conceive  of  a   universe  where  there  is  no  God,  is  what's  right  and  wrong  up  for  grabs  and   completely  subjective  or  can  we  come  to  some  sort  of  agreement  subjectively   if  we  don't  believe  that  God's  the  one  who  tells  us  and  teaches  us  what's  right   and  wrong?  Smart  Christian  dude  is  talking  about  moral  ontology  and  moral   epistemology  and  they're  trying  to  figure  this  out  but  at  one  point,  Christian   apologist  dude  stops  and  says,  "What  is  the  good  life?"  And  I  wanted  to  jump   up  and  say,  "Shoot,  you  don't  need  this!  Come  to  Granger  this  weekend!"  I   didn't,  though,  so  I  thought  I'd  tell  you  instead  (Miller,  2011).      Miller's  opening  story  is  effective  in  a  couple  different  ways.  First,  the  story  serves  to   capture  the  audience's  attention  with  humour  and  Miller's  enthusiasm.  Also,  this   story  leads  into  Miller's  sermon  title,  "The  Good  Life".        Miller  reminds  the  congregation  of  the  previous  week  when  "The  Good  Life"  

series  began.  In  the  previous  week,  Miller  had  discussed  that  to  live  a  good  life,   wisdom  is  needed.  This  week,  he  reminds  his  congregation,  "We  looked  at  how  God   himself  calls  on  wisdom.  We  read  in  the  Proverbs  that  wisdom  was  there  at  the  side   of  God  as  he  fashioned  the  universe  and  made  you  and  me.  And  you've  got  to  ask   yourself,  if  God  himself  requires  wisdom  to  make  something  good  then  so  do  we,   right?"      After  briefly  reviewing  the  content  of  the  previous  week's  message,  Miller  

begins  to  talk  about  vision  and  opens  this  section  of  the  sermon  with  a  story  about   his  roommate  purchasing  a  motorcycle:   I  didn't  have  interest  in  motorcycles,  I  didn't  think  it  was  something  I  would   ever  want  to  spend  my  money  on  but  that  day,  wow.  It  was  one  of  those   perfect  75  degree  sunny  days  that  we  have  in  Indiana  ­  you  know,  like  two   days  out  of  the  year  where  we're  like,  "Take  that  Florida!"  Those  kind  of  days   where  you're  just  cruising  through  the  open  country?     So  I'm  in  my  Jeep  with  the  windows  up  and  the  air  conditioning  on   and  I'm  driving  and  I'm  watching  my  buddy  experience  life  like  I've  never   seen  out  there.  Before  that  day,  I  didn't  have  any  desire  for  a  motorcycle  but  I      50  

got  a  vision  or  something  that  day  as  he's  just  cruising  and  the  wind's  just   blowing  past  him  and  he's  like  one  with  creation  and  he's  saving  money  on   gas  and  I'm  thinking,  that's  the  kind  of  life  I  want!...  Finally,  after  so  much   work,  this  vision  that  I  had  comes  to  fruition  in  my  life.  By  the  end  of  the   summer,  I'm  riding  to  work  everyday  and  it's  just  the  best  thing  in  the  world   when  you've  got  a  beautiful  sunny  gorgeous  morning  and  instead  of  getting   in  your  car,  you  get  on  your  bike  and  ride  to  work  and  you  get  seventy  miles   per  gallon  (Miller,  2011).      Miller's  story  is  an  example  of  his  use  of  mimesis  in  this  sermon.  His  extensive  story   (full  transcript  in  Appendix  B)  provides  reach  detail  of  the  scenery,  his  thought   process  when  purchasing  a  bike,  the  painstaking  practice  as  he  learns  to  ride  and  his   joy  when  he  finally  can  ride  his  motorcycle.  Miller  also  provides  further  detail  with   the  dialogue  between  himself  and  his  friend  and  also  the  conversation  between  the   man  who  delivers  his  motorcycle  and  himself.     Miller  uses  this  narrative  to  pose  the  question,  "What's  the  vision  of  the  good   life  look  like?"  He  then  reads  Colossians  1,  which  describes  Christ  as  "the  head  of  the   body,  the  church;  he  is  the  beginning  and  the  firstborn  from  among  the  dead,  so  that   in  everything  he  might  have  the  supremacy"  (Colossians  1:18).    Miller  points  out   that  all  wisdom  and  vision  needed  to  live  "the  good  life"  comes  from  Jesus  Christ.  He   then  cites  a  biblical  example  of  God-given  wisdom:   If  you've  been  with  us  for  awhile,  we've  studied  Proverbs  and  you'll  know   that  most  of  the  Proverbs  come  from  King  Solomon.  King  Solomon  was  the   wisest  man  who  ever  lived,  until  Jesus  came  around.  King  Solomon  was  the   son  of  King  David.  God  came  to  Solomon  and  said,  "What  do  you  want?   Anything  you  want  I  will  give  to  you."  Solomon  thinks  about  it  and  says,  "I   want  wisdom."  And  God,  I  think,  is  struck  by  the  profoundness  of  this  young   man  who  could  have  asked  for  anything  ­  riches,  influence,  fame,  glory  ­  and   God  is  so  impressed  by  this  that  he  says  to  Solomon,  "I'm  going  to  give  you   wisdom  and  I'm  going  to  give  you  everything  else  too"  so  he  just  pours  our   blessing  on  Solomon.  Soon  the  nation  of  Israel  is  so  renowned  that  heads  of   states  from  another  nations  come  to  consult  with  King  Solomon  to  find  out   how  it  is  that  a  leader  leads  a  nation  like  this.  This  is  the  life  of  King  Solomon,   this  is  the  wise  king  (Miller,  2011).        51  

   While  Miller  uses  dialogue  between  God  and  Solomon  in  this  story,  he  uses  diegesis   to  maintain  a  role  that  allows  him  to  inject  his  own  insights  into  the  story.  For   example,  Miller  muses  on  God's  reaction  to  Solomon's  request  for  wisdom,  "And   God,  I  think,  is  struck  by  the  profoundness  of  this  young  man  who  could  have  asked   for  anything  ­  riches,  influence,  fame,  glory".        Miller  then  contrasts  Solomon's  request  for  wisdom  early  in  his  life  to  the  

later  years,  when  he  penned  the  book  of  Ecclesiastes.  Miller  notes,  "Did  you  hear  the   exhaustion  in  Solomon's  words  in  Ecclesiastes?  He's  wasted  away.  It's  a  life  that   meant  to  be  good  but  lost  its  bearings  somewhere  along  the  way  and  it's   wearisome"  (Miller,  2011).  Miller  paraphrases  Jesus'  words  in  Matthew  11:28-30,   "Come  to  me  if  you're  weary  and  tired  of  that,  if  you're  tired  of  wasting  your   energies  and  your  efforts,  if  you're  tired  of  this  discombobulated  life  that  isn't  very   good  and  you  want  to  find  something  good.  Come  to  me  and  let  me  teach  you"   (Miller,  2011).  Miller  then  begins  another  narrative,   Awhile  ago  in  November,  I  went  to  the  Holy  Land.  We  actually  didn't  go  over   to  see  the  holy  sights,  although  we  did  see  some.  We  went  over  there  to  learn   about  the  conflicts  going  on  over  there  and  all  the  nuances  and  intricacies  of   the  difficulty  that  they're  having  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinian   territories  in  the  West  Bank  Gaza  Strip  and  the  security  concerns  and  the   religious  conflict  that's  happening  there  -  we  went  to  see  it  firsthand.  And   everywhere  you  went,  you  were  just  overwhelmed  by  the  fact  that  there  is  a   lot  here  that's  not  good...       The  first  day  we  were  there,  I  didn't  know  what  we  were  in  for.  We   were  in  this  beautiful  little  town  up  on  the  coast  and  it  was  very  tropical  and   beautiful.  Then  we  went  to  this  church  in  the  West  Bank  and  the  priest  is   over  a  church  in  the  ancient  Christian  tradition.  I  saw  a  picture  there  ­  it  was   an  icon  of  Jesus.  On  the  first  day  of  the  trip,  I  just  thought  it  was  an   interesting  picture.  I  had  no  idea  how  much  I  would  need  that  picture  the  rest   of  the  way.  Because  you're  in  this  place  where  everywhere  you  go,  you're   meeting  people  who  have  lost  their  kids  and  spouses  and  you  meet  people   who  are  very  hurt  and  broken  by  what's  happening  there.  The  churches  ­  like      52  

   Miller's  final  narrative  is  another  example  of  diegesis.  He  remains  a  present  narrator   in  the  story,  letting  his  present  reflections  of  a  past  experience  guide  the  story.  The   contrast  between  descriptions  of  the  modern  Christians  in  Israel  and  Solomon  in  his   old  age  is  striking.  Solomon  had  great  wealth  and  power  but  at  the  end  of  his  life,  he   was  depressed  and  empty.  However,  Miller  notes  that  the  Christians  in  Israel  are   "living  the  good  life"  because  they  know  Jesus  Christ.      In  their  sermons  based  on  the  book  of  Colossians,  Wesley  and  Miller  both  use  

the  Church  of  the  Nativity  ­  there  are  bullet  holes  all  over  the  side  of  the   building.  The  more  broken  I  felt,  the  more  I  wanted  to  look  at  this  picture  of   Jesus.  The  more  I  saw  broken,  devastated  lives,  the  more  I  wanted  to   remember  the  good  life  of  Jesus...   Even  though  this  was  a  war  zone,  I  saw  people  who  were  living  the   good  life  in  a  way  that  I  don't  know  if  I've  ever  lived.  And  it  was  because  they   knew  Jesus  and  they  knew  that  Jesus  was  the  way,  the  truth  and  the  life...  I   don't  want  to  wait  until  we're  living  in  a  war  zone  to  find  out  what  the  good   life  is!  And  I'm  telling  you,  the  good  life  is  Jesus  ­  it's  the  life  that  He  lived  and   the  life  that  He  lived  through  us.  

relatable  examples.  Wesley's  narratives  about  obeying  parents  and  providing  good   leadership  in  the  family  reference  a  common  life  experience.    In  the  same  way,   Miller's  stories  about  pursuing  a  goal  and  finding  happiness  are  also  relatable.  These   stories  reflect  Fisher's  declaration  that  narratives  have  "sequence  and  meaning  for   those  who  live,  create  or  interpret  them"  (Fisher,  1984,  p.2).

ANALYSIS:  SERMONS  BASED  ON  1  PETER  3  
The  final  sermon  pair  is  based  on  1  Peter  3.  1  Peter  was  a  letter  written  by  Simon   Peter,  one  of  Jesus'  disciples  (Peterson,  2002).  The  name  Peter  means  "stone"  or   "rock"  (Raymer,  1983).  This  name  seemed  unfitting  while  Jesus  was  on  earth  as   Peter  struggled  with  doubt11  and  even  denied  knowing  Jesus  three  times.12   However,  as  seen  in  both  Wesley  and  Beeson's  accounts  of  Acts  3,  Peter  provided  a   strong  foundation  for  the  church  and  preached  the  Gospel  boldly.      The  purpose  of  Peter's  letter  was  to  encourage  Christians  were  who  

experiencing  persecution.  Peter's  intention  was  to  encourage  these  Christians  and   also  exhort  them  to  live  a  holy  life  pleasing  to  God  (Raymer,  1983).        One  of  Peter's  instructions  for  holy  living  was  centred  around  dress.  He  

wrote,  "Your  beauty  should  not  come  from  outward  adornment,  such  as  elaborate   hairstyles  and  the  wearing  of  gold  jewelry  or  fine  clothes.  Rather,  it  should  be  that  of   your  inner  self,  the  unfading  beauty  of  a  gentle  and  quiet  spirit,  which  is  of  great   worth  in  God's  sight"  (1  Peter  3:3-4).  These  verses  formed  the  basis  of  John  Wesley's   sermon  entitled  "On  Dress".      Wesley  begins  his  sermon  by  discussing  the  common  question  of  why  God  

would  be  interested  in  clothing  choices  made  by  Christians.  Wesley  notes,     "But  is  it  not  strange,"  say  some,  "that  the  all-wise  Spirit  of  God  should   condescend  to  take  notice  of  such  trifles  as  these?  to  take  notice  of  such   insignificant  trifles,  things  of  so  little  moment,  or  rather  of  none  at  all?  For   what  does  it  signify,  provided  we  take  care  of  the  soul,  what  the  body  is   covered  with,  whether  with  silk  or  sackcloth?  What  harm  can  there  be  in  the   wearing  of  gold,  or  silver,  or  precious  stones,  or  any  other  of  those  beautiful                                                                                                                    11  Matthew  14:22-33   12  Mark  14:66-72      54  

  

things  with  which  God  has  so  amply  provided  us?  May  we  not  apply  to  this   what  St.  Paul  has  observed  on  another  occasion,  that  'every  creature  of  God  is   good,  and  nothing  to  be  rejected?'"  (Wesley,  1872)  

Wesley's  tactic  in  this  narrative  is  to  take  on  the  thoughts  and  feelings  that  some  of   his  congregants  may  be  feeling.  Compared  to  other  sermons  where  Wesley  is   preaching  on  living  for  Christ  wholeheartedly,  persecution,  or  relationships  within   families,  the  topic  of  clothing  may  have  seemed  trivial.  Instead  of  ignoring  these   opinions,  he  chooses  to  deal  with  them  directly  in  this  narrative.  Wesley  uses   mimesis  in  this  instance,  creating  a  complete  dialogue  around  an  imaginary  person.   After  explaining  his  motives  with  this  narrative,  Wesley  explains  that  there  are   bigger  issues  at  hand  than  simply  the  "trifles"  of  clothing  choices.  He  then  outlines   his  main  arguments  that  clothing  choices  can  lead  to  pride,  vanity,  wrong   impressions,  lust  and  lack  of  good  works.      First,  Wesley  notes  that  clothing  choices  can  become  an  area  of  pride  and  

vanity.  Wesley  warns  that  "fine  clothes  have  natural  tendency  to  make  a  man  sick  of   pride;  plain  clothes  have  not.  Although  it  is  true,  you  may  be  sick  of  pride  in  these   also,  yet  they  have  no  natural  tendency  either  to  cause  or  increase  this  sickness.   Therefore,  all  that  desire  to  be  clothed  with  humility,  abstain  from  that  poison"   (Wesley,  1872).  Wesley  also  notes  that  fine  clothing  can  make  one  vain  and  seek  out   clothing  that  will  lead  to  compliments,  praise  and  ultimately,  arrogance.      Secondly,  Wesley  warns  that  fine  clothing  can  give  others  the  wrong  

impression  of  one's  character.  He  explains,  "The  wearing  of  gay  and  costly  apparel   naturally  tends  to  beget  anger,  and  every  turbulent  and  uneasy  passion.  And  it  is  on   this  very  account  that  the  Apostle  places  this  `outward  adorning'  in  direct      55  

opposition  to  the  `ornament  of  a  meek  and  quiet  spirit'"  (Wesley,  1872).  Wesley   notes  that  while  clothing  does  not  define  character,  a  person's  appearance  should   reflect  the  expectations  that  God  has  for  a  person  living  a  holy  life.      Wesley  then  explains  that  lust  is  another  characteristic  that  does  not  belong  

in  a  holy  life.  He  says  that  fine  clothes  can  be  a  catalyst  for  lust.  Wesley  describes  the   lust  caused  by  expensive  clothing  as  "a  flame  which,  at  the  same  time,  consumes   both  yourself  and  your  admirers"  (Wesley,  1872).        Finally,  Wesley  points  out  that  expensive  clothing  requires  time  and  effort  

that  could  be  spent  completing  good  works.  In  fact,  Wesley  emphasizes  that   "wearing  costly  array  is  directly  opposite  to  the  being  adorned  with  good  works"   (Wesley,  1872)  and  considers  any  extra  money  spent  on  extravagance  is  stealing   from  God  and  the  poor.  He  continues  this  point  with  a  narrative,   Many  years  ago,  when  I  was  at  Oxford,  in  a  cold  winter's  day,  a  young  maid   (one  of  those  we  kept  at  school)  called  upon  me.  I  said,  "You  seem  half   starved.  Have  you  nothing  to  cover  you  but  that  thin  linen  gown?"  She  said,   "Sir,  this  is  all  I  have!"  I  put  my  hand  in  my  pocket;  but  found  I  had  scarce  any   money  left,  having  just  paid  away  what  I  had.  It  immediately  struck  me,  "Will   thy  Master  say,  `Well  done,  good  and  faithful  steward?'  Thou  hast  adorned   thy  walls  with  the  money  which  might  have  screened  this  poor  creature  from   the  cold!  O  justice!  O  mercy!  Are  not  these  pictures  the  blood  of  this  poor   maid?"  See  thy  expensive  apparel  in  the  same  light;  thy  gown,  hat,  head- dress!  Everything  about  thee  which  cost  more  than  Christian  duty  required   thee  to  lay  out  is  the  blood  of  the  poor!  O  be  wise  for  the  time  to  come!  Be   more  merciful!  more  faithful  to  God  and  man!  more  abundantly  adorned  (like   men  and  women  professing  godliness)  with  good  works!  (Wesley,  1872).      Wesley's  narrative  underlines  his  exhortation  to  the  congregation  to  be  generous   with  their  money.  Wesley  uses  mimesis  in  the  story  to  describe  the  conversation   between  himself  and  the  maid  but  also  to  describe  the  deep  feeling  of  guilt  that   came  over  him  when  he  realized  he  had  spent  money  on  himself  that  could  have  

  

56  

been  used  to  help  someone  in  need.  Wesley  adds  to  the  mimesis  with  descriptions  of   the  setting  ("cold  winter  day"),  the  maid's  apparel  ("thin  linen  gown")  and  the   contents  of  his  own  pocket  ("I  had  scarce  any  money  left").  The  use  of  mimesis  here   allows  Wesley  to  draw  his  congregants  into  the  situation  and  experience  it  through   his  detail.  The  feelings  experienced  by  the  audience  during  the  telling  of  the  story   also  serve  as  a  reminder  of  similar  situations  that  the  individual  congregants  have   experienced  themselves.  This  effect  leads  Wesley  to  his  point  that  instead  of   focusing  on  outward  appearance  and  dress,  Christians  must  focus  on  the  condition   of  their  relationship  with  God.      At  Granger  Community  Church,  Mark  Beeson  preached  a  message  based  on  1  

Peter  3  entitled  "The  Me  I  Want  to  Be"  on  January  16,  2011.  Beeson  takes  advantage   of  the  fact  that  New  Year's  Day  has  just  passed  and  uses  an  example  of  resolutions   when  approaching  his  title.  He  points  out  that  every  January,  people  make  common   resolutions  regarding  diet  and  health.  However,  in  order  to  meet  resolutions,  there   are  painful  steps.  Beeson  reinforces  this  idea  with  a  personal  narrative,     It  wasn't  so  long  ago  I  went  with  some  friends  and  we  climbed  Mount  Sinai.  I   should  say  my  friends  climbed  Mount  Sinai  and  they  drug  me  to  the  top.  The   only  one  of  us  who  had  ever  been  to  the  top  of  Mount  Sinai  ­  you  know   Mount  Sinai  where  God  gave  Moses  the  ten  commandments?  ­  that's  where   we  were  going,  to  the  place  where  God  gave  Moses  the  Ten  Commandments!   Where  heaven  touched  earth  and  the  miracle  of  direction  really  changed   everything.  We  were  going  to  the  top!  There  was  only  one  person  who  had   been  there  before  ­  Ron  Vandergren.  Ron  said  to  me,  "It's  a  long  way  and   what  you  should  do,  you  should  go  to  Notre  Dame  and  find  the  tallest   building  you  can  find.  And  you  should  just  run  up  and  down  the  steps  twenty,   thirty,  forty  times  everyday  for  the  next  three  months.  And  I  would  carry  a   big  heavy  pack  if  I  were  you.  Because  I've  been  there."  So  what  I  did  was  I   went  from  230  pounds  to  240  pounds  and  never  climbed  a  step  at  all.     Ron  had  been  where  we  were  going!  And  I  could  think,  "Oh  I  know.  I   went  up  a  hill  one  time,  I've  had  all  these  images  and  thoughts  about   climbing."  But  I  didn't  really  know.  He  had  been  there.  He  had  been  up  and      57  

come  back  down  and  he  was  taking  us  back  up.  He  knew  where  we  were   going.  He  knew  the  journey,  he  knew  the  path  and  he  did  his  best  to  help  me   get  there.      Beeson's  opening  narrative  is  an  example  of  diegesis.  While  Beeson  is  telling  a  story   of  a  past  event  in  his  life,  he  maintains  the  voice  of  a  narrator.  Instead  of  recreating   the  scene  where  he  is  given  advice  about  the  climb,  Beeson  tells  the  story  from  his   current  perspective.  This  employment  of  diegesis  allows  Beeson  to  keep  the  story   short  yet  meaningful  as  he  continues  into  his  sermon  material.  Beeson  emphasizes   that  in  order  to  change,  a  person  will  have  to  take  steps  to  grow  closer  to  God  and   learn  to  be  more  like  him.  Beeson  also  points  out  that  how  a  person  lives  has  an   effect  on  others,  again  providing  emphasis  with  narrative,   What  I  say  and  how  I  act  has  an  influence  on  those  that  are  following  so  I   need  to  consider  who's  following  and  then  I  need  to  be  clear  in  my  message   to  them.  If  it's  a  little  child,  I'll  speak  one  way...  if  it's  a  teenager,  I'll  speak   another  way...  if  it's  a  businessman  or  woman,  I'll  speak  another  way...  if  it's   college  students,  pastors  leading  ministries...  you  have  to  decide  who  you're   speaking  with  and  discipline  yourself  to  stay  on  message,  stay  on  target,  add   value!  Know  that  you  can  be  close  because  there  is  this  gap.  Whether  you  feel   it  or  not,  there  is  this  gap  ­  they  can't  relate  to  you,  your  employees  can't   relate  to  you,  your  students  can't  relate  to  you  ­  when  I  saw  Mrs.  Williams  at   the  grocery  store  when  I  was  in  grade  3,  I  was  shocked.  "MY  THIRD  GRADE   TEACHER  SHOPS?  SHE  SHOPS  FOR  FOOD?"  My  whole  world  came  crashing   down!  The  gap  between  me  as  a  third  grader  and  Mrs.  Williams  was  huge  and   so  she  had  to  be  careful  to  discipline  her  speech,  her  manner  to  connect  with   me  and  if  she  doesn't  take  responsibility  to  put  on  the  big  girl  pants  ­   someone  has  to  be  the  mature  person!  The  one  who  says  "I  will  tailor   carefully  my  message,  my  witness,  my  life  so  it's  helpful!  So  there  aren't  gaps   here,  so  we  are  one."        Again,  Beeson  employs  diegesis  for  this  narrative.  By  remaining  a  narrator  to  the   story,  Beeson  adds  his  own  insights  and  can  easily  transition  from  the  example  of   Mrs.  Williams  shopping  for  food  and  the  importance  of  living  and  speaking  in  a  way

that  has  a  positive  impact  on  others.  Beeson  emphasizes  the  importance  of  this   point  with  examples  of  different  groups  that  he  has  to  cater  his  message  to.  The   purpose  here  is  not  to  be  repetitive  but  instead  to  emphasize  the  importance  of   relating  to  various  groups  of  people.  The  extended  list  is  a  way  to  emphasize  his   point  and  its  importance.        Beeson  goes  on  to  discuss  the  implications  of  change  when  a  person  chooses  

to  surrender  his  or  her  life  to  God's  control.  Beeson  illustrates,   I  gave  my  life  to  Christ  after  summer  camp  in  sixth  grade.  I  came  home  and   told  my  mother  that  I'd  given  my  life  to  Jesus  Christ  and  she  said,  "Let's  go  tell   Claire."  Claire  was  my  mother's  best  friend.  So  we  jumped  in  the  car  and  went   over  to  tell  Mrs.  Devoe.  We  got  to  the  house  and  my  mom  said,  "Mark,  tell   Claire  what  you  did."  And  so  in  my  sixth  grade  joy  of  my  newfound  faith,  I   swelled  four  times  my  normal  size  and  said,  "I  gave  my  life  to  Jesus  Christ"   and  she  immediately  looked  at  me  and  said,  "Well,  that's  the  end  of  your  fun."   She  saw  me  right  then  for  who  I  was,  for  who  she'd  known  me  to  be.  She  had   trouble  picturing  me  as  the  me  I  wanted  to  be,  the  me  God  created  me  to  be.   And  all  she  knew  was,  in  her  experience  of  faith,  there  are  a  lot  of  steps  to   take  to  become  the  person  that  you  really  want  to  be.     I  want  people  to  look  at  me  and  say,  "Wow,  he's  still  got  a  long  way  to   go"  but  I  want  them  to  see  that  I've  been  with  Jesus.  The  me  I  want  to  be  isn't   way  out  there  at  some  destination,  some  final  point.  The  me  I  want  to  be  is   just  with  Jesus  ­  wherever  I  am  on  the  journey,  wherever  that  is.  I  just  want   to  be  that.  I  want  to  be  walking  with  Jesus  (Beeson,  2011).      Beeson  blends  mimetic  and  diegetic  elements  in  this  narrative.  When   describing  talking  to  his  mother,  traveling  in  the  car  and  having  a  conversation  with   Mrs.  Devoe,  Beeson  is  very  detailed  and  recreates  the  scene.  These  mimetic  details   immerse  the  listener  in  the  story.  Beeson  then  transitions  back  to  a  narrator's  role   with  his  commentary  about  Mrs.  Devoe,  "in  her  experience  of  faith,  there  are  a  lot  of   steps  to  take  to  become  the  person  that  you  really  want  to  be."  This  diegetic   transition  gives  Beeson  the  ability  to  launch  right  into  his  points  about  growth.  He   cautions  his  congregation  that  changing  to  become  more  like  Christ  will  be  a  difficult      59  

and  long  process;  however,  God  will  provide  them  with  the  strength  needed  for  the   journey.      Since  1  Peter  is  a  book  that  is  practical  and  easy  to  relate  to  (Raymer,  1983),  

it  is  fitting  that  both  Wesley  and  Beeson  use  stories  within  their  sermons  that  are   relatable.  Reader-response  theory  dictates  that  members  of  an  audience  will   interpret  a  story  according  to  their  own  experiences  and  backgrounds.  By   employing  stories  from  common,  everyday  experiences,  both  pastors  ensured  that   their  audience  could  understand  and  relate  to  the  content.    This  understanding  and   commonality  of  experience  provide  a  foundation  for  the  retention  of  the  message  of   the  sermon.

INTERPRETATION  
Through  this  study,  it  is  evident  that  both  Wesley  and  Granger  Community  Church   pastors  have  employed  extensive  examples  of  narrative  to  reinforce  the  messages  in   their  sermons.  The  natural  inclusion  of  narratives  in  the  sermons  reinforces   MacIntyre's  view  that  humans  are  natural  storytellers.  However,  stories  are  not   always  used  in  the  same  way  and  for  the  same  purpose,  as  illustrated  in  the  sermons   studied.        Wesley  employs  stories  to  better  describe  the  context  of  the  biblical  passages  

used  as  the  basis  of  his  sermons.  Wesley  uses  extensive  diegetic  narratives  and   almost  always  keeps  his  voice  as  narrator.  Wesley's  narratives  are  a  way  to  point  his   congregation  to  further  scriptural  examples.  In  the  rare  instance  that  Wesley  uses  a   personal  narrative,  the  style  is  reflective  of  the  biblical  passage.  When  direct  advice   or  encouragement  is  in  the  biblical  text,  Wesley  reinforces  it  with  a  short  story  taken   from  his  own  experience.  Moreover,  Wesley  uses  very  short,  direct  narratives.  He   uses  minimal  description  of  the  setting  and  his  use  of  dialogue  is  to  the  point.  His   narratives  always  reflect  the  biblical  text  very  closely.  The  purpose  of  his  sermons  is   to  enlighten  listeners  to  the  message  of  the  Gospel,  to  bring  the  Bible's  instructions   to  a  modern  audience  and  to  spur  listeners  to  a  life  lived  for  Christ.  As  a  result,   Wesley's  narratives  stay  true  to  the  biblical  text.  By  using  narratives  to  expound  on   the  biblical  text,  Wesley  reinforces  Fisher's  theory  that  narratives  can  provide   meaning  for  the  audience.  Also,  since  Wesley  is  urging  his  audience  to  apply  biblical   truths  and  follow  Christ,  he  is  using  narratives  in  hopes  that  they  will  aid  in  forming   his  congregants'  Christian  worldview.     

  

61  

Narratives  used  by  Granger  Community  Church  pastors  serve  a  different   purpose.  The  use  of  narrative  is  extensive  and  is  a  means  to  draw  in  the  audience.  In   all  five  of  the  sermons  analyzed,  an  entertaining  narrative  is  used  to  set  the   foundation  for  the  sermon  topic.  The  pastors  also  seem  to  employ  this  technique  to   draw  their  audience's  attention  to  the  sermon  portion  of  the  church  service  and   keep  them  engaged  in  the  message.  Similarly,  throughout  their  sermons,  the  pastors   use  creative  and  often  humourous  narratives  to  change  the  pace  of  the  sermon.   Often,  these  attention-grabbing  narratives  are  followed  directly  by  a  challenge  or   application  point.  The  placement  of  these  narratives  supports  the  assertion  that   stories  are  relatable  and  more  likely  to  be  remembered.  By  pairing  them  closely   with  the  sermon's  ultimate  message,  the  likelihood  of  remembering  and  applying   the  point  of  the  sermon  increases.        Both  Wesley  and  Granger  Community  Church  employ  narrative  in  a  way  that  

is  unusual  among  their  contemporaries.  In  the  eighteenth  century,  it  was  rare  to   hear  a  pastor  so  passionate  about  the  Gospel  of  Jesus  Christ  and  the  salvation   message  in  the  way  that  Wesley  was.  Wesley's  stories  are  formed  around  the   urgings  for  his  congregation  to  pattern  their  lives  after  Christ,  live  humbly  and   surrender  their  will  to  God.  Emily  Walker  Heady  describes  Wesley's  sermons  as   "homiletics  of  conversion"  or  "sentimental  sermons",  a  different  pattern  from  the   doctrinal  instruction  commonly  preached  from  the  pulpits  in  Wesley's  day  (Heady,   2004).     Granger  Community  Church  uses  sermon  themes  that  are  short  and   memorable.  For  example,  the  "Robin  Hood"  sermon  preached  by  Pastor  Rob  Wegner  

  

62  

was  part  of  a  series  entitled  "Soul  Flix".  The  sermons  all  opened  with  a  clip  from  a   popular  movie.  The  film  clips  in  themselves  act  as  a  narrative.  Likewise,  all  of  the   sermons  from  Granger  Community  Church  employ  creative  narrative  based  on   current  events,  personal  experiences  and  famous  stories.  These  stories  provide  a   framework  for  biblical  truth  and  are  a  tool  to  aid  the  congregation  in  remembering   and  applying  the  lesson.  Beeson  himself  attests  to  their  effectiveness:  "People  are   not  coming  to  church  to  hear  a  line-by-line  apologetic  for  their  faith.  They  don't   resonate  with  linear  postulates;  they  long  for  wisdom  wrapped  up  in  stories,  images,   and  art"  (Beeson,  2008).      The  pastors  at  Granger  Community  Church  also  use  personal  narratives  to  

establish  a  link  with  the  congregation.  With  a  congregation  of  over  5,000,  it  is   impossible  for  the  pastors  to  know  all  of  their  congregants  personally.  The  stories   derived  from  their  own  lives  are  a  way  to  establish  a  connection  with  their  audience   and  provide  a  means  to  "bind  the  facts  of  our  experience  together  into  a  coherent   pattern"  (Goldberg,  1982).  Also,  the  pastors  are  open  with  their  own  struggles  and   questions  through  their  stories.  Beeson  maintains,     Are  we  bringing  new  people  into  church  services  where  they  can  make   contact?  How  many  of  us  lob  up  a  weekly  service  new  people  can  follow?  Look   at  your  services.  Are  you  lobbing  it  up  when  you  preach?  Are  you  hoping   people  get  it?  Do  you  want  them  to  knock  the  ball  out  of  the  park,  or  are  you   hurling  knuckleballs  so  erratic  even  you  don't  know  where  they're  going?   People  are  intimidated  and  fearful  of  pastors  when  they  are  perceived  as   impressive  and  "untouchable."  Paradoxically,  people  are  impressed  by  God   when  they  realize  God  became  "touchable"  through  Christ.  People  are  awed   when  they  realize  Jesus  brought  "up  there  down  here."   Every  pastor  must  decide.  Do  I  want  people  impressed  with  Jesus  or   me?  No  one  can  pursue  both  goals.  People  will  leave  your  services  impressed   with  Jesus  or  with  you,  connecting  with  the  gospel  or  feeling  confused  and   discouraged.  Which  do  you  want?  (Beeson,  2008)  

     

63  

Beeson  and  his  pastoral  team  clearly  have  a  vision  for  pointing  people  to  Jesus   Christ.  Their  examples  of  driving  in  snowstorms,  learning  to  ride  motorcycles  and   getting  in  an  altercation  at  the  pharmacy  over  wet  wipes  show  their  purpose.  They   do  not  preach  to  draw  attention  to  themselves;  rather,  the  narratives  always  lead   into  an  application  of  following  Christ  wholeheartedly.  The  pastors'  vision  for  their   sermons  is  reflective  of  Goldberg's  stance  that  a  theologian  must  match  narratives   with  their  community's  convictions  (Goldberg,  1982).  Granger  Community  Church's   purpose  is  point  people  to  Jesus  Christ,  "someone  who  stretched  the  faith  of  those   around  Him.  He  constantly  dared  people  to  see  things  differently,  to  act  differently   and  to  live  differently"  (Granger  Community  Church,  2011).  By  drawing  in  their   audience  with  narrative  and  then  pointing  to  Christ,  the  sermons  meet  their   intended  purpose.

CONCLUSION  
Church  attendance  numbers  speak  for  themselves.  The  North  American  church  is   quickly  losing  members  and  struggling  to  find  its  voice.  In  conclusion,  I  suggest  that   this  study  of  narrative  in  sermons  contributes  to  the  conversation  in  different  ways.      First,  John  Wesley  conducted  his  ministry  in  an  innovative  way,  just  as   Granger  Community  Church  uses  creative  methods  today.  Wesley  often  preached   several  messages  a  day  and  traveled  from  town  to  town  to  deliver  his  sermons   (Christian  Ethereal  Library,  2011).  The  pastors  at  Granger  Community  Church  use   creative  themes  and  stories  to  relate  to  their  audience.  These  examples  show  that   churches  must  be  willing  to  be  innovative  and  reflect  the  preferences  of  the  culture.   Wesley  and  the  Granger  Community  Church  pastoral  team  have  succeeded  in  this   area  by  using  creative  oratory  methods.  Their  message  remains  the  Gospel,  but  their   methods  vary  from  the  norm  in  order  to  increase  effectiveness.        Secondly,  the  study  of  narrative  can  reach  further  than  these  two  examples.  It   can  extend  to  other  examples  within  the  United  Methodist  denomination.  Also,   comparisons  can  be  made  to  churches  and  pastors  from  other  denominations.  The   statistics  of  church  attendance  clearly  demonstrate  that  attendance  across  all   Christian  denominations  is  sinking.  It  is  beneficial  for  the  Christian  church  as  a   whole  learn  best  practices  from  one  another.  These  lessons  will  help  churches   conduct  services  in  a  way  that  attracts  congregants  and,  more  importantly,  inspires   them  to  live  passionately  for  Jesus  Christ.        Both  John  Wesley  and  the  pastors  at  Granger  Community  Church  provide   strong  examples  of  the  influence  of  narrative  in  creating  a  powerful    sermon.  Their   examples  make  a  positive  contribution  to  the  discussion  of  effective  sermon  tools   and,  ultimately,  the  overarching  narrative  of  the  modern  church.

APPENDIX  A   EXCERPT  FROM  "ROBIN  HOOD"  BY  ROB  WEGNER  
That  leads  me  to  a  story  called  "The  Wet  Wipe  Warmer  Incident".  My  youngest   daughter  was  born  in  December  2003  and  we  had  one  of  those  wet  wipe  warmers   and  it  functioned  well  for  our  first  two  daughters  but  a  couple  weeks  after  our   youngest  was  born,  it  just  up  and  died  on  us.  So  my  wife  sent  me  on  a  mission  to   retrieve  a  new  wet  wipe  warmer.  So  I  went  to  the  local  pharmacy,  got  in  line  where   there  was  only  one  cash  open  so  it  was  kind  of  a  long  line.  This  lady  pulls  up  behind   me  and  she  has  a  cart  full  of  Christmas  clearance  items  because  it's  about  mid- January.  She  has  dozens  of  reindeer  antlers  and  is  actually  wearing  a  pair.  She  has   chocolate  Santas,  Christmas  lights,  just  a  cart  crammed  full  of  stuff.  As  we're   standing  there,  she  asks,  "What  is  it  that  you  have  there?"  And  I'm  standing  holding   the  wet  wipe  warmer  thinking,  "This  is  going  to  be  awesome  because  I  am  a  super   dad  and  I'm  going  to  be  perceived  as  a  nurturing  dad  who  is  so  loving  to  his   newborn  baby".  So  I  turn  around  and  tell  her  it's  a  wet  wipe  warmer  and  it's  for  my   new  little  girl.  She  doesn't  look  happy  and  asks,  "Can  I  see  that?"  and  at  this  point   there  should  have  been  warning  bells  in  my  head.  But  I  hand  over  the  wet  wipe   warmer  and  she  turns  it  over  and  reads  the  back  then  hands  it  back,  locks  eyes  with   me  and  says,  "What's  that  for?"  Now  I  knew  something  was  wrong.  I've  stepped  into   some  sort  of  enemy  territory  but  I  don't  know  why  I've  offended  her  and  so  I  just   look  at  her  and  say,  "It's  a  wet  wipe  warmer,  it  warms  wet  wipes".  I  think  she   thought  I  was  being  sarcastic  but  I  swear  to  you,  I  wasn't  being  sarcastic.  And  she   launched  into  a  tirade.  She  yelled,  "That  is  the  most  obtuse,  appalling  appliance  I      66  

have  ever  seen!"  Now  it's  a  good  thing  I  didn't  know  what  "obtuse"  meant  or  I  really   would  have  been  offended.  And  I  think  she  could  tell  I  didn't  know  what  the  word   meant  so  she  began  to  explain  to  me  what  it  meant.  Now  remember,  I'm  in  a  public   space,  a  checkout  line!  And  we're  inching  forward  and  I'm  getting  closer  and  closer   to  my  turn  and  she's  talking  to  me  the  whole  time  as  I'm  holding  the  wet  wipe   warmer  walking  backwards.  And  she  begins  to  say  to  me,  "So  I  guess  Mom  can't  just   take  a  towel  and  dip  it  in  warm  water  to  wipe  the  baby's  bottom?"  And  I  was  like   "uuuuhhhh".  "And  I  bet  you  have  to  leave  it  plugged  in  all  day  everyday  and  it's  using   all  kinds  of  energy,  have  you  ever  thought  of  that?"  And  at  this  point,  I'm  in  the  front   of  the  checkout  line  and  I  look  at  the  kid  working  ­  he's  maybe  17  years  old  ­  and  he   had  this  look  of  fear  on  his  face  like  he  was  going  to  hit  the  panic  button  under  the   counter  or  something.  And  then  she  looks  at  me  and  ends  where  she  began,  "That  is   the  most  obtuse  appliance  I  have  ever  seen!"  And  then  there  was  this  pause  and   everyone  in  line  was  watching  and  it  was  my  moment  to  have  a  clever,  cunning   comeback  so  I  looked  at  her  and  I  said,  "Uhh,  it's  a  wet  wipe  warmer."  I  couldn't   think  of  anything  else  to  say!  I  was  so  discombobulated  that  I  was  being  mocked  by   a  stranger  and  she  was  just  laying  into  me  and  I  don't  know  why.  I  got  into  the  car   and  it  wasn't  until  then  that  the  irony  of  this  woman  reaming  me  out  about  an   obtuse  appliance  and  the  whole  time,  she  has  a  pair  of  fake  reindeer  antlers  on!     With  a  price  tag  hanging  from  it!  And  on  the  way  home,  I  came  up  with  ten  awesome   comebacks  which  I  keep  in  my  pocket  in  case  I  see  that  woman  again.  But  on  the   way  home,  I  thought,  "Wow,  she  wanted  a  fight."  And  it  almost  didn't  matter  who  it   was.

APPENDIX  B   EXCERPT  FROM  "THE  GOOD  LIFE"  BY  JASON  MILLER  
A  few  years  ago,  one  of  my  roommates  decided  that  it  was  time  to  get  a  motorcycle.   He  had  grown  up  around  motorcycles,  his  dad  had  a  motorcycle  and  it  was  time  for   him  to  get  a  motorcycle.  So  my  buddy  saves  up  his  money,  does  some  online   shopping  and  he  finds  the  perfect  starter  bike  for  him.  So  after  he  saves  up  his   money  and  he  orders  it  and  has  it  shipped  to  his  dad's  house  about  an  hour  away   from  where  we  live  ­  about  an  hour  out  in  the  country.  So  the  big  day  comes  and  my   buddy  gets  his  bike  delivered  to  his  dad's  house  and  I'm  just  trying  to  be  helpful  so   we  jump  in  my  car  and  drive  to  his  dad's  house  about  an  hour  away  so  he  can  pick   up  his  bike  and  he  can  drive  it  back  to  the  house.  Now  I've  got  to  tell  you  guys  ­  I   didn't  have  interest  in  motorcycles,  I  didn't  think  it  was  something  I  would  ever   want  to  spend  my  money  on  but  that  day,  wow.  It  was  one  of  those  perfect  75   degree  sunny  days  that  we  have  in  Indiana  ­  you  know,  like  two  days  out  of  the  year   where  we're  like,  "Take  that  Florida!"  Those  kind  of  days  where  you're  just  cruising   through  the  open  country?  And  I'm  in  my  Jeep  with  the  windows  up  and  the  air   conditioning  on  and  I'm  driving  and  I'm  watching  my  buddy  experience  life  like  I've   never  seen  out  there.  Before  that  day,  I  didn't  have  any  desire  for  a  motorcycle  but  I   got  a  vision  or  something  that  day  as  he's  just  cruising  and  the  wind's  just  blowing   past  him  and  he's  like  one  with  creation  and  he's  saving  money  on  gas  and  I'm   thinking,  that's  the  kind  of  life  I  want!  So  out  of  nowhere,  I  get  this  vision  that  I  want   a  motorcycle  and  I  start  saving  up  my  money  and  I  learn  all  the  stuff  they  teach  you   in  the  little  book  so  you  can  get  your  learner's  permit.  I  find  my  bike,  I  order  it  online      68  

and  it's  getting  shipped  to  my  house.  A  few  weeks  later,  the  guy's  who's  driving  the   semi-truck  and  delivering  my  bike  calls  and  goes,  "Hey!  I'm  going  to  be  in  your  neck   of  the  woods  tomorrow,  you  ready  for  your  bike?"  and  I'm  like,  "Do  you  have  any   idea?  Uh,  yeah!"  So  the  next  day,  I'm  just  bouncing  off  the  walls  in  my  house  waiting   for  the  guy  in  the  semi-truck  to  bring  my  motorcycle  to  me  and  I  can  finally  take   hold  of  this  vision  that  I  had  when  I  saw  my  buddy  driving  on  the  open  road.  So  he   called  and  said,  "Hey  I'm  pulling  up  man!"  and  the  thing  about  my  neighbourhood  is   I  live  in  one  of  those  really  narrow  sidestreets  that  intersects  a  big  street  so  he   realizes  he's  not  going  to  be  able  to  get  his  semi  down  the  little  side  street  so  he   parks  it  on  the  big  street  which  is  by  my  house  but  not  in  front  of  my  house  ­  maybe   about  200  yards  away.  So  I  run  out  and  semi-truck  driver  dude  comes  out  and  opens   up  the  back  hatch  of  the  semi,  uses  this  little  lift  to  go  up  into  the  truck  and  get  the   motorcycle,  and  wheels  it  out  on  to  the  lift  and  lowers  it  down  to  the  ground.  It's   another  one  of  those  beautiful  75  degree  sunny  days  and  I'm  standing  there  just   looking  at  this  masterpiece  enamored,  in  love.  Piano-player  boy  finally  found  his   testosterone,  I've  got  my  motorcycle  and  I'm  so  excited.  So  I'm  having  a  moment  and   the  motorcycle  is  glistening  in  the  sunlight  and  I'm  totally  enraptured  with  this   beautiful  bike  that's  sitting  right  in  front  of  me  and  the  guy  says,  "Go  ahead  and  start   it  up  to  make  sure  that  everything's  okay."  But  I  just  completely  tune  him  out   because  I'm  having  a  moment.  And  he  says  it  again,  "Go  ahead  and  start  it  up  to   make  sure  that  everything's  okay"  and  I'm  still  ignoring  him  because  I'm  still  having   my  moment.  He  says  it  a  third  time  and  the  real  story  is  that  I  don't  know  how  to   start  a  motorcycle.  I  figure  I'm  not  going  to  get  out  of  this  one  without  `fessing  up  so  

  

69  

I  tell  the  guy  "I  don't  really  know  how  to  start  a  motorcycle.  So  the  guy  just  kind  of   snorts  and  starts  the  bike  for  me  at  which  point,  I  realize  this  would  have  all  been   great  if  he  could  have  pulled  up  in  front  of  my  house.  He  turns  to  me  and  says,  "I   suppose  you  need  me  to  put  this  in  your  garage  for  you  too,  right?"  So  he  rolls  my   bike  in  the  garage  and  my  little  balloon  of  masculinity  that  got  inflated  popped   pretty  fast.  So  then  the  bike's  in  my  garage  and  I'm  just  waiting  for  my  buddy  to  get   home  so  he  could  teach  me  what  I  was  doing.  Did  you  know  that  they  give  you  a   learner's  permit  without  knowing  if  you  know  anything  about  riding  a  motorcycle?   Does  anybody  else  think  that's  stupid?  I  do!  Motorcycles  aren't  like  cars  where  you   have  your  parent  in  the  seat  next  to  you  while  you're  driving  down  the  open  road.   Anyway,  my  buddy  finally  gets  home,  we  go  into  the  garage,  get  my  bike  and  put  it   out  on  the  road  in  front  of  my  house.  We  decided  we're  going  to  take  it  really,  really   slow  and  really,  really  easy  and  put  the  bike  in  first  gear  and  let  it  idle  a  little  bit.  You   can  just  feel  what  it's  like  and  start  feeling  your  bearings  on  this  thing.  It  starts  to   idle  a  little  bit  faster  and  at  this  point,  I  want  to  do  something.  Does  anybody  here   know  how  on  a  motorcycle,  your  hands  control  both  the  brake  and  the  gas?  I  happen   to  be  on  a  road  that's  lined  very  narrowly  on  both  sides  with  vehicles  and  I'm  on  the   motorcycle  going  "Brake,  brake!"  and  my  hand  goes  "THROTTLE!"  I  got  about  six   inches  from  just  plowing  into  a  car  on  the  side  of  the  street.  At  this  point,  let's  put   the  bike  back  in  the  garage  for  now.  We  scheme  a  little  bit  and  figure  out  that  we   need  a  large  wide  open  parking  lot  that's  safe  for  all  this  kind  of  stuff  like  perhaps   the  parking  lot  at  Granger  Community  Church.  So  my  buddy  drives  the  bike  and  I   follow  him  in  my  car  up  here  to  the  church  and  we  do  some  practices  in  the  lot.  We  

  

70  

do  first  gear  around  the  lot  for  awhile  and  then  first  gear  turns  into  second  gear  and   I'm  not  going  to  tell  you  where  but  we  hid  the  bike  for  about  two  weeks  right  here   on  the  property  so  during  my  lunch  break,  I  could  take  my  little  bike  around  the   parking  lot  in  first  gear  and  do  some  laps.  Eventually  I  got  gutsy  enough  that  I  tried   some  of  the  streets  just  around  the  perimeter  of  the  church  here  and  do  like  a  lap  or   two.  Finally,  after  so  much  work,  this  vision  that  I  had  comes  to  fruition  in  my  life.   By  the  end  of  the  summer,  I'm  riding  to  work  everyday  and  it's  just  the  best  thing  in   the  world  when  you've  got  a  beautiful  sunny  gorgeous  morning  and  instead  of   getting  in  your  car,  you  get  on  your  bike  and  ride  to  work  and  you  get  seventy  miles   per  gallon.
