Abstract

A QUASI-2D FINITE ELEMENT FORMULATION OF ACTIVE

CONSTRAINED-LAYER FUNCTIONALLY GRADED BEAM
© Elena Miroshnichenko, 2007 Master of Applied Science in the program of Mechanical Engineering Ryerson University

A functionally graded (FG) beam with an active constrained-layer damping (ACLD) treatment is modeled and analyzed. ACLD consists of a passive element, in the form of a viscoelastic layer bonded to the host structure, and an active constraining element which is represented by a piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) laminate. It is assumed in the current formulation that the field variables are expressible as polynomials through the thickness of the beam and are cubically interpolated across the span. Hamilton's principle is used in the derivation of the equations of motion, which are solved using the Newmark time-integration method. The versatility of the formulation is demonstrated using different support mechanisms in the form of analysis of cantilevered, fixed-end partially-constrained and simply-supported beam cases. The effects of ply orientation in the PFRC laminate and varying elastic modulus in the FG beam are also examined.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Mechanical vibration and noise reduction is a crucial issue in many engineering systems, ranging from simple mechanism such as automobile parts to large-scale structures such as airplanes and spacecrafts. It is especially a concern in lightweight structures, wherein weight addition is not an option for suppressing vibration. Successful reduction of noise and vibration results in a higher performance and durability of the machines and structures, as well as creating an improved living/working environment. A considerable amount of research has been done over the years with regard to the modeling and control of lightweight composite structures [1-3]. One of the most widely used conventional methods for suppressing vibrations and noise involves the addition of damping by bonding a viscoelastic layer to the host structure. This technique can be enhanced by the addition of an active element in the form of a piezoelectric material attached to the structure. The resulting configuration is known as 'smart' or 'intelligent' structure and it is emerging as a promising active-damping technique. Direct and inverse effects of the piezoelectric materials allow them to be used in structural applications as sensors and actuators, respectively. The analysis of such structures requires accurate modeling that takes into account the electromechanical coupling of the structure. As observed by Stanway et al. [1], piezoelectric sensors and actuators are widely used in vibration and noise control of smart structures because of their excellent frequency characteristics and capability in reciprocal conversion between the electric and mechanical strain energy. The assumptions which support the classical three-layer theory [4-7] are: I) the host beam and the constraining layer deform as Euler-Bernoulli beams, that is, plane cross sections remain plane and perpendicular to the deflection curve of the deformed beam, 2) the viscoelastic core behaves as a Timoshenko beam and, consequently, shears, 3) the axial displacement field in each layer is linear through the thickness and the transverse displacement is constant throughout the thickness, 4) the core supports only shear load, 5) perfect bonding exists at the interfaces and no slip occurs between the layers, 6) in-plane inertia effects are ignored, and 7) small-displacement theory is used. To improve the model, one has to consider shear and longitudinal energy contributions of all three layers

and, consequently, allow for shear deformations in the facings and normal direct deformations in the core. The current formulation is based on a Timoshenko beam theory for each layer; however, for sufficiently thin beams it also captures the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis. The present work extends the use of the quasi-two-dimensional finite element model developed by Bekuit [8] for the vibration analysis. In [8], the author assumed cubic axial deformation and quadratic transverse deformation along the thickness direction of the core only. As in [8], at each node of current formulation, through-the-thickness integration of field variables is carried out analytically, thus reducing what would have been a two-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional finite element procedure. Thereafter, a Gaussian quadrature is used to numerically integrate over the span for each element. This greatly increases efficiency of the computer program and saves computational time. However, unlike in Bekuit's three-layer model [8], both the host beam and middle layer axial displacements are modeled as cubic functions, while transverse displacements are quadratic functions with respect to z. The top layer employs a linear interpolation of the axial displacements and constant transverse displacement, as is common for the three-layer theory mentioned above. The "quasi" concept follows Nabarrete et al. [9] who developed a quasi-three-dimensional finite element formulation, where in-plane displacement characteristics are modeled after the bicubic trial functions and are interpolated through the thickness. This thesis is concerned with utilizing the aforementioned active-passive damping technique in a three-layer quasi-two-dimensional finite element beam model. The beam is made of a functionally graded material (FGM). A viscoelastic material is sandwiched between the beam and a piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) laminate constraining layer. The properties of these materials are discussed in Chapter two. The passive and active methods for controlling noise and vibration are presented in greater detail in the next section. In Chapter three, the mathematical formulation of the current quasi-two-dimensional beam model is presented. This includes the description of the system, kinematic assumptions, and constitutive equations. Chapter four discusses the process of developing a finite element model. The extended Hamilton's principle is used to derive the equation of motion, which is solved using the Newmark time-integration

2

method. The fifth chapter presents simulation results, and concluding remarks and suggestions for the future work are discussed in Chapter six.

1.1 Active Constrained-Layer Damping (ACLD)
The desire to reduce weight in machines and structures for economic benefits increases the need for vibration control of these structures. Their excitation responses are dominated by resonant modes that occur at low natural frequencies. These low frequency vibrations are difficult to control using conventional technologies, which are mainly passive and effective for high frequency vibration suppression. In these structures, a viscoelastic layer is often bonded to the host structure to increase the dissipation of energy. Viscoelastic materials contain long-chain molecules, which are effective at converting mechanical energy into heat under deformation [1]. When a second layer of metallic material is bonded on top of the viscoelastic layer, then a certain type of treatment is produced and is known as a passive constrained-layer damping (PCLD) treatment [1,2]. Stanway et al. [1] discussed the progression from such treatment to what is now known as active constrained-layer damping (ACLD), where a piezoelectric layer acts as the constraining layer. ACLD treatments significantly increase performance by enabling vibration control at low frequencies. With this upgrade from PCLD to ACLD, vibration control is possible at both the high modes due to the passive element and low modes due to active element. The components of ACLD complement each other in that the active elements allow structures to adapt to a changing environment and remain within weight and size constraints, while the passive elements provide a fail-safe control mechanism [1-3, 10-11]. Furthermore, these performance benefits are achieved without much consequence in terms of cost, weight and complexity. The passive element, in the form of a viscoelastic damping layer added to one of the surfaces of the host structure, is subjected to both direct and shear strains upon the deformation of the beam. The damping layer is introduced to exploit the ability of one of the strains, mostly shear strain, to dissipate energy at particular areas [1]. The active element involves an actuator, usually in the form of a piezoelectric layer, which can increase the beam's deformation and thus enhance the damping capability of the viscoelastic layer. In [1], Stanway et al. emphasized practical applications in terms of

3

structural elements utilized in ACLD, other than the most common application to cantilevered beam. They also presented various actuator and sensor configurations that have been investigated by other researchers. The development of some modeling and control techniques were also discussed. Trindade et al. [2] similarly described various hybrid vibration damping treatments, modeling approaches and control algorithms used in the literature. A thorough comparative analysis has been done regarding the different hybrid active-passive damping configurations that already exist in literature. However, the authors presented all configurations known to the research world without distinguishing between the proposed simulated and experimentally investigated options. Balamurugan and Narayanan [3] highlighted the aforementioned advantages of the ACLD treatment in their development of a beam finite element model that has been partially covered with the constrained layer. Further, Gao et al. [10] analyzed a simplysupported beam using enhanced self-sensing ACL treatment that comprises edge elements connected to both host structure and piezoelectric layer for the purpose of transmissibility between actuator and sensor.

1.2 Piezoelectric Element as Actuator and Sensor
An advantage of the piezoelectric element that must be mentioned is its dual nature in being able to act as both an actuator and sensor. A piezoelectric element is able to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. The direct effect is defined as the generation of an electric charge in proportion to an applied force/pressure. The inverse effect, however, is the opposite and induces an expansion (contraction) of the piezoelectric ceramic/polymer under an applied electric field parallel to the polarization direction. Hence, this benefit results in a simplified ACLD configuration due to the piezoelectric element's dual nature as a 'self-sensing' actuator, whereby sensor and actuator are truly collocated, thus removing chances of instability [1, 2, 10]. Another configuration was noted by Stanway et al. [1] and Trindade et al. [2], which consisted only of the elastic beam with the viscoelastic core, the constraining layer in the form of a piezoelectric actuator and the sensor bonded beside the treatment. This results in the reduction of the structure to three layers. An ACLD arrangement that is used in this thesis work closely resembles this configuration presented in both [1] and [2],

4

where the piezoelectric element acts as an actuator while a sensor/accelerometer provides the input signal to the controller/amplifier of the system, which, in tum, sends the signal to excite the piezoelectric actuator. A schematic of the configuration is shown in Fig. 1.1 below.

Further simplification of this arrangement will result in the sensor/accelerometer being removed and the self-sensing piezoelectric actuator implemented, as was mentioned in the previous paragraph. Many theoretical models have been proposed to describe the interaction between piezoelectric materials and host structures. Among them, Crawley and de Luis [12] introduced the fundamental concepts of using piezoelectric materials as actuators and sensors in 'intelligent' structures. Their paper also presented static and dynamic models of distributed piezoelectric actuators. From the amount of literature surveyed for this thesis, it is evident that a flurry of research activity continues to go on, validating the concept of intelligent structures, quantifying the effects of piezoelectric sensors and actuators, and analyzing the true feasibility of intelligent structures.

Chapter 2 Materials
As was mentioned in the preceding chapter, the system of interest consists of the host beam, made of FGM, with a bonded viscoelastic layer which is covered with piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC). The use of this combination of materials results in a strong, lightweight structure that is suitable for active control. The following describes each material and its properties.

2.1 Functionally Graded Material (FGM)
FGMs have recently emerged as a new class of materials that exhibit gradual spatial variation of material properties. Unlike laminated composites, they do not possess distinct interfaces across which properties abruptly change. In the case of laminates, the sudden change in properties causes large interlaminar shear stresses, which may give rise to delamination in the structure [13]. Such damage can be avoided if the properties vary smoothly across the thickness, as in the case of FGM. During the past decade, this class of materials has been investigated by many researchers. Sankar [14], for instance, developed an exact elasticity solution for functionally graded (FG) beams subjected to transverse loads, where Young's modulus was assumed to vary exponentially through the thickness and the Poisson ratio was constant. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory was adapted to FGM beams and compared to the elasticity solutions. This was later extended by Sankar and Tzeng [15] by including a thermal gradient across the thickness of the beam. The authors were able to achieve a reduction in residual thermal stresses when the variation of thermoelastic constants was opposite in direction to that of the temperature distribution. Ray and Sachade [13, 16] derived the exact solutions for the simply-supported FG plates with integrated layers of PFRC. They also developed a finite element model for the same composite plate. Liew et al. [17] also developed a finite element formulation for static and dynamic analysis and control of FGM plates subjected to a temperature gradient. The authors based their model on a first-order shear deformation theory to actively control FGM plates using distributed piezoelectric sensor/actuator pairs.

6

In this thesis, the Poisson ratio v is assumed to be constant because the effect of variation of Poisson's ratio on the deformation is much less than that of Young's modulus [18]. However, Young's modulus varies continuously through the thickness of the beam
(z - axis), i.e., E = E(z) , according to the volume fraction of constituents defined by an

exponential function. In [18], the exponential function was given as:

(2.1)

where the functional material gradient is given as A = l};ln(Et! E 2); E1 and E2 are the Young's moduli ofthe bottom (z = h/2) and top surfaces (z respectively; and h is the thickness of the plate.

= -h/2) of the FGM plate,

2.2 Viscoelastic Material
As noted in the previous chapter, viscoelastic materials are often incorporated into structures to increase passive damping and largely reduce structural vibrations and noise. There are also a number of techniques associated with modeling a viscoelastic solid, which has a weak frequency dependence on its dynamic properties over an extensive frequency range [19]. Therefore, it is important to accurately describe the frequency dependence of the viscoelastic material. For instance, the frequency band chosen for applying the curve fitting technique of master curves can be the transition band or the region of maximum loss factor [20]. However, to use this technique, a number of additional material parameters are introduced, thus increasing computational effort. Some of the methods suggested for time-domain analysis of viscoelastic structures include the anelastic displacement fields (ADF) and Golla-Hughes-McTavish (GHM) models [3,20, 21]. The Prony series is a classical time-based technique for fitting creep or relaxation data in the form of exponential functions and is compared to a fractional derivative model in [22]. The fractional derivative model is another time-domain method which is based on fractional calculus. In order to use more traditional Kelvin and Maxwell-based models, more parameters are required to represent viscoelastic material behavior than in the

7

fractional model [22]. The fractional derivative model, however, is not common in commercial finite element codes which mainly use the Prony series method. One of the widely used fractional derivative methods is the four-parameter model, a dissipation model based on memory mechanism. Caputo and Mainardi developed the model for hysteretic response of metallic materials by generalizing the integer order derivatives in the standard solid model to fractional order [22]. This method has been successful in describing the weak frequency dependence mentioned above. The only disadvantage associated with using fractional derivative models is the added mathematical complexity of applying fractional calculus. However, it becomes relatively simple once the Fourier transform of the fractional derivative constitutive equation is taken and the expression of the elastic complex modulus in the frequency domain of OJ is obtained as [19]:
E*(OJ) = E'(OJ) + iE"(OJ)
(2.2)

where E'(OJ) and E"(OJ) are the storage and loss moduli, respectively, which can be used to plot and compare master curves to the experimental results. In the study by Galucio et al. [19], the complex modulus for the one-dimensional model is shown as:
E*(OJ)

= o-*(OJ) = Eo + E",(iOJrY
&* (OJ)

1+ (iOJrt

(2.3)

where

0-*

and

&*

are the Fourier transforms of o-(t) and &(t), respectively; Eo

represents the static modulus of elasticity or E* at OJ ---+ 0; Eoo is the dynamic modulus or
E* at OJ ---+ 00; r is the relaxation time; and a is the fractional derivative order. To

satisfy the second law of thermodynamics, conditions such as: 0 < a < 1, r > 0 and
Eoc > Eo must hold true.

2.3 Piezoelectric Fiber-Reinforced Composite (PFRC)
As mentioned in Chapter one, piezoelectric materials have been widely used as sensors and/or actuators when integrated into a high-performance lightweight smart structure to actively control its vibration. The performance of such structures highly depends on the magnitude of the piezoelectric stress/strain coefficients, which are quite low for the monolithic piezoelectric materials [23, 24]. Therefore, a significant amount of control voltage must be used to achieve a considerable amount of active damping. To avoid this, the piezoelectric stress/strain properties must be modified to further improve the damping characteristics of the smart structures [25]. Piezoelectric composites are effective in improving flexural vibration control if their fibers are orientated longitudinally to render a bending mode of actuators. It is also practical to apply a constant electric field across the thickness of the composite, that is, in a direction transverse to the fiber direction. The schematic diagram of a lamina of PFRC, which depicts a representative volume that includes both fiber and matrix, is shown in Fig. 2.1 [25].

Recent investigations carried out regarding the implementation of PFRC in the lightweight high-performance flexible structures included the work of Ray and Mallik [23], and Ray and Sachade [16]. The earlier work by Mallik and Ray [25] showed that the effective PFRC coefficients are significantly larger than the corresponding piezoelectric material coefficients. Based on a certain fiber volume fraction, they were able to determine these effective coefficients of PFRC using a micromechanical analysis, which will not be discussed in this thesis.

piezoceramics, such as lead-zirconate titanate (PZT), will be used for the role of actuator in the PFRC laminate layer. This material is usually polarized in the thickness direction and exhibits transversely isotropic properties in the xy-plane [26]. The authors in [23] developed a finite element model of the smart structure coupled with the patches of ACLD treatment. The active damping performance of PFRC layer has been researched for thin symmetric and anti-symmetric cross-ply, and anti-symmetric angle-ply laminated composite plates. The effect of variation of fiber orientation in the PFRC layer on the damping characteristics has been investigated and the fiber angle for which the control authority of the PFRC layer is maximum has also been determined. In [16], Ray and Sachade derived the exact solutions for the static analysis of FG plates integrated with a layer of PFRC material. They concluded that the activated PFRC layer is more effective in controlling vibration of the plates when it is attached to the surface of the FG plate of minimum stiffness rather than to that of maximum stiffness. The constitutive equations including the inverse and direct piezoelectric effects of the PFRC layer, respectively, with respect to xyz (geometric) coordinates will be used in the following chapter and are given as [27]:

{D}, {E}, {c} and {O"} are the electric displacement, electric field, strain and

Chapter 3 Theoretical Formulation
3.1 System Description
The system of interest is a rectangular cross-sectioned three-layer composite beam. The host beam is made of FGM with varying modulus of elasticity. The beam is bonded to a viscoelastic layer, which, in tum, is covered with a PFRC laminate layer, as illustrated in Fig. 3.1. The ACLD configuration in this thesis is adopted from the work of Stanway et al. [1] and Trindade et al. [2], as was mentioned in Chapter one. Fig. 3.1 shows a segment of the span (1) that is fully treated with the active-passive constraining layer and segment (2) which represents only the host beam. The geometrical parameters of the beam are length L, width b , host beam height
hb' core height he' and top layer height h p . The mid-surface (z = 0) of the composite

beam structure is at

1-

distance away from the bottom of the beam, where

h = hh + he + hp . The material properties of each layer are density p, Young's modulus

of elasticity E, and Poisson's ratio v. The layers are assumed to have perfect bonding at the interfaces, and the adhesive material is thin with infinite stiffness.

3.2.2 Constitutive Equations
For an orthotropic FGM where the principal material directions coincide with the
x and z axes, the two dimensional stress-strain constitutive relations are:

(3.5)

where

CIt

and

Cle

represent the normal stress in the x and z directions, respectively, and
Cij

rc is the shear stress in the xz plane. Given that the elastic stiffness coefficient

varies exponentially in the z direction, the elasticity matrix may be written as:

where

[cn

the beam and A is a parameter describing the inhomogeneity of the FGM across the thickness.

If it is further assumed that the FGM is isotropic at every point and Poisson's ratio is a constant through the thickness, then the variation of Young's modulus is given by
E(z)
=

E~eA(e+h!2) with the functional gradient A =

In (EU En, where E~ and E~

correspond to the Young's moduli of the bottom and top surfaces of the FGM layer, respectively. Consequently, the elasticity matrix [c~J is related to the Young's modulus

E~ and Poisson's ratio

3.2.3 Formulation using Variational Principle

(3.9)

5Tb + 5r; + 5Tp and 5U = 5U b + 5U, + 5U p are the variations of the kinetic

3.3 Viscoelastic Layer (Core)
The core, or the middle layer, is made of viscoelastic material and is distinguished by the subscript c.

Viscoelastic Properties
As mentioned previously in Chapter two, the behavior of the viscoelastic material at a given time depends not only on a current state of stress or strain, but also on the material's history. This behavior is mathematically described by Galucio et al. in [19] by a four-parameter fractional derivative model as:

(3.25)

This variable change reduced the number of fractional derivative terms from two to one, thus simplifying the equation.

Using the Grunwald approximation from Eq. (3.22) with Al et al. [19] show that Eq. (3.25) takes the following form:

= I at j = 0, Galucio

(3.26)

where the dimensionless constant 17

20

To be consistent with the typical fonn of a compact matrix notation taken for the strain vector of the FGM beam, a fictitious anelastic displacement vector

{u, (t)}, which

depends on the displacement history, is defined such that the anelastic strain can be written as:

(3.27)

Following Galucio et al. [19], and substituting for &,(t) from Eq. (3.18) and i,(t) from
Eq. (3.27) at a given time t into Eq. (3.26), the displacement

{u, (t)} is expressed as:

Rearranging Eq. (3.24) for

a, (t)

yields:

(3.29)

Replacing ((t) in Eq. (3.29) with Eq. (3.26) results in the updated expression of ac(t) at a given time t:

(3.30)

For an elastic material, '7 == 0 and Eo == Ec and Eq. (3.30) is reduced to

a, (t) == Eo [,] &c (t) == [Q,] &, (t) . Hence, the constitutive relation of the viscoelastic core
IS:

Substituting for &c from Eq. (3.18) yields:

where the elastic stiffness matrix

Similarly, the variation of anelastic strain energy SUc(t) is expresses as:
(3.38)

where the anelastic stiffness matrix [ C c ] is given by:

3.4 PFRC Laminate (Top Layer)
The PFRC laminate, or the top layer, is made of piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite, as previously explained in Chapter two, and is identified by the subscript p . The piezoelectric fibers in PFRC are considered to act as the actuator of the beam. The fibers in each PFRC ply are horizontally reinforced and are aligned at orientation angle

e with respect to the reference plane. There are n

number of plies in the laminate.

3.4.1 Kinematic Assumptions Mechanical Field Assumptions
Here, unlike in the preceding subsections, the axial displacement is linearly interpolated through the thickness and the transverse displacement is constant. The displacement vector up' with the coefficients eo' el , and no as functions of the spatial variable x and temporal variable t, is of the form:

24

Up ={U(X,Z,I)}={eo+elz} w(x,z,t) no

(3.40)

Defining a new vector {Up

{eo e1 no} yields the modified up vector:

The strain vector c p takes the following form:

(3.43)

The above equation is then converted into the following matrix notation:

(3.44)

where the derivative operator matrices [D~

] and [D~ ] are expressed as:

25

Electrical Field Assumptions
Two electrostatic assumptions are consideration for the PFRC laminate. First, the electrical potential variable If/p is assumed linear within the thickness of the top layer and is of the following form:

(3.45)

where If/o and 8lf/p are the electric potential and its gradient at the mid-plane of the 8z PFRC laminate, respectively.

Second, the axial component of the electrical field is ignored (i.e., Ex

=

0), since

its contribution to the electromechanical energy is negligible in comparison with that of the transverse component [20]. Also, since the thickness of the PFRC laminate is relatively thin, the voltage is assumed to be uniformly distributed through the thickness along the z direction. Considering the above, the expression of the transverse component of the electrical field Eo then represents a constant field along the z axis as follows:

E =---p =
=

81f/

V
hp

8z

(3.46)

where V is the applied voltage in the beam and hp is the thickness of the PFRC laminate.

26

3.4.2 Constitutive Equations
The piezoelectric fibers are continuous and longitudinal (x - axis) and subjected to a constant electric field acting in the direction transverse to the fiber direction or along the z axis, as was mentioned in the previous subsection. Note that the electric field is assumed to be the same in both the fibers and the surrounding matrix, where the matrix material is piezoelectrically inactive [25].

Mechanical Properties
The piezoelectric fibers are transversely isotropic in the 1-2 plane [26] and the constitutive relation for the PFRC in the principal 1-2-3 directions is of the following form:

[25] at constant electric field; the constants eij denote piezoelectric coefficients; and E; represents the electric field.

As the piezoelectric fibers are orientated longitudinally in the 1-2 plane, the transformation from the 1-2-3 coordinate system to a global xyz system must be performed through a counterclockwise rotation by an angle () about the z axis. The transformation matrix of trigonometric functions of the mechanical aspect is written as [29, 30]:

3.4.2.1 Laminate Stiffness Matrix ABD
Mechanical
Using the classical lamination theory [29, 30], the resultant laminate stiffness matrix ABD can be determined by computing the force and moment resultants at the xcoordinate on the laminate reference plane (middle of the laminate). See Fig. 3.2 below for the geometry of an n -layered laminate. The resultant forces and moments acting on the laminate are obtained by integrating the stresses and moments of the stresses in each ply through the thickness of the laminate [29, 30].

Since the stiffness matrix from Eq. 3.53 does not depend on z, that is, it is constant within each ply of the PFRC laminate, then the stiffness matrix can be placed outside the integration over each ply and still be within the summation of force and moment resultants of each layer. In addition, the strain vector { of

from Eq. 3.44 is not a function

but is a middle surface value and, thus, can be removed from under both the

integration and summation signs. Taking the above operations [29, 30] into an account and substituting the lamina constitutive relation from Eq. 3.53, the force and moment resultants can be expressed in the following matrix notation:

which show the relation between the stress and the electric field in the PFRC laminate.

Figure 4.1: Schematic of a finite element

The element consists of four nodes along the span to allow for a cubic Lagrange interpolation of the field variable [32]. Each nodal variable, however, is also interpolated through the thickness with a cubic function for axial displacement and a quadratic function for transverse displacement in the host and viscoelastic layers, and a linear function for axial displacement in the PFRC laminate. As a result, ten points are selected through the thickness for each node, and they are denoted by hI' h2 ··· , h1o · These points are located relative to the geometric mid-surface of the composite beam structure at
z =0.

The global displacement vector of an element is given as:
(4.1)

39

where

Ui

and

Wi

are the axial and transverse displacement magnitudes, respectively,

evaluated at the i 'h position through the thickness.

From the above, it is determined that each node contains 13 degrees of freedom (DOF), resulting in 52 DOF for each element. Hence, the elemental displacement vector

qe can be written as:

where the index i = 1... 10 represents the displacement occurring through the thickness and the index j

In other words, to perform finite element analysis, the element of length over which the integration is carried out along the x - axis needs to be expressed in terms of the local coordinate .; with an appropriate change of limits of integration ( - 1 and 1) [33]. The same process is followed in formulating the stiffness matrix by substituting

(4.34)

The positions, .;;, and weight coefficients, H;, of the Gaussian quadrature are given in [33]. The integrals from Eqs. 4.11, 4.12, 4.22, 4.23, 4.30, 4.31, 4.32 and 4.33 are evaluated using this principle.

4.6 Equation of Motion
Following the extended Hamilton's principle from Eq. 3.9, the element governing equation of motion can be written as:

([ M h ] + [Me] + [ Mp ])qe(t) + ([ K b ] + [Kc] +

[Kc] + [Kp ])qe(t) = Fe(t) + F;Ct) + Fp(t)
(4.35)

where the modified loading F;. in the viscoelastic core becomes negative when moved to the right-hand-side of the equation. Once the elemental mass and stiffness matrices and force vectors are determined using the Gaussian quadrature, as was mentioned in the previous section, the global equation of motion can be assembled using the finite element technique [32] and may be written as:

[M]ii(t) + [K]q(t) = F(t) + FCt) + ft(t)

(4.36)

where

[M], [K], F, F and ft

represent the global mass matrix, stiffness matrix,

external force vector, viscoelastic force vector and electrical force vector, respectively.
51

The Newmark time-integration scheme [32, 34] is used to solve the assembled global equation of motion, Eq. 4.36, after applying the boundary conditions. Some modifications are carried out in this classical algorithm to incorporate the viscoelastic property of the core in fractional calculus. The anelastic displacement history is stored as a new parameter in a matrix. The Newmark parameters jJ = ~ and

r =,7j' are used in

order to obtain an unconditionally stable and second-order accurate scheme [19] (See Appendix A for flow charts of the algorithm utilized in solving the above equation.) The three-layer model has been simulated using Matlab software (Refer to Appendix C for Matlab codes.) In addition, the explanation on how the matrix B is implemented into the code for all three layers is given in Appendix B.

Chapter 5 Numerical Simulation
A number of simulation tests must be performed in order to verify the resulting global equation assembled in the previous section. First, the current formulation is modified so as to be compared to a problem in the literature, such as a sandwich beam with a viscoelastic core [19] or a cantilever beam with a piezoelectric top layer [8]. Second, the results of the effects of different parameter changes are analyzed and verified for consistency. Note that, in the parametric study, only the current formulation is used: FGM beam with the viscoelastic core and the PFRC laminate top-constraining layer.

5.1.1 Viscoelastic-Aluminum Sandwich Beam
As was mentioned earlier, an example from the literature [19] is used in this section to demonstrate the effectiveness of the current Quasi-2D formulation modified to include only an isotropic sandwich beam with a viscoelastic core. In the example, a cantilevered sandwich beam with viscoelastic core and symmetrical aluminum faces is as shown in
Fig. 5.1(a). It is discretized along its length with five finite elements and a transverse load

is applied to the free end in the form of a triangular impulse as shown in the Fig. 5.1(b).

The transverse displacement history of the beam's tip is depicted in Fig. 5.2 for the cantilevered fully-clamped case. The dynamic response of the Quasi-2D formulation with constant transverse displacement w in the host (bottom) layer falls between the conventional method [19] and the Quasi-2D with varying w responses. The phase shift between each method is explained by the degree of accuracy each formulation adheres to. The accuracy level can be determined by the number of degrees of freedom chosen for each element in the following order: 8 DOF for the conventional method, 36 DOF for the Quasi-2D with constant w, and 52 DOF for the Quasi-2D with varying w. The greater the number of DOF means the higher the accuracy of the model. The above mentioned phase shift can be decreased by reducing the aspect ratio (height/length) of the host beam and, hence, eliminating the need for quadratic through-the-thickness interpolation of the displacement, as is in the case of the Quasi-2D with constant w.

Figure 5.2: Dynamic response of viscoelastic sandwich beam fuUy-clamped

Fig. 5.3 describes the comparison between the fully-clamped and partially-clamped

boundary conditions of the Quasi-2D method with a varying transverse displacement in the host beam. In the fully-clamped case, one end of the beam is fully supported, while in the partially-clamped example, both elastic faces are supported and the viscoelastic core is free at both end . Both examples depict the same transverse displacement magnitude and phase, which confirms that the beam is not flexible enough to show any dependency on the type of boundary condition where there is a lack of constraint on one end of the viscoelastic core. The reason for
t~e

response to overlap could be due to the small

thickness of the viscoelastic core relative to the top and bottom sandwich layers.

The results of the controlled tip deflection and the actuation voltage are obtained for both Quasi-2D formulations with constant and varying w in the host beam and are plotted in Fig. 5.5. The formulation with constant w is from the work by Bekuit [8]. As seen from the graph, the dynamic responses for both cases are essentially the same, which 57

1

establishes the consistency of the current formulation with the published results. To further enhance the phase shift between the two examples, as was observed in the case of viscoelastic-aluminum sandwich beam in Fig. 5.1, the gain is set to be Kv
=

O. Zero gain

indicates passive damping of the beam, which results solely from the viscoelastic core. Hence, the difference between the two responses is readily observed in Fig. 5.6(a) as the system takes longer time to dampen. Also, in Fig. 5.6(b), the phase shift is even more distinguished due to the greater thickness of the host beam hb , in which case it is recommended for transverse displacement to be interpolated quadratically to ensure higher accuracy.

5.2 Parametric Study
In this section, the current Quasi-2D formulation is used in a parametric study. The parameters of interest are ply angle

e in the PFRC laminate and Young's modulus

E in

the host beam. As mentioned previously, the elastic layer or the host beam is made of FGM and is treated with the viscoelastic layer, which, in tum, is covered by the PFRC laminate, as seen in Fig. 5.7(a) below. The beam is meshed with five finite elements along the span. The triangular impulse load is given in Fig. 5.7(b).

hp

= 1 mm (thickness of the PFRC layer) and he = 0.25 mm(core thickness). The

mechanical and piezoelectric properties of the host beam and top-constraining layer, respectively, are given in the Table 5.3 below, and the viscoelastic parameters ofISD112 are listed in Table 5.1 in the previous section. The piezoelectric fibers and the matrix of the PFRC laminate are made ofPZT5H and epoxy, respectively. The effective coefficients of PFRC employed in this thesis were predicted using the micromechanical analysis performed by Mallik and Ray in [25], while considering the 40% fiber volume fraction.

Note from the above table that Young's modulus is chosen as an average value, which is achieved by integrating the varying elastic modulus through the thickness of the host beam. The average E in this case is the elastic modulus of the aluminum material. However, the elastic modulus is varied across the thickness of the beam by manipulating the functional gradient A, . The greater the gradient indicates the higher the increase or decrease of stiffness from the bottom to the top surface of the host layer. With regard to the support mechanism, three types of supports are studied in each subsection, including the cantilevered, fixed-end and simply-supported beams. For each case, the effects of ply orientation in the PFRC laminate and functional gradient A, in the host layer are examined. A simple velocity feedback is adopted for the controlled vibration. See the algorithm flow chart in Appendix A for further explanation.

5.2.1 Effect of Ply Orientation
In order to examine the effect of ply orientation on the dynamic response of the beam, parameters, like the Young's modulus in the host layer and the number of plies in the top layer are fixed or unchanged. A six-ply quasi-isotropic PFRC laminate with the stacking sequence [0° I e1- e1- eI e I 0°] , where angle

e is the fiber angle relative to the

+ x axis of each layer, is used. The sequence may be abbreviated to its short form
notation of [0° I± e]s' where subscript S denotes symmetry. The shorthand notation is to be used in the subsequent investigations of different ply angles. As mentioned earlier, the functional gradient A,
=

0 in the FOM beam, which

indicates that the elastic modulus is constant throughout the host beam and its material is homogeneous isotropic.

5.2.1.1 Cantilevered Beam Case

Figure 5.8: Schematic of a cantilevered beam fully-clamped and entirely covered with ACLD treatment.

The gain is set to Kv

= 350

V j(mls) , which is chosen only to best represent the

effects, since the use of higher gain is permitted given that the resulting actuation voltage is not in the breakdown voltage range, which is approximately 200 V for most piezoelectric ceramics. The observation time of the beam subjected to an impulse load is taken to be 1 second. According to fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, the time step is chosen to be I'lt = 0.001 s and the resulting number of terms in the Grunwald approximation of the fractional derivative N = 1000. The load is the triangular impulse force applied at the free tip of the beam and given in Fig. 5.7(b). For various ply orientations, Fig. 5.9 shows the plot of uncontrolled transverse displacement of the node on the tip of the beam for the case of only passive damping.
Figs. 5.10 and 5.11 depict the controlled tip deflection and the corresponding actuation

voltage, respectively, for each angle () arrangement. Comparing Figs. 5.9 and 5.10, the effectiveness of the active-passive combination of damping is readily noted over the employment of only a passive element. The responses are independent of the boundary conditions (i.e., fully-clamped or partially-clamped). This could be due to a very small

63

thickness of the viscoelastic layer, which would not be thick enough to increase flexibility of the beam in the case of partially-clamped boundary conditions. The PFRC laminate acts as one layer with longitudinal piezoelectric fibers when the angle B is zero for each ply (See Figs. 5.9(a), 5.10(a) and 5.11(a).) Figs. 5.9(b), 5.9(c) and
5.9(d)

depict the results for the following angle orientation: [0° /± 90°]5' [0° /± 60°]5 and

[0° /± 45°]5 respectively. The same ply orientation order and stacking sequence are followed in Figs. 5.10(b), 5.10(c) and 5.10(d) for actively controlled deflection and in Figs.
5.11 (b), 5.11(c)

and 5.11(d) for actuator voltage response. The response in Fig. 5.10(b) shows

a faster damping of the transverse displacement magnitude with a bit of higher initial response than in Fig. 5.10(a). In the passive case of Fig. 5.9, the better result in terms of damping occurs with a zero angle B in each ply, as the fibers with zero degree orientation fully contribute to the bending resistance, while fibers with B = 90° do not. However, since piezoelectric fibers in Fig. 5.10 act as actuators by manipulating the PFRC laminate, the above observation no longer applies and a better damping result occurs, instead, in Fig. 5.10(b). In this response, fibers with B = 90° increase the flexibility of the beam, which, in tum, enables the constraining layer to be more apt for control. The response in Fig. 5.10(c) is worse than in Fig. 5.10(a) in terms of attenuation, while the result of Fig. 5.10(d) exhibits the least damping and does not reasonably attenuate the vibration with the observation time of 1 second. The reason could be due to the relatively low contribution to the bending stiffness matrix D. The actuator voltage responses in Fig. 5.11 correspond to the deflection responses in Fig. 5.10 because of their linear relationship to response velocity. It can be noted that the magnitudes of the voltages are well below the breakdown value of 200V.

The response is independent of the stacking sequence for any ply angle in a quasiisotropic laminate if active damping is activated. However, Fig. 5.12 indicates that when only passive damping is considered, that is, the piezoelectric fibers in the laminate contribute only to the stiffness matrix, the 0° layers are less efficiently located near the reference surface of the laminate. This is because the stiffness and strength of longitudinal fibers are not fully utilized if they are located near the reference surface when bending is the primary response. It is further observed from Fig. 5.12(a) that the response with [0° /± 90 0 ]s stacking sequence dampens faster than the response with [±90° fools sequence, which supports the earlier assertion. Fig. 5.12(b) shows a phase change in the responses beyond 1 second. Note that the thickness of the host beam has been changed to hb
=

1.75 mm to best illustrate this behavior/observation.

5.2.1.2 Fixed-End Partially-Constrained Beam Case
A fixed-end beam refers to a beam with both ends clamped as shown in Fig. 5.13 below. Also, the fixed-end beam is only partially constrained in order to take advantage of the actuation of the PFRC laminate. As seen from the figure, elements 2,3, and 4 are constrained with both viscoelastic and PFRC laminate layers, while elements 1 and 5 remain unconstrained. The triangular impulse load (see Fig. 5.7(b» is applied to the middle upper node of the element 3 in the transverse direction.

The gain used in this scenario is the same (Kv

=

350 Vj(m/s)) as is in the

cantilevered case. The only changes made to the parameter specifications include the thickness of the host beam, which is reduced to hb
=

2.5 mm, and the time period is set to
=

0.5 seconds instead of 1 second as in the previous example, which results in N

500

terms. Note that modifications are solely made for enhanced presentation and are not necessarily optimal. Though this case is considered as a different problem from the cantilever case, one can observe the decreased deflection and higher frequency of vibration, which are consistent with the form of the boundary conditions. The deflection is observed at the middle node of the composite beam in the direction of the applied load. Figs. 5.14 and 5.15 depict the passive and active damping responses of the transverse displacement at the middle node, respectively. Fig. 5.16 shows the actuator voltage corresponding to the response in Fig. 5.15. Ply angle orientation is

70

illustrated in the same order and form of [0° /± O]s notation as in the previous case. In general, Figs. 5.14, 5.15, and 5.16 follow the same pattern of response as the Figs. 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11 of the cantilevered beam, respectively.
Fig. 5.14(a)

shows the best result in terms of faster damping, which can be

explained by the same reasoning as was done regarding Fig. 5.9. The response with [0° /± 90°]5 from Fig. 5.15(b) also shows a slightly greater damping pattern than in Fig.
5.15(a) 5.15(d)

due to the enhancement of actuation control in a more flexible PFRC laminate. Fig. shows the worst damping response, since only a horizontal component of the

fibers contributes to the bending stiffnesses, while, at the same time, the flexibility of the PFRC laminate is not increased in the bending direction as in the case of Fig. 5.15(b). Fig.
5.16

shows the control voltage response in direct proportionality with the derivative of the

response of Fig. 5.15.

Figure 5.17: Schematic of a simply-supported beam.

The gain Kv

=

350 Vj(m/s) as in the previous cases and the host beam thickness

is also reduced to hb = 2.5 mm as in the fixed-end beam case. The observation time period is 0.5 seconds, as in the previous example, and the number of Grunwald approximation terms N = 500. The triangular impulse load (see Fig. 5.7(b)) is applied to the middle node in the transverse direction in the same manner as in the fixed-end beam case.
Figs. 5.18, 5.19, and 5.20 depict the passive damping, active damping, and actuator

voltage responses, respectively, of the simply-supported beam. Based on these figures, it is noted that the deflection is higher in the simply-supported beam than in the fixed-end partially-constrained beam case. This result is compatible with the form of support at both ends, which is characterized by the number of displacement points clamped. For this particular case, the lesser number indicates the greater flexibility of the beam and, thus, higher deflection.

75

Different ply angle arrangements follow the same order as in the previous cases.
Fig. 5.18(a) shows the fastest damping and Fig. 5.18(c) and 5.18(d) describe very slow

attenuation rate due to the same reasons given in the previous subsections. However, in
Fig 5.19, the best damping response is observed in Fig. 5.19(a) rather than 5.19(b), as was the

case in the previous examples. Here, the beam is already flexible enough to enable a successful actuation of the PFRC laminate with the addition oflongitudinal plies amplifying the bending resistance as well. In Fig. 5.19(b), it is interesting to note a slight fluctuation of the deflection response even after the most damping is achieved at around 0.2 s. This could be accounted for with the higher frequencies dominating the response. Since the beam is already flexible enough with only two point supports, the ply orientation [0° I± 90 0 ]s does not contribute to attenuation of the higher frequency vibration response.

5.2.2 Effect of FGM Properties
The effect of functional grade in a host beam is studied by fixing each ply orientation at () = 0° in the PFRC laminate. The host beam stiffness either increases or decreases with height by varying Young's modulus E across its thickness. In the case of stiffness decreasing (increasing) with height, the higher stiffness is at the bottom (top) of the host beam. In order to have a varying elastic modulus, one must manipulate the functional gradient A, which is a function of the top and bottom surface Young's moduli,
E~ and E~ , respectively, and thickness of the FGM beam hb as seen in Section 3.2.2.
Table 5.4

shows how the elastic moduli vary for a given A. Note that a constant average
=

E, the elastic modulus of aluminum (Eavg to permit reasonable comparison.

70.3 GPa ), is used for each A. This is done

5.2.2.1 Cantilevered Beam Case
The cantilever beam problem remains the same with the parameter specifications mentioned in Section 5.2.1 and illustrated in Fig. 5.8. The dynamic response is observed for both fully- and partially-clamped boundary conditions. As seen from Figs. 5.21, 5.22 and 5.23, the response for the two conditions coincide, as was the case in the previous section.
Figs. 5.21

and 5.22 correspond to the response of the system in the passive and

active states, respectively. Fig. 5.23 represents the actuation voltage response when the gain of Kv = 350 Vj(mls) is applied to the composite beam. In Figs. 5.21(a), 5.21(b), and
5.21(c)

the passive damping response is shown for the following functional gradients:

A = 500, A = 0, and A = -500, respectively. The corresponding elastic moduli for the

80

bottom and top surfaces of the host layer are as tabulated in Table 5.4. Comparing Figs.
5.21(a)

and 5.21(b), one observes a better damping response when the beam is

homogeneously isotropic than in the case of gradual increase of stiffness with height in the host beam. A functional gradient of 500, as in Fig. 5.21(a), yields lower elastic modulus at the bottom of the beam and higher Young's modulus at the interface between the host and viscoelastic layers. Fig. 5.21(c), however, shows a better result with greater damping than Fig. 5.21(b), where the host beam stiffness is gradually decreasing from the bottom to the top. The lack of effectiveness of the greater stiffness at the top surface of the host layer results because the top surface is located near the reference surface of the total beam, that is, near what would have been the "neutral axis" if the beam was completely isotropic. In other words, the greater stiffness and strength of the FG material is not utilized completely if it is located near the reference surface and if the primary response is the bending response. Another reason for this trend comes from the increased passive damping in the vibration of the system, as seen in Fig. 5.21(c). The top surface of the host beam, being lower in stiffness than the bottom surface and bonded to the viscoelastic core, increases the shear deformation of the viscoelastic core and, in tum, increases the passive damping of the beam.
Fig. 5.22

emphasizes the effectiveness of active-passive damping over the sole use

of passive damping in Fig. 5.21. Similar to the passive case, Fig. 5.22(c) also shows a faster damping with a lower initial response than in Fig. 5.22(a). In spite of the reasons mentioned above regarding passive damping, the application of negative functional gradient to the host beam affects active damping as well. This is because the PFRC laminate/viscoelastic combination layer is now attached to a more flexible surface of the beam, which can enhance the control by the actuator. The actuator voltage responses in
Fig 5.23

are proportional to the rate of the deflection responses in Fig. 5.22.

5.2.2.2 Fixed-End Partially-Constrained Beam Case
A fixed-end beam partially covered with viscoelastic and PFRC laminate constraining layers is shown in Fig. 5.13 in Section 5.2.1. The parameters remain the same. The same response pattern is repeated as in the previous case, featuring the response due to only passive damping in Fig. 5.24, the response with active damping in Fig. 5.25, and the control voltage response in Fig. 5.26. When comparing Figs. 5.24 and 5.25, note that incorporation of actuation in the composite beam does not have as significant an effect on the damping of the system as it does in Figs. 5.21 and 5.22 of the cantilever beam case. Similar to the previous example, the responses in Figs. 5.24(c) and 5.25(c) highlight a faster damping trend than in Figs. 5.24(a) and 5.25(a), respectively. The reasoning for this occurrence is the same as that of the cantilever case. However, in this scenario, the figures with A = -500 show a slightly higher initial response magnitude than with A = 0 in Figs. 5.24 and 5.25. This observation reflects the type of support, which, in this case, constrains two ends of the beam. In Figs. 5.24(c) and 5.25(c), the beam becomes more flexible as it has more concentrated stiffness in the bottom part and less in the upper part of the host layer. In Figs. 5.24(b) and 5.25(b), however, the beam is homogeneously isotropic and hence flexibility of the beam is not increased. This flexibility issue explains the slightly higher initial response in Figs. 5.24(c) and 5.25(c). The same pattern can also be seen when comparing Figs. 5.26(b) and 5.26(c).

5.2.2.3 Simply-Supported Beam Case
The same simply-supported beam shown in Fig. 5.17 and explained in Section 5.2.1 is used in this section. Figs. 5.27 and 5.28 depict the effects of functional gradient IL on the middle node deflection when the beam is damped passively and actively, respectively. Fig. 5.29 shows the actuator voltage response when the system's gain
Kv
=

350 Vj(m/s) , as in the previous sections. Figs. 5.27(c) and 5.28(c) also show the best

results in terms of damping rate. However, as observed in the case of fixed-end beam,
Figs. 5.27(c) and 5.28(c) (for IL = -500) show slightly higher initial response than Figs. 5.27(b) and 5.28(b) (IL

= 0). The reason for this is explained in the previous case, and it is

compatible with the above explanation on the importance of the support mechanism. In this case, unlike in the cantilevered beam, two opposite comers are constrained thus limiting much movement in the transverse direction. Making the host beam stiffer at the bottom rather than at the top surfaces, most likely, enhances the initial flexibility of the system; however, it reduces the flexibility once the stiffnesses located farther from the reference axis start contributing to the vibration suppression. Since the flexibility of the system is greatly limited considering its support mechanism, this type of beam does not yield to actuation as well as the cantilevered beam does. Fig. 5.29(c) shows the least voltage required to suppress the vibration of the beam, as observed in the other cases.

Chapter 6 Summary and Recommendations
The preceding chapters presented a quasi-two-dimensional finite element formulation for vibration analysis of a functionally graded (FG) beam with active-passive constrained layer damping (ACLD) treatment. The viscoelastic layer, as part of ACLD treatment, contributes to passive damping of the structure, while the piezoelectric fiberreinforced composite (PFRC) laminate acts as an active constraining layer. The piezoelectric fibers in the PFRC act as the actuator of the system by means of a velocity feedback control system. The PFRC laminate comprises six plies, each of which is orientated at a ply angle () in the reference plane of the system. Classical laminate theory is used to determine the ABD constitutive matrix relating force and moment resultants with strains and curvatures. The Young's modulus of the FG beam is assumed to vary exponentially along the thickness of the host beam, while the Poisson's ratio is constant over the domain of the beam. A four-parameter fractional derivative model is used in describing the time-dependent behavior of the viscoelastic material. The three-layer beam model is built assuming the Timoshenko hypothesis for all layers. The deformation of the top constraining layer follows the same assumption of a basic three-layer theory, where the axial displacement is linear through the thickness and the transverse displacement is constant. In the host beam and the core, however, the axial displacement varies cubically, while the transverse displacement varies quadratically through the thickness. The field variables are interpolated through the thickness of the composite beam using the polynomial expansion, while cubic Lagrange finite elements are used to interpolate along the span. This formulation results in a smaller number of degrees of freedom than in other more conventional two-dimensional models, which use many elements through the thickness to avoid an aspect ratio problem. However, this model still produces highly accurate results. The formulation is suitable only for small deformations. The formulation was compared with two examples from the literature: a viscoelasticaluminum sandwich beam and a cantilever beam with viscoelastic and piezoelectric constraining layers. The parametric study showed superior performance of the activepassive combination constraining layer over the sole use of passive damping. Three

different cases were simulated; namely, the cantilevered, fixed-end partially-constrained and simply-supported beams. When analyzing the effect of ply orientation, it was noted that the active cantilevered beam, with [0° /± 90 0 ]s stacking sequence (i.e., cross-ply), showed the fastest attenuation rate. However, for passive damping, the best result in terms of damping rate was observed when the ply angles are all equal to zero. For the fixed-end beam, a similar vibration pattern was followed, though with smaller amplitude and higher frequency. In the simply-supported scenario, however, both the actively controlled and the uncontrolled deflection results showed higher damping rate in the instance of all longitudinal plies. During the study of the effects of FGM properties on the vibration suppression, the response with negative functional gradient (i.e., stiffness decreases with height) yielded the best damping result. This is true in each support case and during both the active and passive treatments. Though the current study encompasses several issues, from the development of quasi-two-dimensional model to the utilization of various materials to enhance the structure, there are numerous opportunities for further development. The extension of this work might contribute to the solution of a problem of noise and vibration reduction, which is increasing rapidly with the introduction of new components and machines in today's industrial world. The future steps to take include the following:

a. Since optimization usually follows the design and development part of the component process, it must be considered in the future work. In the current formulation and analysis the geometrical parameters were chosen only for the purpose of presenting the results with a higher quality of observation. Also, the control gain chosen for each simulation was again based on the need to increase readability of the results and did not represent the optimum solution. As mentioned previously, the gain is selectable as long as it does not destabilize the system and yields control voltage in the safe range of the piezoelectric material. Determination of control gains can be achieved by using the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control theory [3].

94

b. With regard to the previous point, optimum location of the active constraining layer must also be considered as it may enhance the actuation capability of the structure. For instance, the PFRC laminate would fully contribute to the damping of the system if it is located close to the clamped part of the beam, since, at that point, the flexural moment is the greatest and hence must be counterbalanced with the moment created by the electrical force induced in the PFRC laminate.

c. The current formulation can be extended to accommodate dynamic analysis of plates and/or shells. Using a quasi-three-dimensional finite element model as in [9], the FG plate with bonded viscoelastic layer and PFRC laminate can be formulated and analyzed. Bicubic trial functions would have to be incorporated to model both in-plane (x,y) displacement characteristics. Compared to threedimensional finite element analysis, in the quasi-three-dimensional model, numerical errors associated with element aspect ratio would be avoided [9].

d. The use of different viscoelastic models can be researched. The four-parameter fractional derivative model utilized in this thesis is not readily available in the commercial finite element analysis software, such as ANSYS. The Prony series method or plotting master curves can be incorporated into the viscoelastic layer modeling in the future.

e. Considering the effectiveness of varying elastic modulus such that the activepassive constraining layer comes in contact with the "softer" side of the host beam, the viscoelastic core can also be extended to being functionally graded. This could prove effective as the active constraining layer would be bonded to the surface of the viscoelastic layer with minimum stiffness and, hence, increase actuation of the beam.

f.

Furthermore, the current formulation can be verified by experimental study. Vibration simulation tests can be performed and the deflection of the beam may be measured via a sensor and compared to the numerical simulation results.

Since the matrix

is not a function of x, the derivative components of operator

[Db] [Db]

do not affect the matrix

[Tb] . Hence, combining Eqs. [8 - 2] and [8 - 3] for an
[Bb]
ofEq. 4.12 with implemented operator

element yields the newly formulated matrix components:

[8 - 4]

The matrix

[Be]

for the core is formulated in the same manner as for the host beam,

given that the axial and transverse displacements are also expressed through the thickness by cubic and quadratic functions, respectively.

For the top layer: The local displacement vector

{Up}

is rearranged in such a way as to obtain modified

derivative operator matrices [ D~ ] and be written as:

[D;, ] . Consequently, the displacement vector can
