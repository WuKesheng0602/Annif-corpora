i. Abstract
This  Major  Research  Paper  (MRP)  closely  examines  IKEA  North  York  as  an   organization  that  constructs  visual  messages  in  their  retail  environments  and  persuasively   communicates  to  its  shoppers  through  visuals  in  product  displays,  including  display   structure,  signage,  and  location,  to  encourage  consumer  behaviour  and  impact  purchasing   decisions.  Three  product  displays  were  closely  examined  in  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"   department  of  IKEA  North  York's  Market  Hall  through  a  thorough  visual  analysis  of  each   product  display  utilizing  four  guiding  concepts  derived  from  document  design  and  visual   communication  (information  hierarchy,  white  space,  colour,  and  ambience)  and  examining   corresponding  consumer  behaviour  through  on-site  observations.  Preliminary  conclusions   state  that  while  IKEA  North  York  effectively  designs  its  retail  space  on  a  2-dimensional   plane,  further  consideration  needs  to  be  taken  when  designing  the  3-dimensional  nature  of   the  store  environment.  This  research  could  be  furthered  through  the  inclusion  of  a  broader   data  set  and  wider  criteria  for  examination.

1. Introduction
Paco  Underhill  (1999),  founder  of  the  field  of  retail  geography  and  author  of  Why   We  Buy:  The  Science  of  Shopping,  states,  "many  purchasing  decisions  are  made,  or  can  be   heavily  influenced,  on  the  floor  of  [a]  store  itself.  Shoppers  are  susceptible  to  impressions   and  information  they  acquire  in  stores...  As  a  result,  an  important  medium  for  transmitting   messages  and  closing  sales  is  now  the  store  and  the  aisle"  (p.  32).  A  store  is  not  merely  a   physical  space  in  which  products  are  sold;  it  is  also  a  medium  to  subtly  communicate   persuasive  messages  to  consumers.   My  Major  Research  Paper  (MRP)  closely  examines  IKEA  North  York  as  an   organization  that  constructs  visual  messages  in  their  retail  environments.  These  messages   seek  to  attract  shoppers'  attention,  create  consumer-driven  desires,  and  motivate  the   viewing  public  to  respond  to  aesthetically  rich  communication  through  consumption.  My   research  investigates  how  IKEA  North  York  persuasively  communicates  to  its  shoppers   through  visuals  in  product  displays,  including  display  structure,  signage,  and  location,  to   encourage  consumer  behaviour  and  impact  purchasing  decisions.   The  theoretical  orientation  for  my  MRP  examines  document  design  in  the  field  of   visual  communication,  as  well  as  professional  research  pertaining  to  retail  design  and   visual  merchandising.  The  site  of  my  research  is  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"  department   of  IKEA  North  York's  Market  Hall.  In  order  to  collect  my  visual  documents  and  monitor   consumer's  shopping  behaviour  on  site  I  observed  consumer  behaviour  through  a  micro- ethnographical  approach,  photo  documented  product  displays,  and  mapped  IKEA  North   York's  retail  space  from  my  research  site.  Following  my  data  collection,  I  applied  a   predetermined  set  of  guiding  concepts,  derived  from  document  design  and  visual  

  

6  

communication,  to  each  product  display  through  visual  analysis  in  order  to  deconstruct  the   communication  latent  behind  the  display's  aesthetic  design  elements.  My  overall  goal  for   my  MRP  is  to  contribute  to  the  definition  of  "communication"  to  include  forms  of  mediation   that  are  more  implicit  and  inherent  in  everyday  spaces  and  environments,  namely  visual   design  and  its  function  to  drive  consumer  behaviour.  

2. Importance of Research  
Although  literature  and  current  research  exists  in  the  fields  of  retail  design  and   visual  merchandising,  and  the  subsequent  effect  of  these  environmental  cues  on  consumer   behaviour  and  shopper  patronage  intentions,  there  is  no  evidence  of  an  in-depth  analysis  of   IKEA's  visual  retail  design.  However,  IKEA  has  been  discussed  in  current  academic   literature  in  regards  to  their  overall  brand.  Edvardsson,  Enquist,  and  Hay  (2006)  use  IKEA   as  a  case  study  to  create  a  framework  that  focuses  on  how  corporate  values  are   communicated  to  customers.  Furthermore,  Roncha  (2008)  asserts  that  Nordic  brands,  such   as  IKEA,  differentiate  themselves  from  competitors  in  a  global  market  by  promoting  their   heritage  through  various  forms  of  communication.  Finally,  Elliott,  Eccles,  and  Ritson  (1996)   discuss  DIKEA,  a  lesbian  group  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  describe  how  symbolic   meanings  derived  from  shopping  at  IKEA  are  used  to  create  group  identity.     Regardless  of  the  brand's  recognition  in  past  research,  IKEA  represents  a  successful   cross-cultural  organization  whose  entire  global  brand  is  famous  for  designing  their  retail   environments  to  keep  shoppers  consuming.  As  such,  my  MRP  fills  a  void  in  an  increasingly   important  field  of  study.  Through  my  MRP  I  hope  to  demonstrate  the  effects  of  visual  forms   of  communication  in  retail  environments,  which  is  an  important  field  in  both  academic  and   applied  contexts.  In  regards  to  professional  communication,  my  MRP  looks  at  the  

  

7  

interdisciplinary  themes  regarding  the  rhetoric  of  space.  In  a  professional  context,  my  MRP   can  aid  retailers  who,  in  our  consumer-driven  market,  aim  to  persuade  more  shoppers  to   conspicuously  consume,  and  shoppers  themselves,  who  have  found  themselves  bombarded   with  corporate  messaging  and  are  on  the  other  end  of  the  aisle  interested  in  bypassing   retailer  strategies.  

3. Research Questions
My  MRP  will  attempt  to  answer  the  following  questions:     o How  does  IKEA  North  York  use  elements  of  visual  communication  to  persuade  its   shoppers  to  make  purchases  through  the  visual  components  of  their  product   displays?   o To  what  degree  are  the  visual  product  displays  in  the  "Cookshop  and  Tableware"   department  at  IKEA  North  York  effective  in  garnering  sales  from  shoppers?   o What  visual  communication  changes,  if  any,  can  be  made  to  make  IKEA's  Market   Hall  retail  space  more  conducive  to  consumer's  behaviours  and  shopping  habits?  

4. Theoretical Orientation
The  theoretical  orientation  for  my  MRP  examines  the  fields  of  document  design,   visual  communication,  and  visual  rhetoric,  in  addition  to  highlighting  an  applied  approach   to  the  study  of  retail  design  and  visual  merchandising.  More  specifically,  document  design   and  visual  merchandising  will  be  the  basis  of  the  theoretical  framework  for  my  MRP  and,  as   such,  provide  the  guiding  concepts  for  my  research.  However,  while  I  will  argue  that   elements  of  visual  communication  in  the  retail  environment  have  persuasive  qualities,  the   area  of  visual  rhetoric  will  act  as  a  theoretical  supplement  to  my  research.  That  is,  the  area   of  visual  rhetoric  will  be  addressed  to  cover  the  theoretical  landscape  associated  with      8  

persuasive  messaging.  The  integration  of  the  practical  field  of  retail  design  in  my  MRP  will   provide  supplementary  theories  and  proven-results  to  complement  my  research.  As  my   MRP  has  both  theoretical  and  practical  implications,  I  think  it  is  important  to  begin  my   research  from  both  an  academic  communications  perspective  as  well  as  from  a  corporate   and  marketing  point-of-view.   a. Document Design One  area  of  scholarly  research  that  will  serve  as  a  starting  point  for  my  MRP  is   document  design,  which  stems  from  the  larger  field  of  visual  communication  and  design.   Professional  communication  scholars  have  worked  extensively  in  this  field  and  many  of  the   concepts  discussed  will  serve  as  the  theoretical  foundation  for  my  work.  Schriver  (1997)   defines  document  design  as  the  "field  concerned  with  creating  texts  (broadly  defined)  that   integrate  words  and  pictures  in  ways  that  help  people  to  achieve  their  specific  goals"  (p.   10).  Schriver  (1997)  elaborates  that  document  design  is  the  "act  of  bringing  together  prose,   graphics,  and  typography  for  purposes  of  instruction,  information,  or  persuasion"  (p.  10- 11).     Primarily,  document  design  discusses  space  as  it  relates  to  a  two-dimensional  plane,   such  as  a  page  or  screen.  However,  according  to  Schriver  (1997)  using  the  word  `document'   may  create  some  confusion  because  document  design  can  also  be  used  to  interpret  three- dimensional  fields,  including  retail  environments,  redefining  what  a  document  is  in   academic  practice.  Schriver  (1997)  states  that  documents  are  "no  longer  constrained  to   static  and  linear  formats"  (p.  4)  explaining  that  the  term  `document'  is  merely  a   "placeholder  to  a  text-like  artifact  composed  in  print  or  mixed  media"  (p.5).  From  a  page   layout  to  a  store  layout,  concepts  derived  from  document  design  can  be  easily  applied  to  

  

9  

any  sort  of  design  or  visual  artifact.  Therefore,  document  design  will  be  a  highly  relevant   part  of  the  foundation  to  my  study  of  retail  space  especially  from  a  professional   communication  perspective.         b. Visual Rhetoric Simply  put,  visual  rhetoric  is  the  "relationship  of  visual  images  to  persuasion"   (Helmers  and  Hill,  2004,  p.  1).  More  specifically,  visual  rhetoric  discusses  how  various   visual  images  communicate  to  create  meaning  or  construct  an  aesthetic  argument.  The   framing  idea  of  visual  rhetoric  is  that  visual  design  can  be  interpreted  in  the  same  way  as   the  interpretation  of  texts  in  more  traditional  rhetorical  forms  where  "visual  elements  are   [likewise]  used  to  influence  people's  attitudes,  opinions,  and  beliefs"  (Helmers  and  Hill,   2004,  p.  2).  Kenneth  Burke  (1950)  believed  that  "wherever  there  is  persuasion,  there  is   rhetoric.  And  wherever  there  is  `meaning'  there  is  persuasion"  (p.  172).  Burke  is  suggesting   that  rhetoric  exists  not  only  in  language  and  words,  but  can  also  be  encapsulated  in  visual   elements.  Just  as  words  can  take  on  rhetorical  qualities  of  persuasion,  elements  of  design   can  also  adopt  basic  rhetorical  strategies.  Similar  to  the  rhetorical  tradition,  visual  rhetoric   has  an  inherent  persuasive  quality  as  specific  messages  can  be  created  in  a  visual  form  to   send  to  audiences  (Kostenick  and  Roberts,  1998).     Based  on  this  definition  of  visual  rhetoric,  I  posit  that  the  rhetoric  of  space  can  be   described  as  how  a  physical  space,  which  can  also  be  viewed  as  a  three-dimensional  visual   document  in  space,  can  persuade  people  to  achieve  specific  goals  such  as  driving   purchasing  behaviour.  Dickenson  and  Maugh  (2004)  discuss  visual  rhetoric  in  the  built   environment  in  regards  to  the  persuasive  qualities  in  Wild  Oats  Market  grocery  stores,  they   state  that  the  "grocery  store  ­  banal  as  it  may  be  ­  is  a  crucial  place  for  understanding  

  

10  

everyday,  visual  rhetoric  in  a  postmodern  world"  (p.  259).  Additionally,  the  authors  posit   that  "visual  rhetoric  in  space  becomes  most  compelling  not  simply  when  the  vision  is   compelling,  but  when  the  rhetoric  appeals  to  the  intersections  among  the  five  senses"   (Dickenson  and  Maugh,  2004,  p.  272).  Visual  forms  of  communication,  including  retail   design  and  the  store  environment,  ultimately  lead  to  some  kind  of  rhetorical   transformation  such  as  persuading  people  to  shop  and  consume.   c. Retail Design and Visual Merchandising Retail  design  is  a  specialized  field,  which  can  be  seen  as  a  subsidiary  of  retail   marketing,  that  seeks  to  create  effective  branded  environments  (Kerfoot,  Davies,  and  Ward,   2003).  The  primary  purpose  of  any  retail  space  is  to  sell  product  to  consumers  and,   therefore,  retail  environments  must  be  designed  in  a  way  that  promotes  a  pleasant   shopping  experience  for  the  customer,  as  well  as  a  profitable  return  for  retailers  (Colborne,   1996).  Visual  merchandising  builds  upon  the  retail  design  of  a  store,  as  it  is  the  practice  of   crafting  displays  and  creating  floor  plans  in  retail  environments  for  the  purpose  of  drawing   shopper  attention  and  maximizing  sales  (Pegler,  2006).  Visual  merchandisers  use  a  variety   of  strategies  in  creating  effective  retail  displays  including  color,  lighting,  signage,  and   product  information  (Kerfoot,  Davies,  and  Ward,  2003).  Many  retailers  have  found  ways  of   structuring  man-made  environments  to  make  them  more  conducive  for  retail  purposes  and   a  more  effective  means  of  persuading  shoppers  to  consume.  While  both  retail  design  and   visual  merchandising  can  be  seen  as  more  applied,  rather  than  theoretical,  fields,   substantial  research  has  been  done  to  trace  the  effects  of  the  design  of  retail  environments   on  consumer  behaviour  and  patronage  intention;  for  instance,  researchers  have  explore   various  elements  of  store  atmosphere,  including  colour  and  lighting  (Bellizzi,  Crowley,  and  

  

11  

Hasty,  1983;  Babin,  Hardesty,  and  Suter,  2003),  social  factors  (Baker,  Levy,  and  Grewal,   1992),  ambient  factors  like  music  and  lighting  (Kellaris  and  Kent,  1992;  Milliman,  1982;   Baker,  Levy,  and  Grewal,  1992),  crowding  (Eroglu  and  Harrell,  1986),  and  point-of- purchase  displays2  (Phillips  and  Bradshaw,  1990),  and  the  ensuing  effects  on  shoppers.

Due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  my  MRP,  my  literature  review  is  focused  on   the  more  applied  fields  of  retail  design,  visual  merchandising,  and  consumer  behaviour,  as   they  provide  a  solid  practical  and  conceptual  foundation  from  which  I  can  further  my   research.  I  explore  two  major  themes  within  the  field  of  retail  design,  which  provide  a   general  overview  of  this  highly-researched  and  frequently  published  discipline.  First,  I   summarize  how  Bloch  (1995),  Kent  (2003,  2007)  and  Kerfoot,  Davies,  and  Ward  (2003)  all   discuss  how  the  design  of  a  retail  space  and  store  environment  can  be  used  to  communicate   to  consumers  through  creative  means.  Then,  I  provide  a  detailed  overview  of  research   based  on  store  atmosphere  and  its  affects  on  consumer  behaviour,  with  a  particular   emphasis  on  atmospherics,  environmental  psychology,  and  visual  cues.   a. Using Design to Communicate to Consumers Bloch  (1995)  states  that  "good  design  attracts  consumers  to  a  product,   communicates  to  them,  and  adds  value  to  the  product  by  increasing  the  quality  of  the  usage   experiences  associated  with  it"  (p.  16).  Bloch  posits  that  the  design  of  a  product  may   contribute  to  its  success  in  various  ways.  This  includes  gaining  consumer  notice  and   attention  in  a  cluttered  marketplace  through  a  product  design's  creation  of  an  effective                                                                                                                    2  Point-of-purchase,  or  point-of-sale,  displays  are  where  a  transaction  occurs.  This  often   refers  to  the  checkout  counter  in  retail  environments.        12  

initial  impression  because,  as  Bloch  (1995)  emphasizes,  "the  exterior  appearance  of  a   product  is  important  as  a  means  of  communicating  information  to  consumers"  (p.  18).   Likewise,  Kent  (2007)  posits  that  while  creativity  and  ingenuity  are  often  used  in  the   design  of  products  sold  by  retailers,  they  are  often  not  utilized  in  the  design  of  the  retail   environment  itself.  Kent  claims  that  creativity  in  retail  environments  is  manifested  in  store   design.  Kent  (2007)  emphasizes  the  importance  of  creatively  designing  a  retail  space  for   the  purpose  of  creating  individual  consumer  experiences.  Rather  than  focus  solely  on  the   products  being  sold,  Kent  (2007)  suggests  that  retailers  must  be  "creative  to  find  or  invent   new  environments  in  which  space,  cost  and  flexibility  are  matched  to  the  effective   communication  of  the  retailer's  brand  values  and  the  stimulation  of  consumer  purchasing   activity"  (p.  736).  Above  all  else,  Kent  (2007)  posits  that  retail  design  has  to  be  "multi- faceted  by  linking  together  art,  instinct  and  business  in  a  problem  solving  and  planning   process"  (p.  736).   Furthermore,  Kent  (2003)  discusses  how  retail  branding  must  be  approached  from   a  multi-dimensional  perspective.  Retailer  brands  are  more  than  just  the  two-dimensional   visual  expression  of  advertisements,  as  the  field  is  expanding  to  embrace  branding  in  the   three-dimensional  spaces  of  the  store  environment.  In  his  discussion  of  the  history  of   branding  in  the  retail  sector,  Kent  (2003)  defines  the  concept  of  "brand  personality",  which   describes  the  expression  of  the  values,  culture,  and  identity  of  an  organization  through  the   use  of  visual  cues.  While  a  store's  image  is  the  "overall  perception  of  a  store  perceived  by   consumers",  the  "personality  of  the  retail  store"  can  lead  to  consumer's  forming  thoughts   and  feelings  about  how  the  store  influences  their  shopping  behaviour  and  loyalty.   Historically,  Kent  (2003)  posits,  in  comparison  to  product  manufacturers,  "retailers  were  

  

13  

slow  to  take  up  both  product  and  corporate  branding"  (p.  133).  Regardless,  there  has   always  been  a  strong  relationship  between  products,  the  retail  environment,  and  store   patronage  despite  retailer's  reluctance  to  acknowledge  the  importance  of  branding  on  a   three-dimensional  plane.     Designing  store  environments,  that  is,  the  use  of  three-dimensional  planes  rather   than  two-dimensional  ones,  can  also  be  described  as  "visual  merchandising".  Kerfoot,   Davies,  and  Ward  (2003)  define  visual  merchandising  as  how  brands,  and  their  requisite   stores  and  products,  are  "visually  communicated  to  the  customer  and  also  whether  this   message  is  decoded  `appropriately'  in  this  context  affecting  a  positive  psychological  or   behavioural  outcome,  ultimately  leading  to  purchase"  (p.  143).  As  such,  these  authors   suggest  that  retailers  have  implemented  numerous  methods  to  display  merchandise  and   communicate  product  and  retail  brand  in  order  to  incite  consumer  interest  in  products.   According  to  Kent  (2003),  the  psychological  impact  of  the  store's  environment  creates  an   image  of  the  retailer  in  the  consumer's  mind.  Kent  (2003)  claims  that,  "environmental  cues   including  signage  and  exterior  design  as  well  as  the  interior  environment  have  been  found   to  be  significant  in  the  predicative  decision  making  by  consumers  of  service  provision"  (p.   134).  Initial  findings,  from  Kerfoot,  Davies,  and  Ward  (2003),  suggest  that  consumers  who   like  a  product  display  will  not  completely  determine  if  they  will  purchase  a  product;  still,   the  design  of  a  display  does  make  it  four  times  more  likely.     b. Store Atmosphere and Consumer Behaviour According  to  Bitner  (1992),  service  environments,  including  commercial  spaces,  can   influence  consumer  decision-making.  Store  environments  are  never  natural  as  they  include   cues,  messages,  and  suggestions  to  consumers  (Markin,  Lillis,  and  Narayana,  1976;  Bitner,      14  

1992).  Retailers  design  store  environments  in  a  manner  that  will  enhance  consumers'   positive  feelings,  which  they  assume  will  lead  to  desirable  consumer  behaviour,  such  as  a   higher  willingness  to  purchase  products  or  longer  stays  in  the  store  environment  (Mano,   1999).  Store  environments  themselves  can  offer  unique  atmospheric  qualities  that  may   influence  a  shopper's  patronage  intention  (Baker,  Grewal  and  Parasuraman,  1994).   Creating  a  unique  and  effective  atmospheric  design  should  be  the  primary  concern  for   retailers  as  it  is  an  important  retail  strategy  for  the  purposes  of  driving  shopping  behaviour   (Turley  and  Chebat,  2002).     The  concept  of  `atmospherics'  was  first  introduced  by  Kotler  (1974)  who  defines   store  atmosphere  as  the  effort  to  intentionally  design  retail  spaces  and  structure   environmental  cues  to  produce  specific  psychological  and  emotional  effects  in  shoppers,   which  will  increase  the  likelihood  of  intended  purchases  and  enhance  the  probability  of   buyer  purchasing.  Kotler  (1974)  states  that  store  atmosphere  can  affect  purchase   behaviour  by  communicating  messages  to  the  store's  intended  audience  because   atmospherics  can  act  as  a  message-creating  medium.   Since  Kotler  (1974)  introduced  the  concept  of  atmospherics,  many  researchers  have   used  this  approach  to  study  the  influence  of  retail  design  on  consumer  behaviour.  Some   researchers  have  focused  their  investigations  on  the  influence  of  specific  atmospheric   elements  and  how  they  affect  consumer  response  and  patronage  intention.  Bellizzi,   Crowley,  and  Hasty  (1983)  address  how  specific  colors  in  retail  applications  can  physically   attract  shoppers  toward  a  retail  display  and  can  also  affect  the  perception  of  store  and   merchandise  image.  Similarly,  Babin,  Hardesty,  and  Suter  (2003)  discuss  how  color  

  

15  

perceptions,  both  alone  and  in  combination  with  store  lighting,  influence  shoppers'   patronage  intentions.  Baker,  Levy,  and  Grewal  (1992)  discuss  how  atmospheric  qualities   such  as  social  factors,  including  the  number  and  relative  friendliness  of  store  employees,   and  ambient  cues,  like  music  and  lighting,  impact  retail  patronage  decision.  Likewise,   Kellaris  and  Kent  (1992)  write  about  how  the  influence  of  music  affects  consumers'   temporal  perceptions  and  Milliman's  (1982)  research  examines  how  background  music   affects  the  behavior  of  supermarket  shoppers.  Phillips  and  Bradshaw  (1990)  claim  that   interactive  influences  are  present  in  most  buying  situations,  but  exert  greater  influence   with  unplanned  purchases  at  point-of-purchase  displays.  Atmospheric  qualities  are  not   limited  to  the  physical  and  environmental  surroundings  in  a  retail  space,  as  they  can  also   include  cues  from  fellow  shoppers,  Eroglu  and  Harrell  (1986),  for  instance,  examine  the   theoretical  and  strategic  aspects  of  how  consumers  are  influenced  by  retail  crowding.     Many  researchers  use  an  environmental  psychology  model  established  by   Mehrabian  and  Russell  (1974)  and  tested  by  Donavan  and  Rossiter  (1982,  1994)  to  study   the  influence  of  store  atmosphere  on  consumer  behaviour  and  provide  explanation  on  how   the  design  of  retail  environments  results  in  psychological  and  subsequent  behavioral   responses  from  consumers.  The  M-R  model  is  based  on  the  Stimulus-Organism-Response   (S-O-R)  paradigm,  which  describes  how  features  of  the  environment  result  in  approach- avoidance  behaviours  of  shoppers  within  the  space  of  the  store.  More  specifically,  positive   psychological  responses  result  in  consumer's  approaching  behavior  in  the  retail   environment  (Bloch,  1995).  Approach  responses  are  part  of  the  aesthetic  experience  and   indicate  consumer  desire  (Bloch,  1995).  For  retailers,  the  most  important  approach   behaviour  is  the  purchase  of  the  product.  In  contrast,  negative  feelings  result  in  avoidance  

  

16  

behavior,  which  can  conclude  with  customers  distancing  themselves  from  a  product  (Bloch,   1995).  Retailers  are  most  concerned  about  avoidance  behaviour  manifesting  in  a   customer's  reluctance  and  refusal  to  make  a  purchase  (Bloch,  1995).  Researchers,  using   methods  derived  from  the  M-R  model,  have  examined  retail  displays  of  women's  intimate   apparel  (Law,  Wong,  and  Yip,  2012),  grocery  stores  (Gilboa  and  Rafael,  2003),  and  CD   stores  (Tai  and  Fung,  1997),  amongst  other  retail  environments.   Although  multisensory  atmospheric  cues  have  been  studied  in  regards  to  their  effect   on  shopping  behaviour,  research  indicates  that  visual  design  aspects  of  the  store   environment,  in  particular,  yield  positive  consumer  responses.  Baker,  Parasuraman,   Grewal,  and  Voss  (2002)  found  that  design  cues  have  a  "stronger  and  more  pervasive   influence"  on  shoppers'  perceptions  than  store  employee  or  music  cues  (p.138).  That  is,   visual  cues  in  the  retail  environment  influence  customers'  perceived  shopping  speed  and   efficiency  in  addition  to  perceived  stress  involved  in  shopping  (Baker  at  al.,  2002).  The   authors  argue  that  retailers  should  give  careful  attention  to  the  design  features  of  stores,   including  store  layout  and  arrangement  of  merchandise,  as  they  have  significant  potential   to  influence  customers'  shopping  experience  and  store  patronage  behaviour  (Baker  et  al.,   2002).  Also,  Babin,  Hardesty,  and  Suter  (2003)  found  that  the  combination  of  colours  and   lighting  plays  a  critical  role  in  influencing  the  purchase  intention  of  consumers  and  store   patronage.  Lastly,  Bellizi,  Crowley,  and  Hasty  (1983)  discuss  how  particular  colours  can   garner  attention  and  result  in  the  approach  behaviour  of  consumers  in  response  to  retail   product  displays.  It  is  clear  that  various  atmospheric  qualities  in  the  store  environment,   including  design  cues  and  visual  communication,  play  a  prominent  role  in  the  behaviour   and  decision-making  process  of  shoppers  and,  as  a  result,  retailers  have  begun  to  take  

  

17  

advantage  of  these  subtle  forms  of  communication  to  persuade  casual  shoppers  to  become   loyal  customers.

6. Methodology
                 The  site  of  my  research  is  IKEA's  North  York  location.  More  specifically,  I  examined  

product  displays  in  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"  department  of  IKEA  North  York's  Market   Hall.  My  methods  for  my  MRP  included  visual  analysis  using  a  predetermined  set  of  guiding   concepts.  I  collected  data  from  my  research  site  through  observing  consumer  behaviour,   photo  documenting  product  displays,  and  mapping  IKEA  North  York's  retail  space.     a. Site Rationale Although  the  focus  of  my  MRP  is  visual  communication  and  retail  design  at  IKEA,  the   site  for  my  research  is  specifically  the  Market  Hall  at  IKEA  North  York,  Canada.  I  chose  to   conduct  my  research  at  IKEA  North  York  because  it  is  one  of  the  busiest  stores  in  the  GTA   with  over  40,000  visitors  weekly.  IKEA  North  York  is  also  well  established  as  an  IKEA   franchise  as  it  is  soon  to  be  the  oldest  IKEA  location  in  North  America.  Lastly,  compared  to   the  other  GTA  locations  of  IKEA,  including  Etobicoke  and  Vaughn,  IKEA  North  York  retains   a  high-level  of  design  integrity  in  regards  to  the  standards  they  maintain  for  their  store   environment.     Additionally,  I  deliberately  chose  to  conduct  my  observations  in  IKEA  North  York's   Market  Hall,  which  is  a  warehouse  where  shoppers  pick  up  smaller  household  items  and   accessories,  rather  than  the  more  highly  stylized  Showroom  space,  because  consumer   patronage  intention  is  easier  to  observe  in  this  environment.  Although  IKEA  North  York   shoppers  browsing  in  the  Showroom  interact  with  displays,  their  intent  to  purchase  items      18  

is  not  entirely  clear  as  they  must  go  to  the  "Self  Serve"  area  to  pick  up  their  furniture  before   a  purchase  can  be  made.  In  contrast,  IKEA  North  York's  Market  Hall  is  set  up  like  a   traditional  store  where  shoppers  can  both  interact  with  product  displays  and  place  items   straight  into  bags  or  carts  for  purchase. b. Visual Analysis   In  order  to  decipher  the  information  gathered,  I  applied  concepts  from  document   design  to  conduct  a  visual  analysis  and  determine  the  success  of  the  visual  communication   in  IKEA  North  York's  product  displays.  My  MRP  draws  conclusions  between  the  data   collected  on  site  from  observing  purchasing  behaviour  and  analysis  of  the  visual  design  in   the  product  displays  to  assess  the  persuasive  messaging  in  IKEA  North  York's  retail   environment.  In  addition  to  visual  analysis,  I  completed  some  preliminary  analysis  on  site   when  I  conducted  observational  research  on  IKEA  North  York's  premises;  more  specifically,   I  translated  shoppers'  movement  patterns  to  their  purchase  intention  immediately  upon   my  observation.   c. Guiding Concepts for Visual Analysis I  used  a  pre-determined  specified  set  of  criteria  to  guide  my  visual  analysis  in  order   to  ensure  that  all  the  visual  elements  of  the  product  displays  were  studied  in  a  consistent   manner.  The  document  design  concepts  I  applied  include:  (i)  information  hierarchy,  (ii)   white  space,  (iii)  colour,  and  (iv)  ambience.  These  concepts  were  applied  to  three  product   displays  (FÄRGRIK,  LUGN/ÖPPEN,  and  FÖRNUFT)  from  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"   department  at  IKEA  North  York  through  visual  analysis  to  determine  the  overall   effectiveness  of  the  design  and  visual  communication  of  the  displays.  Both  2-dimensional   and  3-dimensional  elements  of  each  of  the  product  displays  were  examined  including      19  

signage,  display  structure,  and  location.  In  analyzing  each  of  the  product  displays  signage   represents  2D  visual  artifacts  while  the  display  structure  and  location  characterize  3D   documents.  Moreover,  these  concepts  guided  my  observations  while  conducting  research   at  IKEA  North  York.  These  four  concepts  were  chosen  because  they  represent  a  wide   spectrum  of  design  concepts  while  being  unique  theories  in  the  discipline.  Additionally,   although  I  approached  my  research  from  a  visual  analysis  perspective,  this  method  is  not   used  in  the  field  of  retail  design  and  visual  merchandising  thus  similar  studies  were  not   referenced  when  choosing  my  criteria  for  analysis.   i. Information Hierarchy    In  regards  to  document  design,  information  hierarchy,  or  visual  hierarchy,  refers  to   the  levels  of  emphasis  in  a  composition  (Bowers,  2008).  A  clear  hierarchy  of  information   can  be  accomplished  through  the  purposeful  placement  of  visual  and  typographical   information  based  on  relative  importance  and  the  organization  of  the  composition  of  a   page  to  create  a  sense  of  order  (Lascano,  2009).  Clear  information  hierarchy  provides  a   number  of  important  benefits.  Hierarchy  allows  for  the  understanding  of  complex   information  and  provides  a  method  of  guiding  the  viewer  through  content  as  it  clearly   identifies  important  visual  cues  (Bowers,  2008).  Bowers  (2008)  explains,  a  "form's   composition  can  emphasize  parts  of  information,  reveal  relationships  among  components,   and  guide  interpretation"  (p.  71).  Clear  information  hierarchy  in  documents  can  result  in  a   improved  of  legibility,  which  is  an  important  factor  as  it  allows  viewers  to  quickly  gain  an   understanding  of  the  content  being  displayed  and  determine  what  is  useful,  usable,  or   relevant  to  their  needs  (Lascano,  2009).  Information  hierarchies  organize,  prioritize,  and   communicate  visually  by  modifying  the  visual  weights  different  elements  carry.  

  

20  

Information  hierarchy  is  conveyed  visually  through  basic  elements  of  design   including  continuity,  contrast,  repetition,  alignment,  proximity,  and  scale  (Lascano,  2009).   Information  hierarchy  is  a  design  element  related  to  composition  and,  as  such,  includes   other  design  concepts  such  as  white  space  and  colour.  However,  unlike  these  individual   elements  of  design,  information  hierarchy  looks  at  the  overall  composition  of  a  document   to  determine  what  objects  are  most  salient  (Bowers,  2008).  Although  information   hierarchy  is  easy  to  identify  on  a  traditional  composition,  such  as  the  document  design  of  a   retail  sign,  all  forms  of  documents,  including  the  structure  of  a  product  display,  contain   hierarchical  elements.     ii. White Space "White  space",  also  known  as  negative  space,  is  an  element  of  design  that  is  part  of   the  aesthetics  of  composition.  In  A  Primer  of  Visual  Literacy,  Donis  A.  Dondis  (1973)   distinguishes  between  positive  and  negative  space.  Dondis  (1973)  states  that  "the   significance  of  positive  and  negative...means  merely  that  there  are  separate  yet  unified   elements  in  all  visual  events"  (p.  35).  Dondis  (1973)  emphasizes  that  "positive  and  negative   are  in  no  way  meant  to  describe  darkness  or  lightness  or  mirror  image  as  they  do  in  the   description  of  film  and  prints  in  photography"  (p.  35).  Rather,  in  design,  "what  dominates   the  eye  in  visual  experience  would  be  considered  the  positive  elements  while  those  more   passively  displayed  would  be  considered  negative"  (Dondis,  1973,  p.  35).     In  this  sense,  white  space  does  not  necessarily  mean  "blank  space";  rather,  it  refers   to  an  absence  of  visual  content.  White  space  can  be  literal  when  referring  to  the  design  of  a   document  such  as  a  retail  sign.  This  type  of  white  space  includes  the  portion  of  a  page  left   unmarked  in  the  overall  design  of  the  document;  more  specifically,  white  space  is  the  

  

21  

empty  space  between  graphics,  lines  of  type,  and  figures  and  objects  depicted  on  a  two- dimensional  plane.  White  space  is  not  limited  to  traditional  documents,  as  it  can  also  be   defined  as  the  gap  or  space  between  two  structural  parts  in  a  three-dimensional  document   such  as  a  product  display.     iii. Colour For  Dondis  (1973),  colour  is  an  element  of  design  that  is  "loaded  with  information   and  one  of  the  most  pervasive  visual  experiences  we  all  have  in  common"  (p.  50).   Therefore,  colour  is  "an  invaluable  source  for  visual  communicators...[as]  each  colour  has   many  meanings,  associative  and  symbolic"  (Dondis,  1973,  p.  50).  According  to  John  Bowers   (2003),  author  of  Introduction  to  Two-Dimensional  Design:  Understanding  Form  and   Function,  "our  understanding  of  a  form's  colour  is  influenced  by  variables,  including  the   type  and  intensity  of  the  lighting  on  the  object  viewed,  our  distance  from  it,  learned  colour   associations,  and  surrounding  colours"  (p.  89).  Therefore,  Bowers'  (2003)  claims,  "the   definition  of  colour  is  relative  and  dependent  on  cultural  and  physical  contexts"  (p.  89).   Characteristics  of  colour  include  hue,  tonal  value  (or  brightness),  intensity  (or  saturation),   and  temperature  (Dondis,  1973;  Bowers,  2003).  Colour  is  an  element  of  design  that  is  easy   to  apply  to  both  two  and  three-dimensional  documents;  but,  the  commercial  lighting  in   retail  environments  often  skews  the  true  nature  of  colours,  which  must  be  taken  into   consideration.     iv. Ambience Ambience,  in  the  context  of  my  MRP,  refers  to  the  atmospheric  qualities  that  border   a  product  display.  In  regards  to  retail  design  and  visual  merchandising,  ambience  can  also   be  defined  as  `atmospherics',  a  term  coined  by  Kotler  (1974)  who  stated  that  store  

  

22  

atmosphere  and  retail  spaces  could  be  intentionally  designed  and  given  environmental   cues  to  produce  specific  psychological  and  emotional  effects  in  shoppers.  These  retail   design  elements  and  environmental  cues  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  neighboring   displays,  location,  wall  colour,  lighting,  and  other  elements  of  visual  branding  that  are  not  a   part  of  the  structure  of  a  product  display  itself  (Kotler,  1974).  These  environmental   surroundings  provide  contextual  information  for  the  design  of  a  product  display,  which  can   aid  in  understanding  why  shoppers  behave  a  certain  way  when  faced  with  a  particular   display  structure.  Unlike  the  other  concepts  that  will  be  applied  to  the  product  displays,   ambience  takes  a  much  more  macro  approach  in  that  it  looks  at  the  display  as  a  whole  in   the  context  of  design  of  the  entire  retail  space.     d. Observation I  employed  consumer  observation  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  products   displays  at  IKEA  North  York.  While  a  significant  amount  of  research  has  been  done  on  the   effects  of  various  visual  cues  on  consumer  behaviour,  observational  research  is  not   typically  used  in  this  area  of  research.  In  the  past,  researchers  have  used  a  diverse  array  of   strategies  including:  focus  groups  (Law,  Wong,  &  Yip,  2012),  videotapes  used  to  simulate  a   store  environment  experience  followed  by  a  questionnaire  (Baker,  Parasuraman,  Grewal,  &   Voss,  2002),  ordering  photographs  of  retail  environments  based  on  specific  criteria  (Gilboa,   &  Rafael,  2003),  semi-structured  interviews  based  around  the  use  of  visual  stimulus   material  (Kerfoot,  Davies,  Ward,  2003),  and  questionnaires  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale  (Tai   &  Fung,  1997).    

  

23  

I  observed  consumer  behaviour  at  three  different  types  of  product  displays  in  the   "Cookshop  &  Tableware"  department  in  the  Market  Hall  of  IKEA  North  York.  These  three   display  types  consisted  of:      1      "Breathtaking  Item"   (BTI)         "Breathtaking  Items",  are  practical  and  extremely   low-cost  products  found  in  IKEA  North  York's   Market  Hall.  BTIs  are  heavily  promoted  on  the  retail   floor  to  encourage  impulse  purchases  due  to  the   inexpensive  nature  of  the  products.  BTI  product   displays  can  be  identified  easily  as  they  are  placed  in   prominent  locations  on  the  retail  floor,  or  "hot   spots",  and  their  product  displays  often  have  added   visual  elements.           A  "New  Lower  Price"  product  is  IKEA  North  York's   version  of  a  sale,  or  heavily  discounted,  product.   Product  displays  include  signage  that  clearly  states   "New  Lower  Price".           This  type  of  display  can  be  used  for  a  wide-range  of   products.  The  display's  distinguishing  features  are   that  its  signage  and  structure  are  extremely  simple,   predominantly  white,  and  lack  any  additional   graphic  elements.

   While  I  knew  the  type  of  product  displays  in  the  Market  Hall  before  my  observations   began,  the  exact  displays  were  not  decided  upon  until  my  site  visit.  Due  to  the  constantly   changing  nature  of  IKEA  North  York's  product  displays,  it  was  impossible  to  select  a   specific  display  ahead  of  my  observation  dates.  On  my  first  day  of  observations,  I  chose  the   following  product  displays:  FÄRGRIK,  LUGN/ÖPPEN,  and  FÖRNUFT,  which  represent  a  BTI,   New  Lower  Price,  and  Simple/White  product  displays  respectively  (see  Figure  1).           24  

Figure  1:  Breathtaking  Item,  New  Lower  Price,  and  Simple/White  product  displays  

   I  examined  shopper's  interactions  at  each  of  the  three  displays  for  an  hour  over  a   period  of  two  days  in  the  same  week.  Table  1  refers  to  observation  dates  and  times.  My   observation  period  began  around  10:00am,  as  I  wanted  to  observe  consumer  behaviour   immediately  after  IKEA  North  York  opened  when  each  of  the  product  displays  were  be  in   their  intended  configuration.  Each  morning  IKEA  North  York  staff  members  go  through   every  department  and  conduct  what  they  call  "SISAN",  or  "Store  In  Shape  As  New",  which   means  that  the  displays  are  put  into  correct  order  before  shoppers  arrive.  As  my  MRP   focuses  on  the  visual  nature  and  design  qualities  of  these  displays,  it  was  pertinent  that  the   displays  were  in  pristine  condition.  By  choosing  consistent  times  for  my  observations,  and   consecutive  observation  days,  I  maintained  control  over  external  variables  that  could  have   altered  consumer  behaviour.  I  assumed  that  shoppers  would  behave  similarly  over  the   same  period  of  time  in  the  same  week,  which  allowed  me  to  collect  a  considerable  amount   of  consistent  data.

   Throughout  my  observation  periods  I  varied  my  observation  location  in  order  to   gain  insight  from  different  visual  points  of  view.  Due  to  ethical  and  privacy  reasons,  I  did   not  interact  with  any  of  the  shoppers  I  observed.  In  my  fieldwork,  my  role  as  an  observer  at   IKEA  North  York  took  a  passive,  participant-as-observer  and  ethnographic  approach.  Due   to  the  purely  observational  nature  of  my  data  collection,  Ryerson  University's  Research   Ethics  Board  deemed  research  approval  unnecessary.  My  observation  field  notes   qualitatively  described  consumer  behaviour  around  each  display  in  addition  to  any  other   relevant  information  that  I  observed.  I  also  coded  shoppers'  consumer  behaviour  who   interacted  with  the  displays  based  on  a  3-point  scale  (see  Table  2)  to  quantify  the   effectiveness  of  each  display.  During  this  time,  I  began  preliminary  analysis  based  on  my   initial  impressions  of  consumer  behaviour  surrounding  each  display.     Table  2:  3-point  scale  for  coding  consumer  interaction  and  behaviour  at  IKEA

   e. Photo Documentation                   I  photo  documented  each  observed  product  display.  Each  product  display  was   photographed  from  multiple  angles;  but  because  the  majority  of  shoppers  saw  the  display   from  the  "Long  Natural  Way",  or  from  the  direction  of  the  store  aisle,  the  front  view  of  the   display  was  the  most  important.  As  well,  each  element  of  the  display  was  photographed  

  

26  

separately  including  signage,  product  package,  sample  or  test  products,  and  the  display   structure  itself.    Refer  to  Figures  3-24  (pages  32-71)  or  the  Appendix  for  photographs  of   each  of  the  product  displays.   f. Mapping In  order  to  proceed  with  the  visual  analysis,  I  created  a  map  of  the  "Cookshop  &   Tableware"  department  (see  Figure  2),  which  included  the  specific  location  of  each  of  the   observed  displays.  This  was  done  in  order  to  determine  the  importance  of  the  location  and   ambient  surroundings  of  each  of  the  displays  to  the  resultant  consumer  behaviour.  In   addition  to  creating  my  own  map,  I  collected  a  map  of  IKEA  North  York's  entire  retail  store   from  the  research  site.

7. Observation Results
Coding  shopper's  interactions  on  a  3-point  scale  allowed  for  a  quantifiable  way  to   measure  the  success  of  each  of  the  observed  product  displays  (refer  to  Table  3).  While   simply  garnering  attention  to  a  specific  product  display  is  important  in  the  retail   environment,  which,  in  this  research  study,  is  defined  as  looking  at  or  touching  the  product   display,  the  number  of  sales  of  the  product  determines  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the   product  display.  The  success  rate  of  each  of  the  product  displays  is  based  on  the  total   number  of  intended  purchases,  or  the  third  point  on  the  three-point  scale  referring  to  the   number  of  customers  who  placed  the  product  in  their  cart  or  bag  with  the  intention  of   purchasing  it,  and  the  total  number  of  interactions  after  2  hours  at  each  display  (see  Table   4).     Table  3:  3-point  scale  for  coding  consumer  interaction  and  behaviour  at  IKEA  North  York

   From  data  collected  from  the  research  site  it  is  clear  that  0.00%  of  shoppers  who   interacted  in  some  way  with  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  had  any  intention  of  purchasing   the  product.  In  contrast,  only  0.05%  of  shoppers  intended  to  buy  the  product  at  the   FÖRNUFT  display.  Despite  the  lowest  number  of  total  interactions,  67,  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN   product  display  was  the  most  successful  in  garnering  potential  sales  as  10.45%  of  shoppers   who  interacted  with  the  display  intended  to  purchase  the  product.

   Despite  having  the  lowest  success  rate,  the  FÄRGRIK  display  achieved  the  highest   number  of  visual  responses  or  the  first  point  on  the  three-point  scale.  That  is,  105  shoppers   in  IKEA  North  York's  Market  Hall  looked  at  the  FÄRGRIK  display's  signage  or  display  over   two  days  (see  Table  5).  In  contrast,  the  FÖRNUFT  display  received  only  89  visual   responses  while  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  resulted  in  a  meager  39  visual  responses.   Although  the  FÄRGRIK  display  received  the  highest  number  of  visual  responses  from   shoppers,  no  one  in  the  two-day  observation  period  actually  intended  to  purchase  the   product.  However,  despite  having  lower  visual  response  totals,  both  the  FÖRNUFT  and   LUGN/ÖPPEN  displays  were  generally  more  successful  in  garnering  sales.  Therefore,  based   purely  on  the  data  collected  from  observing  shoppers,  there  does  not  seem  to  be  a  direct   correlation  between  shoppers  who  simply  viewed  the  product  display  and  those  who   intended  to  purchase  the  product.

One  contributing  factor  that  could  have  affected  the  quantity  of  intended  purchases   is  the  number  of  shoppers  who  touched  the  product  or  display  on  the  retail  floor.  The   LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  was  the  most  successful  display  in  garnering  sales,  but  it  also   received  the  highest  number  of  tactile  responses  at  21    (refer  to  Table  5).  In  contrast,  the   FÖRNUFT  display  received  18  tactile  responses  followed  by  FÄRGRIK  at  17.  From  these   results  it  is  possible  that  the  display  that  garners  the  most  attention  from  shoppers  through   its  visual  design  does  not  necessarily  result  in  follow  through  from  the  shopper.  More   importantly,  it  appears  as  though  the  product  display  needs  to  be  designed  to  attract   shoppers'  tactile  responses  because,  according  to  the  data  collected,  shoppers  who  touch   the  product  display  are  more  likely  to  purchase  the  product.

   Information  hierarchy,  white  space,  and  colour  are  all  employed  in  the  FÄRGRIK,  

LUGN/ÖPPEN,  and  FÖRNUFT  product  displays  in  the  Market  Hall  of  IKEA  North  York  for   the  2-dimensional  retail  signage  and  in  the  3-dimensional  display  structure.  Furthermore,   each  of  the  product  displays  can  be  examined  as  a  whole  for  ambient  qualities  in  the   context  of  the  retail  environment,  rather  than  for  each  of  its  individual  parts.

a. FÄRGRIK i. Signage (2D) Figure  1:  FÄRGRIK  product  display  signs      There  are  two  signs  above  the   FÄRGRIK  product  display  (see  Figure  1).   The  first  sign  includes  information  on  the   product  type,  product  name,  the  color  and   material  of  the  product,  and  the  product   price.  The  second  sign  repeats  the   information  from  the  first  sign,  but  does   not  contain  the  price,  and  also  includes  a   graphic  illustration  of  the  items  inside  the   product  package  along  with  a  written   description  of  the  contents.        Both  signs  are  completely  void  of  colour;  yet,  the  contrast  between  the  stark  black   and  white  elements  adds  to  the  visual  hierarchy  of  signage.  As  the  signs  themselves  are   white,  any  absence  of  visual  content,  whether  typographical  or  image-related,  can  be   construed  as  white  space.  More  specifically,  white  space  used  in  both  of  these  signs  is  the   empty  space  between  the  lines  of  type  and  graphics,  which  is  left  purposefully  unmarked.   Due  to  the  abundance  of  white  spaces  in  both  signs,  the  information  hierarchy  is  made  very   clear  as  certain  elements  in  the  signs  are  highlighted  by  the  exaggerated  negative  space  in   the  composition.

Figure  2:  First  FÄRGRIK  sign  with  white  space  identified      In  the  first  sign,  white  space   can  be  seen  between  the  start  of  the   sign  and  the  first  three  lines  of  text,   between  this  text  and  the  large  price   tag,  and  between  the  price  tag  and  the   IKEA  logo  (refer  to  Figure  2).  These   equal  instances  of  white  space  act  as   visual  breaks  to  allow  for  the   presented  information  to  become   more  understood  by  the  viewer,   adding  value  to  content  and  greater   information  comprehension  (Strong,   1926).    In  this  sign,  white  space  is   used  to  emphasize  particular   segments  of  information.      

  

33  

   Figure  3:  1st  FÄRGRIK  sign  with  identification  of  information  hierarchy      Information  in  each  of  these  segments  is   further  emphasized  through  creating  visual   hierarchy  (see  Figure  3).  For  instance,  in  the  first   text  block  the  word  "FÄRGRIK"  is  capitalized,   bolded,  and  significantly  larger  than  the  other   lines  of  text  surrounding  it.  Using  these   typographical  elements,  and  increasing  the  scale   of  the  text,  the  product  name  is  made  more   prominent  in  the  sign    (Spencer,  Reynolds,  and   Coe,  1974).  By  exaggerating  the  size  of  these   prices,  this  important  information  is  highlighted.   By  modifying  the  visual  weight  in  different   graphical  elements  on  this  sign,  information,  such   as  the  product  name  and  price  is  visually   prioritized.  Without  having  to  add  color  or  any   additional  graphics,  this  retail  sign  prominently   displays  the  name  and  price  of  the  product  being  sold.  As  the  price  appears  to  be  the   "selling  point"  of  this  product,  this  number  is  surrounded  by  copious  amounts  of  white   space  and  has  been  increased  in  scale  in  order  to  avoid  distraction  from  this  important   piece  of  information.           34  

Figure  4:  2nd  FÄRGRIK  sign  with  identification  of  white  space  and  information  hierarchy      The  second  sign  (see   Figure  4),  while  still   displaying  evidence  of   negative  space,  has   considerably  less  white   space  and  differences  in   scale  than  the  first  sign   due,  in  part,  to  the   significantly  smaller  visual   plane  of  the  sign.   However,  white  space  and   information  hierarchy  are  still   evident  in  more  subtle,  yet  still   effective,  forms.     For  instance,  in  comparison  to  the  overall  composition  of  the  sign,  the  graphic   illustration  is  the  largest  visual  element  on  the  2-dimensional  plane.  As  such,  the  relative   importance  of  this  graphic  is  naturally  higher  than  the  textual  elements  of  the  sign   (Lascano,  2009).  The  use  of  white  space  in  this  sign  also  prioritizes  the  graphic  illustration   of  the  product  contents  over  the  sign's  textual  elements.  The  large  amount  of  white  space   above  the  graphic  illustration  of  the  side  and  dinner  plates  isolates  the  product  drawing  in   the  context  of  the  sign  as  a  whole.  As  well,  the  use  of  bold  typography  both  above  and  

  

35  

below  the  graphic  illustration  frames  the  graphic,  which  creates  a  sense  of  order  in  the  sign   (Spencer,  Reynolds,  and  Coe,  1974).  As  such,  the  graphic  illustration  stands  out  to   shoppers,  while  the  text  and  the  IKEA  logo  recede  to  the  background.        Figure  5:  White  space  in  the  graphic  illustration  from  the  2nd  FÄRGRIK  sign  

Although  there  is  an  insignificant  amount  of  white  space  in  between  the  text  and  the   graphic  illustration  in  this  sign,  the  graphic  illustration  of  the  dinnerware  set  itself  contains   white  space  (refer  to  Figure  5).  The  three  types  of  dinnerware  in  the  product  package  are   displayed  prominently  on  the  sign  through  simple  line  drawings,  which  indicate  both  the   product  type  and  the  quantity.  Each  of  these  products  is  stacked  into  columns  that  are   separated  by  white  space.  The  use  of  white  space  in  this  instance  indicates  the  variety  of      36  

products  to  the  shopper  because  it  is  made  extremely  clear,  through  negative  space  in  the   sign,  that  there  are  three  different  types  of  dinnerware  in  the  product  set.  This  is  an   important  element  of  the  product  being  sold  because  it  informs  the  reader  of  the  wide   range  of  items  in  the  product  set,  which  is  not  visually  displayed  through  the  product   packaging  itself.  Therefore,  IKEA  North  York  must  rely  on  this  sign,  in  particular,  to  notify   shoppers  of  the  true  nature  of  the  FÄRGRIK  package's  contents.     It  is  clear  that  white  space  and  information  hierarchy  in  the  signs  for  the  FÄRGRIK   product  display  are  strategically  used  to  emphasize  important  points  of  visual  information   (Bowers,  2008).  In  the  first  sign,  the  price  stands  out,  while,  in  the  second  sign,  the  product   graphic  illustration  is  prioritized.  In  using  white  space  and  information  hierarchy  for  this   purpose,  IKEA  North  York  is  attempting  to  communicate  key  points  of  information  to   casual  shoppers  in  the  store.  Based  on  my  observed  data,  customers  did  not  all  stop  to  look   at  the  display  as  a  whole,  most  will  absorb  pertinent  information  from  this  well-designed   retail  sign.  Observational  results  indicated  that  while  many  customers  walked  directly  past   the  display,  a  total  of  105  shoppers  looked  directly  at  the  display  before  continuing  on   through  the  retail  space.  These  results  show  that  the  effective  use  of  white  space  and   information  hierarchy  in  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  signs  successfully  leads  to  attracting   shopper's  attention  (Strong,  1926).  While  it  appears  as  though  the  FÄRGRIK  signage  was   successful  in  garnering  shoppers'  attention,  it  appears  as  though  something  in  the  design  of   the  display  itself  failed  to  gain  their  patronage  intention  as  only  17  shoppers  touched  the   display  and  none  intended  to  buy  the  product.

ii. Product Display Structure (3D) White  space  and  information  hierarchy  are  not  limited  to  traditional  documents.   White  space  can  also  be  defined  as  the  pause  or  space  between  structural  parts  in  a  three- dimensional  document  such  as  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  and  elements  of  information   hierarchy,  such  as  contrast  and  scale,  can  be  seen  in  all  forms  of  visual  communication.        Figure  6:  FÄRGRIK  product  display

   Figure  7:  FÄRGRIK  product  display  close-up  with  white  space  identified  

Table  Shelf  

   The  design  of  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  (refer  to  Figure  6)  contains  many   instances  of  white  space,  which  are  achieved  through  the  use  of  gaps  in  the  display   structure  (see  Figure  7).  For  instance,  the  retail  signs,  as  discussed  above,  hang  from  the   ceiling  and  appear  to  float  above  the  base  of  the  display.  As  such,  white  space  is  created   between  each  of  the  signs  and  between  the  signs  and  the  base  of  the  display,  which  allows   for  a  visual  pause  for  shoppers  before  they  look  at  the  display  structure.  The  FÄRGRIK   product  display  signs  are  large  and  white  and  contain  little  visual  information.  Therefore,  

  

39  

these  signs,  in  addition  to  the  space  surrounding  the  signs,  act  as  white  space  in  the  design   of  the  display  as  a  whole.      Additionally,  comparable  to  the  use  of  floating  signs,  white  space  is  created  in  the  

FÄRGRIK  product  display  through  the  use  of  a  similarly  suspended  table  shelf.  This  table   allows  for  products  to  be  displayed  outside  their  product  packaging  and  it  is  surrounded  by   white  space,  which  emphasizes  the  products  on  view  (see  Figure  7).  By  surrounding  this   table,  the  positive  element  in  the  display  structure,  with  empty  space  the  table  display  is   highlighted.  Although  the  simple  floating  table  structure  is  a  subtle  design  element,  the   white  space  that  results  from  the  floating  configuration  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the   table  and  the  products  sitting  upon  it.  This  table  display  clearly  persuades  shoppers  to   interact  with  the  product  as  17  shoppers  had  tactile  responses  to  the  display.      Although  the  use  of  white  space  around  both  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  signs  and  

table  display  highlight  important  information  with  the  subsequent  result  of  encouraging   consumer  behaviour,  the  display,  as  a  whole,  was  ineffective  in  enticing  purchases  from   shoppers.  My  observations  indicate  that,  despite  the  display's  success  in  garnering  short- term  attention  to  the  purchase  of  the  product,  no  one,  in  the  two-hour  span  over  two  days   in  which  I  observed,  picked  up  a  product  with  the  intention  of  buying  it.  It  is  possible  that   this  display,  in  its  entirety,  contained  excessive  white  space,  which  left  little  visual  interest   to  attract  shoppers.  Although  small  amounts  of  white  space  resulted  in  garnering  attention   for  both  the  retail  signs  and  the  table  display,  when  examining  the  complete  FÄRGRIK   product  display,  the  overall  appearance  of  the  display  is  dull  and  lacks  overall  aesthetic   appeal.

Figure  8:  Information  hierarchy  in  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display     

The  entire  display  also  lacks  a  clear  hierarchy  of  information  due  to  the  absence  of   contrast  (see  Figure  8).  For  instance,  the  base  display  that  contains  many  product   packages  lies  below  the  table  display.  These  packages  contain  considerably  more  negative   than  positive  space  and  through  the  repetitive  nature  of  stacked  products,  added  amounts  

  

41  

of  white  space  were  present  in  the  structure  of  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  (refer  to   Figure  9).  By  having  significantly  more  white  space  than  visual  content  in  each  of  the   product  packages,  in  addition  to  the  stark  white  products  themselves,  the  product  display   design  becomes  unbalanced.  The  lack  of  contrast  in  the  display,  achieved  through  the   overuse  of  white  and  repetitive  visual  elements,  results  in  a  lack  of  salience  in  the  display's   overall  composition.  As  such,  shoppers  cannot  differentiate  or  prioritize  the  information  in   the  display  because  all  of  the  visual  elements  blend  together  with  no  particular  element   standing  out.  Shoppers  cannot  effectively  navigate  the  display's  content  or  find  useful   information,  which  might  be  why  most  leave  the  display  after  a  short  period  of  time.  During   my  observations,  I  noted  that  a  customer  had  significant  trouble  determining  the  number   of  products  contained  in  the  FÄRGRIK  product  package.  This  shopper  actually  attempted  to   count  the  number  of  plates  and  bowls  inside  the  sealed  package,  rather  than  refer  to  the   signs  that  clearly  and  effectively  indicated  the  number  and  type  of  products  being  sold.  The   strategic  use  of  white  space  and  information  hierarchy  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of   each  of  the  display  signs;  but,  the  scale  of  the  signs  could  be  improved  to  make  important   information  more  prominent  in  the  display  structure  and  overall  retail  space.   Figure  9:  Predominantly  white  FÄRGRIK  display  base

Individually,  the  parts  of  the  display,  such  as  the  signs,  use  white  space  and   information  hierarchy  somewhat  effectively  to  draw  attention  to  important  information   such  as  price,  product  content,  and  sample  products;  however,  the  entire  display  contains   an  unbalanced  amount  of  white  space  with  a  significant  lack  of  contrast,  in  both  tone  and   scale,  for  the  overall  composition.     iii. Location and Ambience (3D) In  the  context  of  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"  department  as  a  whole,  the  FÄRGRIK   product  display  exists  as  an  instance  of  white  space.  Just  as  white  space  emphasizes   elements  in  the  positive  space  of  the  display,  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  calls  attention  to   the  other  displays  surrounding  it.  White  space  on  a  two-dimensional  plane  allows  for  a   visual  break  for  the  viewer  or  a  pause  before  more  important  information  is  introduced.   Likewise,  the  placement  and  design  of  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  in  the  "Cookshop  &   Tableware"  department  in  the  Market  Hall  of  IKEA  North  York  might  have  been  done   purposefully  to  attract  attention  to  what  the  store  deemed  "more  important"  products.     Ambient  and  atmospheric  elements  surrounding  the  display  emphasize  the   simplistic,  white  colour  of  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display.  For  instance,  three  pot  lights  point   directly  at  the  base  of  the  display  structure.  These  lights  accentuate  the  bright  white  nature   of  the  display  in  the  context  of  the  Market  Hall  at  IKEA  North  York.  Additionally,  IKEA   North  York  chose  to  place  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  directly  beside  a  more  "showroom- like"  visual  merchandised  table  display  (see  Figure  10).  This  neighboring  display  was   designed  to  look  like  someone's  patio  with  furniture,  tableware,  and  other  decorative   elements  and  accessories.  In  comparison  to  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display,  the  showroom- like  table  display  has  significantly  more  color  and  its  layout  is  more  conducive  to  tactile

responses  and  petting  due  to  its  use  of  a  familiar  piece  of  furniture.  As  well,  the  scale  of  the   display  is  more  varied  with  larger  signs  and  large  panels  of  color,  which  also  greatly   reduces  the  amount  of  white  space  in  the  display.  The  table  display  contrasts  with  the   FÄRGRIK  product  display,  which  increases  its  prominence  in  the  retail  space.  As  such,  the   FÄRGRIK  product  display  further  recedes  in  the  Market  Hall  and  receives  less  overall   attention  from  shoppers.  By  placing  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  next  to  a  more  visually   interesting  display  in  the  Market  Hall,  IKEA  North  York  is  clearly  using  another  technique   to  detract  attention  away  from  FÄRGRIK.   Figure  10:  Highly-designed  competitive  display  beside  FÄRGRIK

   As  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  is  among  the  first  few  displays  in  the  introductory   department  of  the  Market  Hall  it  is  almost  guaranteed  that  the  display  will  be  ignored.  See   Figure  2  for  a  map  of  IKEA  North  York's  Market  Hall.  Techniques  of  retail  geography  must   be  used  prior  to  visitors  entering  a  store  so  that  the  retail  experience  is  successful  from  the   start.  Shoppers  need  a  landing  strip  before  they  cross  the  threshold  of  a  store,  a  time  to   adjust  to  various  external  elements  such  as  lighting  and  environmental  changes.  Underhill   (1999)  calls  this  space  the  Transition  Zone,  or  Decompression  Zone,  and  it  must  be   effectively  utilized  by  a  store  to  ease  consumers  into  the  retail  environment.  According  to   Underhill  (1999),  "allowing  some  space  between  the  entrance  of  a  store  and  a  product   gives  it  more  time  in  the  shopper's  eye  as  he  or  she  approaches  it.  It  builds  a  little  visual   anticipation"  in  the  consumer  (p.50).  Shoppers  need  to  orient  themselves  in  the   environment  of  the  Market  Hall  and  therefore  will  most  likely  be  unable  to  digest  any  of  the   items  that  are  displayed  immediately  upon  their  arrival.  As  such,  the  design  of  the  FÄRGRIK   product  display  reflects  the  fact  that  the  product  is  possibly  not  supposed  to  be  noticed.   Rather,  by  composing  the  entire  FÄRGRIK  product  display  as  an  instance  of  white  space  in   the  department,  the  display  acts  a  precursor  to  the  rest  of  the  store.   IKEA  North  York  appears  to  use  elements  of  design  to  persuade  its  shoppers  to   avoid  purchasing  FÄRGRIK  products  through  the  visual  elements  of  the  retail  display.   Rather  than  use  the  design  of  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  to  incite  purchases,  IKEA  North   York  seems  to  overuse  design  strategies  to  draw  attention  away  from  a  low  priority   product  to  an  item  of  more  value.  As  such,  while  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  was   strategically  designed,  its  visual  messages  sought  to  evade  shoppers'  attention.         45  

iv.  FÄRGRIK Visual Analysis Summary    Information   Hierarchy      Signage  
o o Information  hierarchy  is  made  clear  through  the  effective  use  of  white   space.   Use  of  exaggerated  scale  and  modifying  visual  weights  of  graphic  and   textual  elements  prioritizes  product  price.  

   Product  Display  Structure  
o o The  entire  display  lacks  a  clear  hierarchy  of  information  due  to  the   absence  of  contrast  caused  by  the  overuse  of  white  and  repetitive  visual   elements.   Results  in  a  lack  of  salience  in  the  display's  overall  composition;  therefore,   shoppers  cannot  differentiate  or  prioritize  information  in  the  display.     

   White  Space  

   Signage  
o White  space  is  used  to  emphasize  particular  segments  of  information   including  product  price  and  product  diversity  through  the  graphic   illustration.  

   Product  Display  Structure  
o o White  space  exists  in  the  gaps  of  the  display.   The  display  self  and  signs,  the  positive  elements  in  the  display  which  are   surrounded  by  white  space,  are  emphasized.     

   Colour  

   Product  Display  Structure  
o The  display  is  primarily  white  and  void  of  colour,  as  such,  the  display  acts   as  an  instance  of  white  space  on  the  retail  floor.     

   Ambience  

   Location  
o The  FÄRGRIK  product  display  calls  attention  to  the  other  displays   surrounding  it  due  to  its  lack  of  visual  interest  in  the  Market  Hall.  

   Ambience  
o o Pot  lights  pointed  at  the  FÄRGRIK  display  emphasize  its  bright,  white   nature.     Neighbouring  "showroom-like"  display  detracts  shopper  attention  away   from  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display.

b. FÖRNUFT i. Signage (2D) Figure  11:  FÖRNUFT  signage   There  is  a  single  sign  above  the   FÖRNUFT  product  display  (Figure  11).   This  sign  clearly  indicates  that  the  product   is  a  "New  Lower  Price"  due  to  the  bold   graphic  at  the  top  of  the  sign,  the  sign  also   includes  information  on  the  product  name,   the  product  type,  the  number  of  objects   contained  within  the  product  package,  and   the  product  price.  The  use  of  the  colour  red   in  the  sign  directs  attention  to  the  "New   Lower  Price"  graphic  on  the  sign.  While   white  space  and  aspects  of  information   hierarchy  emphasize  important  pieces  of   information  on  the  sign  (Bowers,  2008).

   Figure  12:  "New  Lower  Price"  graphic     

The  only  use  of  colour,  another  than  black  and  white,  is  in  the  graphic  at  the  top  of   the  FÖRNUFT  sign  (refer  to  Figure  12).  A  large  red  rectangle  is  used  as  a  bright  and   colorful  backdrop  for  the  information  that  is  placed  over  it.  By  using  colour  in  this  manner,   the  design  of  the  sign  strategically  highlights  a  key  piece  of  information  to  shoppers.  As   well,  as  many  of  the  signs  in  the  Market  Hall  do  not  include  much  colour,  this  simple   graphic  element  makes  the  sign  stand  out  to  shoppers.  The  use  of  red  has  many  cultural   connotations;  for  instance,  in  the  retail  environment  red  often  denotes  a  sense  of  urgency   and  is  more  physically  stimulating  (Bellizzi,  Crowley,  and  Hasty,  1983).  As  well,  Bellizzi,   Crowley,  and  Hasty  (1983)  found  that  red    "lends  [itself]  to  application  in  retail  settings   where  unplanned  (impulse)  buying  by  customers  is  found"  (p.  41),  as  such,  red  can  be  seen   as  the  indicative  colour  of  a  "sale"  or  discounted  product.  By  using  this  specific  colour  on   the  sign,  shoppers  immediately  understand  that  a  value-based  product  is  being  sold   without  actually  having  to  read  any  of  the  information  on  the  sign.

As  well,  the  use  of  red  aids  in  the  contrast  of  the  sign  as  the  information  placed  over   the  red  rectangle  stands  out  resulting  in  a  high  degree  of  legibility  (Dondis,  1973).  This  is   important  factor  as  it  allows  viewers  to  quickly  gain  an  understanding  of  the  content  being   displayed.  White  space  in  the  graphic,  unlike  in  the  sign  for  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display,  is   not  literally  white.  Rather  the  space  between  the  "New  Lower  Price"  block  of  text  and  the   edge  of  the  sign  is  red.  Again,  this  adds  to  the  stand  out  quality  of  the  "New  Lower  Price"   graphic.  Lastly,  the  text  in  the  graphic  is  bold,  capitalized,  and  has  an  angled  orientation.   These  compositional  elements  add  contrast  to  the  graphic,  and  the  sign  as  a  whole,  and   therefore  place  the  graphic  higher  on  the  information  hierarchy  of  the  sign.        Figure  13:  FÖRNUFT  signage  with  white  space  and   information  hierarchy      Although  the  rest  of  the  sign  does  not  include  any  

colour,  white  space  and  elements  of  information   hierarchy  are  used  to  prioritize  certain  pieces  of   information  that  are  most  pertinent  to  shoppers.  As   indicated  by  the  well-designed  "New  Lower  Price"   graphic,  the  selling  feature  of  FÖRNUFT  appears  to  be   price.  As  such,  both  white  space  and  scale  are  used  to   place  a  significant  amount  of  visual  importance  on  the   price  on  the  sign  (refer  to  Figure  13).  White  space  can  be   seen  between  the  first  three  lines  of  text  and  the  large   type  price  tag,  and  between  the  price  tag  and  the  single  

  

49  

line  of  text,  and  between  this  line  of  text  and  the  IKEA  logo.  These  unequal  instances  of   white  space  allow  for  the  reader  to  prioritize  the  price  of  the  product,  as  it  is  the  one  key   piece  of  information  in  the  sign  (Smith  and  McComb,  1971).  As  there  is  an  insignificant   amount  of  white  space  between  the  "New  Lower  Price"  graphic  and  the  first  segment  of   copy,  these  lines  of  text  do  not  stand  out.  Rather,  this  body  of  text  almost  blends  into  the   rest  of  the  sign  despite  the  presence  of  hierarchical  elements  including  bold  and  capitalized   typography  (Spencer,  Reynold,  and  Coe,  1974).  However,  a  large  segment  of  white  space   follows  the  body  of  text,  which  allows  for  ample  free  space  for  shoppers  to  read  this   information  (Smith  and  McComb,  1971).  Additionally,  the  price  is  extremely  large  in  the   context  of  the  overall  composition  of  the  sign  making  it  the  most  prominent  piece  of   information  for  shoppers.  The  significant  amounts  of  white  space  surrounding  the  price   and  the  exaggerated  use  of  scale  in  the  design  of  this  sign  allows  for  the  information   present  to  become  more  valuable  to  readers  (Strong,  1926).  Though,  the  final  line  in  the   sign  could  be  made  more  prominent  in  the  sign  as  it  is  currently  illegible  from  a  distance.   For  instance,  through  elements  of  information  hierarchy,  including  scale,  weight,  proximity,   or  colour,  the  display  could  be  made  more  visible  to  shoppers  as  this  line  of  text   emphasizes  the  value  and  current  price  of  the  product  (Bowers,  2008).  As  this  copy  is  not   adequately  emphasized  through  the  design  of  the  sign,  shoppers  are  unaware  of  what  could   be  an  equally  important  characteristic  of  the  product.  Regardless  of  this  small  shortfall,  the   FÖRNUFT  sign  clearly  identifies  important  visual  cues  through  colour,  white  space,  and   information  hierarchy.     The  design  of  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  sign  clearly  places  a  significant  amount   of  important  on  the  price  and  value  of  the  product.  This  is  evident  because  colour,  white  

  

50  

space,  and  elements  of  hierarchy  were  all  used  in  conjunction  with  one  another  to  place   visual  weight  on  the  "New  Lower  Price"  graphic  and  the  product  price.  This  conclusion  can   be  verified  from  observational  data  on  consumer  behaviour  surrounding  this  display.  I   noted  that  a  significant  number  of  customers  walked  directly  past  the  display  and  89  of   these  shoppers  looked  directly  at  the  display  before  continuing  on  through  the  Market  Hall.   Therefore,  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  sign  was  somewhat  successful  in  attracting   shopper's  attention;  still,  some  aspect  of  the  design  of  the  display  itself  was  able  to  garner   further  notice  from  shoppers  as  18  shoppers  touched  the  display  and  six  intended  to  buy   the  product.   ii. Product Display Structure (3D) Just  as  elements  of  design  can  be  used  to  emphasize  pertinent  pieces  of  information   to  shoppers  on  a  two-dimensional  plane,  they  can  also  be  used  for  the  same  purpose  on  a   three-dimensional  document  such  as  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  (see  Figure  14).  The   design  of  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  contains  many  instances  of  white  space,  which  are   achieved  through  the  use  of  gaps  in  the  display  structure.  Additionally,  scale  and  proximity   are  used  to  create  a  clear  hierarchy  of  information  in  the  product  display.     The  FÖRNUFT  product  display  contains  a  significant  amount  of  white  space  in  its   display  structure.  This  is,  in  part,  due  to  the  fact  that  at  the  time  of  observation  the  display   appeared  to  be  running  low  on  product  packages  and  was  generally  quite  "empty".   Regardless,  the  white  space  between  the  sign  and  the  table  shelf  is  about  half  the  size  of  the   space  between  the  table  shelf  and  the  boxes  of  product  packages  resting  on  the  display's   base.  In  theory,  by  framing  the  table  shelf  with  white  space,  the  table  shelf  should  stand  out  

  

51  

visually  to  viewers.  However,  the  table  shelf,  which  holds  sample  products  intended  to   entice  tactile  responses,  is  lost  amongst  the  display  structure.  This  is  due  to  the  scale  of  the     Figure  14:  White  space  and  information  hierarchy  in  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display

display  structure  as  the  table  shelf  is  too  small  and  innocuous  for  the  display  as  a  whole.   The  table  shelf  disappears  because  there  is  more  negative  than  positive  space  in  the  display   structure  and  therefore  the  positive  element  in  the  display,  the  table  shelf,  simply   disappears.  Therefore,  due  to  its  size  and  surroundings,  the  table  shelf  does  not  encourage   tactile  responses  from  shoppers.  In  fact,  from  my  observations  I  found  that  most  shoppers   interacted  with  the  product  packages  on  the  display  base  and  not  the  sample  products  on   the  table  shelf.  There  was  even  an  open  product  package  on  the  display  where  a  shopper   had  clearly  tried  to  get  a  closer  look  at  the  product,  as  they  obviously  did  not  see  the  table   shelf  with  samples  already  on  display.     Just  as  the  size  of  the  table  shelf  was  too  small  for  the  large  display,  the  scale  of  the   display's  signage  deemphasized  its  importance.  The  purpose  of  the  sign  is  to  both  attract   and  inform  shoppers  of  the  product  being  sold  at  the  display;  but,  while  the  sign  effectively   informs  shoppers,  its  small  size  cannot  be  seen  from  a  distance.  Additionally,  the  entire   display,  which  is  large  and  quite  clunky  in  nature,  overwhelms  the  sign  in  the  overall   composition  of  the  display  structure.  The  weight  of  the  display  structure  appears   unbalanced  because  there  is  more  substance  at  the  bottom  of  the  display  due  to  the  large   amount  of  white  packages  on  the  display  base.  These  packages  stood  out  due  to  the  stark   contrast  between  them  and  the  rest  of  the  display  structure,  in  which  the  Market  Hall  acts   as  the  backdrop.  Additionally,  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  has  issues  regarding  the   proximity  of  its  visual  elements,  which  detract  from  the  display's  message.  The  distance   between  the  sign  and  the  products  is  too  great  due  to  the  "empty"  nature  of  the  display  and   the  extremely  small  nature  of  the  signage,  Therefore,  even  if  shoppers  were  attracted  to  the  

  

53  

sign  on  its  own,  this  attraction  did  not  always  translate  to  increased  interaction  with  the   display  as  the  structural  elements  of  the  display  are  visually  disconnected.      Scale,  weight,  proximity,  and  white  space  are  used  in  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  

to  create  a  hierarchy  of  information.  However,  these  elements  may  not  have  been  used  in   an  advantageous  manner.  Therefore,  although  there  is  a  clear  hierarchy  of  information  in   the  FÖRNUFT  product  display,  the  visually  heavy  display  base,  not  the  signage  or  the  table   shelf,  are  the  most  prominent  segments  of  the  entire  composition.     iii.

Just  as  with  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display,  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display,  in  the   context  of  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"  department,  is  not  very  effective  in  part  due  to  its   ambient  qualities  including  location  and  retail  context  (see  Figure  15).        Figure  16:  `Fork'  and  FÖRNUFT  product  display  in  the  Market  Hall   The  FÖRNUFT   product  display  is  located  at   a  "fork"  in  the  "Long  Natural   Way",  or  intended  route  in   the  aisle,  in  the  "Cookshop   and  Tableware"  department   (refer  to  Figure  16).   Therefore,  due  to  the   display's  location,  most   shoppers  are  forced  to   confront  the  display  head  on.   Nevertheless,  most  likely  due   to  the  design  display   structure  and  the  size  and   location  of  the  signage,   during  my  observations  I   noticed  that  shoppers  often   walked  right  past  the  display  

  

55  

without  paying  any  attention  to  it.  The  location  of  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  is  ideal   because  it  essentially  forces  shoppers  to  pass  the  display  due  to  its  location,  which  is   adjacent  to  the  main  aisle.  However,  despite  the  ideal  location,  the  display's  structure  failed   to  garner  a  considerable  amount  of  consumer  notice.    Additionally,  I  noticed  that  despite   the  intended  wayfinding  trajectory  of  the  Market  Hall  and  the  "Long  Natural  Way",  many   shoppers  approached  the  display  from  the  side  or  from  the  main  aisle,  rather  than  the  foot   of  the  fork.  Furthermore,  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display's  signage  in  particular  does  not   accommodate  for  viewing  from  multiple  perspectives.  Hence,  the  ideal  display  location  is   wasted  on  a  product  display  with  multiple  design  shortcomings.     While  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  location  was  successful,  the  display's  retail   context  and  surrounding  environment  pulled  the  focus  away  from  this  "New  Lower  Price"   product.  A  BTI  was  located  directly  behind  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display,  which  included  a   large  red  panel  and  sign,  similar  to  that  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display.  Although  IKEA  North   York  prioritizes  BTIs  by  placing  them  in  hot  spots  throughout  the  retail  floor  and  adding   additional  graphic  elements  to  the  display,  the  close  proximity  of  the  BTI  detracted   attention  from  the  FÖRNUFT  display.  In  fact,  during  my  observations  I  noticed  that  many   shoppers  walked  right  past  the  FÖRNUFT  display  because  they  were  immediately  attracted   to  the  BTI  display  right  behind  it.  The  focus  pulling  BTI  behind  the  FÖRNUFT  display  pulled   shoppers  attention  and  therefore  their  patronage  intention  away  from  another  seemingly   important  product  on  the  retail  floor.     Additionally,  the  FÖRNUFT  display  is  the  only  freestanding  display  structure  that  is   selling  utensils,  in  the  "Cookshop  and  Tableware"  department.  In  contrast,  both  the   FÄRGRIK  and  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display,  in  addition  to  other  freestanding  displays,  sold

dishware.    Being  the  only  freestanding  flatware  display  in  IKEA  North  York's  Market  Hall   should  be  a  good  thing  as  the  display  is  seemingly  more  prominent  to  shoppers  who  are   just  casually  browsing  through  the  store.  However,  for  shoppers  who  like  to  comparison   shop  in  the  retail  environment  and  evaluate  different  products,  the  FÖRNUFT  display  is   located  too  far  away  from  similar  products  that  are  located  on  nearby  wall  display,  which   prevents  shoppers  from  making  quick  comparisons.  With  the  table  shelf  and  sample   products  that  are  so  hard  to  distinguish  from  the  overall  FÖRNUFT  display,  it  is  also  very   difficult  for  shoppers  to  take  a  sample  product  away  from  the  display  for  comparison   purposes.  As  such,  while  the  placement  of  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  is  beneficial  in   some  regard,  it  hinders  shoppers'  ability  to  browse  the  store  with  ease.   The  location  and  retail  context  of  the  FÖRNUFT  product  display  have  both  positive   and  negative  repercussions.  The  display  is  located  close  to  the  aisle,  yet  is  inaccessible  from   multiple  angles.  Additionally,  despite  the  freestanding  nature  of  the  FÖRNUFT  display,  it  is   placed  beside  a  highly  designed  competitive  display  and  is  not  in  close  proximity  to  similar   products.  Despite  their  best  intentions,  IKEA  North  York's  inconsistent  use  of  design   strategies  results  in  the  lack  of  focus  in  the  visual  elements  of  the  FÖRNUFT  display.  As   such,  while  small  segments  of  the  FÄRGRIK  product  display  were  strategically  designed   and  effective  forms  of  visual  communication,  its  overall  visual  message  appeared  to   dissuade  the  viewing  public  from  responding  to  this  example  of  visual  communication   through  consumption.

o o o The  scale  of  the  table  shelf  and  signage  is  too  small  for  the  display   structure  as  a  whole  and,  therefore,  both  elements  disappear.   The  weight  of  the  display  structure  is  unbalanced  due  to  the  large  amount   of  white  packages  on  the  display  base.   The  proximity  is  too  great  between  the  visual  elements  in  the  display,   such  as  the  signage  and  the  display  base,  which  detracts  from  the  display's   message.

o o A  focus  pulling  BTI  behind  the  FÖRNUFT  display  pulled  shoppers   attention  away  from  the  display.     The  display  is  located  too  far  away  from  similar  products  hindering   shoppers'  ability  to  browse  the  store  with  ease

c. LUGN/ÖPPEN i. Signage (2D) Figure  17:  Sign  at  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display      There  is  a  single  sign  above  the   LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  (see  Figure   17).  In  spite  of  this,  the  sign  does  not   clearly  state  what  items  are  being  sold  in   the  product  display  below.  Currently,  the   signage  above  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product   display  only  promotes  LUGN  products;  yet,   ÖPPEN  products  are  sold  on  the  same   display  structure  and  both  products  have   the  same  price.  Therefore,  it  appears  as  if   customers  regard  the  sign  as  applicable  to   both  products  when,  in  fact,  it  refers  to  only   one.  Upon  initial  impression,  the  sign  could   be  made  clearer,  indicating  that  the  display   is  selling  two  different  product  lines  for  the   same  price.  Although  the  sign  includes   information  on  LUGN's  product  name,   product  type,  and  price,  there  is  an  element  

  

59  

of  miscommunication  that  causes  confusion  in  the  message  delivery.  The  use  of  yellow  and   orange  in  the  sign  directs  attention  to  the  extremely  low  cost  product.  Additionally,  both   white  space  and  hierarchical  elements  prioritize  important  pieces  of  information  on  the   sign.        Figure  18:  LUGN/ÖPPEN  signage  price  tag  graphic      The  only  use  of  colour  in  the   LUGN/ÖPPEN  sign,  other  than  black   and  white,  is  in  the  yellow  and   orange  graphic  beneath  the  price  tag   (refer  to  Figure  18).  The  simple   yellow  and  orange  squares  makes   both  the  graphic,  and  the   overlapping  price  text,  stand  out  due   to  the  high  degree  of  contrast  between  the  bold  colours  and  the  stark  white  background  of   the  sign  (Dondis,  1973).  By  using  colour  in  this  manner,  the  design  of  the  sign  strategically   highlights  a  key  piece  of  information  to  shoppers.  The  Market  Hall  is  generally  void  of   colour,  especially  on  signs,  therefore,  this  simple  graphic  element  makes  this  sign  stand  out   to  shoppers.  Additionally,  the  use  of  warm  colours  has  been  proven  to  draw  customer   attention  in  retail  settings  (Bellizzi,  Crowley,  and  Hasty,  1983),  yet  the  bold  and  saturated   nature  of  the  colours  still  invoke  a  sense  of  urgency  (Bellizzi,  Crowley,  and  Hasty,  1983)   that  corresponds  to  the  low  price  nature  of  the  products  being  sold  on  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN   product  display.  Lastly,  in  comparison  to  the  size  of  the  sign  as  a  whole,  the  yellow  and  

  

60  

orange  graphic  takes  up  a  substantial  amount  of  the  overall  composition  of  the  sign.  As   such,  whatever  information  is  placed  on  the  graphic  is  extremely  prominent  to  shoppers   due  to  the  significant  and  purposeful  use  of  colour.

   Although  the  rest  of  the  sign  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  does  not  include  any   colour,  both  white  space  and  elements  of  information  hierarchy  are  used  to  prioritize  a   certain  piece  of  information  in  the  sign  that  IKEA  North  York  deems  is  most  pertinent  to   shoppers  (refer  to  Figure  19).  The  primary  selling  point  for  both  LUGN  and  ÖPPEN   products  appears  to  be  price.  Therefore,  white  space  is  used  to  visually  emphasize  and   prioritize  the  price  on  the  sign.  White  space  can  be  seen  between  the  first  four  lines  of  text   and  the  large  type  price  tag  as  well  as  between  the  price  tag  and  the  IKEA  logo.  While  the   sign  may  appear  unbalanced,  these  unequal  instances  of  white  space  allow  for  the  reader  to   prioritize  the  price  of  the  product  in  the  overall  composition  of  the  sign  as  the  price  tag  is   isolated  from  all  the  other  visual  elements  on  the  page.  Although,  white  space  emphasizes   the  price  on  the  sign,  it  also  overwhelms  the  top  section  of  the  sign.  Here,  the  four  small   lines  of  black  text  are  overpowered  by  the  surrounding  white  space  and,  as  such,  almost   blend  into  the  rest  of  the  sign.  Again,  white  space  is  used  in  the  sign  to  emphasize  the  price   of  the  product,  which  is  also  done  through  deemphasizing  all  the  other  textual  information   in  the  document.     As  information  hierarchies  organize,  prioritize,  and  communicate  visually  by   modifying  the  visual  weights  different  elements  carry,  scale  is  an  important  indicator  of  the   most  salient  parts  in  a  document.  The  price  tag  on  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  sign  is  extremely  large   in  the  context  of  the  overall  composition  making  it  the  most  prominent  piece  of   information  for  shoppers.  Additionally,  the  "¢"  symbol  next  to  the  price  is  the  same  size  as   the  numbers  themselves.  By  creating  the  unit  of  measure  at  the  same  scale  as  the  price   itself,  IKEA  North  York  clearly  emphasizes  the  low  cost  and  value  of  the  product.  From   looking  at  the  amplified  visual  weight  on  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  sign,  it  is  obvious  that  the  sign      62  

is  meant  to  be  viewed  from  a  distance.  This  explains  the  exaggerated  scale  of  the  yellow   and  orange  graphic,  the  large  price  tag,  and  bigger  than  average  currency  symbol.  The  use   of  scale  to  prioritize  the  price  of  the  product  is  done  in  order  to  draw  shoppers,  who  are   just  entering  the  Market  Hall,  closer  to  the  display.   The  significant  amounts  of  white  space  surrounding  the  price  and  the  exaggerated   use  of  scale  in  the  design  of  this  sign  allows  for  the  information  present  to  become  more   valuable  to  readers.  The  design  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  sign  clearly  places  a   significant  amount  of  importance  on  the  low  cost  nature  of  the  product.  This  is  evident   because  colour,  white  space,  and  elements  of  hierarchy,  especially  scale,  were  all  used  in   combination  with  one  another  to  place  visual  weight  on  the  product  price.   From  my  observations  it  was  clear  that  the  shoppers'  response  to  the  signage  was  to   immediately  look  at  the  products  on  display.  Overall,  the  large  banner  appeared  to  be  very   effective  in  garnering  attention  from  shoppers.  However,  the  signage  at  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN   display  attracted  only  39  shoppers  over  two  days,  which  was  the  lowest  total  number  of   visual  interactions  out  of  all  three  observed  displays.  This  can  be  partially  attributed  to  the   difficulty  of  observing  responses  to  the  signage  from  shoppers  who  had  viewed  the  sign   from  a  distance.  Regardless,  the  visual  elements  in  the  display  structure  managed  to   motivate  seven  shoppers  to  purchase  LUGN  or  ÖPPEN  products,  which  was  the  highest   number  of  total  intended  purchases.  This  demonstrates  that  though  the  sign  was  able  to   attract  many  shoppers'  attention,  it  is  generally  not  meant  to  be  viewed  within  close   proximity.  Additionally,  the  data  demonstrates  that  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  was   the  most  successful  in  garnering  potential  sales,  as  10.45%  of  shoppers  who  interacted   with  the  display  intended  to  purchase  the  product.  The  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  was  the  most  

  

63  

successful  display  in  garnering  sales,  but  it  also  received  the  highest  number  of  tactile   responses  at  21.  As  such,  from  reviewing  the  data,  the  display  signage  was  successful  in   garnering  attention  for  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  from  a  distance  and  the  actual  structure   of  the  display  appears  to  be  the  defining  point  of  visual  persuasion  for  shoppers.     ii.

   The  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  (see  Figures  20  and  21)  does  not  give  off  a  positive  first   visual  impression,  because,  at  the  time  of  observation,  the  display  was  extremely  messy,   disorganized,  and  cluttered,  which  gave  the  feeling  that  this  already  low  cost  product  was   even  "cheaper"  than  it  appeared.  This  disorganized  appearance  could  have  been  a   deterrent  for  shoppers  who  could  not  see  the  product  clearly  amongst  all  the  cardboard   scattered  throughout  the  display  structure.  Furthermore,  this  display  did  not  seem  to   correspond  with  IKEA  North  York's  clean,  minimalist  aesthetic  and  style  sense.   Additionally,  the  untidy  display  structure  cheapens  the  products  being  sold,  which  further   emphasizes  that  LUGN/ÖPPEN  products  are  value  oriented,  rather  than  design  focused.   Despite  its  state  of  disarray,  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  was  extremely  successful  in   attracting  tactile  responses,  as  21  shoppers  interacted  with  the  display  over  a  span  of  two   hours.  Additionally,  due,  in  part,  to  these  tactile  responses,  7  shoppers  intended  to   purchase  items  from  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display.      Colour  is  one  of  the  distinguishing  features  of  a  Breathtaking  Item  (BTI).  In  the  

Market  Hall,  BTIs  are  instantly  recognizable  due  to  the  use  of  colour  on  both  the  retail   signage  and  on  accent  walls.  For  instance,  just  like  with  other  BTIs  in  IKEA  North  York's   Market  Hall,  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  features  a  large  red  pillar  located   immediately  behind  the  display  structure.  Bellizzi,  Crowley,  and  Hasty  (1983)  found  that,  in   retail  environments,  the  colour  red  has  the  ability  to  draw  in  shoppers  and  encourage   impulsive  and  unplanned  purchases,  both  of  these  elements  are  coincidentally   characteristic  of  a  BTI  product  display.  This  use  of  a  strong,  bold  colour  on  a  structural  part   retail  space  makes  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  really  standout  out  in  the  store   environment,  which  consists  of  predominantly  white  walls.  This  holds  especially  true  in  the      65  

Spring/Summer  season  where  green  is  the  featured  accent  colour  in  the  retail  environment   at  IKEA  North  York.  As  green  is  the  complimentary  colour  to  red,  the  colour  contrast  makes   the  pillar  seem  even  more  prominent  in  the  space  (Dondis,  1973).  The  colour  red  also  has   cultural  connotations  in  the  retail  space  as  it  is  often  used  to  denote  "sale"  or  discounted   products.  Thus,  the  use  of  red  is  effective  in  garnering  attention  to  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN   product  display  due  to  its  high  contrast  with  the  rest  of  the  retail  space  and  with  the  colour   green  and  because  the  colour  immediately  resonates  with  shoppers  who  understand  that,   conventionally,  red  in  the  retail  space  denotes  a  value  based  product  for  sale.   Although  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  effectively  uses  the  colour  red  to   promote  the  display  in  the  Market  Hall  and  emphasize  the  low  cost  nature  of  the  product,   the  other  colours  used  in  the  display  are  dull  in  comparison.  For  instance,  there  is  a  lot  of   brown  in  the  product  display  due  to  the  extensive  use  of  cardboard  as  a  means  of  product   display  and  storage.  As  such,  the  overall  feeling  of  the  display  is  monochromatic  and   lackluster,  which  is  not  a  good  visual  impression  to  make  when  trying  to  attract  consumer   attention.  Additionally,  the  use  of  brown  cardboard  adds  to  the  industrial  feel  of  the  Market   Hall.  While  the  Market  Hall  is  essentially  a  warehouse  appearance,  elements  of  design  and   visual  merchandising  strategies  are  used  to  detract  from  the  industrial  feeling  of  the  space.   Nevertheless,  by  using  copious  amounts  of  brown  in  the  design,  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product   display  seems  to  have  a  warehouse  feel.  Regardless,  shoppers  remained  intrigued  by  the   product  display,  so  while  the  use  of  the  colour  brown  may  not  be  visually  appealing  it  is   able  to  persuade  shoppers  the  items  being  sold  on  the  display  are  value  based  and  worthy   of  their  consideration.

Figure  22:  White  space  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  structure     Unlike  many  of  other  product   displays  in  the  Market  Hall  at  IKEA   North  York,  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display   structure  contains  a  substantial  amount   of  white  space  (see  Figure  22),  which,   while  visually  unbalanced,  draws   attention  to  the  display  in  the  store   environment.  There  is  a  significant   amount  of  white  space  above  the   ÖPPEN  items  on  the  right  side  of  the   LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display.  Unlike   the  left  part  of  the  display,  where  the   LUGN  items  are  located,  which  is  visually  supported  by  a  large  red  pillar  and  sign,  the  right   side  of  the  structure  contains  a  large  empty  space.  This  large  white  space  adds  to  the  sense   of  emptiness  and  general  disorganization  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  structure.   Additionally,  the  display  seems  unbalanced  as  the  right  side  of  the  display  is  not  visually   supported  and  fails  to  be  grounded  in  the  space.  As  such,  due  to  the  vast  white  space  in  the   display  structure,  the  right  half  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  essentially  disappears   in  the  store.   As  the  display  seems  to  be  selling  both  LUGN/ÖPPEN  products,  regardless  of  the   misinformation  on  the  signage,  the  design  of  the  display  could  benefit  from  some  content   on  the  right  side  of  the  display.  For  instance,  the  red  pillar  or  the  signage  could  be

expanded  horizontally  to  cover  the  white  space,  which  would  also  draw  more  attention   from  a  distance  to  the  display  as  a  whole.  However,  despite  the  shortfalls  in  the  aesthetics   of  the  display  structure,  shoppers  were  continually  drawn  to  the  product  display  and,  from   my  observations,  to  the  ÖPPEN  side  of  the  display  in  particular.  Therefore,  although  the   design  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  contained  an  unbalanced  amount  of  white   space,  the  consumer  reactions  to  the  display  were  generally  quite  positive.        Figure  23:  Information  hierarchy  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display            Colour  contrast

   Scale  and  contrast  are  both  used  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  to  create  a   succinct  hierarchy  of  the  visual  elements  of  information  (see  Figure  23).  The  display   contained  colour  contrast  as  the  colour  red,  which  was  placed  directly  against  the  white   walls  of  the  Market  Hall  and  the  display  signage,  drew  viewers  to  the  display  structure.  Like   the  use  of  colour,  the  texture  of  the  products  was  used  to  create  contrast  in  the  display   structure  as  the  smooth  plate  and  bowls  on  display  directly  stood  out  against  the  rough   surface  of  the  cardboard  (Dondis,  1973).  This  textural  contrast  could  have  been  the   motivation  for  shoppers  to  have  tactile  responses  to  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display.  In   terms  of  scale,  the  table  shelf,  which  is  meant  to  entice  tactile  interaction,  is   disproportionately  sized  for  the  display  structure.  The  table  shelf  is  way  too  small  for  the   overall  composition  of  the  display  and,  as  such,  discourages  shoppers  from  interacting  with   the  products  on  display.  As  the  remainder  of  the  products,  located  on  the  cardboard   supports,  takes  up  the  majority  of  the  display,  this  is  what  shoppers  interact  with  and  how   the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  structure  achieves  tactile  responses  from  customers.   Although  some  shoppers  clearly  wanted  to  touch  the  products  on  display,  the  display   structure  was  not  very  conducive  to  tactile  responses.  From  my  observations,  I  noticed  that   the  incorrect  products  were  placed  on  the  display  table  shelf.  Though,  the  table  shelf  may   not  be  as  important  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  because  the  products  are  not  located  in   boxes  and  are  therefore  easier  for  shoppers  to  interact  with.  Just  as  the  large  display   attracted  shoppers'  touch  reaction,  the  exaggerated  scale  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display   signage  likewise  attracted  the  attention  of  shoppers'  eyes.  Unlike  the  other  signs  in  the   Market  Hall,  the  sign  for  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  is  very  large.  As  previously  

  

69  

mentioned,  this  allows  for  shoppers  to  notice  the  display  from  a  distance,  but  also  distracts   shoppers  from  the  display's  lack  of  design  focus  and  industrial  feel.   Although  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  is  meant  to  sell  products  for  impulse  purchases,   during  my  period  of  observation,  shoppers  spent  most  of  time  deciding  on  whether  or  not   to  but  the  items.  This  could  be  due  to  the  untidy  nature  of  the  display,  which  lacked  clarity   and  focus  that  essentially  hinders  shoppers  from  making  a  quick  decision.  The  messiness  of   the  display  requires  a  longer  period  of  contemplation  because  the  visual  information  in  the   display  is  not  designed  in  a  coherent  manner.  The  display  was  very  confusing  and  difficult   to  navigate,  larger  signs  and  clearer  indicators  are  needed  to  clarify  and  differentiate   between  what  products  are  being  sold  and  how  much  they  cost.  Alternatively,  more  space   can  be  placed  between  the  two  product  displays  to  separate  them  visually.  However,   regardless  of  the  design  shortfalls  in  the  display  structure,  including  the  overuse  of  the   colour  brown,  the  unbalanced  amount  of  white  space,  and  the  exaggerated  hierarchy  of   information,  the  display  structure  was  successful  in  garnering  tactile  responses  and   potential  sales.   iii. Location and Ambience (3D) The  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  is  a  BTI,  which  means  that  IKEA  North  York  purposefully   placed  in  a  hot  spot  in  the  Market  Hall  and  considers  it  to  be  a  high-priority  item.  However,   the  ambience  of  the  display  does  not  correspond  with  the  display's  role  as  a  Breathtaking   Item  because,  while  the  display  is  meant  to  be  seen  from  a  distance,  the  view  of  the   LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  is  obscured  and  the  location  of  it  is  somewhat  hidden.

   The  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  is  the  first  major  display  shoppers  see  upon   entering  the  Market  Hall  from  the  Showroom  (refer  to  Figure  24).  The  display  stands  out   to  shoppers  because  of  the  use  of  colour,  which  extends  from  the  floor  to  the  ceiling  and   makes  the  display  very  noticeable  from  a  distance.  But,  it  is  only  the  sign,  not  the  display   structure  or  the  products,  that  is  apparent  to  shoppers  from  a  distance.  The  display  could   benefit  from  making  the  products  more  prominent  as  it  is  not  immediately  clear  what  the   display  is  selling  only  that  the  items,  whatever  they  may  be,  are  inexpensive.  There  is  a   single  pot  light  pointed  directly  at  the  sign  in  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display.  The  sign  is  the

most  prominent  feature  of  the  display  and  therefore  it  makes  sense  that  the  only  lighting   element  focused  on  the  display  structure  is  pointing  towards  the  signage.     One  of  the  reasons  that  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  is  obscured  from   shoppers'  view  is  its  location  in  the  Market  Hall.  Figure  6  contains  a  map  of  IKEA  North   York's  Market  Hall.  The  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  is  somewhat  hidden  behind  a   display  of  "Now  or  Never"  sale  items,  which  is  in  the  aisle  of  the  Market  Hall.  This  display   contains  a  random  selection  of  brightly  colored  soon  to  be  discontinued  products  that  are   offered  at  a  low  cost.  Almost  everyone  that  approaches  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display   touches  the  products,  but  not  that  many  shoppers  come  close  to  the  display.  This  may  be   due,  in  part,  to  the  display's  hidden  location,  which  does  not  allow  for  shoppers  to  see  the   items  being  sold  from  a  distance.  A  lot  of  shoppers  during  my  period  of  observation   interacted  with  and  purchased  products  from  the  "Now  or  Never"  display,  but  did  not  even   notice  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  display  right  beside  it.  Much  like  how  the  table  display  beside  the   FÄRGRIK  product  display  detracted  attention  away  from  the  FÄRGRIK  display,  the  location   and  proximately  of  the  "Now  or  Never"  display  is  forcing  attention  away  from  what  IKEA   North  York  identifies  as  a  BTI.  While,  from  a  distance,  the  signage  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN   product  display  attracts  consumer  attention,  the  location  of  a  competitive  display  both   obscures  and  detracts  from  this  BTI  from  shoppers  within  the  vicinity  of  the  display.   The  LUGN/ÖPPEN  product  display  could  benefit  from  being  placed  closer  to  the   aisle,  so  that  shoppers  who  are  walking  along  the  "Long  Natural  Way"  will  automatically  be   forced  to  interact  with  the  display.  However,  considering  the  state  of  disarray  that  the   display  seems  to  be  in,  perhaps  IKEA  North  York  thinks  that  it  is  beneficial  to  have  such  a   messy  display  is  the  background  of  the  Market  Hall.  Regardless,  while  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN  

  

72  

product  display  was  the  most  successful  display,  in  terms  of  overall  tactile  responses  and   intended  purchases,  the  display  could  be  even  more  productive  with  a  few  simple  design   changes.  At  the  moment,  despite  IKEA  North  York's  identification  of  the  LUGN/ÖPPEN   product  display  as  a  BTI,  the  store  appears  to  be  hiding  the  display  and  downplaying  its   value  in  the  Market  Hall  thus  preventing  consumer-driven  desires.

o o The  exaggerated  use  of  scale  in  the  sign,  including  the  increased  visual   weight  of  the  ¢  symbol,  prioritize  the  product's  low  price.   Colour  contrast  in  the  sign  adds  visual  interest  and  makes  the  overlaying   price  tag  stand  out.

9. Discussion
From  my  analysis  of  the  visual  communication  strategies  utilized  in  the  product   displays  at  IKEA  North  York  it  is  clear  that  this  store  strategically  uses  elements  of  design,   including  colour,  information  hierarchy,  and  white  space,  to  persuade  its  shoppers  to  make   purchases  purely  through  the  visual  components  of  their  product  displays.  In  particular,   both  white  space  and  information  hierarchy  were  successfully  used  throughout  both  the   display  signage  and  structure  to  emphasize  and  prioritize  specific  pieces  of  information   that  IKEA  North  York  deemed  important  to  shoppers.  In  multiple  instances,  IKEA  North   York  chose  to  place  a  high  degree  of  importance  on  value-based  products  by  increasing  the   size  of  price  tags  and  surrounding  the  type  with  white  space.  Additionally,  colour  was  often   used  to  accent  elements  in  the  retail  signage,  including  price.  It  is  clear  that  the  two   displays  that  contained  colour  were  the  most  successful  in  garnering  both  tactile  responses   and  sales,  therefore,  it  appears  as  though  colour  plays  an  important  role  in  the  retail   environment  especially  on  the  traditional  two-dimensional  plane.   In  general,  the  product  displays'  visual  elements  in  the  "Cookshop  and  Tableware"   department  at  IKEA  North  York  were  somewhat  effective  in  garnering  sales  from  shoppers   due  their  overreliance  on  garnering  visual  attention,  rather  than  tactile  responses.  For  the   most  part,  each  of  the  signs  for  the  three  observed  product  displays  were  well  designed  and   effectively  communicated  a  succinct  message  to  shoppers.  However,  each  of  the  three   displays  had  major  shortfalls  in  regards  to  creating  display  structures  that  effectively   presented  products  for  shoppers  to  interact  with.  While  all  three  displays  contained  a  table   shelf  with  sample  products,  these  shelves  often  contained  incorrect  product  samples,  were  

  

75  

too  small  for  the  overall  composition  of  the  display,  or  simply  blended  into  the  display   structure.  Additionally,  two  of  the  three  displays,  FÄRGRIK    and  FÖRNUFT,  sold  products   contained  within  product  packaging,  which  further  hindered  shoppers'  ability  to  touch  the   products  being  sold.   Touch  sensation  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  retail  experience  for  shoppers  and  an   effective  strategy  for  making  the  retail  environment  more  effective  in  garnering  sales.   Especially  when  shopping  for  household  goods,  the  ability  to  touch  products  is  crucial  to   consumers  as  "we  live  in  a  tactile-deprived  society,  and  shopping  is  one  of  our  few  chances   to  freely  experience  the  material  world  firsthand.  Almost  all  unplanned  buying  is  the  result   of  touching...  something  on  the  premises  of  a  store"  (Underhill,  1999,  p.  158).     Underhill  (1999)  refers  to  tactile  interaction  as  "petting"  and  it  can  be  done  for   obvious,  physical  reasons  such  as  testing  the  quality  of  products;  but,  touching  is  also  part   of  the  shopping  experience  as  it  involves  the  consumer  with  the  product  firsthand  and   makes  the  item  seem  more  attainable  to  them.  Therefore,  shoppers  who  have  the  ability  to   touch  products  of  interest  are  more  likely  to  purchase  them  due  to  their  positive  sensory   experience.  Due  to  the  importance  of  petting  in  the  retail  environment,  IKEA  North  York   would  benefit  from  designing  their  displays  to  further  encourage  tactile  responses.  While   the  table  shelves  in  the  display  are  a  positive  start,  elements  of  design,  such  as  scale,   contrast,  and  colour,  could  be  used  to  emphasize  these  shelves  in  the  overall  composition  of   the  display  structure.     Just  as  IKEA  North  York  could  emphasize  tactile  responses  in  their  product  displays,   some  other  visual  communication  changes  can  be  made  to  make  the  Market  Hall  at  IKEA   North  York's  retail  space  more  conducive  to  consumer's  behaviours  and  shopping  habits.

At  the  moment,  IKEA  North  York  successfully  designs  their  retails  space  from  a  micro   perspective,  that  is,  the  individual  parts  of  their  retail  displays,  such  as  signage,  are   generally  quite  effective  forms  of  visual  communication  as  they  persuade  shoppers  to   notice  the  product  display.  However,  the  display  structure  itself  as  well  as  the  placement  of   the  displays  in  the  Market  Hall  seems  to  show  an  incomplete  understanding  of  design  on  a   three-dimensional  plane.  Kent  (2003)  states  that,  as  part  of  the  evolution  of  the  retail   brand,  design  "has  moved  beyond  two-dimensional,  visual  expressions  of  format  and   product  identity  to  embrace  three-dimensional  space  of  the  store  environment"  (p.  131).   Design,  Kent  (2003)  elaborates,  "has  evolved  from  a  graphical,  2D  approach  in  the  creation   of  an  identity,  to  the  combined  concept  of  external  architecture  and  internal  spaces"  (p.   140).  Designing  a  retail  space  or  store  environment  requires  that  the  product  display  be   visually  persuasive  as  a  whole,  not  just  in  parts.  In  particular,  IKEA  North  York  needs  to   focus  on  the  hierarchy  of  information  in  their  retail  space  and  prioritize  information  that  is   being  presented  to  the  shopping  public.  As  well,  ambient  qualities  and  elements  of   atmospherics  must  be  taken  into  consideration,  as  these  product  displays  do  not  exist  in   isolation,  rather  they  have  to  work  in  the  space  as  a  whole.     Additional  suggestions  for  improvement  include  avoiding  overcrowding  the  Market   Hall  in  order  to  allow  the  product  displays  on  the  floor  ample  room  to  attract  shoppers'   attention.  As  well,  attention  must  be  paid  to  neighboring  displays.  Often  successful  displays   are  ignored  when  placed  next  to  a  flashier,  more  heavily  designed  display  structures.   Lastly,  IKEA  North  York  should  keep  in  mind  that  although  shoppers  should  be  browsing   the  store  along  the  "Long  Natural  Way"  often  customers  veer  off  this  path  and  miss  displays   that  are  only  designed  to  be  viewed  from  a  single,  frontal  angle.    

  

77  

As  well,  while  many  display  structures  were  effective  to  a  degree,  they  suffered  from   a  general  lack  of  maintenance  and  upkeep.  Both  the  FÖRNUFT  and  LUGN/ÖPPEN  displays   contained  disorganized  or  messy  stock,  which  left  a  poor  visual  impression  on  shoppers   and,  more  importantly,  failed  to  correspond  with  IKEA  North  York's  clean  and  modern   brand.  Despite  the  fact  that  many  retailers  feel  that  customers  do  not  buy  from  empty  or   near  empty  displays  (Razzouk,  N.  Y.,  Seitz,  V.,  &  Kumar,  V.,  2001),  which  often  resulting  in   the  daily  restocking  and  completion  of  displays,  "incomplete  product  displays  can  lead   other  shoppers  to  make  positive  assumptions  about  missing  items  and  therefore  purchase   the  same  items"  (Kopec,  2006,  p.277).  Research  shows  that  by  maintaining  incomplete   product  displays,  especially  for  new  and  slow-moving  items,  retailers  can  actually   encourage  customers  to  make  purchases  (Razzouk,  N.  Y.,  Seitz,  V.,  &  Kumar,  V.,  2001).   While  IKEA  North  York  probably  does  not  purposefully  have  half  empty  or  obviously   tampered  displays  in  the  Market  Hall,  despite  the  negative  visual  impression,  doing  so   might  actually  encourage  consumer  behaviour.  True  to  this  statement,  both  he  FÖRNUFT   and  LUGN/ÖPPEN  displays  resulted  in  the  highest  number  of  intended  purchases,  while  the   tidiest  display,  FÄRGRIK,  received  none.   Despite  the  successful  analysis  and  interpretation  of  the  visual  information  collected   from  IKEA  North  York,  and  its  connection  to  the  corresponding  consumer  behaviour,  the   results  garnered  from  this  study  cannot  accurately  be  used  to  explain  the  persuasive   communication  latent  in  the  product  displays  at  IKEA  North  York  due  to  the  scale  of  this   research  project.  As  such,  this  study  could  have  benefited  from  a  broader  data  set  including   an  examination  of  multiple  IKEA  Canada  locations,  the  evaluation  of  product  displays  from   different  departments  in  the  Market  Hall,  as  well  as  the  inclusion  of  a  greater  amount  of  

  

78  

product  displays.  Additionally,  the  results  of  the  study  could  be  more  conclusive  given  a   greater  period  of  observation  as  well  as  longer  observation  segments  by  multiple   researchers.  As  well,  unlike  similar  research  in  the  field  of  retail  design  and  visual   merchandising,  this  study  did  not  consider  shopper's  personal  opinions  and  firsthand   experiences  regarding  the  design  of  the  store  environment.  Rather  than  focus  on  shoppers'   reactions  and  personal  motivations  in  regards  to  their  intention  to  purchase  products,  this   study  relied  solely  on  observational  data,  which  could  potentially  be  biased  in  favour  of  the   researcher.  Lastly,  what  is  deemed  "effective"  visual  communication  is  subjective  to  the   viewer,  and,  therefore,  alternative  perspectives  on  the  design  success  of  each  of  the  product   displays  may  be  held  by  readers.  However,  in  following  concepts  derived  from  document   design  and  visual  communication  theory,  it  is  clear  why  and  how  the  conclusions  for  each   of  the  product  display  analyses  were  reached.  Regardless  of  these  methodological   shortcomings,  which  are  excusable  given  the  scale  of  this  study,  the  overarching  conclusion   from  the  research  remains  valid.    

10. Conclusion
Through  observing  consumer  behaviour,  photo  documenting  product  displays,  and   mapping  the  retail  space  in  the  "Cookshop  &  Tableware"  department  in  the  Market  Hall  at   IKEA  North  York,  I  was  able  to  collect  visual  documents  of  three  product  displays  and   monitor  the  surrounding  consumer  behaviour.  Then,  by  applying  concepts  from  document   design  and  visual  communication,  including  colour,  information  hierarchy,  white  space,   and  ambience,  to  each  of  the  product  displays  through  a  thorough  visual  analysis  I  was  able   to  deconstruct  the  communication  and  persuasive  qualities  latent  behind  each  of  the   display's  signs,  display  structures,  and  locations  and  ambient  surroundings.  Through  my  

  

79  

analysis  I  was  able  to  conclude  that  while  IKEA  North  York  is  an  organization  that   constructs  effective  visual  messages  in  their  retail  environments  through  signage  and   traditional  two-dimensional  documents,  while  messages  that  sought  to  attract  shoppers'   attention  on  a  three-dimensional  plane  were  less  successful  in  creating  consumer-driven   desires. My  research  successfully  analyzed  and  discussed  how  IKEA  North  York  persuasively   communicates  to  its  shoppers  through  visuals  in  their  product  displays  for  the  purpose  of   encouraging  shopping  behaviour  and  impacting  purchasing  decisions.  Through  my  MRP,  I   was  able  to  contribute  to  the  definition  of  "communication"  to  include  forms  of  persuasion   and  messaging  that  are  more  subtle  and  exist  in  retail  spaces  and  store  environments;   more  specifically,  it  is  clear  that  visual  design,  to  a  certain  extent,  is  able  to  drive  consumer   behaviour.
