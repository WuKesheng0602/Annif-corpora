Abstract  

      This  master's  research  project  will  analyze  the  rhetorical  persuasive  appeals  found   in  a  YouTube  video  released  by  Australian  community  advocacy  group  Get  Up!,  in   support  of  marriage  equality  in  Australia.  The  video,  entitled  It's  Time,  was  released   in  November  2011  and  has  since  been  viewed  nearly  8  million  times.  This  paper  will   identify  what  persuasive  appeals  are  present  in  the  video  that  may  have  contributed   to  its  virality.  This  paper  will  also  analyze  the  public  YouTube  comments  to  identify   what  persuasive  appeals  are  evident  in  comments  to  either  support  or  oppose  the   video's  cause,  and  comments  will  serve  as  a  measure  of  the  video's  success  in   driving  support  for  marriage  equality.  Ultimately  this  paper  aims  to  understand   what  makes  a  successful  viral  cause-related  video,  and  if  the  video  in  question  was   successful  in  encouraging  active  participation  in  the  cause  amongst  those  who   commented  on  the  video.  Active  participation  of  users  will  be  determined  through   the  primary  measure  of  the  video's  success  足  comments.

Introduction  

      For  decades,  video  has  been  used  as  a  tool  to  promote  and  support  a  variety  of   causes.  Video  has  been  used  to  promote  the  charitable  efforts  of  not-for-profit   organizations,  to  disseminate  the  political  agendas  and  aid  in  wartime  propaganda,   and  became  a  quintessential  part  of  music  history  with  the  introduction  of  the  music   video  to  accompany  song.  2005  was  a  year  that  saw  the  introduction  of  the  most   significant  recent  change  to  the  history  of  video  足  YouTube.    YouTube  has  changed   the  way  charitable  organizations  and  social  causes  function.  Increasingly  we  are   seeing  the  use  of  YouTube  to  promote  social  causes.  YouTube  allows  the   organizations  or  sponsors  of  such  causes  to  promote  and  increase  the  visibility  of   the  cause,  but  also  allows  for  engagement  and  feedback  through  user  comments,   sharing  with  other  social  networks,  and  "liking"  or  "disliking"  the  video  by  clicking   the  "thumbs  up"  or  "thumbs  down"  buttons.  However,  for  the  most  part,  charitable   organizations  or  sponsors  of  social  causes  typically  post  promotional  videos  on   YouTube  to  garner  support  and  buy-in  from  the  general  public.  This  persuasive   function  is  particularly  true  of  cause-related  YouTube  videos  for  controversial  social   issues.          

Legalization  of  gay  marriage  足  or  marriage  equality  足  is  one  such  controversial  social   issue  that  has  graced  the  covers  of  newspapers,  has  remained  in  the  headlines,  and   that  has  been  hotly  debated  online  in  recent  years.  Australia  is  one  of  the  few  "First   World"  democratic  countries  that  has  yet  to  pass  legislation  for  marriage  equality,      6  

the  topic  of  marriage  equality  remaining  a  national  debate.  In  November  2011,   Australian  social  advocacy  group  Get  Up!  released  the  YouTube  video  It's  Time  in   support  of  marriage  equality.  The  video  caught  the  attention  of  mainstream  press   and  quickly  went  viral,  being  shared  throughout  social  networking  sites.        This  research  paper  will  use  It's  Time  as  a  case  study,  which  is  being  examined  for  its   persuasive  appeals  and  the  measurable  success  of  the  video.  For  the  purposes  of  this   research  paper,  the  primary  measure  of  its  success  will  be  the  video  comments.     There  are  two  key  areas  of  research  that  this  paper  will  explore.  Firstly,  it  will   examine  the  persuasive  power  of  It's  Time  through  an  analysis  of  the  rhetorical   persuasive  appeals  utilized.  Secondly  it  will  assess  the  virality  and  success  of  the   video,  as  demonstrated  through  the  video  views  and  comments.  Through  an  analysis   of  a  limited  data  set  of  viewer  comments,  this  paper  will  shed  some  light  on  the   video's  success  in  persuading  audiences  to  support  marriage  equality.  The  video's   success  will  be  assessed  through  the  limited  comments  that  have  been  analyzed  for   the  scope  of  this  research  project.

Research  Questions  

      My  research  is  interested  in  what  makes  a  video  go  viral.  Through  my  literature   review  I  aimed  to  establish  what  viral  or  virality  means,  what  the  basic   characteristics  and  benefits  of  a  viral  videos  are,  and  gain  some  insight  as  to  what   might  contribute  to  a  video  going  viral.  To  support  my  research  I  have  two  research   questions  that  help  analyze  It's  Time:   RQ1:  How  are  persuasive  appeals  used  in  the  YouTube  video  It's  Time?   RQ2:  What  do  the  sample  viewer  comments  suggest  in  terms  of  the  video's  success   in  persuading  audiences  to  support  marriage  equality?

Theoretical  Context  

      This  study  focuses  on  the  persuasive  appeals  in  a  cause-related  YouTube  video.   Therefore,  my  study  will  be  grounded  in  classical  rhetoric  and  Aristotle's  notions  of   Ethos,  Pathos,  and  Logos.        The  term  rhetoric  has  been  defined  differently  among  scholars,  to  suit  the  purpose   of  their  respective  research.  Historically,  the  term  is  derived  from  the  Greek   rhtorik坦s,  `the  art  of  speaking'  or  using  language  to  persuade  and  influence   (Richards,  2008).  According  to  Lester  C.  Olson,  Cara  A.  Finnegan,  and  Diane  S.  Hope,   rhetoric  "seeks  and  creates  public  audiences  through  symbolic  identifications   situated  in  specific  historical  times,  places,  and  contexts"  (Olson  et  al.,  2008).   Rhetoric  as  a  theory  can  be  traced  back  to  Ancient  Greece,  where  early  thinkers   Plato  and  Aristotle  set  the  framework  for  the  study  of  rhetoric,  a  framework  that  is   still  widely  cited  and  respected  today.  Plato  first  explores  rhetoric  in  his  famous   work  Gorgias,  attacking  demagogic  speakers  for  using  pleasure  to  manipulate  their   audiences  (Olmsted,  2006),  and  contrasts  truth-seeking  philosophers  with  the   `sophist',  a  teacher  of  mere  rhetoric  (Richards,  2008).  Aristotle  passionately   responded  to  Gorgias  in  his  work  Rhetoric,  rejecting  earlier  emphasis  on  emotion   and  making  argument  the  central  issue  of  rhetoric  (Olmsted,  2006).  Aristotle's   Rhetoric  outlines  strategies  of  rhetorical  persuasion  and  specific  terms  for  readers   to  use  to  inform  their  own  interpretations  of  arguments  (Olmsted,  2006).  Ethos,

Pathos  and  Logos,  also  known  as  the  rhetorical  triangle,  are  the  three  strategies  or   modes  of  persuasion  that  Aristotle  first  coined.        Ethos  is  focused  on  the  power  of  credibility.  For  instance,  the  persuasive  power  of   ethos  lies  in  its  establishment  of  the  persuader's  good  character  and  credibility   (Rife,  2010).  Further  elements  of  ethos  include  "good  character,  personal  qualities,   connotations,  and  affective  influence"  (Rife,  2010).  Persuasive  appeals  to  ethos  are   commonly  found  in  advertising  for  healthcare  products,  companies  that  aim  to   market  their  products  as  reliable,  trusted,  and  physician  recommended.    Pathos  is   the  mode  of  persuasion  most  concerned  with  emotion.  Persuasive  appeals  to  pathos   aim  to  drive  an  emotional  response  from  audiences,  by  establishing  the  appropriate   mood  and  playing  on  the  audiences'  feelings  (Rife,  2010).  Persuasive  appeals  to   pathos  are  commonly  found  in  advertising  for  social  causes  and  charities,  such  as   advertisements  that  feature  social  minorities  such  as  the  homeless,  abused  women   or  children,  and  the  elderly.  Ethos  and  Pathos  often  work  together  to  create  a   stronger  persuasive  appeal.  Martine  Courant  Rife  (2010)  notes,    "...ethos  first   secures  the  audience's  sympathy  through  the  speaker's  credibility,  verifying  the   speakers  conviction.  Once  the  audience  feels  secure,  this  sense  of  security  is  played   upon  by  the  emotional  appeal,  efficiently  increasing  the  level  of  persuasion"  (Rife,   2010).      Logos  is  focused  on  logic,  reasoning,  or  the  rational  argument  (Rife,  2010).  Logical   appeals  to  logos  are  commonly  found  in  health  and  safety  advertisements,  such  as

smoking  cessation,  impaired  driving,  or  car  advertisements,  each  which  emphasize   safety.  In  many  cases  appeals  to  Logos  overlap  with  appeals  to  Pathos.     Given  that  this  paper  is  focused  on  the  rhetorical  appeals  in  a  short  video  clip,  I  will   also  reference  notions  of  visual  rhetoric  to  provide  additional  theoretical  support  to   my  research.  Visual  rhetoric  can  be  defined  as  the  "symbolic  actions  enacted   primarily  through  visual  means,  made  meaningful  through  culturally  derived  ways   of  looking  and  seeing  and  endeavoring  to  influence  diverse  publics"  (Olson  et  al.,   2008).        The  use  of  visual  rhetoric  became  particularly  prevelant  in  the  19th  and  20th  century,   as  the  world  saw  the  development  of  mediated  image  culture.  This  included  the  rise   of  static  media  (posters,  photographs)  and  moving  media  (film,  television  and  digital   media).  The  cultural  impact  of  these  images,  and  the  public's  insatiable  hunger  for   them,  has  led  to  the  time  period  being  dubbed  ocularcentric  足  or  eye  centred   (Gronbeck,  2008).      It  is  important  to  note  the  power  that  images  hold.  For  example,  images  of  the  time   held  significant  power  to  influence  political  and  social  life  and  impact  ethical  and   moral  judgments  (Gronbeck,  2008).  In  the  early  20th  century  posters  took  centre   stage  as  the  primary  effective  means  of  political  communication,  reaching  their  apex   as  a  political  tool  in  World  War  I  (Gronbeck,  2008).  Posters  were  used  to  influence,   serving  as  a  call  to  action  for  citizens  to  support  a  cause,  and  in  some  cases  even   worked  to  achieve  major  political  reforms  and  revolutions  (Gronbeck,  2008).  

  

11  

Photographs  and  film  also  held  great  power  to  influence.  For  instance,  Gronbeck   notes,  "the  realism  of  photos,  in  comnination  with  eyewitness  journalism,  created  a   potent  rhetorical  combination"  (Gronbeck,  2008).  Conversely,  film  was  used  to   create  some  of  the  most  influential  vehicles  of  political  indoctrination,  such  as   several  infamous  WWII  propaganda  films.        Moreover,  images  play  a  significant  role  in  knowledge  production.  There  is  a   longstanding  historical  association  between  sight  or  visuals  and  knowledge.  This   association  can  be  traced  back  to  key  words  in  ancient  Greek  and  Latin.  For  instance,   the  Greek  words  theoria  (knowledge)  and  theoros  (witness)  are  rooted  in  sight,   while  the  Latin  word  imago  comes  from  the  infinitive  "to  see"  (Gronbeck,  2008).

Literature  Review  
   Scholars  who  have  studied  virality  have  focused  on  a  number  of  different  features,   including  viral  videos  and  their  characteristics,  benefits  of  viral  videos,  and  trends  in   the  causes  of  video  virality.       

The  Phenomenon  of  Video  Virality  
      In  the  late  twentieth  century  video  content  was  controlled  and  distributed  by  large   commercial  broadcast  networks,  with  three  major  networks,  ABC,  CBS,  and  NBC,   essentially  controlling  the  media  landscape.  These  organizations  determined  what   television  content  was  broadcast,  and  thereby  shaped  what  became  popular.   However,  the  power  to  determine  popularity  has  become  democratized,  with  the   rise  of  social  networking  sites  (SNS)  and  user-generated  content  on  popular   platforms  like  Facebook,  Twitter,  YouTube,  and  Buzzfeed  (Broxton  et  al.  2011).    SNS   played  a  significant  role  in  the  rise  of  short  online  videos,  videos  that  lack  both  the   quality  and  format  for  traditional  broadcasting.  Broxton  et  al.  (2011)  note  that   people  have  come  to  rely  on  SNS  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter  to  view  this  video   content,  partly  because  of  the  overwhelming  quantity  of  videos  on  sites  like   YouTube,  and  because  of  an  inherent  desire  for  recommended  content.  Such  videos,   that  become  popular  through  online  sharing  have  come  to  be  termed  viral  videos.   The  term  viral  itself  can  be  etymologically  linked  to  the  word  "virus".  For  example,   Shifman  (2011)  compares  "viral"  to  "virus",  noting  that  such  videos  are  "tagged  as

viral  since  they  spread  rapidly  from  person  to  person  like  an  epidemic."  Shifman   (2011)  draws  on  observations  made  by  Burgess  (2008)  and  Knobel  and  Lankshear   (2007),  defining  a  viral  video  as  "a  clip  that  spreads  to  the  masses  via  digital  word- of-mouth  mechanisms".        However,  the  term  "viral"  is  not  limited  to  its  use  to  describe  highly  shared  videos;  it   is  becoming  increasingly  relevant  in  marketing  and  advertising.  In  Viral  Advertising:   Definitional  Review  and  Synthesis,  Maria  Petrescu  and  Pradeep  Korgaonkar  provide   an  overview  of  the  prominent  academic  terminology  involving  virality,  including   terms  such  as  electronic  word-of-mouth,  word-of  mouse,  viral  marketing,  and  buzz.   Describing  the  history  of  the  term  viral  marketing,  Petrescu  et  al.  (2011)  cite  the   early  work  by  Jurvetson  and  Draper  (1997),  who  are  considered  to  have  first  coined   the  term.  They  used  the  term  to  describe  a  promotional  email  for  Hotmail's  free   email  service,  which  was  included  at  the  bottom  of  every  email  sent  from  the  server.   They  argued  that  the  term  led  to  a  viral  attraction  of  new  users  (Petrescu  et  al.   2011).  More  recent  literature,  such  as  work  by  Akar  and  Topcu  (2011),  tends  to   describe  viral  marketing  as  the  use  of  different  tools  including  blogs,  SNS,  and  user- generated  content  to  help  disseminate  information  at  a  rapid  pace.       

Characteristics  and  Benefits  of  Viral  Videos  
      Scholars  have  identified  a  variety  of  characteristics  to  indicate  a  video's  virality.  One   such  characteristic  is  the  rapid  pace  of  dissemination.  Videos  that  go  viral  on  SNS      14  

typically  do  so  quickly  足  amassing  massive  view  counts  in  hours  or  days.  However,   with  so  much  video  content,  and  the  immediacy  of  video  sharing,  the  trending  viral   video  of  the  moment  is  always  changing  (Broxton  et  al.  2011).  For  example,  citing  a   study  on  new  media  versus  old  media  published  in  Journalisms  (2010),  Broxton  et   al.  discuss  the  impermanence  of  viral  video  popularity,  noting  only     
5%  of  the  top  five  stories  on  Twitter  remained  among  the  top  stories  in  the  following  week...   in  the  mainstream  press,  on  the  other  hand,  50%  of  the  top  five  stories  remained  a  top  story   a  week  later.  [Further],  spotting  those  viral  stories  and  trends  early  on  has  value,  both  in   conferring  status  on  the  people  who  first  shared  them  and  in  providing  monetization   opportunity  for  the  networks  on  which  they  are  shared  (Broxton  et  al.  2011).  

   Broxton  et  al.  describe  two  main  benefits  to  viralness:  opportunity  for  monetization   and  dissemination  of  political  thought  (Broxton  et  al.  2011).  In  terms  of  influencing   social  or  political  thought,  Broxton  et  al.  use  the  example  of  the  2008  US  Presidential   Election,  when  a  combined  900  videos  were  posted  to  YouTube  from  the  Obama  and   McCain  campaigns,  and  American  recording  artist  and  producer  Will.i.am's  "Yes  we   can"  video  went  viral  once  uploaded  to  YouTube  in  February  2008  (Broxton  et  al.   2011).  Presently,  in  2013,  the  video  has  now  been  viewed  nearly  25  million  times,   and  is  an  example  of  the  immense  reach  a  viral  video  can  potentially  have.

Causes  of  Video  Virality:  Trends  
      A  variety  of  scholars  have  explored  the  phenomenon  of  virality  in  the  hope  of   understanding  what  makes  a  video  go  viral.  Cheng  et  al  (2007),  for  instance,  discuss   how  viral  YouTube  videos  differ  from  traditional  media,  emphasizing  video  length,   content,  and  lifespan.  They  highlight  YouTube's  social  networking  functionalities,   which  allow  users  to  literally  `like'  the  videos,  link  them  to  others  and  `favourite'   them,  ultimately  increasing  video  popularity.  Linking  to  other  websites  is  a   significant  factor  in  what  makes  a  video  go  viral.  For  example,  a  study  conducted  by   Cha  et  al.  (2007)  indicated  that  47%  of  all  YouTube  videos  had  incoming  links  from   external  sites,  and  the  combined  views  of  these  linked  videos  accounted  for  90%  of   the  total  views,  thus  suggesting  that  popular  videos  are  more  likely  to  be  linked.  It  is   clear  that  sharability  is  an  important  factor  in  the  success  of  a  viral  video.  However,   Broxton  et  al.  (2011)  argue  that  not  all  highly  shared  videos  generate  a  large   number  of  views  but  do  typically  generate  more  views  over  a  short  period  of  time   than  less  shared  videos.        In  YouTube  and  Social  Movements:  A  Phenomenological  Analysis  of  Participation,   Events  and  Cyberplace,  David  Meek  looks  at  how  Web  2.0,  particularly  YouTube,  is   contributing  to  a  new  form  of  online  social  activism.  Meek  focuses  on  the  not-for- profit  organization  Invisible  Children,  and  their  infamous  Kony  2012  viral  video  as  a   site  for  his  research.  This  article  focuses  on  social  movements  as  they  relate  to   virality.  Meek  outlines  the  key  literature  around  social  movements  and  the  

  

16  

increasing  incorporation  of  technology  to  increase  awareness.  He  asserts  that  the   Internet  allows  for  new  forms  of  participation,  creates  collective  "events",  and   connects  people  to  create  a  network  for  solidarity  and  resistance.  Meek  uses   Wellman's  (2001)  idea  of  cyberplace  to  conceptualize  his  article,  suggesting  that   "place  and  cyberplace  form  a  continuum  upon  which  filmed  events  can  be  located"   (Meek,  2012).    

   Online  Commenting:  Reduced  Social  Cues  
     

A  variety  of  factors  affect  how  individuals  interact  and  communicate  through   mediated  communication  technologies.  For  example,  it  is  important  to  note  the   reduction  in  social  cues  in  these  technologies.  Early  research  into  reduced  social   cues  was  influenced  by  the  introduction  of  the  Social  Presence  Theory  in  1976  by   Short,  Williams,  and  Christie.  These  scholars  focused  on  the  overall  impact  of   different  levels  of  "social  cues"  during  mediated  synchronous  communication.   "Social  cues",  according  to  Martin  Tannis  and  Tom  Postmes  (2003),  are  verbal  or   non-verbal  communication  indicators  that  help  to  individuate  a  person,  and  provide   a  richer  impression  of  that  individual  through  mediated  communication.  The   presence  of  social  cues  in  mediated  communication  is  thought  to  reduce  ambiguity   in  message  reception,  or  decoding  (Tannis  and  Postmes,  2003).  In  their  work  on  the   Social  Presence  Theory,  Short,  Williams,  and  Christie  regarded  social  presence  as   the  degree  of  salience  and  perceived  intimacy  in  the  interaction  (Baym,  2010).  Later   scholars  defined  social  presence  differently.  Baym  (2010)  described  social  presence,      17  

emphasizing  how  interactants  perceive  one  another  and  how  these  perceptions   were  affected  by  nonverbal  cues,  including  facial  expression,  posture,  and  gaze.   These  nonverbal  cues  serve  important  communicative  functions  in  body-to-body   communication  (e.g.  Wieman  and  Napp,  1975).  The  lack  of  these  cues  in  mediated   communication  impacts  clarity  of  message  and  successful  message  reception  and   decoding  (Baym,  2010).    This  is  particularly  relevant  to  communication  platforms   like  YouTube's  comments  section.  For  example,  the  reduction  of  social  cues  in  an   environment  like  YouTube  can  contribute  to  accelerated  and  heightened  emotions,   and  an  increase  in  inter-user  conflicts.  While  some  users  help  to  mitigate  these   conflicts  by  using  emoticons,  capitalization,  and  punctuation  like  exclamation   marks,  comments  can  still  often  be  misinterpreted.        Scholars  who  have  studied  communication  with  cues  filtered  out  note  that  messages   are  harder  to  coordinate,  and  interactants  gain  greater  anonymity  as   communication  is  depersonalized  with  gender,  race,  status  and  other  features  not   immediately  apparent.  These  scholars  have  also  argued  that  mediated  environments   that  lack  social  cues  typically  lack  social  norms  to  guide  behaviour,  resulting  in  an   `anything  goes'  environment  (Baym,  2010).  Additionally,  they  argue  that  these   environments  were  likely  to  encourage  negatively  loaded  emotional  communication   (Baym,  2010).

Online  Commenting:  Anonymity    
      Another  important  factor,  in  addition  to  reduced  social  cues  is  the  anonymity  of   mediated  communication  environments.  Historically,  traditional  feedback  forums   such  as  those  in  journalism  (i.e.  Letters  to  the  Editor)  were  heavily  managed.  Only   selective,  often  edited,  reader  feedback  was  published.  With  the  introduction  of   online  feedback  capabilities  such  as  the  comments  sections  on  blogs,  news  websites,   or  social  media  platforms,  websites  are  becoming  much  less  managed  (Reader,   2012).  Some  online  commenting  forums  are  regulated  collectively  by  commenters   themselves.  For  example,  in  their  study,  Kaigo  and  Watanabe  (2007)  found  that   comments  that  were  categorically  immoral  were  often  denounced  and  opposed  by   other  commenters.  Kaigo  and  Watanabe  described  this  phenomenon  as  one   whereby  "the  user  community  functioned  pro-socially  in  an  uncontrolled,   anonymous  Internet  forum"  (Reader,  2012,  p.  496).    Reader  noted  that  `anonymity'   in  mediated  environments  can  mean  different  things,  "from  the  lack  of  visual   identities  (the  proverbial  name  without  a  face),  to  the  adoption  of  alternate   personae  via  online  pseudonyms  and  avatars,  to  the  expression  of  ideas  without  any   identifying  information  at  all"  (Reader,  2012,  p.  496).  Other  scholars  have  noted  that   the  anonymity  of  online  environments  can  make  people  feel  comfortable  discussing   controversial  issues,  or  making  inappropriate  comments  that  would  not  be  socially   acceptable  in  face-to-face  communication  environments  (Herring  et  al.,  2002).  Some   scholars  have  also  noted  that  the  anonymity  of  online  communication  environments   make  them  attractive  to  minority  individuals  seeking  group  support,  such  as  

  

19  

members  of  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual  and  transgender  (LGBT)  community,  and   members  of  minority  social  or  political  groups  such  as  racial  minorities  and   feminists  (Herring  et  al.,  2002).         

Online  Commenting:  Flaming  and  Trolling  
     

While  the  anonymity  of  online  communication  clearly  has  positive  benefits  for  some   individuals,  many  scholars  have  also  discussed  the  negative  effects,  specifically  two   kinds  of  online  commenting:  flaming  and  trolling.        Flaming  was  defined  by  Walther  et  al.  (1994)  as  hostile  behaviour  between  internet   users  that  includes  messages  with  profanity,  name  calling,  with  intended  negative   effect  (Baym,  2010).  Baym  (2010,  p.  58)  notes  that  "these  messages  occur   predictably  in  online  group  interactions  and  often  lead  to  `flame  wars'  in  which   flames  are  met  with  hostile  retorts.  These  hostilities  escalate,  drawing  in  more   participants."    Joanne  Yates  and  Wanda  J.  Orlikowski  (1992)  describe  a  variety  of   behaviours  that  qualify  as  flaming,  including  emotional  outbursts,  name-calling,   inappropriate  innuendos,  sarcasm,  and  obscene  language.  Some  scholars  attribute   this  frequent  hostility  to  a  lack  of  social  presence,  accountability,  and  the  reduced   social  cues  in  online  communication  environments  (Baym,  2010).  Other  scholars   suggest  that  flaming  occurs  not  because  a  lack  of  norms,  but  because  of  norms.   Individuals  tend  to  mimic  each  other's  behaviour,  whereby  groups  with   argumentative  communication  styles  encourage  this  form  of  communication,  while      20  

more  civil  communication  styles  encourage  more  courteous  behaviour  (Baym,   2010).        While  flaming  involves  intentional  insults  to  provoke  other  users,  trolling  involves   intentionally  drawing  other  users  into  pointless  time-consuming  discussions.    A   common  example  of  an  internet  troll,  for  instance,  would  be  a  user  who  posts  an   intentionally  incorrect  but  not  overtly  controversial  message  with  the  goal  of   drawing  in  na誰ve  or  vulnerable  users  (Herring  et  al.,  2002).       

Rhetoric  in  Persuasive  Videos    
     

Scholars  have  described  the  different  ways  rhetoric  has  been  used  in  persuasive   YouTube  videos.  For  example,  in  YouTube-ification  of  Political  Talk:  An  Examination   of  Persuasion  Appeals  in  Viral  Video,  Kristin  English,  Kaye  D.  Sweetser,  and  Monica   Ancu  focused  on  how  different  rhetorical  persuasive  appeals  are  used  in  political   videos  on  YouTube.  While  Petrescu  and  Korgaonkar  focus  on  defining  viral   marketing  in  their  article,  English  et  al.  look  deeper  at  how  viral  videos  are  used  for   persuasion,  particularly  in  politics.  The  article  emphasizes  the  use  of  ethos,  logos,   and  pathos  in  campaign  videos  from  the  presidential  candidates  of  the  2008  United   States  presidential  election.  The  authors  conducted  a  study  exposing  participants  to   a  variety  of  YouTube  videos  from  the  respective  candidates'  campaigns  that  use   different  rhetorical  appeals.  The  authors  assert  that  the  appeal  that  resonated  the   most  with  viewers  was  ethos.  Ultimately,  ethos  was  both  the  most  credible  and      21  

persuasive  appeal.  Another  scholar,  Scott  H.  Church,  also  acknowledges  the   increasing  significance  of  YouTube  in  the  political  process,  noting  that  it  is  emerging   as  a  credible  outlet  of  political  discourse  (Church,  2010).

Methodology    

      In  this  section  I  will  outline  how  I  conducted  my  research,  particularly  my  analysis   of  my  research  site,  a  YouTube  video  titled  It's  Time.  The  video  was  released  on   November  24  2011  by  Australian  grassroots  community  advocacy  organization,  Get   Up!,  and  quickly  gained  momentum  on  social  networks  and  in  the  press.  As  of  June   2013  the  video  has  amassed  over  8.1  million  views,  received  nearly  100  thousand   likes,  five  thousand  dislikes,  and  almost  fifty  thousand  viewer  comments.  This  data   suggests  the  video  has  a  powerful  attraction,  and  the  comments  specifically  can  be   used  as  a  measure  of  which  particular  aspects  of  the  video  were  most  effective  or   persuasive.    

   About  YouTube  
   Founded  in  2005  by  a  group  of  former  employees  of  the  online  commerce  website   PayPal,  YouTube  aimed  to  enable  the  widespread  easy  sharing  of  video  online   (Burgess  &  Green,  2009).  2005  saw  the  launch  of  a  then  relatively  simple  interface,   with  a  variety  of  technological  affordances  that  allowed  internet  users  to  upload,   publish,  and  view  video  content,  and  link  this  content  to  other  users  through  the  use   of  URLs  足  all  with  relatively  few  technological  constraints  or  built-in  site  limitations   (Burgess  &  Green,  2009).  When  launched,  YouTube  had  few  distinguishing  features   to  set  it  apart  from  other  video  streaming  websites.  However,  with  a  1.6  billion

dollar  acquisition  from  Google  in  2006,  YouTube  began  to  take  the  forefront.  By   2008,  the  site  consistently  ranked  in  the  top  10  most  visited  websites  globally   (Burgess  &  Green,  2009).  One  of  the  sites  co-founders,  Jawed  Karim,  described  four   key  features  that  led  to  YouTube's  success:  "video  recommendations  via  the  `related   videos'  list,  an  email  link  to  enable  video  sharing,  comments  (and  other  social   networking  functionality),  and  an  embeddable  video  player"  (Burgess  &  Green,   2009).        One  of  important  aspects  of  YouTube  as  a  platform  is  its  function  as  a  site  of   participatory  culture.  A  `participatory  culture'  is  defined  as  a  culture  where  "fans   and  other  consumers  are  invited  to  actively  participate  in  the  creation  and   circulation  of  new  content"  (Jenkins,  2006).  Livingstone  (2003)  noted  the   significance  of  participatory  culture  technologies  in  youth  identity  development:   "while  to  adults  the  Internet  primarily  means  the  world  wide  web,  for  children  it   means  email,  chat,  games....  In  terms  of  personal  development,  identity,  expression   and  their  social  consequences--  participation,  social  capital,  civic  culture,  these  are   the  activities  that  serve  to  network  today's  younger  generation"  (Livingstone,  2003,   p.  14).        Shifman  (2011)  also  supports  the  notion  of  YouTube  as  a  site  of  participatory   culture,  describing  it  as  a  central  hub  of  user  generated  bottom-up  video  content.   Moreover,  the  site's  slogan  `Broadcast  Yourself'  reinforces  the  notion  of  the  site  as  a   platform  for  self-expression  and  participation  (Shifman  2011).  However,  some  

  

24  

scholars  have  been  more  critical  of  the  site's  participatory  culture  functionality.   YouTube  is  used  and  experienced  by  users  in  a  number  of  different  ways.  While  it   does  allow  for  the  publishing  of  user-generated  amateur  content,  the  site  also   functions  as  a  platform  for  users  to  engage  with  popular  culture  content,  ranging   from  music  videos,  television  shows,  and  film  clips  (Burgess  and  Green  2009).       

It's  Time  
   On  November  24,  2011,  non-profit,  independent  social  advocacy  group  Get  Up!   Action  for  Australia  released  a  video  in  support  of  marriage  equality  in  Australia.   The  video,  entitled  It's  Time,  was  released  to  much  critical  acclaim  and  media   coverage.  The  video  reached  2.5  million  views  in  one  week,  and  today  has  nearly  8   million  views.  The  video  depicts  the  story  of  a  couple,  showing  all  the  major   milestones  in  their  relationship  from  the  first  time  the  met,  to  experiencing  loss   together,  meeting  each  other's  families,  to  eventual  engagement.  The  video  is  shot   from  an  angle  that  only  allows  the  spectators  to  see  one-half  of  the  couple,  one  man.   The  other  partner  is  left  off  screen,  as  if  the  unseen  partner  was  in  the  place  of  the   camera  itself.  To  achieve  this  effect  the  partner  on  screen  is  seen  interacting  with   what  should  have  been  a  camera  足  reaching  out  to  it  while  lying  on  the  beach,   opening  the  door  for  it  in  a  taxi,  and  even  arguing  with  it  while  on  a  road  trip.  Louis   Althusser  (1971)  described  the  process  of  interpellation  whereby  a  viewer  or   subject  becomes  the  intended  target  of  a  message  by  recognizing  oneself  within  that   message  (Woodward  42).  While  watching  the  It's  Time  video,  spectators  are  to  some      25  

extent  interpellated  into  subject  positions,  unconsciously  becoming  the  other   partner  and  identifying  with  the  relationship  on  screen  (Althusser,  1971).  At  the  end   of  the  two-minute-long  video  the  unseen  partner  is  finally  revealed  during  a   climactic  engagement  scene.  As  the  camera  pans  out  to  show  the  couple  together,  it   is  revealed  that  the  unseen  partner  is  a  man,  and  that  the  video  told  the  story  of  a   gay  relationship  all  along.  This  reveal  may  shock  viewers  who  had  been  identifying   with  the  relationship  throughout  the  video  through  this  process  of  interpellation,   particularly  those  viewers  who  may  have  had  preconceived  notions  of  what  a  same- sex  relationship  looks  like.  Ultimately  the  video  is  communicating  a  message  that   love  is  love,  regardless  of  sex.  The  video  concludes  with  the  words  "It's  time.  End   marriage  discrimination."  and  the  link  to  GetUp's  website  along  with  the   organization's  logo.     

Method  of  Analysis  
   I  approached  my  research  with  the  goal  of  deconstructing  It's  Time  to  identify   prominent  rhetorical  appeals  in  the  video,  in  order  to  shed  some  light  on  what   makes  a  cause-related  YouTube  video  go  viral.  The  first  part  to  my  research   involved  analyzing  the  video  itself  for  themes,  content,  and  examples  of  rhetorical   appeals.  Given  that  YouTube  videos  have  built-in  functionalities  that  allow  for  an   indication  of  audience  approval  (`like'  or  `dislike'  button),  allow  for  direct  audience   feedback  (comments),  and  allow  some  regulation  of  the  video  comments  (`report'   and  `mark  as  spam'  features),  I  thought  it  was  also  important  to  analyze  viewer      26  

responses.  Therefore  the  second  part  to  my  research  involved  analyzing  a  selection   of  public  viewer  comments  left  on  the  video.        I  aimed  to  connect  the  specific  examples  of  rhetorical  appeals  that  I  found  present  in   the  video  with  viewer  responses  in  hopes  of  gaining  insight  into  what  particular   aspects  of  the  video  resonated  most  with  audiences.  For  instance,  comments  might   suggest  that  emotional  appeals  (pathos)  resonated  most  with  audiences,  or   comments  might  question  the  authority  of  the  organization  behind  the  video,  Get   Up!,  (ethos),  or  comments  might  support  the  cause  with  logic,  evidence  and  statistics   (logos).     

Data  Collection  and  Coding  System  
   Using  a  grounded  theory  framework,  I  developed  a  coding  system  to  analyze  the   video  and  comments.  To  do  so  I  used  an  open  coding  system  to  allow  for  an   unrestricted  coding  of  the  data.  I  did  have  some  initial  ideas  of  words  or  themes  I   might  look  for  when  coding.  These  included  comments  that:   揃 揃 揃 揃 揃 Affirm  that  the  user  signed  the  petition   Link  to  an  outside  source   Use  negative  language   Use  positive  language   Share  personal  stories  

  

27  

   For  the  scope  of  this  project,  I  collected  a  comment  stream  of  100  comments  from   the  month  of  April  2013,  allowing  me  to  get  a  sense  of  recent  reactions  to  the  video   (see  Figure  1).  Comments  from  this  month  were  selected  as  a  result  of  a  significant   spike  in  comments  during  this  time,  which  is  demonstrated  in  the  video's  analytics   graph         Figure  1:  Video  Statistics     

      However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  size  of  my  data  set  compared  with  the  total   number  of  video  comments  limited  my  ability  to  make  any  broad  conclusions.       

  

28  

To  analyze  the  video  itself,  I  conducted  a  content  analysis  and  again  used  an  open   source  coding  system  to  identify  tropes  or  trends  within  the  video  to  help  me   answer  my  research  questions  (see  Figure  2).        Figure  2:  Codebook      Code   Description   EMOT   Comments  that  discuss  emotion   HUM   Comments  that  utilize  humour   PROF   Comments  that  use  words  generally  considered   profanity   STER   Comments  that  reinforce  stereotypes   TROL   Comments  that  can  be  classified  as  trolling   FLAM   Comments  that  can  be  classified  as  flaming   LOG   Comments  that  make  appeals  to  logos   LEG   Comments  that  discuss  legislation  or  politics   RAC   Comments  that  communicate  racist  messages   REL   Comments  that  discuss  religion   PROM   Comments  that  are  self-promoting     HIST   Comments  that  make  historical  references   STY   Comments  that  discuss  stylistic  elements  of  the   video  (i.e.  acting,  cinematic  style,  music)   IUC   Comments  that  demonstrate  inter-user-conflict   IUA   Comments  that  demonstrate  inter-user- agreement

Analysis  
  

Rhetorical  analysis  of  video  content  
   There  are  various  persuasive  and  stylistic  techniques  that  are  used  that  make  this   video  successful,  including  strong  pathos  appeals.  The  video  begins  with  that  first   meeting;  that  first  smile,  the  spark  where  it  all  begins.  The  on-screen  character  is   shown  smiling  and  laughing  on  a  ferry  as  he  meets  the  off-screen  character,  jotting   down  his  name  and  phone  number  in  the  off-screen  character's  book  (see  Figure  3).      Figure  3:  First  meet     

      The  video  connects  to  its  primary  intended  audience,  Australians,  by  featuring   quintessential  Australian  iconography.  The  couple  are  seen  on  what  is  likely  their   first  date  at  Luna  Park  amusement  park,  a  staple  tourist  attraction  located  in  the   Sydney  Harbour.  The  video  shows  glimpses  of  the  famous  Luna  Park  Face,  a  large   entranceway  in  the  shape  of  a  clown's  face  (see  Figure  4).  The  couple  are  seen  riding   the  iconic  ferris  wheel,  a  classically  romantic  activity.  By  showing  the  couple  in  

  

30  

recognizably  Australian  locations,  the  video  is  able  to  draw  an  emotional  connection   with  Australians,  who  may  imagine  the  couple  could  be  just  like  them  and  their   significant  other.  Conversely,  by  including  quintessential  Australian  iconography,   the  video  is  able  to  connect  to  more  international  audiences,  who  recognize  that  this   video  is  representing  Australia.        Figure  4:  Luna  Park  Face     

      The  video  takes  the  audience  through  the  various  emotional  milestones  of  a   relationship,  making  strong  persuasive  appeals  to  pathos.  The  video  takes  the   audience  through  the  couple's  early  dating  phase,  showing  them  out  on  a  date  at   night,  as  the  on-screen  partner  holds  open  the  car  door  for  the  off-screen  partner.   Later  they  are  shown  grocery  shopping  together,  holding  the  grocery  basket   together.  More  Australian  iconography  is  featured  as  they  are  shown  at  the  beach   with  friends,  playing  cricket  and  laying  in  the  sun.  The  on-screen  partner  is  shown  

  

31  

gazing  into  the  camera,  reaching  out  his  hand  to  touch  the  off-screen  partner.  (see   Figure  5).      Figure  5:  At  the  beach     

      The  couple  has  their  first  emotional  breakdown  when  they  break  into  a  fight  on   while  on  a  roadtrip  to  meet  the  on-screen  partner's  parents.  Once  they  arrive  at  the   parents  house,  the  on-screen  partner  is  shown  walking  up  front  steps  to  the  door,   looking  back  supportively  at  his  partner,  a  look  of  reassurance,  almost   communicating  "it's  okay,  come  up  the  stairs"  (see  Figure  6).  The  universal   emotional  milestone  of  meeting  the  family  is  another  strong  appeal  to  pathos.  It  is   one  of  the  moments  that  really  help  to  communicate  the  overall  message  of  the   video,  that  love  is  love,  that  regardless  of  sexual  orientation  we  all  experience  the   ups  and  downs  and  milestones  of  relationships.                

  

32  

Figure  6:  Reassurance     

      Later  the  couple  are  shown  moving  in  together,  the  camera  pans  across  the  front   yard  showing  a  white  picket  fence  and  tree-lined  street.  Once  moved  in,  they  are   shown  enjoying  simple  domestic  activities:  the  laundry  blowing  in  the  wind  hung  up   outside,  the  on-screen  partner  doing  the  dishes  after  a  meal,  and  later  watching  a   movie  with  popcorn  together.        The  couple  is  later  tested,  when  the  on-screen  partner's  mother  is  sick.  The  video   shows  him  sitting  with  her  bedside,  as  she  is  hooked  up  to  a  breathing  respirator   (see  Figure  7).  The  off-screen  couple  comes  in  to  comfort  the  on-screen  partner,   placing  his  hand  on  his  shoulder.  The  on-screen  partner  is  shown  breaking  down   with  emotion,  crying  in  the  bathroom,  hiding  his  tearful  face  from  the  off-screen   partner.  This  moment  again  makes  a  strong  appeal  to  pathos.  It  reminds  the   audience  that  regardless  of  sexual  orientation  we  all  experience  loss,  and  like  any  

  

33  

couple,  a  same  sex  couple  are  there  for  one  another  and  support  each  other   throughout  a  difficult  time  like  the  loss  of  a  loved  one.        Figure  7:  Hardship     

      The  video's  conclusion  happens  as  the  couple  is  shown  at  a  birthday  party  with  their   friends  and  family.  The  on-screen  partner  calls  the  off-screen  partner  out  onto  the   grass  off  the  porch  in  the  backyard,  where  he  gets  down  on  one  knee  and  pulls  out  a   ring  box  (see  Figure  8).  The  camera  finally  pans  back  to  show  both  male  partners,  as   the  proposal  happens  (see  Figure  9).  The  music  cuts  out  to  reveal  the  loud  cheering   of  the  excited  family  members  and  friends  rushing  to  hug  and  congratulate  the   couple,  and  the  emotional  reaction  of  the  partners.

   Figure  9:  Partner  revealed     

      The  video  is  filled  with  many  emotionally  charged  moments  that  make  strong   emotional  appeals  to  pathos.  The  video  makes  a  clear  effort  to  demonstrate  that  gay   couples  go  through  the  same  ups  and  downs,  emotional  highs  and  lows,  and   experience  the  same  milestones  that  any  other  couple  does.  This  is  an  example  of   the  overlap  between  appeals  to  Pathos  and  Logos,  as  the  video  makes  strong   emotional  appeals,  but  also  communicates  the  logical  notion  that  same-sex  couples  

  

35  

are  just  like  any  other  couple,  and  deserve  the  right  to  enjoy  the  same  privilege  of   being  legally  married.       

Grounded  theory  analysis  of  video  comments  
   Through  a  grounded  theory  analysis  and  open  source  coding  system,  I  analyzed  a   selection  of  comments  from  a  period  of  high  viewer  commenting  activity,  in  April   2013.  A  variety  of  trends  emerged  as  a  result  of  the  coding  and  comment  analysis.        Theme:  Expressed  emotional  support      Notably,  many  users  expressed  an  emotional  response  to  viewing  the  video.  14   comments  were  coded  as  an  emotional  response.  These  comments  ranged  from   discussions  of  love,  to  expressions  of  physical  emotional  responses  (i.e.  crying),  to   simple  use  of  emoticons  to  communicate  emotions  such  as  happiness  or  tears.  In   seven  of  the  fourteen  comments  that  were  coded  as  "EMOT"  users  made  specific   mentions  of  crying.  For  example,  alluding  that  they  likely  support  the  video's  cause,   one  user  wrote  "The  only  way  this  made  me  uncomfortable  was  making  me  cry  my   eyes  out.  Even  then,  I  feel  better  having  done  it."  Another  user  echoed  these   sentiments,  writing  "WAY  too  early  in  the  morning  to  get  teary  eyed  at  work".   YouTube's  built  in  functionalities  that  allow  users  to  like  comments  offer  even   greater  insight  into  viewer  reactions.  For  example,  another  user  mentions  crying  in   her  comment,  which  received  50  likes  from  other  users  (see  Figure  10):         36  

Figure  10:  User  Comment  1     

   Several  users  utilized  emoticons  to  communicate  their  emotional  responses  to  the   video  (see  Figure  11  and  Figure  12).  For  example,  two  users  include  happy-tear   emoticons  with  their  comments:      Figure  11:  User  Comment  2

      All  of  these  types  of  emotional  responses  validate  the  emotional  appeals  in  the   video,  and  are  a  measure  of  the  video's  successful  rhetorical  appeals  to  pathos.        In  addition  to  comments  that  mention  crying  or  tearing  up,  some  users  referenced   other  bodily  responses  to  watching  the  video.  For  example,  one  user  voiced  her   support  for  the  video,  claiming:  "i  [sic]  got  chills  all  through  out  [sic]  my  body.  this   [sic]  is  great!!!"

Two  users  referenced  specific  points  in  the  video  that  particularly  connected  with   them.  For  example,  one  user  wrote:  "the  part  at  0:48  really  strikes  me".  These   comments  are  a  measurable  indication  of  aspects  of  the  video  that  were  successfully   persuasive  or  effective.  This  user's  comment  refers  to  the  point  in  the  video  when   the  off-screen  partner  is  introduced  to  the  onscreen  partner's  family  (see  Figure  13).          Figure  13:  0:48  Meeting  the  Family  

      With  their  comment,  this  user  affirms  that  this  specific  moment  in  the  video   resonated  with  them.  This  milestone  in  the  video's  plot  contributes  to  the  video's   emotional  appeal.  Through  referencing  a  significant  life  event  like  introducing  a   partner  to  one's  family,  the  video  makes  a  persuasive  appeal  to  pathos  足  or  emotion.   This  user's  comment  suggests  that  such  appeals  are  effective.  Another  instance   where  a  user  references  a  specific  moment  in  the  video  includes  the  comment  "Can't   blame  them.  I  mean  look  at  1:40  those  two  bastards  are  fucking  beautiful!  (Full   homo!)"  The  1:40  mark  is  the  point  in  the  video  plot  when  the  on-screen  partner

gets  down  on  one  knee  to  propose  and  the  camera  pans  to  show  both  male  partners.   (see  Figure  14).      Figure  14:  1:40  The  Proposal     

      This  comment  also  plays  with  popular  discourse  by  substituting  the  "no"  in  the   popular  phrase  "no  homo"  to  "full  homo".  The  phrase  "no  homo"  has  become  part  of   popular  vernacular,  and  is  typically  used  after  an  individual  acts  or  speaks  in  a  way   that  may  challenge  gender  norms  or  popular  notions  of  sexuality.  Urban  Dictionary   defines  the  term  as  a  "Phrase  used  after  one  inadvertently  says  something  that   sounds  gay."  The  user's  clever  play  on  the  popular  phrase  helps  to  communicate   their  support  for  the  video's  cause.        Nine  commenters  responded  to  stylistic  elements  of  the  video.  For  example,  some   comments  discussed  the  cinematic  style,  while  others  commented  on  the  video's   aesthetic  and  length.  The  comments  were  generally  supportive  in  nature.  One   notable  trend  was  users  commenting  that  they  had  expected  the  outcome  of  the  

  

39  

video  足  that  they  knew  the  off-screen  partner  would  turn  out  to  be  another  man.  For   example,  one  user  seems  to  have  been  underwhelmed  by  the  video's  surprise   conclusion,  expressing  that  they    "...saw  that  one  coming  from  a  mile  away".  This   must  have  been  a  popular  reaction,  as  the  comment  received  134  likes,  indicating   that  many  other  users  may  have  also  felt  this  way.  Other  comments  echoed  these   sentiments.  For  example,  one  user  wrote,  "Nice  vid  but  it  was  obvious  what  it  was  all   about,  I  knew  it  was  a  guy  from  the  beginning.  Still  beautifully  made",  and  another   user  wrote  "Dunno  why  but  I  knew  it  will  be  a  guy  [sic]".  Another  user  humourously   alluded  that  they  also  expected  the  outcome,  commenting,  "I  knew  those  hands   looked  awfuly  [sic]  large."  Notably,  of  the  nine  comments  that  were  coded  STY,  in   five  comments  the  users  claim  they  had  expected  the  outcome  of  the  video.  In   addition  to  comments  about  the  off-screen  partner  surprise  motif,  two  STY   comments  noted  noted  a  similarity  in  the  video's  aesthetic  to  that  of  a  Google  Glass   advertisement.  Another  user  commented  on  the  length  of  the  video,  suggesting  the   video  be  shortened:  "Cut  this  down  to  like  45  seconds".  While  many  comments   expressed  emotional  support  for  the  video's  cause,  a  significant  percentage  of  the   sample  comments  demonstrated  inter-user  conflict.           Theme:  Inter-user  conflict            The  video  brought  about  a  lot  of  conflict  between  online  commenters,  which  may   have  been  a  result  of  the  controversial  nature  of  the  video's  theme,  and  the   computer-mediate-communication  (CMC)  environment  itself.  For  example,  as      40  

previously  noted,  scholars  have  asserted  that  anonymous  communication   environments  like  YouTube  can  make  people  feel  comfortable  discussing   controversial  issues,  or  making  inappropriate  comments  that  would  not  be  socially   acceptable  in  face-to-face  communication  environments  (Herring  et  al.,  2002).   Notably,  the  majority  of  comments  the  followed  the  video,  in  my  sample,  were   comprised  of  disagreements  and  conflict  between  comments.  There  was  a  broad   range  of  disagreements,  ranging  from  differing  religious  beliefs,  political  ideologies,   and  some  trivial  disagreements  such  as  users  pointing  out  errors  in  spelling.  For   instance,  in  response  to  a  lengthy  and  emotionally  heightened  comment  by  one  user,   another  user  points  out:  "I'm  pretty  sure  its  [sic]  Guerrilla  warfare,  not  gorilla".          These  inter-user  disagreements  often  led  to  the  use  of  emotionally  heightened,   aggressive  statements,  and  use  of  profanity.  Six  users  used  profanity  to   communicate  their  disagreements.  The  use  of  profanity  ranged  in  severity.  Some   users  used  profanity  without  directing  it  at  another  user  or  comment,  others  used   profanity  along  with  humour,  and  others  directed  profanity  at  another  user  or   comment.  In  one  case  for  instance,  one  user  makes  several  aggressive,  and   emotionally  heightened  statements,  directing  profanity  at  and  actively  threatening   another  commenter.        Humor  was  often  used  by  viewers  supportive  of  the  video's  cause,  as  a  means  to   communicate  their  disagreement  with  negative  or  oppositional  comments.  For   example,  users  often  used  ironic  or  sarcastic  statements  to  combat  negative  or  

  

41  

trolling  comments.  For  example,  in  response  to  one-worded  comments  like  "gay",   one  user  communicated  the  ironic  statement:  "yes  people,  its  [sic]  gay.  Truly  a   stunning  observation".  Another  user  used  humor  in  a  more  confrontational  way,  in   response  to  another  user's  comment:  "aw  aren't  you  cute!  All  opinionated!  Too  bad   you're  a  total  bigoted  retard,  and  you  probably  believe  in  a  sky  man  who  will  send   you  to  hell  if  you  go  near  another  man's  poop  chute"      Theme:  Trolling  comments         Eight  comments  were  coded  as  trolling  comments.  Trolling  comments  involve   intentionally  drawing  other  users  into  pointless  time  consuming  discussions.  The   trolling  comments  from  the  sample  were  generally  consistent  in  form  足  in  that  they   usually  involved  obvious  or  common  sense  statements,  such  as  "gayest  video  ever..",   "was  kinda  gay",  and  "damn  this  video  was  gay".  In  some  cases,  however,  these   statements  can  be  interpreted  humorously  as  ironic  and  witty.  This  may  be  the  case   with  the  latter  comment,  which  received  123  likes.  In  some  cases,  these  trolling   comments  were  successful  in  drawing  in  more  naive  or  vulnerable  users.        Notably,  several  users  directly  called  out  other  users,  labeling  them  trolls,   particularly  during  inter-user-conflict.  For  instance,  one  user  responded  to  another   user,  "you  are  being  little  bit  awkward  with  this  same  comment  all  over  again,  man   up  troll  [sic]".

Comments  as  an  indication  of  support         I  aimed  to  connect  the  specific  examples  of  rhetorical  appeals  that  I  found  present  in   the  video  with  viewer  responses  in  hopes  of  gaining  insight  into  what  particular   aspects  of  the  video  resonated  most  with  audiences.  Notably,  a  significant  number  of   comments  expressed  an  emotional  reaction  to  watching  the  video.  14  comments   were  coded  as  an  emotional  response,  with  comments  indicating  the  viewer's   support  through  expressions  of  love  and  even  physical  emotional  reactions  such  as   crying,  and  body  chills.  This  is  certainly  an  indication  that  the  video  had  some   success  in  persuading  audiences  to  support  the  cause,  and  suggests  that  emotional   appeals  to  pathos  in  the  video  may  have  resonated  highly  with  audiences.

Discussion  

      I  approached  this  research  from  the  perspective  of  classical  rhetoric,  using   Aristotle's  persuasive  strategies  Ethos,  Pathos,  Logos  to  analyze  the  persuasive   power  of  the  video.  I  first  established  what  video  virality  means,  from  a  theoretical   perspective,  to  set  some  context.  It  was  important  to  also  establish  a  basis  for   understanding  patterns  in  online  commenting.  This  included  an  overview  of  typical   commenting  behaviour,  and  the  impact  of  reduced  social  cues  and  anonymity  on   commenting  behaviour.        Strong  appeals  to  pathos  were  made  throughout  the  video,  as  the  video  featured   many  of  the  significant  milestones  of  a  relationship.  The  video  also  worked  to  build   an  emotional  connection  with  Australians  by  featuring  prominent  Australian   iconography.  This  helped  make  the  video  relatable  to  Australians  by  featuring   landscapes,  activities,  and  destinations  that  they  may  associate  with  home,  such  as   the  Luna  Park  amusement  park  in  Sydney,  and  even  through  showing  the  couple  on   the  beach  playing  cricket,  a  popular  sport  in  Australia.        The  video's  persuasive  appeal  was  strengthened  through  the  featuring  of  strong   emotional,  relationship  milestones  and  hardships  throughout  the  video,  such  as  a   couple's  first  time  moving  in  together,  and  a  couple  experience  the  loss  of  a  loved   one.

The  video  aims  to  persuade  audiences  to  support  marriage  equality  by   demonstrating  that  a  gay  relationship  is  no  different  than  any  relationship  足  love  is   love.  The  video's  persuasive  power  is  largely  a  result  of  including  strong,  emotional,   relatable  moments  throughout  the  video,  and  adding  the  element  of  surprise  足  and   in  some  cases  shock  足  by  the  unveiling  of  the  off-screen  male  partner  at  the  end  of   the  video.    The  video  is  not  only  persuasive  because  it  features  a  visible,  committed   gay  couple,  but  because  it  shows  a  committed  gay  couple  that  is  loved,  supported,   and  accepted  by  their  friends  and  family.  This  is  best  captured  in  the  final  scene,   when  the  couple's  friends  and  family  rush  to  hug  and  congratulate  them  after  the   on-screen  partner  proposes.        By  tapping  into  the  strong  emotional  subject  matter  of  family,  the  video  really   connects  with  audiences  on  an  emotional  level,  making  strong  appeals  to  pathos.     The  amount  of  heightened  emotional  comments  left  on  the  video  is  a  representation,   to  some  extent,  of  the  emotional  connection  audiences  have  with  the  video.  For   example,  14  comments  in  the  sample  expressed  emotional  reactions,  and  two   comments  cited  specific  emotional  moments  in  the  video  that  particularly  resonated   with  them.  There  was  also  a  significant  trend  amongst  the  comments  in  the  sample:   inter-user  conflict.  This  type  of  commenting  is  common  on  CMC  platforms  like   YouTube,  especially  on  videos  of  a  controversial  nature.  However,  this  trend  may  be   an  indication  of  a  strong  emotional  connection  with  the  video,  and  cause,  amongst   viewers.

Implications  and  Future  Research    
   While  the  rhetorical  analysis  of  the  video,  and  the  textual  analysis  of  the  user   comments  provided  interesting  insight  into  what  persuasive  techniques  are   successful  in  cause-related  videos  like  It's  Time,  it  is  important  to  note  some   limitations.  For  the  scope  of  this  paper,  a  non-representational  sample  of  user   comments  was  used,  and  therefore  the  assertions  and  conclusions  made  in  this   paper  are  to  some  extent  limited  by  the  sample.        Future  research  opportunities  would  include  conducting  a  larger-scale  study  that   surveys  a  larger  representational  sample.  There  is  also  an  opportunity  for  further   research  that  incorporates  viewer  surveys  to  gain  insight  into  general  responses  to   the  video  and  its  persuasive  appeals.  This  would  provide  more  diverse  measurable   data  with  which  to  get  an  indication  of  the  videos  overall  persuasive  power,  or   success.

Conclusion  

      This  paper  was  written  with  two  key  aims.  First  it  aimed  to  understand  the   persuasive  power  of  It's  Time  through  an  analysis  of  the  persuasive  appeals  utilized   in  the  video.  Secondly,  it  aimed  to  understand  the  virality  and  success  of  the  video,   as  demonstrated  through  the  video  views  and  comments.        Two  research  questions  were  established  to  guide  the  research:    RQ1:  How  are   persuasive  appeals  used  in  the  YouTube  video  It's  Time;  and  RQ2:  What  do  the   sample  viewer  comments  suggest  in  terms  of  the  video's  success  in  persuading   audiences  to  support  marriage  equality.        The  video's  most  prominent  mode  of  persuasion  足  appeals  to  pathos,  were   prominent  throughout  the  video.  There  were  also  logical  appeals  made  to  logos   together  with  emotional  appeals.  The  findings  from  the  comment  analysis  revealed   that  the  emotional  appeals  to  pathos  were  most  effective  in  garnering  support  and   resonating  with  audiences.  While  the  strong  emotional  appeals  throughout  the   video  contributed  to  the  persuasive  power  of  It's  Time,  the  style  of  communication   common  to  the  CMC  environment  itself,  and  the  controversial  nature  of  the  topic,   also  contributed  to  heightened  emotional  responses.  While  there  was  a  trend  in   expressed  emotional  support  amongst  the  sample  comments,  there  was  also  a   significant  number  of  comments  that  demonstrated  inter-user  conflict.  This  conflict   was  often  the  result  of  a  trolling  or  flaming  comment  that  was  aggressively

countered  by  supporters  of  the  video's  cause.  In  some  cases  humour  and  profanity   were  used  to  communicate  disagreements.  In  many  cases  humour  was  used  to   respond  to  trolling  or  overly  negative  comments.        The  social  significance  of  YouTube  will  be  more  clearly  understood  with  time.  What   is  clear,  however,  is  that  YouTube  videos  have  become  a  critical  tool  in  garnering   support  for  a  variety  of  social  causes.  With  the  advent  of  social  networking  sites  and   user-generated  content  that  allows  for  both  content  sharing  and  feedback,  videos   like  It's  Time  are  capable  of  accomplishing  unimaginable  feats.
