A SIMPLIFIED MODEL OF THE THERMAL INTERACTION OF A VENETIAN

BLIND LOCATED ON THE INDOOR GLAZING SURFACE OF A WINDOW

Derek Roeleveld Masters of Applied Science Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2007

ABSTRACT

A simplified model was developed to predict the radiative and convective heat transfer in complex fenestrations systems, including the effect of solar radiation. The focus of the current work was on Venetian blinds mounted adjacent to the indoor window surface. From the perspective of convection, the model used a convective flat plate flow between the blind and ambient surroundings and a convective channel flow between the window and blinds. It was necessary to develop new empirical correlations to predict the average channel Nusselt numbers of the hot and cold walls separately. Therefore, a CFO study of free convection in an asymmetrically heated channel was performed. Then, the new empirical correlations were used to develop a simplified one-dimensional model of the heat transfer in the system. The radiative heat exchange between the blind, window and room was calculated using a four surface grey-diffuse model. Sample predicted

results were compared with existing experimental and numerical data from the literature.

Chapter 1 Introduction and Literature Review
1.1 Introduction
Climate change is a major issue in the world. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide are affecting the world around us by increasing the temperature of the earth and decreasing the amount of snow and ice in the polar caps (IPCC 2007). Air pollution is another concern due to its affect on health issues. Many reports have been made

addressing both the state of the environment and the affects of air pollution on world health. Because of this concern about the environment, it is important to develop

strategies for conserving energy. The more energy that can be conserved, the less energy that needs to be produced by polluting power plants. Again, a lot of effort has been put into researching energy conservation. One method of conserving energy is by designing buildings that are more energy efficient. This is done by using hour-by-hour building energy simulation programs, such as ESP-r (2005) and TRNSYS (2000). These programs are used to design buildings of various types and they include methods of calculating the heat transfer through a multitude of building materials, such as brick or aluminum siding, wood or steel framing, various insulation types and window designs. By using a building energy simulation program, the heating and cooling loads can be reduced by utilizing the most effective building designs. If the heating and cooling loads can be reduced, then less energy required to maintain the building at a comfortable condition. Of particular interest to this study is the implementation of window analysis in a building simulation program. Windows can be found in almost all buildings around the world because of the aesthetic appeal and the natural light they provide the indoor spaces. Due to the ability to increase the insulation in the walls of a building, most of the heat loss or gain through a building is due to windows. This has led to an extensive study of window performance without shading layers, which has led to double and triple glazing windows with low conductivity fill gases to reduce these heat gains and losses. Low emissivity coatings have also been utilized to reduce the heat transfer through a window.
IS

These design specifications affect the thermal performance of the window, which affects the heating and cooling loads in a building energy simulation program. Other programs such as WINDOW 4.0 (Finlayson et al. 1993) and VISION3 (Wright 1992) offer a quick analysis of these types of window designs under different indoor and outdoor conditions without a shading layer present. Shading devices are usually added to windows for privacy and occupant comfort, but they can have a significant impact on the performance of a window. A window with a shading device present is referred to as a complex fenestration system. One area of study is to control the natural light, called "day lighting", coming from a window by adjusting a shading device to allow the sun's light into the building. Ifmore natural light is allowed into a building, then less energy will be used by lighting fixtures. This is one area of interest for implementation into a building energy simulation program for increasing bui Iding efficiency. Another area of study, which is the area of this thesis, is the thermal performance of a complex fenestration system. The presence of a shading device in the window system will also have an effect on the thermal performance. Recent studies have

explored the thermal effects of various shading devices in a complex fenestration system. A Venetian blind is of particular interest because the blind slat angle could potentially be adjusted to control both "daylighting" and thermal performance throughout the day. Some previous studies have shown that in certain conditions, blind slat angle can either increase or decrease the convective heat transfer of the system. Also, blind slat angle has a significant effect on the amount of solar irradiation that can be absorbed and reflected away from the interior. In terms of solar heat gain the Venetian blind can be used as shielding for incoming radiation. For example, if the blind slats are closed, solar energy is blocked from entering the indoor space through the complex fenestration system, but if the blind slats are open, some of the solar energy is allowed through the system and into the room. This is very important in determining how much heat is gained or lost into a room of a building. Studies have investigated a Venetian blind located at both the indoor window surface and in-between the window glazings. This study concentrates on a Venetian blind mounted on the indoor window surface. Figure 1.1 shows a typical double-pane

window mounted in a building wall, with a Venetian blind mounted at the indoor window surface. As the figure shows, the window is placed in the wall, with the window framing holding the window in place. The window framing has its own effects on the thermal performance of the window, but the current thesis is only interested in the center glass region, which is taken as the area of the window at a distance away from the framing. For this study, only the interaction of the Venetian blind on the indoor window glazing surface with the heat transfer is of interest. This study is important for possible implementation into a building energy simulation program. Current building energy simulation programs only implement the effects of various types of windows without shading devices. If the heat transfer through a window and a shading device can be predicted by a correlation, then this can be used to predict the heating or cooling loads in a building energy simulation program more accurately. Other interest is in controlling the angle of a Venetian blind throughout the day to maximize the amount of heat gain or loss that can be obtained from the complex fenestration system to reduce the heating and cooling loads of a building.

use in residential applications where there are no occupants during the day, as personal preferences will interfere with such control systems. For example, if a person was

working at a desk next to a window, a control system might want to let as much heat and sunlight into the room as possible, but the occupant would prefer to have the blind slats closed to decrease glare and decrease the amount of incoming solar heat.

1.2 Literature Review There are two main areas of study in this thesis, which calls for a review of related literature in these two main areas. The first main area of interest, in section 1.2.1, is on the natural convective heat transfer in symmetrically and asymmetrically, isothermally heated vertical channels. The channel geometry is shown in Figure 1.2, where one channel wall is the hot wall set at temperature T H, the other channel wall is the cold wall set at temperature Tc, and the ambient is set to temperature Too. The channel walls are set at height L and are separated by the channel width b. The other main area of interest, in section 1.2.2, is on complex fenestration systems, specifically studies involving a Venetian blind.

Elenbaas (1942) was one of the first to study the heat flow of a symmetrically, isothermally heated vertical channel (in the symmetrical case: T H = T d. Using two

square plates separated by varying distances and temperature differences, he was able to obtain experimental data for a wide range of modified Rayleigh numbers. The non-

dimensional general-case correlation was developed through some analytical and experimental work. The overall channel average Nusselt number was determined to be:

asymptote is fully developed flow. Bodoia and Osterle (1962) developed a finite difference numerical solution for free convection in a symmetrically heated channel. A range of solutions was acquired for a Prandtl number of 0.7, where two asymptotes were discovered at high and low modified Rayleigh numbers. The lower asymptote approaches the fully developed flow equation:

Elenbaas' work, except at low modified Rayleigh number, where Elenbaas' results were slightly higher due to edge effects of his apparatus. Miyatake and Fujii (1972) produced numerical results for asymmetrically heated channels. The specific case of interest is where one channel wall is heated and the other channel wall is thermally insulated (unheated).
It was determined that for a Prandtl

number of 0.7 and a modified Rayleigh number range of 103 > Ra* > 300, the upper asymptote is: NUo.L'1Tmax

The upper asymptote showed a 19% increase over the isolated flat plate solution. The results of the numerical work were comparable to the experimental work of Aihara (1963). Aung et al. (1972) studied the conditions of a uniform heat flux and a uniform wall temperature in an asymmetrically heated channel flow. The finite difference method was used to obtain numerical solutions and some experimental work was performed to verify the results. For the uniform wall temperature, a nearly universal curve can be used to relate the Nusselt numbers and the modified Rayleigh numbers for a wide range of wall temperature ratios, if the Nusselt numbers and modified Rayleigh numbers are defined appropriately. A wall temperature difference ratio is defined as: (1.9) This ratio is used to define the entire range of possible asymmetrically heated channel cases. However, the results of this work only apply to the cases where fluid flows out of the channel in one direction (unidirectional flow). This applied to cases where both

channel walls are either heated at or above the ambient temperature or both cooled at or below the ambient temperature. In this study, both channel walls are heated above the ambient temperature. The average temperature of the two walls of the channel must be used as the characteristic temperature difference when calculating the Nusselt number and modified Rayleigh number: (Til +Tc) L'lT= -T 2 oc (1. 10)

Aung (1972) also investigated the fully developed flow of an asymmetrically heated channel. It was found that at low modified Rayleigh numbers (Ra* < 2), the asymptote of the Nusselt number varied depending on the temperature ratio. number at the fully developed limit can be expressed as:

Bar-Cohen and Rohsenow (1984) used analytical expressions for the asymptotes at low and high modified Rayleigh numbers to develop correlations for various channel heating configurations. By using the curve fitting methods of Churchill and Usagi

(1972), they developed correlations for both symmetrically and asymmetrically heated

plates for both isoflux and isothermal plates. The new correlations were developed to fit various experimental and numerical data and the approach was validated against the work of Elenbaas (1942), Miyatake and Fujii (1972) and others. For the isothermal,

The results showed little deviation from the isolated flat plate Nusselt numbers. A review of all the correlations was preformed by Raithby and Hollands (1998). It was determined that the best correlation for the overall channel average Nusselt number for isothermally heated channel walls is:

Other studies have been performed on free convective flow in isothermally heated vertical channels. Kettleborough (1971) and Nakamura et al. (1982) performed some Other

transient numerical solutions for a symmetrically heated vertical channel.

correlations on asymmetrically and symmetrically, isothermally heated channels have been developed experimentally by Currie and Newman (1970) and Guo et al. (1988) and numerically by Ramanathan and Kumar (1991) and Martin et al. (1991). There are also numerous studies on symmetrical and asymmetrical uniform channel wall heat flux, such as Lauber and Welch (1966), Miyatake and Fujii (1973), and Kim et al. (1990). Other areas of study include inlet conditions of the vertical channel (Chappidi and Eno 1990), unheated entrances to a heated vertical channel (Wirtz and Haag, 1985 and Campo et aI., 2004), and turbulent flow in a vertical channel (Federov and Viskanta 1997 and Habib et al. 2002). Some other variations of the classic vertical channel problem have studied recently. Numerical studies of convergent and divergent channel walls have been investigated by Bianco and Nardini (2005) and Marcondes et al.

(2006). Many other sources study the effects of various objects inside a vertical channel.
Studies include objects such as heated cylinders, (Marsters 1975 and Karim et al. 1986), a singular heat source (Higuera and Ryazantsev 2000), rectangular ribs on the channel walls (Desrayaud and Fichera 2002), an auxiliary plate (Andreozzi et al. 2002), a square cylinder (Khodary and Bhattacharyya 2006), and pin fins (Boyalakuntla et al 2004). These areas of study, while related, are not of direct interest to the present work. There are many studies that have developed correlations to predict the overall heat transfer from both channel walls of a vertical channel. However in the current study the heat transfer from each individual channel wall is required. At present, simple

correlations that can predict these heat transfer rates are not available in the literature. Part of the focus of this thesis is to develop these correlations for use in developing a simplified model of a window and blind system.

1.2.2 Studies Related to Heat Transfer in Complex Fenestration Systems
The hot and cold wall average Nusselt number correlations developed will be utilized in developing a simplified model to predict the heat transfer of a complex fenestration system. The simplified model is based on approximating the convective heat transfer between the Venetian blind and the indoor window surface as a vertical channel flow. The convective heat transfer of each channel wall is required to determine the heat transfer of the window and Venetian blind separately. There has been extensive research on the thermal interaction of the components in complex fenestration systems. There are three areas of study of interest to this thesis: section 1.2.2.1 solar optical models, section 1.2.2.2 thermal interaction of a Venetian blind located between window panes, and section 1.2.2.3 thermal interaction of a Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface. Solar optical models are reviewed because the results of such a model will be utilized in the current simplified model that will be developed. Even though the present study focuses on a Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface, a review of papers investigating the thermal effects of a Venetian blind located between window panes is beneficial because of the methods that can be used in the present study. Finally, a review of studies on the thermal interaction of a Venetian blind located at the indoor window surface is conducted to obtain experimental and numerical data for comparison with the present simplified model. Figure 1.4 shows a between-panes Venetian blind geometry and Figure 1.5 shows the geometry of a Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface. The blind-towindow spacing is W 12 and W23 in Figure 1.4 and n in Figure 1.5. The blind slat angle is
<I>

and the blind slat length is w.

1.2.2.1 Studies Related to Solar Optical Models
It is important to understand solar optical modeling because it provides an

estimate of the amount of total transmitted solar radiation, as well as the amount of absorbed solar radiation in each layer of the window and blind system. The absorbed solar radiation is then used as "inputs" into a thermal model to aide in calculating the convective, conductive, and radiative heat transfer rates in the system. Many studies

have investigated the effect of how solar radiation is absorbed into various layers of a complex fenestration system. Klems (1994a and 1994b) developed a method to predict the solar gains in a complex fenestration system. The method measures the bidirectional optical properties of a shading layer and then uses complex calculations to produce the properties of the overall complex fenestration system. Yahoda and Wright (2005) developed models for the calculation of the effective optical properties of a blind using blind slat geometry and reflectance. The models used a ray tracing technique, which is very computationally intensive. Kotey and Wright (2006) developed a simplified solar optical model to calculate transmitted, reflected and absorbed fluxes of solar radiation for complex fenestration systems. They looked at systems with a Venetian blind located on the indoor window glazing, outdoor window glazing and between two window glazings. A detailed radiation analysis was conducted to present the hour-by-hour transmitted, reflected and absorbed solar fluxes of the window and blind surfaces for a summertime and wintertime condition. All the calculations were carried out with a blind slat angle of 10° and a blindto-window spacing of 12.3 mm. Results were obtained for both light coloured and dark coloured blind slats. Wright and Kotey (2006) developed a simplified optical model to calculate the beam and diffuse fluxes of each layer of a multiple layer fenestration system. This model provides full detail of the transmitted, reflected and absorbed radiation on each layer. This model was developed with computational speed and simplicity for use in hour-byhour simulation models. An example of a multiple layer fenestration system is given in the paper: a two glazing window with an insect screen on the outdoor surface and a Venetian blind on the indoor surface. With their model, the solar absorption of the

Venetian blind is 15%, the indoor glass is 10%, the outdoor glass is 15%, the insect screen is 17%, and the indoor space is 16%. These studies are of interest to the present study because the absorbed solar fluxes that are determined are used in the present simplified model. Of particular interest is the absorbed solar heat flux on the blind,

which is needed for calculation in the simplified model presented in this study.

1.2.2.2 Studies Related to a Venetian Blind located in between Window Panes
Rheault and Bilgen (1989 and 1990) performed analytical and experimental studies to investigate the overall heat transfer rates of a between-panes Venetian blind system. They used climatic conditions of a typical Canadian winter and summer.

Conduction effects were neglected in the blind slats and the window glazings in the analytical study. A large blind-to-window spacing was used between the blind slats and the window glazings such that the effect of the blind slats on the heat flow through the window glazings was assumed minimal when at any blind slat angle other than a closed position. Their results showed the heating and cooling load of the room could be The

reduced by 36% and 47% respectively with the presence of a Venetian blind.

analytical study was verified with some experimental work. Cho et al. (1995) performed a similar study using the typical climate in Seoul (South Korea) both experimentally and numerically. Again conduction was neglected, but the heating and cooling loads could be reduced by 5% and 30% respectively. Garnet et al. (1995) determined the center-glass U-values of a between panes unheated Venetian blind system using a guarded heater plate apparatus. They studied a small blind-to-window spacing for multiple blind slat angles. Their studies showed that the presence of a Venetian blind in the window cavity improved the performance of the window when the blind slat angle increased above 35° from the horizontal, but that at a blind slat angle of 0° the performance of the window was worse than a window with no blind present. They concluded that this was because of conduction through the blind slats. They also showed that a negative blind slat angle from the hot wall had slightly better performance than a positive blind slat angle. studies on this type of system were required. Yahoda and Wright (2004b) performed studies on the effective long-wave absorbed, reflected and transmitted radiation of a Venetian blind layer using a simplified 6 surface model. This study is of great interest to the current study because a similar method of calculating the long-wave radiation between the window surface and the blind slats is utilized. Another study by Yahoda and Wright (2004a) developed a betweenpanes Venetian blind model to calculate the heat transfer through the system. The model used a simplified convective model and the effective long-wave radiative properties of They also concluded that more

the Venetian blind. The results of this work showed that the predicted U-values of the complex fenestration system were within 10% of the experimental results of Garnet et al.
(1995).

Other experimental and numerical studies have also been performed on a Venetian blind located between two panes of a window (Huang et al. 2006 and Naylor and Lai, 2007). Simplified models have also been developed to predict the U-values of these systems (Yahoda et al. 2004a). A similar simplified model to the current study has been developed by Huang (2005) for a between-panes Venetian blind. This model uses a gray diffuse radiation analysis model along with a natural convection model to predict the heat transfer of the system. A four surface radiation model of the blind layer is used to predict the radiative heat transfer of the system. The convective heat transfer is modeled by splitting the window cavity with the Venetian blind into two enclosures, with the middle surface acting as a representation of the Venetian blind. Figure 1.4 shows the system of a Venetian blind between window glazings. The convective heat transfer of the two enclosures is calculated using vertical enclosure correlations from the literature using the effective channel widths of the two enclosures. The effective enclosure widths, WI2 and W23, are determined by:

WI2

W23

= ----~

W-N·Run 2

(1.17)

where Run = w cos( ~) , w is the blind slat length,

is the blind slat angle, W is the width

between the window panes, and N is an adjustable constant. In order to obtain accurate predicted results, the blind slat Run length is multiplied by a factor N which adjusts the widths of the two enclosures to improve the predicted results of the simplified model. This factor N was determined to be 0.7, which reduces the blind slats Run length by about 15%. This model predicted U-values within 3% of the experimental work. A method similar to that of Huang (2005) is utilized in the present study. Of particular interest to the current thesis are the effective channel width and the four surface radiation methodology.

1.2.2.3 Studies Related to a Venetian Blind located on the Indoor Window Surface
Fang and Ge (1993) experimentally studied a single and double glazed window with an unheated Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface. The blind-towindow spacing was fixed, but several different blind slat angles and temperature differences across the window were considered. They found that both the blind slat angle and window temperature difference affected the results. Two correlations were

developed to determine the U-value of the system. For a single glazed window: U =0.535(2.34+0.73sin~X~T)025 where
~

(1.18)
IS

is the blind slat angle and

~T

the temperature between the outdoor

environment and the indoor space. For a double glazed window: U = 0.227(1.95 + 0.32sin ~ X~T)OA2 ( 1.19)

The effects of different frames and outer wind velocity were also considered in further experiments with a table of correction factors being used to calculate the U-value of the window including these effects. Klems and Kelley (1996) studied the inward flowing fraction of solar energy absorbed by each layer of a complex glazing and shading system. Using room sized calorimeters in a mobile structure capable of measuring the net heat flow through two windows under indoor and outdoor conditions, the inward flowing fraction of solar energy was measured. Multiple results were obtained for various types of window and blind combinations. A similar study was performed by Collins and Harrison (1999) in which it was determined that the inward-flowing fraction of solar energy was dependant on: the outdoor to indoor temperature difference, the blind slat angle, the exterior film coetTtcient, and the level of absorbed irradiance. These two studies obtain experimental results of the amount of energy that enters an indoor space from the sun through a complex fenestration system. These results can be used as comparison for numerical results and simplified models. Machin et al. (1998) performed an experimental study on the effects of a Venetian blind located on the indoor surface of a window. The local and overall convective heat transfers of the system were examined using a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. Flow

visualization was also used to determine the buoyancy driven flow and interaction with

15

the blind. The indoor window surface was approximated as an isothermal vertical flat plate because the center glass region was the only area of interest. The blind slats were unheated, simulating "nighttime" conditions. Three different blind-to-window spacings and four different blind slat angles were utilized to study the affects of the spacing and angle on the fluid flow of the system. The closer blind-to-window spacings showed more interaction with the fluid flow on the window, which showed that the heat transfer rate decreased because the fluid flow was deflected around the blind slats. The blind slats produce a periodic variation in the local heat transfer distribution on the plate, with sharp local maxima occurring near the inner blade tips when they are close to the plate surface. The maxima are increased when the blind is moved closer to the plate and decreased when the blind is moved away from the plate. The average convective heat transfer rates of the window and blind systems showed a slight decrease from the isolated vertical flat plate results. Their study examines the local convective heat transfer for all cases, but only a blind slat angle of 90° has the overall convective heat transfer presented. These overall convective heat transfer results are used as experimental data for the current study. It should also be noted that the temperatures of the blind slats were recorded using thermocouples, which will be used in the present study to calculate the radiative heat transfer rates of these cases. Ye (1997) created a numerical model of a Venetian Blind located at the indoor surface of a window. The model solved only for convection and did not include any radiation. The blind slats were modeled with no curvature, zero thickness, and no

conduction effects. The results showed the same trends as the experimental work of Machin et al. (1998), but the convection coefficients were lower than the experimental results. Phillips et al. (200 I) created a similar numerical model including radiation and convection effects of the Venetian blind. Multiple variables were adjusted to observe the effects of the blind on the radiative and convective heat transfer of the system. The results were found be in good agreement with the experimental work of Machin et al. (1998). It was noticed that when the blind slats were placed close to the window, at low modified Rayleigh numbers the convective heat transfer was increased compared to a window without a blind present. At high modified Rayleigh numbers, the convective heat transfer was decreased at the closer blind-to-window spacing. It was also noticed

16

r

that the presence of the blind reduces the radiative heat transfer significantly, even at a blind slat angle of 0°. Similar experimental studies were performed by Naylor et al.

(2000) and Duarte et al. (2001). Two studies by Collins et al. (2002a and 2002b) also examine the effects of a Venetian blind present on the indoor surface of a window. The studies represent a

"daytime" model of the system including the effects of incident solar radiation. A MachZehnder Interferometer was used to experimentally detennine the convective heat transfer rates and temperature field. Thermocouples were placed on the surfaces of the blind slats to record the average blind temperature (which are used in the present thesis to calculate the radiative heat transfer rates). Eight different cases were performed. Four of the cases studied were for a blind temperature greater than the ambient temperature with a window temperature below the ambient temperature. Those four cases created

bidirectional flow results, which are not of interest to the present study. The other four cases in which the flow is purely in the upward direction showed good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. The instantaneous heat flux agreed in both trend and magnitude and the temperature field also showed good qualitative agreement. Their study showed the same effect of maxima in the local heat flux as in Machin et al. (1998). A full parametric study of a Venetian blind on the indoor window surface was perfonned by Collins (2001). His study includes numerical results for a wide range of variables, such as varying the emissivites of the blind and window, the window temperature, the blind slat angle, and the incident solar radiation. The results of the full parametric study are used as comparison in the present study, along with three experimental results from Machin et al. (1998) and three experimental cases from Collins et al. (2002b). Further numerical work by Collins (2004) uncoupled the radiation and convection. The results showed that empirical correlations of the convective heat transfer coefficients could be possible. Shahid and Naylor (2005) performed a numerical study on a more complete window and Venetian blind system. The model was developed with a full single or double glazed window and a 29 slat Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface. The model was validated against the experimental work of Machin et al. (1998) and the numerical work of Phillips et al. (2001). Summer design conditions with zero

17

solar irradiation were used with two different blind-to-window spaCings. The results showed that the blind reduces the U-value of the window by as much as 38%. It was also revealed that a blind slat angle of 90° at the closest blind-to-window spacing produced the greatest decrease in both the U-value and the radiative heat transfer. Overall they

concluded that the presence of a Venetian blind on the indoor surface of the window improved the thermal performance of the system. Naylor et al. (2006) used this study as comparison to a simplified method of modeling the thermal performance effect of the Venetian blind on the window. A CFO numerical solution was used to determine the average heat transfer coefficients of the indoor glazing surface and the blind. This

numerical model uses a different approach in that blind slats are set to a fixed temperature and not an equilibrium temperature based on an energy balance. A database of CFO produced coefficients are required to obtain a solution. These heat transfer

coefficients were then used in a simplified model of the complete window system. They showed that a compromise is needed as increasing the blind-to-window spacing increases the U-value of the system, but this reduces the radiative heat transfer into the room. This simplified model approach showed great agreement with the numerical results of the complete window system of Shahid et al. (2005). This simplified model requires a large database of heat transfer coefficients, which for each different case a CFO solution is necessary to obtain these heat transfer coefficients. The current study is to develop a simplified model similar to Naylor et al. (2006), but to include a method of calculating the heat transfer coefficients in an empirical correlation rather than using a large database of numerical solutions. A recent study by Lomanowski and Wright (2007) developed a simplified model similar to the current study. Three different locations for the Venetian blind were

studied: on the outdoor window surface, between the window panes, and on the indoor window surface. Various radiative and convective heat fluxes were compared with the three different blind locations. Of particular interest is the case of the Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface. The convection model used in this case was modeled so that the Venetian blind was located far enough away from the indoor window surface such that there was no interaction between the two in the heat flow. Figure 1.6 shows a resistance diagram of this convection model. The blind slats are set at the blind

18

temperature, TJ and the indoor window surface is set to temperature, T 2 . Now the blind is set at a large blind-to-window spacing so that the temperature between the window and blind is at the ambient temperature, Tin. The average Nusselt number of the indoor

window surface and both sides of the Venetian blind were calculated from an empirical correlation for free convection on a vertical surface. This model may be applicable to large blind-to-window spacings, but it is not an accurate approximation for close blindto-window spacings because it does not include the interaction between the Venetian blind and window in the convective heat flow. The results were taken at a single blind slat angle of 10° and at fixed emissitivies for all window and blind surfaces. The

simplified model of this studyis also similar to Lomanowski and Wright (2007), but the convection model will use an approximation for the convection model that includes the interaction between the Venetian blind and the indoor window surface at close blind-towindow spacings. emissivities.
It will also investigate a wide range of blind slat angles and

1.3 Scope of Research and Problem Statement
The purpose of this study is to develop a simplified model to predict the heat transfer through a complex fenestration system. The complex fenestration system of

interest includes an indoor window surface and Venetian blind located at a distance from

Figure 1.6: Convective heat tramfer model of a Venetian blind located on the indoor window swjace used by Lomanowski and Wright (2007).

19

the indoor window surface. The effects of a single or multiple glazing window are not considered in this study as these models are readily available in commercial fenestration analysis programs such as VISION3 (Wright 1992) and WINDOW 4.0 (Finlayson et al. 1993). The focus of this study is on the interaction of the indoor window surface and the Venetian blind. This simplified model uses a center of glass region approximation to calculate the convective and radiative heat transfer of the complex fenestration system. The simplified model will utilize both "daytime" and "nighttime" conditions as it will include solar irradiation on the blind slats. This simplified model is designed to

incorporate multiple variables in calculating the heat transfer rates, such as varying the system geometry (most notably the blind-to-window spacing), the angle of the blind slats, the amount of solar irradiation on the blind slats, the window temperature, and the emissivities of the window and blind. The simplified model is developed based on an assumption that the heat flow between the window surface and Venetian blind acts as a vertical channel flow. In order to use this assumption in the simplified model, the convective heat transfer of each wall of a vertical channel is needed for the calculation. The literature only covers correlations that determine the overall channel convective heat transfer, so a parametric study is performed to develop correlations that predict the heat transfer of each channel wall separately. This is accomplished by conducting a numerical study using Fluent (2004). This work was motivated by the application to complex fenestration systems, but the correlations developed also have utility to many other engineering applications, such as electronics cooling and simulation of flow in nuclear reactors. Once these correlations are determined, they will be used along with a radiation model to predict the radiative and conductive heat transfer of the complex fenestration system. These results will be

compared with the experimental and numerical data obtained by Machin et al (1997), Collins et al. (2002b) and Collins (2001). It should be noted that the simplified model is developed based on using painted metal blinds as used in the experimental and numerical models. This simplified model may be useful for implementation in commercial fenestration analysis programs such as WINDOW 4.0 (Finlayson et al. 1993) and VISION3 (Wright 1992) or other building simulation programs such as ESP-r (2005) and

20

TRNSYS (2000) so they may include the thermal effects of a Venetian blind shading layer. By using hour-by-hour solar absorption and temperature data with this simplified model, this work could be also useful in designing blind control systems to reduce heating and cooling loads throughout the day.

Chapter 2 Numerical Model
2.1 Introduction
In order to predict the heat transfer of a complex fenestration system by the simplified model developed later in this thesis, the convective heat transfer of each channel wall of an isothermally, asymmetrically heated vertical channel must be determined. This chapter develops a two-dimensional numerical model to calculate the convective heat transfer data from each channel wall separately. This data will be used in the next chapter to develop correlations for use in the simplified model. The governing equations are presented and non-dimensionalized in order to obtain a general solution set for the computational domain. The boundary conditions of the computational domain are also examined. A detailed grid study is conducted on the numerical grid, which includes grid size and far-field boundary conditions. The numerical data is then validated against the experimental work of Elenbaas (1942), Aung et al. (1972), and Aihara (1963).

2.1.1 Problem Geometry
The numerical model is developed to calculate the heat transfer of each channel wall in an isothermally, asymmetrically heated vertical channel. The vertical channel geometry is shown in Figure 1.2. The two-dimensional geometry consists of two

isothermal walls of height L, separated by a channel width b. Because the two channel walls are asymmetrically heated, one channel wall is the hot wall at temperature T H, and the other channel wall is the cold wall at temperature Te. Both the hot wall and the cold wall are heated above the ambient temperature T w, such that the main buoyancy-driven flow is in the upward direction. Figure 1.2 also shows the geometry coordinate system and the direction of the gravitational force.

2.2 Governing Equations Free convection is present in this problem because of the gravitational force and the temperature variations in the fluid. The temperature variations cause density

23

gradients that are affected by the gravitational body force. The heat transfer due to this fluid motion is mathematically described by the governing equations. These equations are derived from the laws of mass, momentum and energy conservation. The continuity equation is Eq. (2.1), the X momentum equation is Eq. (2.2), the Y momentum equation is Eq. (2.3) and the energy equation is Eq. (2.4). The properties of the fluid are assumed to be constant and viscous dissipation is neglected in the energy equation. The flow is laminar, incompressible, two-dimensional, and at steady state for this problem.

the gravitational body force in the vertical direction as a constant. In order to include the effects of fluid density variations in the body force, the Boussinesq approximation must be introduced. This approximation only affects the fluid density variations in the

gravitational body force term only. The Boussinesq approximation is accomplished by defining a pressure defect term between the local pressure and the ambient pressure in the flow field:

2.3 Computational Domain and Boundary Conditions
In the present study, the non-dimensionalized governing equations (2.14) to (2.17) are solved numerically using the commercial CFD code Fluent (2004). A control-volume formulation with a second-order upwind scheme for evaluation of the convective terms is used in this solution. The SIMPLEC algorithm (Van Doormal and Raithby 1984) was used for the pressure-velocity coupling and the PRESTO (Patankar, 1980) option was used to discretize the pressure. Under-relaxation and incremental loading was required for solutions at the higher modified Rayleigh numbers, where the relaxation parameters were between 0.3 and 0.7. The two-dimensional computational domain that equations

(2.14) through (2.17) are used to solve is shown in Figure 2.1. Unheated entrances and
varying entrance geometry could be used to develop correlations that are more accurate for the specific application to the window and blind geometry of the simplified model developed in Chapter 4, but the computational domain is developed to create general case correlations that can be used in a wider range of engineering applications. The boundary conditions of the computational domain are applied to the solution of the continuity, X and Y momentum, and energy equations. The non-dimensional boundary conditions are: u * = v * = 0, T* = I u* = v * = 0 , T* = T' R

Both surfaces BC and DE have no-slip and impermeability conditions applied. No-slip and impermeability conditions are also applied to surfaces AB and EF, which are adiabatic surfaces. The fluid flows out of the computational domain at boundary CD where a pressure outlet is defined. The pressure defect is set to zero at this boundary and the fluid leaves normal to the boundary.

2.3.1 Grid Study
An extensive grid study was performed to ensure that the numerical solution was grid independent. There are two grids used in this study to obtain a wide range of data from a modified Rayleigh number of 0.1 to a modified Rayleigh number of 10,000. For the lower modified Rayleigh number range, Ra with a channel aspect ratio, ~ Ra
=

:T = 0.1 to Ra:T = 100, Grid I is used

100. For the higher modified Rayleigh number range,

:T = 200 to Ra :T = 10,000, Grid 2 is used with a channel aspect ratio of 50. It should

solved making sure that iterative convergence had been achieved. This occurred when the momentum, continuity and energy equations normalized residuals were reduced to less than 10-4 . Figure 2.2 shows the grid density study performed on Grid 1, which was solved for T~ = 0.9 and Ra

:1' = 1.

A numerical solution was calculated for multiple grid sizes,

starting with the smallest grid size of 2,876 nodes and then doubling the grid size until a grid size of 80,241 nodes. The graph shows that the overall average Nusselt numbers from the numerical solutions of all the different grid sizes are reasonably close. From Figure 2.2, a grid size of 21 ,076 nodes was chosen as sufficient for the numerical model. This grid size shows only a 0.17% change from a grid size of 10,391 nodes and a 0.14% change from a grid size of 41,956 nodes. The graph also shows that the curve is

approaching an asymptote as the grid size increases, which looks to be fairly close to the grid size of 21,076 nodes. Figure 2.3 shows the grid density study of Grid 2, which is solved for

For this method, three different grid sizes are utilized, so for these two

numerical grids, the three grid sizes are 21,076 nodes, 41,956 nodes, and 81,20 I nodes. With these three grid sizes, a critical variable is determined, which is NUO.c.T in this case. Grid I at Ra ~\T = 1 has a numerical uncertainty of 0.94% and Grid 2 at Ra ~\T = 1000 has a numerical uncertainty of 0.04%. For a detailed calculation of the Richardson extrapolation for both numerical grids, see Appendix A.

2.4 Numerical Model Validation
The numerical model is validated against the overall channel average Nusselt number, which has been extensively studied (Elenbaas 1942, Aung 1972, and Bar-Cohen and Rohsenow 1984). The overall channel average Nusselt number is defined as:
NUO.~T

.

qb =_---'---c=
2Lkf~T

(2.20)

where q is the convective heat transfer rate per unit depth of both channel walls. It has been shown (Aung et al. 1972) that the appropriate characteristic temperature difference that gives the best correlation for the overall channel average Nusselt number is
~T

.

However, the appropriate temperature difference that should be used to correlate the hot and cold wall average Nusselt Numbers is unclear. In fact, this is discussed in detail in the next chapter when fitting a correlation to the data. Figure 2.6 shows a comparison of the overall channel average Nusselt number between the current numerical solution and some experiment work from the literature (Elenbaas 1942, Aung et al. 1972, and Aihara 1963). The upper and lower asymptotes are also present in Figure 2.6, with the upper asymptote being the isolated flat plate limit developed by Ostrach (1953) and the lower asymptotes being the fully developed flow limit developed by Aung (1972). It should be noted that the numerical solutions of only two of the three channel wall temperature difference ratios are presented on the graph in Figure 2.7, T; = 0 and T; = 0.9. The numerical data agrees well with the experimental data. Interferometric measurements of the local Nusselt number distribution on the hot and cold walls of an asymmetrically heated vertical channel were conducted by Aung et al. (1972). These results are used for comparison with the current numerical results in Figure 2.7. The local Nusselt numbers of the hot and cold wall are: dTi -kf.Hb dx x=o dTi -kr.cb dx x=b Nuyc= ( ) . k f T~I -Tc

(2.26)

where kCH is the conductivity of the fluid near the hot channel wall and kfC is the conductivity of the fluid near the cold channel wall. The channel wall temperature

experimental and numerical results except near the leading edge of the hot wall. This discrepancy was also discovered by Aung et al. (1972), who explained that the temperature was slightly lower due to the apparatus construction. Another issue of note when looking at two-dimensional vertical channels is the effect of conduction losses out of the ends of the channel. At low modified Rayleigh numbers in short channels, it was shown by Ramanathan and Kumar (199]) that the conduction loses can become significant. The numerical model of this study uses a

dimensionless channel aspect ratio of ] 00 at low modified Rayleigh numbers, which is sufficiently long enough to neglect the effect of the conduction losses for the modified Rayleigh numbers of interest in this study. With such a long channel, the overall channel average Nusselt numbers calculated by the numerical solution are accurate within the fully developed flow asymptote as can be seen in Figure 2.6.

Chapter 3 Parametric Results
3.1 Introduction
Once the numerical model is developed and validated, a parametric study is performed. Average Nusselt number data is obtained for multiple temperature difference ratios for a wide range of modified Rayleigh numbers using two channel aspect ratios. This data is then plotted using various characteristic temperature differences in the hot wall average Nusselt number. However, it is shown that the hot wall average Nusselt number data is not easily correlated. The Churchill and Usagi (1972) correlation

technique is used to develop a correlation that does not clearly fit the numerical data. It is then determined that a blended characteristic temperature difference is best suited and an equation is developed to calculate this blended characteristic temperature difference. The Churchill and Usagi (1972) correlation technique is used with the upper and lower asymptotes and a hot wall average Nusselt number correlation is created that fits the numerical data. A cold wall average Nusselt number is then developed with the overall channel average Nusselt number and the hot wall average Nusselt number. sum-squared error minimization technique is explained. Finally, the

This figure shows that pure conduction exists between the two channel walls at low modified Rayleigh number. It also shows the end loses out the bottom of the channel. So, at low modified Rayleigh number, it is clear that ~ T"alls is the best characteristic temperature difference to use for correlating the hot wall average Nusselt number. Figure 3.4 shows the variation of the hot wall average Nusselt number with modified Rayleigh number, with ~ Tmax as the characteristic temperature difference in the hot wall average Nusselt number. It is defined as: Nu

(3.4)

At high modified Rayleigh number, the convective flow in the channel is strong, so the hot wall average Nusselt number approaches the isolated plate limit. In this regime, two boundary layers form on the channel walls and the fluid outside the boundary layer is at ambient temperature. A sample temperature contour plot at high modified Rayleigh

number (near the isolated plate limit) is shown in Figure 3.3(b). Two separate boundary layers are shown between the two channel walls. At high modified Rayleigh number, since the temperature difference that drives the heat transfer is ~T max, all curves for different values of T; closely approach the isolated flat plate asymptote. So at high modified Rayleigh number, ~T max is the best temperature difference for correlating the hot wall average NusseIt number. In contrast, at low modified Rayleigh numbers the

curves for different values of T; approach distinctly different conduction asymptotes. This shows that a correlation technique could be applied to the data using ~ T max as the characteristic temperature difference.

This correlation is presented in Figure 3.5 along with the numerical hot wall average Nusselt number data as comparison. Figure 3.5 shows that this correlation does not fit the data well for the modified Rayleigh number range of interest in this study. For the case of T; = 0, the correlation fits the data very well, but because the cases of T; = 0.5 and T; = 0.9 have an inflection point between the upper and lower asymptotes, the Churchill and Usagi (1972) correlation technique is unable to fit the data through the inflection point on the data curve. This shows that some further analysis of the data is required before this correlation technique can be applied to the data.

to produce a characteristic temperature difference that correlates the hot wall average Nusselt number over the complete range of modified Rayleigh numbers in this study, it is proposed to use a "blended" effective temperature difference as follows: (3.11 ) where A is a weighting function that varies from A = 1 at Ra
~
00.

:T ~ 0, to A = °as Ra ~H

Several different weighting functions with the above characteristic were tested.

The weighting function that was found to give the best fit to the data is shown in Figure

3.6 and is given by:
C A = --------))m + C ( Ra * AT ~~T---

38.583
( ) Ra~(~Tmax) I~T ~T 1 128

(~Tmax

(3.12)

+38.583

The constant C and exponent m in equation (3.12) were both adjusted to minimize the sum-squared error between the empirical correlations and the numerical data. The

modified Rayleigh number is used as the determining variable in the weighting function, but it uses a conversion factor of

~Tmax
~T

to become a general equation for all values of

T;.

It should be noted that:

It can be seen that the data for all values of T; collapse onto almost one curve. The

scatter in the data is approximately ± 10%. It should be noted that with this proposed blended temperature difference, there are well-defined asymptotes at high and low modified Rayleigh number. Given the clearly defined asymptotes, the method of

This correlation is shown in Figure 3.7 along with the numerical data. This correlation fits the data with a standard deviation of ±2% and a maximum error of ± II %. The dashed lines show ± 10% error of the correlation given in equation (3.16). The data fits well within this ±10% boundary. The cold wall average Nusselt number can now be calculated using an energy balance for the overall channel as: (3.17)

In applying equation (3.17), the hot wall average Nusselt number

calculated from

equation (3.16) and the overall channel average Nusselt number is calculated from the empirical correlation from Raithby and Hollands (1998) and Aung (1972) which is:

Figure 3.8 shows the variation of the cold wall average Nusselt number with modified Rayleigh number for different values of T~.

Chapter 4 Simplified Model of a Complex Fenestration System
4.1 Introduction
A complex fenestration system is composed of single or multiple window glazings with some type of shading device present. This can include many types of blind (e.g., Venetian or roller blind) and many different locations of the blind (e.g., inside, outside or in between the window glazings). Huang et al. (2006) studied the system where a Venetian blind is located in between two window glazings. A simplified model was produced that could predict the heat transfer of the system accurately when compared with experimental results. A similar approach is presented here, but in this case a Venetian blind is hung on the indoor side of the window glazing. The geometry of the window and Venetian blind is shown in Figure 4.I(a). For the system studied here, it is modeled as a combination of two classical heat transfer geometries. The first geometry is free convection in an asymmetrically heated vertical channel, where the correlations of the previous chapter are utilized. The second geometry is free convection from a vertical flat plate, using existing correlations from the literature. The geometry of the vertical channel and flat plate approximation is shown in Figure 4.1 (b). With this model, the Venetian blind is approximated as an impermeable vertical surface. Ifwe look at the case where the Venetian blind slats are at an angle of 90°, there is no flow through the blind slats as they are completely closed. It can be assumed that the top surfaces of the blind slats interact only with the window surface similar to a channel and the bottom surface of the blind slats interact only with the ambient similar to a flat plate. Figure 4.2 shows an experimental case conducted by Machin (1998) of a Venetian blind with a blind slat angle of 90°. In this figure, even though the blind slats are not heated, there is no flow between the blind slats showing that this simplified model approximation can be considered. As the blind slat angle decreases, the blind slats

interact with the flow, as will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter (see Figure 5.2). This simplified model uses some adjustable constants to account for the interaction of the blind slats.

A detailed description of the simplified model and the various techniques used is presented here. A detailed calculation of a sample problem using this simplified model is provided in Appendix B. This model is used to predict various results to compare with experimental and numerical data (Machin 1998, Collins et al. 2002b, and Collins 200 I).

4.1.1 Effective Channel Width
One of the adjustable parameters in this model is the effective channel width, betT. This is accomplished by using an adjustable constant, N, that changes the spacing between the tip of the blind slat to the window surface to increase the accuracy of the simplified model. This is a similar approach to the one used by Huang et al. (2006). Figure 4.3 shows the geometry of the blind-to-window spacing, n, and the effective channel width, betT. The effective channel width is defined as:
b etT
=

n - w cos(~)+ t sin(~)+ N w cos(~) 2 2

(4.1 )

where t is the curvature spacing. The effective channel width is calculated with a straight

blind slat, but because there is a slight curve in the blind slat, this creates a slight error in the blind-to-window spacing. To overcome this error, the curvature spacing is calculated: (4.2) where rc is the radius of curvature of the blind slat. The effective channel width
IS

calculated and then used as the channel width when calculating the modified Rayleigh number of the channel. The modified Rayleigh number then affects the average Nusselt number calculations (Eqs. (3.16), (3.17), (1.11), and (1.16», which affects the heat transfer rates.

4.2 Blind Slat Energy Balance
In order to develop the simplified model, a method of balancing the heat transfer of the system is required. This is accomplished by developing an energy balance on a single blind slat as shown in Figure 4.4. This is an iterative process, which is explained in further detail in section 4.2.5. The energy balance on the blind slat is:

(4.3)
where qsolar is the solar heat absorbed by the blind slat, qconv,ch is the channel convective heat transfer rate, qconv,fp is the convective flat plate heat transfer rate, qrad is the radiation heat transfer rate from the blind slat, and F I and F2 are the two adjustable fractions of the channel and flat plate convective heat transfer rates. The solar heat absorbed by the blind slat is a known quantity in this problem, as determined by an appropriate solar optical model such as Kotey and Wright (2006). The other heat transfer rates are determined in the following sections.

4.2.1 Hottel's Crossed String Method
In order to calculate the view factors for the radiation model, Fi-k and Fk-i, Hottel's crossed string method (Hottel 1967) is used. The basis of this method is that the view factor between two surfaces separated by some distance can be determined by the strings between the corners of the surfaces. The strings are represented by the dashed and dotted lines in Figure 4.5. The view factors are determined by:

Fk - i

I( I( = --'------------"---'---------'Crossed strings) uncrossed strings)
2 . Length surface k

(4.4)

The crossed strings are the dashed lines in Figure 4.5 and the uncrossed strings are the dotted lines. For further clarification, two surfaces AB and CO, as shown in Figure

4.5(a), are used to calculate the view factor, FAI3-CO: F
AB-CD

= (AD+BC)-(AC+BO)
2(AB)

(4.5)

where AD, BC, AC, AB and BO are the distances between the points. For another two surfaces, AC and CB that join at point C as shown in Figure 4.5(b), a similar method can be used to calculate the view factor FAC-CB: F
AC-CB

= (AC+CB)-(AB)
2(AC)

(4.6)

As Figure 4.5(c) shows, the corner can be moved apart to show the lengths of interest similar to Figure 4.5(a), except that the strings at point C have no length. This method was used to calculate all the required view factors for the four surface radiation model.

4.2.2 Four Surface Radiation Model and Radiative Heat Transfer
The first heat transfer rate to be determined is the radiation heat transfer rate, qrad. This is determined by a simple four surface grey diffuse radiation model. It is assumed that only the center glass region is of interest and therefore it can be approximated that the Venetian blind and window system are of an infinite length in both upward and downward directions as shown in Figure 4.6(a). Since the Venetian blind and window are of infinite length, the view factor from the window to the Venetian blind is the same

regardless of the spacing between the Venetian blind and the window. The Venetian blind can then be placed directly beside the window (shown in Figure 4.6(b)), creating an array of boxes because of this. If a single box is taken into account, as shown in Figure 4.6(c), a four surface model is left: (1) window surface, cw, Tw; (2) lower blind slat surface,

analysis is performed on this single box to detennine the radiation heat transfer rates of the window and blind slat. An iterative method developed by Bevans and Dunkel (Wiebelt, 1966) for a multi-surface grey diffuse enclosure was used to calculate the radiation heat transfer. This method requires the calculation of two equations for each surface, the radiation heat transfer, qrad.i, and the radiosity, j,. The radiation heat transfer is calculated by the amount of energy emitted (radiosity) subtracted by the amount of irradiation as shown in equations (4.7a) and (4.7b): (4.7a) where Ai is the area of the surface, Gi is the irradiation, and i is the surface number.

It should be noted that

surfaces 2 and 4 combine to give the radiative heat transfer rate of the blind slat, qrad,b and surface 1 is the radiative heat transfer rate of the window, qrad.\V. which are the two radiative heat transfer rates of interest. An eight surface radiation model was also solved by taking the four surface radiation model and splitting each surface into two surfaces. The difference in results between the 8 surface and 4 surface radiation model is less than 2%, so the four surface radiation model was used for simplicity.

4.2.3 Channel Convective Heat Transfer
The channel convective heat transfer rate, qconvch, IS gIven by the following Nusselt number correlations that were developed in the previous chapter.

The hot wall average Nusselt

The channel convective heat transfer coefficient, hb,ch is defined as:

_ Nu ·k f b eff

(4.10)

where kf is the conductivity of the fluid (air in this case), b eff is the effective channel width, and Nu is the average Nusselt number. In any window and blind problem, there are two cases to consider: (i) the case of the blind being hotter than the window or (ii) the case of the blind being colder than the window surface. The average Nusselt number in equation (4.10) is dependant on which of these two cases is present in the problem. If the blind is hotter than the window surface (i), then the average Nusselt number is NUH,"'T and equation (3.16) is utilized. If the window surface is hotter than the blind (ii), then NUC,L'lT in equation (3.17) is utilized as the average Nusselt number. The convection coefficient for the window is then defined as:

h

where Nu is dependant on the two cases mentioned previously. For case (i), Nu is

Nusselt numbers in each case. The channel convective heat transfer rate is defined as: (4.12) where Ab is the surface area of one side the blind slat, which is taken as a unit length by the pitch of the blind slats, ps.

4.2.4 Flat Plate Convective Heat Transfer

4.2.5 Correction Functions for Convective Flat Plate and Channel Heat Transfer
The correction functions F I and F2 are used to adjust the fraction of flat plate and channel convective heat transfer of the blind slat in the energy balance. The model is set with a blind slat angle of 90° (closed Venetian blind) and compared with the experimental results of Machin (1998) at the same angle. Both correction functions are set to I, so that half of the blind slat surface area is channel convective heat transfer and the other half of the blind slat surface area is flat plate convective heat transfer. The comparisons are shown in Table 4.1 and they show agreement between the model and the experimental

results. It should be noted that in this experimental case, the radiation heat transfer was determined by the same four surface radiation model explained in section 4.2.2 by using the average temperature of the blind slats recorded by the experiment. With the limit of the correction functions being I when the blind slat angle is 90°, two equations are set up to define the functions: FI =CI·{1+cos{2'$))+1 F2 =C 2 .{I+cos{2.$))+1 (4.17) (4.18)

where C I and C 2 are adjustable constants. These constants are adjusted using a least sum squares minimization procedure with a wide range of data sets mentioned in more detail in the next chapter.

4.2.6 Iteration Process of the Energy Balance
The energy balance requires an iterative process in order to obtain a converged solution. The iteration requires an initial guess of the Venetian blind temperature, T b. This Venetian blind temperature is used for calculating the heat transfer rates from sections 4.2.2 through 4.2.4. Once the heat transfers are determined, the energy balance is set up to solve for an updated Venetian blind temperature. The process is then repeated with the updated Venetian blind temperature until a converged solution (i.e. the updated and the old Venetian blind temperatures are the same value) is obtained. A flow diagram of this process is shown in Figure 4.7. It should be noted that the flow chart is for solving a given case with the constants (C I, C 2, and N) are given. (It does not include the leastsquares minimization procedure). The converged solution is then used for comparison to

4.3 Convective and Radiative Heat Transfer of the Window
The energy balance of the blind slat uses the heat transfers of the blind slat, but existing experimental and numerical results only report the convective and radiative heat fluxes of the window surface. So for comparison, the convective and radiative heat

fluxes of the window surface are calculated:

Chapter 5 Comparison of the Simplified Model with Experimental and Numerical Results
5.1 Introduction
The comparisons of the experimental and numerical data (Machin et al. 1998, Collins et al. 2002b, and Collins 200 I) with the predicted results of the simplified model are presented in this chapter. All the predicted results were calculated from the There are three different

comparisons made: (i) the comparison of the convective and radiative heat fluxes with the experimental data only, (ii) the comparison of the convective and radiative heat fluxes with the numerical data only, and (iii) the comparison of the room heat flux with both the experimental and numerical data. A sampling of some significant results are presented and discussed in this chapter, but further results are presented in Appendix C. While

looking at the comparisons in detail, some interesting patterns were present in the numerical work (Collins, 2001) that motivated an interferometric experiment to validate these patterns.

5.1.1 Least Sum-Squares Minimization
The constants (C], C 2 , and N) were determined by a least sum-squares minimization procedure. There were two sum-squared error components that were

calculated: the convection sum-squared error, E COIlV , and the radiation sum-squared error, E rad , which were both determined by comparing the experimental results to the predicted results.

in this minimization scheme. The constants are adjusted until equation (S.2) is satisfied, which means the sum-squared error between the experimental results and the simplified models predicted results is minimized.

5.2 Comparison with Experimental Results Experimental results were obtained from the literature (Machin et al. 1998 and Collins et al. 2002b) and used to compare against the predicted results of the simplified model. Upon inspection of the work of Machin et al. (1998), there were only 3 sets of data that were useful for this comparison. These were for unheated blind slats at an angle of 90°, for three different blind-to-window spacings. These three data sets are used as the base case as none of the three adjustable constants affect the results for a blind slat angle of 90°. Collins et al. (2002b) had performed experimental work on 8 different cases, but again only three data sets were useful. These were for a heated blind slat at three

different blind slat angles (45°, 0°, and -45 0). Four of the data sets are for bidirectional flow (where the ambient temperature is between the window and blind temperatures (See Appendix D)) and the fifth data set has some explained inaccuracy that made it unusable for this study. These three data sets were used to calculate the three constants to obtain better accuracy in the predicted results. The constants are calculated to be: C] = ].2], C2 = -] .05 and N = 0.24 using the three experimental data sets of Collins et al. (2002b). This shows that the channel

convective heat transfer coefficient is significantly increased with blind slat angle and the flat plate convective heat transfer coefficient is significantly decreased with blind slat angle. The effective channel width constant, N, that produces the best fit to the data is positive which shows that the effective channel width is larger than the distance between the blind slat tip and window surface. The results of the comparisons between the experimental result and the simplified models results are shown in Table 4.1 and Table 5.1. These tables show that there is moderate agreement between the predicted model and the experimental work. Table 4.] shows the comparison between the experimental work of Machin et al. (1998) and the predictions of the simplified model. The convective heat flux is predicted within 5%, but the radiative heat flux is between 18% and 26%. Table 5.1 compares the work of Collins et al. (2002b) and the simplified model. The convective heat flux and radiative heat flux

65

r
both have a difference of 20% or better. This shows that when calibrating the constants for the three experimental cases of Coll ins et al. (2002b) and using the three experimental cases of Machin (1998) as the base cases, the predictions of the simplified model are reasonable for many design I modeling purposes.

5.3 Comparison with Numerical Results
Since there are only six useful experimental data sets, some of numerical data of Collins (2001) was used to calibrate the constants of the simplified model over a wider range of variables. The numerical data sets include three absorbed solar heat fluxes on the blind slats, two different window temperatures, three blind-to-window spacings, three blind emissivities, and three window emissivities. A sampling of fifty-four data sets was taken from the numerical work of Collins (2001) to calibrate the simplified model. The three constants were calculated to be C)
=

0.58, C 2 = 0.34, and N

=

-0.19. Relative to the

experimental results only, the constants have been significantly adjusted to fit the wider range of variables. Both the channel convective heat transfer coefficient and the flat plate convective heat transfer coefficient are increased as the blind slat angle increases, which is shown by the positive constants C) and C2. The effective channel width is decreased by constant N, which shows that the effective channel width is smaller than the distance between the blind slat tips to window surface of the physical geometry. Tables 5.2 through 5.4 show some comparisons between the numerical results and the simplified models predicted results. Table 5.2 shows comparison of the case where the blind slats are heated with an absorbed solar heat flux of 25 W1m 2 and there is a blind-to-window spacing of 20 mm. The percent error of the convective heat flux of this case is under 6%, but the radiative heat flux has a percent error of30% to 59%. Table 5.3 shows the case where the blind-to-window spacing is 30 mm and the absorbed solar heat flux on the blind slats is 75 W/m 2 · The convective heat flux is less accurate with a percent error of up to 35%, but the percent error of the radiative heat flux is within 5.5%. The last comparison of the numerical results discussed here is Table 5.4, which shows the convective heat flux has a percent error of 70% to 90%. It should be noted that this seems like a large error when presented in this way, but the absolute error is quite small

as the convective heat flux is close to zero and a small quantity when compared with the dominant heat flux of radiation in this case, which is within 5.5%. This is the case where the absorbed solar heat flux is 125 W/m2 and the blind-to-window spacing is 40 mm. These three comparisons show that the simplified model is not very accurate in these presented cases. Even though not presented here, the same can be seen across all fiftyfour numerical data sets used. Of particular interest is the fact that the accuracy of the convective heat flux deteriorates as both the absorbed solar heat flux increases and the blind-to-window spacing increases.
It was discovered that at a larger blind-to-window spacing and higher absorbed

solar heat flux, the convective heat transfer predicted by the numerical work varied by a substantial amount according to different blind slat angles. For instance, looking closer at Table 5.4 where the blind-to-window spacing is 40 mm and the absorbed solar heat flux is 125 W/m2, it can be seen that the convective heat flux for a blind slat angle of -45° from Collins (2001) is -7.08 W/m 2 and for 0° it is -7.26 W/m2, but for an angle of 45° the convective heat flux is only -1.58 W/m 2 · Table 5.4 also shows that for the current model, the convective heat flux is -0.45 W/m 2 for -45°, -0.74 W/m 2 for the 0° and -0.33 W/m 2 for 45°. The simplified model can not predict a low enough convective heat flux in these cases. Between the 45° and -45° cases, the predicted convective heat flux has a difference of 26.7%, where the numerical data in these two cases has a difference of 77.7%. The model presented here cannot predict this large change of convective heat flux with blind slat angle, especially since in this model both the -45° and 45° cases are calculated very similarly. This is due to the fact that the only factors that are adjusted based on blind slat angle are the radiation model and the effective channel width. The radiation model only affects the results of the radiative heat flux and the effective channel width only varies by about 3 mm between the -45° and 45° blind slat angle cases, which is not enough to account for the large change in convective heat flux based on blind slat angle shown by the numerical data of Collins (2001). This discrepancy motivated an experimental study of a larger blind-to-window spacing and higher absorbed solar heat flux to investigate the accuracy of the numerical work.

5.3.1 Experimental Results of a Larger Blind-to-Window Spacing and Higher Absorbed Solar Heat Flux on the Blind Slats
An interferometric study was performed on a window with a Venetian blind at a larger blind-to-window spacing and a higher absorbed solar heat flux to validate some of the results found in the numerical work of Collins (2001). The same apparatus that was used by Collins et al. (2002b) experimental work is used to perform this experiment. This apparatus is the same geometry used by the simplified model in the previous chapter (refer to Figure 4.1 (a)). surface. A painted aluminum plate is used to simulate the window

The aluminum plate has a height of 379.6 mm and is set to the ambient

temperature of 295.5 K. The blind slats are from a commercially available aluminum Venetian blind. The geometry of the Venetian blind is the same as those presented in the previous chapter (refer to Figures 4.1 and 4.3). The absorbed solar heat flux of the blind slats is set to 125 W/m 2 by using two thin foil electric heaters. The blind-to-window spacing is set to 40 mm. The emissivities of the blind and the window are both the same at 0.81. Three different blind slat angles (-45°, 0°, and 45°) are used to compare with the numerical results. A 200 mm diameter beam Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) was used to visualize the temperature field. A plan view of the MZI is shown in Figure 5.1. The beam from a 15 m W He-Ne laser is split into two beams of approximately the same intensity and in the same phase. One of the beams passes through the ambient air, which is the reference beam, and the other beam, which is the test beam, passes through the experimental model. The heated air in the experimental model causes the index of

refraction to change in the test beam, which causes the test beam to be out of phase with the reference beam. When these two beams are combined, the phase shift produces a pattern in the output of the MZl, which is what is photographed and presented in Figure 5.2. The isotherms in the infinite fringe mode shown in Figure 5.2 are constructive and deconstrllctive interference fringes that are produced when the reference beam and the test beam are parallel when they are combined. Interferometry can be used to determine the heat transfer rates, but only the temperature field visualization is required for this study.

Looking at Figures

it can be seen that the heat flow is

entrained through the blind slats from the ambient and onto the window glazing. This shows that the heat transfer of the window is increased over the amount the approximated model can predict. The other blind slat angle of 45°, in Figure 5.2(c), shows that the air is entrained from the channel between the window and blind slats and into the ambient. This increases the heat transfer into the room and decreases the heat transfer on the window. Figure 5.2 shows that as both the blind-to-window spacing and absorbed solar heat flux are increased the approximations made by the simplified model are no longer valid. This experimental case also shows that the heat flow of complex fenestration

systems is more complex than initially thought when this simplified model was developed.

5.4 Room Heat Transfer Comparisons
Instead of trying to predict the radiation and convection heat fluxes separately, the heat flux into the room, q'~oom' was compared with the experimental and numerical data. This quantity was chosen because of the issue with the absolute versus relative error in the comparison of the radiative and convective heat fluxes on the window surface. The heat flux into the room is primarily of interest in predicting cooling loads as well. If we take a room as a control volume, shown in Figure 5.3, there are 3 inputs of heat transfer from the complex fenestration system: (i) convection from the window, (ii) radiation from the window, and (iii) the solar absorption of the blind slats. The heat flux into the room is: qroom ::::: qsolar + qconv.w + qrad.w

Tables 5.5 through 5.8 show a sampling of the comparisons between the simplified model and the experimental and numerical results. It should be noted that the results of comparison with Machin (1998) are presented in Table 4.1 because at a blind slat angle of 90°, the three constants do not apply, as discussed in the previous chapter. Tables 4. I and 5.5 compare the experimental results (Machin et al. 1998 and Collins et al. 2002b) and the predicted results of the simplified model. In these two tables the heat flux into the room is predicted within 24%. In Table 5.5, the window convective and radiative heat fluxes still have a high inaccuracy, with the percent error being as high as about 95%. This experimental case shows that a higher absorbed solar heat flux (150 W/m2) on the blind slats increases the inaccuracy of the simplified model even at a smaller blind-towindow spacing (15.4 mm - 20.0 mm).

73

Tables 5.6 through 5.8 are a sampling of the results of the numerical results of Collins (200 I) compared with the predicted results of the simplified model. Further

results are presented in Appendix D. All three tables show that the predicted results agree with the numerical data within 11 % for the heat flux into the room. The same trend applies as before to the comparisons in that the larger the blind-to-window spacing and higher the absorbed solar heat flux, the more inaccurate the window convective heat flux of the simplified model becomes. This can easily be seen in Table 5.8, as at both low blind-to-window spacing (20 mm) and low absorbed solar heat flux (25 W/m2), the convective heat flux is within 19%, but the radiative heat flux is within 42%. In Table 5.9, at both high blind-to-window spacing (40 mm) and high absorbed solar heat flux
(125 W/m2), the window convective heat flux is predicted within 95%, but the radiative

heat flux is within 26%. This trend is also shown across the additional 45 data sets presented in Appendix D. The window convective and radiative heat fluxes are not predicted very well with this simplified model, but the heat flux into the room can be predicted more accurately.

Chapter 6 Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations
6.1 Summary and Conclusions
A simplified model has been developed to predict the convective and radiative heat transfer rates through a complex fenestration system. This model was developed for a Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface. The solution of the simplified model applies to "daytime" and "nighttime" conditions, including the effects of solar irradiation on the blind surfaces. The model consisted of utilizing a four surface radiation model to determine the radiative heat transfer and an approximation was used for the convective heat transfer. The Venetian blind layer in the simplified model was approximated as an impermeable flat plate for the convective heat transfer. This created a flat plate convective flow from the Venetian blind to the ambient and a convective channel flow between the Venetian blind and the window surface. The convective flat plate heat transfer was determined from Churchill and Chu (1972). For the convective channel heat flow, the heat transfer of each channel wall was required, but simple correlations were not readily available from the literature. Therefore, a numerical study was performed to develop correlations to determine the heat transfer of each channel wall separately in a channel flow. Laminar free convective heat transfer in an asymmetrically, isothermally heated vertical channel has been solved numerically in order to develop empirical correlations for use in the simplified model. There are two key components to the parametric study that was performed on this data: · Multiple characteristic temperature differences were tested for the hot wall average Nusselt numbers, but the numerical data collapsed onto almost a single curve when using a blended characteristic temperature difference. The hot wall average Nusselt number data was then correlated using the method of Churchill and Usagi (1972) because the numerical data provided two clear asymptotes at upper and lower modified Rayleigh numbers.

77

r

·

A heat balance was used for developing the cold wall average Nusselt number. This involved using the previously developed hot wall average Nusselt number correlation and an overall channel average Nusselt number correlation from the literature.

These correlations were needed in the simplified model, but they will also be applicable to many other engineering applications. Once the convective and radiative heat transfers were determined by the simplified model, the results were compared with the existing experimental and numerical data of Machin (1998), Collins et al. (2002b) and Collins (2001). The

simplified model produced poor agreement with the experimental and numerical data when comparing the convective I radiative split at the window glazing surface. Because of this the heat transfer into the room was used as comparison. The simplified model predicted the heat transfer into the room within about 25% of the experimental and numerical data. When looking at the convective heat transfer more closely, two trends were observed in the simplified models predicted results:

· ·

As the blind-to-window spacing increased, the convective heat transfer decreased in accuracy. As the absorbed solar heat flux on the blind slats increased, the convective heat transfer decreased in accuracy.

Because of the larger inaccuracy of the simplified models predicted results at higher blind-to-window spacing and higher absorbed solar heat flux on the blind slats, an interferometric study was performed. An interferometric experiment was conducted with a Venetian blind located at the indoor window surface. This experimental study was used to visualize the interaction of the fluid flow between a Venetian blind and the indoor window surface for the conditions of a large blind-to-window spacing and a high solar absorbed heat flux on the blind slats. Three different blind slat angles were used to investigate the flow pattern. This study showed that: · For blind slat angles of 0° and -45°, the air flowed from the ambient side of the Venetian blind through the blind slats and onto the window surface.

78

This increased the amount of heat transfer on the window surface because the heat generated at the blind surfaces transferred towards the window. · For a blind slat angle of 45°, the air flowed from the window surface through the blind slats and into the ambient room. This decreased the

amount of heat transfer at the window surface because the heat generated by both the window and blind surfaces was transferred away from the window and into the ambient room. This experimental study showed that the approximation of the simplified model was not valid for larger blind-to-window spacing and higher solar absorbed heat flux on the blind slats. With these two conditions, the approximation of the Venetian blind as an

impermeable flat plate (with convective channel heat transfer between the window surface and the blind layer and convective flat plate heat transfer between the blind layer and the ambient room) was not a reasonable approximation to the experimental case. The experimental flow is dependent on the blind slat angle, which could not be satisfied by the current simplified model.

6.2 Recommendations Because of the complex flow found in the interferometric study, it is of the opinion of the author that there is not much more that can be done to improve the simplified model presented in this thesis. The approximation used is appropriate for

close blind-to-window spacings and a low amount of absorbed solar heat flux on the blind slats. At larger blind-to-window spacings and higher absorbed solar heat flux on the blind slats, there is a significant change in the flow pattern that requires further study and possibly a different approach to apply a simplified calculation of the heat transfer. Some recommendations for further work are as follows: 1. Further experimental study of a Venetian blind located at the indoor window surface would be beneficial. It was found that there were only a few useable experimental data points available in the literature. Most of the useable

experimental data concentrated on close blind-to-window spacings. Further experimental work at larger blind-to-window spacings would verify the numerical data used to calibrate the simplified model. Also, because of the

79

f
complex flow found in the experimental study, it would be of great interest to further examine the flow at different blind slat angles and larger blind-towindow spacings. 2. This simplified model only considers cases where both the window and the blind are heated at or above the ambient temperature of the room so that the fluid flow is unidirectional. It would be of interest to study the interaction of the Venetian blind and the indoor window surface in a bidirectional flow, where the blind slats are heated above the ambient temperature and the window surface is below the ambient temperature. This may create

instability in the flow, which might require turbulence modeling. A few cases were performed experimentally by Collins et al. (2002b), but further study both experimentally and numerically would be useful. This could be extended to develop a similar simplified model to the current study that included the bidirectional flow cases. 3. Similar to the previous suggestion, a correlation could be developed for bidirectional natural convective flow in an asymmetrically heated vertical channel similar to the method used to develop the hot and cold wall average Nusselt number correlations in this thesis. Experimental and numerical

work could be used to obtain data that could be used in a parametric study to develop correlations. Some numerical work has been attempted as shown in Appendix E. Only a few data points were obtained because the flow is very unstable. This will require a transient or turbulence model to obtain a wider range of results, especially at larger modified Rayleigh numbers. It would be beneficial not only to complex fenestration modeling, but also for many other engineering applications to have correlations to determine the overall channel, hot wall, and cold wall average Nusselt numbers of a bidirectional natural convective flow inside an asymmetrically heated vertical channel. 4. Turbulent flow in a complex fenestration system could also be studied. Many realistic complex fenestration systems involve windows of large heights, which may involve some turbulent flow. A current study at

Ryerson University involves an experiment with a complex fenestration

80

system with a larger height. This larger height is to investigate the transition zone between the laminar and turbulent zone in the complex fenestration system. It is of great interest to study the effect of turbulence has on the heat transfer in a complex fenestration system.

5.

This simplified model is for the center of glass region of the complex fenestration system only. In order for this model to be more accurate for realistic conditions, the edge of glass and frame effects should be studied. When including a Venetian blind on the indoor window surface, the geometry of the framing and Venetian blind have many variations, which may require multiple studies.

Richardson Extrapolation Performed on the Numerical Model
A.I Introduction
The Richardson extrapolation (Celik, 2006) is used in Chapter 2 to report the discretization error estimation of the two grids that are used in the numerical solution. This method is calculated in this appendix for the two grids that are used in this study. Both grids are composed of the same number of nodes, but Grid 1, used for low modified Rayleigh number solutions, has a channel aspect ratio of 100, and Grid 2, used for high modified Rayleigh number solutions, has a channel aspect ratio of 50. grids are analyzed to ensure that the numerical solution is reasonable. Both of these

Appendix B Sample Calculation of the Simplified Model
B.l Problem Introduction
This section is a companion to Chapter 4, as a sample calculation is presented here to further explain the process described in Chapter 4. The calculation is based on an experimental case performed by Collins et al. (2002b). The main properties of this case are: (i) the blind slat is at an angle,
<1>,

of 45°, (ii) the blinds have an absorbed solar heat

flux, q~olaf' of 150 W/m2, (iii) the window temperature, T w , is at 298 K, and (iv) the ambient temperature, Tee, is at 297 K. The geometry of the blind and window is shown in Figure 4.1 (a) and the geometry of the channel and flat plate approximation is shown in Figure 4.1 (b). The geometric measurements, some properties of the ambient air, and The

some constants that are used in this calculation are presented in Table B.l.

properties of air are determined from Touloukian et a1. (1970), Touloukian et al. (1975), Touloukian and Malita (1970), and Incropera and DeWitt (2002). Since this is an

iterative method, an initial guess of the blind temperature is required. For this calculation the blind temperature, Tb, is initially set to 305 K.

B.2.2: Calculating the Four Surface Radiation Model
The first step of the energy balance calculation is to determine the radiation heat transfer components of the blind and window. The Bevans and Dunkel technique

(Wieblet 1966) is used on the four surface model developed in section 4.2.1. Because all

4 surfaces are treated as opaque, Pi = 1- Ei . To start the iteration an initial guess for ji is
required, so the blackbody emissive power, ei is chosen. It is calculated from equation

B.2.3: Calculating the Channel Convective Heat Transfer Rates
The next step is to calculate the convective heat transfer rate. In this case, as per the initial guess, Tb = 305 K and T w = 298 K. Thus case (ii) applies: the hot surface is the blinds and the cold surface is the window (i.e. T H = T band T c = Tw). The various temperature differences are: From equation (1.10): tlT = TH + Tc _ T = Tb + Tw _ T = 305K +298K -297K = 4.5K 2 XJ 2 XJ 2 From equation (3.3): tlTwalls = TH - Tc = Tb - Tw = 305K - 298K = 7.0K From equation (1.4): tlTmax = T H - TXJ = Tb - TXJ = 305K - 297K = 8.0K and from equation (1.9):

With the modified Rayleigh number, the average Nusselt numbers can be determined for the window and blind. The channel correlations developed in chapter 3 are used to

determine the hot wall average Nusselt number for the blind and the cold wall average Nusselt number for the window. The hot wall average Nusselt number requires the

B.2.S Calculating the Correction Functions
The correction functions, F 1 and F2 are calculated with C 1 and C2 being determined from calibration of the simplified model with multiple data sets (Chapter 5). The correction functions are determined from equations (4.17) and (4.18): F) = C) . (I + cos(2. ~ ))+ 1 = 0.28· {1 + cos(2. 45°))+ 1 = 1.28 F2 = C 2 . (1 +cos(2. ~))+ 1 = 0.10· (1 +cos(2 .45°))+ 1 = 1.10

96

The corrective functions show that both the channel and flat plate convective heat transfer coefficients need to be increased to obtain more accurate results. This is due to the interaction of the blind slats on the heat flow in the system.

B.2.6 Calculating the Energy Balance
With the heat transfer rates determined, the energy balance on the blind can be calculated. Since this is an iterative process, the purpose of this energy balance is to determine an updated Tb and compare it with the initial guess. Substituting the calculated heat transfers into the energy balance of equation (4.3) and solving for T b:

3.81W =1.28{ -23.29W +0.079: ·Tb )+1.10.( -33.24W +0.11: ·Tb )+1.251W Solving for T b gives: Tb = 326.52K This updated blind temperature is then used to recalculate the heat transfer rates starting from section A.2.2, which would be the start of iteration 2, as shown in the flowchart in Figure 4.7. This iteration continues until the updated blind temperature is equal to the old T b. For this case, Tb equals 307.72 K when the iteration is complete. This produces a
~T

of 5.86 K. The radiation of the blind and window surfaces are: qrad.b = 1.724 Wand

qrad.w = -0.685 W. The heat transfer coefficient of the window, hw = -6.855 W/m2K. These are the only values of interest for comparison purposes in the next section.

B.3 Comparing the Results
For comparison, the convective and radiative heat fluxes of the window are required, which are calculated from equations (4.19) and (4.20): qconv,w = hw . ~T = -6.855·5.86 = -40.172

The table and the calculations show that the convective heat flux has an error of about
9S% and the radiative heat flux has much less error at about 9%. As discussed in Section S.4, the heat transfer into the room was calculated with equation (S.4) for comparison:

(q~oomLodel =q~onv,w +q~ad.w +q:olar =-40.17+-30.68+1S0·=79.ISW
The experimental q~oom is also calculated with equation (S.4), except using the experimental values of the heat fluxes: (q;oom)exp

+q;ad,w +q:olar =-20.6+-28.24+1S0= lO1.16W

This error of the heat flux into the room is determined by equation (S.6): (error) room =

The comparison of the models heat flux into the room versus the experimental heat flux of the room produces an error of21.76%.

Appendix D Comparison of Current Model Results versus the Numerical Data of Collins (2001)
D.l Introduction
Chapter 5 compares the predicted results of the simplified model with the experimental and numerical data of Machin (1998), Collins (2001), and Collins et al. (2002b). Sixty data sets were used in total to calibrate the simplified model and calculate the constants used in the simplified model. The comparison with the six experimental data sets is presented in Table 4.1 and Table 5.5 and the comparison with nine numerical data sets is presented in Tables 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8. The comparison between the predicted results of the simplified model and the additional 45 numerical data sets from Collins (200 I) are presented in this Appendix.

Appendix E Bidirectional Flow in an Asymmetrically, Isothermally Heated Vertical Channel
E.l Introduction
For the purposes of this thesis, the complex fenestration system cases of interest involved unidirectional flow. A unidirectional flow occurs when the buoyancy driven flow is in one direction. In these cases, the fluid flows into the channel through the inlet and out of the channel through the outlet. This occurs if both channel walls are heated above or both cooled below the ambient. It is also of interest to study a bidirectional flow, in which the output of the buoyancy driven flow is in two opposite directions. Such a case would be when one channel wall is heated above the ambient temperature, but the other channel wall is cooled below the ambient temperature. This type of condition

applies to a Venetian blind located on the indoor window surface on a sunny day in the wintertime. The blinds will be heated above the ambient temperature by solar irradiance and the indoor glazing surface will be cooled below the ambient temperature by the colder weather outside the building. This will cause a bidirectional flow in between the

window surface and the Venetian blind as the hotter blind will draw the flow upwards, but the colder window surface will draw the flow downwards. instabilities where the two opposing flows interact with each other. Although not specifically needed in the present study, some analytical and numerical work was performed on bidirectional flow in an asymmetrically, isothermally heated channel. The analytical work proves that when all asymmetrically heated cases are non-dimensionalized, they can be reduced to a simple range of temperature difference ratios. Some numerical results are produced using Grid 2 from Chapter 2 with multiple negative temperature difference ratios. Using negative temperature difference ratios This may cause

produced the bidirectional flow of interest. No parametric study has been performed on the numerical solutions, but the results that were obtained show that further intensive study is required.

E.2 Analytical Study of the Temperature Difference Ratio Range
For a unidirectional flow in an asymmetrically, isothermally heated vertical channel, it has been shown by Aung et al. (1972) that 0 < T; < I is the range of temperature difference ratios that encompasses all possible asymmetrical cases. This is due to the fact that when the cold wall is the same temperature as the hot wall in the channel, T; = I. If the cold wall is set at a higher temperature than the hot wall, then they switch with the cold wall becoming the hot wall, and the hot wall becoming the cold wall. This prevents temperature difference ratio from ever exceeding a value of I. This becomes a crucial characteristic of a unidirectional flow in a vertical channel because it limits the range of asymmetrical cases. Similar to the unidirectional case, the bidirectional case can be encompassed by the range -I < T; < 1. This can be proved mathematically by the following. If TH - Too > ITc - Tool, then the standard temperature difference ratio is used: *_TC- Too TR TH - Too and if T H - Too < ITc - Too I, then a modified temperature difference ratio is used: T* - TJ-I - Too RM - Tc - Too (E.2)
(E.I)

Again, this will be a crucial characteristic for further study in the bidirectional case because the range of cases is reduced. A couple sample cases are calculated to show how the modified temperature difference ratio works. In sample case 1 shown in Figure E.l(a), the hot wall of the channel is 305 K, the cold wall is 290 K, and the ambient is 300 K. In this case, the dominant flow is in the downwards direction, but there is some fluid flow in the upwards direction as well. Solving for equation (E.2): TJ-I - Toc < ITc - Too I ~ 305 - 300 < 1290 - 3001 ~ 5 < 10 T;M = TH - Too = 305 -300 = _5_ = -0.5 Tc -Tx 290-300 -10

120

In the similar sample case 2 shown in Figure E.I(b), the hot wall of the channel is 310 K, the cold wall is 295 K, and the ambient is 300 K. The dominant flow is in the upwards direction in this case, but again there is still some fluid flow in the downwards direction. Solving for equation (E.l) in this case: TH
-

Toc > ITc - Toc I ~ 310 - 300> 1295 - 3001 ~ 10 > 5

* Tc - Too 295 -300 -5 TR = = = = -0.5 Til - Toc 310 - 300 10

Both these cases would produce a different temperature difference ratio if using the standard temperature difference ratio, but by using a modified temperature difference ratio both cases produce the same value. This is accomplished because a similar fluid flow is produced in each case, only in opposite directions. This is shown in Figure E.l, where case 1 has a downward dominant flow and case 2 has an upward dominant flow. This figure shows the approximate boundary layer to show the dominant flow in each case. This characteristic range can be used to simply the amount of cases required to obtain a range of useful data.

E.3 Results of a Bidirectional Flow in an Asymmetrically Heated Vertical Channel
Some initial results were created for bidirectional flow in an asymmetrically, isothermally heated vertical channel. These results were created with Grid 2 from

Chapter 2 using Fluent (2005). The methodology of Chapter 2 was utilized to obtain the solutions presented here. The results are presented in Figure E.2, where the overall

data does not fall onto the overall channel average Nusselt number correlation of Raithby and Hollands (1998). This shows that a more detailed study is required to develop a correlation that will fit the data at negative T~. At higher modified Rayleigh numbers, there are fewer data points for the negative temperature difference ratios. This is because

· -* -1, the CFO solution would not converge at higher modified Rayleigh as TR
numbers. This is due to the nature of the fluid flow in these cases. The fluid wants to flow in opposite directions on each channel wall, which causes instability when trying to solve in the laminar regime. The flow may be becoming turbulent, which will need to be addressed in a more detailed study. It should be noted that these results are the basic data taken from the CFO solution. There has been no parametric study conducted to attempt to correlate the bidirectional flow data. A more extensive study would require a detailed analysis of the data to obtain useable correlations of a bidirectional asymmetrically, isothermally heated vertical channel.
