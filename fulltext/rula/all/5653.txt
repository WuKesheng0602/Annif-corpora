ABSTRACT

Combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes for the treatment of actual slaughterhouse wastewater

Kambiz Vaezzadeh Naderi Master of Applied Science Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University 2016

In this study, a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design with response surface methodology and quadratic programming were used to maximize the total organic carbon (TOC) removal and minimize the H2O2 residual in the effluent of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV system for the treatment of actual slaughterhouse wastewater. The initial TOC concentration (TOCo), the initial concentration of H2O2, and the irradiation time were the three independent variables studied in the design of experiments. The multiple response approach was used to obtain desirability response surfaces at the optimum factor settings. Thus, the optimum conditions to achieve a maximum TOC removal of 46.19% and a minimum H2O2 residual of 1.05% were TOCo of 213 mg/L, H2O2,o of 450 mg/L, and irradiation time of 9 min. The obtained optimal operating conditions were validated with an additional test. Consequently, maximum TOC removal of 45.68% and minimum H2O2 residual of 1.03% were obtained experimentally, confirming the reliability of the statistical model.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION

The limitationof freshwater resources and population growth in one hand and progressively stricter regulations on the quality of discharged effluent on the other hand makes the reuse of industrial and municipal wastewater crucial (US EPA, 2004; Environment Canada, 2012). Researchers are forced to develop and evolve novel technologies to accomplish higher mineralization rate with a lower amount of detectable contaminants (Feng et al., 2009). At present, the occurrence of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds, slaughterhouse wastewater, pesticides, oil and gasoline by-products, among others in water sources is a great environmental concern. Based on different living standards, economic factors, types, and the amount of contaminants present in water bodies, diverse treatment methods have been applied to achieve clean and pure water (Daigger, 2009; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Biological wastewater treatment, which is the use of bacteria and other microorganisms for reducing the pollution level of wastewater, is known as the most common and cost-effective method of treatment for almost all types of industrial wastewater (Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2009). Even though these methods are an economical choice of treatment, several types of industrial wastewater such as those from petrochemical, pharmaceutical, slaughterhouse, leather, dye, pulp and paper, and pesticide manufacturing plants, contain considerable amounts of nonbiodegradable organic compounds and refractory to microorganisms (Mowla et al., 2014). Conventional wastewater treatment plants such as biological wastewater treatment, including

1

active sludge, ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis cannot remove these pollutants; therefore, the standard regulations cannot be reached. Hence, physico-chemical processes provide a solution. Physical processes are widely used in wastewater treatment plants. These processes are based on the separation of one or more compounds from the wastewater stream. The pollutant is transferred from one phase to another due to the separation process. As a result, further treatment is required for the degradation of contaminants in the second phase. Physical methods are employed mainly to separate large settleable and floating matter, to clarify turbid solutions, to recover and recycle valuable substances utilized in the main processes, and to separate inorganic materials. Furthermore, the conventional and advanced physical techniques include filtration, adsorption, gas stripping, and others. Physical treatment methods can be used before or after the chemical processes depending on the influent nature and its concentration as well as the operation conditions. Solid matter and non-soluble compounds should be removed before applying chemical or biochemical treatment to prevent equipment damage. On the other hand, an increase in the size of the equipment will result in higher costs and lower process efficiency (Mohajerani et al., 2012) Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proven to be efficient treatment methods for degrading resistant materials or mineralizing stable, inhibitory, or toxic contaminants (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). AOPs generate highly reactive intermediates, mainly hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which oxidize most organic compounds and degrade them to intermediate products and ultimately to CO2 and H2O and inorganic ions. AOPs such as ultraviolet (UV), UV/H2O2, Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2), sonolysis, among others are of great interest and were used by several researchers to treat different types of pollutants during the past few decades (Mehrvar and Tabrizi, 2006; Ghafoori et al., 2015). These processes

2

can be described as an oxidation method based on the production of an intermediary of highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (OH second highest powerful oxidant after fluorine), in a procedure leading to the degradation of the target contaminants (Comninellis et al., 2008). The degradation makes organic chemicals smaller and more biodegradable. Even though AOPs are very efficient in treating almost all organic compounds, some drawbacks prevent their commercial applications. A high requirement of oxidant dosage, high electrical power consumption, and precise pH adjustment are some of these disadvantages, which increases the operational cost of AOPs (Klamerth et al., 2010). Therefore, combination of AOPs and physical treatments or biological treatments can be an ideal alternative to treat refractory components of wastewater (Hirvonen et al., 1998) Meat is an important part of the daily diet in numerous countries worldwide. Therefore, meat processing plants (MPPs) produces large volumes of slaughterhouse wastewater (SWW). In the food and beverage industry, 24% of the total freshwater is used in the slaughtering of animals and cleaning of the slaughterhouse facilities (Table 1.1) and up to 29% of that consumed by the agricultural sector worldwide (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2013). SWW composition depends on the type of industry processes and specific water demand varies (Debik and Coskun, 2009). Consequently, SWW requires significant treatment for a safe and sustainable release to the environment (Salminen and Rintala, 2002; Mittal, 2006; Arvanitoyannis and Ladas, 2008; Franke-Whittle and Insam, 2013; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

In Ontario, Canada, slaughterhouses and MPPs discharge the SWW into the municipal sewer system after onsite preliminary treatment and usually pay fines for the disposal (Mittal, 2006; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Due to a high level of organics and nutrients in SWW, it has been considered detrimental worldwide. Furthermore, the onsite treatment would be the best option to treat and disinfect the effluents before discharging into receiving waters (Debik and Coskun, 2009; Wu and Mittal, 2011; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). The level of organics and nutrients in SWW are expressed as bulk components such as total suspension solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). SWWs are typically treated in anaerobic reactors because of the high level of COD. Despite the efficiency of anaerobic treatment, complete degradation of the organic matter is not possible. The soluble organic matters remained in the effluent of anaerobic treatment are more suited for treatment by aerobic processes or anaerobic­aerobic systems (Gray, 2010). There are also instabilities in anaerobic treatment methods, which requires using aerobic treatment to meet

4

the standards (Chan et al., 2009). These instabilities include the low settling rate and the treatment of the ammonium ions (NH4+) and hydrogen sulphide (HS-) in anaerobic treatment effluent (Heijnen et al., 1991; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011). Furthermore, a suitable combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes is required for the biological removal of nutrients N and P (Del Pozo and Diez, 2005). According to Aggelis et al. (2001), effluents produced by anaerobic or aerobic processes alone does not comply with discharge limits when treating high organic content wastewater. The use of combined processes can also lead to a reduction in operating costs when compared with aerobic treatment alone (Vera et al., 1999). AOPs are more attractive alternatives to conventional treatment and also used as a complementary treatment option, either pretreatment or post-treatment, to biological processes for SWW treatment (De Sena et al., 2009; Luiz et al., 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; BustilloLecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Furthermore, AOPs may inactivate microorganisms without adding additional chemicals to the SWW, avoiding the formation of hazardous by-products (De Sena et al., 2009; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2015). The UV/H2O2 process are discovered to be more efficient compared to the other processes, which have been tested for SWW treatment including ozonation, and gamma radiation (Millamena, 1992; Mittal, 2006; Melo et al., 2008; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Compared to the other technologies, the UV/H2O2 process is five times faster in inactivation and inhibition of microorganisms as well as in degrading aromatic compounds (Luiz et al., 2009; De Sena et al., 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

On the other hand, the vacuum­UV (VUV) photolysis is either an effective alternative or a complementary post-treatment method to the UV/H2O2 process since it avoids common drawbacks such as the need to use high amounts of H2O2 and to remove its residual concentrations after treatment. The VUV occurs within 100 to 200 nm range of the electromagnetic spectrum and the photons emitted within this range contain a greater amount of energy than those emitted from the rest of the UV electromagnetic spectra. Several parameters including total organic contents, light source intensity, oxidant concentration, irradiation time, pH, reaction time, and output power are factors that are affecting AOP systems. Therefore, the characterization of such systems requires the consideration of crossfactor and single-factor effects using the design of experiments (DOE) to identify those factors that influence the multivariable system (Ghafoori et al., 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016).

Objectives In this study, the effects of the irradiation time, the inlet concentrations of TOC and H2O2, and their interaction on the photochemical treatment of actual SWW in a combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process were investigated to evaluate its applicability as a post-treatment method. DOE is used to overcome the limitations of conventional methods and consequently optimize the factors involved. Conversely, the response surface methodology (RSM) has been recognized to be statistically reliable to analyze multifactor systems in chemical treatment processes. The RSM considers cross-factor interactions to attain optimal responses using the minimum number of experiments (Ghafoori et al., 2012, 2014, 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). DOE was used to optimize the photochemical treatment of SWW using the combined UVC/H2O2/VUV process in a batch recirculation system by maximizing the removal of TOC and

6

minimizing the H2O2 residual. The optimal parametric values for the DOE were obtained by a Box-Behnken design (BBD) using three factors at three levels combined with RSM. A statistical quadratic regression model was also developed to predict both the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual as response variables by the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process. As a final point, the statistical model validated by an additional set of experiments carried out at optimum conditions according to the DOE results. In summary, the objectives of the present study are: 1. To evaluate the applicability of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process as a post-treatment method of actual SWW. 2. To investigate the effects of the irradiation time, the initial concentrations of TOC and H2O2, and their interaction on the photochemical treatment of SWW. 3. To optimize the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process as a post-treatment method of actual SWW by maximizing the percent TOC removal and minimizing the H2O2 residual using DOE, BBD, and RSM. 4. To develop statistical models to predict both percent TOC removal and H2O2 residual as response variables by the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1. Introduction This chapter provides a comprehensive review of SWW treatment methods as well as the factors affecting their performance and a description of their mechanisms. This chapter also describes and reviews the characteristics, environmental impacts, health effects, and regulatory framework, including the current technologies for SWW treatment.

2.2. Slaughterhouse wastewater characteristics According to the World Bank Group (2007), a meat processing plant, which is a slaughterhouse facility, consume between 2.5 and 40 m3/ton of water per metric ton of beef produced. More than 65% of the water used for three activities: cleaning, spraying and rinsing activities. The remaining 35% is associated with personal hygiene, tool sterilization, cooling water scald tank, animal handling facilities, and vehicles washing (Wang et al., 2009). The washing and cleaning procedures bring about high loads of organic content such as large amounts of blood, fats and oils, body tissue, nitrogen (from blood), phosphorus, detergents from cleaning products, and salts (sodium) from protein recovery products such as sodium lignosulfonate, are released after washing and cleaning activities. The carcass and evisceration washing procedures are the main providers of organic content at slaughterhouse plants (Wang et al., 2009).

8

The composition of SWW characterized mostly by a complex mixture of proteins, fat, and fibers (Salminen and Rintala, 2002; Mittal, 2006; Arvanitoyannis and Ladas, 2008; BustilloLecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, 2004) has considered SWW as an industrial waste in the category of agricultural and food industries and classified as one of the most harmful wastes to the environment. The slaughterhouse effluent discharge causes deoxygenation of rivers and contamination of groundwater (BustilloLecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). The common characteristics of SWW in several studies are summarized in Table 2.1, in which their common ranges and averages including TSS, TOC, COD, BOD, total nitrogen (TN), and pH are presented (Debik and Coskun, 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). High concentrations of BOD, COD, and TSS in SWW containing flesh and blood have been reported to be 200,000 mg/L, 375,000 mg/L, and 2,800 mg/L or more, respectively (Debik and Coskun, 2009; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

2.2.1. Slaughterhouse wastewater guidelines and regulations Meat processing plants (MPPs) effluent or SWW contain several constituents that may deplete oxygen in a body of water causing irreversible alterations to aquatic ecosystems and wildlife (Wang et al., 2009; U.S EPA, 2004). These components mainly are derived from fatty tissues, blood and different salts and detergents used in cleaning procedures of MPPs. The major concern of regulatory agencies in North America such as the U.S EPA, Canadian Environmental Agencies (Environment Canada and provincial Ministries of Environment), as well as the European

9

Environment Agency (EEA) is to limit the discharge of oxygen demand compounds, as BOD and COD concentrations to fresh water bodies.

The treatment systems developed by industry are frequently regarded as a regulatory obligation, increasing capital and running costs, and yielding negative economic returns. Compliance with environmental legislation should not necessarily lead to the creation of additional expenses, but can instead provide a secondary source of income. The standards and regulations governing slaughterhouses are different around the world mostly because of the differences between custom and traditions. However, two main kinds of meat processing systems are available everywhere, one that is produced in modern mechanized slaughterhouses and the other from local butcher shops. The characteristics of the wastewater, the volume of organic concentration, the plant size, the availability of technology, and compliance with local regulations are the main parameters for selection of a particular wastewater treatment. There are instances that some MPPs are allowed to discharge their effluent into the municipal sewer system after demonstrating an adequate

reduction of BOD loads by preliminary treatment, such as storage tank, land application, lagoon systems, and dissolved air flotation (DAF) (Mittal, 2006; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Table 2.2 describes the standard levels and concentration limits of organic constituents to be discharged into water bodies as recommended by different international agencies, including Environment Canada (2012), US EPA (2004), and the Council of the European Communities (CEC, 1991).

2.2.2. Environmental impacts Population growth and demand for animal products lead to the commercialization of animal products for consumption and the production of high waste volumes. The processes involved in the wastewater treatment depend on the strength and composition of pollutants (BustilloLecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). The environment capacity to degrade organic matter is directly affected by high concentrations of organic matter present in SWW. Therefore, new treatment methods have to be developed for a more efficient management of waste products.

11

The results of the presence of organic constituents in natural source waters are eutrophication, temperature changes, and dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, which will have a severe impact on the ecosystem (US EPA, 2004). For example, oxygen consumption of the biodegradable organic matter will result in the oxygen depletion for fish and other benthic organisms, leading to such problems as reproduction and developmental abnormalities, reduced levels of activity, or death of aquatic life (Torkian et al., 2003). The parameters used to determine the biodegradable organic compounds (BOCs) are biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS). The TSS represents the amount of insoluble organic and inorganic particles in the wastewater (Verheijen et al., 1996; Rajakumar et al., 2011). High concentration of macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous (N and P) may stimulate algal growth and cause eutrophication of the receiving water bodies. The mineralization of these algae may lead to the death of aquatic life because of oxygen depletion (Belsky et al., 1999). Finally, contaminants such as chromium and unionized ammonia are directly toxic to aquatic life (Verheijen et al., 1996; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

2.2.3. Health effects Soil and groundwater pollution by nitrate, chloric anions, and many pathogenic microorganisms is the characteristic of SWW contamination. Pathogenic microorganisms from cattle wastes can be also transmitted to humans who are exposed to the water body, making those areas non-suitable for drinking or irrigation purposes (Benka-Coker and Ojior, 1995; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

Serious gastrointestinal diseases, bloody diarrhea, liver malfunctions, and in some cases, death associated with the presence of viruses, protozoa, helminthic eggs and bacteria in SWWs were reported in developed countries (Gopala Krishna et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2009; BustilloLecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). To avoid environmental pollution and human health effects, SWW

13

must be treated efficiently before discharge into water bodies. (Belsky et al., 1999; Salminen and Rintala, 2002).

2.3. Slaughterhouse wastewater treatment methods SWW treatment systems are similar to current methods used for municipal wastewater and may include preliminary, primary, secondary, and even tertiary treatment. Thus, SWW management methods after preliminary treatment are various, but they can be divided into five major subgroups: land application, physicochemical treatment, biological treatment, AOPs, and combined processes (Valta et al., 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Each system has unique treatment advantages and disadvantages (Rajakumar et al., 2011). The feasibility of using individual or combined reactor types to treat SWW biologically has been examined in the past (Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). The process of land application involves direct irrigation of the SWW onto agricultural land (Bull et al., 1982; Mittal, 2006). Physicochemical treatment involves the separation of the SWW into various components, typically the separation of solids from the liquor by sedimentation or coagulation/flocculation, and removal of pollutants using electrocoagulation (EC) and membrane technologies (Bull et al., 1982; Johns, 1995; Mittal, 2006; Eryuruk et al., 2014; Almandoz et al., 2015). On the other hand, biological treatment can be divided into anaerobic and aerobic systems, and constructed wetlands (CWs). Aerobic systems are more frequently used since they operate at a higher rate than anaerobic systems. Anaerobic systems require less complex equipment since no aeration system is required. Both anaerobic and aerobic systems may be further sub-divided into

14

other processes, which have their own advantages and disadvantages (Bull et al., 1982; Tritt and Schuchardt, 1992; Johns, 1995; Mittal, 2006; Bugallo et al., 2014; Vymazal, 2014). Moreover, AOPs, which are diverse and include UV/H2O2 and UV/O3 for the oxidation and degradation of the organic and inorganic materials present in SWW through reactions with hydroxyl radicals (·OH) (Mittal, 2006; Melo et al., 2008; Luiz et al., 2009, 2011; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Lastly, the use of combined processes is a cost-effective approach that can lead to a reduction in operating and maintenance costs when compared with individual processes (Tritt and Schuchardt, 1992; Chan et al., 2009; Luiz et al., 2011; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

2.4. Advanced oxidation processes for slaughterhouse wastewater treatment The use of AOPs can also become an attractive alternative for post-treatment of biologically treated effluents. In this context, conventional biological processes do not always provide satisfactory results, especially for industrial and high-concentrated wastewater since many of the organic substances produced by various industries are toxic or resistant to conventional biological treatment (Steber and Wierich, 1986; Bowers et al., 1989; Adams et al., 1996; Pulgarín and Kiwi, 1996; García et al., 2001; Lapertot et al., 2006; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Therefore, one feasible option for such biologically persistent wastewater is the use of advanced oxidation technologies based on chemical oxidation widely recognized as a highly efficient treatment alternative for recalcitrant wastewater.

15

AOPs degrade organic pollutants by forming hydroxyl radicals (·OH) (Balcioglu et al., 2001; Bhatkhande et al., 2002; Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Gonze et al., 2003; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). ·OH are highly reactive and non-selective. This species can degrade organic matter rapidly in comparison to those of ordinary chemical oxidation processes that may take months and even years to accomplish this. The fast oxidation, in terms of seconds, of the organic matter by the ·OH species allows the use of the term "advanced" for this kind of process (Pera-Titus et al., 2004; Devipriyas and Yesodharan, 2005; Pignatello et al., 2006; Comninellis et al., 2008; Shannon et al., 2008; Bustillo-Lecompte et al, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). AOPs include photochemical degradation processes, such as UV/H2O2, UV/O3, and UV/O3/H2O2, in which UV radiation plays a secondary role in initiating the photoreaction in the presence of an auxiliary oxidant to produce ·OH radicals; photocatalytic processes, such as TiO2/UV and photo-Fenton reactors, in which a catalyst plays a secondary role in absorbing UV radiation to produce ·OH radicals; and chemical oxidation, such as O3, O3/H2O2 and H2O2/Fe2+ among others (Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). The same principles of common chemical processes associated with redox reactions also govern AOPs, which involve the exchange of electrons between chemical species, leading to a change in the oxidation state of different compounds taking place in the process (Sawyer et al., 2002). In redox reactions, the compounds gaining electrons are known as oxidizing agents, while compounds losing electrons are known as reducing agents. Thus, ·OH radicals, produced from AOPs, are strong oxidizing agents, which are highly reactive with organic matters. The exchange of electrons between an oxidant and a reducer is spearheaded by the difference in their standard electrode potential (Eo). ·OH intermediates have one of the highest electrical oxidation potentials (EOP) (2.80V) among all typical chemical oxidizing agents used in

16

water and wastewater treatment technologies as shown in Table 2.4 (Barrera et al., 2012; BustilloLecompte et al., 2013; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

Table 2.4. Standard electrode potential of selected oxidant species. (Adopted from Tarr, 2003) Oxidant Fluorine (F) Hydroxyl radical (·OH) Atomic oxygen (O) Ozone (O3) Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Permanganate ion (MnO42­) Hypochlorous acid (HClO) Chlorine (Cl) Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) Bromine (Br) Electrical oxidation potentials (V) 3.03 2.80 2.42 2.07 1.77 1.67 1.49 1.36 1.27 1.09

Furthermore, hydroxyl radicals (·OH), which have a high oxidation potential, attack organic molecules by either abstracting or adding a hydrogen atom to double bonds, thus allowing their mineralization to non-toxic forms such as carbon dioxide and water. Studies carried out by Sigge et al. (2002) demonstrated the feasibility of this process in further reducing the TOC contents of anaerobic effluents, when using ozone and ozone/hydrogen peroxide in combination with a granular activated carbon contacting column. In one study, colour and COD reductions ranged from 66 to 90% and from 27 to 55%, respectively (Chernicharo, 2006). In some cases, the mineralization of an organic compound cannot be reached, but the toxicity of the parent compound is reduced and eventually it can be treated by cheaper methods such as biological treatment (Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2014). The chemical oxidation for complete mineralization is expensive because the oxidation intermediates, formed during treatment, tend to be more and more resistant to their total chemical degradation. Moreover, they all consume energy (e.g. UV radiation, ozone) and chemical reagents
17

like catalysts and oxidizers, which increase with treatment time. Appropriate techniques must be combined to provide technically and economically feasible options (Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). In combined chemical and biological wastewater treatment, it is very important to keep in mind how the characteristics of each treatment, such as the chemical oxidant to be used, can improve the destruction of a persistent contaminant (Liu et al., 2008; Comninellis et al., 2008; Klavarioti et al., 2009). The rest of the aspects to be considered are also widely known: the chemical oxidation capacity (Jones et al., 1985; Lee and Carberry, 1992), its potential for forming toxic intermediates (Bowers et al., 1989; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2014), a change in pollutant behaviour (Miller et al., 1988), the choice of biological agent, the comparison of different cultures (Lee and Carberry, 1992), the comparison of acclimated and non-acclimated cultures (Bowers et al., 1989; Hu and Yu, 1994), and the use of monospecific cultures and anaerobic cultures (Koyama et al., 1994; Adams et al., 1996). The measurement of the combined process efficiency depends on the purpose of the treatment, but normally requires the independent optimization of each chemical and biological step (Oller et al., 2011).

2.4.1. UV/H2O2 process H2O2 and O3 are chemical compounds that can be considered as auxiliary oxidants when coupled with UV radiation, usually under the UVC region of the electromagnetic spectrum between 200 to 280 nm as shown in Table 2.5 to produce ·OH species. The UV/H2O2 process, one of the most widely AOPs, is an effective technology for industrial wastewater treatment (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004; Aye et al., 2004; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2012). The degradation and disinfection of pollutants in the UV/H2O2 process rely on highly reactive species,

18

where ·OH are produced from the reaction of the H2O2 with the UV light (Glaze, 1987; Edalatmanesh et al., 2008; Mohajerani et al., 2012).

The UV/H2O2 process uses ultraviolet radiation to cleave the O­O bond in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and generate hydroxyl radicals. The ·OH can be then scavenged by an organic compound to initiate a radical chain degradation of H2O2 in the series of reactions shown below (Glaze, 1987; Andreozzie et al., 2000):

The quantum yield () of a radiation-induced process can be defined as the number of molecules that react per photon absorbed by the system. This event may represent a chemical reaction and be calculable by Equations (2.6) and (2.7) (Zepp, 1978).

where, [TOC] = quantum yield for TOC removal (mol/E); t = time (s); ks() = specific rate of light absorption by TOC (E/mol.s); q0 = incident photon irradiance (E/cm2.s);  = molar absorption coefficient of TOC (1/M.cm);  = absorption coefficient (1/cm); r = nominal radius of the photoreactor (cm); and Ri = inner radius of the photoreactor (cm).

A recombination of hydroxyl radicals (Reaction 2.8) should be avoided by finding the optimum H2O2 concentration inherent to the specific contaminant and system configuration (Oppenländer, 2003).

In addition to radical recombination, the UVC/H2O2 process effectiveness is also delayed by the H2O2 low molar absorption coefficient, 18.6/M.cm at 254nm, which is responsible for large amounts of H2O2 being added to produce significant concentrations of ·OH radicals within the system. Moreover, any post-treatment surplus of the H2O2 concentration should be removed from the effluent; otherwise, it could enter source waters, causing adverse effects on fish and other living communities due to the toxicity threshold of H2O2 (Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2014). The major photochemical and chemical reactions taking place in the UV/H2O2 process can be described as shown in Table 2.6.

Bovine catalase is the most common compound used to remove excess H2O2, which converts H2O2 into water and oxygen, as shown in Reaction (2.25) (Chelikani et al., 2004). In

21

particular, the low molar absorption coefficient and the use of compounds to control the H2O2 concentration in the effluent have a significant impact on the total cost of the AOP process.

For a UV/H2O2 process to be efficient, the H2O2 concentration has to be at an optimal level to maximize the absorption of the incident photons, while the presence of other water compounds that may compete for the absorption of radiation must be minimized. The optimum H2O2 concentration also helps to minimize the recombination mechanisms as well as H2O2 effluent concentration surplus (Barrera et al., 2012). The advantages of the UV/H2O2 process include a large range of applications, enhancing the degradation of pollutants, accelerating the rate of oxidation with great potentials for disinfection and comprehensive mineralization of pollutants in wastewater (Aye et al., 2004; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014, 2016). The successful applications of the UV/H2O2 process are shown in various wastewater treatment systems such as textile dye wastewater with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 510 mg/L (Aye et al., 2004), atrazine wastewater with 99% degradation in less than 15 min (Beltrán et al., 1993), linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS) wastewater with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 5,000 mg/L (Venhuis and Mehrvar, 2005), LAS wastewater in a pilot-plant photoreactor with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 720 mg/L (Mehrvar and Tabrizi, 2006), cotton dyeing wastewater with 80% of TOC removal in 2 h with an optimum H2O2 concentration of 3,944 mg/L (Shu, 2006), and actual SWW with 81% TOC removal in a UV/H2O2 continuous

22

photoreactor with recycle using an optimum H2O2 concentration of 860 mg/L (Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). In terms of disinfection the UV systems have been proved to be highly effective in bacteria inactivation with 99.9% of complete inibition in 27.6 seconds (Barrera et al., 2012). According to Bolton et al. (2001), the overall kinetics in terms of the rate of removal of a particular component, including TOC, can often be described by simple rate expressions that are either zero-order or first-order. Consequently, AOPs such as UV/H2O2 can be modeled by the following mechanisms:

where, R1 = reaction rate of ·OH (mg/L.h); R2 = reaction rate of ·OH with TOC (mg/L.h); R3 = reaction rate of ·OH with a scavenger (Si) (mg/L.h);  = constant that depends on the type of AOP (mg/h.W) p = power rating for the system (W); VT = treated SWW volume (L); Si = a scavenger for the ·OH, where i = a, b, ..., n (mg/L); and kTOC and kSi = second-order rate constants (L/mg.h). According to Bolton et al. (2001), a steady-state analysis of this general mechanism yields the overall rate kinetic for the UV/H2O2 process as shown in Equation (2.29). This simple

23

mechanism is either zero- or first-order for TOC. If the concentration of TOC is high ( []    [ ]), the reaction rate will be zero-order in TOC as shown in Equation (2.30). On the other hand, if the concentration of TOC is low ( []    [ ]), the reaction rate will be first-order in TOC as shown in Equation (2.31). The difference between "high" and "low" concentration varies considerably with the system but is often approximately 100 mg/L.

2.4.2. Photolysis of slaughterhouse wastewater by VUV The VUV photolysis positions itself as an excellent alternative to the UV/H2O2 process since it avoids common drawbacks such as the need to use high amounts of H2O2 and to remove residual concentrations after treatment. The VUV occurs within 100 to 200 nm range of the electromagnetic spectrum and the photons emitted within this range contain a greater amount of energy than those emitted from the rest of the UV electromagnetic spectra (VIS, UVA, UVB, and UVC). For example, one mole of photons, emitted at 254 nm (UV-C), contains 471 kJ, while one mole of photons, at 185 nm (VUV), contains 647 kJ (U.S EPA, 1998). The water molecule starts absorbing radiation from 498 kJ/mol and higher, the condition that is met by the high energy VUV photons, which causes the cleavage of the water molecule as shown in Reaction (2.32). As a result, hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) radicals are generated
24

as primary species (Barrera et al., 2012). In addition, hydrated electrons (eaq­) are produced in lesser amounts shown in Reaction (2.33). Although H and hydrated eaq­ play a minor role in the oxidation of organic matter, they are part of the reaction and, therefore, must be included in the oxidation cycle for the final mineralization of the organic carbon. Hydrated electrons (eaq­) react with dissolved molecular oxygen to form superoxide radical anions (O2­), whose conjugated acid HO2 with a pKA value of 4.8 implies that (O2­) is a weak base in water. The hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) can disproportionate to form molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which results in a shifted equilibrium to the right of Reaction (2.34), generating an increased basicity of the superoxyl radical (O2­). Likewise, the hydrogen radicals formed during the VUV/H2O2 process are transformed into HO2 by a quick reaction with dissolved molecular oxygen (Reaction 2.36). Therefore, the water molecule (H2O) can be labeled as an auxiliary oxidant (similar to H2O2) because of the participation of eaq­ and H as reductive species in the oxidative cycle (Reactions 2.34 to 2.36).

Figure 2.1 describes the general mechanisms by which an organic compound is oxidized and mineralized by different species generated during the VUV photolysis of water. The types of saturated aliphatic or aromatic organic compounds (RH) that can be degraded by the VUV

photolysis of water include trichloromethane, CHCl3, or 1,1,1-trichloroethane, CH3-CCl3, while unsaturated organic compounds include trichloroethylene (CH=CCl2), trichloroethene, (Cl2C=CClH), or tetrachloroethene, (Cl2C=CCl2). A general oxidation pattern of organic matter carried out by VUV and UV/H2O2 photolytic processes are described in Reaction (2.37), where the parent compound is oxidized by OH radicals producing intermediate compounds and finally mineralized to carbon dioxide and water. Intermediates include compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. After a C-C cleavage, these intermediates are further degraded producing formic, acetic, and oxalic acids before finally being mineralized to CO2 and H2O.

Currently, there are different ways to produce VUV radiation: via low pressure (LP) and medium pressure (MP) mercury lamps as well as excimer lamps. LP mercury lamps emit mostly monochromatic radiation at 254 nm, yet some radiation is also emitted at 185 nm. The wavelength of 185 nm can be harnessed by using high purity quartz sleeves (known as suprasil quartz) with a relative VUV output efficiency of about 10% of that of the 254 nm emissions. By contrast, emissions at 254 nm could reach efficiencies of about 60%. Low-pressure mercury lamps are usually limited to less than 300 W of electric input (Barrera et al., 2012).

Another type of lamps is an MP mercury lamp that can emit polychromatic radiation at different emission regions, including UV-C (15-23%), UV-B (6­7 %), UV-A (~ 8%), VIS (~15%), and IR (47­55%). By using a suprasil quartz sleeve, the VUV (185 nm) can be also harnessed obtaining efficiencies of around 20% of that of the UV-C output. Most recently, xenon excimers (Xe2*) lamps (i.e. dimers consisting of two atoms of the same structure) have been gaining appeal for VUV production, as they produce VUV at 172 nm, a stronger wavelength, and may reach efficiencies of about 60%. Consequently, xenon excimer lamps are becoming an excellent alternative to the VUV production that is efficient and more powerful wavelength (172 nm) in comparison to LP and MP mercury lamps.

Need for combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes for slaughterhouse wastewater treatment AOPs are becoming more appealing to serve as a complementary treatment in either pre-treatment or post-treatment of biological processes. Additionally, AOPs may inactivate bacteria without adding any additional chemicals to the wastewater in comparison to other techniques such as chlorination or ozonation processes that are commonly used in disinfection of water streams; thus, avoiding the possible formation of hazardous by-products (Barrera et al., 2012). AOPs have been recently used for the elimination and degradation of organics in wastewaters, water reuse and pollution control issues showing excellent overall results (De Sena et al., 2009; Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014, 2016). Considering the most common treatment technologies applied in meat processing plants, the question is whether or not it is justified to complement biological treatment with a pretreatment or post-treatment process carried out by AOPs. The answer can be directly linked to

28

factors such as biodegradability, form (colloidal, suspended, or dissolved), and toxicity or inhibitory characteristics of the organic and inorganic constituents unique to each wastewater (Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). A variety of organic compounds toxic to bacteria includes aromatic compounds, halogenated compounds, oils, lipophilic solvents, and anionic surfactants. For instance, aromatic compounds, such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes are also highly toxic to bacteria. Similarly, compounds such as chloroform, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, and methylene chloride as halogenated solvents used in manufacturing dyes, pharmaceuticals, and plastics are highly toxic to bacteria used in wastewater treatment (Barrera et al., 2012). All compounds mentioned above have a common characteristic in that they are non-ionic in charge or structure, thus, causing them to dissolve rapidly into the cell wall exerting toxicity. As a result, undesired effects such as treatment efficiency losses, discharge permit violations, and operational cost increments may arise if these sorts of compounds are not removed before biological treatment. In this case, a pre-treatment process by AOPs should be conducted to eliminate recalcitrant and toxic compounds, maximizing the efficiency of the biological treatment. Table 2.7 summarizes recent studies carried out on AOPs, namely UV-C/H2O2 and VUV, alone and combined with biological treatment and its effectiveness in removing organic compounds from SWW as well as so-called emerging contaminants, such as bisphenol A (BPA), pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), personal care products (PCPs), perfluorinated surfactants, and other contaminants from surface waters, whereby AOPs are becoming more appealing to serve as complementary treatment either in a pre or post-treatment stage, to current biological processes. Besides, AOPs inactivate bacteria without adding any additional chemicals to the water, unlike the chlorination or ozonation disinfection processes, thereby avoiding the formation of hazardous by-products (Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015).

2.6. Concluding remarks It is evident that conventional wastewater treatment processes, mainly biological processes, are suitable for achieving organic matter removal. However, toxic compounds derived from industrial processes, such as manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, dyes, or plastics are noxious to bacteria used to digest the pollutants and inhibit their ability to properly degrade the target pollutants. More importantly, conventional processes do not remove trace concentrations of emerging contaminants such as PhACs, BPA, PCPs, trichloroethene, neurotoxins, perfluorinated surfactants, and veterinary pharmaceuticals that might be present in actual SWW. Therefore, the combination of conventional wastewater treatment with other technologies, among which AOPs are gaining momentum, is being strongly considered by policy-makers in regulatory agencies as well as decision­makers in different industry sectors to comply with regulatory standards and enhance wastewater treatment processes, especially in the meat processing industry (U.S EPA, 2004; Environment Canada, 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). AOPs are a promising technology used in both water and wastewater treatment processes. It has been shown that photochemical processes are one of the most efficient processes among AOPs to produce OH, which is the most powerful oxidant in the water treatment field. In particular, the vacuum-UV photolysis process is turning into an excellent option to treat wastewater. The many advantages of the VUV process include the production of OH from the homolysis of the water molecule without the addition of auxiliary chemicals, which ideally is the main purpose of purification: removing rather than adding more chemicals. The VUV process does not require monitoring of the residual H2O2 after treatment or the addition of even more chemicals, such as catalase, to remove it.

32

Even though producing VUV radiation is more expensive than UV-C radiation, the lighting industry is developing fast and is producing new lamps, which convert electric energy into VUV at higher efficiency rates, thereby reducing the costs (Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2014; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). Consequently, VUV is becoming one of the outstanding members belonging to the AOPs group, which could produce the coveted ·OH in a simple manner becoming a feasible alternative to UV-C/H2O2. AOPs are being used for the oxidation and degradation of the organic and inorganic materials present in SWW through reactions with hydroxyl radicals (·OH). Benefits of their application include not generating highly toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs) during the disinfection stage, unlike other chemical disinfectants such as chlorine, ozone, chloramines, or chlorine dioxide. As shown in the literature review, DBPs pose an extra risk to public health apart from the compounds being targeted by the process itself. Therefore, the VUV process may be used as a complementary stage to the UV-C/H2O2 in order to reduce the H2O2 requirements. The VUV occurs within 100 to 200 nm range of the electromagnetic spectrum allowing the direct treatment of the organic matter. Furthermore, the characterization of this combined system requires the consideration of cross-factor and single-factor effects using the design of experiments (DOE) to identify those factors that influence the multivariable system. Thus, this study aims to fill the gap in the literature on the application of combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV systems as an alternative to the UV-C/H2O2 photolytic process for the treatment of actual SWW in order to minimize the residual of H2O2 and maximize the overall treatment efficiency (Barrera et al., 2012; BustilloLecompte and Mehrvar, 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016).

CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS

3.1. Introduction This study is focused on determining the performance and the treatment ability of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process for the removal of TOC from actual SWW. Experiments were conducted to assess the efficiencies and performance of the combined process. This chapter presents an overall description of the research approach, materials, and procedures.

3.2. Materials 3.2.1. Actual slaughterhouse wastewater Actual SWW samples were taken from selected provincially licensed meat-processing plants directly from their source in Ontario, Canada, at the time of the study. The actual SWW samples had an average TOC concentration of 800 mg/L. Table 3.1 illustrates overall SWW characteristics from the selected provincially licensed meat processing plants. Distilled water (DW) was used to dilute SWW samples to adjust TOC concentrations for different BBD levels accordingly. A hydrogen peroxide solution (30% w/w) was used.

3.2.2. Experimental setup As shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.2, a laboratoryscale batch recirculation photoreactor setup including two photoreactors in series providing uniform light distribution was used in this study. Each stainless steel photoreactor (SL-LAB 2, Siemens Inc.) had a working volume of 0.46 L with a length of 305 mm, a diameter of 51 mm and annular space of 13.3 mm. UV-C Low-pressure Hg lamp at 14 W and a VUV LP Hg lamps high output at 14 W (LP4130 and LP4135, Siemens Inc.) were used. UV emission peaks were at 254 nm (UV-C 4 W output) and 185 nm (VUV 3.90 W output). A quartz sleeve was used to protect the lamps from a fouling formation that may interfere with the UV radiation emission. This particular geometry (slight annular space) and the method of irradiation lead to having a good approximation of an isoactinic condition (uniform light distribution) in the photoreactor (Ghafoori et al., 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). The total volume of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV system was 1.6 L, including piping and accessories. A magnetic centrifugal pump (Model RK7201210; ColeParmer, Tokyo, Japan) with a maximum capacity of 4.6 GPM and a maximum head of 36.1 ft was used.

The system was also equipped with a by-pass valve to control the flow-rate and provide the relief to the pump pressure. An in-line acrylic flowmeter with a flow-rate range between 50 and 250 mL/min was used to control the wastewater flow rate during the operation. In addition, the system was supplied with a set of valves that allowed using both processes UV-C and VUV individually as well as the two processes combined.

3.3. Experimental procedure Experiments with actual SWW were conducted in a batch recirculation operation. The SWW was exposed to the combined UV/VUV/H2O2 processes for a total of 2.5 h using H2O2 as an oxidant. Furthermore, the following procedure was implemented to carry out each experiment for quality control: 1) The UV lamp was switched on for 30 min before starting each experiment to guarantee light intensity stabilization within the photoreactor. 2) SWW samples were filtered to separate the liquid portion of the wastewater from the solids. 3) Filtered SWW samples were then diluted to reach the desired TOC concentration and guarantee the accuracy of the feed concentration value in a 15 L solution. 4) The SWW solution with the desired TOC concentration was recirculated through the magnetic centrifugal pump to the reactors with a maximum capacity of 4.6 GPM. 5) A portion of recirculating sample was allowed to pass through the flowmeter to the photoreactors. 6) An adequate H2O2 concentration was calculated based on the material balance for each experiment and added to the tank. 7) Samples were taken at 30-minute intervals until the system reached steady state conditions.

38

An experiment without UV irradiation, namely dark experiment, was also conducted to evaluate the possible adsorption of organic compounds on the UV photoreactor walls. SWW samples were taken from the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV system. Volumes of 45 mL were collected from each stage to measure TOC, TN, and residual H2O2. All experiments were repeated in triplicates, and the average values were reported. Furthermore, three replicates were made for each analytical measurement.

3.4. Analytical techniques Different parameters, including TOC, TN and residual H2O2 were measured according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 2012). The details of each analytical technique are explained in the following sections.

3.4.1. Total organic carbon (TOC) TOC concentrations were measured by a Teledyne Tekmar Apollo 9000 Combustion TOC Analyzer equipped with an automated sampler. Before sample analyses, the TOC analyzer was calibrated, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 min (Thermo Scientific Heraeus Multifuge X1). Standards were prepared by adding a carbon source to distilled water to achieve determined levels of carbon. The reagent solutions were prepared as follows: Potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) was used as an organic carbon source for TOC calibration. The KHP was dried in an oven at 105°C for 2 h before the preparation of the stock standard solution and stored in a desiccator. For preparation of a 1,000 mg/L of KHP stock standard solution, 2,125 mg of KHP was dissolved in distilled water and diluted to 1 L.

39

A series of standard solutions, covering the expected range of sample concentrations, (1­ 400 mg/L), was prepared by accurately diluting the 1,000 mg/L of stock standard solution with distilled water. Through running TOC standard calibration analysis, a TOC calibration curve was obtained (Appendix D.9). Thus, TOC removal efficiency was determined by Equation (3.1).

where, TOCo = TOC concentration of initial wastewater sample (mg/L) TOC = TOC concentration of final wastewater sample (mg/L); and TOCrem = TOC removal efficiency (%)

3.4.2. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) A respirometer was used to measure the oxygen uptake of the microorganisms in the SWW media. Respirometric experiments were performed using a BI-2000 electrolytic respirometer (Bioscience Inc., Bethlehem, PA) to observe the biodegradability of the untreated and treated wastewater samples while measuring their BOD5. The respirometer has eight 1-L bioreactor vessels, prepared according to the standard methods (APHA, 2012). According to the instrument manual, each respirometer bioreactor loaded with 10 mL of acclimatized activated sludge, 10 mL of the wastewater sample, and filled up to 1 L with distilled water. The bioreactors require continuous aeration to obtain air saturation conditions and continuous agitation. Respirometer tests were carried out for 240 h (10-days), ultimate BOD (BODU) was measured, at 25°C and with an oxygen generation rate of 75 mg/L. Cumulative

oxygen uptake data recorded every 0.05 h. The data accessed on a computer screen through the instrument software. Two samples of actual SWW, one treated sample by combined UVC/H2O2/VUV processes, and one distilled water (dw) blank were used.

3.5. Experimental design and optimization studies A three-factor along with three-level BBD in conjunction with RSM was used to maximize the TOC removal while minimizing the H2O2 residual. The initial concentration of TOC (X1), the initial concentration of H2O2 (X2), and UV irradiation time (X3), calculated as the exposure time of the actual SWW samples in the photoreactors, were used as independent factors in the DOE. The percent TOC removal (Y1) and the H2O2 residual (Y2) were considered as the process responses. Thus, each factor was coded at three levels (-1, 0, +1) as shown in Table 3.2. Preliminary experiments were used to determine and select the particular ranges of the factors.

A quadratic model was used to estimate the parametric coefficients by correlating dependent and independent variables using the least-squares regression as shown in Equation (3.2) (Ghafoori et al., 2012, 2014, 2015; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016):

Yi   o    i X i    ii X i2    ij X i X j  c
i 1 i 1 i 1 j  2

k 1 k

(3.2)

41

where o, i, ii, and ij are the constant, linear, quadratic, and cross-factor interaction coefficients, respectively; Xi and Xj represent the independent variables; Yi is the predicted response; and k and c are the number of factors of the model and the residual term, respectively. The statistical software Design-Expert 9.0.6.2 was employed for the DOE and the estimation of the coefficients for each response function. The significance of each model equation, individual parameters, and factor interactions were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the confidence intervals of 95% ( = 0.05). Two-dimensional (2D) contour plots and three-dimensional (3D) surface responses were obtained in the quadratic models. Additional experimental runs were carried out to validate the quadratic models for maximum percent TOC removal and minimum H2O2 residual at the optimal operating conditions, calculated by the software numerical optimization method. On the other hand, to obtain a simultaneous objective function that represents the geometric mean of all transformed responses, the desirability multiple response method was used to combine the desirable ranges for each response as shown in Equation (3.3) (Myers et al., 2004):
D  d1  d 2  d 3  d 4   d n 
1n

 n    di    i 1 

1n

(3.3)

where D, di, and n are the desirability objective function, each response range, and the number of responses, respectively. For a simultaneous optimization, each response requires low and high values for the optimization. Otherwise, if any response is found outside of its desirability range, the overall desirability becomes equal to zero. In this case, the percent removal of TOC ( d1) is maximized while the H2O2 residual (d2) is minimized.

42

3.5.1. Box-Behnken design The Box-Behnken design is a creative methodology for three-level designs to fit secondorder response surfaces were developed by Box and Behnken (1960). BBD is based on the construction of balanced incomplete block designs (Error! Reference source not found.). For xample, a balanced incomplete block design with three treatments and three blocks is presented in Table 3.3.

Table 3.3. Balanced incomplete block design example. (Adopted from Ghafoori, 2013) Block number Block 1 Block 2 Block 3 1 X X Treatment 2 X X 3 X X

The pairing of Treatments 1 and 2 indicates that the design variables are paired together in a 22 factorial (scaling ±1) while X3 remains fixed at the centre (X3 = 0). The same applies for Blocks 2 and 3, with a 22 factorial being represented by each pair of treatments while the third factor remains fixed at the centre level. The BBD could be used as an efficient option in terms of number of experiments. The spherical design and the variable combinations at the center and the midpoints of the edges of the variable space make the BBD unique. The BBD involves all edge points, but the entire cube is not covered. There are no points on the corner of the cube or even a distance from the design center (Error! Reference source not found.).

3.5.2. Multiple linear regression In multiple linear regression problems, certain tests of hypotheses about the model parameters are useful in measuring the effectiveness of the model. The most widely used tests are the Fischer's F-value and p-value tests. Generally, Fischer's F-value is used to determine the significance of the regression coefficients of the variables while p-value determines the significance of the variable that may indicate the pattern of interaction among variables. The F-value could be determined by the following equation (Myers et al., 2004):
F MSS Model MSS Error

(3.4) where MSSModel is the mean sum of squares due to the model and MSSError is the mean sum of squares due to error (residuals). The MSSModel and MSSError values are calculated by the following equations:
MSS Model  SS Model df Model SS Error df Error

(3.5)

MSS Error 

(3.6)

where SSModel, SSError, dfModel, and dfError, are the sum of squares of the model, the sum of squares of the residuals, the degrees of freedom for the model, and degree of freedom of the residuals, respectively. The p-values are associated with F-values as they are useful to show whether Fvalues are large enough to indicate the statistical significance. The significance of the regression could be also verified through the coefficient of determination (R2), which is defined as follows:

45

R2 

SS Model SS Error  1 SS Total SS Total

(3.7)

where SSTotal is the total sum of squares calculated by Equation (3.8):
SSTotal  SS Model  SS Error

(3.8)

R2 is the measure of the amount of the reduction in the variability of a response (y) obtained by using the regression variables X1, X2, ..., Xn in the model. However, a value close to 1 does not necessarily indicates a good regression model. Adding a variable to the model always increases the R2, regardless of whether the additional variable is statistically significant or not. Thus, it is possible for models that have large values of R2 to yield poor predictions of new estimates of the mean response. Therefore, it is preferred to use an statistic adjusted R2 given by the following equation (Myers et al., 2004):
2 Radj  1

SS Errorl N  p  N  1 1  R 2  1 N  p  SS Total N  1





(3.9)

where N and p are the number of independent variables and the coefficients, respectively. The R2adj, unlike R2, is not always increased as variables are added to the model. In fact, if unnecessary terms are added, the value of is often decreased. Therefore, high values of R2 and R2adj that are very close to each other imply the significance of the regression.

3.6. Combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV treatment of SWW To evaluate the TOC removal rates achieved the SWW was exposed to the combined processes UV-C/H2O2/VUV. The UV-C photolysis consisted of direct absorption of UV radiation at peak maxima of 254 nm by the target pollutants while VUV consisted of the water photolysis (bond cleavage) to produce OH and oxidize the pollutants present in the water

46

sample. The TOC removal from SWW was studied in a batch recirculation mode for four processes.

47

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1. Introduction Current research on VUV systems as a complementary treatment to the well-established UV-C/H2O2 process have proven the benefits of its application for the treatment of actual SWW. The application of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes maximize the overall treatment efficiency and minimize the residual of H2O2 without application of catalase to decompose the H2O2 into oxygen and water. In this study, the optimum conditions for maximizing the percent TOC removal were determined using a threefactor threelevel BBD combined with the response surface methodology to correlate experimentally obtained data and predicted values. Respirometry assays were also conducted to assess the biodegradability of the actual SWW and the BOD profile before and after the treatment of actual SWW by UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes.

4.2. Preliminary experiments A dark reaction experiment with H2O2 in the absence of UV-C and VUV radiation was conducted to determine the extent of TOC removal achieved by this oxidant alone as well as the possible loss of organic matter through adsorption on the walls of the photoreactor or by volatilization. The actual SWW was pumped into the system with the UV lamps off. The TOC removal rate for the dark experiments with no UV radiation by varying H2O2 concentration (0, 100, 300, 500, and 900 mg/L) was determined to remain constant with maximum variations of up to 2%.

48

Thus, it is confirmed that there is no significant organic matter adsorption to the reactor walls or material losses due to volatilization. Subsequently, any degradation can be attributed to the action of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process itself. The total number of experimental trials was seventeen based on three levels and a threefactor experimental design, with three replicates at the centre of the design, to estimate a pure error sum of squares. The independent variables were initial concentrations of TOC mg/L, H2O2 concentration mg/L and UV irradiation time that were coded as -1, 0, and +1. The independent variables and their critical experimental levels shown in Table 3.2 were selected based on the preliminary experimental results (Figure 4.1). As shown in Figure 4.1a, five initial TOC concentrations (50, 150, 250, 350, 450 mg/L) were used. These initial concentrations were selected based on previous studies for the SWW treatment by UV/H2O2 (Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). It can be observed that as the initial TOC concentration increases, the percent TOC removal decreases. Conversely, the H2O2 residual is minimum at an optimum initial TOC concentration value. Figure 4.1b depicts the influence of the initial H2O2 concentration on the TOC removal and the H2O2 residual. Five H2O2 concentrations (100, 300, 500, 700, and 900 mg/L) were selected and tested based on previous studies (Cao and Mehrvar, 2011; Barrera et al., 2012; Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016; Bustillo-Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015, 2016). Results show that by increasing the H2O2 concentration, the H2O2 residual also increases whereas there is an optimum H2O2 concentration at which percent TOC removal is maximum.

Likewise, Figure 4.1c illustrates the effects of the irradiation time on both the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual. Up to six irradiation times were examined in the range of 2-14 min. Results demonstrate that the TOC removal is directly proportional to the irradiation time while the H2O2 residual is inversely proportional to the irradiation time as established by the profile trends.

Experimental design and statistical analysis Table 4.1 portrays the three-factor, three-level BBD with observed and predicted values for both percent TOC removal and H2O2 residual by the developed quadratic models related to the UVC/H2O2/VUV processes in a batch recirculating photoreactor for actual SWW treatment.

RSM was employed for parameter estimation, indicating the relationship between the input factors and the responses, as shown in Equation (3.2). Thus, to predict the response functions for the percent TOC removal (Y1) and the H2O2 residual (Y2), the following secondorder polynomial equations (Equations (4.1) and (4.2), respectively) were developed in terms of the coded factors.

Negative coefficients for the model components, X1, X2, X2X3, X12, X22, and X32 in Y1 and X1, X3, X1X2, X1X3, and X2X3 in Y2, indicate unfavorable effects on the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively. While, positive coefficients for X3, X1X2, and X1X3 in Y1 and X2, X12, X22, and X32 in Y2 indicate favorable effects on the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively. Coefficients with values close to zero represent lower relative intensity. Thus, X1X2 do not intensely affect the TOC removal while X1X3 do not intensely affect H2O2 residual. Although this evaluation provides a rapid analysis in terms of the parametrical effect on the response variables, the ANOVA with 95% CI was also applied to evaluate the statistical significance of the developed quadratic models for the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual as shown in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, respectively. The statistical significance of each factor coefficient, as shown in Equations (4.1) and (4.2), was determined by the Fisher's (F) exact test, comparing probability (p) values greater than F. As shown in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, the model F-values of 784.87 and 318.01 for TOC removal and H2O2 residual, respectively, imply the models are significant. Besides, small probability
52

values (p < 0.05) indicate significant model terms, which confirm the accuracy of the developed models to predict the response functions. On the other hand, p-values > 0.10 indicate the model terms are not significant. In this case, all model parameters are significant with the exception X1X2 for TOC removal and X1X3 for H2O2 residual. The goodness of fit of the model was validated by the determination coefficient (R2) and the adjusted R2 that ensures an adequate variation of the quadratic model to the experimental values. The values of R2 and adjusted R2 were found to be 0.9990 and 0.9977 for the percent TOC removal and 0.9976 and 0.9944 for the H2O2 residual, respectively. Thus, high R2 and adjusted R2 values represent a high model significance. The closer the values of R2 and adjusted R2 are to one, the better the model prediction is.

Furthermore, the adequate precision of the percent TOC removal and H2O2 residual were found to be 75.272 (Table 4.2) and 50.132 (Table 4.3), respectively. Moreover, the lack of fit was calculated to measure how well the model fits the data. The lack of fit p-values of the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual were found to be 0.4773 (Table 4.2) and 0.3900 (Table 4.3), respectively. An insignificant lack of fit (p > 0.10) is a desirable property because it indicates that the model fits the data well. On the other hand, the assumption of constant variance was verified by plotting the internally studentized residual versus predicted values (Figures 4.2a and 4.3a). The studentized residuals were found by dividing the residuals by their standard deviations. Figures 4.2a and 4.3a also show randomly scattered points within the outlier detection limits ­3 and +3. Therefore,

54

model predictions, described in Equations (4.1) and (4.2), for both the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively, are satisfactory. Moreover, the normal probability plot of residuals, shown in Figures 4.2b and 4.3b for the TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively, showed a straight line pattern followed by the points on the plot, not an S-shaped curve. Consequently, a transformation of the response is not required because of the normal distribution of the residuals (Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). The correlation between observed and predicted values is presented in Figures 4.2c and 4.3c for the TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively. As a result, minor discrepancies are represented by a straight-line trend, which indicates a good agreement between observed and predicted values. Hence, the quadratic model predictions for both the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual responses are satisfactory.

4.4. Individual effect of model parameters Since the significance of the models (Tables 4.2 and 4.3) and the accuracy of the model predictions (Figures 4.2 and 4.3) were confirmed, it was required to examine the significance of each model factor. This evaluation was also performed using the F-exact test and p-values for each factor including linear, quadratic, and cross-factor interaction. As presented in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, pvalues lower than 0.05 indicate the significance of the model coefficients. Therefore, all three independent variables, the initial TOC concentration (X1), the initial H2O2 concentration (X2), and the irradiation time (X3), have significant effect on both responses, the percent TOC removal (Y1) and the H2O2 residual (Y2), based on their p-value.

Figures 4.4a and 4.5a depict the effect of the initial TOC concentration (X1) on the TOC removal (Y1) and the H2O2 residual (Y2), respectively. It can be observed that the initial TOC concentration is inversely proportional to the percent TOC removal, whereas there is an optimum initial TOC concentration at which the H2O2 residual is minimum. Thus, this confirms the results obtained in the preliminary experiments as illustrated in Figure 4.1a. On the other hand, Figures 4.4b and 4.5b illustrate the effect of the initial H2O2 concentration (X2) on the TOC removal (Y1) and the H2O2 residual (Y2), respectively. The predicted models show that there is an optimum H2O2 concentration for a maximum percent TOC removal and a direct relationship between the initial H2O2 concentration and the H2O2 residual, confirming observed values from the preliminary studies as depicted in Figure 4.1b. Similarly, Figures 4.4c and 4.5c show the effect of the irradiation time (X3) on the percent TOC removal (Y1) and the H2O2 residual (Y2), respectively. The predicted models confirm that the percent TOC removal is directly proportional to the irradiation time and that the H2O2 residual is inversely proportional to the irradiation time, as previously shown in Figure 4.1c. The results of the predicted model are in line with the values of the preliminary results, which confirms the accuracy of the predicted model for each parameter.

4.5. Interaction of model parameters, 2D contour plots, and 3D response surface As shown in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, there was only one interaction of model parameters, between influent TOC and H2O2 concentrations (X1X2), which did not indicate a significant effect on the percent TOC removal, despite the fact that it was significant on the H2O2 residual simultaneously. Thus, it can be stated that individual parameters are clearly influencing the trend for the TOC removal as linear effects.

The cross-factor interaction effects between independent variables were plotted on the 3D surfaces and 2D contour plots as shown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7 for the TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively. These figures are the graphical representations of the regression analysis, where the response functions of two factors are presented while all others are at the fixed levels (Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). As shown in Figure 4.6a, the percent TOC removal decreases by increasing the initial TOC concentrations within the factor range. The effect of the initial TOC concentration on the percent TOC removal is essentially attributable to the absorption of the UV-C/VUV radiation by organic compounds along with intermediates formed during the photochemical reactions. Hence, the penetrability of the UV-C/VUV light is reduced at higher TOC concentrations. The light absorption by H2O2 becomes lower, causing a reduced amount of hydroxyl radicals, major contributor to the TOC reduction, which is also confirmed by the trend in Figures 4.6a and 4.7a. Therefore, the interaction effect of the TOC concentration and the H2O2 (X1X2) defines an optimum concentration of the oxidant at a lower initial concentration of the TOC for the maximum TOC removal while generating a minimum H2O2 residual at a lower initial H2O2 concentration with an optimum initial TOC concentration. By augmenting the H2O2 concentration, the percent TOC removal also increases up to an optimum H2O2 concentration. After this point, the trend is reversed due to the excess of H2O2 recombination (Ghafoori et al., 2012, 2014, 2015). The surface plot of the interaction effect of the initial TOC concentration with the irradiation time (X1X3) on TOC removal is similar to that of X1X2 for the same response as confirmed by Figure 4.6b.

63

The 3D plot confirms that the percent TOC removal is inversely proportional to the initial TOC concentration while there is an optimum irradiation time for the maximum TOC removal at which the effect of further irradiation is negative due to the scavenging effect of the hydroxyl radicals (Bustillo-Lecompte et al., 2016). In the case of the X1X3 interaction effect on the H2O2 residual, the minimum H2O2 residual is obtained at an optimum point near the maximum irradiation time of the studied range with an optimum initial TOC concentration (

64

Figure 4.7b). Lastly, the cross-factor interaction between the initial H2O2 concentration and the irradiation time (X2X3) shown in Figure 4.6c shows an optimum point at which both factors interact where an optimum initial H2O2 concentration with a maximum irradiation time generate the maximum removal of TOC. In the case of the X2X3 interaction effect on H2O2 residual, the minimum H2O2 residual is achieved at the lower initial H2O2 concentration and a maximum irradiation time (

65

Figure 4.7c).

4.6. Optimization of operating conditions and process parameters RSM was used to obtain the optimum experimental conditions of the three independent variables, including the initial TOC concentration (X1), the initial H2O2 concentration (X2), and the irradiation time (X3) to obtain maximum percent TOC removal and minimum H2O2 residual using the numerical optimization method built into the statistical software Design-Expert 9.0.6.2. Equations (4.1) and (4.2) were defined as objective functions for the percent TOC removal and the H2O2 residual, respectively, and the independent factors in their critical range

66

were used as constraints. The numerical optimization method explores the design space using the developed models to find the optimum factor conditions. The multiple response approach (Equation 3.3) was used to obtain the desirability 3D response surface (Figure 4.8) by maximizing the percent removal of TOC (d1) and minimizing the H2O2 residual (d2) at optimum factor settings. Thus, the optimum conditions to achieve the maximum TOC removal of 46.19% and minimum H2O2 residual of 1.05% when treating actual SWW were: initial TOC concentration of 213.01 mg/L, initial H2O2 concentration of 450.71 mg/L, and irradiation time of 9.06 min. The obtained optimal operating conditions were tested in another experimental run to validate the predicted values. Thus, a TOC removal of 45.68% and H2O2 residual of 1.03% were obtained experimentally, confirming the reliability of the model since they are both between the 95% CI of 43.98­49.82% for TOC removal and 0.16­2.13% for H2O2 residual. These results are promising for the application of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV system as a post-treatment method after biological treatment of a high strength actual SWW.

4.7. Comparison between combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes and individual processes Three individual processes, VUV alone, VUV/H2O2, and UV-C/H2O2, were evaluated to compare their performance for the treatment of actual SWW using the optimum parameters obtained in combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes. Figure 4.9 shows the comparison of all individual and combined processes using an initial TOC concentration of 213.01 mg/L, initial H2O2 concentration of 450.71 mg/L (excepting VUV alone), and irradiation time of 9.06 min. Results show that VUV alone have a maximum TOC removal of 39.93% compared to the 41.77% obtained by UV-C/H2O2 alone. Therefore, by adding

67

the H2O2 as an auxiliary component to the VUV treatment is possible to increase its efficiency to 43.62%.

Similarly, Figure 4.9 depicts the performance of each treatment process on the H2O2 residual. In the UV-C/H2O2 process, the H2O2 was measured as 6.69% while in the VUV/H2O2 a 4.88% was obtained. These results confirm that an adequate combination of the UVC/H2O2/VUV processes is essential for an optimized TOC removal and H2O2 residual.

4.8. Biodegradability of the actual SWW using Respirometry assays Respirometry analyses were also performed to evaluate the biodegradability of the SWW and the BOD removal efficiency of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes. Samples of actual SWW, treated SWW by combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV process, and a black were evaluated as shown in Figure 4.10. The initial TOC concentration was set at 450 mg/L, the highest level of the initial TOC concentration used for the preliminary studies (Figure 4.1). The BOD5 was obtained as the oxygen uptake at five days for each sample. Therefore, the BOD5 concentration of the actual untreated SWW was found to be 493 mg/L as shown in Figure 4.10. Then, the COD was estimated based on the TOC correlation with COD (Ford et al., 1971). Thus, an industrial effluent with 450 mgTOC/L has an equivalent of 1,400 mgCOD/L. In contrast, the BOD after ten days was found to be 688 mg/L using respirometry assays (Figure 4.10). Consequently, the BOD/COD ratio was calculated to be 0.50, which indicates that the actual SWW is considered to be biodegradable. Figure 4.10 also illustrates the BOD5 concentrations in the treated SWW by the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes to be 189 mg/L, respectively. Thus, the BOD/COD ratio of 0.14 for the treated effluent. The SWW treated effluent becomes less biodegradable since it has already been widely degraded. Therefore, this method is recommended as post-treatment of the SWW.

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1. Conclusions The following conclusions are drawn from this thesis:  A threefactor Box­Behnken statistical experiment design applied in this study was found to be an appropriate response surface methodology to determine the effects of process parameters on the response functions in the studied range, and results in the treatment of actual slaughterhouse wastewater by UV-C/H2O2/VUV process in a batch recirculating photoreactor were reliable. The accuracy of the developed quadratic models was evaluated using analysis of variance.  Results demonstrated that the initial concentrations of total organic carbon, H2O2 and the irradiation time have considerable effect on the total organic carbon removal and the H2O2 residual. The interaction between process parameters are different, for instance, the initial concentrations of total organic carbon and H2O2 (X1X2) did not indicate a significant impact on the total organic carbon removal while being significant on the H2O2 residual. Whereas, the initial concentrations of total organic carbon and irradiation time (X1X3) did not indicate a significant impact on the H2O2 residual while being significant on the total organic carbon removal.  A maximum total organic carbon removal of 45.68% and minimum H2O2 residual of less than 1.03% were found at the optimum operating conditions of 213 mg/L initial

73

concentration of total organic carbon, 450 mg/L initial H2O2 concentration, and 9 min irradiation time.  The developed mathematical models provided a detailed exploration of the simultaneous cross-factor interactive effects of the independent variables on the responses. Thus, the proposed models explaining the photochemical treatment of actual slaughterhouse wastewater by the continuous UV-C/H2O2/VUV photoreactor could be used as a base for future studies on process optimization, photoreactor design, modeling, and scale-up.  Respirometry analyzes revealed that the SWW treated effluent becomes less biodegradable (BOD/COD ratio of 0.14) since it has already been widely degraded. Therefore, this method is recommended as post-treatment of the actual SWW.  Actual SWW samples were used in this study to evaluate the accurate performance of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV system under real conditions, which will permit further studies on kinetics modeling, scale-up, and cost-effectiveness analysis. However, due to the wide range of the actual SWW concentrations, biological treatment must be considered prior to the use of the UV-C/H2O2/VUV system, especially at TOC concentrations higher than 350 mg/L.  Furthermore, primary treatment by storage, DAF, or land application, are the current technologies used in most slaughterhouses in Ontario, where only the large particles, such as solids, feathers, skin, grease, etc., are removed. Therefore, considering the integration of biological treatment and AOPs could be an on-site secondary and tertiary treatment to prevent inadequate discharge of the SWW to water bodies or groundwater, which is detrimental to the environment.

74

5.2. Recommendations The following recommendations are suggested for further research on actual SWW treatment:



Further study should be focused on continuous mode to determine the interaction of process parameters and efficiency in TOC removal and reduction of H2O2 residual.



Further work should be conducted the combination of biological processes with UV/VUV/H2O2 as a post-treatment method for cost-effective analysis.



Further research is suggested by using four factor and four level BBD experimental design using Initial TOC, and H2O2 concentrations along with irradiation time and pH considered as process parameters to evaluate a possible optimization in terms of TOC removal and H2O2 residual percentage.



Further research should be also considered the examination of emerging contaminants present in actual SWW, including pharmaceutical compounds used by veterinary physicians, antiinflammatories, cleaning products, endocrine disruptors, and possible hazardous compounds, which are being discharged without proper treatment, particularly in the livestock farming.



Further work may be considered the additional investigation of kinetic modeling, optimization of processes, and modeling of the combined UV-C/H2O2/VUV processes, as well as the analysis of different intermediates that may be formed during the UVC/H2O2/VUV treatment.

Appendix A. Sample standard deviation Each experiment in the present work was replicated three times, and the reported results represent the average value of the collected results. Error bars depicted in the figures represent the sample standard deviation (SD), which was used to analyze the accuracy of an experimental measurement for a finite set of experimental data. The SD was calculated as follows.

2  = -1  =1( -  )

1

(A.1)

where, i = observed values of the sample items (1, 2, ..., n);  = mean value of the sample observations; and N = sample size.

79

Appendix B. Relative error analysis Relative error was used to express an accuracy of an acceptable value of the quantity being measured. The relative error could be positive, negative or zero indicating that the measured value is smaller than, greater than, or equal to the mean of a set of data. The lowest average absolute error was used as a criterion for the optimization of the total electricity costs and reaction time. The relative error can be obtained by Equation (D.2) as shown below.

  = where,

-  

 100%

(A.2)

 = accepted value; and  = mean of a finite set of data.

The non-linear least square function was used to determine the best-fit criterion, which involves two sets of data are the closest to each other as expressed in Equation (D.3).
