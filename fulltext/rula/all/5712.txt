Abstract
Observations of the Economic Production Quantity Model with Imperfect Quality Items with/without Inspection Author: Yu Wei

Master of Engineering in the Program of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Ryerson University, 2016

Three observations of the economic production quantity model with imperfect quality items with/without inspection are presented in this report. Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008) models do not meet their expected objective functions. The first observation tries to clarify the relationships among their expected objective functions and the actual ones through the derivation, the numerical simulation and statistical comparison. This report concludes s that both models are not very accurate, but capable. Khan et al. (2011) and Khan et al. (2014) ignored the independent condition of properties of the expectation of random variables, which resulted in minor errors in both papers. The second and the third observations are the corrections of the models of two papers, respectively. Numerical comparisons show the differences between the original models and the revisions are minor, but significant. An example of a multi-factor sensitivity analysis is shown in this report.

Chapter 1 Introduction
The assumptions of the traditional EPQ/EOQ model are rigorous. Salameh and Jaber (2000) extend the traditional EPQ/EOQ model by taking imperfect quality items into account. Maddah and Jaber (2008) mention that there is a flaw in the method of evaluating the expected profit per unit of time,  [], in Salameh and Jaber (2000). Maddah and Jaber (2008) argue that the approach in modelling of the  [] in Salameh and Jaber (2000) is not accurate since they did not use the The work of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008)

received considerable attention by several researchers, such as VÃ¶rÃ¶s (2013), Khan et al. (2011), Khan et al. (2014), Zhou et al. (2016), and Rezaei (2016), to name some. This report shows that the two models are not the exact expression of  [], per unit of time, , needs to be classified, and it is meaningful to discuss how the

but rather approximate the expressions of  []. The definition of the total profit objective functions of the two models relate.

Khan et al. (2011) extend the EOQ model by considering items of imperfect quality and inspection errors. Khan et al. (2014) established a model for an integrated supply chain taking quality inspection and learning in production into consideration. Both studies apply the same method provided in Maddah and Jaber (2008). A wide attention has been given to both papers by Khan et al. (e.g., Chang et al. (2016), Azadeh et al. (2016), and Hou et al. (2015)). Khan et al. (2011, 2014) neglect the independence of random variables, (for example, the cycle length  =
(1- )(1-1 ) 

is relevant to the percentage of defective

1

items ) when the properties of the expectation of random variables are applied, which results in minor errors. So, the two models need to be revised. There are three observations in this report. In Chapter 2, a comparison of the models, Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008), is presented. The definition of the total profit per unit time, , the relationship among expected discussed, and a numerical comparison is provided. In Chapter 3, the model of Khan

Examples of a multi-factor sensitivity analysis are also provided. In Chapter 4, the model of Khan et al. (2014) is reviewed and corrected. The results of the revised model are compared with those of Khan et al. (2014). A conclusion is given in Chapter 5.

Chapter 2 Observation 1-- Comparison of the Models Between Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008)
2.1 Introduction
This section provides a brief review of the models of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008), then defines the total profit per unit time, . This chapter concludes with a remark on the two models. 2.1.1 Review of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008)

The following notation are used in both Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008).    demand rate order size unit variable cost fixed cost of placing an order percentage of defective items in  (probability that an item is defective), a random variable probability density function of

()

total profit per unit time in a finite time 

Salameh and Jaber (2000) assume that: (1) defective items are sold as a single batch at a discounted price; (2) a 100% percent screening process of the lot is conducted at a rate of  units per unit of time; and (3) items of poor quality are kept

in stock and sold prior to receiving the next shipment (by the end of the screening period) as a single batch at a discounted price of  per unit. The profit per cycle is given by Salameh and Jaber (2000) as () = (1 - ) +  -  -  -  -    = (1 - )  [(1 - ]2  2 +  2 

(2.1)

the cycle length is

(2.2)

From Eq. (2.1) and Eq. (2.2), the profit per unit of time is given as () = ()/

(2.3)

Eq. (2.3) can be written as    1 () =   -  +   +   - -  -  -  Ã    1 -  - (1 - ) 2

(2.4)

So, the expected profit per unit of time is derived in Salameh and Jaber (2000) as  [()] =  [ () ] 

(2.5)

, which becomes

    [()] =   -  +   +   - -  -  -     Ã   1 (1 -  []) - 1 -  2 (2.6)

The optimal order quality that maximizes Eq. (2.6) is given in Salameh and Jaber (2000) as
  =

Note: There is a typographical error in the expression of the optimal order quality of Salameh and Jaber (2000), which is corrected by Cardenas-Barron (2000). The "2" in the denominator is missing in Salameh and Jaber (2000). CardenasBarron (2000) conclud that this error does not affect the behavior of the model nor the results. Maddah and Jaber (2008) mention that there is a flaw in Eq. (2.5) of Salameh and Jaber (2000), which is not accurate (see, for example, Wolff (1989), p. 60). The authors derive the expected profit per unit time by applying renewal-reward theorem as  [()] =  [()]  []

2 [1/(1 - )] [1 -  [] - 2(1 -  [1/(1 - )])/]

(2.7)

(2.8)

Then, the optimal order quantity is obtained by differentiating the expression of  [()] which

2 [ [(1 - )2 ] + 2 [] /]

(2.9)

2.1.2 The Definition of  For a finite time ,  = =1  only when the last cycle is completed. When
() ()

the last cycle is not completed,   =1  . So () = () ()   

Then Eq. (2.5) is not accurate, i.e. ()  [()]     

when the last cycle is not completed. The definition of  is given below: time in a finite time  , () is given as
() =1 () =1

1) If the reward is collected at the end of each cycle, the total profit per unit

() 1 1 () = =   =       
()+1 =1 ()+1 =1

(2.10)

2) If the reward is collected at the beginning of each cycle, then (2.11)

() 1 1 () = =   =       
() =1 ( )

3) If the reward is uniformly collected over a cycle,

  +1  -  () 1 () = =    + ()+1  =1    ()+1

(2.12)

2.1.3 Remark on the Models of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008) The renewal-reward theorem is a limit theorem instead of an accurate one (please refer to in Ross (1996), P.133 or Wolff (1988), P. 59). Because of this fact, and the models of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008) only consider one order cycle instead of all cycles, the models of both papers become approximations of the true function. So, to be more accurate, the objective function of the model of Salameh and Jaber (2000) should be written as  [ ] =

 [ / ] instead of  [], where  is the index of ith cycle. Similarly, the So, the relations among  [],  [ ] and
 [ ] [ ]

objective function of Maddah and Jaber (2008) should be written as  [ ]/ [ ]. are discussed next.

  compares ( ) of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and   of Maddah

and Jaber (2008), respectively.

In step 5, one sample t-test is chosen because it is a one mean test for a large

sample size (Thank to the central limit theorem (CLM)) with an unknown variance. The approach of the t-test is introduced below: 1) If a random sample of size : 1 , 2 ,  ,  2) 0 :  [] =  = 0  :  [] =   0

Chapter 3 Observation 2-- A Note on Khan et al. (2011)
In this chapter, a minor error in Khan et al. (2011) is identified. A revised model is presented and numerically compared to the model of Khan et al. (2011). A multi-factor sensitivity analysis is also provided. The different parts of the two models are labeled in boldfaced characters.

3.1 Introduction
3.1.1 Review of Khan et al. (2011) Khan et al. (2011) extended the model of Salameh and Jaber (2000) by considering inspection errors. A mathematical model with closed form solution is developed. Numerical examples were also provided to illustrate the solution procedure. A similar modelling approach to Maddah and Jaber (2008) was used, i.e. renewal-reward theorem. Apart from the same notation in Salameh and Jaber (2000), the other notations in this paper are presented below:

1 2 (1 ) 1

probability of Type I error (classifying a non-defective item as defective), a random variable probability of Type II error (classifying a defective item as nondefective), a random variable probability density function of 1 inspection time in a cycle

(2 ) 2

probability density function of 2 the remaining time in a cycle, after the defective items are screened

out 1 2     number of items that are classified as defective in one cycle ), a random variable number of defective items that are returned from the market in one cycle), a random variable cost of accepting a defective item cost of rejecting a non-defective item cycle length(  =
(1- )(1-1 ) 

), a random variable

a parameter used for simplifying the holding cost, a random variable, where  = 1 - / - (1 + ) + (1 + 2 )

There are three assumptions in the paper: 1) The probability of misclassification errors is known. 2) The items that are returned from the market are stored with those that are classified as defective by the inspector. They are all sold as a single batch at the end of each cycle at a discounted price. 3) The number of non-defective items is at least equal to the adjusted demand. The authors established the model as follows: Total profit per cycle ()= total revenue per cycle Â­ total cost per cycle

= (the revenue from selling the good items + the salvage of items that are

classified as defective items + the salvage of defective items that are returned from the market) Â­ (the procurement cost + the screening cost, which is the sum of the costs of (a) inspection and (b) misclassification + the holding cost, which include the costs of (a) non-defective lot, (b) defective lot and (c) returned lot)

There is a need to pay attention to the calculation of  [2 ] for the same reason The items returned from the market that are defective items sell for a unit for

Proposition 2.3, in Ross (2009), P.49. So, the expressions of  [()] and   in Khan et al., (2011) need to be re-derived.

3.2 Revised Model

According to Teng et al. (2013) the total revenue should be rewritten as  = (1 - )(1 - 1 ) + (1 - )1 + 2 + (1 - 2 ) So, the total profit per cycle should be rewritten as () = (1 - )(1 - 1 ) + (1 - )1 +  -[ +  +  +  (1 - )1 +  2  2  2 2 +  - 2 +   + 2  2

The expected cycle length is  [] =

So the expected annual profit or the expected profit per unit time would be  [()] = or

 []  [1 ] + (1 -  [1 ]) (1 -  [])(1 -  [1 ])

The first derivative of equation (3.10) is

  2   [2 ] +  - +    2 2   2 (1 -  [])(1 -  [1 ])

To be comparable, the total profit expression used in Khan et al (2011) is chosen, i.e. Eq. (3.1). A Matlab program, which is provided in Appendix 3, has the following steps:
 Step 1: Calculate the optimal order size  (2011) by using Eq. (3.6).

  4 : (2011) (  (2011) )  (2011) (  )

 Step 2: Calculate the optimal order size   by using Eq. (3.11).

3.3.4 Sensitivity Analysis Since the difference between the revised model and the model of Khan et al (2011) is very small, there is no need to redo a one-factor sensitivity analysis since it has been done by Khan et al (2011). However, if there are several factors that change simultaneously, then performing one-factor sensitivity analysis may not be accurate because of possible interaction effect between/among the factors. Khan et al (2011) have analyzed the relationship between the expected annual profit and the fraction of defectives  [ ] by fixing the order size per cycle , , , 1 , 2 ,etc., but a complicated function including multiple terms, interaction

 at 1439. Since the expected annual profit  [] is not a linear function of  [ ]

of factors on the expected annual profit  [] may occur. What would happen if the order size per cycle  is adjusted at the same time?

An example of two factors changing at the same time is shown in Figure 1.

The relationship between the expected annual profit  [] and the expected fraction of defectives  [] is explained in two cases:
31

Case 1: The expected annual profit  [] is calculated by fixing the order

size per cycle  at 1454, which is the optimal order size per cycle * of  [] = 0.02 with the other parameters as given in Section 3.3.2. For this case, only one factor, the fraction of defectives  [ ], is changed.

Figure 2 The difference of expected annual profits  [( = 1454)] and

A base comparison is provided where  [] = 1094046.21 ,  [] = 0.02 ,  = 50,000 ,and  = 1454. The other parameters are as given in Section 3.3.2. jointly changing three factors at the same time is 91204.72 - [-16864.79 + 109754.23 + (-32.55)] The difference of the cumulative effects of changing one factor at a time and

The results in Table 8 show that it is more meaningful to perform a multifactor sensitivity analysis. For the example in Table 8, the expression of  [] is known. So, the

interaction effect can be judged by its expression. If the exact expression is not known, a uniform experimental design and a regression model of the experimental results might be helpful (please refer to Li (2000) on this point).

Chapter 4 Observation 3-- A Note on Khan et al. (2014)
Khan et al. (2014) contains similar errors as those found in Khan et al. (2011). In this chapter, the revised models are numerically compared to the model of Khan et al. (2014). For clarity, corrected/modified mathematical terms of the models are labeled in boldfaced characters.

4.1.1 The Base Model

4.1.2 The Model with Inspection Errors

If taking inspection errors into consideration, the fraction of defective item and its expected value as a result of imperfect inspection is given by Khan et al. (2014) as  = (1 -  )1 + (1 - 2 )  [ ] = (1 -  []) [1 ] +  [ ](1 -  [2 ])

and

The expected time interval between successive shipments is  [] = (1 -  [ ]) { [ ][1 ] + (1 -  [ ])(1 -  [2 ])} =    ( +  )    +  +  +  +  (1 -  [ ]) (1 -  [ ])  

The expected total annual cost is written as  [(, )] = +

+  ( - [ ]) + +

    ( - 1) - ( - 2)  2 (1 -  [ ]) 

Similarly, 1 =  [ ] and 2 = 1/(1 -  [ ])

4.1.3 The Model with Learning in Production

When taking learning in production into consideration, the total cost of the two-level supply chain in Khan et al. (2014) is  (, ) = 

  2- + [{1 + ( - 1)}1- - {( - 1)}1- ] (1 )  -  - 2- {1- - ( - 1)1- }  ( - 1) 2 + 2 -  2

(4.10)

Using  [] as the total cycle time, the expected annual cost, by using the renewalreward theory as in Maddah and Jaber (2008), would be  [(, )] = = + +  (, )  []

The difference between the revised model and Khan et al. (2014) is  [(1 -  )2 ]  (1 -  [ ]) (1 -  [ ])

  2  [ ]  ( - 1) - ( - 2)  +   2(1 -  [ ])

The expected annual cost can also be rewritten as

The second derivative of Eq. (4.11) is the same as Khan et al. (2014). So, the optimal size of a shipment from the vendor to buyer   and the number of shipments per cycle  can be obtained by using the same method described in Khan et al.

So, the revised model is different from the model of Khan et al. (2014). Let 1 =  [ ] , 2 = 1/(1 -  [ ]), and  = [( -  ) ], then  [(, )] = +    2 ( - 1) - ( - 2)  2  2 ( +  )   +  + 2  +  +

The second derivative of Eq. (4.14) is the same as in Khan et al. (2014). So, the optimal size of a shipment from the vendor to buyer   and the number of shipments (2014). per cycle  can be obtained by using the same method described in Khan et al.

 [2 ] =0.02 .Table 10 shows the following results:  [ ] = 0.2,  [1 ] =0.2, and

et al. (2014), which are summarized below: Scenario 1: a base model where there are no inspection errors and learning in production. Scenario 2: the errors in inspection are involved, whereas there is no learning in production. Scenario 3: learning in production is considered while inspection errors are assumed to be negligible. Scenario 4: both inspection errors and learning in production are considered.

It can be seen that the differences of the two models are not that significant, but they are increased when the volatility is increased.

It is worth mentioning that the costs of misclassification errors are not included in the Eq. (4.8). If both inspection errors and learning in production are considered, i.e. Scenario 4 in Khan et al. (2014), the expected annual cost is  [ (, )] = + 2 ( +  )  1 2  +  + ( + )2 +

Chapter 5 Conclusion

In conclusion, this report presents three observations of the economic production quantity model with imperfect quality items with/without inspection. The remarks and comparisons of the models of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008) are presented in the first observation. In this observation, the definition of the total profit per unit time in a finite time , ()

is emphasized. The relationships of the objective functions of Salameh and Jaber (2000) and Maddah and Jaber (2008), and the expected total profit per unit time,

 [] are identified. It is concluded that both models are not very accurate, but The results show that the model of Maddah and Jaber (2008) is more accurate when the volatility of the percentage of defective items  is small, which is more practical in reality.

capable through the derivation, the numerical simulation and statistical comparison.

In the second observation, a minor error in Khan et al. (2011) is first identified. Then, the revised model and numerical comparison are provided. The expression of the total profit per cycle is modified according to Teng et al. (2013). The condition of the properties of the expectation of random variables, i.e. the independence of random variables, is emphasized in the revised model. Numerical analysis shows that the difference of the optimal lot size   between the models of

Khan et al. (2011) and revised model increases when the volatility of the percentage

of defective items  increases. The same pattern is shown on the expected total profit per unit of time,  , of Khan et al. (2011) respectively, the numerical
53
  profit per unit of time  []. By substituting  (2011) and  into the total

comparison shows that the differences are minor but significant, which means that the differences are systematic. The results of a multi-factor sensitivity analysis have been presented. When several factors are changed simultaneously, performing a multi-factor sensitivity analysis may be more accurate than performing one-factor sensitivity analysis because of possible interaction effect between/among the factors. The same errors that were identified in Khan et al. (2011) are found in Khan et al. (2014). So, the third observation is the correction of the models of Khan et al. (2014). Numerical comparison shows that the differences of the two models are not that significant, but they are increased when the volatility is increased.
