Abstract  
Truck  Escape  Ramp  Analysis   Master  of  Engineering,  2016   Kaitlyn  Ann  Greto   Yeates  School  of  Graduate  Studies,  Civil  Engineering   Ryerson  University   The  truck  escape  ramp  design  presented  by  the  Transportation  Association  of  Canada  is  based   on   deterministic   values   of   the   design   variables   which   include   the   required   stopping   distance,   design  speed,  rolling  resistance,  and  grade.  Currently,  a  reliability  analysis  of  the  design  of  truck   escape  ramps  does  not  exist.  This  report  presents  two  methods  used  to  analyze  the  reliability  of   truck  escape  ramp  design;  the  first  order  second  moment  reliability  method  and  the  advanced   first   order   second   moment   reliability   method.   These   methods   do   not   rely   on   deterministic   values   rather   the   mean   and   variance   (moments)   of   each   random   variable's   probability   distribution.   Each   reliability   method   was   used   to   analyze   truck   escape   ramps   with   one   grade   and  two  grades,  for  a  total  of  four  cases.  The  results  of  each  case  are  provided  and  discussed   along   with   an   application   to   two   existing   truck   escape   ramps.   The   results   show   that   the   advanced  first  order  second  moment  reliability  method  ensures  more  accurate  results  as  well   as  a  larger  safety  margin  in  comparison  to  the  first  order  second  moment  method  due  to  the   nature  of  the  methodology  itself  which  considers  design  points.

Introduction  

A   truck   escape   ramp   is   a   type   of   auxiliary   lane   used   in   extreme   circumstances   and   as   a   final   resort  by  runaway  vehicles  that  are  out  of  control.  Truck  escape  ramps  are  designed  based  on   their  capacity  to  stop  a  runaway  vehicle  and  are  implemented  to  increase  roadway  safety.  The   design   of   truck   escape   ramps   depends   on   several   factors   including   the   speed   the   runaway   vehicle  enters  the  truck  escape  ramp,  rolling  resistance,  and  the  truck  escape  ramp  grade.     Current   research   does   not   contain   a   reliability   analysis   on   the   design   of   truck   escape   ramps.   Therefore,  the  focus  of  this  report  is  to  develop  a  reliability  model  for  various  scenarios  in  order   to   establish   a   design   that   ensures   safety   and   evades   failure.   In   this   report,   two   reliability   methods   are   developed   which   examine   and   analyze   various   truck   escape   ramp   designs.   The   methods   include   a   first   order   second   moment   reliability   method   and   an   advanced   first   order   second   moment   reliability   method.   These   methods   were   selected   as   they   are   analytical   methods   and   are   simpler   to   use   than   other   methods   such   as   Monte   Carlo   simulation.   The   purpose  of  developing  these  methods  is  to  limit  the  probability  of  failure  of  a  truck  escape  ramp   in  order  to  enhance  roadway  safety.     These  models  were  then  applied  to  two  existing  truck  escape  ramps  to  assess  the  reliability  of   the   design   of   the   existing   truck   escape   ramps.   The   results   of   the   analysis   are   reported   along   with  a  brief  discussion  and  comparison.           1

Background  

A   truck   escape   ramp   (TER),   otherwise   known   as   a   runaway   truck   ramp   or   emergency   escape   ramp,   is   a   type   of   auxiliary   lane   implemented   adjacent   to   roadways   with   a   steep,   sustained   grade,  to  increase  roadway  safety  and  avoid  potential  fatal  crashes  [1].

The   name   of   the   system   comes   from   the   purpose   and   function   of   the   system   which   is   to   divert   and  stop  runaway  trucks,  buses  and/or  other  vehicles  which  are  out  of  control  due  to  reasons   such   as   a   failed   brake   system.   It   is   in   these   cases   where   methods   to   slow   down   the   runaway   vehicle,   such   as   shifting   down   gears   or   applying   the   brakes,   are   not   sufficient   to   stop   the   uncontrollable  vehicle.  When  a  vehicle  enters  the  TER  system  at  high  speeds,  the  great  amount   of   energy   is   dissipated   through   rolling   resistance   and/or   gravitational   deceleration.   Thus,   the   design   of   a   TER   is   based   on   the   type   of   surfacing   material   used,   the   speed   of   the   runaway

vehicle   entering   the   TER,   and   the   percent   grade   of   the   TER   [3].   The   implementation   of   TERs   therefore  results  in  lower  vehicular  damage  and  reduced  collision  injury.

Warrants:  Best  Practices  

The  principal  demands  for  TERs  are  traffic  safety,  safe  exit  and  stop  of  a  runaway  vehicle,  and   protection   of   residences   or   alternate   activities   operating   along   the   highway   or   at   the   base   of   the  roadway  grade.  According  to  the  Transportation  Association  of  Canada's  Geometric  Design   Guide   for   Canadian   Roads   (TAC   Guide),   a   uniformly   accepted   practice   to   warrant   a   TER   or   establish  a  TER  location  does  not  exist.  Each  individual  scenario  involves  unique  variables  which   require  independent  means  of  determining  if  a  TER  is  warrantable  and  where  the  TER  should  be   located.   As   a   result,   each   location   should   be   evaluated   using   a   benefit   cost   analysis   and   engineering  judgement  with  strong  consideration  for  user  safety  [3].   While   considering   the   above,   TERs   are   typically   warrantable   where   continuous   steep   downgrades  exist  in  either  rural  or  urban  areas,  or  where  short  steep  downgrades  exist  with  a   6  

  

  

residential   or   urban   area   along   the   highway   or   at   the   base   of   the   downgrade   [1,   3].   This   can   include   mountainous   regions,   such   as   in   the   State   of   California,   where   small   residential   areas   exist.   It  is  these  areas  in  which  various  factors  such  as  increased  truck  weight,  traffic  volume,   and   speed   result   in   an   increased   number   of   runaway   vehicles   [5].   Collision   data,   such   as   number  of  fatal  crashes,  in  combination  with  terrain  evaluation,  can  also  bring  attention  to  a   specific  location  in  need  of  a  TER.   Another  way  to  determine  the  need  and  specific  location  for  a  TER  is  using  the   Grade  Severity   Rating   System   which   uses   vehicle   weight   and   a   preset   brake   temperature   limit,   for   example   260°C,  to  determine  a  maximum  safe  descent  speed.  The  TAC  Guide  defines  a  maximum  safe   descent  speed  as  "that  speed  from  which  an  emergency  vehicle  stop  at  the  bottom  of  the  grade   will  not  generate  brake  temperatures  above  a  pre-selected  temperature  limit"  [3].  In  scenarios   where  the  brake  temperature  exceeds  the  preset  limit,  the  system  determines  this  scenario  as   brake   failure,   and   a   potential   location   where   a   TER   can   be   implemented.   Since   this   system   only   analyzes  the  roadway  grade  and  not  the  horizontal  alignment,  it  cannot  be  used  alone  and  must   be  used  in  conjunction  with  other  determining  factors  prior  to  rejecting  the  implementation  of   a  TER.   Aside   from   the   geometric   design   of   a   roadway,   other   factors   must   be   considered   when   determining  the  need  for  a  TER.  For  instance,  many  truck  drivers  are  from  out-of-area  and  are   unfamiliar   with   maneuvering   various   terrain.   For   example,   65%   of   the   total   number   of   truck   drivers   within   the   State   of   California   are   out-of-state   trucks   whose   drivers   are   not   familiar   with  

7  

  

  

maneuvering  through  the  mountainous  terrain  [5].  In  this  case  driver  unfamiliarity  could  initiate   the  need  for  TERs.     Another  example  is  low  truck  maintenance  in  order  to  reduce  company  overhead  costs  [5].  This   poses   a   serious   threat   to   highway   safety   due   to   overloaded   trucks,   and   as   a   result,   failed   brake   systems.     It   is   these   situations   where   TERs   should   be   considered   for   implementation.   These   factors,   amongst   others,   initiate   the   need   for   the   design   and   implementation   of   TERs   in   order   to   maintain  control  of  runaway  vehicles  and  prevent  serious,  and  potentially  fatal,  collisions.  The   implementation   of   TERs   will   thus   increase   the   safety   of   all   road   users,   truck   drivers,   and   roadside  properties.

Similar  to  TER  warrants,  specific  criteria  or  guidelines  for  a  singly  defined  TER  location  do  not   exist  [3].  Although  each  scenario  is  unique,  choosing  an  appropriate  location  is  critical.     According   to   the   TAC   Guide,   the   main   factors   considered   when  determining   the   location   of   a   TER  include  alignment  and  terrain.  More  specifically:  grade,  topography,  horizontal  alignment,   location   of   collisions,   length   of   grade,   speed   of   the   out-of-control   vehicle(s),   the   condition   at   the  bottom  of  the  grade,  distance  below  the  summit,  and  the  available  space  adjacent  to  the   highway  and  the  environmental  impact  [3].           8  

  

  

Furthermore,  some  best  practices  when  locating  the  TER  include  [3]:     1.   Locate  the  TER  such  that  it  intercepts  the  largest  number  of  runaway  vehicles.  This  can   be  achieved  by  locating  the  TER  at  the  bottom  of  the  highway's  grade,  at  intermediate   points   along   the   highway   grade,   or   at   a   location   where   the   runaway   vehicle(s)   may   cause  disastrous  results.  In  this  case,  collision  data  is  very  important.   2.   Locate  the  TER  where  "brake  fade"  may  begin.   3.   Locate   the   TER   prior   to   specific   accident-prone   locations   along   the   highway.   For   example,  areas  which  cannot  be  safely  navigated  due  a  sharp  vertical  curve.   4.   Locate  the  TER  on  a  horizontal  tangent  or  locations  with  very  flat  curvature.   5.   Ideally,   and   in   terms   of   driver   expectation,   locate   the   TER   on   the   right   side   of   the   highway.   In   cases   where   this   is   not   possible,   locate   the   TER   on   the   left   side   where   there   is  a  wide  median.   If  there  is  more  than  one  warrantable  location  along  the  highway,  and  at  the  same  downgrade,   priorities  can  be  determined  for  the  appropriate  selection  of  the  location  of  the  TER.

Types  

Many   types   of   TERs   exist,   however   the   three   main   basic   categories   of   TERs   are:   gravel,   sand   pile,  and  arrestor  bed  [3].  The  arrestor  bed  TER  design  can  be  further  categorized  as:  horizontal   grade,   descending   grade,   and   ascending   grade   [3].   These   designs   are   shown   in   Figure   3.   Alternate  versions  and  new  state  of  the  art  of  TERs  exist,  such  as  the  Dragnet  Escape  System   implemented  on  Ontario's  Highway  11,  which  uses  additional  elements  to  further  improve  the

design  of  the  TER,  however,  for  the  purpose  of  this  project,  only  the  aforementioned  four  types   of  basic  TERs  will  be  considered  for  the  reliability  analysis  [6].

2.4.1   Gravity  
The  most  basic  type  of  TER  is  the  gravity  TER,  which  consists  of  a  paved  surface  which  simply   depends  on  gravity  in  combination  with  an  ascending  grade  to  slow  down  and  stop  the  runaway   truck  [3].  Gravity  TERs  are  typically  adjacent  existing  roads  or  are  created  as  an  ascending  grade   parallel   to   the   travelled   way   [1,   3].   Since   this   type   of   TER   relies   solely   on   gravity,   a   longer   stopping  distance,  and  thus  a  longer  design  length,  is  required  to  ensure  the  runaway  vehicle   comes  to  a  complete  stop.  Even  if  the  vehicle  comes  to  a  complete  stop,  it  may  roll  backwards   or  jackknife,  which  can  be  dangerous.  Furthermore,  there  may  not  be  an  adjacent  side  road  to   utilize   as   a   TER.   For   these   reasons,   this   design   is   the   least   preferred   of   the   available   TER   design   options.   10  

  

  

2.4.2   Sand  Pile  
As  the  name  suggests,  the  basic  design  of  a  sand  pile  TER  is  piling  loose,  dry  sand  at  the  base  of   the  TER.  Since  sand  has  very  strong  deceleration  characteristics,  this  type  of  TER  is  typically  120   meters   in   length   or   shorter.   As   a   result   of   this   severe   deceleration   in   combination   with   the   fact   that   sand   is   strongly   affected   by   weather   elements,   sand   pile   TERs   are   not   very   desirable   in   comparison   to   an   arrestor   bed.   With   that   being   said,   a   sand   pile   TER   is   a   good   alternative   in   situations  where  there  is  insufficient  space  available  for  a  longer  ramp.  Sand  pile  TERs  are  also   beneficial  when  used  in  conjunction  with  other  TER  designs  at  the  terminal  point,  if  adequate   TER  length  using  an  alternate  design  cannot  be  achieved  [3].  

2.4.3   Arrestor  Bed  ­  Horizontal  Grade,  Descending  Grade,  Ascending  Grade  
An  arrestor  bed  TER  is  the  most  commonly  implemented  TER  design  and  slows  down  runaway   vehicles   by   displacing   arrestor   bed   aggregate.   The   arrestor   bed   material   provides   the   rolling   resistance  against  the  runaway  vehicle  and  permits  controlled  deceleration  and  thus  a  shorter   stopping   distance   [7].   Arrestor   beds   can   be   designed   and   constructed   on   a   horizontal   grade,   descending   grade,   or   ascending   grade.   According   to   the   TAC   Guide,   arrestor   bed   TERs   use   "a   regulated   depth   of   loose   sized   gravel   contained   in   form"   [3].   Using   a   loose   material,   such   as   loose  gravel,  increases  the  system's  rolling  resistance.  This  assists  the  deceleration  and  eventual   halt  of  the  runaway  vehicle  by  dissipating  the  kinetic  energy  to  the  arrestor  bed  aggregate  and   overcoming  the  shear  resistance  [3].  Unlike  the  sand  pile  TER  design,  the  loose  material  in  the   arrestor   bed   design   prevents   trucks   on   an   ascending   grade   from   rolling   backwards.   However,   similar  to  a  sand  pile,  the  use  of  loose  material  in  an  arrestor  bed  makes  it  difficult  to  remove   11  

  

  

the  runaway  vehicle  from  the  TER  bed,  and  alternate  means  such  as  anchors  are  required  for   extraction   [3].   A   benefit   of   implementing   an   arrestor   bed   TER   design   in   comparison   to   the   aforementioned  designs  is  that  an  arrestor  bed  TER  can  be  implemented  on  any  roadway  grade   (i.e.   positive,   negative,   or   horizontal   grades)   which   gives   the   designer   more   options   when   selecting  the  TER  location  [3].   The   most   common   and   ideal   type   of   arrestor   bed   is   an   ascending   grade,   as   gravity   in   combination   with   rolling   resistance   allows   this   type   of   arrestor   bed   to   be   designed   at   the   shortest   lengths   of   all   arrestor   bed   types   [3].   This   is   beneficial   in   locations   where   space   is   limited.   Next,   the   horizontal   arrestor   bed   depends   on   rolling   resistance   alone,   and   must   be   longer  than  an  ascending  grade  TER  [3].  Lastly,  the  descending  grade  arrestor  bed  is  the  longest   of  the  arrestor  beds  as  gravity  is  working  against  the  rolling  resistance  forces  and  hinders  the   speed  reduction  and  eventual  stopping  of  the  runaway  vehicle.

2.5.1   Forces  Affecting  Truck  Speed  
According   to   the   TAC   Guide,   there   are   three   forces   which   affect   truck   speed.   These   include   forces   generated   by   the   engine,   braking,   and   tractive   resistance.   However,   when   designing   truck   escape   ramps,   only   the   tractive   resistance   force   is   considered   as   this   is   the   worst   case   scenario   in   which   the   truck's   brakes   have   failed   and   the   truck   is   "out   of   gear",   essentially   in   neutral.   This   is   caused   by   a   missed   gear   downshift   and   improperly   adjusted   brakes   which   impose  a  higher  demand  and  heat  buildup  on  the  functioning  brakes,  causing  the  brakes  to  fade   and  fail  [3].     12  

  

  

The  tractive  resistance  force  can  be  broken  down  into  four  main  forces:  air  resistance,  inertial   resistance,   gradient   resistance,   and   rolling   resistance   forces.   The   air   resistance,   positive   gradient   resistance,   and   rolling   resistance   forces   impede   the   vehicle's   motion.   However,   the   inertial  resistance  and  negative  gradient  resistance  forces  facilitate  the  truck's  motion  [3].  The   tractive  resistance  forces  are  illustrated  in  Figure  4  below.  

  
Figure  4  ­  Tractive  Resistance  Forces  as  Illustrated  on  a  Truck  in  Motion  (Reproduced  with  the  express  written  authority  of   the  Transportation  Association  of  Canada  (TAC).  Excerpted  from  the  TAC  publication:  Geometric  Design  Guide  for  Canadian   Roads  (1999))  [3]  

Air   resistance   is   negligible   at   vehicle   speeds   below   30   km/hr   yet   causes   a   great   amount   of   resistance   at   vehicle   speeds   over   80   km/hr,   according   to   the   TAC   Guide   [3].   However,   the   force   induced   by   air   resistance   is   ignored   when   calculating   the   required   length   of   a   truck   escape   ramp,  as  seen  in  Equation  1,  which  results  in  a  smaller  safety  factor.   The   force   exerted   by   inertial   resistance   "resists   movement   of   a   vehicle   at   rest   or   maintains   a   vehicle  in  motion,  unless  the  vehicle  is  acted  on  by  some  external  force",  according  to  the  TAC   Guide  [3].  Positive  gradient  resistance  and  rolling  resistance  overcome  inertial  resistance  [3].   13  

  

  

Gradient  resistance,  either  positive  or  negative,  is  due  to  gravity.  A  positive  gradient  (up-grade),   creates   a   positive   gradient   resistance   which   slows   down   the   vehicle   in   motion   and   is   a   beneficial   force   for   a   TER.   However,   a   negative   gradient   (down-grade),   creates   a   negative   gradient   resistance   which   reduces   the   forces   which   would   otherwise   stop   or   slow   down   the   truck.   The   total   gradient   resistance   is   a   function   of   the   steepness   of   the   grade   and   the   truck   mass.   According   to   the   TAC   Guide,   for   every   percent   grade,   the   gradient   resistance   is   10   kilograms  per  1000  kilograms  of  gross  vehicle  mass  (GVM)  [3].   Rolling  resistance  is  only  applicable  to  a  vehicle  in  motion  and  is  a  force  that  resists  movement   between  the  roadway  surface  and  the  tires.  Depending  on  the  roadway  surfacing  material,  such   as  sand  or  loose  gravel,  the  rolling  resistance  will  vary,  as  seen  in  Table  1,  expressed  in  kilogram   per  1000  kilogram  of  GVM  [3].

If  it  is  not  possible  to  meet  the  TER  design  length  requirement,  positive  attenuation  devices  can   be   placed   at   the   end   of   the   TER,   such   as   an   group   of   crash   cushions   in   the   form   of   barrels   filled   with  bedding  material,  mounds  of  arrestor  bed  material,  or  a  drag-net.  It  should  be  noted  that   positive   attenuation   devices   should   only   be   used   if   the   effects   of   colliding   with   the   device   outweigh   the   effects   of   overrunning   the   TER,   as   these   devices   may   in   fact   jeopardize   the   safety   of  the  vehicle's  occupant(s)  rather  than  increase  their  safety  [3].

The   layout   of   the   TER   lane   should   not   include   any   changes   in   the   horizontal   alignment   and   should   be   straight.   The   TER   should   also   be   at   a   flush   angle   to   the   through   roadway,   approximately  5°  or  less.  This  smooth  transition  from  the  through  roadway  to  the  TER  is  critical   as  the  vehicle  will  be  entering  the  TER  at  a  very  high  speed  and  in  most  cases  out  of  control.  The   user  must  feel  also  safe  while  navigating  the  TER,  which  is  enhanced  with  a  smooth  transition.   Furthermore,  it  is  necessary  that  the  user  can  see  all  or  most  of  the  TER  in  order  to  ensure  safe   navigation  [3].

vehicle   is   4   m   for   gravity   ramps,   and   a   minimum   5   m   for   all   other   types   of   TER.   A   9   m   to   a   maximum  12  m  width  is  ideal  for  two  lane  TER  operation  [3].

Service   lanes   between   3.5   m   to   4   m   wide,   either   gravel   or   paved,   and   anchors   should   be   included   along   the   TER   to   facilitate   vehicle   extraction.   In   addition,   a   truck   restraining   barrier   may  be  installed  on  the  outside  edge  of  the  TER  in  cases  where  the  out  of  control  vehicle  may   exit  through  the  side  of  the  TER  and  impose  a  hazard  to  adjacent  activity  such  as  an  urban  or   residential  area  [3].  

2.5.6   TER  Arrestor  Bed  Details  &  Design  Elements  
The  most  common  type  of  TER  used  in  practice  is  the  arrestor  bed,  and  therefore  requires  more   design  consideration.

Figure  10  -  Typical  TER  Cross  Section    (Reproduced  with  the  express  written  authority  of  the  Transportation  Association  of   Canada  (TAC).  Excerpted  from  the  TAC  publication:  Geometric  Design  Guide  for  Canadian  Roads  (1999))  [3]  

When   a   vehicle   enters   an   arrestor   bed,   it   will   sink   approximately   300   mm   to   450   mm.   Therefore,   in   order   to   allow   a   steady   deceleration,   the   bedding   is   tapered   from   roughly   75   mm   to  full  bed  depth  in  30  m  to  100  m.  The  depth  of  the  bedding  material  varies  from  450  mm  to   600  mm  according  to  the  Ontario  Roadside  Safety  Manual  [3].   The  arrestor  bed  which  holds  the  bedding  material  is  trapezoidal  and  designed  with  a  2:1  side   slope   on   each   side.   This   controls   the   runaway   vehicle's   direction   and   stability   within   the   arrestor  bed  and  facilitates  vehicle  extraction  [3].  
2.5.6.2  Arrestor  Bed  Materials  

In  order  to  ensure  proper  functioning  of  the  arrestor  bed  TER,  the  following  guidelines  should   be  followed,  as  per  the  TAC  Guide:   1.   Loose   material   should   be   clean,   have   a   high   coefficient   of   friction,   and   should   not   be   easily  compacted  to  allow  the  vehicle  to  sink  into  the  aggregate  upon  entering  the  TER,   20  

  

   2.   Although   smaller   aggregate   provides   a   quicker   deceleration,   large,   predominant,   single- sized   aggregates   reduce   moisture   retention   and   freeze-thaw   issues   associated   with   small-sized  aggregate,   3.   Avoid  fractured  angular  aggregate  which  withstands  the  weight  of  the  vehicle  and  thus   decreases  the  rolling  resistance,     4.   Use  uniformly  graded  and  well-rounded  aggregate  which  can  displace  easily  and  allow   the   runaway   vehicle   to   sink   into   aggregate   thus   increasing   rolling   resistance   and   maximizing  deceleration,   5.   Use   aggregate   with   high   rolling   resistance   in   order   to   allow   shorter   TER   lengths   which   area  also  more  economical,   6.   Pea   gravel   is   the   most   desirable   material   as   it   has   a   high   rolling   resistance,   especially   when  installing  a  TER  at  locations  where  freezing  is  of  concern,  and   7.   Particle  size  should  range  between  15  mm  to  20  mm,  free  of  fines,  and  at  a  maximum  40   mm,  for  best  performance  [3,  7].  

2.5.6.3  Arrestor  Bed  Drainage  

Proper  drainage  is  critical  to  avoid  freezing  and  ensure  the  TER  is  operable  in  the  winter.  Proper   drainage   also   ensures   contamination   at   the   base   of   the   arrestor   bed   is   minimized.   To   ensure   proper   drainage,   the   base   of   the   arrestor   bed   should   be   designed   with   a   3%   cross   slope   and   include  sub  drains  and  an  open  graded  drainage  layer  [3].

Variability  in  Design  Variables  and  Their  Effects  

As  previously  mentioned,  arrestor  beds  displace  the  bedding  material  in  order  to  slow  down  the   runaway  vehicle.  This  displacement  in  combination  with  nature's  elements  will  not  always  yield   the   design   specifications   in   practice.   In   other   words,   if   the   TER   was   designed   with   a   rolling   resistance   equal   to   0.25   kg/kg   GVM,   in   reality   the   rolling   resistance   may   be   higher   or   lower,   which  can  alter  the  TER  performance.

In  fact,  this  variability  in  design  variables  can  ultimately  affect  the  supply  length  of  the  TER  in   practice.  The  performance  of  an  arrestor  bed  TER  depends  primarily  on  the  effects  of  nature's   elements,   proper   maintenance,   the   geometry   of   the   bed   in   terms   of   length   and   depth,   and   the   characteristics  of  the  bedding  material  in  terms  of  gradation  and  shape  [7].     In   order   to   compare   a   TER   design   to   the   implemented   TER   in   practice,   the   Arizona   Department   of  Transportation  (ADOT)  conducted  testing  at  four  existing  TER  arrestor  beds  in  Arizona:  I-17   NB,   I-17   SB,   US   89,   and   SR   77.   The   main   focus   of   the   study   was   to   analyze   the   rolling   resistance   of  the  arrestor  bed  aggregate  while  evaluating  various  maintenance  methods  [7].   In   order   to   assess   the   rolling   resistance   of   the   in-place   aggregate,   102   tests   were   conducted   using  an  unloaded,  5-axle,  single-trailer  truck  which  entered  the  TER  at  approximately  70  km/hr   (45   mph)   and   105   km/hr   (65   mph)   [7].   In   order   to   back   calculate   the   rolling   resistance,   radar   was  used  to  measure  the  difference  in  vehicle  speed  at  1/20-second  intervals  [7].  The  influence   arrestor  bed  preparation  has  on  the  rolling  resistance  was  also  assessed  using  three  different   preparation   techniques.   Lastly,   ADOT   evaluated   the   stopping   distance   required   for   runaway   vehicles  that  entered  the  arrestor  bed  TER  in  tracks  left  by  a  previous  vehicle  that  used  the  TER   [7].  The  results  of  the  analysis  are  displayed  in  Figure  13.  

23

In  all  cases,  the  supply  length  of  the  existing  TER  is  longer  than  the  required  TER  supply  length   demanded   by   the   runaway   vehicle   using   the   TER.   This   means   the   existing   rolling   resistance   supplied  by  the  current  TER  exceeds  the  design  rolling  resistance.  According  to  the  study,  this   means   the   length   of   the   TER   can   be   reduced   by   approximately   55   m,   and   the   depth   of   the   arrestor  bed  aggregate  can  be  reduced  by  approximately  3.7  m  [7].  It  was  also  noted  that  when   a   runaway   vehicle   follows   in   the   tracks   of   a   previous   runaway   vehicle,   the   required   stopping   distance   increases   by   almost   20%   [7].   Therefore,   the   removal   of   theses   tracks   is   critical   in   ensuring  proper  functioning  of  the  TER.   These  results  indicate  that  runaway  vehicle  entering  speed,  bedding  material  preparation,  and   vehicle  tracking  all  greatly  affect  the  required  stopping  distance  of  a  runaway  vehicle  and  thus   the  distance  travelled  into  the  arrestor  bed  TER.     24  

  

  

Benefits  associated  to  these  findings  include  a  more  economical  TER  design  as  a  shorter  TER  can   be   constructed,   saving   at   least   $30,000   per   site   in   Arizona,   and   hundreds   of   thousands   of   dollars  in  locations  where  large  fill  or  cut  requirements  exist,  such  as  mountainous  regions  [7].   Furthermore,  the  results  show  the  age  of  the  aggregate  does  not  affect  the  performance  as  one   TER  arrestor  bed  in  the  study  was  of  concern  to  ADOT  due  to  its  "old  aggregate  gradation"  [7].   This   means   there   is   no   need   to   replace   this   aggregate,   further   reducing   anticipated   maintenance  and  construction  costs.

TER  Case  Studies  

2.7.1   TERs  in  Colorado  
A   study   was   conducted   on   Colorado's   TERs   by   the   National   Cooperative   Highway   Research   Program  in  1992.  This  study  reveals  that  46%  of  TER  usage  was  by  runaway  vehicles  with  a  gross   vehicle   weight   between   70,000   lbs   and   80,000   lbs   [4].   Furthermore,   38%   of   all   TER   entries   occurred  during  the  summer,  24%  during  the  fall,  14%  during  the  winter,  and  24%  during  the   spring  [4].  Of  the  vehicles  using  the  TER,  27%  of  the  uses  were  due  to  failed  brakes  and  11%  due   to   loss   of   air   pressure   [4].   Additionally,   47%   of   the   runaway   vehicles   entered   the   TER   at   speeds   ranging  between  50  km/hr  and  100  km/hr,  13%  entered  at  speeds  between  100  km/hr  to  130   km/hr,   and   17%   entered   at   speeds   of   130   km/hr   or   higher   [4].   Lastly,   72%   of   all   runaway   vehicles  stopped  within  180  m  [4].   The   Colorado   Interstate   Highway   70   (I-70)   in   Mt.   Vernon   Canyon   was   studied   in   more   detail.   The   I-70   is   a   negative   grade   arrestor   bed   with   gravel   type   bedding   material   and   a   5.2%   downgrade  [8].  Over  three  years,  the  TER  stopped  53  runaway  vehicles,  with  no  injuries  or  fatal   25  

  

  

crashes   reported   [8].   In   the   same   study   period,   18   accidents   were   reported   which   involved   runaway   vehicles   which   did   not   use   the   TER,   resulting   in   24   injuries   and   7   fatalities   [8].   From   these  results  it  is  clear  that  the  implementation  of  a  TER  can  significantly  increase  safety  and   reduce  the  number  of  fatal  crashes.  

2.7.2   Drag  Net  TER  Systems  
An  alternate  example  of  a  TER  design  is  a  drag  net  system  which  includes  additional  elements   and   may   reduce   the   required   length   of   a   TER.   According   to   the   Wyoming   Department   of   Transportation   (WYDOT),   the   Drag   Net   design   is   100%   successful   when   used   by   a   runaway   vehicle  [9].  This  system  uses  a  sequence  of  nets  which  are  installed  along  the  TER  and  arranged   in   such   a   way   as   to   stop   the   runaway   vehicle   within   the   length   of   the   TER   while   diminishing   deceleration   forces   [9].   The   nets   are   made   of   aircraft   cable   and   are   connected   to   energy   absorbers   which   are   mounted   to   the   TER   concrete   walls   [9].   According   to   WYDOT,   a   4,500   lb   runaway   vehicle   travelling   at   100   km/hr   and   intercepting   a   9   m   wide   drag   net   will   stop   in   approximately  25  m  [9].

Ten   runaway   vehicle   cases   were   studied   by   WYDOT.   In   six   cases,   the   runaway   vehicle   driver   used  the  drag  net  TER  system  appropriately,  resulting  in  no  injuries  and  no  fatalities  [9].  On  the   other  hand,  in  four  cases,  drivers  bypassed  the  Drag  Net  TER  system  and  resulted  in  one  injury   and  4  fatalities  [9].  Statistics  from  some  of  these  cases  are  shown  in  Table  2.

A   drag   net   TER   system   has   been   implemented   on   Ontario's   Highway   11   at   Thibeault   Hills,   as   seen  in  Figure  16  [6].  This  drag  net  system  `catches'  the  runaway  vehicle  using  seven  metal  nets   attached  to  energy  absorbers  [6].  This  design  requires  nominal  maintenance,  works  very  well  in   winter   months,   and   only   demands   140   m   for   the   runaway   vehicle   to   stop   in   comparison   to   a   370  m  standard  gravel  bed  [6].

Since  the  runaway  vehicle  can  stop  in  a  shorter  distance  using  a  drag  net  system,  this  type  of   TER   can   be   placed   further   down   the   through   roadway   which   gives   users   an   opportunity   to   determine  whether  or  not  their  vehicle  is  experiencing  brake  issues  prior  to  entering  the  TER   [6].

A   reliability   model   is   a   statistical   analysis   tool   used   to   limit   the   probability   of   failure   of   a   particular  engineering  system  of  interest.  In  terms  of  reliability  modelling,  the  term  `failure'  is   understood   as   the   failure   of   the   particular   engineering   system   to   fulfill   a   specific   limit   state   criterion,  which  may  or  may  not  necessarily  be  definite  system  failure  [10].     Reliability  of  an  engineering  system  is  defined  as  the  engineering  system's  ability  to  meet  the   system  performance  requirements  over  a  specified  time  period  [11].  This  `ability'  is  measured   using  statistics  and  probability  theory  as  the  fundamental  basis  of  analysis  [10,  12].  Therefore,   reliability  can  also  be  defined  as  the   probability  that  failure  will  not  ensue,  and  is  equal  to  one   minus  the  probability  of  failure  [10,  12].  For  example,  if  the  reliability  of  a  system  is  98%,  the   probability  of  failure  is  equal  to  2%.     When   analyzing   the   reliability   of   an   engineering   system,   a   performance   function   is   established,   equal   to   the   system   supply   less   system   demand,   where   the   failure   state   occurs   when   the   performance  function  is  negative  [13].  In  regards  to  this  study,  the  reliability  analysis  attempts   to  eliminate  the  probability  that  the  TER  design  length  reaches  failure  state,  where  the  runaway   vehicle   will   demand   a   TER   length   that   exceeds   the   supplied   TER   design   length.   With   this   in   mind,   designing   a   TER   that   guarantees   100%   user   safety   is   impractical,   unrealistic,   and   extremely  expensive.  As  a  result,  an  acceptable  probability  of  failure,  or  level  of  risk,  must  be   agreed   upon   by   the   designer   [14].   Once   a   suitable   probability   of   failure   is   determined,   a   reliability  analysis  can  provide  information  regarding  the  required  TER  design  length.

This  report  uses  two  methods  of  reliability  analysis  which  limit  the  probability  the  TER  design   length   will   reach   failure   state.   These   two   reliability   analysis   methods   include   the   First   Order   Second   Moment   (FOSM)   method   and   the   Advanced   First   Order   Second   Moment   (AFOSM)   method.   Each   method   simplifies   the   functional   relationship   of   the   engineering   system   design   using   a   condensed   Taylor   series   expansion   where   the   inputs   and   outputs   of   the   model   are   expressed  as  mean  values  with  respective  variance  and  standard  deviation  values  [13].     The   performance   function   of   a   reliability   model   is   defined   by   random   variables   inputs,   each   with   a   respective   mean   value,   variance,   and   standard   deviation.   The   FOSM   method   is   much   simpler   than   the   AFOSM   method   and   expands   the   performance   function   at   each   random   variable's  mean  value,  whereas  the  AFOSM  method  is  an  iterative  procedure  which  expands  the   performance  function  at  a  point  on  the  failure  boundary  [13].    

3.1  

Method  1  -  FOSM  Reliability  Method  

The  FOSM  reliability  model  is  so  named  since  the  analysis  uses  a  Taylor  series  approximation  of   the   first   order,   and   only   second   moment   information   is   considered   regarding   the   random   variables  [15].  FOSM  reliability  model  analysis  approximates  the  mean  value  and  variance  of  a   random   variable,   which   are   also   referred   to   as   the   "first   two   moments",   where   the   random   variable  is  a  nonlinear  function  of  some  other  random  variables  [13].  Assume  a  safety  margin,   SM,  is  equal  to  a  nonlinear  performance  function  which  is  a  function  of  many  random  variables,   as  displayed  in  Equation  3.  If  SM  is  equal  to  a  negative  value  (SM  <  0),  then  the  performance   function   has   reached   a   state   of   failure.   If   SM   is   equal   to   0   (SM   =   0),   then   the   performance  

31  

  

  

function  is  at  the  limit  state.  If  SM  is  equal  to  a  positive  value  (SM  >  0),  then  the  performance   function  is  at  a  safe  state.  The  goal  of  the  reliability  analysis  is  to  avoid  failure  state.    = (/ , % , ... , 8 )

Using   Taylor   series   expansion,   the   function   f   in   Equation   3   can   be   expanded   about   the   mean   value  of  each  random  variable,  as  displayed  in  Equation  4  [13].

Furthermore,   the   coefficient   of   variation,   CVXi,   for   a   given   random   variable,   Xi,   is   a   dimensionless  measure  of  the  unpredictability,  dispersion,  and  variability  of  the  selected  data   [14].  The  coefficient  of  variations  is  given  by  [13]:     :" = :"    :" (8)

In  terms  of  analyzing  the  TER  length  design,  the  probability  of  failure  expresses  the  probability   the  supplied  TER  design  length  is  shorter  than  the  TER  length  demand  dictated  by  a  runaway   vehicle.   Consider   the   TER   design   length,   Lsupply,   and   the   distance   required   for   a   runaway   vehicle   to   come   to   a   complete   stop   given   the   conditions   set   out   in   the   TER   design,   Ldemand.   Since   the   value  of  Lsupply  and  the  value  of  Ldemand  is  a  function  of  random  variables,  consequently,  Lsupply  and   Ldemand   are   considered   random   variables   with   respective   probability   density   functions   (PDFs)   [10].   Figure   17   shows   the   assumed   PDFs   for   Lsupply   and   Ldemand.   The   shaded   area   below   the   overlapping   PDF   curves   indicates   the   failure   region   where   Lsupply  is   less   than   Ldemand.   If   Lsupply  is   subtracted  from  Ldemand,  the  resulting  value  is  equal  to  the  safety  margin,  SM,  and  a  probability   curve  is  obtained,  shown  in  Figure  18.  The  failure  region,  or  probability  of  failure  (Pf),  is  equal  to   the  area  where  SM  is  negative.

The   probability   of   failure   is   a   function   of   a   reliability   index,   ,   which   is   a   safety   measure   related   to  the  probability  that  Ldemand  is  greater  than  Lsupply  [14].  Alternatively,  the  reliability  index  can   34  

  

  

be  described  as  a  factor  which  expresses  how  reliable  a  system  is  to  prevent  failure  [14].  Figure   18  can  be  used  to  determine  a  reliability  index.  The  reliability  index,  ,  defines  the  number  of   standard  deviations  between    MN   and  the  limit  state,  SM  =  0,  where  [13]:   = MN    MN (9)

The  larger  the  reliability  index  value,  the  smaller  the  probability  of  failure.  Assuming  the  safety   margin,  SM,  has  a  normal  distribution,  and  using  standard  normal  variate  tables,  the  probability   of  failure  can  be  estimated  as  follows:     Q =  - = 1 - ()

Method  2  ­  AFOSM  Reliability  Method  

Although   the   FOSM   reliability   method   provides   a   rather   simple   reliability   analysis,   it   suffers   from  the  problem  of  invariance  [15].  If  the  SM  is  linear,  then  the  mean  and  standard  deviation   will   be   accurately   assessed   using   the   FOSM   method,   however,   if   the   limit   state   function,   SM,   is   non-linear,   then   the   FOSM   analysis   uses   first-order   approximations   and   may   introduce   errors   [15].  This  means  that  depending  on  the  way  the  same  SM  equation  is  expressed  (i.e.  SM  =  3y2  +   3xy  vs.  SM  =  3y(y+x)),  different  reliability  index  values  would  be  produced  [10].  Therefore,  an   invariant   method,   AFOSM,   was   developed.   Based   on   the   same   principles   outlined   using   the   FOSM  method,  the  AFOSM  method  uses  an  iterative  procedure  which  expands  SM  at  a  point  on   the   failure   boundary,   and   ultimately   yields   a   maximum   probability   of   failure   [10,   13].   The   following  algorithm  can  be  used  to  determine  the  reliability  index  after  a  number  of  iterations.     First,   assume   a   safety   margin,   SM,   equal   to   a   nonlinear   performance   function   which   is   a   function  of  many  random  variables,  as  displayed  in  Equation  3.  Determine  an  expression  for  a   new  function,  g(Xi),  by  replacing  each  random  variable  in  the  performance  function  with  Xi  [10].   Next,  substitute  each  Xi  using  Equation  11,  for  all  random  variables  to  develop  an  expression  for   a  new  function,  h(y)  [13].   " = " " + "

Where:        

     

i  =  standard  deviation  of  random  variable  i,   yi  =  variable  used  for  future  iterations,   36  

           

   mi  =  mean  value  of  random  variable  i  [10].    

Then,  evolve  an  equation  for  each  first  derivative  of  h(y),  hi'.   To  begin  an  iteration,  assume  values  yi  =  0,  and    =  0.  Using  these  values,  evaluate  h(y),  hi',  and   SM,  where  the  standard  deviation  of  SM  is  calculated  as  follows  [10]:

This  concludes  Iteration  1.     For  the  next  iteration,  calculate  new  values  for  yi  given  the  following  equation  [10]:

This  process  is  then  repeated  until  the  reliability  index,  ,  converges.  As  previously  mentioned,   the  larger  the  reliability  index  value,  the  smaller  the  probability  of  failure.

Development  of  Reliability  Models  for  TERs  

The  purpose  of  conducting  a  reliability  analysis  on  TERs  is  that  the  existing  design  approach,  as   discussed   in   Section   2.5,   is   deterministic,   and   does   not   consider   variations   in   the   design   variables  or  the  probability  that  the  design  will  fail  [13].   Four  cases  were  established  for  TER  design  analysis  based  on  the  existing  design  approach:   Case  1:  FOSM  Reliability  Method  ­  One  TER  Grade   Case  2:  FOSM  Reliability  Method  ­  Two  TER  Grades   Case  3:  AFOSM  Reliability  Method  ­  One  TER  Grade   Case  4:  AFOSM  Reliability  Method  ­  Two  TER  Grades   The  methodology  for  each  model  is  discussed  in  this  section,  along  with  sample  calculations  for   each  model.  The  results  can  be  found  in  Appendix  A  through  Appendix  D.

120km/hr,  and  140km/hr.  These  speeds  were  selected  since  TER  ramps  are  normally  designed   for  trucks  entering  a  TER  at  a  speed  of  130  km/hr  to  140  km/hr  [3].  However,  in  reality,  trucks   can   enter   a   TER   at   lower   speeds   such   as   100km/hr   or   120km/hr.   Secondly,   the   rolling   resistance,   R,   was   analyzed   at   a   mean   value   corresponding   to   pea   gravel,   0.25kg/kg   GVM,   as   selected  from  Table  1.  This  value  was  selected  since  the  majority  of  TERs  analyzed  in  Section  2.7   use  pea  gravel.  Lastly,  the  percent  grade,  G1,  was  analyzed  at  mean  values  ranging  from  +10%   to  -10%  for  practicality  purposes.     The   standard   deviation,   ,   must   be   calculated   for   each   random   variable   using   the   following   equation:     " =   "

Step  4  through  Step  12,  as  outlined  in  Segment  2  of  Section  4.4.1,  are  described  in  detail  below.     Step   4   -   Set   Coefficient   of   Variation,   Mean   Value,   and   Standard   Deviation   to   Random   Variables   For  consistency,  the  same  coefficient  of  variation  set  for  each  analysis  in  Segment  1  was  set  to   all  variables  in  Segment  2:   5%   10%   15%   20%   25%  

The  following  mean  values  were  set  for  each  random  variable:

The  mean  value  and  standard  deviation  for  the  random  variable  V2  were  previously  calculated   in  Segment  1  and  are  used  for  Segment  2.  Therefore,  using  Equation  17,  the  standard  deviation,   ,  was  only  calculated  for  the  random  variables  G2  and  R  at  each  selected  CV  value.  A  sample   calculation   for   random   variable   G2   and   CV   =   5%   is   shown   below.   The   results   of   this   step   are   shown  in  Table  27.   b =   d% = 0.05  0.04 = 0.002

Analysis  of  Results  
General  Observations  

After  analyzing  the  results  of  all  four  cases,  some  general  observations  can  be  made  regarding   the  study  as  a  whole.     To  begin,  each  case  follows  the  same  downward  trend;  a  large  TER  supply  length  is  required  for   a  low  probability  of  failure  and  a  shorter  TER  supply  length  is  required  for  a  higher  probability  of   failure.   Furthermore,   in   each   case,   the   TER   supply   length   tapers   off   once   the   probability   of   failure   exceeds   5%.   Intuitively   this   makes   sense   as   a   longer   TER   offers   the   runaway   vehicle   a   longer  stopping  distance  than  is  required  and  therefore  a  lower  probability  the  TER  design  will   fail,   whereas   a   shorter   TER,   although   more   economical,   may   not   provide   enough   stopping   distance  for  the  runaway  vehicle,  and  thus  a  higher  probability  the  TER  design  could  fail.   When  designing  a  TER,  particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  critical  design  area,  between   1%  to  5%,  where  the  TER  supply  length  increases  rapidly  as  the  probability  of  failure  is  reduced.   This   observation   was   noted   for   all   four   cases.   For   example,   in   Case   1,   Scenario   1,   CV   =   25%   (FOSM   Reliability   Analysis,   G1   =   +2%,   V1   =   140   km/hr,   R   =   0.25kg/kgGVM),   the   required   TER   supply   length   increased   by   up   to   20%.   As   a   result,   it   is   highly   recommended   to   design   a   TER   using   a   probability   of   failure   below   5%   or   as   small   as   possible,   as   this   significant   change   in   length  can  severely  affect  the  reliability  of  the  design.     It  was  also  noted  that  the  coefficient  of  variation  strongly  affected  the  supply  length  of  the  TER.   For  a  larger  coefficient  of  variation,  which  accounts  for  more  variation  in  the  design  variables,  a   longer  TER  supply  length  is  required.  For  a  smaller  coefficient  of  variation,  which  accounts  for   less   variation   in   the   design   variables   and   is   less   accurate,   a   shorter   TER   supply   length   is   81  

  

  

required.  As  a  result,  the  change  in  the  TER  supply  length  over  a  range  of  probability  of  failure  is   minimal  for  smaller  CV  values  and  larger  for  larger  CV  values.  For  example,  in  Case  1,  Scenario   1,   the   TER   supply   length   for   CV   =   25%   is   292.4   m   greater   than   CV   =   1%,   which   is   a   81.5%   difference.   Furthermore,   in   Case   1,   Scenario   1,   the   change   in   TER   supply   length   over   a   range   of   Pf  =  1%  to  Pf  =  15%  is  a  12.8%  difference  for  CV  =  5%  and  a  45.3%  difference  for  a  CV  =  25%.  This   range  in  values  is  significant,  and  designers  should  perform  a  benefit  cost  analysis  to  determine   a  CV  value  that  will  optimize  safety  while  creating  an  economical  design.  

5.2  

Effect  of  Changes  in  Speed    

In  order  to  analyze  the  effects  of  speed  on  the  TER  supply  length,  Case  1,  Scenario  1,  where  V  =   140   km/hr   and   Case   1,   Scenario   3   where   V   =   100   km/hr,   were   analyzed   and   plotted   on   the   graph  in  Figure  24.  All  other  variables  in  Case  1,  Scenario  1  and  Scenario  3  were  identical  (i.e.   FOSM  Reliability  Analysis,  G1  =  +2%,  R  =  0.25kg/kgGVM).   Figure  24  makes  it  clear  that  increased  vehicle  speed  strongly  affects  the  supply  length  of  the   TER.  For  a  larger  speed,  a  longer  TER  supply  length  is  required.  For  a  smaller  speed,  a  shorter   TER   supply   length   is   required.   These   results   reflect   intuition   as   vehicles   travelling   at   higher   speeds   require   a   longer   distance   to   come   to   a   complete   stop.   For   example,   for   a   CV   =   25%,   the   TER   supply   length   is   319   m   longer,   or   a   96%   difference,   for   a   vehicle   travelling   140   km/hr   (Case   1,  Scenario  1)  in  comparison  to  a  vehicle  travelling  100  km/hr  (Case  1,  Scenario  3).  This  range  in   values  is  very  significant,  and  designers  should  perform  a  benefit  cost  analysis  to  determine  a   design  speed  that  will  optimize  safety  while  creating  an  economical  design.

In  order  to  analyze  the  effect  grade  has  on  the  TER  supply  length,  Case  1,  Scenario  1,  where  G  =   +2%  and  Case  1,  Scenario  9  where  G  =  -2%,  were  analyzed  and  plotted  on  the  graph  in  Figure   25.  All  other  variables  in  Case  1,  Scenario  1  and  Scenario  9  were  identical  (i.e.  FOSM  Reliability   Analysis,  V1  =  140  km/hr,  R  =  0.25kg/kgGVM).   Figure  25  makes  it  clear  that  the  TER  grade  slightly  affects  the  supply  length  of  the  TER.  For  a   negative   grade,   a   longer   TER   supply   length   is   required.   For   a   positive   grade,   a   shorter   TER   supply   length   is   required.   These   results   reflect   intuition   as   vehicles   travelling   downgrade   require   a   longer   distance   to   come   to   a   complete   stop   due   to   the   failed   brake   system   in   combination   with   the   force   of   gravity.   For   example,   for   a   CV   =   25%,   the   TER   supply   length   is   127.5   m   longer,   or   19.6%   greater,   for   a   vehicle   travelling   downgrade   at   G   =   -2%   (Case   1,   Scenario   9)   in   comparison   to   a   vehicle   travelling   upgrade   at   G   =   +2%   (Case   1,   Scenario   1).   Although   this   difference   is   smaller   than   the   change   in   speed,   this   range   in   values   is   still   significant,   and   designers   should   perform   a   benefit   cost   analysis   to   determine   a   TER   grade   that   will  optimize  safety  while  creating  an  economical  design.

Effect  of  Reliability  Method  (FOSM  vs  AFOSM)  

Since  two  reliability  methods  were  used  to  assess  identical  TER  designs,  the  results  from  each   method   were   compared.   First   one   TER   grade   was   analyzed   using   Case   1,   Scenario   1   (FOSM)   versus  Case  3,  Scenario  1  (AFOSM)  where  G1  =  +2%,  V1  =  140  km/hr,  and  R  =  0.25kg/kgGVM  for   both   cases.   Secondly,   two   TER   grades   were   analyzed   using   Case   2,   Scenario   1   (FOSM)   versus   Case  4,  Scenario  1  (AFOSM)  where  G1  =  0%,  G2  =  +4%,  V1  =  140  km/hr,  and  R  =  0.25kg/kgGVM   for  both  cases.  The  comparisons  are  plotted  on  the  graphs  in  Figure  26  and  Figure  27.   Figure   26   and   Figure   27   makes   it   evident   that   the   method   used   to   assess   a   TER   design   significantly   affects   the   supply   length   of   the   TER.   The   FOSM   analysis   produces   a   shorter   TER   design  supply  length  in  comparison  to  the  AFOSM  analysis.  This  is  because  the  AFOSM  analysis   is  a  more  accurate  reliability  method  and  uses  iterations  to  reduce  error  created  in  the  FOSM   model.  For  example,  for  a  CV  =  25%  for  Case  1,  Scenario  1  versus  Case  3,  Scenario  1,  the  TER   supply   length   is   267.1   m   longer,   or   41%   greater   using   the   AFOSM   analysis   in   comparison   to   the   FOSM  analysis.   To  further  compare  the  FOSM  and  AFOSM  models,  the  AFOSM  model  was  tested  using  the  Pf   and   Lsupply   values   obtained   in   the   FOSM   reliability   analysis.   For   all   cases,   the   AFOSM   model   yielded   an   identical   response   to   that   obtained   using   the   FOSM   model   after   one   iteration.   However,   upon   further   iteration,   the   probability   of   failure   increased   for   the   same   Lsupply,   implying  that  the  initial  value  obtained  from  the  FOSM  model  has  a  higher  probability  of  failure   than  initially  assumed.

As  a  result,  the  AFOSM  method  is  highly  recommended  for  a  more  accurate  design.  However,   space   constraints   may   be   of   concern   and   designers   should   perform   a   benefit   cost   analysis   to   determine   how   accurate   of   an   analysis   is   required   in   order   to   optimize   safety   while   creating   an   economical  design.

Application  

Since  a  FOSM  and  AFOSM  reliability  analysis  has  never  been  performed  for  the  design  of  TERs,   the  models  developed  in  this  study  were  applied  to  existing  one  grade  and  two  grade  TERs  in   order  to  assess  the  reliability  of  existing  TERs  in  practice.  

6.1  

Arrestor  Bed  Single  Ascending  Grade:  I-17  NB  

A   single   ascending   grade   arrestor   bed   TER   exists   on   Arizona's   Interstate   17   NB   (I-17   NB).   The   present   conditions   of   this   TER   include   pea   gravel   bedding   material   with   a   2%   upgrade   [17].   The   I-17   NB   TER   consists   of   a   445   m   exit   ramp   terminal   and   a   335   m   of   arrestor   bed,   for   a   total   TER   length  of  780  m  [17].  Between  1986  through  2001,  this  TER  has  been  used  51  times  [17].   The   FOSM   and   AFOSM   reliability   analyses   were   applied   to   Arizona's   I-17.   This   application   is   identical   to   the   analysis   completed   in   Case   1,   Scenario   1,   and   Case   3,   Scenario   1.   Since   a   design   speed  was  not  provided,  140  km/hr  was  assumed  for  this  analysis.  When  comparing  the  results   from   the   existing   I-17   NB   TER   design   to   the   FOSM   and   AFOSM   reliability   analyses,   the   probability   of   failure   for   all   CV   values   is   smaller   than   1%,   with   the   exception   of   the   AFOSM   analysis  when  CV  =  25%,  in  which  case,  the  probability  of  failure  is  roughly  2.5%.  For  higher  CV   values,  the  probability  of  failure  will  increase,  and  for  lower  CV  values,  the  probability  of  failure   will  decrease.  Overall  this  TER  design  has  a  low  probability  of  failure.

Arrestor  Bed  Multiple  Descending  Grades:  KY  118  

A   two   grade   descending   arrestor   bed   TER   exists   on   Kentucky's   Route   118   (KY   118)   located   in   Leslie  County.  The  present  conditions  of  this  TER  include  pea  gravel  bedding  material  with  a  -8%   downgrade  followed  by  a  4%  downgrade  [18].  The  total  length  of  the  I-17  NB  TER  is  275  m  long   89  

  

  

and   consists   of   117   m   paved   section   followed   by   158   m   of   arrestor   bed   [18].   Between   1980   through  1985,  this  TER  has  been  used  4  times  in  emergency  situations,  resulting  in  little  damage   to  the  vehicle  and  no  reported  injury  [18].

6.2.3   FOSM  &  AFOSM  Discussion  
When   comparing   the   results   from   the   existing   design   to   the   FOSM   and   AFOSM   reliability   analyses,   the   length   of   the   existing   KY   118   TER   does   not   meet   acceptable   criteria   as   the   probability   of   failure   exceeds   15%   for   all   CV.   Furthermore,   the   supplied   TER   length   does   not   meet  the  design  standard  described  in  Section  2.5.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  TER  was   installed   in   1980   and   could   have   used   less   conservative   standards   or   an   alternate   method   to   determine   the   required   TER   design   length.   In   addition,   a   smaller   design   speed,   higher   rolling   resistance,   or   a   combination   of   both,   may   have   been   used,   resulting   in   a   shorter   required   stopping  distance.  Overall  according  to  the  FOSM  and  AFOSM  reliability  methods  discussed  in   this  paper,  this  design  is  considered  unreliable  until  more  information  is  obtained  regarding  the   exact  design  details.   92

The  results  of  this  study  demonstrate  that  many  factors  can  affect  the  design  and  reliability  of  a   TER.  Varying  conditions  such  as  a  change  in  grade,  entering  vehicle  speed,  and  rolling  resistance   all  contribute  to  the  final  design  length  for  a  given  TER.     In   regards   to   the   reliability   analysis,   it   is   clear   that   shorter   TERs   yield   a   higher   probability   of   failure   as   the   runaway   vehicle   does   not   have   as   much   available   distance   to   safely   stop.   In   particular,  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  critical  design  area,  between  1%  to  5%,  since  the  TER   supply  length  decreases  and  tapers  off  once  the  probability  of  failure  exceeds  5%.  For  example,   in   Case   1,   Scenario   1,   CV   =   25%   (FOSM   Reliability   Analysis,   G1   =   +2%,   V1   =   140   km/hr,   R   =   0.25kg/kgGVM),  the  required  TER  supply  length  increased  by  up  to  20%.   The   variation   of   the   design   variables   also   affects   the   TER   supply   length   where   a   larger   coefficient  of  variation  requires  a  larger  TER  supply  length.  For  example,  in  Case  1,  Scenario  1,   the   TER   supply   length   for   CV   =   25%   is   81.5%   greater   than   CV   =   1%.   Furthermore,   in   Case   1,   Scenario   1,   the   change   in   TER   supply   length   over   a   range   of   Pf   =   1%   to   Pf   =   15%   is   a   12.8%   difference  for  CV  =  5%  and  a  45.3%  difference  for  a  CV  =  25%.   Furthermore,   the   higher   the   speed   of   a   runaway   vehicle   entering   the   TER,   the   longer   the   required   TER   supply   length.   For   example,   for   a   CV   =   25%,   the   TER   supply   length   increases   by   96%,  for  a  vehicle  travelling  140  km/hr  (Case  1,  Scenario  1)  in  comparison  to  a  vehicle  travelling   100  km/hr  (Case  1,  Scenario  3).   Similarly,   a   negative   grade   yields   a   higher   probability   of   failure   as   gravity   is   working   with   the   runaway   vehicle,   prohibiting   the   vehicle   from   safely   stopping   in   a   shorter   distance.   For   example,   for   a   CV   =   25%,   the   TER   supply   length   is   127.5   m   longer,   or   19.6%   greater,   for   a   93  

  

  

vehicle   travelling   downgrade   at   G   =   -2%   (Case   1,   Scenario   9)   in   comparison   to   a   vehicle   travelling  upgrade  at  G  =  +2%  (Case  1,  Scenario  1).   Lastly,  it  is  clear  that  the  AFOSM  reliability  method  is  more  accurate  than  the  FOSM  reliability   method   and   yields   a   larger   TER   length   for   all   cases.   This   is   because   the   AFOSM   analysis   is   a   more   accurate   reliability   method   due   to   the   nature   of   the   methodology   which   considers   analysis   at   design   points.   The   AFOSM   reliability   method   provides   the   designer   with   a   more   conservative   value   for   the   design   length   of   a   TER   which   is   useful   to   ensure   safety   and   a   low   probability  of  failure.  For  example,  for  a  CV  =  25%  for  Case  1,  Scenario  1  versus  Case  3,  Scenario   1,  the  TER  supply  length  is  41%  greater  using  the  AFOSM  analysis  in  comparison  to  the  FOSM   analysis.   In  conclusion,  the  range  in  values  is  significant  for  all  factors  affecting  the  required  TER  supply   length.   The   design   variables   should   be   optimized   in   order   to   produce   a   cost   effective   design   while  ensuring  user  safety  as  a  top  priority.
