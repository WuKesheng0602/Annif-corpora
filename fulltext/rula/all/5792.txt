ABSTRACT
ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF STRONTIUM, LEAD AND ALUMINUM ON DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY AND QUANTITATIVE ULTRASOUND MEASUREMENTS USING TRABECULAR BONE-MIMICKING PHANTOMS

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard of bone densitometry. However, inaccurate estimation of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is of concern when calcium in bone mineral is partially substituted with bone-seeking elements such as strontium, lead and aluminum. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is an alternative bone densitometry technique that can assess bone health based on the measurement of acoustic parameters. This study aims to

investigate the effect of the clinically relevant concentrations of bone-seeking elements on aBMD measured by DXA and the acoustic parameters measured by QUS, using trabecular bonemimicking phantoms. Statistically significant linear relationship was observed between aBMD and strontium concentration. For clinically relevant concentrations of lead and aluminum, the deviation in aBMD measurements was within 1% coefficient of variation of DXA. No statistically significant deviation was observed in stiffness index measurement by QUS in the presence of any of the three bone-seeking elements.

1.2 Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a bone metabolic disorder characterized by the loss of bone mass and degeneration of bone microarchitecture.(1) It is caused by bone remodeling imbalance due to shift of the equilibrium between bone reformation and reabsorption toward the later.(2) Consequently, osteoporosis increases the risk of fragility fractures that occur with little or no apparent trauma, especially at sites such as hip, spine and wrists.(3) Osteoporosis has considerable public health implication as fractures associated with osteoporosis has significant negative impact on quality of life, and increases morbidity and mortality.(4) Osteoporosis is most prevalent among, but not limited to, post-menopausal women. In Canada, it is estimated that approximately 1 in 4 women and 1 in 8 men have osteoporosis.(5) It is

1

a major public health concern in Canada and worldwide, as the prevalence of osteoporosis is expected to rise steeply over next few decades due to the increase in overall life expectancy. (5) Osteoporotic fractures incur heavy financial burden on Canadian healthcare system due to costs associated with to hospitalizations, emergency care, surgeries, rehabilitation, drugs, and productivity losses.(6) It is estimated that the economic burden of osteoporosis related fractures in Canada was $1.3 billion in 1993 and $2.3 billion in 2010.(7) osteoporosis prior to the occurrence of fracture is imperative. Therefore, the diagnosis of

1.3 Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry
Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is a diagnostic technique that uses two X-ray beams with different energies to measure areal bone mineral density (aBMD). DXA scans are most commonly performed at the lumbar spine and the proximal femur (hip), bones that are weight-bearing. In case a patient condition does not permit the examination of the two sites, the radius of the forearm can be assessed instead. DXA is the current gold standard of bone densitometry that is used to diagnose osteoporosis and evaluate the risk of fracture. The

advantages of DXA include good precision, short scan times, low radiation dose, and effective quality control and calibration.(8) X-ray beams are produced by accelerating free electrons from a heated filament toward an anode by applying electric potential. The collision of the accelerated electrons with the anode target generates poly-energetic bremsstrahlung radiation and characteristic X-ray, and the voltage across the cathode and anode determines the maximum energy of the X-ray. Two approaches were adapted by DXA manufacturers to differentiate the energies of the X-ray beams: K-absorption edge filtering (e.g. in the GE Lunar Prodigy® device) and kVp switching (e.g. in the Hologic

2

Horizon® device).(9)

The K-absorption filtering method uses a metal filter to split one

polyenergetic X-ray beam into high-energy and low-energy components. The kVp switching method produces two X-ray beams with different energy spectrum by switching the tube voltage continuously. Consequentially, the effective energy of the two beams vary among the manufacturers and models. 1.3.1 Physics of X-ray Photon Attenuation The attenuation of the X-ray beams in diagnostic energy range can be attributed to photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering.(8) Photoelectric absorption is the interaction between an incident photon and a tightly bound orbital electron of an attenuating medium. In this process, the incident photon is completely absorbed by the target electron and deposits all its energy to the electron. As the result the electron is ejected from the orbital of the target atom, and it is referred to as a photoelectron. The kinetic energy Ek of the photoelectron can be obtained using the following equation:  =  -  (1.1)

where  is the incident photon energy and  is the binding energy of the orbital electron. The vacancy in the orbital created by the ejection of the electron is filled by a higher shell electron. During the process, a secondary characteristic X-ray or an Auger electron can be produced. The photoelectric attenuation coefficient is highly dependent on the atomic number Z of an attenuating medium. The photoelectric attenuation coefficient is proportional to Z4 for high Z absorbers and Z5 for low Z absorbers. Conversely, in relation to increasing photon energy the photoelectric

attenuation coefficient decreases as 1/()3. Therefore the photoelectric attenuation coefficient is approximately proportional to  4 /()3.(10)

3

Compton scattering is the interaction of an incident photon with a free orbital electron, whose binding energy  is significantly smaller than the photon energy  . Upon the collision of the photon with the free electron, the photon transfers part of its energy to the electron, allowing it to scatter, and the photon is scattered with diminished energy. The energy of the scattered photon  can be calculated from the equation:

  =


 1+ (1-)  2

(1.2)

where  is the incident photon energy,   2 is the electron rest energy (0.511 MeV), and  is the angle between the incident photon and scattered photon. The scattering photon has highest energy when  = 0 , and the lowest energy when  =  (backscatter). Higher initial photon energy increase the probability of the forward scatter. The Compton atomic attenuation coefficient is proportional to the electron density which in turn is dependent on Z. However it is important to note that the mass attenuation coefficient for Compton scattering does not depend on Z due to the normalization of the density.(10) The Compton atomic attenuation coefficient decreases with increasing energy. The total attenuation coefficient is the sum of attenuation coefficients for all photon interaction with a medium. Rayleigh scattering also known as coherent scattering, and pair production are other modes of photon interaction with a matter. However, the two modes of photon interactions hold little or no significance for DXA. The attenuation coefficient for Rayleigh scattering, which does not transfer any energy to a charged particle, is significantly lower than that of photoelectric absorption or Compton scattering. In addition, pair production requires photon energy above 2  2 (1.022 MeV) in order to produce an electron and a positron, and the photon energy relevant to DXA is below the threshold energy of photoelectric effect. Therefore,

attenuation coefficient for photoelectric effect and Compton scattering determines the total 4

attenuation coefficient.

Since the attenuation coefficients of photoelectric absorption and

Compton effect are Z dependent, bone with higher effective Z than soft tissue consequentially have higher total attenuation coefficient. In addition, although the mass attenuation coefficient of Compton effect is Z independent, bone has higher mass attenuation coefficient than soft tissue mainly due to high Z dependency of photoelectric effect. In practice, attenuation of photon can be evaluated using the ratio of the original intensity of an incident beam and the measured intensity of a beam transmitted through a medium. Attenuation of mono-energetic beam through a medium can be expressed using the following equation:  = 0  - (1.3)

where 0 is the intensity of original incident beam,  is the intensity of the beam transmitted,  is the thickness of the medium (in cm), and  is the attenuation coefficient (in cm-1) specific to the medium and the energy of the beam. The above equation can be re-written using the mass attenuation coefficient, which takes the mass density of the medium into account.  = 0 
 -( )

In Equation 1.4,  denotes mass attenuation coefficient of the medium (in cm2/g), and  denotes the mass density of the medium (in g/cm3). The product of the mass density  and the thickness  yield the areal density denoted as M (in g/cm2). Assuming that the photon is passing through bone and soft tissue, Equation 1.4(9) can be written as: I = 0 
-{[( )

It is important to note that the derivation of the above equations are simplified based on monochromatic beam approximation, more suited for Dual Photon Absorptiometry (DPA) that uses two mono-energetic beams originated from a radionuclide source.(9) In reality, DXA emits two poly-energetic beams with different maximum energy. The poly-energetic nature of the beams is because the primary mode of X-ray production is via bremsstrahlung. Therefore, to take this into account, Equation 1.3 needs to be re-written using energy dependent intensity I0(E) as given by:  =  0 () -()  (1.10)

1.3.2 Diagnostic Role of DXA There is a systematic variation in measurement readings obtained from the same subject using DXA scanners from different manufacturers. This is because, among other things, DXA scanners from different manufacturers use different analysis algorithm, region of interest (ROI) definitions, calibration protocol and effective photon energies.(12) Therefore, direct comparison among aBMD measurements obtained using different devices cannot be made. There has been efforts to standardize aBMD and BMC measurements among the manufactures, initiated by the International Committee for Standards in Bone Measurement (ICSBM), to remove the measurement difference among manufacturers using a correction formula.(13) However, clinical application of standardization to compare results of an individual patients was not recommended due to the standard error associated with the correction.(14) Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis largely relies on T-score and Z-score derived from aBMD. The T-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a young healthy reference population.(15) Derivation of T-score can be represented using Equation 1.11 where  denotes T-score,  denotes an individual result,   denotes the mean of the reference population, and SDr denotes the standard deviation of the reference population distribution:  =
     -  

(1.11)

Similarly, Z-score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for an individual's age, sex and ethnicity. For the screening purpose, Osteoporosis Society of Canada recommends aBMD assessment to individuals over age of 65, or to younger adults with identifiable risk factors that increases the susceptibility to bone loss.(16) The risk factors include history of fragility fracture, hypogonadism, use of high-risk medications, hyperparathyroidism, high alcohol consumption and smoking. 7

Traditionally the diagnosis of osteoporosis was based on the diagnostic criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO), which defines osteoporosis as aBMD T-score below 2.5.(17) For individuals under age of 50, Z-score with a threshold of -2.0 is used to determine if aBMD result is within or below the expected range for age. More detailed fracture risk evaluation systems, which account for the other risk factors in addition to T-score, have been adapted by Osteoporosis Canada (OC) recently in order to better reflect the complex nature of the fracture risk(16): Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada (CAROC) system and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) of the WHO calibrated for Canadian population.

1.4 Quantitative Ultrasound
Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is a bone densitometry technique that assesses bone health by measuring ultrasonic parameters. The main advantages of QUS over DXA include its portability, relatively low cost and absence of exposure to ionizing radiation.(18) QUS measurements are commonly taken at the calcaneus using transverse transmission technique to obtain broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS). The calcaneus is desired site of examination because it is a weight bearing bone composed mainly of trabecular bone, and has flat and parallel medial and lateral surface ideal for coupling of two transducers.(19) The transverse transmission system consists of two ultrasound transducers placed on opposite sides, where one functions as a transmitter and another functions as a receiver. There are two designs of QUS available for the transverse transmission technique: a water-based system and a dry contact system.(15) The first clinical devices developed were water-based system. For this system, the heel is immersed in water and placed between two transducers.(15) Dry contact design was later developed and it tend to replace water-based system; it has easier portability, better hygiene and

8

higher precision as water temperature has significant impact on ultrasonic parameters.(15) The two transducers in dry system are mechanically driven to maintain constant pressure in direct contact with the heel. 1.4.1 Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation Similar to photon attenuation, ultrasound attenuation involves decrease in the intensity of ultrasound wave with respect to increasing the wave propagation distance. Absorption and scattering are the two main mechanisms that contribute to ultrasonic attenuation.(15) During absorption process, ultrasound energy is converted into other forms of energy such as heat, chemical energy and light. Scattering of ultrasound represents redirection of ultrasound wave along paths that differ from the incident wave. Because scattering phenomena is the interaction between ultrasound wave and boundaries of heterogeneous particles, there would be no scattering for pure fluids for which attenuation and absorption become identical.  0), then intensity of the ultrasound wave If the original ultrasound incident intensity is  ( after passing an attenuating medium with thickness  can be represented as:  ) =  (  0) -2( +) =  (  0) -2  ( (1.12)

where  is amplitude attenuation, which is the sum of absorption amplitude attenuation coefficient,  , and scattering amplitude attenuation coefficient,  . The amplitude attenuation coefficient is frequency, temperature and pressure dependent. The unit of the attenuation coefficient is cm-1, but in practice Nepers per centimeter (Np/cm) or decibel per cm (dB/cm) is used. The conversion between Np/cm and dB/cm is  = 8.686 or  = 0.1151 .(15) The attenuation

coefficient in dB/cm can be written in terms of intensity or pressure ratios using following equations:  =

(1.14)

Attenuation is calculated as   using Equation 1.14, where  (0) is the pressure measured without the calcaneus, and  () is the pressure measured with the calcaneus with thickness of  in place. A quasi-linear relationship between ultrasonic attenuation and frequency has been observed for bone between frequency range of 0.2 to 2 MHz.(19) Based on this relationship, BUA (with units of dB/MHz) is determined by taking the slope of the linear regression of attenuation and frequency. BUA is often normalized by the thickness in order to evaluate thickness

independent attenuation coefficient rather than total attenuation. However, BUA is used in clinical practice because normalized BUA measurement does not show significant improvement in fracture discrimination.(20) Typically, the clinical QUS systems use the frequency range of 0.2 to 0.6MHz to evaluate BUA.(21) BUA provides good assessment of bone mass as strong correlation has been observed between BMD and BUA. Laugier and colleagues observed statistically significant relationship between normalized BUA and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) with R2 of 0.8 and pvalue less than 10-4 upon the measurement of the excised trabecular bone from the calcaneus using a water-based QUS system.(22) Wide range of BUA values has been reported in studies of the human calcaneus. In study by Portero and colleagues, which assessed the excised calcaneus using Hologic Sahara® QUS device, reported average BUA of 38.2 dB/MHz with wide range of BUA observed between 0.3 and 80.1 dB/MHz.(23) In study by Bouxsein and colleagues, which evaluated the calcaneus from intact feet of cadavers using Hologic UBA575+® QUS device, average BUA of 53.6 dB/MHz with BUA range of 8.0 to 92.5 dB/MHz were observed.(24) The observed difference between the two studies

10

can be attributed to the difference in the QUS systems used for the assessment, and the difference in the calcaneus condition (ex vivo calcaneus vs. calcaneus from intact feet).

(a) Placement of transducers in the mediolateral direction, (b) substitution method of assessing BUA, (c) difference in the amplitude signal obtained from the reference medium (solid line) and through the heel (dashed line), (d) difference in the amplitude spectra of the reference signal (solid line) and of the signal transmitted through the heel (dashed line) (e) frequency dependent attenuation(15) 1.4.2 Speed of Sound Speed of sound is a characteristic of a medium, which depends on the material and geometric properties and temperature of the medium. Generally, speed of sound, , can be derived from an

11

effective elastic modulus  and effective mass density  as per Equation 1.15. The effective elastic modulus and effective mass density account for different wave types such as bulk compression, bulk shear, surface or guided wave.(19)  =   




(1.15)

However, the derivation of  for the bone is complex and requires cumbersome theoretical developments. It is because the bone is a highly heterogeneous medium containing a mixture of components such as collagen fibers, hydroxyapatite crystals, water, and bone marrow which have different elastic coefficients.(15) Furthermore, because the pore size (~500 to 1000 m) of the trabecular bone is comparable to the wavelength (1.5 mm at 500 kHz), the trabecular bone cannot be approximated to be homogeneous.(15) QUS systems evaluate SOS based on time of flight (TOF) measurements. TOF represents the time delay between the initial transmission of ultrasound from one transducer and reception by another. For the water-based system, two TOF measurements are taken in order to derive SOS. Initially, TOF of an ultrasound pulse without a sample is measured through a reference medium (water) with length L between the two transducers. TOF of the reference medium can be expressed using L and the temperature dependent speed of sound, cref, in the reference medium:   =  


(1.16)

Then TOF of ultrasound with a sample of thickness x in between the transducer is then measured as:  =   + 
- 

(1.17)

The difference of TOF in the two conditions can be written as:  =  -   =
 

-  



(1.18)

12

Based on Equation 1.18, SOS in the target sample can be calculated as:  =
1
1  (  )+( )  

(1.19)

In case of a dry contact QUS system, whose transducers are in direct contact with the sample, SOS is derived by dividing mechanically measured thickness x with TOF.  = 


(1.20)

Similar to BUA, SOS exhibits strong correlation with bone mass density. In the study by Laugier and colleagues on the excised trabecular bone of the calcaneus, statistically significant relationship between SOS and vBMD was reported (R2 = 0.84, and p < 10-4).(22) In addition, statistically significant relationship was observed between normalized BUA and SOS as well (R2 = 0.88, and p < 10-4). The mean SOS in bone measured by Portero and colleagues is 1571 m/s (1412 ­ 1746 m/s) for the excised calcaneus,(24) and mean value measured by Bouxsein and colleagues is 1512 m/s (1480 ­ 1570 m/s) for the intact foot. 1.4.3 Stiffness Index Stiffness index (SI), also known as quantitative ultrasound index (QUI), is an empirical parameter derived from the combination of BUA and SOS. It is important that the term SI should not be confused with the mechanical stiffness of bone. The empirical derivation of SI is specific to each device and the rationale for the specific derivation equation remains proprietary to the manufacturer. The equation used by GE Lunar Achilles® and Hologic Sahara® QUS devices to derive SI can be expressed as Equation 1.21(25) and 1.22,(26) respectively. SI = 0.67 × (BUA) + 0.28 × (SOS) - 420 SI = 0.41 × (BUA + SOS) - 571 (1.21) (1.22)

SI has been reported to produce better precision than using BUA or SOS alone, because it compensates for both variation in calcaneal thickness and temperature.(27) Xu and colleagues 13

observed significantly positive correlation between calcaneal SI and total body aBMD (R2 = 0.693, p < 0.001).(28) To facilitate direct comparison with DXA, SI can be converted to give estimated aBMD based on SI T-score.(29)

1.5 Bone Seeking Elements
Bone-seeking elements are class of chemical elements that are incorporated into crystalline bone matrix with extended residence, whose whole-body kinetic behavior is determined by the balance among excretion, bone uptake and release from bone.(30) Bone-seeking elements such as strontium, lead, aluminum, uranium and barium have significant physiological implication as they can alter bone tissue or its growth rate. 1.5.1 Strontium Strontium (Sr, Z =38) is an alkaline earth metal positioned directly one row under calcium in the periodic table. It holds clinical significance due to its role as a medication for osteoporosis treatment. Strontium renalate is orally administered drug licensed for the treatment of

postmenopausal osteoporosis in Europe and Australia.(31) Although strontium ranelate is not yet approved for the medicinal use in the United States or Canada, other forms of strontium salts such as strontium citrate and strontium carbonate are commercially available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements.(32) The therapeutic effect of increase in bone mass observed from the intake of strontium medication is due to its dual effect on bone remodelling: promotion of bone formation and inhibition of bone reabsorption.(33) The promotion of bone formation is achieved by anabolic effect of increasing pre-osteoblast replication and osteoblast differentiation, while the inhibition of bone reabsorption is due to inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and enhanced osteoclast apoptosis.

14

The clinical efficacy of strontium treatment has been documented in large population studies such as Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention (SOTI) study(31) and Treatment of Peripheral Osteoporosis (TROPOS) study.(34) In SOTI study, aBMD increased by 14.4% and 8.3% in the lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively, after 36 months of daily intake of 2 g strontium renalate among 1648 women. Similarly, TROPOS study reported 8.2% and 9.8% increase respectively in aBMD of the femoral neck and the total hip after 3 years of daily intake of 2 g strontium renalate among 5091 women. Upon the chemical analysis of the iliac bone biopsy samples, average bone strontium content (expressed as Sr / [Sr+Ca], mol/mol%) of 1.6% was observed among patients who underwent strontium renalate treatment for three years.(35) However, the increase in aBMD measured by DXA in the presence of strontium is partially an artifact caused by increased attenuation coefficient in strontium containing bone.(36,37) Because strontium has higher attenuation coefficient than calcium in the diagnostic X-ray energy range, strontium containing bone would attenuate more photon and as the result aBMD measured by DXA is overestimated. Nielsen and colleagues(37) reported strontium overestimation factor, which is the degree of aBMD overestimation observed per 1% increase in bone strontium content, to be 10%. The overestimation can be expressed as following equation(38):  = ( × % + 1)  (1.23)

where C denotes the overestimation factor, Sr% denotes the strontium ratio. Liao and colleagues further investigated the overestimation factor and reported the variation in the overestimation factor among different DXA devices.(39) This is because the energy level of X-ray beams used by different DXA manufacturers varies, and in turn the variation in energy dependent attenuation coefficient affects the overestimation factor. Therefore, in order to accurately investigate the

15

therapeutic effect of strontium, the bone mass needs to be assessed independent from the strontium content. 1.5.2 Lead and Aluminum Lead (Pb, Z = 82) is another bone-seeking element and 90% of the body burden of lead is deposited in bone.(40) In addition to the neurotoxicity, lead cause degeneration of bone mineral and consequently, decrease in aBMD measured by DXA.(41,42) Lead inhibits both osteoblast and osteoclast activity, but the inhibitory effect is more pronounced in osteoblast than osteoclast.(43) As a result, bone reabsorption becomes more dominant than bone formation in the process of bone turnover. The major pathway of lead ingestion is occupation exposure in mines and smelters.(44,45) In addition, environmental exposure from lead piping and lead based paint contribute to the lead ingestion of general public.(46) The accumulation of lead in bone occurs in relatively low concentration in comparison to strontium, as the exposure to lead is inadvertent and not deliberate. In extreme case of an occupational exposure in Silesian district of Poland, lead concentration ranged from 20 g/g to 200 g/g bone weight.(45) Aluminum (Al, Z =13) is a toxic bone-seeking element and about 60% of the aluminum body burden is deposited in bone.(47) The toxicity of aluminum has been linked to Alzheimer's disease(48) and osteomalacia, which is softening of bone.(49) Aluminum toxicity to bone can be attributed to its inhibitory effects on osteoblastic activity, which results in diminished collagen synthesis and matrix mineralization.(49) Aluminum can be introduced into human body via occupational exposure(48) and aluminum containing medication or parenteral nutrition.(50­52) Furthermore, chronic exposure to aluminum via consumption of food and consumer products is of concern.(53,54) Similar to lead, the concentration of aluminum accumulated in bone is lower than

16

strontium; extreme cases of aluminum contamination among patients undergoing hemodialysis did not exceed 130 g/g.(55) Because lead is a highly attenuating element, elevation of aBMD due to lead is of a potential concern.(43,56) Two distinct studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of lead on aBMD measured by DXA. Puzas and colleagues examined pulverized bovine bone doped with lead using a pencil beam DXA device (Lunar DPX-L® ) and observed 4 to 11% increase in aBMD for lead concentration ranging from 10 to 100 g/g.(56) In contrast, the overestimation of aBMD was not observed in another study done by Popovic and colleagues that measured plaster of Paris phantoms doped with clinically relevant concentration of lead using fan beam DXA device (Hologic QDR 4500A ® ). It appears that, to date, no scientific study has investigated the effect of clinically relevant concentration of aluminum on aBMD.

1.6 Bone-Mimicking Phantoms
Various models of trabecular bone-mimicking phantoms for QUS systems have been proposed previously. Clarke and colleagues(57) developed an epoxy resin based phantom and the porosity of the trabecular bone was simulated using granules of porcine gelatin that mimics bone marrow. This model of phantom is often called the Leeds phantom. Hodgskinson and

colleagues(58) developed a phantom made of a Perspex block, where a symmetrical array of holes were introduced to simulate the porosity of the trabecular bone; the number of the holes were kept constant and the porosity was controlled by changing the size of the holes. For both models of bone-mimicking phantom, non-linear parabolic relationship was observed between BUA and the porosity.(57,58) In addition, Tatarinov and colleagues(59) further modified the Leeds phantom with porosity simulation using soft rubber particles instead of gelatin granules, and imitated bone

17

mineral content by adding the mineral residue of natural bone obtained by grinding and burning. Other models that have been proposed for trabecular bone-mimicking phantom include aluminum foams,(60) nylon filaments suspended in soft-tissue mimicking material(61) and Polyacetal cuboid with cylindrical pores.(62) Da Silva and colleagues developed protocols for the synthesis of pure hydroxyapatite phantom free of strontium or lead contamination(63) and for the synthesis of strontium substituted hydroxyapatite phantom with high strontium concentrations.(64) Rizivi and colleagues(65,66)

developed a QUS compatible trabecular bone-mimicking phantom made of the hydroxyapatite synthesized using the above methods; the hydroxyapatite phantoms are finely milled and mixed with gelatin medium homogeneously. The gelatin based bone-mimicking phantom is housed in an acrylic box and is submerged in castor oil that mimics soft tissues overlying the calcaneus. SOS and BUA measured from the multi-layer bone-mimicking phantom were similar to the acoustic parameters measured from the ex vivo trabecular bone from the human calcaneus.(23)

1.7 Hypothesis and Specific Aims
DXA technique, which is the current gold standard of bone densitometry, relies on X-ray attenuation to measure BMD. Consequently, the presence of bone-seeking elements such as strontium, aluminum and lead could cause systematic error in DXA-based BMD measurements. In contrast, QUS technique measures BMD based on bone's macroscopic acoustic properties, which are not influenced by microscopic changes in the atomic composition of the bone. Therefore, it is hypothesized that QUS measurements of BMD would remain independent of concentration of these bone-seeking elements. This study aims to investigate the effect of clinically relevant concentrations of strontium, lead and aluminum on DXA and QUS bone

18

densitometry measurements using custom-designed bone-mimicking phantoms. The specific aims of this study are:  Producing bone-mimicking phantoms compatible with DXA and QUS systems that contain known concentrations of strontium, lead and aluminum, while maintaining constant vBMD.  Verifying that the bone-mimicking phantoms correctly reproduce the acoustic parameters measured from the calcaneus and yield desired aBMD under DXA measurements.

Purpose: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard technique to measure areal bone mineral density (aBMD) for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Because DXA relies on the attenuation of photon to predict aBMD, deposition of bone-seeking elements such as strontium, lead and aluminum that differ in atomic numbers from calcium can cause inaccurate estimation of aBMD. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS), is another technique available to assess bone health by

21

measuring broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS) and an empirically derived quantity called stiffness index (SI). Because the acoustic properties are not prone to significant change due to microscopic changes in the atomic composition of bone, it is hypothesized that QUS is unaffected by the presence of bone-seeking elements in bone. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of strontium, lead and aluminum on aBMD measured by DXA and the acoustic parameters measured by QUS using trabecular bonemimicking phantoms compatible with both techniques. Methods: Trabecular bone-mimicking phantoms were produced by homogeneously mixing finely powdered hydroxyapatite compounds that contain varying concentrations of strontium, lead or aluminum with porcine gelatin solution. Seven strontium-substituted phantoms were produced with varying molar ratio of Sr/(Sr+Ca) ranging from 0 to 2%. Four lead-doped phantoms and four aluminum-doped phantoms were constructed with the respective analyte concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 ppm. An additional 0 ppm phantom was produced to be used as a baseline for the lead and aluminum phantom measurements. All phantoms had uniform volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of 200 mg/cm3, and were assessed using a Hologic Horizon® DXA device, a Hologic Sahara® QUS device, and an in-house research QUS system. Results: Direct linear relationship was found between aBMD measured by DXA and strontium concentration (p < 0.001). From the measurement of lead and aluminum using DXA, statistically significant negative relationship (p = 0.016, r = -0.347 and p < 0.001, r = -0.549, respectively) were observed between aBMD and the analyte concentrations. No statistically significant change in measured SI values with respect to the concentration of all three elements was observed, for both the clinical and research QUS systems.

22

Conclusion: aBMD measured by DXA is prone to overestimation in the presence of strontium, but acoustic parameters measured by QUS are independent of strontium concentration. The deviation in aBMD induced by lead concentration under 200 ppm and aluminum concentration under 100 ppm cannot be detected using Hologic Horizon® DXA device, as the changes were within 1% coefficient of variation of the device. Furthermore, the SI measured by the QUS systems are not affected by lead or aluminum concentrations used in this study.

2.1 Introduction
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the current gold standard method for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and the monitoring of treatment progress.(17) DXA estimates areal bone mineral density (aBMD) by measuring the transmission ratio of two X-ray beams with different photon energies.(9) The mass attenuation coefficient, which in turn determines the transmission ratio of the two beams, is energy and atomic number dependent. Therefore, change in the atomic composition of bone results in change in the overall mass attenuation of the tissue.(36) One of the main limitations of DXA is that deposition of bone-seeking elements, which differ in atomic numbers from calcium (Ca, Z=20), can cause inaccurate estimation of aBMD.(36) A Bone-seeking element can be defined as any element that is readily incorporated into bone with extended residence time by substituting calcium.(30) Examples of bone-seeking elements are strontium, lead, aluminum, radium, uranium and barium. Elements that have a higher atomic number than calcium, such as strontium (Sr, Z=38) and lead (Pb, Z=82), have higher mass

23

attenuation coefficients than calcium at photon energy level relevant for DXA. Therefore, such elements are expected to increase photon attenuation in bone and result in the overestimation of aBMD.(36) In contrast, it is anticipated that elements such as aluminum (Al, Z=13), which have lower mass attenuation coefficients than calcium, may cause underestimation of aBMD as assessed by DXA. Strontium is a bone-seeking element of clinical importance, as strontium ranelate is used as an orally administered medication to treat osteoporosis(31) presently approved in Europe and Australia. Although strontium ranelate is not licenced in the United States or Canada, other strontium salts such as strontium citrate and strontium carbonate is commercially available as an over-the-counter nutritional supplement.(32) Strontium has the therapeutic effect of increasing bone mass by stimulating osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclasts.(33) Moreover, reduction in the risk of fracture among postmenopausal women has been reported by the Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention (SOTI)(31) and Treatment of Peripheral Osteoporosis (TROPOS) trials.(34) However, in addition to the inherent therapeutic effect of strontium, the increase in aBMD is partially due to the increase in photon attenuation.(38) The overestimation of aBMD due to strontium has been demonstrated by several in vitro studies involving DXA measurements of hydroxyapatite with partial strontium substitution.(36,37,39) The study by Nielsen et al. demonstrated approximately 10% aBMD overestimation for 1 mol/mol% of Sr/(Sr+Ca).(37) Contrary to the therapeutic effect of strontium, lead and aluminum are toxic elements that may cause degeneration of the bone matrix.(41,42,49,67) The pathways of lead intake include occupational exposure in industry,(41,45) and environmental exposure from lead pipes and lead based paint.(46) Aluminum can be introduced to the human body through occupational exposure, and historically it tended to be introduced through the ingestion of aluminum-based medications

24

for renal failure.(50,52) However, concentrations of the two elements observed in bone tends to be significantly lower than that of strontium, due to the toxicity of lead and aluminum.(45,47,55) To date, there are two studies(43,56) investigating the effect of low levels of lead on aBMD in two different samples: each with conflicting results. Puzas and colleagues measured aBMD of pulverized bovine bone doped with lead and observed 4 ­ 11% overestimation for lead concentration ranging from 10 to 100 g lead/g bone.(56) In contrast, Popovic and colleagues(43) measured aBMD of plaster of Paris bone phantoms doped with lead and observed no statistically significant aBMD deviation. To date, it appears that the effect of aluminum on aBMD has not yet been demonstrated by scientific studies. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is a relatively inexpensive, portable and non-ionizing technique(18) that offers an alternative means of assessing bone health. Conventional clinical QUS devices measure broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) at the calcaneus bone site. Stiffness index (SI), an empirically defined quantity established to

compensate for the variation in the calcaneal thickness and temperature,(27) is derived from the linear combination of the two acoustic parameters. Clinical studies have demonstrated moderately positive correlation for aBMD measured at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck, with SOS, BUA and SI measured by calcaneal QUS.(28,68­71) Consequently, calcaneal QUS can effectively identify postmenopausal women at risk of bone fracture.(72,73) Our research group has previously developed a bone-mimicking phantom by synthesizing pure hydroxyapatite without contamination of strontium and lead(63) and hydroxyapatite with controlled substitution of strontium.(64) More recently, Rizvi and colleagues(65,66) further

developed a trabecular bone-mimicking phantom for QUS measurements, by suspending the finely powdered hydroxyapatite homogeneously in gelatinous medium.

25

The objective of this study was to investigate if the presence of clinically relevant concentrations of strontium, lead or aluminum in bone induce statistically significant deviation in DXA and QUS bone constructed measurements. The bone-mimicking phantoms with uniform volumetric bone mineral densities (vBMD) were constructed using hydroxyapatite with varying concentrations of strontium, lead or aluminum and were measured using Hologic Horizon® DXA device, Hologic Sahara® QUS device and an in-house research QUS system.

2.2 Materials and Methods
2.2.1 Hydroxyapatite-based trabecular bone-mimicking phantom The hydroxyapatite bone phantoms were prepared using the method developed by Da Silva and colleagues.(63,64) The strontium-substituted hydroxyapatite bone phantoms were produced by mixing CaHPO4·2H2O, Ca(OH)2 and Sr(OH)2·8H2O, while maintaining a constant (Ca+Sr)/P molar ratio of 1.67 and thus producing a mineral phase with the formula of Ca5-xSrx(PO4)3OH.(64) The hydroxyapatite bone phantoms doped with lead or aluminum were synthesized by mixing CaHPO4·2H2O and Ca(OH)2 with constant Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67 and adding 1000 g/mL lead or aluminum standard solution to the mixture in the liquid phase to achieve desired concentration of the analytes. The phantoms were set by adding 1M Na2HPO4 setting solution to the powdered mixture at a powder-to-liquid ratio of powder-to-liquid of 2:1. The protocol developed by Rizvi and colleagues(65,66) was used to produce the gelatin-based trabecular bone phantoms. Once the hydroxyapatite phantoms were set, they were dried to constant weight at 80 ºC and then were finely powdered using a tungsten carbide ball mill. The powdered phantoms were added to 5% w/w porcine gelatin solution to achieve a mineral density of 200 mg/cm3, similar to the mean vBMD (213 mg/cm3)(22) of trabecular bone of the calcaneus

26

measured by QCT.(22) The gelatin mixture was poured into a container with dimensions of 6.5 × 6.5 × 2.5 cm3 for molding. The phantom width of 2.5 cm was chosen to represent the thickness of the human calcaneus.(20) The container was rotated for two hours to ensure homogeneous distribution of the hydroxyapatite particles within the gelatin medium and to prevent aggregation of the particles. The phantoms were cooled down in a refrigerator at 4 ºC for 12 hours to allow solidification of the gelatin medium, and once solidified, the phantoms were removed from the container. Seven strontium-substituted phantoms were constructed with the mol/mol [Sr/(Sr+Ca)]% ranging from 0 to 2%. This range of the strontium concentrations was chosen to reflect the biologically relevant concentrations observed after prolonged intake of strontium ranelate.(74,75) For lead and aluminum, four phantoms for each element were constructed with the analyte concentration ranging from 50 to 200 ppm (mass of analyte/mass of hydroxyapatite). This range of concentration of the analytes was chosen to include the concentrations observed in extreme cases of prolonged exposure to lead(45) and aluminum.(55) An additional phantom that does not contain any analyte was constructed as a reference phantom to be used for both lead and aluminum study. Besides QUS, the trabecular bone-mimicking phantoms are compatible with DXA as well, since the atomic composition of hydroxyapatite mimics the bone mineral content of human bone. 2.2.2 DXA Measurements DXA measurements of the trabecular bone mimicking phantoms were conducted using a Hologic Horizon® device (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). Hologic Horizon® have operating potentials of 100 kVp and 140 kVp, resulting in two X-ray spectra with low and high energy. The trabecular bone-mimicking phantoms were placed in a water bath to simulate overlying soft tissue present during a human calcaneus measurement. The overall depth of the water bath was

27

maintained as 4 cm, so that the layer of water above the phantom has a height of 1.5 cm (Fig. 2.1). The 1.5 cm of overlying layer of water represents the overall thickness of the soft tissue overlying the calcaneus.(76,77) Because the Hologic Horizon® system did not have the BMD analysis protocol available for the calcaneus, the lumbar spine protocol was used for the BMD analysis of the phantoms. Each phantom was measured ten times with repositioning between measurements. The region of interest (ROI) was kept constant throughout all measurements, as the size of ROI can influence the result of BMD analysis.

2.2.3 Clinical QUS Measurement The clinical QUS measurements were performed using a Hologic Sahara® device (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). Because the two ultrasound transducers of the QUS system apply mechanical pressure that can compress and thus damage the gelatin-based phantom, a multi-layer bone phantom was developed by Rizvi and colleagues(65) to protect the gelatin-based phantom from the pressure. The phantom was housed in an acrylic box with a thin Mylar window to allow the transmission of ultrasound. The gelatin-based phantom was then submerged in castor oil to remove the air gap and to simulate the soft tissue overlying the calcaneus bone site. The thickness 28

of the castor oil layer on each side of the phantom was 0.75 cm, which represents the thickness of the soft tissue on the lateral and medial sides of the calcaneus (Fig. 2.2).(76,77)

Fig. 2.2. Schematic design of the multi-layer trabecular bone-mimicking phantom that mimics bone and overlying soft tissue at the calcaneus bone site

The multi-layer phantom was placed in between the two transducers of the Sahara® QUS device, and petroleum gel was applied on the transducers to create optimal contact with the surface of the phantom. Each constructed phantom was five times for SOS, BUA and SI with the repositioning of the phantom in between each measurement. The device-specific formula used to derive SI is given below:(26) SI = 0.41(SOS + BUA) - 571 2.2.4 In-house Research QUS Measurements An in-house research QUS system was available in our laboratory to investigate the proof of principle of QUS, and to verify the results from the clinical device.(65) The research system consisted of a transducer connected to a function generator that serves as the transmitter and another identical transducer connected to a digital oscilloscope that serves as a receiver. The 29 (2.1)

specifications for the two transducers were as following: central frequency = 1 MHz, focal length = 10.1 cm and aperture diameter = 3.0 cm. The pair of transducers were coaxially and confocally aligned to maximize the signal amplitude detected by the receiver. The transducers were

immersed in degassed and deionized water and the multi-layer phantom was placed halfway between the transducers and centred at the location of the common focal point (Fig. 2.3).

Fig. 2.3. Schematic experimental set up of the in-house research QUS system

Five measurements of BUA, SOS and SI were taken for each phantom with repositioning of the phantom in between each measurement. Attenuation of ultrasound in the multi-layer phantom was measured over the frequency range of 0.5 to 1.4 HMz. Then BUA with the units of dB/MHz was determined from the slope of the linear regression of the measured attenuation versus frequency. In order to obtain SOS, two time-of-flight (TOF) measurements of 1 MHz ultrasound signal were performed with and without the phantom. Equation 2.2 was used to calculate SOS based on the difference in time-of-flight (TOF) between the two measurements:(15) SOS =

(2.2)

where cref is the speed of sound in deionized water, which is the reference medium, and L is the thickness of the phantom, which was 4 cm. As the research QUS system does not have its own

30

formula for SI derivation, the SI value for the research system was derived from BUA and SOS values using Equation 2.1 to allow the direct comparison of the parameter with that of the clinical QUS. 2.2.5 Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS (version 23). Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the analyte concentration and the parameters measured using DXA and both QUS systems. The Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) and linear regression coefficient, which was the slope of the linear regression, were calculated for the evaluation of possible correlations. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant, thus statistical evaluations were made at the 95% level of confidence.

2.3 Results
2.3.1 Strontium Phantom Measurements Assessment of the reference phantom containing 0% strontium by the Hologic Horizon® DXA device demonstrated a satisfactory level of accuracy. Based on the phantom dimension and hydroxyapatite content, the expected measurement results for area, bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD were 42.25 cm2, 21.125 g and 0.500 g/cm2, respectively. The measured area was 45.4 ± 0.9 cm2, BMC was 20.1 ± 0.4 g, and BMD was 0.443 ± 0.001 g/cm2, resulting in the recovery of 108 ± 2%, 95 ± 2 % and 88.5 ± 0.3% respectively. An example of the DXA measurement of a gelatin-based bone phantom is displayed in Fig. 2.4, showing a homogeneous distribution of hydroxyapatite within the trabecular bone phantom. As shown in Fig. 2.5 and Table 2.1, statistically significant association with a strong positive correlation (p < 0.001 and r = 0.993) was observed between aBMD and strontium content. In

31

order to assess the degree of overestimation, the aBMD value of individual measurements were normalized by the mean aBMD value of the reference phantom (0.443 g/cm2) and subtracted by one. The linear regression between the degree of overestimation and the strontium concentration was fitted through the origin (Fig. 2.6). The degree of overestimation observed from every 1% strontium substitution of calcium was 13.5 ± 0.2% with the 95% confidence interval of 13.2 ­ 13.8 %. On the contrary, no parameter measured by the clinical or the research QUS system exhibited statistically significant relationship with the strontium concentration (Table 2.1).

2.3.2 Lead Phantom Measurements As shown in Table 2.2 and Fig. 2.7, the relationship between aBMD and lead concentration is shown to be statistically significant weak correlation (p = 0.016, r = -0.347). Similarly,

statistically significant moderate correlations have been observed in BUA measured by the clinical QUS system (p < 0.001 , r = 0.658) and research QUS system (p = 0.038 , r = -0.418). However, no statistically significant relationship was observed in SOS and SI measured by the both systems (Table 2.2). 2.3.3 Aluminum Phantom Measurements As shown in Table 2.3 and Fig. 2.8, the effect of aluminum concentration on aBMD measurement is statistically significant (p < 0.001) with moderate correlation (r = -0.549). All QUS measurements failed to show statistically significant changes (Table 2.3), except the SOS measured by the clinical system which had a significant moderate correlation (p = 0.006, r = -0.530).

2.4 Discussion
The study demonstrated that the hydroxyapatite-based trabecular bone-mimicking phantom originally designed for QUS is compatible with DXA as well. The images of the phantoms acquired for the BMD analysis indicated homogeneous distribution of the hydroxyapatite within the gelatin medium (Fig. 2.6). BMC and area were estimated with high level of accuracy (95 ± 2% and 108 ± 2% of recovery, respectively) when the reference phantom without any analyte content was assessed. The overestimation of area might be owing to the divergence of X-ray due 36

to the fan beam geometry of Hologic Horizon® device. The observed accuracy of the measurement of BMD was lower than BMC and area (88.5 ± 0.3%). However, the difference in the

overestimation factor observed in BMD and BMC was minimal, likely because the strontium content does not tend to influence the estimation of area.(37) In addition, it was verified that the phantoms mimic trabecular bone as the mean BUA and SOS values measured from the reference phantom using the clinical (3.2 ± 0.4 dB/MHz and 1495.4 ± 0.7 m/s) and research QUS systems (8.3 ± 0.2 dB/MHz and 1511.0 ± 0.2 m/s) were within reported experimental results obtained from human calcaneus. Portero and colleagues(23) assessed excised human calcaneus samples using Hologic Sahara® QUS device and observed BUA values ranging from 0.3 to 80.1 dB/MHz and SOS values ranging from 1412 to 1748 m/s. Although the measured BUA of the trabecular bone-mimicking phantom falls within the range of the reported BUA of human calcaneus, there is a significant difference between the mean value of BUA obtained from the phantom and the human calcaneus. The difference can be attributed to the lack of porous microstructure of bone matrix in the developed homogeneous bone-mimicking phantom, since BUA is not only affected by bone material but also by its microarchitecture.(78,79) However, the phantom can be considered as a good representation of human calcaneus, as a strong positive linear correlation between BUA and vBMD of the trabecular bone-mimicking phantom has been demonstrated by Rizvi and colleagues.(65,66) Upon the assessment of the strontium-substituted phantoms under DXA, a direct linear relationship was obtained between overestimation of aBMD and strontium content; a result consistent with the past studies.(36,37,39) The overestimation factor in our study was determined to be 13.5 ± 0.3% per 1% strontium substitution. Similarly, Liao and colleagues (39) reported the linear overestimation factor of 11.2% for Hologic Discovery® DXA (100/140 kVp). The potential

37

source of discrepancy in the overestimation factors between theirs and our studies could be the differences in the phantoms used. In the study by Liao and colleagues,(39) strontium phosphate was added to hydroxyapatite, due to commercial unavailability of strontium hydroxyapatite, to yield the desired molar ratio of Sr/(Sr +Ca). In our study, Ca(OH)2 is partially substituted with Sr(OH)2·8H2O for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite, and therefore the desired molar ratio of Sr/(Sr+Ca) is achieved before the synthesis. Although the exact replication of the overestimation factor was not achieved in this study, it is important to note that the purpose of the strontium phantom measurement with DXA was not to derive the overestimation factor, as it has already been established by several studies.(36,37,39) The primary focus of our study was to verify that the bone phantom is capable of reproducing the aBMD overestimation due to strontium and to allow direct comparison of DXA and QUS measurements obtained from the same phantom. No statistically significant relationship was found between strontium content and acoustic parameters measured by both the clinical Hologic Sahara® device and the research QUS systems. This suggests that QUS is capable of assessing bone health independently from the clinically relevant level of strontium in bone unlike DXA. Although the strontium overestimation factor of DXA is well established, it has had limited application in clinical practice, since the strontium content is unknown in most clinical cases. Currently, accurate measurement of bone strontium content can only be achieved by bone biopsy, which is a highly invasive technique. Non-invasive techniques such as dual photon absorptiometry (DPA)(80) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF)(32,81) have been suggested, but both techniques have not fully matured to accurately quantify the bone strontium content. Therefore, the use of QUS, which has been demonstrated to be unaffected by the overestimation due to strontium, could potentially be considered in settings where it is

38

available, as an adjunct assessment to DXA for monitoring BMD in patients on strontium medications. Prior to this study, there has been a lack of consensus on the effect of low levels of lead on aBMD measurement using DXA, as there were two distinct studies with conflicting observations; the study by Puzas and colleagues(56) reported 11% overestimation at 100 ppm, while Popovic and colleagues(43) failed to detect the reported overestimation. The findings of our study is

contradicting to the observation made by Puzas and colleagues,(56) but is consistent with the study by Popovic and colleagues.(43) Although the negative relationship is not consistent with the

hypothesized overestimation, the deviation of aBMD is within 1% coefficient of variation (CV) attributed to DXA. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deviation of aBMD is not detectable by DXA for a clinically significant level of lead. As for QUS measurements in our study, BUA was the only parameter that showed moderate correlation with statistical significance. However, it is important to note that the change in the SI values measured by both the clinical and research QUS systems, which determine the estimated aBMD, were statistically insignificant. Similar to the trend observed for lead, slight decrease in aBMD was observed with respect to the bone aluminum content. Despite the negative correlation, underestimation of aBMD caused by aluminum concentrations up to 100 ppm is under 1% CV of the DXA device. Although the aluminum concentrations up to 200 ppm were investigated in this study, the clinically relevant concentration of aluminum in bone typically does not exceed 100 ppm.(82) The exposure of patients with renal-failure to aluminum has been reduced as aluminum-based phosphate binders were replaced with calcium salts in late 1980s.(49) Aluminum was an element of interest because of its hypothesized effect on aBMD underestimation, unlike other bone-seeking elements. In order to further verify this potential underestimation, aluminum phantoms with extreme concentration

39

beyond the biologically relevant levels could be assessed. SOS values measured by Hologic Sahara® QUS device showed statistically significant negative correlation, however the SI measured by both the clinical and the research systems remained insensitive to aluminum levels.

2.5 Conclusions
This study investigated the effect of strontium, lead and aluminum on DXA and QUS bone density measurements using a trabecular bone-mimicking phantom that is compatible with both modalities. For DXA, linear increase in aBMD with respect to strontium concentration was observed, as expected, with an average overestimation factor of 13.5 ± 0.2%. In contrast, the two ultrasonic parameters measured by QUS, and SI value derived from the parameters to give estimated aBMD remained independent of strontium content. Therefore, where available, perhaps the use of QUS (BUA and SOS) in addition to DXA assessment, could help provide additional information that aids with monitoring of BMD in patients with a history of or currently on strontium medications. This could potentially aid with identifying an overestimation of patients' aBMD due to strontium content in their bone by DXA. Furthermore, the clinically relevant levels of lead or aluminum were not found to affect either aBMD measured by DXA or SI measured by QUS. The deviation of the parameters due to the clinically relevant levels of lead or aluminum would be indistinguishable from the intrinsic uncertainty associated with the two clinical modalities. Therefore, based on these results, both DXA and QUS can be used to assess the bone health of patients with elevated bone lead or aluminum levels without potential overestimation or underestimation.

CHAPTER 3:SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
3.1 Summary of the study
When bone-seeking elements such as strontium, lead and aluminum substitute calcium in bone, inaccurate estimation of aBMD by DXA is of potential concern. This phenomenon is well demonstrated by the reported overestimation of aBMD due to strontium(36,37,39), which is taken orally as medication or nutritional supplement for osteoporosis treatment. The deviation in aBMD is attributed to the difference in the mass attenuation coefficients between the incorporated boneseeking elements and calcium, which results in the change in overall attenuation of the two X-ray beams utilized in DXA technique. QUS is another bone densitometry technique, available in bone clinics, that assesses bone mass based on ultrasound parameters, which are not influenced by microscopic changes in the elemental composition of bone. This study aimed to investigate the effect of bone-seeking elements on DXA and QUS measurements using the trabecular bonemimicking phantoms recently developed in our laboratory that contain clinically relevant concentrations of strontium, lead and aluminum. In this study, the trabecular bone-mimicking phantoms that contain varying concentrations of strontium, lead or aluminum were produced with constant vBMD of 200mg/cm3, and were assessed using two clinical systems, a Hologic Horizon® DXA device and a Hologic Sahara® QUS device, as well as an in-house research QUS system developed in our laboratory. Upon the assessment of strontium containing bone-mimicking phantoms with DXA, statistically significant linear correlation (p < 0.001 and r = 0.993) between aBMD and the strontium concentration was observed. The aBMD overestimation factor was determined to be 13.5 ± 0.2% for every 1% 42

strontium substitution of calcium under DXA with statistical significance (p < 0.001). In contrast, the acoustic parameters BUA, SOS and SI obtained from both QUS devices did not show statistically significant relationship with strontium concentration. In case of the bone-mimicking phantoms containing lead or aluminum, the aBMD measurement exhibited statistically significant negative relationships with the analyte concentration (p = 0.016 and p < 0.001 respectively). However, the underestimation aBMD induced by lead concentrations under 200 ppm and aluminum concentrations under 100 ppm were within 1% CV intrinsic to a Hologic Horizon® DXA device. Therefore, it could be concluded that the deviation of aBMD due to the clinically relevant levels of lead and aluminum will be indistinguishable for the device. On the other hand, SI obtained from both QUS systems showed no statistically significant correlation with the lead or aluminum concentration in the bonemimicking phantoms. SI, which is based on the linear combination of BUA and SOS (Equation 2.1), holds the clinical significance as it is the parameter derived to yield aBMD comparable to DXA, and subsequently T-score that serves as the basis for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Since the QUS measurements are reported to be dependent on not only the bone mass but also the microarchitecture,(78,83) one of the limitations of this study is that, the developed bonemimicking phantom lacks the porous trabecular microarchitecture and the cortical bone layer. Therefore, the lack of the porosity in the phantom can contribute to the observed difference between the mean BUA measured from the phantom and the trabecular bone of the calcaneus reported from other published works.(23,24) However, despite of its current limitation, the phantom provides a lot of potential as its main constituent is hydroxyapatite similar to the human bone and therefore behaves similarly with human bone under DXA. In addition, the in-house QUS, a fully researcher controlled system, exhibited the expected results (and in line with the clinical QUS)

43

with the addition of strontium, lead or aluminum. Therefore, it supports the physical mechanisms of the ultrasound propagation through the doped bone mimicking phantoms with a constant density.

3.2

Conclusions
The study demonstrated that the developed trabecular bone-mimicking phantom is in fact

compatible with both DXA and QUS systems which allows a direct comparison of the two modalities. It can be concluded that, unlike DXA measurements, QUS is capable of assessing bone health independently without overestimation of the measured parameters in the presence of strontium. Furthermore, it was determined that the clinically relevant concentrations of lead and aluminum do not induce statistically significant deviation in the parameter aBMD measured by DXA and SI measured by QUS techniques. In case of aBMD, the observed statistically significant deviations from clinically relevant concentrations of lead and aluminum cannot be detected under DXA because the deviations are within the 1% CV of DXA.

3.3

Future Work
Although this study was successful in proving the hypothesis, it also opened up new

questions and opportunity for the future work. The first could be the verification of hypothesized effect of lead and aluminum on aBMD, which are overestimation and underestimation, respectively. This work will aim to show that the two elements can in fact cause the deviation of aBMD at higher concentration, and can be achieved by producing phantoms containing high concentration of lead and aluminum beyond the clinically relevant range present in patients.

44

Furthermore, the first generation of the developed trabecular bone-mimicking phantom can be improved to replicate the human calcaneus more accurately. As mentioned the limitation of the current phantom model is the lack of the porous microarchitecture. The simulation of porosity might be achieved by dispersing beads of material that mimics the ultrasonic property of bone marrow within the gelatin and hydroxyapatite mixture before solidification. Clarke and colleagues demonstrated a similar approach where granules of gelatin that simulated the marrow was dispersed within epoxy medium which simulated the bone.(57) Additional improvement of the bone phantoms will be to include the cortical layer present at the bone site used for the measurement. Another future step of this project should consider the axial transmission QUS technique.(84) The axial transmission QUS system is a more recently developed technique which assess SOS of the shear wave generated and propagated in the cortical layer of the bones such as the phalanx, the radius, and the tibia. The addition of the cortical layer to our current bone-mimicking phantom would be necessary to make the phantom compatible with this QUS technique. Development of the phantom compatible with the axial transmission QUS system would allow thorough investigation of this newly developed technology and its comparison with the DXA and the standard QUS techniques.

APPENDIX A: Procedure for Producing Trabecular Bonemimicking Phantoms
1. 1M HPO42- setting solution was produced by dissolving Na2HPO4 into MiliQ water 2. The strontium substituted hydroxyapatite bone phantoms were produced by mixing CaHPO4·2H2O, Ca(OH)2 and Sr(OH)2·8H2O, while keeping constant (Ca+Sr)/P molar ratio of 1.67. The 1M setting solution was added to the mixture of the powders to achieve powder-toliquid ratio of 2:1. 3. The hydroxyapatite bone phantoms doped with lead or aluminum were synthesized by mixing CaHPO4·2H2O and Ca(OH)2 with constant Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67 and adding 1000 g/mL lead or aluminum standard solution to the mixture to achieve desired concentration of the analytes. The 1M setting solution was added to the mixture of the powders to achieve a powder-to-liquid ratio of 2:1. 4. The hydroxyapatite phantoms were set to cure for two weeks. Once set, the hydroxyapatite phantoms were dried in an oven at 80ºC until there is no apparent change in weight due to the loss of water. 5. The dried phantoms were powdered in a ball mill using a rotating rate of 30 cycles/second. 6. The powdered phantoms were added to 5% w/w porcine gelatin solution and poured into an airtight container with dimensions of 6.5 × 6.5 × 2.5 cm3 7. The mixtures were rotated for two hours to ensure that a homogeneous distribution of the hydroxyapatite particles within the gelatin medium was achieved and to prevent aggregation and sedimentation of the particles. 8. The phantoms were cooled down in a refrigerator at 4ºC for 12 hours. Once the phantoms were solidified, they were removed from the container. 46
