DESIGN OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT AND NUTRIENTS RECOVERY Ashish Kumar Gupta, 2016 Department of Civil Engineering Ryerson University Abstract The objective was to design a municipal wastewater treatment plant with primary sedimentation and without primary sedimentation and then compare the savings in capital cost. The project discussed the design procures for the various units such as preliminary units, secondary units and tertiary units. The parametric cost estimation concept is utilized to arrive at the capital cost savings. The literature review includes the various methods to recover the nutrients from the wastewater. The literature review also includes various measures to be taken for performance improvement of municipal wastewater treatment plants. This project concludes that capital cost savings of about twenty percent can be achieved by not providing the primary sedimentation. Master of Engineering

1.Wastewater Treatment 1.1.Introduction

Wastewater treatment plants are designed to convert raw sewage into less polluted final

effluent, and to dispose of the solids removed in the process. It is required to determine the characteristics of the raw sewage and the statutory limits for treatment for effluent, before proceeding with the design of a treatment plant. It is necessary to obtain the approval of a

regulatory body before proceeding with construction of any wastewater treatment plant. The

regulations of the agency usually establish many of the basic design considerations. Many states have established classifications for various streams within their boundaries. These pollution material in the effluent. The "treatment standard" or the "effluent standards" are established taking into account the ability of the receiving waters to assimilate the waste and (Kumar, 2011) classifications generally establish "treatment standards" or "effluent standards" which limit the

the uses to which the receiving waters are put. (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) Periods of design for treatment plants vary. A normal design period would require treatment

units to be designed for population and sewage flows anticipated some 15 to 20 years after increases. (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) (Kumar, 2011)

completion of construction. Units are designed to be readily expandable as the population Water consumption records, where available, are a good basis for determining domestic flow In the absence of any better basis, many regulatory agencies accept a rate of 100 gallons per

rates. About 80 to 90% of domestic water consumption may be expected to reach the sewer. capita per day (gpcd). If commercial sewage flow is quite small in communities, the commercial flow is included as domestic flow. The design average flow rate is the average flow during some maximum significant period such as 4, 8, 12, or 16 hr, depending on circumstances. (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) (Kumar, 2011)

treatment works. Where only population data are available, acceptable equivalents for design million (ppm) and 0.17 lb of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) per day per capita or 200 ppm. Sewage treatment processes may be classified as "preliminary", "primary', "secondary"

usually be expected to remove 50 to 60% suspended solids and 25 to 35% BOD. Secondary and 75 to 90% BOD. Different biological process units are deployed in secondary treatment. addition to reducing some undesirable chemicals. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) 1.2.Components of Municipal Water Demand

treatment using conventional biological processes may remove up to 90% of suspended solids Tertiary or advanced treatment may be expected to remove over 95% of both BOD and SS in

The average amount of municipal water usage in this project is approximately 350 litres per capita per day (Lpcd) (Based on the water consumption for Cambridge in Ontario). Fig 1 shows the major contaminants in the wastewater and Table 1 shows the pollutants and the impacts. This amount includes residential, commercial, light industrial, firefighting, public uses, and water lost or unaccounted for including the irrigation for gardens. The fig 2 shows typical components of the wastewater from community. The Factors affecting water withdrawal rates are: 1) climate,

Water demand data is used for estimating the wastewater characteristics & quantity of water.

2) geographic location,

3) size and economic conditions of the community, 4) degree of industrialization, 5) metered water supply, (Elbeshbishy, 2016)

6) cost of water. Various components of municipal water demand are discussed below.

1.2.1.Residential Water Use:

The residential or domestic water demand is the portion of municipal water supply that is used in homes. It includes toilet flush, cooking, drinking washing, bathing, watering lawn, and other uses. 1.2.2.Commercial Water Use:

Commercial establishments include motels, hotels, office building shopping centres, service, stations, airports, and the like.

1.2.3.Industrial Water Use: the like.

Water used for industrial processes such as process water, washing, and cooling, and

1.2.4.Public Water Use:

Water used in public buildings (city halls, schools, etc.) as well as water used for public services including fire protection, street washing and public park irrigation is considering public water use.

In a water supply system there is a certain amount of water that is lost or unaccounted for because of meter and pump slippage, leaks in mains, faulty meters. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) 1.3.Quality of Wastewater:

Municipal wastewater contains over 99.9 percent water; the remaining substances include suspended and dissolved organic and inorganic materials as well as qualities that are characteristics of residential and industrial wastewaters (Table 2). microorganisms. These materials determine the physical, chemical and biological

1.3.1.Physical Quality:

The physical quality of municipal wastewater is generally reported in terms of temperature, colour odour, and turbidity. These physical parameters are shown below: 1) Temperature: the temperature of wastewater is slightly higher than that of water supply. Temperature has effect upon microbial activity, solubility of gases and the viscosity. 2) Colour: fresh wastewater is light grey. Stale wastewater is dark grey or black.

3) Odour: fresh wastewater has soapy or oily odour, which is somewhat disagreeable. Stale wastewater has putrid odours due to hydrogen sulphide, and other products of decomposition. 4) Turbidity: turbidity in wastewater is caused by a wide variety of suspended solidsin general, more polluted wastewater has higher turbidity.

The municipal wastewater contains microorganisms that play an important role in fungi, protozoa, and algae. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) 1.4.Wastewater Quality Analysis: 1.4.1.Carbonaceous Substrates Since it is not feasible to track all individual organic compounds in the wastewater, the amount of organics is typically expressed by oxygen that is equivalent to the organic contents in wastewater. Measurement of oxygen demand is used for indirect

biological waste treatment the principal groups of microorganisms include bacteria,

measurement of the organic matters. The method is based on the oxygen requirement for the oxidation or degradation of the organic matters in wastewater. Typically, two test methods (COD and BOD) are used to determine the oxygen demand of the wastewater. 1.4.2.BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)

For BOD measurement, organic compounds are oxidized biologically. During BOD test, aerobic microorganisms degrade organic compounds, while they consume measured in this method is known as five-day BOD (BOD5). Since the oxygen at the same time (typically for 5 days incubation period at 25oC). The BOD microorganisms can partially oxidize organic compounds, measured BOD values are

always less than measured COD values for wastewater samples. For example, typical treated municipal wastewater is 5-30 mg BOD5/L. Although BOD analysis is very

COD/BOD5 for municipal wastewater is ~1.5. Typical effluent discharge standard for time consuming and analytical error is relatively high compared to COD test, BOD be useful for design and modelling biological treatment processes. The steps in the laboratory method to measure BOD5 are: Â· Measure a portion of wastewater sample into a 300 ml BOD bottle Â· Use bacteria (seed) in conditions similar to those of natural waters Â· Fill the bottle with aerated dilution water supplemented with nutrients

test is important to evaluate the biodegradability of the wastewater. BOD values can

Â· Measure the initial dissolved oxygen (DO) Â· Incubate the bottle at 20ÂºC for 5 days in the dark Â· Measure the final DO Â· Calculate BOD5. Figure 3 shows a typical set-up for BOD measurement. Since the test bottle is sealed, the difference in the initial and final DO values represents the oxygen consumed by microbes in the waste. This difference in DO is an indirect measure of the organic substances in the bottle. The calculation of the BOD is based on a simple mass balance:

(Mass of BOD in sample) = (Mass of initial DO in bottle at t = 0) Â­ (Mass of final DO in bottle at t=t) Vsample (BOD) = Vbottle(DOo) Â­ Vbottle(DOt) BOD = (DOo-DOt) Ã Vbottle / Vsample Where, Vsample is the volume of the wastewater sample used (mL), and Vbottle is the volume of the BOD bottle which is typically 300 mL. The BOD of municipal wastewater may range from 50 to 200 mg/L. Several dilutions are prepared to cover dissolved oxygen (DOt) of less than 1 mg/L may be discarded for accurate BOD5 calculation.

this range. The depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO0-DOt) less than 2 mg/L or residual

In BOD5 test, 60 to 70% of the biodegradable organic matter is consumed. Therefore, another term 'ultimate BOD' is used to represent the maximum BOD exerted by the wastewater.

Figure 3: A typical set-up for BOD measurement (www.hach.com) As shown Figure 4, if we wait for a long time in BOD test, the bacteria will continue consuming the organic material and DO, and the total DO will drop at a point that ultimate BOD, and theoretically it takes infinite time. Typical BODu/BOD5 for municipal wastewater is ~1.5. Please note that it is possible to develop such correlations for a specific wastewater stream, but such correlations cannot be represents the 'ultimate BOD' (BODu). It is difficult to assign exact time to achieve

generalized for use with any other wastewater streams. (Ministry of Enviornment Ontario, 2008) (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Indian Institute of Technology, India , 2016)

Figure 4: Ultimate BOD Estimation Using Long Term Incubation Since long incubation and waiting period for BODu result is not desirable, BODu is also

estimated using BOD kinetics model or degradation rate of BOD. In a BOD test, the rate at

which BOD are degraded by the microbes is assumed to be a first order reaction. Therefore, temperature. Figure 5 shows BOD remaining with incubation time. Mathematically, we can express this relationship as follows: =

the rate of BOD utilized is proportional to the amount of available BOD at that time and

Figure 5: BOD Remaining with Incubation Time. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) 1.4.3.COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)

For COD measurement, all organic compounds are completely oxidized to CO2 under acidic Potassium permanganate, KMnO4). Since strong chemical oxidant is used for this analysis, the

environment using a strong oxidizing agent (e.g., Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, and method is known as chemical oxygen demand. COD test can be conducted within a very short period (1-3 hours), and analytical error is relatively low. Therefore, total COD (TCOD) and soluble COD (SCOD) concentrations are typically measured for rapid monitoring of

wastewater characteristics or treatment efficiency. For SCOD measurement, the wastewater and SCOD represents the particulate COD (pCOD) fraction in the wastewater. However, measurement of TCOD and SCOD may not be sufficient for simulation and modeling of fractions may be used for studying advanced wastewater treatment. In comprehensive analysis,

the total COD in the wastewater is made up of the following fractions with different microbiological properties (Figure 6):

TCOD = rbCOD + sbCOD + nbsCOD + nbpCOD Where, rbCOD is the readily biodegradable substrate (mg/L) sbCOD is the slowly biodegradable substrate (mg/L) nbsCOD non-biodegradable (inert) soluble organic matter (mg/L) nbpCOD non-biodegradable (inert) particulate organic matter (mg/L) This comprehensive COD fractionation is used for advanced design and mathematical modelling of wastewater treatment process.

A velocity of at least 0.6-2.4 meter per second (ideally 0.6 m/s) should be clog underground pipes and cause odors. Therefore, manholes are typically located every 90areas and areas a great distance away from the treatment facility. These pumping stations lift the wastewater to a higher elevation where it can flow again by gravity or may be pumped under pressure to the treatment facility.

A system transport sanitary sewer, storm combined sewer systems are very uncommon these days, since they may cause several runoff, and industrial wastewater is known as combined sewer system (Figure 7B). However, operational problems. For instance, hydraulic overloading during heavy rainfall or snowmelt may cause complete system failure. Therefore, separate sewer systems are used in most of the occasionally and discharge excess wastewater directly to nearby water bodies (see Figure 3B). domestic and/or industrial wastes along with storm water. Since CSOs can adversely affect is required for the management of CSOs. developing countries. However, combined sewer systems are designed to overflow These overflows are known as combined sewer overflows (CSOs) which contain untreated aquatic ecosystem and can create aesthetic problems such as odors, high rate treatment process Collection systems represent major capital investments and deteriorate with time and use. The

materials that can be used for underground piping must have resistance to damage by the wastewater to minimize leakage. Materials typically used for underground piping are asbestos cement pipe, cast iron pipe, ductile iron pipe, reinforced or non-reinforced concrete pipe, fiberglass reinforced pipe, and high density polyethylene pipe etc. (Elbeshbishy, 2016)

3.1.Introduction:

3.Treatment Processes Physical, chemical or biological treatment methods are combined for wastewater treatment depending on the nature of the pollutants and desired level of removal. Wastewater treatment systems are typically designed as a train of unit operations (physical treatment) and unit 8). In general, unit processes are ordered in a way that: 1) Pollutants are removed as efficiently as possible 2) Unit processes are protected from pollutants that will damage them Modern wastewater treatment process consists of four (four) levels including preliminary, primary, secondary treatment, tertiary or advanced treatment. Preliminary and primary treatments are mainly physical/mechanical (screening and gravity settling), while secondary and tertiary treatments use combination of biological, physical, and chemical treatment process (Figure 9).

processes (chemical/biological treatment) that remove specific classes of contaminants (Figure

Preliminary treatment removes larger inorganic materials and floating particles from raw wastewater that may cause maintenance or operational problems. Typically used unit operations in primary treatment are screen, grit chamber, and dissolved air flotation. During diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. Primary treatment removes a major portion (50-60%) of

In the aeration tank, aerobic microbes convert the dissolved and colloidal organic matters in wastewater to carbon dioxide, water, and

secondary treatment typically uses basic biological activated sludge (AS) process that consists

energy for their growth and reproduction of new cells. The goal of AS systems is to treat

wastewaters, which means new synthesized cells should be separated from the treated wastewater. The secondary settling tank separates these microbial cells by gravity settling. The solids (new cells) settled out from the secondary clarifier is known as activated sludge. A sludge or RAS), while another portion of the sludges are taken out from the system (known as

portion of the settled biomass is recycled back to the aeration tank (known as recycled activated waste activated sludge or WAS). The WAS is thickened and sent to the AD along with PS. Other unit processes that can be used for secondary treatment are aerated lagoon, anaerobic lagoon, rotating biological contractor (RBC), trickling filter, up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB). These processes are typically used for small scale WWTP. The supernatant liquid phosphorous). Nitrogen can be biologically removed via oxidation of ammonia to nitrate from the secondary settling tank may contain a significant amount of nutrients (nitrogen and (known as nitrification process) followed by nitrate reduction to nitrogen (N2) gas enhanced biological phosphorous removal (EBPR). In EBPR process, specific microbes,

When the cells are enriched with polyphosphate, the biomass is then separated for phosphorous removal. Before discharge to the water bodies, disinfectants are added for

Chemical treatment using ferric chloride or alum can be also used pathogen removal from treated wastewater.

equipment, including choking the pipes and pumps and hampering the growth of the microbes The main two types of screens are coarse and fine screens. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Federation of Canadian Municipalities and National Research Council, 2003) Coarse Screens:

Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have

openings of 6 mm (0.25 in) or larger. The most widely used coarse screen in wastewater

industry is bar screens (Figure 10 A & B). Based on the cleaning operation bar screens are classified as manually cleaned screens or mechanically cleaned screens. The bar spacing for cleaned bar screens is in the range of 2-5 cm. Manually cleaned screens are typically mounted mechanically cleaned screen is in the range of 1.5-4 cm, while the bar spacing for manually at an angle of 45-70 degree from horizontal to increase cleaning surfaces, making cleaning easier, and prevent excessive head loss by clogging. Mechanically cleaned screens are mounted at an angle of 70-90 degree from horizontal. For mechanically cleaned screens, at least two (Elbeshbishy, 2016) units should be installed so that one unit may be taken out of service for maintenance.

Â· For wastewater flow rates >1000 m3/d, mechanically cleaned screens are preferred

Fine Screens:

Figure 10: (A) Schematic of a Typical bar Screen used in wastewater treatment plant (source water.me.vccs.edu) (B) photograph of a bar screen (http://www.infobarscreens.com/bar-screen.jpg)

Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in wastewater treatment plants that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are less than 6 mm. Very fine screens with openings of 0.2 to 1.5 mm placed after coarse screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. However, capital cost and maintenance for fine screens is much higher than coarse screens.

Figure 12: Shows Manual & Mechanized Screen Cleaning (Indian Institute of Technology, India , 2016) 3.2.2.Aerated Grit Chambers: Minute pieces of mineral matter like sand, and gravel, and materials that are not of

mineral origin like coffee grounds, seeds, and similar material constitute grit. Grit in sewage has two characteristics: (1) They are nonputrescible and (2) they have subsiding velocities substantially greater than those of organic putrescible solids. Grit chambers are located downstream of screen chambers. The purpose of a grit chamber is three fold: (1) the protection of moving mechanical equipment from
21

abrasion and accompanying abnormal wear, (2) the reduction of pipe clogging caused

by deposition of grit particles or heavy sludge in pipes and channels, particularly at changes in direction of conduits, and (3) reduction of frequency of digester and settling tank cleaning required as a result of excessive accumulation of grit in these units. Fig 13 shows section of aerated grit chamber. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) Horizontal Flow Grit Chamber: direction. A constant velocity of flow through the grit chamber must be maintained at accompanied by means of providing a sutro weir. (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) (Elbeshbishy, 2016) In the horizontal flow type, the flow passes through the chamber in a horizontal

0.9 m/sec for all depths of flow in order to prevent settling of organic solids. This is

Aerated Grit Chamber:

Figure 14: Sutro Weir (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008)

The aerated type consists of a spiralflow aeration tank, the spiral velocity being controlled by the dimensions and the quantity of air supplied to the unit. The detention provided is 3 minutes at the maximum flow rate. The grit solids are raked by a rotating mechanism to a sump at the side of the tank, from

which they are moved by a reciprocating rake mechanism. The quantities of grit vary from one location to another depending on the type of sewerage system, the characteristics of the drainage area, the condition of the sewers, the frequency of street sanding, the type of industrial wastes, the number of garbage grinders served, and the proximity and use of sandy bathing beaches. There is a wide range in the quantity of

grit varying from 1/3 ft3 to 24 ft3 per million gallon of sewage treated. Because of the wide variation, a factor of safety must be used in calculations concerning the actual storage, handling, or disposal of the grit. Common method of grit disposal is as fill, covered if necessary to prevent objectionable conditions. Grit also is incinerated with sludge. In coastal cities grit and screenings are barged to sea and dumped. Generally, the grit must be washed before removal. 3.3.Flow Equalization

The wastewater to be treated in the WWTP has a lot of variations in flow rates. Since a WWTP is typically designed for a certain flow rate, treatment performance can't sustain equalization is a method to overcome such problems related to fluctuations in flow rates
23

during large daily or seasonal variations in flow rates. In-line and side-line flow (Figure 15). Flow equalisation basins store excess water for later treatment. Flow

equalisation basin is located after most of the preliminary treatment units such as screening and grit removal but before primary sedimentation.

The principal design parameter of flow equalization basin is size, and typically designed

as completely mixed basins. Flow equalisation basins are typically designed by examining cumulative inflow over one day. Figure 16 shows two typical inflow patterns. The straight line drawn from origin to the end point of the diagram shows the average daily flow rate. (Elbeshbishy, 2016)

For Flow Pattern A, a line parallel to the average daily flow rate is drawn at the low of tangency to the straight line representing the average flow rate represents the required

3.4.Primary Treatment

Primary treatment consists of settling the sewage in a sedimentation tank. Whenever a liquid containing solids in suspension is placed in a relatively quiescent state, those solids having a higher specific gravity than the liquid will tend to settle, and those with lower specific gravity will tend to rise. These principles are utilized in reduce the suspended solids content by removing readily settleable solids and National Research Council, 2003) the design of sedimentation tanks. The objective of treatment by sedimentation is to floating material. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Federation of Canadian Municipalities and Efficiently designed and operated primary sedimentation tanks should remove from on the basis of a surfaceloading rate at the average rate of flow, expressed as time on SS removal varies widely depending on the character of the sewage,

Higher designed to provide 90 to 150 min of detention based on the average rate of sewage designed for average flows of 1 MGD or less. For plants designed for higher flows, the weir loading rate can be increased up to a maximum of 15,000 gallons/linear over flow rates. A minimum water depth of 7 ft is recommended. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Ministry of Enviornment -Ontario, 2008) Tank type, size and shape Â­ Almost all sedimentation tanks are designed as ft/day. Weir rates have been found to have less effect on efficiencies of removal than

rectangular or circular tanks with mechanical cleaning mechanism. The selection of the shape is governed by the size of the installation, by rules and regulations of permitting authorities, by local site conditions and the estimate of cost. Two or more

influencing the selection other than the size of the plant. The side wall depth varies from 7 to 14 ft. Floors are deepest at the center and slope radially upwards to the tank walls at a rate of 1 in per ft. The slope facilitates sludge withdrawal and drainage of the tank.

In one type of circular tanks, the sewage is carried to the center of the tank in a pipe suspended from a bridge or encased in concrete beneath the tank floor. At the center of the tank, sewage enters a circular well designed to distribute the flow equally in all directions. The removal mechanism moves continuously at a peripheral speed of 5 to 8 ft/min and may have two or four arms equipped with scrapers. The arms also support blades for scum removal. In the second

type, a suspended circular aluminium baffle at a short distance from the tank wall forms an

annular space into which the sewage is distributed in a tangential direction. The sewage flows spirally around the tank and underneath the baffle, the clarified liquid being skimmed off over weirs on both sides of a centrally located weir trough. Grease and scum are confined to the in 12 hours depending upon the volume to be pumped and the plant operating schedules.

3.5.Biological Treatment (Secondary Treatment)

The idea of secondary treatment is to get rid of the soluble organics that is not possible to be treated in primary treatment process. These dissolved and suspended organic materials are decayed by the microorganisms usually Hetrotrophs in aerobic environment to more stable organic matter and subsequently are removed as sludge from the wastewater.

The secondary treatment can eliminate more than 85 percent of the BOD (5 d) and suspended solids, it does not eliminate the significant amount of nitrogen, phosphor Institute of Technology, India , 2016) 3.5.1.Activated Sludge Process heavy metals, no degradable organics, bacteria and viruses. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Indian

The most common suspended growth process used for municipal wastewater treatment is the activated sludge process as shown in figure 20:

Figure 20: Activated Sludge Process (Indian Institute of Technology, India , 2016)

30

Activated sludge plant involves: 1. wastewater aeration in the presence of a microbial suspension, 2. solid-liquid separation following aeration, 3. discharge of clarified effluent, 4. wasting of excess biomass, and

5. return of remaining biomass to the aeration tank. During the activated sludge process wastewater containing organic matter is aerated in an aeration basin in which microorganisms metabolize the suspended and soluble organic matter. Some percentage of organic matter is synthesized into new cells and some part is oxidized to CO2 and water to derive energy. In activated sludge systems the new cells formed in the

reaction are eliminated from the liquid stream in the form of a flocculent sludge in secondary clarifier settling tanks. A percentage of this settled biomass, described as activated sludge is returned to the aeration tank and the remaining percentage forms waste or excess sludge. (Indian Institute of Technology, India , 2016) Activated Sludge Process Variables The main variables of activated sludge process are the mixing regime, loading rate, and the flow scheme. Mixing Regime Generally, two types of mixing system are of major interest in activated sludge process: plug flow of mixed liquor through the aeration tank with no element of mixed liquor overtaking or mixing with any other element. There may be sideways mixing of mixed liquor but there must be no mixing along the path of flow. In complete mixing, the substances of aeration tank are well stirred and uniform throughout. aeration tank contents. flow and complete mixing (Fig 21). In the plug flow, the system is characterized by orderly

Thus, at steady state, the effluent from the aeration tank has the same composition as the

31

The type of mixing system is very important as it affects (1) oxygen transfer requirements in the aeration tank, (2) susceptibility of biomass to shock loads, (3) local environmental conditions in the aeration tank, and (4) the kinetics governing the treatment process. Loading Rate A loading parameter that has been developed over the years is the hydraulic retention time (HRT), q, d

q = V/Q V= volume of aeration tank, m3, and Q= sewage inflow, m3/d

Figure 21: Completely Mixed Activated Sludge Process

Another empirical loading parameter is volumetric organic loading which is defined as the BOD applied per unit volume of aeration tank, per day.
32

A rational loading parameter, which has found wider acceptance and is preferred is specific substrate utilization rate, q, per day. q= Q (SO - Se) V X A similar loading parameter is mean cell residence time or sludge retention time (SRT), qc, d qc = VX QwXr + (Q-QwXe) where SO and Se are influent and effluent organic matter concentration respectively, measured as BOD5 (g/m3), X, Xe and Xr are MLSS concentration in aeration tank, effluent and return sludge respectively, and Qw= waste activated sludge rate. Under steady state operation the mass of waste activated sludge is given by QwXr = YQ (SO - Se) - kd XV where Y= maximum yield coefficient (microbial mass synthesized / mass of substrate utilized) and kd = endogenous decay rate (d-1) . From the above equation it is seen that 1/qc = Yq - kd If the value of Se is small as compared SO, q may also be expressed as Food to Microorganism ratio, F/M F/M = Q(SO- Se) / XV = QSO / XV The qc value adopted for design controls the effluent quality, and settleability and drainability of biomass, oxygen requirement and quantity of waste activated sludge. Flow Scheme The flow scheme involves:

Sewage addition may be at a single point at the inlet end or it may be at several points along or through a sludge reaeration tank. Aeration may be at a uniform rate or it may be varied from the head of the aeration tank to its end. 3.5.2.Trickling Filters

Trickling filter is an attached growth process i.e. process in which microorganisms responsible for treatment are attached to an inert packing material. Packing material used in attached growth processes include, sand, redwood, rock, gravel, slag and a wide range of plastic and Daigger, 1987)

other artificially prepared materials.(Logan, Hermanowicz, & Denny, 1987) (Harrison &

Figure 22: High Rate Trickling Filter

34

Process Description The wastewater in trickling filter is distributed over the top area of a vessel containing nonsubmerged packing material.
 

Air circulation in the void space, by either natural draft or blowers, provides oxygen for the microorganisms growing as an attached biofilm. During operation, the organic material present in the wastewater is metabolised by the

biomass attached to the medium. The biological slime grows in thickness as the organic

 

matter abstracted from the flowing wastewater is synthesized into new cellular material. The depth of penetration of oxygen into the microbial layer limits the thickness of the aerobic layer.

The micro-organisms near the medium face enter the endogenous phase as the substrate is metabolised before it can reach the micro-organisms near the medium face as a result of increased thickness of the slime layer and lose their ability to cling to the media surface. The liquid then washes the slime off the medium and a new slime layer starts to grow. This phenomenon of losing the slime layer is called sloughing.

The sloughed off film and treated wastewater are collected by an underdrainage which also allows circulation of air through filter. The collected liquid is passed to a settling tank used for solid- liquid separation. Types of Filters (Refer table 3) Trickling filters are classified as high rate or low rate, based on the organic and hydraulic loading applied to the unit.

Pond systems, in which oxygen is provided through mechanical aeration rather than algal photosynthesis are called aerated lagoons. Lightly loaded ponds used as tertiary step in waste treatment for polishing of secondary effluents and removal of bacteria are called maturation ponds.

Classification of Stabilization Ponds Stabilization ponds may be aerobic, anaerobic or facultative.


Aerobic ponds are shallow ponds with depth less than 0.5 m and BOD loading of 40ponds develop intense algal growth.

400-3000 kg/ha.d Such ponds are constructed with a depth of 2.5-5m as light Facultative pond functions aerobically at the surface while anaerobic conditions prevail at the bottom. They are often about 1 to 2 m in depth. The aerobic layer acts as a good check against odour evolution from the pond.



38

Mechanism of Purification The functioning of a facultative stabilization pond and symbiotic relationship in the pond are shown below. Sewage organics are stabilized by both aerobic and anaerobic reactions. In the top aerobic layer, where oxygen is supplied through algal

photosynthesis, the non-settleable and dissolved organic matter is oxidized to CO2 and water. In addition, some of the end products of partial anaerobic decomposition such as volatile acids and alcohols, which may permeate to upper layers are also oxidized periodically. The settled sludge mass originating from raw waste and microbial undergo stabilization through conversion to methane which escapes the pond in form of bubbles. Refer to fig 24. synthesis in the aerobic layer and dissolved and suspended organics in the lower layers

39

The depth of aerobic layer in a facultative pond is a function of solar radiation, waste production by algae falls short of the oxygen requirement and the depth of aerobic layer decreases. Further, there is a decrease in the photosynthetic activity of algae because of greater turbidity and inhibitory effect of higher concentration of organic matter.

characteristics, loading and temperature. As the organic loading is increased, oxygen

Gasification of organic matter to methane is carried out in distinct steps of acid production by acid forming bacteria and acid utilization by methane bacteria. If the second step does not proceed satisfactorily, there is an accumulation of organic acids resulting in decrease of pH which would result in complete inhibition of methane bacteria. Two possible reasons for imbalance between activities of methane bacteria are: (1) the waste may contain inhibitory substances which would retard the activity of methane bacteria and not affect the activity of rapidly with fall in temperature as compared to the acid formers. of facultative ponds. acid producers to the same extent. (2) The activity of methane bacteria decreases much more Thus, year round warm temperature and sunshine provide an ideal environment for operation Algal Growth and Oxygen Production Algal growth converts solar energy to chemical energy in the organic form. Empirical studies have shown that generally about 6% of visible light energy can be converted to algal energy. The chemical energy contained in an algal cell averages 6000 calories per gram of algae.
Depending on the sky clearance factor for an area, the average visible radiation received can be

estimated as follows:

Avg. radiation = Min. radiation + [(Max. radiation - Min. radiation) x sky clearance factor] Oxygen production occurs concurrently with algal production in accordance with following equation:

106C02 + 16NO3 + HPO4 + 122H2O + 18H+

C106H263O110N16P1 + 138O2

On weight basis, the oxygen production is 1.3 times the algal production.

Areal Organic Loading The permissible areal organic loading for the pond expressed as kg BOD/ha.day will depend on the minimum incidence of sunlight that can be expected at a location and also on the percentage of influent BOD that would have to be satisfied aerobically. The Bureau of Indian stabilize the organic matter and keep the pond odour free. The values are applicable to towns Standards has related the permissible loading to the latitude of the pond location to aerobically at sea levels and where sky is clear for nearly 75% of the days in a year. The values may be

modified for elevations above sea level by dividing by a factor (1 + 0.003 EL) where EL is the of Technology, India , 2016) Detention Time The flow of sewage can approximate either plug flow or complete mixing or dispersed flow. If BOD exertion is described by first order reaction, the pond efficiency is given by: for plug flow: Le/Li = e-k1t for complete mixing: Le/Li = 1 1+k1t

elevation of the pond site above MSL in hundred meters. (Elbeshbishy, 2016) (Indian Institute

For dispersed flow the efficiency of treatment for different degrees of intermixing is

characterized by dispersion numbers. Choice of a larger value for dispersion number or Depth

Having determined the surface area and detention capacity, it becomes necessary to consider the depth of the pond only in regard to its limiting value. The optimum range of depth for facultative ponds is 1.0 - 1.5 m.

Conversion rates during anaerobic treatment of soluble substrates are generally described by Monod kinetics (Pavlostathis and Giraldo-GÃ³mez, 1991; van Haandel and compared to single stage digestion.

Recently, prospects of multi-phase digestion have become more promising methanogenic microorganisms are kept in a single reactor. Both groups of microorganisms are

different in terms of physiology, pH requirement, nutrient requirement, growth kinetics, ability to tolerate environmental conditions (Demirel and YenigÃ¼n, 2002; Demirer and Chen, 2005). Favorable operating conditions such as shorter HRT and lower pH for acid-forming bacteria

are not suitable for methane-forming bacteria (Demirer and Chen, 2005). Therefore, it is very difficult to provide an optimum condition for different groups of microorganisms in a conventional single stage digester. Several studies have shown that two-phase digestion is more Alvarez et al., 2000).

The advantages offered by anaerobic digestion include (Ward, Hobbs, Holliman, & Jones, 2008), (Metcalf & Eddy, 2002) (Tsonis & Grigoropoulos, 1993) 1. Excess energy over that required by the process is produced. Methane is produced and produce electricity, or as engine fuel;

2. The quantity of total solids for ultimate disposal is reduced. The volatile solids present are converted to methane, carbon dioxide, and water thereby reducing the quantity of solids. About 30 to 40% of the total solids may be destroyed and 40 to 60% of the volatile solids may be destroyed;

Disadvantages

The disadvantages associated with anaerobic digestion include: slow to recover;

1. The digester is easily upset by unusual conditions and erratic or high loadings and very 2. Operators must follow proper operating procedures;

3. Heating and mixing equipment are required for satisfactory performance

The resultant supernatant side stream is a strong waste stream that greatly adds to the loading of the wastewater plant. It contains high concentrations of BOD, COD, suspended solids and ammonia nitrogen; retention times (SRT's) of 15 to 20 days for a high-rate system. Thus capital cost is high.

Digestion Tanks and Number of Stages

With anaerobic sludge digestion facilities, the need for multiple units can often be avoided by providing two-stage digestion along with sufficient flexibility in sludge pumpage and mixing so that one stage can be serviced while the other stage receives the raw sludge pumpage. Single stage digesters will generally not be satisfactory due to the usual need for sludge storage, and

effective supernating. They will be considered, however, where the designer can show that the storage can be used in the event of breakdown.

Choosing a proper depth-diameter ratio can minimize heat loss from digesters, such that the total surface area is the least for a given volume.

structural requirements and scum control aspects also govern the optimum depth-diameter Floor Slope To facilitate draining, cleaning and maintenance, the following features are desirable: 1. The tank bottom should slope to drain toward the withdrawal pipe; 2. For tanks equipped with mechanisms for withdrawal of sludge, a bottom slope not less than 1:12 (vertical: horizontal) is recommended; and 3. Where the sludge is to be removed by gravity alone, 1:4 slope is recommended. Depth and Freeboard sufficient to allow for the formation of a reasonable depth of supernatant liquor. A minimum water depth of 6 m is recommended. The acceptable range for sidewater depth is between 6 and 14 m. For those units proposed to serve as supernatant development tanks, the depth should be

The freeboard provided must take into consideration the type of cover and maximum gas pressure. For floating covers, the normal working water level in the tank under gas pressure is between the liquid level and the top of the tank wall. For fixed flat slab roofs, a freeboard of approximately 0.8 m below the top of the wall, thus providing from 0.5 to 0.6 m of freeboard 0.3 to 0.6 m above the working liquid level is commonly provided. For fixed conical or domed roofs, the freeboard between the working liquid level and the top of the wall inside the tank can be reduced to less than 0.3 m.

Scum Control Including any of the following provisions in the equipment design can control scum accumulation: up; 1. Floating covers keep the scum layer submerged and thus moist and more likely to be broken 2. Discharging re-circulated sludge on the scum mat serves the same purpose as (1); 3. Re-circulating sludge gas under pressure through the tank liquors and scum; 4. Mechanically destroying the scum by employing rotating arms or a propeller in a draft tube; 5. A large depth-area ratio; or 6. A concentrated sludge feed to the digester. Items (5) and (6) would release large volumes of gas per unit area, keep the scum in motion and mix the solids in the digester. Grit and Sand Control The digesters should be designed to minimize sedimentation of the particles and facilitate removal if settling takes place. These objectives can be achieved if tank contents are kept moving at 0.23 to 0.3 m/s and the floor slopes are about 1:4. Alkalinity and PH Control The effective pH range for methane producers is approximately 6.5 to 7.5 with an optimum production and to eliminate digester upsets. range of 6.8 to 7.2. Maintenance of this optimum range is important to ensure good gas The stability of the digestion process depends on the buffering capacity of the digester contents;

the ability of the digester contents to resist pH changes. The alkalinity is a measure of the buffer capacity of a freshwater system. Higher alkalinity values indicate a greater capacity for resisting pH changes. The alkalinity shall be measured as bicarbonate alkalinity. Values for alkalinity in anaerobic digesters range from 1500 to 5000 mg/L as CaCO3. The volatile acids produced by the acid producers tend to depress pH. Volatile acid concentrations under stable conditions range from 100 to 500 mg/L. Therefore, a constant ratio below 0.25 of volatile acids

It is summary of nitrogen and phosphorus recovery and the potential agriculture utilization in

the economic conditions of decreasing world phosphorus resources. Phosphorus recovery methods discussed in the chapter are grouped according to the type of mainstream P removal process (i.e. EBPR or chemical) and point of recovery (i.e. biosolids, SDL, mainstream, ash).

Nitrogen and phosphorus are essential to life and cannot be substituted. Nitrogen is assimilated by plants and can be easily synthesized by the conventional Haber-Bosch process (Cornel and Schaum 2009). Phosphorus on the other hand is obtained from phosphate rock from reserves,

which will be depleted within this century as the population increases to 10 billion people. Some 80% of mined phosphorus is used in agriculture where the application of P-fertilizer phosphorus. increases with the affluence of developing nations resulting in accelerated consumption of Canada's population approaching 36 million discharges some 43,000 tons of phosphorus in municipal wastewater per year. Recovery of this phosphorus as P2O5 fertilizer would lead to could offset the costs of nutrient removal (Algeo and O'Callaghan, 2012). A number of European countries such as Germany and Sweden have announced national objectives for reduction of some 1 million tons of greenhouse gases (CEEP, 2008) and a revenue stream that

phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater. Phosphorus recovery is now included in UK Environment Agency's strategy. (Damian Kruk, 2015) (Federation of Canadian Municipalities and National Research Council, 2003).

Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in raw municipal wastewater depend on unit water consumption and range from 4 to 20 mg TP/L and from 30 to 100 mg TN/L. The concentrations in side streams depend on the method of solids treatment and vary from 30 to 250 mg TP/L and reuse. Nutrient removal can be in the form of concentration in the biomass such as in

and 200 to 2000 mg TN/L. Figure 25 presents the main steps required for nutrients recovery

Figure 25: The Three Main Steps in Nutrient Recovery and Reuse (Federation of Canadian Municipalities and National Research Council, 2003) In spite of importance of nutrient recovery, only a handful of WWTPs in North America have implemented extractive phosphorus recovery. According to the conducted survey, among 69 extractive recovery in the future. The participants mentioned lack of economic drivers and responding WWTPs only 4.6% are currently recovering nutrients and only 26.2% are planning regulations as the main reasons against implementing recovery units.

concentration of 0.1 to 1 mg/L, additional 50% of the incoming phosphorus load has to be their combination. This means approximately 95% of the incoming phosphorus load is

incorporated into the wastewater sludge (Cornel and Schaum 2009). A rough phosphorus balance for a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant is shown in Figure 26. The numbers 90-95% efficient (Federation of Canadian Municipalities and National Research Council, 2003) illustrate maximum potential for phosphorus recovery. The recovery technologies are typically

In North America the influent nitrogen concentration in municipal wastewater are in the range of 25 to 50 mg/L, with an average concentration of 40 mg/L. In a biological nutrient removal wastewater treatment approximately 65% of the incoming nitrogen is removed through nitrification and denitrification process.

Figure 27: Potentially Recoverable Nitrogen at Various Points in a Typical WWT (Federation of Canadian Municipalities and National Research Council, 2003) As illustrated in both P and N mass balance graphs, nutrient loading from sludge handling processes in the sidestream can be very significant for the mainstream removal processes. Plants have reported return nitrogen loads as high as 35% of the incoming load. High

concentrations of phosphorus in the sidestream also results in increased operational and maintenance costs due to maintenance problems from phosphorus precipitation. Therefore, a dedicated recovery system in the sidestream, can benefit mainstream treatment and allow nutrient recovery.

3.6.2.Phosphorous Recovery from Sludge Originating from a Biological Process Phosphorus recovery from biosolids Biological phosphorus removal is achieved by enrichment of PAOs in the activated sludge. The selection of PAOs acts to increase the net phosphorus concentration within biological solids. Phosphorus is then removed from wastewater by wasting biological solids, including PAOs, from the mainstream as WAS. The phosphorus-enriched WAS is, potentially, a form of recovered phosphorus that can be applied to land as fertilizer. WAS from non-BNR systems

can also be land applied as fertilizer, replenishing both nitrogen and phosphorus. The

meaningful recovery and reuse of nutrients can thus be achieved without extractive recovery systems and should be considered in design when the municipality cannot feasibly meet the capital cost of extractive recovery technologies. Biosolids for land application need to be stabilized and disinfected. A number of treatment technologies are available e.g. Lystek, NViro, VitAG, Neutrallizer and Schwing-Bioset process etc. The Lystek process uses high pH

4.Optimization Opportunities Through Process Modifications 4.1.Plant Hydraulics Rapid changes in hydraulic load are caused by such things as intermittent pumped variations in flow and load can affect the performance of the whole plant. These issues can be addressed by operational modifications such as:         using multiple smaller constant speed pumps; using a recycle system for variable flow control;

Inflow and infiltration (I/I) can be major sources of flow in wastewater systems. This

impacts on system performance due to increased flow through the system and higher

demand requirements from pumping stations. By implementing I/I reduction programs, wastewater flows requiring treatment can be significantly reduced resulting in lower treatment requirements and consequent resource (chemical and energy) savings. Screening

Inadequate screening can limit plant performance and capacity, and greatly increase

O&M requirements. Although many small WWTPs still use manually cleaned screens,

all plants should consider upgrading to automatically cleaned screens. Screen cleaning screens for maintenance can also increase process flexibility. Grit Removal

at high velocities for better mixing. As a result of the better mixing achieved with Reduce Pre-Precipitation Chemicals for Phosphorus Removal Chemicals can be added for phosphorus removal at either the primary or secondary level of treatment. Generally, chemicals are more efficient for phosphorus removal when added to secondary treatment, and chemical use savings can be achieved. Chemicals may still be used in primary treatment to enhance biological nutrient removal (BOD5) removal in some facilities, reducing energy use in the biological system and secondary sludge production. Multi-point chemical addition results in the

Process equipment can be installed to increase process flexibility.

to distribute flow for uniform entry into the clarifier. For circular clarifiers, a

ring baffle supported off the sludge collection mechanisms has also proven useful in dissipating inlet energy and disrupting the density current.

A common misconception associated with the performance of clarifiers in a suspended

growth system is that solids loss is the result of a clarifier failure, when, in fact, it is often due to poor sludge settling characteristics. The presence of excessive quantities of filamentous micro-organisms can cause a poorly settled biomass. By improving the settling characteristics of the sludge, the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration that can be maintained in the system is increased, which allows an

increase in the organic loading on the system, resulting in the opportunity to increase plant capacity without increasing the basin volume. For a nitrifying system, an increased MLSS concentration allows nitrification to be accomplished at shorter HRTs. Several sludge bulking control measures are available including:

Inadequate Return Sludge and Waste Sludge Flexibility

According to Assessment of Factors Affecting the Performance of Ontario Sewage Treatment Facilities (XCG, 1992), the lack of instrumentation to measure return sludge and waste sludge flow rates was the most serious limitation at small WWTPs with air lift sludge return systems. Without the knowledge of these flow rates, it is difficult to adjust for changes in flow or settling characteristics, or to control solids inventory in the plant.

Selection of residence time of wastewater in the bioreactor (i.e., activated sludge time is selected primarily based on the characteristics of wastewater, mass loading rate and microbial biodegradation kinetics. Typically, two residence times used for biological treatment processes:

Figure 33: CSTR (Elbeshbishy, 2016) SRT is the average time that the particulate matter (e.g., cell biomass) stays in the bioreactor (also known as sludge age or mean cell residence time). The SRT can be expressed using the following equation: SRT, c =

Now, we will calculate SRT for bioreactors with and without effluent recycle. concentrations in the reactor and effluent are same (X mg/L). The SRT of the system can be calculated from the following equation. SRT, c =

In AS process, solids are discharged from two points: (1) wastewater effluent and (2) wasting settled sludge from the bottom of the clarifier, as described in of biomass (solids) discharge rate for effluent and clarifier (QwXw + QeXe). Thus, SRT for AS process can be expressed as following, Figure 29. Therefore, the total biomass discharge rate would be the summation

The required SRT and HRT depend on the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated. For biodegradable wastewater (containing high BOD), bioreactor can be operated at shorter HRT. However, at very short SRT, microbes can wash out from the bioreactor, while increasing SRT

Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) Typical MLSS in aeration tank range from 2000 to 4000 mg/L. Actual MLSS include inorganic inert solids, active biomass, cell debris (decay products) and nbVSS (from influent suspended solids (MLVSS) mainly represent the heterotrophic cell biomass. Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), TSS WW) that are considered in advanced models. We will consider that the mixed liquor volatile

A estimating functions that provide logical and repeatable relationships between

The independent variables are known as cost drivers, and project to be estimated. estimates. typically may be physical, performance, or operational characteristics associated with the Capacity factor and equipment factors estimates are simple examples of parametric Parametric estimating provides several advantages as an estimating technique. Parametric estimates are: Â· Efficient: They not only allowing estimates to be prepared in much less time than definition to support the estimate.

All costs are traceable. Â· Consistent: If two estimators input the same values for parameters, they will get the same resulting cost. Parametric models also provide a consistent estimate format and estimate documentation.

Â· Flexible: Parametric models provide costs for a range of input values, extrapolating to models can be easily adjusted to provide cost sensitivity analysis for proposed design changes.

Parametric estimating is the process of estimating cost by using mathematical equations being estimated (Wyskida-Steward ).

We assume that the capital cost of the WWTP is proportional to the combined volume of the various units in the WWTP.

It is based on the premises that the more the combined volume of the WWTP units with same functional and performance characteristics. The percent cost savings can be established by the following computations.

9.Conclusion It has been demonstrated by the design example that the capital cost of the Municipal

wastewater treatment can be reduced by almost 22 percent, when we do not use the primary sedimentation tank. The capital cost savings are achieved by reduction in the volume of the CSTR is also reduced due to the less volume of sludge produced from aeration tank. The long established and is being used widely in the cost calculations of the capital projects. It can be seen that the there are many ways the operating performance of the municipal the required parameters. The nutrients can be removed in many ways and this helps to methods of nutrients recovery are discussed. sedimentation tank and there is minor increase in the size of the aeration tank. The size of the model for cost estimation is based on the concept of parametric estimation, which has been

wastewater treatment plant can be achieved by carefully studying the problem and measuring maintain the clean environment as well as saving costs to produce those nutrients. Various
