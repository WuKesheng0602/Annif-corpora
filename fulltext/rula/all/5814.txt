 Abstract
  Price discovery is a key function of the futures markets yet limited public information exists about the  pricebuilding models used by market participants. To fill a gap in the literature, interviews were  conducted with the largest coffee and cocoa traders, investors, and organizations to provide insight into  the models they use to forecast supply and futures prices, with an emphasis on the environmental  factors considered to have a significant impact on yield. Despite concerns in the academic literature  about soil degradation and climate change affecting the future viability of these crops, market  participants primarily based their forecasts on shortterm weather patterns that deviated from the  norm, as per historical data. Participants' nearunanimous acknowledgement that low coffee and cocoa  prices pose a threat to the sustainability of the industry suggests that there is room to price in longterm  factors into shortterm futures models.

Concerns expressed by the scientific community do not always prompt action by coffee stakeholders and policy makers, as there is often a greater perceived need to address short term production and profitability challenges. However, the resource-constrained public and private sectors do not seem to invest seriously in climate change adaptation, as long as `hard evidence' in immediate export losses (USD) and livelihood impacts are lacking.   Craparo et al., 2015 

1. Introduction
The main objective of this thesis is to understand the potential to better incorporate environmental  factors into the forecasting models that are currently used by key players in the coffee and cocoa  markets.  The expectation is that by doing so, longterm environmental cost constraints associated with  coffee and cocoa production will be factored into supply and futures forecasting models, and in this  way, more attention will be paid to the importance of addressing the underlying environmental factors  associated with these two commodities beyond those that simply affect the next harvest season. It is  worth mentioning that there are also social factors that affect coffee and cocoa production (e.g.  adequacy of wages, child labour); however, given that the focus of this Master's program is the  environmental sciences and researching the contribution of these social factors would enlarge the scope  of research substantially, the social factors are not a focus of this work. The author's motivation for  pursuing this subject was her previous experience working with coffee farmers in Peru and cocoa  farmers in Côte d'Ivoire and seeing vast discrepancies between the economic, social, and environmental  conditions which farmers face on the ground and the prices which they are paid.   At the outset, it should be noted that there is limited publicly available information concerning  how commodity traders make their decisions, with the specific approaches used being considered  carefully guarded commercial secrets.  When the research for this thesis began, in the absence of  information available to the researcher concerning commodity pricebuilding models that suggested  otherwise, the operating assumption for the research was that current commodity pricing models  employed by market actors only took environmental factors into effect to a limited extent (e.g. taking 

1   

into consideration only major and selfevident environmental shocks like a seasonal drought and not  incorporating gradual, longterm environmental changes, such as those associated with climate change,  into their models). To develop a better understanding of the environmental factors that are currently  being considered in coffee and cocoa forecasting models, interviews with important actors in the coffee  and cocoa industries were conducted. The interviews revealed that the market actors collect substantial  environmental data on an ongoing basis, both on the ground and through thirdparty sources, which  allow them to estimate yield for the upcoming harvest season. To evaluate environmental factors that  significantly affect coffee and cocoa production in the short (<2 years), medium (25 years), and long term (>5 years), a review of important works in the scientific and economic literature was employed.  Concerns about the impending shortage of cocoa and coffee have been widely reported in the  news (e.g. Sayid, 2013 and Collins, 2012) since 2011 and 2012, when the International Center for  Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and the [UK] Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew published articles that predicted  climate change would lead to significant declines in land suitability in areas where coffee and cocoa are  currently grown. Despite evidence that longterm, gradual changes are taking place that may  significantly affect the production of these two crops, little evidence exists to suggest that these changes  are being accounted for in pricing coffee and cocoa.   Coffee and cocoa prices are largely determined by futures markets (see Section 2.2), which bring  together hedgers and speculators (defined below) who respectively offload and take on risk, in a  regulated market where price discovery occurs in a public and transparent setting. Players in these  markets have developed models to forecast supply and demand of these commodities, which in turn are  used to estimate futures prices for given delivery dates. Because the nature of these models is  proprietary, it is unclear to the public what factors are considered in determining futures prices. The  United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), in its Responsible Investor's Guide to  Commodities (2011), expressed surprise "by the relative lack of academic research going beyond simple  2   

regression analysis to actually model and understand the complex mechanisms behind price building in  futures and spot markets. This is particularly true for certain types of commodities and for behavioural  phenomena and herding effects. There certainly is a need for more and better research in this area"  (UNPRI, 2011, pg. 14).  Several news articles located by the author that discuss the subject of commodity pricing seem  to imply that only environmental "shocks" such as droughts, frost, pests, and disease are considered. For  example, Bloomberg reported on October 26, 2014 (Javier, 2014) that increased rainfall in Brazil was  driving Arabica coffee futures prices down after months of drought resulting in crop damage had driven  up prices by 72% since January 2014. No mention is made of any longerterm environmental factors  being taken into account.  In a similar vein, on February 18, 2014, The Wall Street Journal published an  article entitled "ICE Cocoa Futures Edge Up as Dry Weather Fans Supply Worries" (Wexler, 2014) which  detailed the effect of drought in Côte d'Ivoire on futures prices, which rose in anticipation of lower  supply. As these articles suggest, extreme weather events in Brazil and Côte d'Ivoire ­ the largest  producers of these commodities ­ have a significant impact on futures prices and therefore it is not  surprising that these visible and easily quantifiable weather effects are given prominence in light of the  shortterm nature of futures trading. However, is it also reasonable to expect that gradual  environmental changes that take place over the longterm (e.g. climate change) would also have an  influence on yields, such as an increase frequency of extreme weather events or  deteriorating soil  conditions (as discussed in greater detail in Section 5.2)? While the interviews conducted for this study  revealed that market actors are considering certain environmental data beyond shocks in their models,  they have not fully adjusted their models to account for climate change.  As climate change is increasingly accepted as a business risk (Mercer and LGT Capital Partners,  2015), there is a movement in the broader investment community to incorporate environmental, social,  and governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions. The world's leading initiative for responsible 

3   

investment, the aforementioned UNPRI, has grown from 100 signatories, primarily institutional investors  and asset managers, with USD 6.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in 2006 to 1380  signatories with USD 59 trillion AUM in 2015 (UNPRI, 2015a). Signatories of the UNPRI agree to  incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns into their investment analyses and  decisions. While the initiative was started as a way to promote institutional investors to take on a more  active and longterm investment approach in their equity holdings, the incorporation of ESG factors into  other asset classes is now also seen as a logical next step, not just for institutional investors but also for  the other investment service providers with which they work (UNPRI, 2015b). In 2011, the UNPRI issued  a document for commodity investors on how to adopt responsible investment practices, signaling the  market's appetite for guidance on best practice in this area (UNPRI, 2011). A study conducted by Mercer  and LGT Capital Partners (2015) found that 76% of institutional investors integrate ESG factors in their  decisions to invest in alternative asset classes. While the study excluded commodities, what is notable is  that 54% of survey respondents only started to incorporate ESG factors in their alternative asset  investment decisions in the past 3 years (Mercer and LGT Capital Partners, 2015). Given that  commodities are part of the alternative asset class, we may see a push for this kind of analysis being  done for commodity trading in the near future.   One major deterrent to progress in the commodity trading space to date has been the financial  community's focus on shortterm gains. The UNPRI was successful in rallying large asset owners around  the cause of responsible investment given that they are longterm investors by nature and therefore  should logically be considering longterm ESG risks such as climate change if they are to perform their  fiduciary duty. This push for longtermism in the investment community has been renewed over the past  few years as a result of a survey conducted by McKinsey and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  (CPPIB) in 2013 (Barton and Wiseman, 2014) that found pressure for companies to perform in the short term had actually increased over time, despite 73% of the stock being held by supposedlylong term  4   

asset owners. However, in contrast to the evolving ESG practices of institutional investors, commodity  trading by nature is shortterm, as futures contracts can only be purchased for fixed delivery dates up to  2 years in advance and often are traded many times prior to the contract closing (UNCTAD, 2012).  Nonetheless, given that perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa are inherently affected by longerterm  environmental and social factors that extend beyond the length of the futures contracts, this shortterm  mentality could hinder the growth of the industry. The suggestion made here is that market participants  would find it to be in their best interests to incorporate these factors into their models or run the risk of  failing to price in an important consideration.  One theoretical framework that supports this hypothesis is that of institutionalization. March  and Olsen (1999) define an institution as "a relatively stable collection of practices and rules defining  appropriate behavior for specific groups of actors in specific situations." Institutionalization is therefore  the theory that organizations must adhere to certain behavioural norms in the environments in which  they operate (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Given that commodity traders operate within a broader  business context that is beginning to internalize longterm environmental and social costs, it is likely  they will also follow. A key objective of this thesis is to determine which additional environmental  factors could be usefully incorporated into current models to more accurately forecast coffee and cocoa  yields in the context of climate change, and better understand the market dynamics that have tended to  discourage factoring longerterm variables into the models, and possible pathways to better integration.  The thesis is organized as follows: first, an overview of agricultural commodity trading is  provided in Section 2 to establish the market context in which coffee and cocoa operate. This section is  followed by a history of the coffee and cocoa markets in Section 3.1, and subsequently, by an  explanation of the role of the futures market in determining the international reference prices for coffee  and cocoa in Section 3.2. Section 4 details the environmental conditions necessary to produce coffee 

5   

and cocoa. With this background information articulated, an overview of the methodology is provided in  Section 5, followed by a review of the various crop forecasting models in Section 6. By comparing the  models developed in different disciplines in Section 7, an analysis of the key yield determinants is  undertaken. Conclusions, recommendations for improving the forecasting tools currently used by the  key industry players, and suggestions for further study are elaborated in Section 8. The thesis concludes  with an overview on its contribution to the academic literature. 

2. Commoditytrading:AnIntroductoryPrimer
For the purposes of this thesis, before providing discussing the details of the coffee and cocoa markets,  it is useful to have a rudimentary understanding of how various agricultural commodities (e.g. wheat,  rice, corn, coffee, cocoa) are traded in the global marketplace. Agricultural commodities are traded on  two markets: the physical market and the financial market. The physical market involves commercial  actors (e.g. producers, traders, exporters, and end users) who buy and sell the commodity, while the  financial market trades derivative products ­ i.e. products that derive their value from the underlying  commodity ­ which provide commercial actors and investors a means of price discovery and risk  management.  The critical derivative instrument in global agricultural commodities trading on public  exchanges is a "futures" contract. "Futures" are financial contracts in which two parties agree on the  delivery of a specified amount of a physical commodity at a future date at a particular delivery point that  is licensed by the exchange. While only about 3% of futures contracts actually result in the physical  delivery of coffee and cocoa (CME Group, 2006), futures prices are used as reference prices for  commodities in the physical markets. However, even when the futures contract does not result in  physical delivery, it is often linked to the physical trade of a commodity by commercial players who wish  to hedge their physical trade. Hedging is a strategy whereby a commercial actor offsets his risk in the  physical market by taking an opposite position in the futures market. For example, a coffee farmer that  anticipates future coffee prices to fall as a result of an abundant harvest may enter a futures contract to  6   

receive a higher price for his crop than he would receive if he were to sell his coffee on the cash market.   For this reason, in the futures market, commercial players are called hedgers, while noncommercial  actors (e.g. hedge funds) are called speculators, as they take on the risk of the hedgers with the  expectation that they will capitalize on favourable price movements (CME Group, 2013). These players  determine their participation in the market by developing models to predict what global demand or  supply will be at a given point in time and therefore whether or not the futures contract price works to  their benefit.     Trading agricultural commodities through futures markets is a practice that dates back to the first  rice futures market in Dojima, Japan in 1722 and popularized by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)  between the 1840s and 1860s, when the telegraph and steamship drastically changed the flow of  information about supply and demand between continents (Baffes, 2011). Regulated exchanges, such as  CBOT, became the preferred avenue through which to trade commodities, as futures contracts  guarantee the delivery of a standardized quantity of product at a given date, for a price arranged prior  to delivery. Additionally, the exchanges set quality specifications to ensure standardization of the  commodity delivered through futures contracts and to eliminate the need for potential buyers to  physically assess product quality.  While the early players in the initial futures markets were those that had a commercial interest  in the trade of agricultural commodities, like coffee and cocoa, noncommercial interests have  increasingly played a role in price formation in recent history. The next two sections will provide an  overview of the development of the coffee and cocoa markets the role of the futures markets in  determining the price of these commodities.

3. Structureofthecoffeeandcocoamarkets
Coffee and cocoa were selected as the commodities of focus for this study, given the author's previous  experience of working with coffee farmers in Peru and cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire.  As commodities  for study, when compared with other agricultural commodities, coffee and cocoa are of interest for two  main reasons: the first being that they are perennial crops, which means that producers have less  flexibility to respond to price signals than farmers of annual crops, e.g. corn and wheat. While some  other traded soft commodities are also perennial crops ­ e.g. orange [juice] and cotton ­ coffee and  cocoa are unique in that their production is largely concentrated in 34 countries with similar climatic  conditions and are predicted to be highly affected by climate change (see Section 6.2). On a global scale,  the trade of coffee and cocoa is significant: the global coffee market is estimated to be worth USD 81  billion (Sharf, 2014), while the global chocolate industry is estimated at USD 110 billion (Torre and Jones,  2014). An estimated 25 million farmers earn their living from coffee production (Fairtrade Foundation,  n.d.), while 5.5 million farmers are involved in the production of cocoa (Fountain and HützAdams,  2015), the vast majority of whom are shareholders on less than 3 hectares of land. Concerns about  coffee sustainability are longstanding, as evidenced by the crop being the focus of some of the earliest  voluntary standards addressing social and environmental concerns. Coffee's price drop in the late 1980s  was the impetus for the development of the first Fairtrade standard, Max Havelaar; coffee was also  the  second agricultural crop to be certified by the Rainforest Alliance in 1995, followed shortly after by  cocoa in 1997 (Rainforest Alliance, n.d.). Coffee and cocoa markets share a similar history in their efforts  to fix prices in the 1960s1980s through international agreements, instigated by the imbalance between  the value captured by producer and consumer countries that persists today.  

3.1Historyofcoffeeandcocoatothepresentday
To understand the current challenges facing the coffee and cocoa markets, it is useful to understand  how these industries developed in the locations that they did and the institutions that were established 

8   

to support them. Given the nature of this study, particular attention will be paid to the trade  relationships and pricing mechanisms in five of the world's most important coffee and cocoa producing  countries: Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, Côte d'Ivoire, and Ghana.  3.11Coffee While coffee cultivation originates from Ethiopia and Central Africa, its trade during Muslim hajj  pilgrimages to Mecca resulted in its dispersion to Java, Indonesia, Persia, Turkey, Morocco, and Western  Africa in the late 15th and early 16th century (Topik, 2004). Coffee became a popular drink in the  Ottoman Empire in the 1550s, allowing it to be traded safely through roads and waterways within the  region. At the time, coffee was grown on small garden plots in Yemen and traded not as a commodity,  but rather, was treated as an additional source of income for farmers and therefore production levels  were low and supply was inconsistent (Topik, 2004). Coffee was purchased by Indian merchants who  exported it to the Middle East, Indian Ocean, North Africa, and Europe and controlled the price, which at  the time was unaffected by world demand (Topik, 2004). After encountering the crop during trade with  Muslim ports on the Persian Gulf and India, the Dutch introduced coffee to Java in the 1690s and forced  Indonesian farmers to sell coffee to the Dutch East India Company at a fixed price. The coffee was then  transported to the Netherlands, where it was auctioned off in Amsterdam and Rotterdam every six  months, then later every 3 months and, as of 1864, every month (Topik, 2004).    In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam gifted a coffee plant to King Louis XIV, who then planted it in 

the Royal Botanical Garden of Paris (NCA USA). The French introduced coffee from Yemen to the colony  of Reunion in 1715 and used slaves to grow coffee on large plantations, averaging 200 hectares (Topik,  2004). In 1723, a French naval brought coffee to the Americas, notably the French colonies of  Martinique and SaintDomingue (now Haiti), where coffee was also grown by slaves on large  plantations. In the years before and after the French Revolution, French colonies supplied 2/3 of the  world's coffee (Topik, 2004).  

9   

 

The French were also responsible for introducing coffee to Brazil, by way of a Portuguese 

Brazilian official who was gifted the coffee seeds after seducing the wife of the governor of French  Guiana in 1727 (Chanda, 2008). The availability of cheap fertile land and slave labour in Brazil allowed  coffee production to flourish on large plantations, notably in the Paraíba Valley, north and west of Rio  de Janeiro, and in the northeast (Skidmore, 2010). These cheap inputs also caused global coffee prices to  plummet after 1820 and remain low until the end of the century, allowing Brazil's exports to jump 75 fold between 1822 and 1899 (Topik, 2004). After the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the expansion of  Brazil's rail network in the south, coffee plantations were also established near Sao Paulo, which acted  as a hub for coffee exports, as well as a means of attracting European immigrants to work on the new  plantations (Topik, 2004). By the 19th century, nearly 80% of world coffee production could be attributed  to Brazil, with the country producing 5 times more coffee than the rest of the world combined by 1906.    Spanish Jesuits are credited with bringing coffee to Cuba, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, and Mexico in 

1748 and to Colombia in 1790 (Krishnamurthy, 2002). However, the Spanish elite's preference for  chocolate over coffee meant that there was a 5060 year lag between the crop's introduction and its rise  as a major export crop (Topik, 2004). This meant that the growth of coffee in Latin America primarily  occurred after the countries gained independence from Spain. Nonetheless, in some parts of Colombia,  early coffee plantations maintained the Spanish haciendastyle model, run by wealthy Bogota  merchants, whereas in other parts of the country, individual farmers began harvesting the crop on large  plantations (Roseberry et al., 1995). In 1879, the Colombian government passed the Coffee Act to  support and promote the development of the coffee sector, resulting in an increase in production from  6.42 million kilograms to 144 billion kilograms between 1880 and 1920 (FNC, 2000).    In the late 19th century, Continental Europe and the United States became the world's largest 

coffee consumers, although the UK profited heavily from coffee through reexports, insurance, and  trade (Topik, 2004). In 1870, the arrival of the telegraph connecting New York and London to the South 

10   

American coffeeproducing countries allowed for information about prices, demand, and supply to be  communicated. This predicated the construction of warehouses that stocked a significant portion of the  world's coffee, allowing importers to control trade and set prices (Topik, 2004). In response to concerns  about price speculation, which caused prices to spike in 1880, the world's first coffee futures market,  the New York Coffee Exchange, was created in 1882, providing more institutionalized access to  information (Topik, 2004). The establishment of this and later futures markets in consuming countries,  such as Germany, meant that Europeans and North Americans, rather than producer countries, were the  major beneficiaries of the profits from shipping, insurance, and exportation, as well as the roasting,  grinding, packaging, packing, and advertising stages that add 4050% of the value to the final sale of  coffee (Topik and Wells, 2010).    Recognizing the fact that, despite being the world's top coffee producer, Brazil did not control 

the coffee trade once the commodity left its borders, in 1906, the state of Sao Paulo implemented a  price stabilization mechanism, known as "valorization." In an attempt to raise international coffee  prices, the government withheld coffee stocks and also encouraged producers to reduce their  production by imposing levies on coffee farms (Thurston, 2013). Valorization was repeated in 1917 and  1921 and, following a bumper crop in 1927/28, the Sao Paulo Coffee Institute was established to serve  as a more permanent supplycontrol mechanism, and bought a considerable amount of coffee from the  domestic market. After failing to convince other coffee producing countries to agree to production  quotas, the Brazilian government burned 68.7 millions of bags of coffee between 193138 (Baffes et al.,  2005). In 1940, the InterAmerican Coffee Agreement saw Brazil join forces with other Latin American  coffee producers to fix trade quotas with the US, which saw the accord as a way of assuring that Latin  American countries remained in solidarity with the allies during WWII (Thurston, 2013). The 1940  agreement also served to establish greater authority for what would become one of the coffee  industry's most important institutions  Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers (FNC in 

11   

Spanish); the agreement allowed the FNC impose taxes on Colombian coffee farmers and create a  national coffee fund which would play an important role in stabilizing prices and investing the industry  (Ortiz, 1999).  Subsequent pacts and agreements ratified during the PanAmerican Conferences  introduced other elements of regulation to the coffee market, including the establishment of a  minimum price (FNC, 2010). Significant price fluctuations in the coffee markets during the Cold War  represented a potential political threat in the Latin American countries where the United States was  keen to exert its influence, leading to the signing of an International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in 1963  (Wild, 2004). Administered by the International Coffee Organization (ICO), the agreement allowed the  governments of producer and consumer countries to set export quotas in order to manage supply and in  turn achieve price stability by ensuring that the price of coffee was always between USD 1.20/pound  and USD 1.40/pound (Petchers and Harris, 2008). Producers were allowed to exceed their quotas to  meet demand only if the price rose above the ceiling. This quota system remained in place until 1989,  when the U.S. ­ the world's largest coffee consumer ­ decided to leave the agreement at the end of the  Cold War (Petchers and Harris, 2008). Petchers and Harris (2008) cite additional reasons for the  breakdown for the ICA, including: the struggle by producer countries to capture larger quotas, the  difficulty of accessing the coffee market by new entrants, and the selling of surplus coffee to nonICA  member countries, thereby undermining prices and member country trust. Ponte (2002) adds that the  trend toward market liberalization with in the Reagan/Thatcher era did not support pricefixing cartels  like the ICA and rising demand in nonICA member markets, like the Soviet Union, created a market for  nonICA coffee.    In fact, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, which wanted to purchase coffee 

without paying hard currency, supported the development of coffee production in nonICA countries,  notably Vietnam (Baffes et al., 2005). Because Vietnam was not a member of the ICA, it was not bound  by quota restrictions and could therefore increase its production output in the 1980s, allowing it to 

12   

begin its ascent to a global coffee powerhouse. While the initial farms were stateowned, reforms in the  late 1990s ­ such as land ownership and liberalized input and output markets ­ incentivized the  production of export crops by smallholders. Between 1993 and 2000, the land used for coffee  production increased fivefold, from 101,300 hectares to 561,000 hectares (World Bank, 2011).  Vietnam's coffee boom effectively quashed the efforts of other producer countries to control coffee  prices through the development of the Association of Coffee Producer Countries in the wake of the ICA  collapse.   Today, the production and processing of coffee remains concentrated in a few countries.  According to FAOStat (2013), Brazil produced 33% of the world's green coffee in 2013, while Vietnam,  Indonesia, and Colombia together produced 32% (see Figure 1).

Source: FAOStat, 2013  Brazil and Colombia dominate in the production of Arabica coffee, while the majority of Vietnamese and  Indonesian coffee is Robusta. The major producing countries all have strong institutions that provide  technical assistance and conduct coffee research, but only Colombia's FNC sets daily reference prices,  13   

linked to the international reference price, at which farmers are guaranteed to be able to sell their  coffee to the federation (FNC, 2010).  True to their historic roots, coffee production is characterized by  large, highlymechanized plantation estates in Brazil and Vietnam (some of which are still stateowned in  the latter), while it is dominated by smallholder farms elsewhere. Europe and the US continue to be the  largest consumers of coffee and it follows that 4 out of the 5 traders which account for approximately  40% of the world's traded coffee volumes ­ Neumann,  Ecom, Olam, Volcafe, and Louis Dreyfus ­ are  based in Europe (George, 2014).

Today, the agreement serves as an  industry forum in which member states can collaborate to improve production practices and promote  consumption (ICO; UNCTAD, 2011). The ICO continues to serve an important role in collecting and  disseminating statistics about global coffee production and trade.

3.12Cocoa While cocoa was first planted in Ghana by the Dutch in 1815 and Swiss in 1857, these early attempts  were unsuccessful in gaining traction in turning it into an export crop. The widespread cultivation of  cocoa in Ghana is attributed to an Accra native, Tetteh Quarshie, who brought cocoa pods home with  him in 1879 after travelling to the colony of Fernando Po (now part of Equatorial Guinea), and planting  them in the eastern part of the country. Farmers in the region bought seeds from him and planted their  own cocoa farms, first in the east and slowly in the west to take advantage of unused forest land.  Kolavalli and Vigneri (2011) summarize several factors that contributed to farmers' willingness cultivate  new land for cocoa production, notably:  ....a fall in the world price of palm oil after 1885, which pushed farmers to search for alternative  export crops; a boom in rubber exports in 1890, which provided the capital for the purchase of new  land; increasing population pressure in the Akuapem area, which encouraged commercial farmers  to go further afield in search of alternative export agriculture opportunities; and the establishment  of European producebuying companies on the coast of West Africa that were prepared to trade the  new crop.  The establishment of these farms attracted migrant workers ­ both domestic and from the neighbouring  countries of Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Niger, and Mali ­ who worked the land under a  sharecropping arrangement in which they were paid onethird of the price of the cocoa harvested  (Kolavalli and Vigneri, 2011). Cocoa profits were invested into new plantations in the west and the  industry benefited from the country's new road and rail system in the 1920s.    In the postwar years, cocoa prices rose sharply, as speculators took out loans to purchase and 

hoard cocoa, limiting the availability of physical supply. In 1921, the speculators flooded the market with  cocoa in an attempt to repay their loans and the price of cocoa crashed, resulting in significant losses for  many cocoa market participants. Recognizing the stability provided by cotton and wheat futures  markets and the significant financial risks involved in transporting cocoa between producer and  consumer countries, the New York Cocoa Exchange was established in 1925 as the world's first cocoa  futures market (Commodity Research Bureau, 1959). 

15   

Britain established the first cocoa marketing board in Ghana in 1947 to ensure access to the  commodity, as well as to stabilize prices (Williams, 2009). Like other marketing boards established by  the British in West Africa, the board abused its power by taking resources away from the cocoa sector;  rather than using the income earned by paying farmers less than the world price to stabilize prices, the  money was used for industrialization, stemming inflation, and promoting economic diversification  (Williams, 2009). In 1952, and then again in 1961, the Ghanaian government established cocoabuying  companies which gave it complete buying power over the country's cocoa crop. Between Ghana's  independence in 1957 and the early 1990s, Ghanaian cocoa farmers were only paid 3050% of the free  on board (FOB) price, compared to 6080% that Brazilian, Malaysian, Cameroonian, and Ivoirian farmers  received during the same period (Williams, 2009). Low producer prices led to a decline in production,  culminating in a record low output in the 1983/84 season, when farmers received only 29% of the FOB  price. The same year, the government began to make a series of important reforms that shaped the  current national cocoa board, Cocobod, notably: cutting down the administration of the cocoa board in  order to increase prices received by Ghanaian farmers and ending the state monopsony by allowing  private companies to compete with the recently privatized staterun cocoa purchasing company  (Williams, 2009). This agreement remains in place to the current day so it is worth clarifying that the  private companies do not operate in a fully liberalized environment; rather, they must purchase cocoa  from producers at the producer rate and sell the cocoa at a fixed rate to Cocobod, which handles quality  control and export to the international market. In the context of regulated pricing, producers are  incentivized to sell to the private companies based on the inputs and services they provide, although it is  worth noting that Cocobod has a significant mass spraying program and offers highlysubsidized inputs  to Ghanaian farmers.  The producer price is determined on an annual basis by Cocobod's Producer Price  Review Committee based on projected world FOB prices, the projected exchange rate between the US  Dollar and Ghanaian Cedi, and the projected crop size (Quartey, 2013).  

16   

Similar to Ghana, the first cocoa trees were introduced to Côte d'Ivoire by European missionaries in  1880, though widespread cultivation did not pick up until many years later (de Planhol, 1947). In 1908,  the governor of the colony, Angoulvant, began a campaign of forced cocoa cultivation using locally  available labor (i.e. slaves). As the locals were not financially motivated by this program, production  suffered and, to remedy this, the French colonial government brought in expat workers and supplied  them with forced labor (Hopkins, 2014). This model continued until slavery was abolished in the colony  in 1946, at which point, local Ivorians rapidly took over cocoa production and promptly replaced the  expat workers (Hopkins, 2014).   Following rapid expansion of cocoa production, the French established the Caisse de Stabilisation, a  price stabilization mechanism, in Côte d'Ivoire. The Caisse was dismantled in 1999 as part of a series of  liberalization efforts promoted by the IMF and World Bank, resulting in an abandonment of price  setting. While the cocoa industry prospered despite political instability in the country between 1999 and  2010, new reforms were brought in by the postcivil war government to boost the industry. In 2012  following the model established by their Ghanian neighbours, a new Ivorian cocoa board ­ le Conseil du  CaféCacao (CCC) ­ was founded. The role of the CCC was ­ and continues to be to this day ­ to establish  a price stabilization mechanism for farmers in response to concerns about volatility and to establish a  marketing mechanism to control the sale of 7080% of the country's cocoa crop through auctions. The  CCC guarantees a minimum price of 60% of the CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) price.   Similar to the coffee market, cocoa price volatility gave rise to the International Cocoa  Agreement (ICCA), which regulated the cocoa trade from 19731990, and was administered by the  International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Like the ICA, the ICCA used an export quota scheme and a pre determined price range between USD 0.23/pound and USD 0.32/pound to stabilize the market (Dand,  1997). Unlike the ICA, the ICCA had a "buffer stock" provision of 250,000 tonnes which was used to  meet demand in excess of the agreed upon quotas (Dand, 1997). 

17   

The agreements broke down largely due to lack of cooperation between member countries.  Dand's (1997) history of the ICCA suggests a gradual breakdown of the cocoa agreement: the third  iteration of the ICCA in 1980 was a turning point for the cocoa industry in that it abandoned the quota  system and determined the price band based on the availability of buffer stock, effectively raising the  intervention prices. Additionally, several key market participants decided not to join the third  agreement, notably: the United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, New Zealand, the Philippines,  Malaysia, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, St. Lucia, Togo, and Zaire. Though Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, and Togo  rejoined the agreement in its fourth iteration in 1986, the new agreement added a withholding scheme  to the buffer stock mechanism, which allowed for the withholding of 120,000 tonnes of cocoa from  exporting countries if the physical or financial capacity of the buffer stock was exhausted (Dand, 1997).  When the buffer stock surpassed its capacity in 1988, member states experienced difficulties in keeping  up with levy payments, which led to disagreements on the price provisions, effectively leading to the  dismantling of the ICCA's price stabilization mechanisms when the ICCA was extended in 1990.   Like the ICA, the ICCA remains in place without the market intervention provisions that had  previously allowed it to effectively regulate the cocoa market. The ICCO continues to serve an important  role in collecting and disseminating statistics about global cocoa production and trade, and as an  industry forum in which member states can collaborate to improve production practices and promote  consumption.  Currently, over 90% of cocoa is grown on smallholder farms, between 25 hectares in size.  Approximately 70% of world cocoa production is concentrated in West Africa with Côte d'Ivoire  accounting for 32% of world cocoa production, and Ghana, Indonesia, and Nigeria together producing  another 43% of global cocoa supply (FAOStat, 2013, Figure 3).

However, because of the multiple steps required to turn cocoa beans into a useable input for  confectionary and other products, the cocoa value chain is longer than the coffee supply chain: cocoa  beans need to be ground and processed into cocoa liquor and butter ­ usually at the source ­ before  being exported and sold to the chocolate manufacturers. As a result, producer countries benefit from  being able to participate in at least some of the processing that adds value to the final product;  approximately 45% of cocoa grinding is done in origin countries (ICCO, 2016).    

3.2Internationalcropreferenceprices
The history of the coffee and cocoa industries reveal a constant struggle between producer countries  and the international crop reference price, with several institutions and agreements established in the  20th century to protect producers from wild price fluctuations. In this context, it is worth investigating  what is the international crop reference price and how it is established. The price of coffee and cocoa is  determined by supply and demand in the futures markets, the most important of which are based in  New York and London. The ICE Futures U.S. Coffee "C", the Robusta Coffee, the U.S. Cocoa, and the  London Cocoa contracts are the world benchmark prices for Arabica coffee, Robusta Coffee, and cocoa,  respectively (Intercontinental Exchange, 2012a and 2012b). These exchanges are the product of multiple  mergers following the initial creation of the New York Coffee Exchange in 1882. To this day, the futures  market plays a central role in price discovery, price risk transfer, and price dissemination for coffee and  cocoa (NYBOT, 2004).   One Coffee "C" contract represents 37,500 pounds of coffee, while Robusta and Cocoa contracts  represent 10,000 tonnes. There are five Cocoa and Coffee "C" contracts throughout the year (March,  May, July, September, December) and six Robusta contracts (January, March, May, July, September,  November). Cocoa contracts can be purchased up to 23 months in advance, while Arabica contracts can  be purchased 35 months in advance, and Robusta up to 18 months in advance.  

20   

When discussing the price of commodities, it is important to differentiate between the spot  price and the cash price. The spot price is the price of the futures contract if it were sold today, whereas  the cash price or the physical price, is the price at the time of delivery and can be calculated by adding  the spot price plus the differential (also called the basis), which adjusts for the perceived quality, origin,  and point of delivery of the coffee and cocoa (Dand, 1997). To ensure standardization across markets,  specific requirements for the number of defects, amount of foreign matter, size and weight of coffee  and cocoa beans have been established by the exchanges to determine the premiums and discounts for  the Coffee "C", Robusta, and London Cocoa Futures Contracts. The Coffee "C" and U.S. and London  Cocoa contracts also specify certain price premiums and discounts for countries of origin:  TABLE 1: COFFEE "C" (ARABICA) PRICE DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS BY COUNTRY  Countries  Discount()/Premium(+) per pound

The indicator prices published on a daily basis by the International Coffee and Cocoa  Organizations represent the cash prices in their respective markets. The International Coffee  Organization calculates the price of each coffee grouping by averaging the exdock prices paid in the  physical markets in the US, Germany, and France, weighted based on the market share that each  country represents: e.g. for Colombian Milds, the US prices account for 46% of the indicator price, while  the EU markets account for 56% (ICO, 2011). The ICO Daily Composite Indicator Price, which represents  the price for all coffee, is calculated as a weighted average of all four coffee groups: 12% Colombian  Milds, 23% Other Milds, 31% Brazilian Naturals, and 34% Robustas (ICO, 2011).  In contrast, the  International Cocoa Organization daily price for cocoa is calculated by averaging the futures prices of the  three nearest active trading months on the ICE London Cocoa Futures and the ICE Futures US at the time  of closing on the London exchange.   As the focus of this study is on the price discovery models used by futures market participants, it  is important to clarify who constitutes a market participant, amongst the many actors in the coffee and  cocoa industries (see Figures 5 and 6). Commercial players, which hedge their physical coffee and cocoa  trade using futures, include: producer organizations, national coffee/cocoa boards, coffee roasters,  cocoa grinders, and chocolate manufacturers. Speculators include a variety of investors, such as hedge  funds and index funds that have commodity exposure.   While commercial players account for the  majority of open interest contracts ­ i.e. contracts that have not been closed out ­ in the coffee and 

22   

cocoa markets, they account for a smaller percentage of trades. For example, an 11year study of the  NYBOT Cocoa Futures market [the predecessor to the ICE U.S. Cocoa Futures market] found that  hedgers accounted for 69% of open contracts but only settled 8% of their positions at the end of the  trading session, while spectators accounted for 16% of open interest and settled 24% of their trades  (Nardella, 2007).

Figures 5 and 6 reveal that there are many similarities between the structure of the coffee and cocoa  markets, although there are a few key differences. Notably, the cocoa supply chain is slightly longer, and  therefore involves more actors, due to the fact that cocoa requires more processing prior to becoming a  useable product in chocolate and confectionary. Additionally, in the cocoa supply chain, national cocoa  boards in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire effectively control the export of cocoa from the two largest cocoa producing countries. While coffee boards are present in some of the minor coffeegrowing countries,  the major coffeeproducing countries are primarily organized by industry associations, which play less of  a commercial and more of a supportive role (e.g. improving farmer yields, improving quality). Both  commodities are embedded in systems where there is significant concern about the sustainability of  crop production, as evidenced by the numerous projects aimed at developing new varietals and  24   

improving productivity, supervised by the International Coffee and Cocoa Organizations, as well as  numerous NGOs. Social and environmental thirdparty standards that are recognizable to consumers ­  e.g. Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Organic ­ also provide training to coffee and cocoa producers, which  can be significant in countries where governmentsupported technical assistance is minimal. In the  cocoa sector, one NGO, the World Cocoa Foundation, is leading an industrywide initiative called  CocoaAction that brings together public (e.g. USAID and ACDI/VOCA) and private (e.g. Barry Callebaut,  Cargill, Ecom) actors to address key challenges, such as soil fertility and child labour, and develop  climate change adaptation strategies.  

4. PlantPhenologyandEnvironmentalConditionsforCoffeeandCocoa Production
  Having reviewed the market dynamics, it is also useful to understand the physical elements of the coffee  and cocoa plants that allow them to produce the crops that are widely traded and consumed. This  section will elaborate on plant phenology and the environmental conditions that allow coffee and cocoa  to grow in their respective countries. The fact that coffee and cocoa are tropical commodities whose  production is largely concentrated in 34 countries in similar climatic conditions makes them ideal  subjects for a Master's thesis, where limits on scope can assist in evaluating various environmental  factors. 

4.1Cocoa
 

Environmental  conditions 
Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is a crop that is typically grown within 10° north or south of the Equator  due to its requirements for hot, humid conditions (although the plant has been cultivated at latitudes as  far as 20° north or south). Notably, cocoa can only be grown in environments with a maximum annual  25   

temperature of 30  32°C and a minimum average temperature of 18  21°C (ICCO, 2013), as higher  temperatures can exceed the physiological tolerances of the plant and low temperatures, below 10°C,  damage the seedlings during sprouting (FiBL, 2011). In addition to requiring a highly humid environment   100% relative humidity during the day and 7080% at night  cocoa production is also depending on  heavily rainfall during the year, between 15002000mm annually (ICCO, 2013). As the cocoa plant is  highly watersensitive, rainfall of less than 100mm per month over a period of three or more months will  result in poorer yields (ICCO, 2013), although a short dry period is necessary to protect the plant against  fungal diseases, like black pod (FiBL, 2011). Although cocoa grows naturally in the rainforest and is  therefore welladapted to shaded conditions, new cocoa cultivars have been developed to grow in full sun conditions. Cocoa grows best in soils up to 1.5m in depth, with 3.5% organic matter in the top 15cm  and a nitrogentophosphorus ratio of around 1.5, ideally with a pH of 5.07.5 (ICCO, 2013). The  optimum altitude for cocoa growth is 100250 masl (CIAT, 2011), although cocoa can be grown at higher  altitudes around the Equator, e.g. in Uganda at 1400 masl (FiBL, 2011). 

Crop  lifecycle 
It takes 35 years from when the cocoa tree is planted to the first harvest. When the tree is strong  enough to bear fruit, thousands of pink and white flowers form on the trunk and branches; after the  flowers are pollinated by insects, some flowers will produce young pods, called cherelles (Dand, 1997).  The tree will undergo a process called cherelle wilt, which reduces the number of cherelles that become  full, mature pods after approximately 6 months (Dand, 1997). Of the some 10,000 flowers that form on  the cocoa tree each year, only 1050 will develop into pods. These phenological processes are important  in that they influence some of the most important physiological yield determinants: fruit morphology,  photosynthesis, and maintenance respiration (Zuidema et al., 2005 and Almeida and Valle, 2007). 

26   

Cocoa has two harvest seasons (Figure 7), a midcrop ­ which generally accounts for 1520% of  production ­ and a main crop, which generally occurs 56 months after the start of the wet season  (ICCO, 2014). After a tree begins to bear fruit, it takes 5 years for it to reach its peak productivity period,  which continues for another 10 years before it begins to decline. Cocoa has a productive lifespan of  approximately 25 years, although can bear fruit for up to 50 years.  FIGURE 7: TIMING OF HARVEST SEASON AND RAINY SEASON IN LARGE COCOAPRODUCING COUNTRIES

4.2Coffee
Environmental  conditions 
While there are approximately 100 species of the coffee genus (Coffea), Arabica (C. arabica) and  Robusta (C. canephora) account for 99% of the world's coffee production (DaMatta and Ramalho, 2006).  Native to the highlands of Ethiopia, Arabica coffee is typically grown at higher altitudes of 1600 2800masl, while Robusta is from the lowlands of the Congo Basin and grows between sea level and  800masl (Camargo, 2010). Consistently, the ideal mean annual temperature range for Arabica growth is  lower than Robusta ­ 18  21°C vs. 2226°C (Alegre, 1959, as cited in DaMatta et al., 2007). While some  varieties of Arabica can adapt to temperatures as high as 2425°C, quality usually suffers in  temperatures over 23°C and its growth is inhibited at temperatures of less than 1718°C (DaMatta et al.,  2007). Both species thrive in an optimum annual rainfall range of 12001800mm, though Robusta can  27   

adapt to more intense rainfall exceeding 2000m (Alegre, 1959 and Coste, 1992, as cited in DaMatta et  al., 2007). Likewise, Robusta coffee can grow in more humid environments than Arabica, which needs  less humidity. Both species require a dry season of 34 months that coincides with the coolest period of  the year (Camargo, 2010). 

Crop  lifecycle 
Unlike cocoa, which grows in a cauliflorous manner (i.e. the flowers grow from the trunk and branches),  sexually mature coffee trees (approximately 3 years old), form nodes on their branches, which then turn  into leaves (DaMatta et al., 2007). On these same branches, buds begin to form, which flower following  the first rains proceeding the dry season (DaMatta et al., 2007). Not all buds begin to flower at the same  time and up to 4 blossoming periods have been observed in major coffeeproducing regions, such as  Brazil, depending on water availability (Figure 8). Once the flowers open up, they are pollinated, which  initiates the developmental stage of the fruit. It takes 89 months for a flower to become a ripe cherry.  Similar to cocoa, coffee trees take about three years to begin producing fruit, after which it takes  approximately 5 years to reach peak production, which continues for 20 years before beginning to  decline (Wickens and Greenfield, 1973).

  The foregoing background information on commodities trading, the evolution of the cocoa and coffee  markets, and the phenology and environmental conditions for cocoa and coffee production sets the  stage for an analysis of the various crop forecasting models developed in the academic literature and by  the market participants. 

5. Methodology
 

29   

It will be recalled that a key objective of this Master's thesis is to better understand whether additional  longerterm environmental factors can and should be incorporated into supply forecasting models used  by coffee and cocoa market participants to better reflect evolving growing conditions. In order to  understand what additional data could be added, it was first necessary to understand what is already  accounted for in current models. A review of media articles and academic literature was conducted and  produced little in the way of granular details concerning current models, probably due to the  proprietary nature of these models. However, some highlevel themes ­ such as rainfall, extreme  weather events, and pests and disease ­ were frequently cited as causes of fluctuations in the coffee  and cocoa futures markets.   The suggestion made here is that coffee and cocoa output is not simply a  function of shortterm environmental shocks but is also influenced by longerterm evolving  environmental conditions, such as climate change and deteriorating soil conditions, which may not be  considered in current shortterm oriented pricing models given their more gradual effects on yield.     In the absence of detailed information being accessible concerning current models used by 

cocoa and coffee market participants, a multidisciplinary and comprehensive review of crop yield  forecasting literature was conducted by the author. Specifically, models from the fields of economics,  econometrics, agroforestry, and ecophysiology were studied. This exercise served a dual purpose in  first better understanding modelling systems across different disciplines and secondly in assisting in  revealing the most important economic and environmental factors that affect coffee and cocoa yield  outcomes. The findings of this literature review are discussed in Section 6.     In addition to the media and literature reviews mentioned above, a critical piece of the study 

was the execution of 15 semistructured, openended interviews with key coffee and cocoa market  participants, including investors, traders, roasters, processors, and intergovernmental organizations (see  Appendix A for survey questions). These institutions were chosen because they represent both types of  players on the futures markets: speculators and hedgers (see Section 2). To determine which

speculators should be included as interview participants, media searches were conducted to identify  investors who were considered experts in a given commodity and whose models were based on the  fundamentals of the coffee or cocoa industry (i.e. as opposed to quantitative strategies, which do not  consider market fundamentals). With the exception of one hedge fund and one bank, the non commercial actors interviewed were specialized commodity research houses that provide fundamental  analysis to the investor community, as well as commercial actors. Hedgers were selected for interviews  based on an analysis conducted to identify the largest coffee and cocoa traders and processors by  market share. In general, interviewees held the position of head researcher, economist, or trader at  their particular institution. The purpose of conducting interviews was to access information about the  proprietary models that is not publically reported. The semistructured interview format was chosen  over unstructured or structured interviews as it provided focus through a predetermined set of  questions but also allowed for further probing to delve into a given subject. Qu and Dumay (2011) also  note that the semistructured interview "enables interviewees to provide responses in their own terms  and in the way that they think and use language." This flexibility was necessary given the diversity of  actors interviewed and the differences in their models (e.g. type of commodity, time horizon, etc.). The  semistructured interview approach was approved by the Ryerson Research Ethics Board.  Following the completion of all interviews, the results were analyzed and compared to the  environmental factors cited as affecting coffee and cocoa yields in the academic literature. This analysis  allowed for the identification of gaps between the environmental factors in the models used by industry  players and those used in forecasting models of other disciplines. Based on the outcome of this  comparison, recommendations were developed for the inclusion of environmental factors that may be  incorporated into the industry players' models to improve accuracy. Where possible, the  recommendations also included the expected impact of these indicators on crop yield as per the  literature review findings.

6.1Econometric
Econometric models of crop yield tend to be fairly homocentric in that they view the producer's decision  to plant as being the primary determinant of crop supply and perceive price to be the main factor which  affects the producer's decision. Once the producer determines how many units of each crop he wants to  plant, econometricians model crop yield using a production function in which the producer is limited by  labour and available capital (acreage and technology), with little to no consideration of the  environmental constraints that may affect crop yield. The econometrics literature generally only  mentions weather and climate variables in discussions of whether they are exogenous or endogenous to  econometrics models of crop yield. Several papers note that weather and climate variables are  important but data is not readily available or accessible.   In 1956, Marc Nerlove introduced the idea of farmers deciding how much of a crop to plant not  based on current prices, but on the price they expect to receive for the crop at harvest time, which is  only dependent to a limited extent on current prices. Future crop supply, therefore, can be determined  by estimating quantities from futures prices, lagged prices, or prices using an autoregressive model.  Using Nerlove's approach, supply shocks due to weather events are considered exogenous to the model,  as are potential future supply shocks due to weather. It is important to note that Nerlove's model was  developed for annual crops, which are planted and harvested yearly.  Bateman (1965) followed the Nerlovian approach in trying to develop a supply function for  cocoa, a perennial crop, assuming that cocoa farmers' future price expectations are based on current  prices. Bateman states that the farmer's motivations for planting cocoa and the relationship between  32   

acres planted and output harvested are the two main determinants of cocoa yield, although notes that   acreage data isn't available and therefore hasn't been incorporated in his model. Bateman is one of the  few econometricians to incorporate cocoa tree physiology in his model by considering the changes in  crop yield output due to tree age, as well as climatic factors by considering rainfall. Bateman's model  accounts for a lag period between when the cocoa is planted and when it starts to bear fruit (after  approximately 8 years), as well as the second increase in yield after 1213 years (Bateman 1965).The  model also considers the importance of rainfall during the main cocoa flowering and fruiting periods in  Ghana in determining crop yield. Bateman notes that rainfall also affects humidity, which in turn may  produce ideal conditions for "black pod" disease to develop.  Bateman found that producers responded  differently to prices depending on the soil quality of the region, with farmers operating on Class I soils  being less elastic than those operating on Class III soils. His model produced different price elasticities  for farmers depending on soil quality, rainfall, and humidity in the areas in which they were operating.  In 1973, Wickens and Greenfield attempted to build upon Nerlove's model to make it applicable  to tree crops, such as coffee and cocoa, which take several years to produce fruit. They concluded that  Nerlove's model was therefore not as successful for tree crops as for field crops because it did not  account for the long lag in productivity. Wickens and Greenfield divided the supply function of their  model into 3 parts which explain the structural relationships underlying coffee supply: the investment  function, the harvesting decision, and the vintage production function. They note that the reason the  model not usually built this way is because of data deficiencies. The investment function shows that the  potential production is equal to the number of trees times the average yield of these trees. However, it  is difficult to measure the discounted net revenue from production because the productivity of a tree  changes over time. Coffee trees take about 3 years to bear fruit, then takes another 5 years to reach  peak production, they have a further life of about 20 years, and then yields begin to decline. Therefore,  they developed different lag coefficients for years 09.   33   

In 2013, Roberts and Schlenker challenged the Nerlovian model, arguing that futures markets  incorporate production expectations and therefore the futures price is endogenous to supply.  Environmental "shocks" are included as instrumental variables in that they affect inventory, which  affects futures prices (Roberts and Schlenker, 2013). Roberts and Schlenker approximate weather shocks  using deviations of yield from trend and apply their model to the world's supply of calories incurred  from maize, soybeans, wheat, and rice from 1961­2007. In addition to using yield shocks as an  endogenous component, the authors perceive weather variables ­ average temperature and total  precipitation ­ as exogenous. They concluded: "we found it more practical to use yield shocks  (deviations from time trends of output per land unit) instead of using weather directly, which gives a  weaker first stage as global annual production has to be linked to aggregate annual weather measures.  We obtain similar point estimates using both weather and yield shocks. The use of weather variables  instead of yield shocks may be a promising direction for future research. To make such an approach  viable will require rich weather data and a parsimonious model linking weather to yield." (pg. 2292)  Hendricks et al. (2014) argue that instrumental variables are unnecessary in crop supply  forecasting models because shocks are somewhat predictable and therefore are factored into other  components of supply change elasticity, namely total growing area and the composition of growing area  across crops and countries. Therefore, the authors suggest adding the yield shock to regressions of  growing area and model different regression equations for total growing area and the trend yield to  show how adding or removing shocks makes minimal difference in the outcome. They note: "Futures  markets can incorporate additional information about exogenous factors affecting planted area--such  as excess rainfall preventing planting--at the time of planting rather than in the months preceding  planting." (pg. 8)

6.2AgriculturalSciences
The scientific literature review was focused primarily on studies that were able to quantify the impacts  of different environmental factors on coffee and cocoa yield output. As the purpose of this thesis is to  assess the viability of including additional environmental variables in coffee and cocoa forecasting  models, the literature review focused on studies that have global applicability, or at least were relevant  to the major coffee and cocoaproducing countries, rather than localized case studies. Within the  agricultural science literature, multiple types of models have been developed to predict crop yield which  generally take into account weather and climactic variables. The majority of relevant articles focused on  the response of plant internal chemistry (physiology) and biological development (phenology, which is  influenced by physiology) to the surrounding environment and were generally classified as  "ecophysiological models," although studies that focused on largescale shifts in climate suitability  tended to use the term "agrometeorological models." There is also a significant body of work focused  on assessing the impact of shade on coffee and cocoa yields, which tend to be categorized as "agro forestry models." While the nomenclature is not especially relevant to this work, it is worth mentioning,  if only to underscore the fact that many of these models often include the same inputs but are  sometimes operating in silos. As such, rather than discussing the models by type, the review of the  scientific literature will be organized by the environmental factors that were deemed to be most  relevant in forecasting coffee and cocoa yields: rainfall, temperature, atmospheric carbon, El Niño and  La Niña events, shade and soil.  Rainfall The timing and quantity of rainfall appeared prominently in the coffee and cocoa literature. While some  studies focused explicitly on the yield impacts of these factors (e.g. Zuidema et al., 2005 and Alvim,  1988), others signaled that changes in precipitation would affect the suitability of areas currently being  used for cocoa and coffee cultivation (e.g. Craparo et al., 2015 and CIAT, 2011).  35   

 

The cocoa literature emphasizes two key points related to rainfall: the amount of rainfall during 

pod production significantly affects the yield at harvest time and climate change is predicted to change  precipitation patterns in West Africa, where approximately 70% of cocoa is grown. Zuidema et al. (2005)  found that annual radiation and rainfall during the two driest months of the crop cycle accounted for  70% of the variation in bean yield, echoing Alvim's (1988) finding that there is a positive correlation  between cocoa yield and rainfall up to 6 months before the harvest period. Mariano and Monteiro  (1962, as referenced in Almeida and Valle, 2007) found that pod production decreased by 60% after a  multiweek flooding. Given that the timing of precipitation is relevant to cocoa yields, it is significant  that Owusu and Waylen (2013) were able to show that changes in seasonal rainfall have already started  to occur in Ghana. Notably, between the time periods 19511970 and 19812000, Owusu and Waylen  (2013) observed shorter rainy seasons and reductions in rainfall of 20mm80mm during both the major  and minor rainy seasons. These findings are consistent with one of the most widelycited studies on  climate suitability for cocoa, which predicts that by 2050 in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, there will be less  monthly and yearly rainfall, with a decrease in the number of dry months from 4 to 3 (CIAT, 2011). While  other climate models for West Africa predict decreases in precipitation (Held et al., 2005; Laux et al.,  2008; Adiku and Stone, 1995), some predict increases (Haarsmaa et al., 2005); Dietz et al. (2004) and  Minia (2004) indicate that wetter areas will become wetter and drier areas will become drier.  Christiansen et al. (2007) anticipate a 20% increase in highintensity rainfall events, flooding, and very  wet seasons in West Africa. Given the importance of the timing of rainfall, these predictions are likely to  negatively impact the suitability of Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire as cocoagrowing regions.    The coffee literature emphasized the timing of rain, as "relatively modest changes in rainfall 

have little or no relation to the longerterm yield and production variability" (Craparo et al., 2015). Yet,  coffee is not a very droughtresistant crop; only some cultivars can survive 67 months without rain at  the expense of strong declines in yield (DaMatta and Ramalho, 2006). As such, the distribution of rainfall  36   

during the coffee lifecycle is critical. Rainfall dispersed over many days during the flowering period  causes unsynchronized fruit ripening following the dry, dormant period (Craparo et al., 2015 and  DaMatta et al., 2007). Because of this effect, in a study conducted by Craparo et al. (2015), yield was  negatively correlated to a higher number of days of rainfall during the flowering period. Similarly, by  analyzing the influence of temperature and rainfall on key stages of the coffee lifecycle in Brazil, Dos  Santos and Camargo (2006) found that the most important variable in predicting yield was water  availability during the flowering and coffee bean formation phases of the coffee lifecycle (Dos Santos  and Camargo, 2006). Because of the importance of rainfall at these critical stages of the coffee lifecycle,  the coffee literature ­ similar to the cocoa literature ­ indicates that changing rainfall distribution and  quantity may negatively affect coffee yields. One coffee climate suitability model predicted, by 2050, a  decrease in the number of dry months from 6 to 5 in Central America, from 7 to 6 months in South  Africa, and from 5 to 4 months in East Africa, while the Andes would see an increase in the number of  dry months from 1 to 2, and there would be no change in Brazil (OvalleRivera et al., 2015). However,  the latter two regions would experience changes in the amount of precipitation: an estimated decrease  of 50mm during the dry season in Brazil and an increase of 100170mm during the wet season in the  Andes (OvalleRivera et al., 2015).  Temperature The literature on temperature focuses primarily the extreme cold and hot limits that coffee and cocoa  can withstand (e.g. DaMatta and Ramalho, 2006), as minimal evidence exists that slight changes in  temperature have an effect on yield. As such, many of the reviewed works focused on the potential  climate suitability for coffee and cocoa in key producer regions in light of the anticipated climate change  effects (e.g. CIAT, 2011 and OvalleRivera et al., 2015). For example, a 2011 study by the International  Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) on the impact of climate change on cocoagrowing regions in  Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire found that under current IPCC climate change predictions, by 2050, the average 

37   

annual temperature will increase by 2.1°C and the optimum altitude at which to grow cocoa will rise  from its current optimal level of 100250 metres above sea level to 450500 masl (CIAT, 2011). Of all the  bioclimatic variables analyzed, the authors concluded that the temperature of the warmest month was  the most important factor in determining climate suitability for cocoa production, accounting for 25.3%  of the change in suitability (CIAT, 2011).     Some of the same CIAT authors replicated the climate suitability model for Arabica coffee in 19 

countries. OvalleRivera et al. (2015) used 19 bioclimatic variables, which were primarily focused on  temperatures and precipitation levels at various times of the year, to predict climate suitability in 2050,  using the 21 global circulation models (GCM) in the IPCC's fourth assessment report for scenario A2a.  Using the most pessimistic GCMs, 33% of current coffee area would lose 40% climate suitability and half  of the coffee area would lose 2040% suitability; the most optimistic scenario found that 34% of the  current coffee area would lost 1040% suitability and the median scenario showed a loss of 2040%  suitability for 37% of the current coffee area and a loss of 1020% suitability for 27% of the coffee area  (OvalleRivera et al., 2015). The authors found that current coffee growing areas at lower altitudes  would generally experience the most significant decline in climate suitability, which is most concerning  for countries that do not have any land at high altitudes, such as Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Brazil  (OvalleRivera et al., 2015). On the other hand, countries with mountainous areas such as Peru, Ecuador,  Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Costa Rica would gain climate suitability at higher  elevations, which may offset the losses at lower altitudes (OvalleRivera et al., 2015, Table 5).

for Nicaragua (Laderach et al., 2010), México (Morales et al., 2013 and Schroth et al, 2009), El Salvador,  Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala (Haggar et al., 2011 and Laderach et al., 2010), Brazil, Tanzania and  Vietnam (Haggar et al., 2011) and Indonesia (Schroth et al., 2014). Outside of the CIAT group, Camargo  conducted a similar review for Brazil (2008).  The papers that focused on the physiological impacts of temperature changes highlighted the  impacts of temperature extremes but were less alarmist about the effects of changing temperatures on  coffee yields. Coffee is very sensitive to cold weather and photosynthesis almost stops entirely when the  temperature reaches 510°C; even a few days being exposed to cold weather can inhibit CO2 uptake  (Larcher, 1981 as cited in DaMatta and Ramalho, 2006). High temperatures during the flowering period  may halt blossoming (Camargo, 1985), while extremely high temperatures during photosynthesis may  cause the fruit to grow faster than the photosynthetic resources available, resulting in smaller cherries  (Dos Santos et al., 2015). However, if coffee is exposed gradually to cold or hot weather, the coffee plant  39   

might be able to acclimate (Quartin et al., 2004 and DaMatta, 2004). For this reason, DaMatta and  Ramalho (2006) were skeptical about the findings of a 1968 study conducted under controlled and  constant conditions that observed a 10% decrease in Arabica yield for every 1°C increase in temperature  above 24°C (Nunes et al., 1968).   Despite these models, a recent study was able to prove that climate change has already had a  negative effect on Arabica coffee yields in Tanzania. By observing climate variables between 1961 and  2012, Craparo et al. (2015) found that increasing nighttime temperature, or minimum temperature,  was the single most important factor in declining coffee yields. Based on this result, the authors predict  that every 1°C increase in minimum temperature will result in annual crop yield losses of 137±16.87 kg  ha-1 (Craparo et al., 2015). While similar analysis has yet to be done on a global level, the findings of this  paper are significant in light of minimum temperatures increasing faster than average temperatures,  particularly in countries like Tanzania, whose minimum temperature is on the cusp of suitability for  coffee growth.  AtmosphericCarbon There is evidence to suggest that the impact of increasing temperatures on coffee might be mitigated by  rising atmospheric carbon, which is expected to increase by 450600 L L1 by the year 2050 and  between 730 and 1020 L L1 by 2100 (Dos Santos et al., 2015). Ramalho (cited in Dos Santos et al.,  2015) found that under enhanced CO2 conditions of 700 L L1 photosynthesis in coffee plants was  unaffected up to a temperature of 37°C. Similarly, Ghini et al. (2015) found that under higher CO2  conditions (550 mol mol1) yields increased by 14.6% and 12% for coffee cultivars Catuaí and Obatã.  Van Oijen et al. (2010a) found that doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased coffee  production and carbon sequestration, which also made nitrogen fertilization more effective. While the  cocoa literature did not emphasize atmospheric carbon as a significant contributor to yield, as a C3 

40   

plant, higher atmospheric carbon will increase the plant's photosynthetic rate, which can have a yield  impact ­ albeit one that has not yet been quantified.   ElNiño/LaNiña A study conducted by the International Cocoa Organization analyzed the impact of El Niño and La Niña  weather events on global cocoa supply between 1950 and 2008. The study found that El Niño weather  events reduced world cocoa supply by 2.43%, resulting in a corresponding price increase of 1.66%, while  La Niña events did not have a significant impact on world cocoa supply (ICCO, 2010). However, El Niño  events impacted the cocoa yields of some countries more than others; notably, El Niño resulted in a  decrease of cocoa supply in Ecuador by 6.16, in Indonesia by 2.39%, in Côte d'Ivoire by 2.03%, in Ghana  by 1.72%, and in Nigeria by 1.15% (ICCO, 2010). In only one country did the study find that La Niña had a  statistically significant impact on cocoa yield, with an increase of 1.68% observed in Papua New Guinea,  which the authors attribute to reduced pests and disease (ICCO, 2010). On another note, the study  found that 17 El Niño and 13 La Niña events between 1950 and 2008 affected cocoa supply over 18  cocoa cycles, meaning that the impact of some of the events lasted more than one season. The authors  highlight that one limitation of the study was the use of annual cocoa production figures, rather than  monthly production figures, which would have allowed for stronger analysis of the impact of El Niño and  La Niña during key crop cycle events, notably pod development. While the ICCO study focused on the  impact of El Niño and La Niña directly, another study conducted in Indonesia found that El Niñoinduced  droughts reduce cocoa yield by 62% (Keil et al., 2008).     ShadeandSoil In general, most researchers agree that shade decreases crop yield but that it may be beneficial in sub optimal conditions because it "reduces photosynthesis, transpiration, metabolism and growth and  therefore, the demand on soil nutrients and so enables a crop to be obtained on soils of lower fertility"  41   

(Purseglove, 1968). Vaast et al. (2006) found that coffee grown in suboptimal conditions in Costa Rica  over a 3year period yielded 16% less under full sun than dense shade and 49% less under full sun than  light shade; however, in optimal conditions, artificial shade reduced coffee yield by 18% compared to  full sun. Pinard et al. (2014) also found that coffee yields increased by 55% under the shade of non leguminous trees (especially P. americana and F. thonningii), which provided low light interception at  the canopy level and enriched the soil with potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Lin (2009) found that  60­80% shade cover reduced soil evaporation on coffee plots by 41% compared to coffee grown under  lowshade conditions (1030% cover). Even with 3065% cover, Lin (2009) observed that soil moisture  was maintained during the dry season, which could possibly be explained by the presence of trees that  draw water from higher to lower layers of the soil column (Burgess et al., 1998).    The agroforestry models of John Beer (1987, Beer et al. 1998) have been some of the most 

influential as applied to the coffee and cocoa sectors. Beer details the advantages and disadvantages of  using shade for coffee and cocoa cultivation; specifically, shade can help to improve climactic and site  conditions by reducing air and soil temperature extremes, reducing wind speeds, buffering humidity and  soil moisture, and improving or maintaining soil fertility (Beer et al. 1998). The reduced quality and  quantity of light available to the crop tree allows for an avoidance of overbearing in coffee and  excessive vegetative growth for cocoa and therefore could be beneficial for farmers that do not have  access to fertilizers (Beer, 1987); however, on the other hand, shade may limit yield potential due to  reduced sunlight, cause increase competition for water, and increase the occurrence of pests and  disease in some areas (Beer et al. 1998).  Beer concluded that shade trees could help to protect against  adverse weather conditions, notably by buffering temperature fluctuations of up to 5°C and producing  up to 14 Mg ha­1 yr­1 of litterfall and pruning residues, containing up to 340 kg N ha­1 yr­1 (Beer et al.  1998). Shade was found to increase the incidence of some pests and diseases, such as Phytophthora 

42   

palmivora and Mycena citricolor and decrease others, such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and  Cercospora coffeicola.    Several longterm studies in Ghana (Ahenkorah et al., 1974; Dawoe et al., 2014; Tondoh et al., 

2015; and Vanhove et al., 2016) found that nonshaded cocoa plantations experienced faster soil  degradation than their shaded counterparts and therefore required more fertilizer. Ahenkorah et al.  (1974) found that nonshaded cocoa trees that were continuously cropped yielded three times more  cocoa than shaded cocoa trees over the 17 year study period. However, this intensive cropping was  found to only be useful for 10 years, after which, nitrogen and organic soil carbon decline and only begin  to recover after 1520 years (Tondoh et al., 2015 and Dawoe et al., 2014).  Vanhove et al. notes that  Ahenkorah et al.'s study ended around the time when yields would begin to decline, and therefore used  a 22year old cocoa plot needing rehabilitation as their area under study. Yield outcomes in Vanhove et  al.'s study were variable, depending on the clone of cocoa planted, which they attribute to physiological  differences; while one clone was found to have a 46% higher yield in an agroforestry system, another  was 20% lower under shade (2016). One of the main takeaways from this study was therefore that  varieties of cocoa able to adapt to local conditions and better resist pests and disease may be the best  way to rehabilitate old plantations.     One of the most comprehensive coffee studies done of late has come from van Oijen et al. 

(2010a, 2010b), who conducted a literature review of coffee agroforestry systems in Central America to  identify quantitative data in order to create a processbased agroforestry model. They found that most  of the models in the literature either contained qualitative data or quantitative data on coffee trees,  shade trees, and soil that are only applicable to specific sites (van Oijen et al. 2010a). Despite finding  significant gaps in the availability of data, they were able to create a model that can capture the  underlying mechanisms and processes of coffee growth more generally. After running simulations that 

43   

looked at the system without shade trees, with one environmental factor changed or shade tree species  substituted, and with different weather conditions, the authors found that coffee yields tended to  decrease with tree density, regardless of whether or not the trees were nitrogen fixers.  

6.3BioeconomicModels
Bioeconomic models, as the name suggests, include both biophysical and economic data, making them  ideal for multidisciplinary study. In his review of this integrated model type, Douglas R. Brown (2000)  found that there is a spectrum of bioeconomic models, ranging from biological process models than  include an element of economic analysis to economic optimization models that include biophysical  components, with integrated models that capture the interaction between economic and biophysical  processes in the middle. Typically, bioeconomic models have been used to determine the economic  outcome of policies and, in the realm of agriculture, how certain economic factors will affect farm  income. For example, Diao and Sarpong (2007) used a bioeconomic model to assess the effects of land  degradation in Ghana on agricultural gross domestic product. However, some studies have explicitly  used bioeconomic models to assess the impacts of environmental factors on commodities prices ­ e.g.  the previously cited ICCO study on the impacts of El Niño and La Niña weather events found that the  2.43% decrease in world cocoa supply resulted in a price increase of 1.66% (ICCO, 2010). This type of  interdisciplinary model more closely resembles the models of commodity market participants than any  of the aforementioned model types and therefore is of interest to this study.     Brunner (2002) created a model to determine the impact of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 

weather events on the prices of the 30 nonoil commodities included in the International Monetary  Fund's commodity price index. Using sea surface temperatures and sealevel air pressure anomalies in  the Pacific Ocean as ENSO variables, and average CPI inflation, average GDP growth, and real commodity  price inflation as economic variables, Brunner found that a one standard deviation in a positive ENSO  event raises real commodity prices by 3.54% and that 20% of commodity price inflation movements  44   

between 1964 and 2000. However, as coffee and cocoa only account for approximately 7% of the index,  the results for these two commodities were not as strong, nor were they found to be statistically  significant at the 5% level; the model showed that a one standard deviation in positive ENSO event  would decrease coffee milds prices by 4.7% and increase Robustas and cocoa prices by 0.9% and 2.4%,  respectively (Brunner, 2002).  In 1995, Ruf created a bioeconomic model to correct what he saw as shortcomings in the  speculative models, namely that they use too short of a time horizon and that they cannot account for  shifts in production centres. Ruf (1995) developed a list of 15 basic cocoa "laws" of supply:  forest rent;  the interaction with forest rent and other natural resources; monoculture; labour rent; tree capital;  monetary capital; accumulators and family support; institutional factors; information, plant material,  and preconditions for a boom; farming household life cycles; price; land holding rent; sales cycles; dual  nature of smallholdings and estates; and state interventions. The model aims to understand the linkage  between cocoa cycles, price, cost, and changes in cocoa supply centres (Ruf, 2005). Unique to Ruf's  model is his notion of "forest rent", which is defined as the difference in cost between one tonne of  cocoa produced on a plantation created after forest clearance and tonne of cocoa produced by  replanting on fallow land or after the felling of the first plantation (Ruf, 2005). The idea behind this  concept is that the forest provides many ecological benefits, such as soil fertility; protection against  erosion, pests, disease, and wind; and moisture retention. Without considering these factors in pricing  models, Ruf estimates that the hidden and externalized costs of deforestation therefore account for 80 100% of the cost to establish a plantation (Ruf, 2005). In the longterm, farmers that are best equipped  to capitalize on this "forest rent" are those with the technical knowhow to exploit it for longterm gain.    Fleming and Milne (2003) developed bioeconomic models to help policymakers set priorities 

for the cocoa industry in Papua New Guinea. The authors developed two models, one for smallholders 

45   

and one for estates, both of which included estimates of economic surplus; tree or palm area; land  suitability; inputoutput relations; breakeven values; export volumes and values; export price  formation; and domestic price formation (Fleming and Milne, 2003). The models assessed various price  policies to determine their effectiveness in maximizing economic surplus, including: shortterm output  price support; price stabilization; exchange rate manipulation; countercyclical planting subsidies;  subsidies on purchased fertilizer inputs; and policies influencing the opportunity cost of rural labour  (Fleming and Milne, 2003). Of these different policy options, the authors found that fertilizer subsidies  (a 10% reduction in the price of fertilizer) had the greatest impact on yield, increasing yields by 10% and  economic surplus by 7% on smallholder farms and 9% on estates (Fleming and Milne, 2003). Quoting  Allen et al. (1995), Fleming and Milne (2003) caution that the effectiveness of fertilizer decreases over  time and agricultural intensification can lead to land degradation.    Gay et al. (2006) developed a multiple regression model with both economic and climatic 

determinants of coffee production in Veracruz, Mexico to understand how coffee yields may be affected  by climate change. The climatic variables assessed were seasonal rainfall, seasonal temperature, and the  variance from these mean seasonal values (i.e. extreme weather events), while the economic variables  assessed were: real minimum wage in the state of Veracruz, coffee prices in Veracruz, international  coffee prices, Veracruz state population, coffee stocks in Mexico, coffee stocks in the United States, and  a producer price index (Gay et al. 2006). Using projections of climate change for the year 2020, which  include a 41.2% decrease in average spring rainfall and 8.6% increase in average winter temperature  from a 1990 baseline, the authors estimate a 24.5% decrease in coffee production in the state of  Veracruz (Gay et al. 2006). This decrease is even more pronounced in the scenarios in which the state  government decides to raise minimum wage rates, as labour costs represent the highest input cost for  coffee farmers in this region (Gay et al. 2006).

While the aforementioned bioeconomic models vary considerably in their outcomes, they are 

worth highlighting in that they are similar in structure to the models used by the coffee and cocoa  market participants, who consider both economic and environmental variables in the crop yield and  futures price forecasts.  

6.4Modelsusedbymarketparticipants
In light of the absence of publicallyavailable data about the pricebuilding models used by futures  markets participants, it was necessary to speak directly to them to understand the factors they include  in their models. To collect data about factors considered in the crop forecasting models used by market  participants, interviews were conducted by phone with 15 key players in the coffee and cocoa markets,  representing both speculators and hedgers. Speculators were selected based on their expertise in a  given commodity, identified through media searches, and commercial traders were selected based on  their prominence in the coffee and cocoa markets. While the initial understanding was that all market  participants selected for interviews used these crop forecasting techniques as part of their futures price  forecasting models, some interviewees indicated that they did not model futures prices and only had  crop supply and demand forecasts. Those that did model futures prices almost unanimously indicated  that demand for coffee and cocoa was fairly stable (25% annual growth), therefore crop supply (24  times more variable) accounted for the bulk of futures price movements (anywhere between 20100%).  These proprietary models are largely used by physical traders to determine their positions in the market  and for supply planning, while the brokers/research houses use this information to guide others in  taking a position on the market. Based on the nature of the futures markets, the time horizon of these  models are 6 months ­ 2 years. However, research revealed one industry organization interviewed also  has a longerterm model which is qualitative in nature, in addition to its shortterm forecast.  

47   

The means by which market participants forecast crop supply is by estimating the amount of a  commodity stored from previous seasons and the yield from the current season. Stocks are particularly  important to the coffee market, as coffee stores quite well in the regions in which it is grown, while  cocoa is not stored for as long, given its susceptibility to mould and bacteria in hot, humid production  areas. Of particular interest to this study, however, is that in forecasting coffee and cocoa output for a  particular season, interviewees rely on historic weather data to determine the magnitude of a particular  environmental factor or event on crop output, based on the yield effect in the past. One interviewee  succinctly described the challenge of using this approach in the context of 2015 being the driest winter  in West Africa in recent history: "When you look at a weather event that only happens once every 60  years because you've never seen these circumstances, you can't really get good data." Another noted  that greater variation in weather patterns yeartoyear and more frequent weather events have a  significant impact on other environmental factors, which are not adequately captured in the models.  Nonetheless, the standard approach involves making assumptions on what is considered to be "normal"  weather and modelling expected deviations from the norm. As a result of this approach, market  participants do not use attribution factors or coefficients to explain the effect of individual  environmental variables on crop yield but rather go by "gut feel" or "experience" to estimate the  magnitude of the impact.  Like the econometric models reviewed in the literature, market participants consider price to be  a determinant in forecasting crop supply. Price determines how much stored coffee and cocoa will be  traded and will also influence producers' decision to plant new trees. Interviewees expressed difficulty  in estimating stocks and noted that they were often caught offguard by how much coffee and cocoa  flooded the markets when prices were high. Producers also plant new trees when prices are high, even  though the trees will not begin to produce for several years, when the additional crop supply usually has  a deflationary effect on prices. One of the most interesting findings to come out of the interviews was  48   

the near unanimous agreement that the biggest challenge posed to the longterm viability of the coffee  and cocoa markets was that prices are not high enough to keep farmers in the market or attract new  farmers. This was seen as particularly problematic for the cocoa industry, as cocoa trees and farmers are  aging and productivity is low as a result of producers not being able to afford fertilizers. On a related  note, other interviewees also mentioned the fact that farmers lack access to capital and startup costs  for coffee and cocoa are highly capitalintensive; therefore, it is possible that farmers will begin to use  their land for other, more lucrative crops. 

Coffee 
By far the most common factors included in the coffee forecasting models were temperature and  volume of rainfall (both included in 73% of the models), with timing of rainfall and farmers' use of inputs  as close seconds (both included in 64% of the models). Coffee market participants indicated that this  weather data was readily available from the largest producing countries, Brazil and Vietnam, and  therefore daily temperatures and rainfall were included in the coffee forecasting models; data  availability for other countries meant that they could only track temperature and rainfall on a weekly or  monthly basis. The timing of the rainfall was considered particularly important during key points of the  crop cycle, namely flowering and the dry period. Participants indicated that not enough rain during the  flowering period and too much rain during the dry period could result in lower crop yields. El Niño and  La Niña weather events were also considered relevant by 36% of interviewees in predicting the amount  of rain during a given period; as one interviewee explained: "Sometimes it [El Niño] brings extra rain at  the right time, sometimes at the wrong time". One interview participant explained that stronger El Niño  is associated with more rainfall in Brazil and below average rainfall in Vietnam. The inclusion of this data  reflects the market participants' attitudes of the importance of data coming from Brazil and Vietnam  versus the other coffeeproducing countries (27% of interviewees specifically identified weather events 

49   

in Brazil ­ e.g. droughts, frosts ­ as a factor that affects coffee supply). Accordingly, 36% of interview  participants considered the biennial coffee production cycle in Brazil to be relevant in forecasting coffee  yield, vs. the 18% of interviewees that indicated the previous year's production was relevant to  forecasting the current year's yield. One interviewee elaborated on the fact that the yield differences  between years can be attributed to the fact that coffee farmers do not prune all of their coffee trees at  once; although this is starting to change in Brazil, where the yield differences between years are  becoming less pronounced.  Coffee market participants interviewed for this study indicated that more important than  forecasting the NY "C" Coffee Price was the ability to forecast the differential between the NY "C" Coffee  Price and the prices for Brazilian Milds, Colombian Milds, Other Milds, and Robustas. In this regard, it is  worth noting that 27% of interview participants included shade in their models for Central American  production, as they indicated that shade could help in mitigating hotter than normal temperatures and  handling rust outbreaks. 45% of interviewees indicated that pests and disease could negatively affect  coffee production and many linked the outbreak of certain diseases to weather patterns. The same  number of interview participants indicated that farm maintenance was important and several  participants highlighted the disparity in yields between the different systems used in the major coffee growing countries: large estate plantations in Brazil and Vietnam vs. smallholder farms in Central  America. In addition to pruning practices previously mentioned, part of the difference in the farm  maintenance highlighted by the interviewees was the use of inputs; access to pesticides and fertilizers  was largely seen as a function of coffee price, with pricesensitive smallholders having less access to  inputs than the larger producers.  Unlike cocoa market participants, few coffee market participants cited crop cycle events as  being relevant to yield outputs (18% mentioned node growth and cherry count, 27% mentioned 

50   

flowering) and even fewer interviewees (9%) indicated that altitude, soil moisture, or humidity were  relevant factors in their models.   FIGURE 9: SUMMARY OF COFFEE MARKET PARTICIPANT RESPONSES  Rainfall  volume Temperature Farmers' use of inputs Rainfall  timing Pests and disease El Niño/La Niña Biennial production cycle in Brazil Flowering Shade Weather events in Brazil/Vietnam Cherry count Node growth Humidity Soil moisture Altitude

Cocoa 
Cocoa market participants clearly indicated that pod count and volume of rainfall were the key  determinants in forecasting cocoa supply (included in 78% of the models), while 56% of interviewees  also considered the timing of rainfall and the Harmattan [a dry wind that passes over West Africa] to be  key factors. Shade was considered to be the next most important factor (included in 44% of models), 

51   

while temperature, soil moisture, El Niño/La Niña weather events, and farm maintenance were included  in onethird of the models.   In contrast to the major coffeeproducing countries, interview participants indicated that  temperature and rainfall data are extremely difficult to access in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, and therefore  there appeared to be an information imbalance between market players. Specifically, cocoa market  participants with substantial operations on the ground, mostly the physical traders, had their own  meteorological stations in the major cocoagrowing regions. This afforded them access to the most  accurate weather rainfall data, while other market participants were reliant on thirdparty weather data,  which was generally from a meteorological station close to a major airport, far away from the cocoa growing regions. Those with their own weather stations were able to monitor temperature and rainfall  on a daily basis, while most other interviewees mentioned that they looked at a 10day weather cycle.  One interviewee explained that, compared to coffee, temperature is less important than rainfall in  predicting cocoa yield, given that temperatures are relatively stable in the major cocoaproducing  countries.  In the absence of reliable data on the area of land under production, cocoa market participants  relied heavily on teams on the ground to conduct pod counts to estimate yield. Interviewees explained  that pod counts were done by having local teams visit the same sample group of trees to compare the  number of pods to previous seasons. Using the crop output from previous seasons allows them to  forecast crop yield for the current season, based on the number of pods on the trees. Historical data  also assists participants in estimating the survival rate of pods during certain weather events. One  interviewee explained that her organization has a "flowering threshold" which gives a high probability of  survival to pods that grow to over 3 inches.  Interviewees noted that the amount of rainfall during  flowering is crucial in determining the flowering of the buds on the trees and drier conditions during this 

52   

period generally result in lower yields. However, too much rainfall can create humid conditions that  encourage the development of fungus and black pod disease, which ultimately lower crop yield.  Shade cover, farm maintenance, and input use (each cited by 33% of interviewees) appeared to  be treated slightly differently by interview participants. Shade cover was not seen to be particularly  relevant by interview participants and even those that considered it only did so in a qualitative fashion.  One interviewee explained that the absence of shade cover affects soil productivity after about 10 years,  which is concerning given that less than 50% of cocoa farmers use fertilizer (due to price constraints)  and even fewer are trained on how to fertilize properly so they cannot address soil fertility. The lack of  input use in fighting disease was cited by several interviewees as the reason for which yields were so  low.   The weather events that cocoa participants signaled were relevant to cocoa yields were the  Harmattan (56%) and El Niño/La Niña (33%). One interviewee explained that his model shows the  Harmattan and El Niño usually having a negative effect on cocoa yields, while La Niña is associated with  higher than normal yields. Other interviewees indicated that too strong of a Harmattan results in crop  losses. Two participants cited the ICCO's finding that global cocoa production is 2.4% lower during El  Niño years, while La Niña does not have any significant impact on production.                53   

FIGURE 10: SUMMARY OF COCOA MARKET PARTICIPANT RESPONSES 

 

Potential  Limitations  to  the  Interviews 
Given that interview participants were asked to elaborate on the factors that they considered most  relevant to forecasting coffee yields, and that the market participants are competitors, it is possible that  for their own reasons they chose to not provide the researcher with an exhaustive list of every single  factor that they include in their models. In analyzing the results of the interviews, it became clear that it  was possible that some interviewees considered the same factors but used more generic language to  describe them (e.g. "weather events" as opposed to "El Niño/La Niña") and therefore were not included  in the percentages cited above. Knowing in advance that the focus of this study was on environmental  factors considered in commodity supply forecasting, it is possible that some participants did not detail  the social and economic factors that they consider to be relevant, even when prompted to do so. This  appeared to be the case in instances where coffee market participants appeared to assume that acreage  and currency factors would naturally be considered in the models, given their relevance to yield and  futures prices, respectively (total cocoa acreage is not known and this was explicitly mentioned by all  cocoa market participants).  54   

7. SynthesisandDiscussion
In both the market participants' models and the models found through literature review, timing of  rainfall appears to overwhelmingly be the most important variable used in predicting coffee and cocoa  yields. Both coffee and cocoa market participants stressed that rainfall during the flowering period was  most essential, while coffee market participants also highlighted the importance of the amount of rain  during the dry period. Similarly, the coffee literature emphasized the importance of the number of days  of rainfall during the flowering period in ensuring even fruit ripening (Craparo et al., 2015 and DaMatta  et al., 2008). The cocoa literature quantified the yield impact of rainfall more explicitly:  Zuidema et al.  (2005) found that annual radiation and rainfall during the two driest months of the crop cycle accounted  for 70% of the variation in bean yield and Alvim (1988) found a positive correlation between cocoa yield  and rainfall up to 6 months before the harvest period. This is important to consider in the context of  CIAT's 2011 forecast that climate change will result in less monthly and yearly rainfall and decrease the  number of dry months from 4 to 3 in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire by 2050. Cocoa market participants also  noted that special attention was paid to the amount of rainfall during pod development; the literature  cited a 60% decrease in pod production after multiweek flooding (Monteiro, 1962, as referenced in  Almeida and Valle, 2008) and a reduction in yield when drought conditions are present during pod  production (Orchard and Saltos, 1988; Hutcheon, 1977; Sale, 1970; and Khan et al., 1988, as referenced  in Almeida and Valle, 2008). Likewise, coffee market participants and the literature indicated that the  amount of rainfall during the development of the coffee fruit was strongly correlated to yield (Dos  Santos and Camargo, 2006); van Oijen et al. found that doubling the amount of rainfall reduces yield  (2010b).  While coffee market participants spoke about the impact of El Niño/La Niña events in the  context of changes to the amount of rainfall, with only one exception, they did not note a clear link to 

55   

the yield outputs. This response differs from cocoa market interviewees, who largely responded in line  with the prevailing study on the impact of El Niño and La Niña on crop yield, conducted by the ICCO.   Temperature was also one of the most important indicators for coffee in both the literature and  in the models of the coffee market participants. While the market participants indicated that they  monitored temperature on a daily basis in the major coffeeproducing countries, the literature  suggested that slight changes in temperature do not have a significant yield impact. However,  temperatures that fall within the extreme cold or extreme hot range are likely to reduce yields and  therefore producer regions whose average temperatures are on the border of "normal" should be  monitored in case they fall outside of this average range (e.g. the case of Tanzania in Craparo et al.'s  study). Market participants were not particularly concerned about changes to climate suitability, as it  generally fell beyond the time horizon of their futures forecasting models, though climate suitability  models featured prominently in the literature. While the climate suitability models predicted changes  that would be observed by 2050, based on the IPCC AR4 model, it is worth noting that some regions may  experience climate change sooner than others. Additionally, the magnitude of the change will depend  on which cultivars are being grown; for example, Robusta coffee beans are more resilient than Arabica  beans in warmer climates. Whether these temperature changes actually result in farmers abandoning  their farms or moving to new regions will largely depend on economic factors, such as farmers' access to  credit and nonfarm income.  The cocoa literature gave less weight to the importance of pod counts than the market  participants, who considered it to be the main yield determinant besides rainfall. This may be explained  by different data collection techniques used by interviewees and academics, which were generally more  reliant on desktop models rather than field visits, thus making it difficult for academics to conduct pod  counts on an ongoing basis. In turn, the market participants emphasized the importance of the 

56   

Harmattan wind in affecting the survivability of the cherelles ­ an environmental factor that is entirely  absent from the literature, save for a brief mention when explaining the climate in which cocoa is  grown. Instead, the literature put a stronger emphasis on the ecophysiological reasons for pod count  variations ­ i.e. how changes in rainfall, weather events affect pod growth ­ than the market  participants.   In contrast, the academic literature assigned more weight to the importance of shade and soil  quality in predicting yield than the market participants. This is likely a function of the difference in time  horizons between the models ­ the academic studies tending to be longitudinal studies ­ and the  difficulty in applying a localized variable, such as soil quality or shade, to the forecast of global coffee or  cocoa supply. As one interviewee noted: "I don't know that you can meaningfully account for shade as  an aggregate ­ you don't need to dig down that far." Perhaps it is for this reason that the market  participants, notably in coffee, considered shade as an effective risk management tool in Central  America, which is consistent with the literature that observed shade is useful in protecting against  extreme weather and pests and disease (Purseglove, 1968; Beer et al. 1998; Vaast et al., 2006).  Historically, the literature on the effects of shade on coffee and cocoa have found that highlyshaded  plots produce lower yields (Purseglove, 1968; Ahenkorah et al., 1974; Beer et al. 1998; Vaast et al.,  2006) but recent literature (Vanhove et al., 2016) has suggested that this is only true up until a certain  point ­ approximately 22 years ­ after which the lack of shade causes land degradation. This speaks to  what Ruf (2005) calls "forest rent" which is the extra added ecological benefits of forested land, such as  soil fertility and moisture retention. Given the literature's focus on declining soil quality, it is notable  that this variable is largely not accounted for in the market participant models, especially since cocoa is  often grown on deforested land, nor is tree or plot age a factor in most participants' models (11% of  cocoa market participants indicated that they considered tree age, while 36% of coffee market  participants consider the age of the farm). It could be argued that the coffee market participants  57   

consider fertilizer use to be a proxy for poor soil quality; however, this is not universally the case, as  many farmers operating in soilpoor environments are not using fertilizers due to cost constraints.  Another difference between the literature and market participants' models that can be  attributed to the difference in time horizon is the potential change in climate suitability in the major  coffee and cocoaproducing regions. While the literature raised this as a serious potential threat,  market participants did not express concern, even when directly probed on this issue. To date, they have  not observed major changes in the production centres of these crops. However, as this risk materializes,  farmers (and those who buy from them) will have to internalize the high capital output costs require to  start new farms in new environments.  On a related note, the approach of coffee market participants appears to be largely in line with  the econometrics literature in how they treat price in their models. Notably, they have observed that  the current price of coffee provides a signal to farmers about the future prices that they can expect to  receive and, based on this information, the farmer chooses whether or not to plant more coffee. The  market participants noted that the lag in price can result in an oversupply of coffee in the 35 years after  planting, which causes the market price to drop and generally incentivizes farmers to store their coffee  until the price climbs higher. Cocoa market participants, on the other hand, did not mention price being  a contributing factor to forecasting yield. 

8. Conclusions
Prior to undertaking the research, , the author was under the impression that coffee and cocoa market  participants predicted crop output by assigning attribution factors to different variables in the model.  However, upon completion of the interviews, it became apparent that the importance of one factor over  another is constantly changing and therefore market participants cannot forecast yield by assigning  attribution factors. Instead, the organizations surveyed tend to estimate crop output "by feel" based on  58   

the effect of similar conditions on crop yield, as historically witnessed. Using this approach, it is possible  that, in the medium to longterm, they will experience increased difficulty in estimating crop yield as  climate change causes extreme weather events and an increase in frequency of some not previously  seen. There may also be changes in multiple environmental factors simultaneously, such as changing  rainfall distribution patterns and higher temperatures.   The interview participants appeared to be extremely confident in their models' ability to predict  yield and/or futures prices, yet only 40% indicated that they conducted any sort of backtesting to verify  if their assumptions were correct. Of those that did, only 2 could provide statistics on the outcome of  their models; one organization cited a 2% gap in production figures, while another interviewee reported  an R2 of 8085% for his cocoa model and 6075% for his coffee model. One participant said that the  market was his feedback mechanism. It follows that very few participants (33%) have actually changed  the inputs to their models over time and only one participant indicated conducting sensitivity analyses  of model inputs to determine their relevance. Of those that did not review model inputs on a systematic  basis, those that were amenable to making changes to their models did so on an "as needed" basis  when it became apparent that they were missing key market fundamentals in their analysis. For  example, upon realizing the role of hedge funds as speculators on the cocoa market, one interviewee  began incorporating this factor into his model and it now accounts for 10% of his futures price forecast  (the other weights and factors being: 10% currency, and 40% supply and 40% demand).   In the medium to longterm, it may be difficult to pinpoint one new variable that needs to be  added as climatic changes tend to alter the interaction between variables. OvalleRivera et al. (2015),  writing about the shift of coffee production to higher elevations as warmer temperatures render current  coffeegrowing areas unsuitable for production, eloquently states: "An important proviso is that the  areas at higher elevation are available for conversion to coffee farms, are accessible, have suitable soil 

59   

conditions, and whose current or future inhabitants are willing to grow Arabica coffee rather than other  crops. Very often, these conditions may not all come together, with the consequence that Arabica  coffee production may locally decline."   Additionally, the current market mechanisms ­ i.e. the length of the futures contracts ­ reward  shortterm thinking and therefore it may be difficult to persuade market participants to consider long term variables, unless they are absolutely proven to have an effect on shortterm yields. However, there  is increasing recognition of the fact that the shortterm liquidity provided by futures is not sufficient to  address the industry's longterm challenges, as evidenced by industrywide initiatives such as Cocoa  Action, which seeks to address two of the cocoa industry's biggest problems related to low farmer  income: lack of fertilizer usage and child labour. The disconnect between the futures market and  physical coffee market has led some coffee buyers to forego the futures market altogether in lieu of  direct trade relationships with farmers in order to ensure a certain quality standard (Warnau, 2015).  Small tweaks to futures pricing models may allow market participants to internalize some of these risks,  which they are often already paying heavily for elsewhere (e.g. farmer climate adaptation strategies).  Making matters more difficult is the fact that most participants were less concerned about the  drivers of environmental or social change ­ i.e. why a certain phenomenon was taking place ­ as  opposed to capturing the shortterm effects of these changes in their models ­ i.e. the occurrence of  particular weather events. Not capturing the reason behind the changes may result in the failure to  address a systematic problem in the market and price this risk into the model. For example, as  previously noted, interview participants identified low coffee and cocoa prices as being the reason that  many farmers are deciding to cease operations but this producer flight is not explicitly captured in  production forecasts. 

60   

Additionally, interviewees acknowledged the importance of certain environmental factors such  as soil quality but expressed difficulty in quantitatively including them in their models or did not feel  that they would have a pronounced shortterm impact on crop output. Again, this results in certain risks  not being priced into the model. For some of the longterm environmental challenges that do not have  an immediate shortterm yield impacts but could drastically change the industry over the longterm, the  failure to price in risk is concerning. One such example that was raised in the academic literature and  not mentioned by any of the market participants is land suitability for coffee and cocoa production.  While changes in land suitability would happen over a longterm period, the fact that it is being ignored  by the market because it does not neatly fit into a 624 month futures price model means that it will not  be captured at all over a 1020year period, when the risk will start to materialize. 

8.1Recommendations
Based on the foregoing analysis, the following recommendations are made:   Recommendation #1: Market participants could use the attribution factors mentioned in the  literature, which have taken into account variances in other environmental factors, to understand the  impact on yield. For example, attributing 70% of cocoa yield output to the 2 driest months of the year  could allow for market models to capture the yield impact of weather patterns not previously  observed.  Recommendation #2: When estimating yields during or immediately following climatic events (e.g.  strong Harmattan winds, droughts, extreme temperature swings), market participants can adjust the  expected yield impact for production areas that are shaded. Given that the literature indicates shade  can buffer temperature fluctuations of up to 5°C and retain soil moisture during dry periods, it is likely  that shaded areas will not suffer the same yield reductions as unshaded areas and therefore this  should be accounted for in the models. 

61   

Recommendation #3: Market participants could use a different model to estimate yield for production  areas that are more than 10 years old and exposed to sunlight (i.e. not shaded), which is  approximately the length of time when soils are depleted and the benefits of the plant being exposed  to direct sunlight decrease. Adjustments could be made accordingly where there is evidence of pruning  and fertilizer usage.  Recommendation #4: Market participants could use Bateman's model (1965) of assigning different  price elasticities to farmers based on the soil quality, rainfall, and humidity in the areas in which they  are operating. Those operating in more challenging environments are more price elastic and therefore  will need to be enticed by higher prices in order to continue farming and adapt to changing conditions. 

8.2Opportunitiesforfuturestudy
It is apparent from the interviews that there is serious information asymmetry in the market, with  companies operating on the ground ­ mostly the physical traders ­ having access to significantly more  data than those conducting desktop research or speculating on the market. One interviewee even  quantified the number of entities that have "put any effort into forecasting" following the closure of the  research departments of the major cocoa buyers: 1012 entities for cocoa and 6 entities for coffee.  Numerous interviewees cited the lack of market research being conducted for coffee and cocoa as cause  for concern, with one participant singling out the failure of the ICE to fulfill its role as an exchange in  facilitating market transparency by not supporting the market through research or development. This is  somewhat ironic, given that the New York Coffee Exchange was created in 1882 to decrease the  information imbalance between commercial and noncommercial traders, following a market collapse in  1880 caused by excess speculation (Topik, 2004). Understanding that some market players are privy to  more information than others, it may be worth revisiting the assumption that futures markets are  efficient markets, i.e. prices fully reflect all available information, as per Fama's efficient market  hypothesis (Fama, 1970). While Nardella (2007) tested the efficient market hypothesis for the cocoa  62   

futures market and found that it was efficient, he only considered the release of public information to  the market. While this satisfies Fama's "semistrong" test for market efficiency ­ i.e. the incorporation of  all public information into pricing ­ as this study demonstrates, coffee and cocoa market players that  have the ability to collect data on the ground may benefit from having access to nonpublic information  that would allow them to more accurately predict futures prices. Therefore, using Fama's "strong form"  test, i.e. in which some groups have privileged access to some market information, futures markets may  not be seen as efficient.  The increased role of speculators is perceived to have caused increased disruption on the coffee  and cocoa markets, but particularly for cocoa, a market 25% controlled by hedge funds. As these  speculators do not know very much about coffee or cocoa and rely on other sources for data (largely  traders and news sources), they cause the markets to run on speculation. Coupled with the reduction of  other soft commodity market participants, as one interviewee noted, this causes a real liquidity issue in  a multiyear market where futures only provide liquidity for one year. While it is beyond the scope of  this thesis to measure the impact of lessinformed speculators on futures price movements, this topic  has been studied at least to some extent by UNCTAD (Maurice and Davis, 2012), ICCO (Nardella, 2007),  and several academics (Holt and Irwin, 2000; Irwin and Yoshimaru, 1999; Streeter and Tomek, 1992) and  is deserving of further investigation.  Within the scientific literature, it would be useful to explore in greater depth the relative  importance of temperature changes versus rising atmospheric carbon on coffee yields. While DaMatta  and Ramalho (2006) have long maintained that coffee plants may be able to adapt to gradual  temperature changes over time, and even benefit from higher atmospheric carbon, Craparo et al.'s  study (2015) challenges this thinking, by attributing yield declines to rising minimum temperatures. 

63   

Replicating Craparo et al.'s methodology would serve to test if their conclusions are observed in other  geographies, or if rising carbon may offset the yield declines caused by temperature changes. 

8.3ContributiontotheAcademicLiterature
This thesis fills a gap in the academic literature on pricebuilding models in the coffee and cocoa futures  markets. To the author's knowledge, this study is also the first to explore the possibility of pricing in  longterm environmental risk factors into commodities futures forecasting models. As mentioned in the  introduction section, the financial industry as a whole is still grappling with how to capture longterm  risks, especially environmental and social risks, in shortterm models. The United Nations Principles for  Responsible Investment (UNPRI) has issued multiple guidance documents for institutional investors on  how to implement longterm strategies for different asset classes at the same time, leading institutions,  such as CPPIB and McKinsey, are pushing for the industry to adopt a more longterm approach.  However, by their very nature, futures markets will never be longterm and therefore need to be able to  capture longterm risk in shortterm models to provide incentive for farmers to continue to produce.  Investors have made progress in doing so for some asset classes, notably equities, for example by  applying a lower discount rate to discount cash flow models to companies that have strong  environmental and social risk management systems in place.   The UNPRI's guidance document on best practice in responsible investment in commodities  recommends investing in physical commodities that are certified to recognized environmental and social  standards, suggesting that these producers are better managing environmental and social risks (UNPRI,  2011). Although for commodity derivatives, such as futures, the guidance centers around the  institutional investors' role in ensuring that its position in a market does not disrupt its price discovery  function and pushing for greater transparency amount key market actors, such as commodity futures  exchanges and investment managers (UNPRI, 2011). The guidance does not address what would  constitute best practice for these key market actors, beyond providing greater transparency. In light of  64   

the dearth of information surrounding the price building models in futures markets identified by the  UNPRI, by providing an overview of the forecasting models used by key market players in the coffee and  cocoa markets, this thesis aims to contribute to a gap in the literature.

AppendixA:InterviewQuestionnaire
      Which factors do you include in your coffee/cocoa supply function?  Do you consider any environmental factors? If so, which ones?  Do you consider any social factors? If so, which ones?  What weight is given to these environmental/social factors relative to other factors that are  major determinants in supply?    How often is your model updated?  From where do you collect the environmental/social data that flows into the model?  o Is there other data that you would include in your model but cannot include due to lack  of data availability?   How much weight is given to the supply function in your model of price discovery  (supply/demand)?   Do you have a feedback loop in your model to compare your forecasts to the spot prices of  coffee and cocoa? If so, how often were the price forecasts accurate (say, within 10%)?   What do you perceive to be the greatest challenge for coffee/cocoa production in the next 20  years?
