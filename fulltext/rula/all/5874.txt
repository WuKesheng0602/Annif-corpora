EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Emerging technologies, such as arti cial intelligence and advanced robotics, have the potential to fundamentally change our work and daily lives. In recent years, the understanding of how these technological trends will impact employment has been at the forefront of many recent public debates. Each week there seem to be more and more articles being released about how "robots are taking our jobs." For the most part, this rich discussion has been driven by the work of many prominent academics and researchers. Unsurprisingly, there are many competing viewpoints. Some argue that disruptive technology will be the driving force behind massive unemployment. Others posit that any potential job loss will likely be o set by productivity increases and employment growth. Despite the extensive literature, this discussion is largely taking place without the use of Canadian data. Although, we know that Canadians are not immune from the e ects of automation, and that technological trends will likely have enormous implications for many Canadian industries. But the gap in Canadian-speci c knowledge o en means that we lack the tools to understand the impact of automation within our own borders. This limits our ability to begin to plan for potential disruption. We therefore felt that it would be useful to apply the ndings from the existing literature to the Canadian workforce. To do so, we used methodologies both from both Oxford professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne and from management consulting rm McKinsey & Company, which have been employed in other jurisdictions, and applied them both to Canadian data for the rst time.

It is our goal to help Canadians be er understand the e ects that automation can have on our labour force. Overall we found that nearly 42 percent of the Canadian labour force is at a high risk of being a ected by automation in the next decade or two. Individuals in these occupations earn less and are less educated than the rest of the Canadian labour force. While the literature suggests that these occupations may not necessarily be lost, we also discovered that major job restructuring will likely occur as a result of new technology. Using a di erent methodology, we found that nearly 42 percent of the tasks that Canadians are currently paid to do can be automated using existing technology. But the data does not paint an entirely negative picture. Using the Canadian Occupation Projection System (COPS), we found that the occupations with the lowest risk of being a ected by automation are projected to produce nearly 712,000 net new jobs between 2014 and 2024. As with any type of forecasting exercise, there are always going to be uncertainties associated with the predictions. However, we do hope that this study provides a tool to help guide future decision-making.

Nearly 42 percent of the Canadian labour force is at a high risk of being a ected by automation in the next decade or two.

INTRODUCTION

While job automation has been a key topic in many recent public discussions, it is not a new phenomenon. People have long been concerned that new technology would make their job obsolete. But even after decades of rapid technological advances, historical evidence from the U.S. shows that technology has yet to have any measurable impacts on aggregate unemployment levels. Even though in many industries technology has been the driving force behind major occupational shifts. i However, experts also suggest that the emergence and rapid adoption of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and advanced robotics, may result in the automation of occupations at an unprecedented rate. Examples of these disruptive technologies can be found everywhere from the 3D printer to the driverless car. Even jobs that we once thought were completely outside the realm of what a machine could do, such as truck driving, are at risk of being automated.
ii iii

Overall we discovered evidence from both sides of the debate. In certain occupations, job creation will likely occur, however, in others there will most likely be major task restructuring and, in some cases, potential job loss.

While these technologies can potentially threaten existing jobs, it is also important to recognize that they are also significant job creators that have the potential to improve productivity and raise overall living standards. So what do these technological trends mean for Canada? Are specific jobs at risk of being automated? Or, will technology be a great job creator? To understand the employment effects of technology, we applied methodologies from Oxford professors Frey and Osborne iv and McKinsey & Company v to Canadian labour force and demographic data.

4

The following outlines some of our major ndings: Nearly 42 percent of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk (70 percent or higher probability) of being a ected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years. Occupations with the highest risk of being a ected tend to be more routine, administrative and service oriented. People in these occupations are also less educated and earn less, on average, than the rest of the Canadian labour force. While this does not mean that these occupations will necessarily be lost, it does suggest that these occupations are more susceptible to being automated in the future. Using the Canadian Occupation Projection System (COPS), we found that the occupations with the lowest risk of being a ected by automation, which are correlated with higher earnings and education, are projected to produce nearly 712,000 net new jobs between 2014 and 2024. We also examined how automation will impact the tasks performed in each occupation. We found that approximately 42 percent of work activities that Canadians are paid for can be automated using existing technologies. We also found that nearly 18 percent of occupations could have 70 percent or more of their work activities currently automated. This suggests that technology has the potential to result in major occupational restructuring relatively soon.

We do recognize that future predictions are fraught with risk and uncertainty. We also recognize that as a result of a number of factors overall unemployment may not necessarily increase. However, we are hoping this report will help Canada's public and private sectors gain a deeper understanding of how automation impacts employment so that they can begin planning for the future.

CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE

Automation and its impact on the labour force has been the subject of academic inquiry for many years. To help Canadians understand the impact that technology can have on jobs, we drew upon the ndings and methodologies of some of the major researchers in the eld. The following section outlines the studies that we used to build or inform our analysis. In 2003, David H. Autor, et al., developed the Task Model to explain the impact of technology on the workforce. Their model showed that:

(1) Technology can be a substitute for human labour in routine tasks, (2) Technology simultaneously increases productivity in non-routine, cognitive and interactive tasks.vi

In a 2015 study of 17 countries, George Graetz and Guy Michaels showed that between 1993 and 2007, industrial robots increased labour productivity and had no signi cant e ect on aggregate hours worked. However, they did nd some evidence that these robots reduced hours worked for low-skilled and middle-skilled workers.
x

Two University of Oxford professors, Frey and Osborne, revisited the Task Model in their 2013 paper, The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization? They argued that with advances in machine learning and mobile robotics automation can occur much more easily in non-routine tasks. For These insights suggest that technology results Frey and Osborne, the expansion of what in labour market restructuring and not technology is capable of doing, as well as the necessarily long-term unemployment. For current pace of technological progress, means occupations where technology easily that more jobs may be at risk than ever before. xi substitutes for labour, jobs are o en lost and Using a novel methodology, their paper found workers are required to relocate to other that 47 percent of total U.S. employment is at industries. For the occupations that require high risk of being a ected by automation (with significant creativity, interaction and problem solving, technology often complements labour, a 70 percent orxiimore probability) over the next which raises productivity. This, in turn, lowers a 10 to 20 years. firm's costs and prices, which can increase demand and subsequently increase the need for additional labour. This improved productivity may also result in increased individual earnings and thus more demand for other goods and services. This creates a virtuous cycle that ultimately results in job creation. vii viii ix

6

There are a number of critiques of Frey and Osborne's ndings that suggest that automation may not occur at the scale predicted. The first is that their approach ignores many existing macroeconomic feedback mechanisms that result in increased labour demand. The second is that their estimates may have been overstated for a number of reasons, including: the speed and actual capabilities of technology, the relative cost of technology over labour, as well as societal preferences for humans over machines for many tasks. xiii xiv Finally, many also suggest that a focus on occupations may be misleading and believe that specific tasks, rather than xv entire occupations, will be automated. Building o of some of these critiques, a 2015 McKinsey & Company research report entitled Four Fundamentals of Workplace Automation, analyzed automation from a task perspective rather than an occupation perspective. They suggested very few occupations will be fully automated in the near or medium term. However, many will undergo signi cant transformation as a result of new technologies. They found that 45 percent of work activities that people are paid for in the U.S. could be automated today using existing technology. However, they also found that fewer than ve percent of occupations can be entirely xvi automated. A 2016 study by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), entitled The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis, also examined automation from a task-based perspective. Using Frey and Osborne's ndings and the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIACC), they estimated the probability of automation for a number of OECD countries.

Their approach also took into account that speci c jobs and tasks, and not whole occupations, are vulnerable to automation.xvii They found that only nine percent of the U.S. labour force is at a high risk of automation (with a 70 percent or more probability), xviii compared to Frey and Osborne's 47 percent. Similarly, they also found that nine percent of the Canadian labour force is at a high risk. xix Drawing on many of these studies, the following sections outline our ndings.

RESULTS

We began our analysis by using the ndings of Frey and Osborne to assess what proportion of Canadian occupations are at risk of being a ected by automation in the next 10 to 20 years. To do so, we used the 2011 National Household Survey xx to assess the composition of Canada's labour force based on future risk of automation. Our results show that nearly 42 percent ( gure 1) of the employed Canadian labour force is at a high risk of being a ected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years. This means that there is a 70 percent or higher probability that these jobs will be impacted by automation over this time period. However, based on the limitations of Frey and Osborne's ndings, it is important to understand that while these speci c occupations may be more likely to be automated, it does not necessarily mean that all of these jobs will be lost.

On the other hand, we also found that 36 percent of Canada's employed labour force is at a low risk of being a ected by automation. In line with the Task Model literature, these occupations will likely be complemented by technological advances, which could o set some of the unemployment e ects associated with automation.

In a recent report, Deloi e UK, using Frey and Osborne's methodology, discovered that between 2001 and 2015 occupations at a low risk of being a ected by automation grew by 3.5 million jobs in the United Kingdom, compared to the 800,000 high-risk jobs that were lost. For Deloi e, this suggests that technology has potentially contributed to signi cant job growth.xxi

Impact of Automation on Occupation
Figure 2 shows employment for each high-level Canadian occupation category based on its probability of automation. The vast majority of occupations that have a high risk of being affected by automation are in trades, transportation and equipment operation; natural resources and agriculture; sales and services; manufacturing and utilities; office support and general administration; as well as technical occupations in health, natural and applied sciences. Occupations that have a low risk of being affected by automation are fairly diverse, spanning from arts, culture, recreation and sport to management and professional occupations in a number of different fields such as education, law, health, nursing, as well as natural and applied sciences. When examining aggregate employment levels along the probability of automation axis, it becomes clear that there is a bimodal distribution. This shows that the bulk of Canadian employment falls into two distinct groups: one that is at a low risk of being a ected by automation, and the other that is at a high risk of being a ected by automation. Occupations directly in the middle of the spectrum occupy the lowest proportion of the Canadian labour force, but employment increases as probability approaches the high risk threshold.

Impact of Automation on Occupation
Top Five High Risk Occupations The data in gure 3 shows that the occupations at a high risk of being a ected by automation with the most employees are: Retail sales persons, 92% probability of automation and more than 656,000 employees, Administrative assistants, 96% probability of automation and nearly 329,000 employees, Food counter a endants and kitchen and kitchen helpers, 91.5% probability of automation and nearly 313,000 employees, Cashiers, 97% probability of automation and nearly 309,000 employees, and Transport truck drivers, 79% probability of automation and nearly 262,000 employees. Top Five Low Risk Occupations The occupations at a low risk of being a ected by automation with the most employees are: Retail and wholesale trade managers, 20.5% probability of automation and more than 363,000 employees, Registered nurses (psychiatric included), 0.9% probability of automation and more than 291,000 employees, Elementary and kindergarten teachers, 0.4% probability of automation and more than 271,000 employees, Early childhood educators and assistants, 0.7% probability of automation and nearly 188,000 employees, and Secondary school teachers, 0.8% probability of automation and nearly 174,000 employees. All of these findings suggest that over the next 10 to 20 years, automation will occur most significantly in occupations that are administrative, routine, or oriented toward sales and service. However, automation can also occur in occupations that are non-routine. The occupations least at risk appear to rely on humans' cognitive advantage over technology and require more job-specific skills, complex problem solving, as well as people management and oversight.

12

Referring to gure 4, the Canada-wide statistics for occupations at a high risk of being a ected by automation remain relatively consistent across provinces.

Ontario has the lowest proportion of the employed labour force at a high risk of being affected by automation at just over 41 percent, and P.E.I. has the highest proportion, at just over 45 percent.

Figure 5 indicates that the occupations most at risk of being a ected by automation have a much lower average income (received as wages and salaries) than occupations in other risk pro les. On average, people in occupations at a high risk of being affected by automation make over $33,000 a year, which is nearly $29,000 less than occupations at a low risk of being a ected by automation. To determine these gures, for each of the risk pro les a weighted average was calculated based on the average employment income for each speci c occupation and the occupation's corresponding proportion of the employed labour force.

We do acknowledge that wages and salaries are constantly in ux and have more than likely changed since 2011, but for the purposes of this analysis we are most interested in the relative incomes of occupations based on their risk of being a ected by automation.

In addition to earning less, those in occupations with a high risk of being affected by automation are also less educated. Figure 6 shows that just 12.7 percent of the labour force at a high risk of automation had a university education at a bachelor level or higher. The proportion of low-risk occupations with a university education is more than three times larger than the same proportion in high-risk occupations. This suggests that occupations that demand more university education are less likely to be at a risk of being a ected by automation. When examining the age distribution for each risk pro le, a few trends emerge. Figure 7 shows that employees in occupations with a high risk of being a ected by automation are

disproportionately between the ages of 15 to 24, whereas employees in occupations with a low risk of being a ected by automation are more likely to be "prime-aged workers," between 25 and 54. This means that Canada's core working population is more likely to be at a low risk of being affected by automation. However, it also means that Canada's younger and, to a lesser extent, older populations are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of automation. This could suggest that younger workers are more likely to be employed in entry-level jobs, which may be at a higher risk of being affected by automation.

We also used the Canadian Occupation Projection System (COPS) to determine how jobs in di erent risk pro les are projected to expand over time. Overall, we found that occupations at a low risk of being a ected by automation are expected to grow much more than those in the other risk profiles between 2014 and 2024. Figure 8 shows that during this period, there are expected to be nearly 712,000 new jobs in occupations at a low risk of being affected by automation, compared to nearly 396,000 new jobs in occupations at a high risk of being a ected by automation. It must be noted that these projections are based on a macroeconomic scenario that does not take automation into consideration. If automation impacts the Canadian labour force as predicted, employment in occupations at a high risk will likely grow more slowly than projected, or potentially contract. The e ect of automation on projected job creation in low-risk occupations will likely be more ambiguous.

Technology may complement labour, increase productivity and create more jobs in certain areas, but it may also substitute for labour in other areas. However, using this system presented a few challenges for our analysis. Since COPS tracks aggregates of speci c occupations, it only shows 292 occupation groups, as opposed to the full 500 occupations we considered in our analysis. To get around this, we calculated the average probability of all of the individual National Occupation Classi cations (NOCs) for each COPS aggregate. We felt this was a reasonable estimate, since the probabilities under each aggregate were relatively similar.

Impact Of Automation on Activities
We also applied the findings of the 2015 McKinsey & Company report to Canadian data to examine the automation of tasks rather than full occupations in the near term. Using National Household Survey data, we estimated that nearly 42 percent of Canadian work activities could be automated using current technologies. However, our findings also suggest that less than one percent of jobs in the labour market are fully automatable (meaning all of the tasks performed for the occupation could be automated). These occupations were primarily processing and manufacturing machine operators and related production workers. We also found that nearly 18 percent of Canada's labour force could have 70 percent or more of their work activities automated. When broken down, many of these occupations correspond to those at a high risk of being a ected by automation, identi ed using the Frey and Osborne methodology. This suggests that in the near term major job restructuring could occur in many of these occupations.

PROFILES

Examining speci c occupations helps to illustrate the automation predictions made using both methodologies. Transport truck drivers and retail salespersons both exhibit a high probability of being a ected by automation over the next 10 to 20 years. The data also shows that a large portion of what individuals in these occupations are currently paid for can be automated using existing technology. In these cases, technologies as simple as the self-checkout in grocery stores or as complicated as self-driving trucks can already make significant portions of what people in these occupations do obsolete.

On the other hand, senior managers and specialist physicians are at a low risk of having their occupations a ected by automation in the future, but could still have a large portion of what they do automated using currently demonstrated technology. In line with the rest of the labour force data, people in these low-risk occupations are more highly educated and earn more than the other occupations.

METHODOLOGY

To answer the question of how susceptible Canadian jobs are to automation, we utilized the ndings of Frey and Osborne and McKinsey & Company. Both studies are designed to address the question of automation in two different ways. Frey and Osborne estimated the proportion of occupations that can be automated over the next 10 to 20 years. They used the 2010 U.S. Department of Labor's O*Net data, which contains information about 903 occupations. They aggregated them to correspond to the 702 U.S Standard Occupation Classi cation (SOC) codes. Frey and Osborne then drew from machine learning experts to classify 70 occupations as either automatable or not, based on their task structures. Next, they identi ed whether these subjective classi cations were related to the bo lenecks of computerization, de ned as tasks that cannot be substituted by computers in the near term, which include perception and manipulation, creativity and social intelligence. To do so, for each of the 70 occupations they linked O*Net variables to each of the bo lenecks and developed a model to determine if they corresponded to an occupation's risk of being a ected by automation. The estimates of this model were then used to predict the probability of automation for the remaining 632 occupations.xxii The authors of the McKinsey study took a di erent approach. They examined the percentage of work activities that could be automated using existing technologies. The authors analyzed 2,000 detailed work activities for 800 U.S. occupations. They then assessed these activities against 18 identi ed capabilities that they determined could be automated.xxiii

Both studies use U.S. SOC codes in their analysis. In Canada, we use the NOC system. To apply the U.S. studies' probabilities to the Canadian context, we linked all 500 four-digit NOC codes with six-digit U.S. SOC codes using a crosswalk methodology. While crosswalk methodologies vary, they have been successfully applied by Statistics Canada, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Nesta.

19

To assess occupational matches, we used the NOC descriptor fields developed by Employment and Social Development Canada and the detailed SOC descriptions in the US O*Net database. The crosswalk process involved a series of steps: Where possible, we created 1:1 matches between U.S. SOCs and Canadian NOCs. From there, we applied the ndings from each study on a one-to-one basis. When a single NOC matched more than one SOC, we selected all relevant SOCs using descriptor elds. From there we took the average ndings from the studies and applied them to the Canadian occupation. When a single SOC applied to more than one NOC, we linked it to all relevant NOCs and applied the ndings. When there was an imperfect or unclear match between codes, we took advantage of existing crosswalks developed by Statistics Canada and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, linking occupation codes to the International Standard Classi cation of Occupations (ISCO). We were able to use ISCO codes as an intermediary, linking the NOC to the ISCO and the ISCO to the various applicable SOCs. Military NOCs were removed from the study, as they had no equivalent SOC. Similarly, any occupation codes not included in either study were removed from the analysis. This resulted in six occupation codes being excluded from the analysis

Conclusion and Discussion

This goal of this report was to leverage existing studies to give Canadians a be er understanding of the potential impact of automation in Canada. Our ndings suggest that a large portion of the Canadian labour force is at a high risk of feeling the impact of automation in the next decade or two. At the same time, we also found that a large proportion of the tasks that Canadians currently perform can be automated using existing technology. This automation is predicted to take place primarily in occupations that are administrative, routine, or oriented toward sales and service. Our ndings suggest that while these jobs may not necessarily be lost, they are more susceptible to the e ects of automation than others and, in the near term, may be subject to signi cant task restructuring. On the other hand, we also found Canada's employed labour force is comprised of a large number of occupations that require highly-skilled workers who command high wages and are at a low risk of being negatively a ected by automation. These occupations are expected to grow much more quickly than the rest of the labour force. This suggests that more highly-skilled labour will be a signi cant driver of Canada's future growth.

It is also important when assessing these predictions to consider the role that technology can play in complementing labour, which has the potential to o set any negative employment e ects.

21

Moving forward Canada's public and private sectors can help to mitigate the potential negative e ects technology can have on employment, while ensuring Canadians are able to leverage technology to innovate, improve productivity and standards of living. The success of these e orts will require signi cant co-ordination between governments, educational institutions and the private sector. Some steps to be taken include: Future study: A deeper dive into high-risk occupations will determine their ability to withstand automation and technology-based restructuring. It will also be important to know the demographic pro le of these occupations. Whether individuals in high-risk occupations are older and slated for retirement or mostly starting their careers will necessitate very di erent responses. Focus on Canadian strengths: To o set any potential negative e ects on employment, e orts should also be taken to identify Canada's domestic technological strengths and ensure that the innovators and entrepreneurs behind them, have the nancing, talent and supports needed to innovate and scale up. This can help create new jobs that are not only at a low risk of being a ected by automation, but are using new technology to grow. Education and training: The negative e ects of technology on employment can also be mitigated through education and training. From our study it is clear that jobs with the least risk of being a ected by automation require the most education. Employees in high-risk occupations also tend to be disproportionately young and lower paid.

Concerted e orts from industry, governments and educational institutions are vital to ensure that these individuals are able to upgrade their skills through education, providing the technical and so skills for the jobs of tomorrow. Proactive training and retraining should also be implemented by the public and private sectors to help individuals in high-risk occupations adjust to potential occupational restructuring or job loss.
