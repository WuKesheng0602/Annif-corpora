ABSTRACT
The Pathogen Abatement Effects of Nutrient Management Policies: The Ontario Nutrient Management Act, 2002
©Kate Erin Stiefelmeyer, 2003 Master of Applied Science in the Program of Environmental Applied Science and Management Nutrient management strategies and regulations provide for the optimal management of waste materials containing nutrients that may be applied to the land. They are enacted to protect water sources while maximizing the economic and biological value of the nutrients. The province of Ontario has enacted a new Nutrient Management Act (2002), the purpose of which is to enable the province to enact regulations that establish standards for the management of nutrients. Livestock waste not only contains nutrients, but also contains many pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Although these contaminants are abundant in livestock waste, no legislation has been specifically designed for their control~ instead,nutrient management policies are assumed to be proxies for pathogen management. Therefore, the question is, will nutrient management policies that have been designed specifically to control nutrients also ensure a safe drinking water supply through the control of pathogens? This study focused on four pathogens: E. coli OI57:H7, Salmonella, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, and the existing scientific knowledge regarding the fate and transport of these pathogens in agricultural environments. The existing scientific knowledge was then used to analyze the effectiveness of the regulations of the new Nutrient Management Act (2002) at controlling pathogenic microorganisms. The analysis showed the regulations used to reduce the risk of horizontal and vertical transport of wastes were inadequate at controlling pathogens, although the regulations may have been adequate for the control of nutrients and soil erosion. The scientific literature showed that pathogens have the ability to be transported in many soil types, in tilled soils, and in the absence of rain. The survivability of pathogenic microorganisms further enhances their ability to be transported. The results of the review of nutrient management policies in Canada, the United States and Europe show that there is a gap when using nutrient management policies to control pathogens. The majority of policies do not address critical pathogen control issues such as herd health, biosecurity practices, and treatments used during storage that could aid in pathogen load reduction. The study concluded that addressing pathogen load is critical because the ability of pathogens to survive and be transported in numerous environments leaves an uncertainty in the effectiveness of the land application regulations at reducing the risk of pathogen contamination.

Chapter One: Introduction
1.1 Background
Nutrient management strategies and regulations are intended to provide for the optimal management of waste materials containing nutrients that may be applied to land. They are enacted to protect water sources while maximizing the economic and biological value of the nutrients. The Province of Ontario has created a new Nutrient Management Act (Bill 81) which received royal assent on June 2i\ 2002. The purpose of the legislation is to enable the province to enact regulations that establish standards for the management of materials containing nutrients I. The Act requires farmers and other generators or users of such materials to comply with those standards to ensure that nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, will be controlled. Livestock waste not only contains nutrients, but also includes many pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, and it is only recently that concern has been expressed about the possible spread of these pathogens to the human population. The measures laid out in the Nutrient Management Act (2002) aim to control nutrients in manure and municipal biosolids applied to agricultural lands, which also contain pathogens, from reaching ground and surface waters and causing environmental degradation and/or waterborne disease outbreaks, similar to the one that occurred in Walkerton, Ontario, May 2001. The purpose of the Act is to provide for the management of materials containing nutrients in ways that will enhance the protection of the natural environment and provide a sustainable future for the agricultural community (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food, 2002). The Nutrient Management Act (2002) does not include drinking water protection as an objective to be achieved by its provisions; nonetheless an end result of the Act will be some protection of human health from pathogen-induced waterborne illness. The Act is based on many current best management practices in nutrient management. The regulations currently being reviewed include specified standards applied to: the size, capacity, and location of

J Nutrient control is important when agricultural operations apply nutrients to increase crop productivity and yield because excess concentrations of phosphorous and nitrogen will pollute water sources. Excess phosphorous encourages excessive growth of aquatic plants. depleting the oxygen supply for other plants and wildlife and leading to unsustainable eutrophication. Excess nitrogen in water supplies not only affects environmental health but also human health. Ontario's Drinking Water Objectives require no more than IOppm of nitrogen in drinking water supplies.

structures that are used to store material containing nutrients; rates of application; the time and manner in which materials containing nutrients may be applied to lands; minimum separation distances between lands to which materials containing nutrients are applied and specified distances to and uses of geographic features, such as open bodies of water, or wells; and vegetated buffer strips. Historically, it was assumed that pathogenic organisms could not travel great distances through soil due to filtration; however recent studies suggest that bacterial and protozoan transport are significant and lead to the contamination of water sources (Wall, 1998; Brush, 1999). The presence of pathogenic organisms such as Escherichia coli 0 157:H7, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia in water supplies have been implicated in gastrointestinal illness outbreaks among both immunohealthy and immunocompromised patients (Fleminget al. 1997). Along with extreme viability in the environment, these organisms have minute infectious dose minima. The infectious dose range in humans is very low, ranging from 10-100 organisms (Fleming et al. 1997). The prevalence of these pathogens is also a cause for concern. Rahn et al. (1997) studied the prevalence of E. coli on dairy farms and found that 87.5% of the farms studied were positive for verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC). As well, Fleming et al. (1997) studied the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and determined that 90% of the swine operations examined tested positive, and 65% of the dairy operations with solid manure handling systems. These rates suggest that if manure is improperly managed and is transported through agricultural land to water sources that there is a high risk it will contain a number of microorganisms that are potentially harmful to the pUblic. Little attention across Canada has been given to developing manure management practices that are specifically designed to deal with pathogens (Goss, 2001) and water pollution (Johns, 2000), although the fact that some humans can become infected only after ingesting 10 oocysts or cysts, and that pathogens are prevalent in multiple hosts, suggest the importance of developing policies to focus on the control of pathogen contamination in drinking water as well as nutrient contamination. These organisms are also of particular concern because Oyptosporidium oocysts cannot be controlled by chlorination levels that are safe for use in domestic water supplies (Goss, 2001), and treatment practices require large amounts of water to detect them. The cost to detect and treat these pathogens in drinking water is substantial,

therefore treatment measures have been limited and the most effective approach for managing microbiological risks from drinking water is source protection. Due to the common source of nutrients and pathogens in agricultural practices, the Nutrient Management Act (2002) will to some extent act as a pathogen management Act as well, and will help to inhibit pathogen transport and protect water sources. The question is to what extent will it successfully manage pathogens?
It is unclear at this stage whether the Nutrient Management Act (2002) will provide the

appropriate mix of regulations that are based on science and those that are socio-economically based. Science-based regulations ensure that the protection of human health from drinking water is guaranteed because of the objective nature and value neutrality of evidence. When facts count, and when human health is at risk, it is wise to require policy to observe the rules of the scientific method (Gori, 1996). In order to ensure that the Nutrient Management Act (2002) will be effective in protecting source water, certain regulations, such as the minimum distance separation requirements, must be determined through scientific analysis and hypothesis testing of pathogen survival and transport to ensure that pathogens cannot survive transportation to water sources. It is the testing of hypotheses that actually establish knowledge firm enough to translate into useful technologies and policies that will guarantee safety (Gori, 1996). Most jurisdictions throughout Canada and the United States have established recommended agricultural best management practices and guidelines including minimum separation distances (MSDs) for manure application to protect water bodies and drinking water wells from agricultural nutrients, but lack policies specifically created for the control of pathogenic organisms and the risk of waterborne disease outbreaks. It is assumed that the nutrient management policies act as proxies for pathogen management policies; therefore pathogens are essentially non-targeted contaminants controlled under the umbrella of nutrient management. With the control of pathogens being based on nutrient management policies, can the public be certain that human health and water sources are being protected?

1.2 Proposed Hypothesis
Do current policies ensure a safe drinking water supply through the control o.fpathogens based on objective scient(/ic data?

The new Nutrient Management Act (2002) was to some degree created to protect water bodies from agricultural contaminants and ensure a clean supply of drinking water. Pathogens

are one such agricultural contaminant, and are delivered to the environment through manure application. Although the Nutrient Management Act (2002) does not expressly attempt to control the transport of pathogens, it will do so to some degree since both nutrients and pathogens are delivered to the environment through the same agricultural practices. This study determines whether this policy will ensure a safe drinking water supply through the control of pathogens, by determining whether certain regulations within the policy that have been specifically designed to control nutrients and sediments will also control pathogenic organisms. There are significant needs for research in the field of manure management if water resources are to be protected from contaminants originating in manure. One of those needs is to concentrate efforts on determining the fate and transport of pathogens and another is to determine whether policies enacted to protect drinking water sources from nutrients also work to protect water sources from pathogens. This assessment of pathogen survival and the probability of water contamination, and the regulations imposed to control them, will illustrate to agricultural managers and the public the degree of reliability such regulations achieve in protecting water sources from pathogens and the health ofthe environment.

1.3 Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this study is to determine if regulations sufficiently limit pathogen survival and transport to control pathogens in order to protect drinking water supplies. This purpose falls out of the urgent need to both protect Ontario's drinking water supply and assure the public that policy makers are enacting regulations that will maximize the protection of their water and ultimately their health. After the events in Walkerton, the public and the agricultural industry need to be assured that the new policies that will be enacted will make certain that the risk of outbreaks from waterborne pathogens and bacteria will be minimized or eliminated. The events at Walkerton also remind us of the serious effects that waterborne bacteria or pathogens can have on our health if we are not managing them properly. Two ways in which to eliminate this risk are to enact regulations that are based on scientifically proven data and to ensure that all forms of risk, including pathogens and bacteria, will be managed. There are three major objectives in this study: 1. To evaluate thefate and transport ofpathogens in agricultural soils through research that has already been conducted.

The purpose of this objective is to determine whether the regulations dealing with the transport and survivability of nutrients that are proposed by the Nutrient Management Act (2002) are effective at controlling the transport of pathogens to water bodies, based on my findings from Objective One. This objective also brings together my findings from Objective Two and allows me to identify the strengths and the weaknesses of the Act and its comprehensiveness compared to the others that I have reviewed.

1.4 Outline
The thesis document has been laid out as follows. Chapter Two: Literature Review, discusses five relevant issues to the thesis work including: manure-borne pathogens E. coli.

Cryptosporidium. Giardia. and Salmonella, the treatment and management of agricultural
waste, water quality, the risk to human health from manure-borne pathogens, and source protection. Chapter Three: Nutrient Management Policies; examines nutrient management policies and guidelines that have been created and/or enacted in Canada, the United States, and other countries. The examination involves storage guidelines, land application guidelines, and treatment guidelines. Discussion of innovative strategies and the comprehensiveness of the
strategies are included. Chapter Four: Transport and Survival of Pathogens, examines existing

scientific knowledge regarding viability and transport of pathogenic microorganisms in various agricultural environments including manure and slurry, soil, and water sources. Discussion includes knowledge gaps in the issue. Chapter Five: Pathogen Control using Nutrient Management Policy focuses on whether the regulations in the Nutrient Management Act

(2002) are in convergence with existing scientific knowledge on the subject since most nutrient management regulations are assumed to be proxies for pathogen management · This chapter determines whether the nutrient management strategies ensure the control of pathogens as well and includes a discussion on the variables in pathogen management that have been neglected in the nutrient management strategies. Lastly, Chapter Six discusses the findings and suggests future research efforts in order that this problem can be better examined.

In June 2003, the final regulations of the Nutrient Management Act. 2002 were published. With respect to this analysis no major changes resulted by reviewing the most recent set of regulations.

Chapter Two: Literature Review
This literature review is intended to investigate the survival and transportation characteristics ofthe principle pathogenic microorganisms found in manure. It discusses their

importance in agricultural environments and their importance to public health. The application of livestock manure onto agricultural land is a common practice in most agricultural operations. Instead of being treated as a waste and a nuisance, livestock manure is regarded as a valuable fertilizer resource. Due to its high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous, manure can replace many commercial fertilizers and decrease those costs for

agricultural operators. However, spreading manure on agricultural land is not without environmental risk. There is the potential to contaminate water sources through runoff or subsurface transport of contaminants into the groundwater supply. In the past, environmental concerns have focused on nutrient impacts, particularly when farm and non-farm land uses, such as subdivisions, were generally segregated. An additional risk that has not received much attention in the past is the large number of microorganisms that are shed in these wastes and their potential to cause waterborne disease. Historically, the policies and regulations that

(

jurisdictions have enacted, including best management practices to minimize the environmental impact of land application on soil and water resources, have focused on controlling nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous. It is also important to note that in Ontario policies were primarily voluntary and not adequately enforced pre-Walkerton (Johns, 2000). Most nutrient management policies and guidelines are assumed to be proxies for microorganism control; therefore there are very few regulations that are specifically intended to control pathogen transport and survival.

The principle microorganisms of concern are those that are pathogenic, specifically parasitic protozoa and bacteria, because they are capable of causing disease in a host. Pathogenic microorganisms present in livestock waste include but are not limited to Escherichia coli, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella. Pathogens are of concern not only because they cause disease but because they are extremely abundant in infected livestock

indigenous bacteria per gram (Jiang et a1. 2002). In addition, pathogens in manure raise concerns because they are resistant to a number of environmental factors and can survive for long periods in manure, soil and water environments. 2.1.1 Escherichia coli and E. coli 0157:H7
E. coli are a bacterial species that live in the intestinal tracts of multiple hosts and are

shed in feces. E. coli 0 157:H7 differs from other normal intestinal E. coli strains because it carries several toxin-producing genes capable of affecting humans. This strain is a fairly new pathogen that was first implicated in disease outbreaks in 1982 and accounts for approximately 1% of all known strains (Kaper and O'Brien, 1998). Cattle are the primary hosts of this pathogen (Jones, 1999), and were first identified as carriers in both Canada and the United States in 1986 (Scottish Executive and Food Standards Agency, 2001). Other animals have also been shown to be carriers, including sheep. In cattle, E. coli 0157:H7 can reside in the gut with no observable effects on the host. On the other hand, this strain of bacteria is highly infectious to humans and has the capacity to produce lethal toxins in the intestine once it has colonized there (Jones, 1999). Human infection by E. coli can cause a range of symptoms from haemorrhagic colitis (severe bloody diarrhea), haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) which can lead to kidney damage or the need for blood transfusions, or non-bloody diarrhea. Most patients infected with
E. coli 0157 will experience a bout of bloody diarrhea a few days after oral ingestion and most

recover within 2 weeks. Although, when kidney damage does occur, about 50% of those patients will require dialysis (Jones, 1999). Immunocompromised patients, induding the elderly, the very young, AIDS patients, or chemotherapy patients, often experience more severe symptoms which have led to fatalities. Although this illness is not common, it is serious since more than half of the patients infected with E. coli are hospitalized. E. coli 0157:H7 causes approximately 40,000 infections and 250 deaths each year in the United States (Russell et al. 2000). Symptoms from infection disappear within a few days and most patients feel healthier in 2 weeks, but patients continue to excrete E. coli in their feces for between two to four months (Jones, 1999). When infected with E. coli, hosts, both livestock and humans, can excrete up to 10

infectious dose of E. coli in humans makes the control of exposure to this pathogenic bacterium important. The infectious dose at which full symptoms can develop can be as low as 10 cells (Jones, 1999; Russell et al. 2000). Many studies have been conducted to determine this bacterium's prevalence in agricultural operations and natural environments. Varying degrees of prevalence have been identified which may be due to a number of factors including livestock type or age studied, management factors, sample collection and detection methods or experimental design. In the 1980s when E. coli infection was most associated with the consumption of undercooked beef, Mafu et al. (1989) studied the feces of slaughtered cattle and concluded a prevalence of E. coli in 99% of the animals studied. This prevalence rate is extremely high and may be so because those cattle had been recently transported. A feedlot study found an approximately 3-fold higher prevalence in cattle recently shipped to feedlots than in randomly selected cattle that had not been recently shipped and had been on feed for several months (Kaper and O'Brien, 1998). In 1997, Hancock et al. studied the prevalence of E. coli 0157:H7 in dairy herds in the Pacific Northwest and determined that 75% of the herds studied tested positive for E. coli 0157:H7. Rahn et al. (1997) also studied the prevalence of E. coli in dairy farm cattle in Ontario, and concluded that on 87.5% of the farms studied, cattle tested positive for verotoxinproducing E. coli (VTEC). The study also concluded that VTEC infection among livestock seems to be both transient, as the infection disappears within a herd in a few months and returns later, as well as seasonal since the greatest numbers of positively-tested livestock were found in the summer months. This finding reiterates Jones (1999) and Chapman et al. (1997) whose work also stated that E. coli infection is seasonal with excretion rates being highest in the spring and summer. Chapman concluded that the prevalence of E. coli in livestock ranged from 4.8-36.8% throughout the year depending on the season. There are many studies that prove that this pathogen has the ability to adapt to various environmental pressures. Robertson and Edberg (1997) state that bacteria such as E. coli can mutate to a form a new cell with selected traits that enable it to adapt to the environment it is in. Adaptation takes time, therefore ifthe stresses of the environment are severe and changes are quick, the bacteria are less likely to survive, for example when E. coli are heated and/or desiccated. Various environments within an agricultural operation are optimal for E. coli

survival including manure storage tanks, stock piles, water troughs, and agricultural fields. For example, Kudva et al. (1998) showed that E. coli can remain viable in non-aerated cattle manure for greater than 21 months, but if the manure piles are aerated, E. coli survival is reduced to 4 months. Munch et al. (1987) also showed that the T 90
4

of E. coli was greater in

cattle slurry that had not been aerated compared to manure that had been. Himanthongkham et al. (1999 and 2000) studied the survival of E. coli in incubated cow manure and slurry and poultry manure and slurry at various temperatures and showed that persistence is greater under lower temperatures (4°C) than at higher temperatures (20 and 37°C). Given that water troughs in grazing areas have been found to contain E. coli 0157:H7, Kaper and O'Brien (1998) suggest that water troughs play an important role in the transmission of E. coli throughout a herd. Land application of manure distributes E. coli onto soil surfaces and E. coli have been found to survive within the soil matrix. Fenlon et al. (2000) showed that E. coli can persist in various types of soil, but in loam or clay loam soils it can survive for greater than 175 days. Sjogren (1994) investigated the effects of moisture content on the survival of E. coli and determined that in sandy loam soils, E. coli could remain viable for 408 days in saturated conditions and 285 days at 15% moisture content. Following an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness associated with E. coli found in sheep feces at a Scout Camp in Scotland, Ogden et al. (2002) investigated and determined that E. coli persisted for 105 days on the surface of the grassland area. Because of its persistence in soil environments, it is common for this bacterium to reach water supplies either through adsorption onto soil particles and which are being carried with runoff or leaching through the soil matrix to reach groundwater. Wang and Doyle (1998) studied the survival of E. coli in various types of water including lake, municipal and reservoir sources. They concluded that E. coli could survive in a viable but non-culturable state in municipal water, reservoir water and lake water for greater than 91 days, 81 days, and 67 days respectively, all at 25°C. McGee et al. (2002) investigated the survival of E. coli in farm water in various places within a livestock operation and found that the E. coli survived for 14, 24 and 31 days; outdoors in a field, in a farmyard shed, and in a lab at 15°C respectively. Lastly, Warburton et al. (1998) investigated the survival of E. coli in bottled spring water and

discovered that because of the absence of competition from indigenous bacteria, E. coli were still detectable after 247 days. Since a number of recent waterborne disease outbreaks have taken place E. coli is becoming much more recognizable to the public, agricultural operators and policy makers. There has also been an increasing amount of research in the last ten years on its survival and transport and how to control it from reaching drinking water supplies. In July 2001 a report was released from the Scottish Task Force on E. coli, comprised of experts in a number of areas including public health, agriculture, water quality, and policy. The report discussed the incidence of E. coli in the environment, its risk to human health, the effectiveness of existing programs to prevent its infection and future management techniques that may be needed to protect the population from waterborne illness. Currently a number of the Task Force's recommendations are being accepted and implemented into Scotland's Prevention of Pollution from Agricultural Activity code to include more specific recommendations regarding the management of E. coli.
2.1.2 Cryptosporidium

There are six known species of Cryptosporidiurn, but the only species that is known to cause infection in animals and humans is C. parvurn (Fleming et al. 1999). C. parvurn is a microscopic waterborne protozoan parasite that can cause gastrointestinal illness in a wide variety of mammals including humans, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and horses (Atwill, 1995; Wall et aI., 1998; Tate et aI., 2000; Harter et aI., 2000). Intestinal illness brought on by C.
parvurn is known as Cryptosporidiosis, an untreatable case of severe watery diarrhea that can

last up to several weeks, which is usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting and fevers. In patients with compromised immune systems including the,young and elderly, this disease can be fatal (Grazyk et aI., 2000; Harter et aI., 2000; Tate et aI., 2000). Cryptosporidiosis was first identified in cattle in 1971 and by 1972 it was isolated in humans with severe diarrhea (Rose,
1997). Cryptosporidium and Giardia (see 2.1.3) are both protozoan parasites; infected hosts

shed cysts or oocysts, in the case of C. parvum, into feces. These oocysts are tiny oval eggs, 46 11m in diameter, that are capable of surviving in the environment and can establish infection in another host through oral ingestion (Fleming et al. 1999; Harter et al. 2000) Zoonotic 5 transmission is very common as a means of spreading the disease. Many animals have been

implicated in the transmission of the infection to humans (Rose 1997); see Appendix 2.1 for a list of the animals and the studies that are cited. In cattle, infection and shedding of the oocysts is concentrated in calves under a month of age (Olson et al. 1999), although there have been reports that older cattle have shed the oocysts as well (Atwill, 1995). Grazyk et al. (2000) studied the correlation between Cryptosporidium infection and age of cattle; they found that the prevalence of oocyst-positive calf manure samples (68%) was statistically higher than the prevalence (26%) observed for the samples originating from heifers and cows. Once ingested, excystation of the oocyst occurs within the small intestine of the host. Toxic sporosites are released and attack the epithelium. Reproduction cycles take place and oocysts are shed in vast numbers. Infected humans and animals can pass up to 10 billion

Cryptosporidium oocysts per day (Marshal et aI., 1997; Atwill, 1995; Harter et aI., 2000; Pell,
1997). Symptoms of infection can last up to 18 days in humans but even after infected patients have recovered, they may continue to excrete large numbers of the protozoan for up to a few months. Like E. coli, the infectious dose of this pathogen is very low, therefore only a few infected people or animals are capable of contaminating large amounts of water (Olson et aI. 1999). Due to the pathogen's low infectious dose and hardy oocyst, it is able to survive and persist in the agricultural environment. Fleming et at. (1997) studied the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in agricultural operations in Ontario and found that Cryptosporidium was more prevalent in swine operations than in dairy operations with either liquid or solid manure handling systems. 90% of swine operations tested positive for Cryptosporidium at least once throughout the study, whereas 65 and 50% of dairy farms with solid and liquid manure handling systems tested positive, respectively. Another study conducted in Quebec by Ruest et at. (1998) found that 88% of 505 dairy farms tested in the province were positive for Cryptosporidium. In 1991, LeChevalier et al. (1991 a, 1991 b) found that 88% of raw water and 27% of filtered water samples tested were infected with Cryptosporidium.

Oyptosporidium has been shown to retain its infectivity in the environment for long
periods of time, particularly when associated with fecal material (Grazyk et aI. 2000). Robertson et al. (1992) studied cattle manure inoculated with 2.8 x 107 CFU/25L of C. parvum and found that after 176 days, 36.9% of the oocysts were still viable. Olson et al. (1999) studied the survival of Oyptosporidium in calf feces at varying temperatures and concluded

that at -4, 4, and 25°C, oocysts remained viable for greater than 84, 56, and 28 days respectively. Olson also studied the survival of Cryptosporidium in soil in a laboratory environment and found that at temperatures of -4 to 4°C the pathogen survived for greater than 84 days. This ability to survive in soil and manure allows oocysts the chance to be transported in runoff from fields or drainage from manure storage areas into water sources where it has also been shown that they can persist. For example, Robertson et al. (1992) studied the viability of C. parvum in river water and tap water. There was no significant difference in the results of the two experiments and the research team concluded that after 176 days approximately 1% of the oocysts remained viable. Although 1% does not seem great, Robertson et al. used an inoculation containing 2.8 x 10 oocysts, therefore 2,800,000 oocysts remained viable after 176 days. Olson et al. (1999) also studied the survival rate of
Cryptosporidium in sterile distilled water at various temperatures. They found that Cryptosporidium survived better at lower temperatures (-4°C and 4"C) than at higher
7

temperatures (25"C) but remained viable in all situations tested for greater than 70 days. Other significant factors affecting the survival of Cryptosporidium in surface waters include the presence of predators, and exoenzymes produced by autochthonous microorganisms. The ability of Cryptosporidium to survive in drinking water is a concern to public health officials and water treatment plant (WTP) operators.

c. parvum is one of the most difficult

microorganisms to control because it is resistant to chlorination at levels that are safe for treatment and human consumption (Atwill, 1995; Pell, 1997; Gostin et al. 2000), therefore WTPs that use chlorination as a means of protection are essentially overlooking C. parvum. There are many water treatment facilities that did not give appropriate attention to
Cryptosporidium in their treatment processes until it was too late. In 1993 and 1994, one-third

of all waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States were attributed to either
Cryptosporidium or Giardia (PeB, 1997). 2.1.3 Giardia Giardia is similar to Cryptosporidium in that it is a common microscopic protozoan

parasite that infects the intestinal tract of its host and has been responsible for waterborne disease outbreaks worldwide (Fleming et aI., 1999; Olson et aI., 1999). The species of most concern is G. lamblia because it is the strain that is infectious to mammals and birds (Fleming et aI., 1999; Olson et aI., 1999). The environmentally hardy state of Giardia is a cyst. These

cysts are football shaped eggs 8-1 OJ..lm in diameter, slightly larger than Cryptosporidium, and are excreted in the feces of infected hosts. When ingested, the cyst passes through the stomach and excystation takes place due to the amount of acid in the stomach environment (Marshall et a1. 1997). Infection occurs via the fecal-oral route and is zoonotic, therefore agricultural operators must take precautions. Giardia infection results in a disease called Giardiasis, otherwise known as beaver fever 6 · Giardiasis results in severe diarrhea and weight loss in cattle and humans (Olson et al. 1999; Mapfumo et a1. 2002). The main reservoirs for Giardia cysts on farms are animals younger than six months. Infected animals and humans can pass up to 10 million cysts per gram offeces (Olson et aI, 1999), therefore it takes only a small number of infected patients to contaminate water sources. Like C. parvum oocysts, Giardia cysts are hardy and resistant to many environmental stressors including water treatment processes (Olson et a1. 1999; Hooda et a1. 2000), therefore due to the large numbers of cysts that can be passed per day, prevention of the disease is important. It is also important to control the spread of the disease because the infectious dose for humans can be as low as 10 cysts (Olson et a1. 1999; Pell, 1997; Mapfumo et al. 2002). Prevalence of Giardia in agricultural operations has been reported to be as high as 67% in swine operations, Xiao et al. (1994) reported the prevalence in swine operations to range between 7 and 67%. Olson et a1. (1999) studied prevalence rates in various ages of swine and found that prevalence was greater in adult swine (19%) than in younger animals (3%). In a British Columbia province-wide survey, 68% of raw water samples and 59% of chlorinated samples were cyst-positive (Isaac-Renton et a1. 1996). None ofthe tested sites were defined as pristine, and many had agricultural operations nearby; none had restricted access and none were downstream from large urban sewage discharges. LeChavalier et a1. (1991 a and 1991 b) also studied the presence of Giardia cysts in raw and filtered water in the United States and detected cysts in 81 % of the raw water samples and 17% of the filtered samples. These studies have shown that Giardia is resistant to treatment processes and therefore it is not surprising that in 1993 and 1994, it was implicated along with Oyptosporidium, in one-third of all waterborne disease outbreaks. These statistics show why the control of this pathogen's spread is essential in protecting public health.
It is known as 'beaver fever' because beaver are common carriers of the organism and shed it into natural waterways. Many campers who drink river water have been infected with Giardia and experience severe bouts of diarrhea.

2.1.4 Salmonella
Salmonella are gram-negative bacteria. There are more than 1200 types of Salmonella, but only a selected few cause illness in animals and humans (Nova Scotia Agricultural College, 2002). Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteriditis are the most common strains of Salmonella that have caused human illness in North America (Centre for Disease Control, 2003). Illnesses include typhoid fever and food poisoning. Salmonella live in the intestinal tract of their host and are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, usually through contaminated food or water. Once Salmonella are ingested, they make their way to the intestine. Once in the intestine, they attach to the wall and penetrate the wall to make their way into the liver or spleen. In these organs, Salmonella can reproduce and make its way back to the intestine (Jones and Matthews, 1975). The most common disease called Salmonellosis, causes patients to develop diarrhea, fever, and severe cramps that can last anywhere from 4-7 days. Most patients recover without treatment but there are severe cases in which dehydration can take place and patients may need to be hospitalized. If the infection enters the bloodstream, proper treatment with antibiotics is necessary and some cases have been fatal (Centre for Disease Control, 2003). Patients with impaired immune systems, the elderly and infants, also may suffer more severe symptoms. Cattle are the primary carriers of the bacteria and can survive without showing symptoms or shedding the bacteria in their feces (Clinton et aI., 1979; Kearney et aI., 1993). When hosts undergo various stresses, they can become active carriers of the disease and shed the organisms (Clinton et aI., 1979). Cattle nonnally excrete less than 1000 organisms per gram of manure when infected (Clinton et aI., 1979). The infective dose for humans can be low as 15-20 cells, and depends on the age and health of the host as well as strain differences in the bacteria. The danger in controlling Salmonella infection is that it does have such a low infection dose and healthy carriers can spread the disease unknowingly into pastures and water supplies. In agricultural operations, Salmonella are most often found in swine and poultry manure (Goss et al. 200 I), although their prevalence in cattle manure can at times be significant. Jones and Matthews (1975) examined cattle slurry for pathogenic bacteria and found a Salmonella incidence rate of 11 %. The authors note that this conclusion was based on one examination and the actual contamination rate may be even higher. However, this rate seems consistent with Clinton et al. (1979) who also studied the incidence of Salmonella in

15

feedlot manure and found that of the 505 pens sampled, 49 were positive (9%) for the bacteria. The authors also noted those operations, where Salmonella were present, had a higher incidence rate within the herd. When Salmonella are excreted into the environment they can persist for some time. Tamasi (1981) studied the survival of Salmonella in liquid manure when it was applied to garden soil and sand. On garden soil, the bacteria survived for 96 days at 8°C and in the sand for 131 days. Tamasi also examined the transport of the bacteria under the same conditions and found that they could travel in excess of 160cm in the soil matrix. These transport and survival rates allow for the potential of Salmonella to reach distant water supplies. Bitton et al. (1983) have shown that if Salmonella could make its way into groundwater sources they can survive for longer than 15 days. Any microorganisms capable of being suspended in water can be carried great distances through a watershed. Therefore, the bacteria and protozoa discussed have this ability and their control may require management at the source in agricultural livestock operations.

2.2 The Treatment and Management of Agricultural Wastes
Land application of agricultural waste is an opportunity to tum a waste source into a valuable resource. Considering that in Ontario alone, 30.9 billion litres of manure were produced in 1996, this is an important use (Goss et al. 2001). Miller et al. (1989) computed that the manure produced in Ontario in 1989 had a fertilizer replacement value of $158 million. Unfortunately, this method ofreuse and disposal is not without risk due to the large amounts of nutrients and microorganisms that are contained in this waste. Firstly, these natural fertilizers are much more difficult to handle because without testing for every nutrient and microorganism there is no way of knowing exactly how much is contained in the waste. Whereas in store-bought fertilizer the exact amounts of nutrients are known and no microorganisms will be added. Secondly, it has been shown that the microorganisms contained in the waste can survive in various environments under varying temperatures and saturations. It was assumed that bacteria had a very short life once outside the host, but Conboy and Goss (2001) state that because most of the microorganisms in a farm environment have been excreted with feces, their survival is enhanced due to the presence of organic matter and a carbon source. This allows the microorganisms to persist in an isolated and protected environment. This fact, as well as the fact that many pathogenic organisms such as
Oyptosporidium are resistant to chlorination and the normal treatment processes at water

utilities, strengthens the argument for the careful treatment and management of agricultural wastes at the farm level. Most provinces and states in North America have enacted policies or have best management guidelines in place regarding the handling, and utilization of agricultural waste. The objective of these best management practices (BMPs) is to reduce the pollution potential of agricultural waste. Although most ofthese policies and guidelines focus on the nutrient content of manure and its effects on the environment and human health, these management practices have been used as proxies for microorganism control as well. BMPs ensure that care is taken during the handling, transport, and application of waste so that human exposure to fecal contamination is minimized. Ginnivan et al. (1980) suggested that the bacteriological hazards associated with handling of manure occur at the animal housing facility, the land spreading stage, and the grazing areas of a farm operation. These stages are important because waste is being handled, spread and deposited in the environment where it has the ability to contaminate the soil, nearby water sources including wellheads, farm workers, and other animals. Municipal sewage treatment plants treat human wastes to decrease the number of contaminants before application onto land. But these treatment methods, with the exception of a few larger intensive livestock operations, are generally considered too expensive and unsuitable for typical farm operations, therefore policymakers and regulators have searched for simple methods of controlling contamination that can result from the use of manure (Strauch and Ballarini, 1994). There are three primary categories of manure management that affect its contamination potential: storage of wastes, land application of wastes, and cattle grazing, and all three have been well studied. Slurry and manure are normally spread on land after spending some time in a storage facility. Land application of manure must be timed appropriately to avoid rain, snow, and frozen soils, therefore manure must be stored until application is optimal. Manure or slurry can reside in a tank, lagoon, or field pile, and the method of storage and various treatments that may be implemented can alter the composition and microbial flora in the waste. Treatment of manure is not required in most jurisdictions and most agricultural operators do not treat manure prior to application, although studies do indicate that treatment can reduce the risk of pathogen
7 Best management practices (BMPs) are methods, measures, or practices designed to prevent or reduce pollution. They include structural and nonstructural controls as well as operation and maintenance procedures. The practices can be in varying combinations to prevent or control pollution from a particular non-point source.

exposure through application. There are various types of treatment and management methods including aerating slurry or manure, composting or anaerobic digestion of waste. There are also a number of management techniques which can reduce pathogen survival in manure including batch storage or continuous storage of waste. Composting of manure involves aerobic decomposition of manure at thermophilic temperatures (40-65°C) so that anaerobic, thermophilic bacteria can begin to produce and decompose the manure (Eghball, 1997; NRAES, 1992). Most commonly, composting is conducted in formed windrows of manure stacked outside. An initial mixing of the waste introduces air into the process and it is consumed by the microorganisms. The air supply must be replenished regularly to allow decomposition to continue. Air is supplied by turning the windrows and aerating pore spaces within the pile. When oxygen is supplied and decomposition is taking place, temperatures can reach 65°C (Eghball, 1997; NRAES, 1992). Because of the high temperatures, composting kills pathogenic microorganisms. The USEPA states that in order to successfully kill pathogens, temperatures must be maintained at 55°C or greater for 3 consecutive days. Jones (1980) stated that bacteria such as Salmonella could be killed in 5-37 days if temperatures were as high as 70°C. The end product of composted manure is a much easier material to handle than fresh manure because it has decreased in volume and weight and is drier. The compost is also odourless and contains very few if any pathogenic microorganisms, which is optimal for spreading onto cropland. Other advantages include a more stable form of organic nitrogen that is produced which is less susceptible to ammonia loss (NRAES, 1992). Disadvantages of the process include the time and money it requires. The process is time consuming and heavy equipment is needed to tum the windrows, cement pads are also needed to avoid leaching and runoff at the beginning of the process while the manure is wet. Composted manure also contains less than
~

the amount of nitrogen in fresh manure,

sometimes not enough nitrogen to satisfy plant requirements. It not only has fewer nutrients but nutrients are also released at a slower rate and may not become available to the crops until the second growing season after application (Eghball, 1997; NRAES, 1992). Another major disadvantage to composting is that operations that manage slurry, especially swine operations, must take extra steps in the composting process. A necessary porosity is required in the material to allow enough oxygen to penetrate and decomposition to occur, therefore slurry or

any other wet materials are inadequate. In order to compost slurry, other material must be added such as leaves, or bedding to add bulk and create pore spaces for oxygen entry. This increases the time and labour of the process as well as the amount of material to handle. There are many advantages and disadvantages to this process and agricultural operators must determine if it is an optimal process to conduct based on their own operations. Similarly, aeration of animal waste involves storage in which the manure is exposed to a continuous supply of oxygen to promote the growth of aerobic bacteria. Oxygen can be supplied mechanically if the storage site is small or enclosed, such as a tank, or it can be supplied naturally in a lagoon with a large exposed surface area (Fleming, 1986). There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. Mechanically aerated manure can be expensive; there are initial costs of the pump and then the on-going costs of keeping a steady air supply (Fleming, 1986). Lagoons on the other hand are less expensive but can become ineffective in the fall and winter seasons when the weather gets cold because cold temperatures slow down the process. Using lagoons to aerate manure in countries that have cold climates such as Canada can be ineffective, although they are still suitable for storage. Storage tanks obviously also cool in the winter months and the rate of bacterial growth decreases but not as much as
(

would occur in a lagoon. Aeration also controls odour and this is usually one of the primary reasons that agricultural operators utilize the process, as well as the reduction in nitrogen; generally aeration is not used for its microbial destruction capabilities but this is a secondary advantage. For example, Kudva et al. (1998) examined the effectiveness of aeration on the reduction of survival of E. coli in sheep and cattle manure. They found that in sheep manure, aeration decreased the survival of E. coli 0157:H7 from 21 months to 4 months. E. coli survival in cattle manure was also reduced to 47 days when aerated. In 1987, Munch et al. examined aeration's effects on a number of conditions including varying manure type and bacteria. E. coli survival was studied in cattle and pig slurry; 6-fold reductions were produced. Munch et al (1987) also examined the effects of aeration on S. typhimurillm and similar results were found. Thirdly, anaerobic digestion involves the breakdown of organic waste by bacteria in the absence of oxygen in a completely enclosed system. Microbial growth and biogas production occur naturally at high temperatures without dissolved oxygen (Lusk, 1997; AURI, 2001). The digestion rate can be altered in a treatment facility by increasing temperatures into the

mesophilic range (35-40°C) or the thennophilic range (40-6011C). The process is quicker at higher temperatures. The biogas, which is mostly methane, can be used to produce electricity or heat. Odours are controlled because of the microbial decomposition and, at such high temperatures, pathogens are greatly reduced. Kearney et a1. (1993) studied the survival of pathogens in anaerobically digested beef cattle slurry and found that E. coli reach T 90 levels in 1.5 days compared to greater than 29 days in nonnal storage. They also concluded that S.
typhimurium reached T90 levels in 1 day compared to 20 days in nonnal storage. Unlike

composting, digestion can take place with slurry or manure. The end product of anaerobically digested manure is a solid material that can be aged a bit longer into compost (Lusk, 1997). Digestate from slurry digestion is similar to what digested concentrated sewage sludge would be and can be directly spread on agricultural land (Lusk, 1997). This treatment process is more common in Europe than in North America because the process became popular after WWII when energy supplies were cut (Lusk, 1997), although interest in the technology is increasing in North America. Anaerobic lagoons may provide a similar end-product but digesters are smaller, more aesthetically pleasing and allow treatment year-round because they are not weather dependent. Other advantages include the decrease in odours, and pathogenic organisms, as well as the source of energy that is produced. Unlike composting, nutrients are conserved, about 90% of nutrients that enter the system are saved in the process (Lusk, 1997; AURI, 2001), and it is also easier to predict the nutrient content in this treated manure than fresh manure and therefore to apply it more appropriately onto land (ManureNet, 2003). These systems are efficient but they have a very high capital cost, up to $500,000 depending on the amount of manure that will be digested each year (Lusk, 1997). There is also an ongoing operating cost for the digester engine. These costs may be the reason that this treatment process is not utilized as readily in Canada.

2.3 Water Quality
It is the non-point source pollution due to runoff or subsurface transport of

contaminants associated with agricultural production that is the major threat to water quality. Other water quality concerns include seepage from field piles of manure, inadequately structured manure storage and livestock housing facilities and cattle access to water sources. Pesticides, nutrients, salt and sediments can also contaminate soil and lower the quality of water (Hooda et al. 2000; Conboy and Goss, 2001; Mapfumo et al. 2002). The phenomenon of

20

the concentration of the livestock industry, that is, fewer fanns but more livestock, has led to a large amount of manure being handled in one operation and, ifhandled improperly, can lead to water quality problems in surrounding water sources. Conboy and Goss (200 1) stated that rural drinking water contaminated by bacteria is more common than excessive nitrates and pesticides. Bacterial contamination has become more important in Canada and the United States during the last decade in which we have seen a number of major waterborne illness outbreaks, and since new regulatory regimes were enacted in 1985 (Johns, 2000). The concentrations of bacterial populations contained in manure are such that any input into water sources would result in levels greater than suggested in the Ontario water quality guidelines (King et al. 1994). Ontario bacterial water quality standards for drinking and recreational use are a and 100 organisms per lOamI for E. coli and fecal colifonns respectively. In a study conducted by Palmateer et al. (1989) it was concluded that there is potential for downstream fanns to affect water quality several kilometers from the point source of pollution. Studying E. coli the authors noted that the bacteria had traveled 17km downstream in 5 days. Gerba and McLeod (1976) and Palmateer et al. (1989) both showed that bacteria survive in water and in the sediment beds of water sources very well
(

because the sediments provide nutrients such as carbon, phosphorous, and nitrogen that support the survival of the bacteria. Water contamination is also common in agricultural land that has been tile-drained. It was assumed that bacteria could not be transported great distances through the soil matrix but studies suggest that bacterial transport through soil macropores 8 may playa significant role in the contamination oftile drains. Studies by Dean and Foran (1992) in south-western Ontario increased concerns with respect to direct transport of bacteria to tile drains from liquid manure applications. In their field studies, they observed that tile drains became contaminated with fecal colifonns shortly after application in 9 of 12 events monitored. They noted that tillage of the soils prior to manure application appeared to disrupt macropore continuity and decrease bacterial transport to the drains. In tile drains at a depth of 75cm, Culley and Phillips (1982) observed high fecal bacteria counts for several days following fall or winter application of liquid manure. And a study by Wall (1989) indicated that bacteria in liquid manure were the
Macropores are large continuous openings in field soils. They are readily visible and can extend for several meters both vertically and horizontally. Macropores can be formed by soil fauna, crop roots, cracks and fissures. (Beven and Germann, 1982)

primary source of tile water contamination. Rainfall following application also increased the bacterial concentrations. The effects that agricultural operations can have on the environment and in particular on water sources can lead to a risk to public health ifnot properly managed.

2.4 Manure-borne Pathogens and the Risk to Public Health
It is well documented that pathogenic bacteria can be transported in overland runoff or by subsurface infiltration in significant numbers to surface and ground water supplies. It is also well documented that these pathogens can survive in water supplies and cause illness in consumers. The prolonged survival of opportunistic pathogens introduced to water through the soil surface is especially of great concern to rural residents, the majority of whom rely on good quality potable water that is not treated (Sjogren, 1994). Approximately 29,000 waterborne disease cases (97% bacterial) were reported during 1981-1983 in the United States with a large portion of these cases traced to the consumption of untreated groundwater (Crane, 1986 in Sjogren, 1994). Yates and Yates (1989) showed that this trend has continued, and that over half of the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States are due to the consumption of contaminated groundwater, most of which occurred in non-municipal water systems. To be considered a waterborne disease outbreak, acute illness must affect at least two people and be epidemiologically associated with the ingestion of water (Macler and Merkle, 2000). In 1998 a 16-month old toddler living on an Ontario farm was hospitalized with an E. coli infection. E. coli was then found in 63% of the cattle on the fann. Since the child had had no direct contact with the cattle or their feces a water test was conducted. It was determined that the well water was the source of the E. coli. A hydrological examination of the farm yard and water well concluded that the site and design of the well were inadequate to protect against fecal contamination (Jackson et al. 1998). Not all waterborne disease outbreaks have been associated with untreated water. As noted earlier, it is well documented that Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts are resistant to chlorination in water treatment plants and need special attention to be controlled and that is not always given. The largest recently recorded Oyptosporidium outbreak occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. Cryptosporidium contaminated the water supply and infected nearly 400,000 consumers; half of the population. The WTP received its water from Lake Michigan and was equipped to control bacterial and viral infection but did not sufficiently kill off the Oyptosporidium oocysts (Robertson and Edberg, 1997). Shortly after,

in 1994, the Las Vegas water supply was contaminated with Cryptosporidium from the Colorado River. Widespread infection ensued in the population and 19 deaths were attributed to the outbreak. In Ontario, both Collingwood and Kitchener-Waterloo have had waterborne disease outbreaks due to Cryptosporidium, which resulted in illness but no deaths. One of the most serious and most closely watched waterborne disease outbreaks in Canada occurred in May 2000 in the small farming town of Walkerton, Ontario. E. coli

0157:H7 and Campylobacter were isolated in one of three municipal wells after several days
of heavy rain; the bacteria contaminated the water supply at high levels. It was determined that the E. coli 0157:H7 and Campylobacter in cow manure from an adjacent farmer's field had washed into the poorly planned and inadequately maintained well. The contaminated water resulted in widespread illness and led to 7 deaths. It must be noted that the farmer, whose fields the manure had traveled from, was following proper best management practices as established by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food. It was also discovered that the public utility manager, Stan Koebel, was not properly trained and was not adequately fulfilling his duties as water manager. The seriousness of the outbreak and the urge to lay blame for the tragedy by the public
(

led to an inquiry in which all issues involved in delivering safe drinking water were examined. Justice Dennis O'Connor led the inquiry and recommended a number of steps to improve water delivery in Walkerton and in all of Ontario. It was noted that proper chlorination would have prevented the tragedy and that Stan Koebel's failure to notify authorities of the high levels of contamination in the municipal well increased the spread of the tragedy. Justice O'Connor also noted that government cutbacks at the Ontario Ministry of the Environment resulted in resources that had been spread too thin and therefore som,e water utilities, such as Walkerton's, were not given proper attention. O'Connor also recommended that all local health units prepare and practice emergency procedures so that all are prepared to deal with a tragedy such as this. Walkerton's public health officials were unprepared and overwhelmed which resulted in an advisory that was insufficient and did not reflect the seriousness of the situation. Some of Justice O'Connor's recommendations have been implemented including the drafting of a Safe Drinking Water Act for Ontario, and a Nutrient Management Act has been enacted by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food and the Ontario Ministry of Environment.

Another outbreak in Canada that led to an inquiry occurred in April 2001 in the city of North Battleford, Saskatchewan. In this incident, Cryptosporidium was the causative organism in the community-wide outbreak of gastroenteritis and led to three deaths. The City of North Battleford's surface water treatment plant is equipped with a filter unit designed to catch this parasite but it was concluded that the filter was most likely not working at the time of the outbreak. It is also important to note that the province had abandoned its inspection program of WTPs in 1993 and instead monitored bacteriological quality. The last time this WTP had been monitored was in 1991. The recommendations of the inquiry have resulted in a new provincewide water strategy in Saskatchewan. The strategy focuses on water quality standards, and improving WTP delivery as well as watershed protection. A new Watershed Authority has been created that will balance the competing land and water uses that impact water quality in various watersheds. Atwill (1995) suggested that public health officials should look for new ways to control the parasite in drinking water and suggested that the optimal strategy would be watershed protection (source protection) and land-use restrictions regarding the location and management oflivestock operations within those watersheds. Watershed protection is now becoming an important means of protecting water supplies from contamination as provinces and municipalities have seen that treatment alone has not controlled contamination.

(

2.5 Source Water Protection
The general principle of source protection is to protect water sources from contamination from all land and water uses, and to safeguard environmental and human health and ensure a safe drinking water supply. Robertson and Edberg (1997) broke down the general principle of source water protection into four basic principles: I) to minimize existing or potential sources of contamination within a watershed or hydraulic capture zone of a well or spring, 2) to protect the water collection system, 3) to minimize the mobility or prevalence of contaminants within the zone, and 4) to monitor for warning signs of contamination. Source protection not only includes whole watershed zones but also capture zones around springs and wells or the increased protection of water collection systems such as a pump-house. Basic strategies used in source protection may include: regulation or voluntary instruments (Johns, 2000), prohibiting land uses with a serious potential to contaminate groundwater, setting conditions under which activities may be permitted through the use of design standards

(Yanggen and Born, 1990), and utilizing minimum separation distances between land uses and water sources. Minimizing potential sources of pollution may include limiting the number of potential water-contaminating land uses within a watershed. For example, an assessment may be conducted to determine a water source's ability to assimilate the amount of contaminants that enter it on a regular basis. Different watersheds would be assessed to handle differing amounts of inputs due to the size of the water-body, its length, or its current condition. Land use restrictions may include a maximum number oflivestock per square kilometer of grassland adjacent to the water or the number of square kilometers of cropped land adjacent to the water or number of industrial sites within the watershed. This principle may be the most difficult to complete, especially in densely populated watersheds, predominantly agricultural watersheds, or any watershed that has already been largely developed. This principle can work well in and protect those watersheds that have yet to be developed. Secondly, the protection of water collection systems does not need to include the whole watershed but zones or protected areas surrounding municipal wellheads that focus more on groundwater protection. This principle can include physical barriers such as fencing around pump-houses, berms to minimize flooding or runoff from entering the vicinity and even resoiling of the land surrounding a wellhead to further protect it from leaching contaminants. Wellhead protection districts or zones are also being more commonly used as a means of protection, and involve regulating the existing recharge area and even future municipal wells or clusters of private wells (Yanggen and Born, 1990). A number of zones can be created around the water supply; all with increasingly strict land uses as the zone approaches the source. Land use regulations based on zoning were first developed to prevent conflicts between incompatible land uses in the urban setting and have now been applied to rural areas to protect sensitive lands (Yanggen and Born, 1990). For example, New Brunswick has recently enacted the Wellfield Protected Areas Designation Order. This program involves a large designated protected area that is divided into three smaller zones; Zones A, B, and C. The restrictions within the zones are based on the persistence of contaminants in the environment, the different rates that they can move within the area and in the soil type found there, as well as the health risks posed by them. Zone A is the zone immediately surrounding the municipal wellhead and is the most restrictive. Within

this zone septic tanks, sewer lines, petroleum products, pesticides and other similar chemicals are restricted or severely controlled. Land application and transport of manure, and the development of new septic tanks are prohibited in this zone. Zone B surrounds Zone A. In this zone bacterial risk is greatly reduced because of the increased distance from the wellhead, but the use of chemical pollutants is still very restricted. Zone C surrounds both Zones A and B and again is less stringent in its land restrictions because of the increased distance to the municipal wellhead and therefore the increased time of travel for contaminants. The Department of Natural Resources in Wisconsin also enacted a Wellhead Protection Program (WHPP) in 1993. A wellhead protection plan must be developed and approved for every municipal well that has been proposed since May 1S\ 1992. Requirements of the plan include identifYing the recharge area of the well, identifYing the existing potential sources of contamination within a Y2 mile radius of the well, the establishment of a protection area based on a hydrological study, a public education program, a water conservation program and lastly, a contingency plan for the protection of the supply under unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances. Wellheads that were proposed and built before the May 1S\ 1992 deadline were not required to have a WHPP put into place but it was recommended by the Department. Similarly in Germany, it is common practice to define three protection zones around water catchment pumps to prevent fecal pollution of aquifers (Rothmaier, 1997). Thirdly, source protection should work to minimize the mobility and prevalence of contaminants within the zone through measures such as restricted rates of application of chemical pesticides and fertilizers onto land or through the use of minimum separation distances between the well and any land application of potential contaminants. These measures are commonly included in Best Management Practices (BMPs) or regulations for agricultural operators in the area. Logan (1990) stated that BMPs were specifically developed to deal with non-point source pollution problems such as the transport of contaminants into surface and ground water sources. Minimum separation distances, for instance, are based on the assumption that pollutants will not contaminate a water source because of the filtration that takes place in soil between the source and the wellhead (Macler and Merkle, 2000). In the new Nutrient Management Act in Ontario, there is a minimum separation distance of a two-year time of travel required between the site ofland application of manure and a municipal water well. This intends to minimize the mobility and prevalence of fecal contaminants by requiring

that they are spread a great enough distance, that if they were able to be transported in the soil matrix it would take approximately 2 years to reach the underground aquifer. It is assumed that within those two years, microbiological organisms would die or the number of those viable would be less than the water quality standards of Ontario and therefore too few to cause a risk of consumption. Even though many farm operators abide by minimum separation distances, there have been cases of bacterial contamination of water supplies. Some of the guidelines may therefore be too broad for risk-free application on all soil types and topographies (Conboy and Goss, 200 I). There is not a single safe setback distance that would be risk-free for all situations; which is the problem with guidelines that set homogenous regulations. In some cases, a 30m distance may not pose a threat to an aquifer, whereas in other cases a lkm separation may be needed to protect the source. The United States EPA has been reviewing a strategy for the protection of water wells from microbial contamination that involves calculating minimum separation distances based on virus mobility in the subsurface environment. The EPA assumes that if the distance is great enough to protect against virus contamination, it will also protect against less mobile contaminants such as bacteria, and protozoan parasites (Robertson and Edberg, 1997). Monitoring for signs of contamination is not adequate in the protection of health alone because it is a reactive measure (Macler and Merkle, 2000) but combined with the previous proactive measures, monitoring can be used as a means of determining whether contamination has occurred and can signal contingency plans or alerts. There are a number of reasons why microbiological monitoring is not used on its own including: the fact that pathogenic organisms are difficult to detect and sample volumes must be large to enable detection, the detection of pathogens does not always translate into infectivity and a threat to consumers, many water labs are not equipped to monitor for all pathogens or have the resources to and lastly, definitive results can take days or weeks in a laboratory which would be too long to make timely public health decisions (Allen et al. 2000). Instead indicator organisms are

monitored for signs of fecal contamination since monitoring for specific organisms is too costly and lengthy. There has been debate over which indicator organisms are most optimal to use. Health Canada is currently rewriting its monitoring guidelines for municipal systems and is in

27

discussion with experts as to which should be used. Commonly used indicator organisms include: total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC), fecal streptococci (FS), and E coli. Edberg et al. (2000) state that there are characteristics that an indicator organism must possess to properly assess water quality, these include: being present whenever pathogens are present, it must occur in greater numbers than pathogens so that it can be easily detected, it must be hardy enough to survive the amount of time needed to be detected and it must be distributed throughout the water sample so that it can be found in random tests. Firstly, FS are not good indicators of drinking water contamination because they do not offer much information except that fecal contamination of a water source has occurred relatively recently. FS die off rather quickly compared to TC that are less sensitive than viruses and protozoan cysts to environmental stressors (Conboy and Goss, 2001). Although TC are discharged in high numbers in both human and animal feces, they are not all of fecal origin. FC bacteria are better indicators that human health may be compromised (Conboy and Goss, 2001), because their presence in water supplies indicate the presence of fecal contamination from warm-blooded animals and include E coli and Kleibsiella pneumonae. Unfortunately these bacteria are less resistant than other pathogens, they have been detected in pristine water sources, and they may survive for extended periods. Although FC indicate fecal contamination, they do not allow determination of the source of contamination, animal or human. Instead, E coli has been relied on as an indicator organism. Edberg et al. (2000) and Conboy and Goss (2001) both believe that E coli is the optimal indicator for drinking water contamination because it best satisfies the criteria. E. coli is present in high numbers in the feces of all mammals, methods to detect it are inexpensive and simple, and it survives in a number of water sources under various pressures. Critics of using E. coli as an indicator organism state that the detection of E coli in water samples does not necessarily specify a risk to drinking water because most strains of E. coli are not pathogenic. A study recently published in the Applied and Environmental Microbiology Journal suggests that Salmonella would be the best indicator because a number of studies have shown that it survives longer in a variety of water environments than Ecoli (Winfield and Groisman, 2003). This debate will likely continue. Source protection is also a response to a fairly new land use issue: exurban sprawl 9 or the growth of 'boomburgs' (Nelson and Sanchez, 2002; Lang and Simmons, 2002). The

exurban landscape grew faster than the urban, suburban, or rural landscapes during the 1990s in the United States (Nelson and Sanchez, 2002). This trend was also found in Canada. The rural fann population is continually becoming a smaller component of the rural population. For example, between 1986 and 1991 there were 12, 455 fewer fann residents in Ontario but 211,233 more rural residents (Caldwell, 1998). This increase was not just in small clusters of homes in the rural area but there was significant growth in the number of non-agricultural rural residents who live on properties intenningled with fann properties. As residentiallandowners and agricultural operators move closer, what were previously separate land uses have become intertwined and the potential for conflict has increased. Abdalla et al. (1996) state that the shrinking of the rural-urban interface has threatened the viability of fanning. Well-planned source protection strategies are needed so both agricultural operators and other rural residents can avoid conflict by reducing problems and the risk of contamination by clearly defining land use restrictions and allowances. Source protection programs reduce the costs of ground and surface water contamination, not only monetarily but also by reducing the cost of conflict and division within a community as well as mitigating health costs of potential illnesses that are avoided by ensuring safe water supplies.

Chapter Three: Nutrient Management Regulations
3.1 Review of Existing Nutrient Management Policies and Strategies
A variety of strategies and policies were reviewed including Acts that discuss entire agricultural operations, and some that have a more narrow focus and deal specifically with managing agricultural waste. The areas of study have been broken down into four components: Canada, the United States, Other Countries and Ontario's new Nutrient Management Act (2002) which is reviewed individually. Appendix 3.1 summarizes the policies and strategies that have been reviewed in Canada, including the purpose of each. Appendices 3.2 and 3.3 summarize the policies and strategies reviewed in the United States and other countries, respecti vel y. The method of investigation for this chapter was to choose jurisdictions in Canada, the United States, and other countries that have dealt with agricultural nutrient management by creating policies or guidelines. Most jurisdictions in Canada have been reviewed. Those that are not reviewed include Newfoundland, the Yukon Territory, and Nunavut. These jurisdictions were searched but no policies relevant to this report were found, therefore they are not included. A variety of jurisdictions were reviewed in the United States. States were chosen based on the availability of the information, and the inclusion of issues that are similar to the ones focused on in Canada. The other countries that were reviewed include England, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. Again, these countries were chosen based on the amount of information that was available, along with the relative similarity to those issues that are covered in Canada. Most of the jurisdictions focus their nutrient management initiatives on 3 key areas, these are: 1. Nutrient management plans/Waste management plans, 2. Storage of nutrients and, 3. Land application of nutrients The focus was on these key areas when reviewing the various nutrient management initiatives. However, the specific regulations and practices adopted by each jurisdiction to deal with these key issues vary throughout the nutrient management policies and acts, differentiating them from each other. For example, in the case of the storage of nutrients there

are a number of practices that have been adopted to minimize the potential of nutrient contamination including; facility construction requirements, minimum capacity requirements, and minimum separation distances. The review of the nutrient management acts and policies shows that there is a wide variety in the specific regulations and that consistency among policies is not high. Tables 1,2 and 3 provide a general outline of the policies and guidelines that have been reviewed within Canada, the United States and other countries, respectively. Many of the policies involve creating nutrient or waste management plans, although some do not, many policies involve storage capacities, land application requirements during specific times of the year and on land with certain topographical characteristics.

3.1.1 Nutrient Management Plans/Waste Management Plans
Although pathogens and nutrients are natural components of an ecosystem, human development, industrialization, agricultural activity, and the population of watersheds, all increase the loading of these materials into the water. Where increased loadings occur, pathogens and nutrients exist in such high concentrations that they effectively become contaminants that can cause significant water quality problems. Increased loadings can occur when manure and fertilizers are applied to land without consideration of the amount being distributed. These increased loadings have created a policy response by government. Policies are created first, before nutrient management plans, in an attempt by governments to respond to an ungoverned situation that poses a threat to health, and within the policies nutrient management plans are used as instruments to protect water quality through nutrient calculation. A nutrient management plan (NMP) is a process to match the nutrients available in manure and commercial fertilizer to nutrients required by the crop, thereby preventing the buildup of nutrients in soils but at the same time improving crop yield. A sound NMP identifies manure application rates that meet crop nutrient needs, termed the agronomic rate, therefore minimizing the need to use additional fertilizers. Application of manure at agronomic

33

rates minimizes the potential for nutrients to move out of the crops' root zone and maximizes the manure's nutrient value to the landowner. Well-designed plans will also account for local and on-site conditions that could affect the fate of manure once it is field-applied, such as soil type, topography and weather patterns. Potential environmental impacts are minimized through the use of adjusted application rates and management practices that are appropriate for the given crop and local conditions. Nutrient management acts and policies set the stage for developing nutrient management plans; these plans place the responsibility for applying and controlling nutrients on individual fann operators. A review of agricultural policies and drinking water protection policies across the globe shows that most jurisdictions have required, or strongly recommended, that nutrient management plans (NMP), also known as waste management plans (WMP), be filed by agricultural operators.

3.1.1.1 Canadian Nutrient Management Plans/Waste Management Plans
The North West Territory is the only jurisdiction reviewed that did not have a strategy similar to a NMP in place. British Columbia's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (BCMAFF) is the only agriculture ministry to not require or explain how to complete a NMP. The British Columbia Agricultural Waste Control Regulation (1992) does state that waste must not be applied to land at rates that exceed the amount required for crop growth but this is a broad requirement that lacks any other specifics to guide operators. The NMP Guide for British Columbia suggests what should be included in a plan but gives no instruction or further information on how to determine rates of application, nutrient requirements, or any other calculation that would be needed. The lack of a required NMP may change quickly when the British Columbia Drinking Water Protection Act is enforced lO · The Be Drinking Water Protection Act allows the Health Services minister to designate an area for the purpose of developing a drinking water protection plan (DWPP) if the minister considers that a plan will assist in addressing or preventing threats to drinking water. These threats can include an overload of nutrients from agricultural operations or municipal sewage systems. Once an area has been designated, nutrient loadings will be monitored, therefore, some agricultural operators may eventually have

10 The Be Drinking Water Protection Act passed its third reading on Aprilll!h 2001; it has received Royal Assent but is not yet enforced.

34

to develop a NMP in order that these nutrients can be calculated into the overall NMP for the designated area. The province of Manitoba is similar to British Columbia in that the Livestock Manure and Mortalities Management Regulation (1998) requires operators that house more than 400 animal units to apply livestock manure to land in accordance with a NMP that has been registered. But no information is given regarding what is required in order to approve the NMP. Again, this requirement may be given higher priority when Manitoba's proposed Nutrient Management Strategy for Surface Water (2002) is implemented. This strategy acts in a similar fashion to BC's Drinking Water Protection Plan in that regional boundaries will be defined within which each area within a set of boundaries will develop its own drinking water protection plan. These plans will depend on each region's current nutrient status and land uses, therefore in areas of high nutrient release, more stringent plans may come into effect that will pertain to all industries that handle, produce or transport materials that contain nutrients, including agricultural operations. The Alberta Agricultural Operations Practices Act (200 I) and the Quebec Regulation Respecting Agricultural Operations (2002) have similar NMP requirements. Both require a comprehensive NMP for the application of livestock manure on agricultural soil, although Alberta's NMP is only required if requested by Natural Resources Conservation Board (NRCB) inspectors. In preparing a NMP for the NRCB in Alberta, operators must have their soil tested every three years to determine extractable nitrogen and phosphate levels, and soil salinity and texture. Nitrogen is used as the determining nutrient and specified nitrate-nitrogen levels are not to be exceeded. The NMP is comprehensive in that it takes into account soil type, manure type, livestock type, and number of livestock. The NMP produces a final land-based requirement for a certain type of crop based on the soil type, livestock type and manure type of each individual farm. Quebec's Regulation and NMP requirement goes one step further and requires a plan for all fertilizing substances, including bought fertilizers and composts, not only animal manure. These plans must be approved by a government agronomist and must include information such as: amount applied of each fertilizing substance on each parcel of land, method of spreading, and the duration and dates of spreading. Spreading techniques and timing of application can alter the amount of nutrients that are available to crops therefore this information is important in NMP calculations.

35

The nutrient management plans discussed above only require plans for the calculation of the nutrient levels in soils and manure. Both New Brunswick and Saskatchewan require not only NMP for the application of nutrients on land but also waste management plans that describe storage, transport and the management of dead animals. These practices are also important in nutrient management because, ifnot carried out properly, they can result in nutrient and pathogen contamination. New Brunswick Regulation 99-32 under the Livestock Operations Act (1999) requires a NMP and a manure system description before renewal of or approval of a Livestock Operators License will be granted. Appendix 3.4 lists the complete requirements for both the plan and the description. The Saskatchewan Agricultural Operations Act (1995) requires much the same as New Brunswick, a waste storage plan, waste management plan for land utilization, and a waste management plan for dead animal management, although these plans are only required of intensive livestock operators II.Waste storage plans involve specific construction requirements for various types of storage facilities such as an earthen storage area, holding pond, and liquid manure storage tank. The land utilization waste management plans must provide details on the annual volume of manure produced, the estimated amount of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium in the manure, as well as manure type, application type, expected crop nutrient requirements, land area available and any plans for manure other than land utilization. Dead animals also contain nutrients and pathogens and therefore must be carefully discarded; these plans must calculate the expected animal deaths per year and discuss the method of disposal chosen. Nova Scotia has developed a relatively comprehensive guideline for the completion of NMP through its Canada-Nova Scotia Agreement on the Agriculture Component of the Green Plan (1994). There are two documents required including a nutrient management job sheet that describes the allocation of manure resources on the participating farm on a field-by-field basis, and a report summarizing annual manure production and use and the overall farm manure surplus or deficit. Manure samples must be taken to determine the macronutrients, micronutrients, and secondary nutrients that are available for plant take-up. These requirements deal strictly with manure utilization and not storage or transport.
II Intensive Livestock Operators require management plans when their operation: a) contains an earthen manure storage area or lagoon; b) involves the rearing, confinement or feeding of 300 or more animal units for more than 10 days in any 30-day period; or c) subject to b), involves the rearing, confinement or feeding of more than 20 animal units but less than 300 units, for more than 10 days in any 30-day period, and any part of which is within 300m of surface water or 30m of a domestic well not controlled by the person who operates the ILO.

3.1.1.2 United States Nutrient Management Plans/Waste Management Plans
All jurisdictions reviewed require a form of nutrient management plan. Washington, Wisconsin and Nebraska all have Nutrient or Waste Management Acts that require NMPs and separate guidelines or rules for specific regulations. Most management plans in these jurisdictions require the same information; calculations of nutrient or manure production levels and crop requirements, collection, storage and treatment methods, land application rates, methods and timing. Soil erosion must also be addressed in most jurisdictions, although in Wisconsin's Runoff Management Rules (2002), all cropped fields must meet a Tolerable Soil Erosion Rate l2 and these calculations must be included in the plan. Michigan on the other hand, addresses erosion by restricting livestock from waterways in controlled access areas and requires stream bank management to reduce sediment accumulation in waterways. Based on risk of application calculated in the Nebraska Livestock Waste Management Act (1998), operators my be required to test groundwater biannually to determine nutrient levels and therefore determine if management practices are effective at keeping nutrients out of the water supply. Considering this is one ofthe overall goals of most of the Acts being reviewed, this proactive requirement should be utilized by more jurisdictions, especially since only nutrient management plans in Washington and Texas are subject to inspection programs. This requirement would allow operators to detect contamination and track levels over the season and over the years, results would also help to determine whether their plans should be revised for improvement. The inspection program in Washington tracks nitrogen levels in groundwater, when nitrogen has been identified on an operation, an end-of-season nitrate-N soil sample and analysis must be completed. This also must be completed.on operations where combined precipitation and irrigation are greater than 25 inches (63.5 centimeters). Otherwise, soil tests in Washington must be taken every 3 years for perennial crops and annually for annual crops. In Delaware, two types of plans are required. Those operations that contain animals must develop an Animal Waste Plan, and those operations that only apply nutrients to land, such as cash-cropping operations, must develop Nutrient Management Plans.

production calculations, nutrient calculations, crop requirements, collection, storage and transfer methods, and utilization plans for manure with respect to each field within the operation. Maine's nutrient management plans do not require information regarding operations; instead the plans focus strictly on crop requirements and nutrient calculations during land application. This NMP does not require information such as storage, transfer or treatment methods but simply the contents of the waste, how and where it will be applied. Maine's plans must also include soil erosion provisions.

3.1.1.3 Other Nutrient Management Plans/Waste Management Plans
Both Finland's Decree on the Restriction of Discharge of Nitrate from Agriculture into Waters (2000) and Scotland's Control of Pollution Regulations for Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil (200 I) do not address or require nutrient or waste management plans. On the other hand, nutrient management plans are the key to the Netherlands Manure and Fertilizer Policy (1999). The Dutch landscape is stressed due to the intensity oflivestock production in the country and eutrophication is a serious problem in its waters, therefore the Netherlands Manure and Fertilizer Policy (1999) is largely based on the Minerals Accounting System (MINAS) (Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, 2001). This system is based on the amount of phosphate and nitrate that each agricultural operation receives and applies throughout the season. Agricultural operators work to equalize the amount of inputs and outputs of nutrients, the surplus of nutrients used is the difference. Therefore the volume of manure spread on the land should be equal to the uptake requirements of the crops. If farmers have a greater amount of manure than they can handle, they must find surplus land or reduce the number oflivestock they house. All inputs and outputs must be recorded. Some mineral losses are allowed, but if larger surpluses are accrued, then operators are fined based on the extent ofthe surplus. All operations are accounted for in this system including storage, transport, treatment and land application. Contingency plans are required for the next growing season and must be followed if levies have been charged. In the England Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Production of Water (1998), waste management plans (WMP) are also required. One of the objectives of these WMP is to reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens to livestock. This Code is one of the few policies reviewed that addresses pathogens and their control. These plans must include categorizing

land areas based on their risk of water pollution and matching land area to the amount of nutrients in the wastes. These plans must also address storage and handling. Operators must have contingency plans in place including where to obtain needed emergency equipment if it is discovered that contamination has occurred. Farm waste management plans (FWMP) in the Scotland Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural Activity policy (1997) involve all aspects of manure handling to establish the quantities of waste produced and safe methods 13 of collection, transport, storage, treatment and land application. A FWMP must include four steps: identifying the waste production schedule, preparing a land availability schedule, matching the waste production to land availability and calculating the amount of storage required. Identifying the production schedule involves the type, quantity, and nutrient content of the wastes produced in an operation. The land availability schedule involves calculations based on type of crops, land suitability, and proximity of watercourses, sensitive habitats and other sensitive features. A FWMP must include any imported or exported farm waste.

3.1.1.4 Nutrient Management Plans/Waste Management Plans Conclusions
Based on the review of the requirements of nutrient management plans, the primary objective of nutrient management plans is to calculate nutrient loadings onto agricultural land. Some nutrient management plans simply require land application calculations whereas others require handling and storage plans as well. Overall, of the jurisdictions that require NMPs, only one addresses the issue of pathogens. Herd infection rates, shedding rates and pathogen loads in waste once applied to land are nearly impossible to calculate and therefore it is ineffective to attempt to address pathogens in this manner. However, pathogens could be addressed in handling and storage plans as they are in England's Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Production of Water (1998). This policy addresses pathogens with respect to manure handling to avoid the infection of livestock herds. The waste management plan required under the Code is therefore the most restrictive and effective with respect to pathogen control. The nutrient management plans within the other policies fail to address pathogens and this could lead to inadequately controlled pathogens and contamination by focusing solely on nitrogen and phosphorus loads.

3.1.2 Storage of Manure A properly designed manure handling system is convenient for the operator, maintains the health and safety of humans and animals, conserves nutrients in manure while allowing pathogen die-off, minimizes handling costs and protects the environment (Manure Management Task Group, 1991). Manure storage systems are functionally similar but there is no ultimately optimal system in practice because storage systems largely depend on the type of manure that is used: solid, semi-solid, or liquid, and the operations on that farm. The tables in Appendices 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 show the detailed information about storage regulations in each jurisdiction for Canada, United States and the other countries, respectively. 3.1.2.1 Storage in Canada Both the British Columbia Agricultural Waste Control Regulations (1992) and the Alberta Agricultural Operations Practices Act (200 I) do not require the approval of nutrient or waste management plans. However, they do require the largest amount of minimum capacity from storage facilities in Canada: 270 days. In British Columbia, this may be due to the wet climate of the province and to ensure that manure can be stored until the saturated soil conditions that are found in wet climates are dissipated. When it comes to minimum separation distances, the two policies differ greatly. In the case of the BC Agricultural Waste Control Regulations (1992), all storage types, with the exception of field storage, have minimum separation distances (MSDs) of 15m to any watercourse and 30m to any wellhead or water source for domestic use. Whereas the Alberta Operations Practices Act (2001), the MSDs are much greater, there is a required base separation of 30m from a watercourse, 100m from a wellhead, and 150m from the nearest residence. The BC Waste Control Regulations (1992) allow field storage for two weeks or up to nine months if the field pile is greater than 30m from any watercourse. The field pile and watercourse must also be separated by a berm that creates protection of the water body. These regulations are the only regulations in the country to mention the use of under-pen storage, a fairly new type of storage management for solid manure. These slatted flooring systems are normally used for liquid manure and are particularly prevalent for hog finishing barns, beef finishing barns, and some dairy farms (Mussell, 2002). Solid manure versions of these are being developed for hogs in which straw is used to compost the manure. The regulations also state that certain areas of the province that receive a greater amount of rainfall, such as the

Fraser Valley and Vancouver Island, need to cover field-stored manure piles to prevent runoff. The Alberta Agricultural Operations Act (2001) also takes into account some non-nonnal conditions: the construction of storage facilities must take into account the flooding that can occur in a 1:25 year flood. And lastly, a catch basin must have a storage capacity that can accommodate at least one day maximum of rain that has a 1:30 year probability as calculated based on the county average. The Saskatchewan Agricultural Operations Act (1995) requires a very detailed storage plan that must include specific details that follow normally accepted agricultural practices that are in the Saskatchewan Livestock Operations Guidelines (200 I). No other requirements are stated in the regulations but a ministry official must approve all plans. For more clarity, the plan requirements should accompany the document requiring a plan to be written. Instead only guidelines are found in the Saskatchewan Livestock Operations Guidelines document: recommendations are given on construction and type of storage that should be utilized for both liquid and solid manure. There is a required minimum storage capacity of six months, but 360 days is recommended. Manitoba's Livestock Manure and Mortalities Management Regulation (1998) also requires a storage plan but includes the specific regulations that plans must contain. Operators of a facility that houses more than 400 animal units must have a plan registered with the director ofthe ministry. Moreover, in the opinion of the director, any facility with less than 400 animal units may also require a plan if it is thought that the operation is in jeopardy of contaminating nearby water bodies or wellheads. This regulation is consistent in its minimum setback distances; all types of storage facilities must be sited at least 100m away from any water-body or well. This includes field storage of solid manure. Manitoba's regulators may have taken a different approach to the regulations than any of the other provinces by keeping MSDs the same and creating construction restrictions based on soil type at that location. There is also a restriction in siting a storage facility within the boundaries of the 100-year flood plain elevation. The Quebec Regulations Respecting Agricultural Operations (2002) have differing minimum setback distances for varying types of storage facilities. Constructed watertight facilities have less stringent MSDs than field storage piles that should remain at a greater distance because of the lack of constraints that could contain the manure from running off into

Illil l I

nearby watercourses. These regulations have a minimum capacity requirement of 180 days in order to have enough storage capacity to make it through the winter months. In examining the guidelines and regulations in New Brunswick, the minimum separation distances in the guidelines were much more rigorous than the regulations. In the New Brunswick Livestock Operations Act Regulation 99-32 (1999), operators must abide by a MSD formula when siting storage facilities. The formula takes into account the manure type, livestock type, and manure storage type l4 · Although this formula gives the impression that it is scientifically calculated, the livestock factor appears to take into account the odour strength of the type of manure as most important rather than the amount of manure that that type of livestock would produce on average. The 'all other livestock' category must include dairy and beef cows and in terms of abundance of manure and prevalence of pathogens, this type of manure should be a larger factor in the equation than poultry and swine manure. The minimum capacity requirement in Regulation 99-32 is 210 days after November 1st, therefore allowing operators to be able to store manure through the winter so that winter application is unnecessary. The minimum separation distances (MSD) calculated in the New Brunswick Manure Management Guidelines l5 are much more detailed than the MSD formula in Regulation 99-32. This formula is a function of four factors: base distance as a function of animal units, an expansion factor, a manure system factor, and livestock type factor. Although this formula is more detailed, it again seems to be focused on odour rather than environmental protection. This appears to be the case because watercourses, property lines, and highways have constant separation distances of 100m, 20m and 20m respectively, whereas the formula only applies to such areas as neighbouring dwellings, residences, and commercially or recreationally zoned areas. Similarly, there is a storage capacity requirement of 210 days after November 1Sl. Nova Scotia's manure management requirements are simply guidelines but recommend a very detailed nutrient management plan that must be approved by an officer. The Nova Scotia Animal Manure and Use Guidelines (1991) require that operators obtain a manure handling system design from the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture and Marketing Extension. The system plan incorporates farm resource considerations including economics,

manpower, equipment, existing structures, animal populations, site characteristics and storage capacity. The guidelines do require a base distance between storage facilities and water bodies or wells of 100m. The minimum storage capacity is similar to most other provinces at seven months. Hog operators can look to more specific guidelines for the management of their manure. The MSDs from storage facilities are found in Appendix 3.10, and it is clear that these minimum separation distances are for the purpose of odour control. Again, watercourse and wellhead MSDs remain constant at 100m regardless of the size of operation but MSDs increase with size of operation for off-farm dwellings and non-farm developments. The minimum storage capacity is the same at 210 days. Prince Edward Island also relies on guidelines to manage manure across the province but is very detailed in its recommendations due to the fact that 100% of PEl drinking water supplies come from ground water (Black, 2002). It is also a rural agricultural province but with very little land base therefore the proper management of manure is essential. Minimum separation distances for the siting of manure storage facilities to nearby wells are fundamental to the guidelines and take into account county specific topography and hydrogeology concerns. The guidelines use a soil map survey and address geographical concerns such as shallow bedrock, and seasonally high water tables. These concerns are weighed and given a multiplication factor such as 1.5 or 2 depending on their severity and are then multiplied by the base distance of90m. Some counties in the province do not have siting concerns, while other counties must be investigated on a site specific basis. These regulations are the only ones reviewed that closely resemble watershed source protection areas, in which each county is unique. Vegetated filter strips placed between storage facilities and watercourses are also highly recommended. Vegetated filter strips are more effective in retarding the movement of nutrients rather than pathogens. Because of the small size of pathogenic organisms these strips are not as effective in catching the pathogens and blocking them from entering into bodies of water (Domer, 2002). Again, the recommended minimum storage capacity in a constructed facility is 210 days from November 1st. If operators are utilizing solid manure and field storage is an option, then 60 days accumulation is sufficient. One of the key recommendations in the North West Territory Guidelines for Agricultural Waste (1999) is the holding capacity of manure storage facilities. Due to the longer winter season and in order to avoid spreading on frozen or snow-covered ground, these

guidelines have one of the longest requirements at 240 days. The minimum setback distance for siting a manure storage facility must be 100m to both watercourses and wells. The separation distances of storage facilities from populations are a function of the human population and the number of animal units on the operation 16. The distances are extended if the operation utilizes an open air liquid manure storage facility.

3.1.2.2 Storage in United States

Manure storage facilities in the United States are regulated in the same manner as in Canada, with construction requirements, minimum separation distances from sensitive areas and storage capacity requirements. In Maine, under the Nutrient Management Law and Nutrient Management Rules (1998), the location of storage facilities is very site specific and the only absolute MSD is that they must be sited at least 30.48m from any domestic wells. Washington and Iowa are the only states that address separation distances of storage facilities to watercourses; this is very different from the policies in Canada, where most require a MSD to a watercourse. Washington requires a MSD of91.44m, whereas Iowa distinguishes between major and minor watercourses with separation distances of 152.4m and 60.92m, respectively. Many jurisdictions in the United States distinguish between private and public wells, which again is different than most of the Canadian policies reviewed. Minimum separation distances are always greater for public wells where, if contamination occurred, a greater number of people would be exposed. Both Minnesota and Nebraska require 304.8m between a public well and a constructed storage facility and only 30.48m from a private well. Iowa on the other hand, distinguishes the differences in the construction of the wells. A deep well is defined as one that is located and constructed so that there is a low-permeability layer of soil at least 1.5m thick surrounding it that extends as deep as 7m, and a shallow well is not surrounded by this continuous layer. A formed storage facility must be sited at least 30.48m from a deep well and 60.96m from a shallow well. Other separation distances to private and public wells can be found in Appendix 3.12. Appendix 3.12 also shows MSDs of storage structures to residences, businesses and public use areas. These MSDs are based on the type of structure, whether covered, confined, or earthen, and the type and weight capacity of the
16

livestock on that operation. These factors suggest that the MSDs are calculated based on odour control and not on risk of contamination. Missouri's Guide to Animal Feeding Operations (1999) also separates storage facilities from residential areas based on the number of livestock housed, as numbers increase so does the MSD. Other siting requirements found in these policies include location of facility above the seasonal high water level of at least 1.22m in both Missouri and Nebraska. Distance to bedrock is only addressed in Iowa's Chapter 65 (1999) with respect to earthen storage structures and requires a distance of 3m. Iowa is the only state that has greater MSDs to sensitive areas for earthen storage facilities than constructed facilities, see Appendix 3.12. Iowa also requires a greater storage capacity at 420 days. Capacity requirements for constructed storage facilities are fairly consistent throughout these regulations at 180 days. Wisconsin's Animal Feeding Operations Rules (2002) do not specify capacity; capacity must be approved in the Manure Management Plan and is specific to each operation. Due to its exposure to the elements and greater risk to runoff, field storage usually requires individual site assessment to minimize risk of contamination. Field storage is allowed but restricted in most jurisdictions. For example, in Wisconsin's Animal Feeding Operations Rules (2002), operators must have written approval to store waste in fields, this may be based on site and manure characteristics or may only be permitted in extreme circumstances. In Minnesota, field storage is prohibited on land with a slope greater than 6% or where the soil texture is coarser than sandy loam in order to avoid leaching and runoff. Under Wisconsin's Runoff Management Rules (2002), field storage is prohibited in defined Water Quality Management Areas 17. Non-normal conditions, such as weather, topography, management styles, or accidents are often factors in contamination events, unfortunately non-normal events are also difficult to regulate and prepare for. Under Iowa's Animal Feeding Operations (1999), the state has

17

Water Quality Management Area: the area within 1000ft from the ordinary high water mark of navigable waters

that consist of a lake, pond, or flowage, or a site that is susceptible to groundwater contamination. A site susceptible to groundwater contamination means 1) an area within 250ft of a private well, 2) an area within 1000ft of a municipal well, 3) an area within 300 feet upslope or 100 feet downslope of karst features, 4) a channel with a cross-sectional area equal to or greater than 3 square feet that flows to a karst feature, 5) an area where the soil depth to groundwater or bedrock is less than 2 ft, and 6) an area where the soil does not exhibit one of the following a) at least a 2-foot soil layer with 40(% fines or greater above groundwater and bedrock, b) at least a 3foot soil layer with 20% fines or greater above groundwater or bedrock, and c) at least a 5-foot soil layer with 10% fines or greater above groundwater and bedrock.

protected against any abnonnal conditions by including a clause stating that if topography, management procedures or other factors indicate a higher (or lesser) level of risk of water pollution then the department may establish different requirements for that operation. Similarly, Western Washington's Guidelines for Manure Management (1995) suggest that an extra month's storage capacity is recommended when abnonnal weather conditions prevail and land application of manure is halted. These clauses on non-nonnal conditions are unique and can aid in minimizing risk of pollution. 3.1.2.3 Storage in Other Countries In the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Production of Water in England (1998), pathogens are addressed. Specifically, the Code states that on operations where
Cryptosporidium has been diagnosed, slurries should be stored for as long as possible to kill as

many as possible and fann yard manure should be stored for at least 60 days before being utilized on land. The location of storage facilities with respect to domestic water supplies is not
addressed~

the facility must be located at least 10m from a watercourse, as well as 10m from a

drain field. Recommended capacity of the storage facility is only 120 days~ the shortest capacity of all nutrient management policies reviewed. Treatmene s is recommended to further kill pathogens before land application as well as to decrease the smell and decrease BOD levels of the waste. Opposite of England's Code of Practice, Finland's Decree on the Restriction of Discharge of Nitrates from Agriculture into Waters (2000) requires the largest storage capacity at 360 days accumulation. In detennining storage capacity, small outdoor yards and housing facilities with litter bedding should also be considered, along with the larger tanks and lagoons. This capacity can be reduced if the operator obtains a pennit showing that a portion of the manure is being transferred to another user. Field storage in Finland is only pennitted after manure has been composted for at least 90 days and has a dry matter content of at least 30%, this will reduce the risk of runoff and leaching. Field piles must be placed on top of a 15cm thick peat or mud layer to further reduce the leaching potential and must be covered with a tarp or a peat layer to avoid runoff from rainfall and evaporation and to contain odour, and cannot be located in the same place each year. Other storage facilities must be sited at least 10m from

any bodies of water; this MSD is consistent with the MSDs in the other countries for constructed storage facilities. In the exact manner as the England Code of Practice, the PEPF AA program in Scotland (1997) addresses specific measures in the case of Cryptosporidium diagnosis within an agricultural operation. To reduce Cryptosporidiurn contamination or spread within the herd, storage of waste should be prolonged, slurries should be stored as long as possible, and storage of solid manure should be at least 60 days. Although unlike the English Code, location of storage facilities with respect to wells and springs must be at least SOm and as far away as possible from residences on and offthe farm property. MSDs to watercourses and field drains are consistent with other countries at 10m. Treatment of waste while in storage is recommended based on type of waste and individual farm operations. Mechanical separation, anaerobic digestion, aerobic treatment, the acidification of slurry, the addition of nitrification inhibi tors, and compo sting are all recommended, see Appendix 3.13. Storage requirements in the Netherlands Manure and Fertilizer Policy (1999) are not addressed. 180 days storage capacity is required to get through the winter months and is consistent with Scotland's capacity requirements.

3.1.2.4 Storage Conclusions
Few policies address pathogens with respect to storage requirements. England's Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Production of Water (1998) and Scotland's PEPFAA program (1997) do address pathogens with respect to a Cryptosporidiurn diagnosis on the farm. Certain storage requirements are imposed in order to render the Cryptosporidiurn nonviable prior to land application of the waste. Considering pathogen infection can go undetected within a herd, wastes should always be assumed to carry pathogenic materials at all times and these storage requirements should be imposed on all wastes to reduce the risk of contamination once applied to land.
It should be noted that treatment of manure in storage has also been overlooked in these

policies and guidelines. Treatments such as anaerobic digestion or aeration have been shown to be effective at reducing pathogen levels in livestock waste. In the policies that do address treatment, such as Michigan's Generally Accepted Agriculture and Management Practices (2002), treatment methods are described but none are required or recommended.

47

It is difficult to detennine whether these storage regulations will help to control

pathogen contamination because the type of storage method utilized is at the discretion of the operators. The type of storage method used could reduce pathogen loads in waste, such as lagoons, composting or batch storage, but since methods are not known the pathogen reduction potential of these regulations is uncertain.

3.1.3 Land Application of Manure Economically and environmentally the best method of utilizing manure is to spread it on the land, and the nutrient management guidelines that have been reviewed recommend it. If applied properly and in the correct amounts, manure not only provides nutrients but also acts as a soil amendment (Manure Management Task Group, 1991). The application recommendations are made to ensure that manure or runoff does not create a risk to the environment or an inappropriate disturbance, and/or enter a common body of water by leaving the land on which the manure is applied (Amrani, 2002). Developing and following proper manure management plans ensures that the components in manure are applied to agricultural land to meet crop nutrient requirements. Land application of manure focuses on four major points: setback distances, winter spreading, incorporation of manure, and rates of application. The tables in Appendices 3.14, 3.15 and 3.16 show the detailed infonnation about land application regulations in each jurisdiction that is discussed in the following sections for Canada, United States and the other countries, respectively. 3.1.3.1 Land Application of Manure in Canada In the British Columbia Agricultural Waste Control Regulation (1992) no specific setback distances are required, instead there are a broad set of conditions that are unfavorable for application, including winter field-application, on areas having standing water, in diverting winds and on saturated soils. These conditions are very broad and it would be difficult to detennine the correct spreading times and situations if these were the only constraints given. These regulations do not discuss incorporation or tillage methods. Application rates are not defined; this regulation simply states not to exceed the amount of nutrients required for crop growth. The Alberta Agricultural Operations Practices Act (2001) is much more detailed in its requirements regarding land application of manure compared to the BC Regulation. MSDs are

given for frozen or snow-covered land and for forage or direct seeded crop based on a function ofthe slope of the land l9 · Ifthese MSDs are followed, winter application is allowed. Other setbacks include 30m from a well and 30m from a common body of water, if subsurface injection is used only a 10m separation from a common body of water is required. Soil testing is required every three years if operators apply more than 300 tonnes of manure annually. Although both setbacks and limits must be followed, incorporation must also take place within 48 hours of application, except in the winter months when the ground is frozen or on forage or direct seeded crops. The Saskatchewan Agricultural Operations Act (1995) requires a land application plan that must include specific details regarding normally accepted agricultural practices. These best management practices are found in the Saskatchewan Livestock Operations Guidelines (2001). The Guidelines have established MSDs based on application and tillage methods to minimize both public nuisance and water contamination 20 . Provincial regulations do not specifically prohibit winter spreading; however it is not a recommended practice. Incorporation is also strongly recommended within 24 hours to minimize the risk of manure being washed away in a rainfall and the potential of neighbouring complaints. Minimizing excessive nutrient losses by targeting application rates to meet crop requirements is mentioned but not required and calculation instructions are not given. The Manitoba Livestock Manure and Mortalities Management Regulation (1998) gives no specific MSDs, instead the regulation uses land characteristics to determine if spreading is appropriate but these land characteristics, including meteorological, topographical or soil conditions, are broad and do not define any specifics for the operator. No operator in Manitoba is allowed to spread manure between November 10th of one year and April 15 th of the following year except in accordance with the MSDs shown in Appendix 3.19. Incorporation and methods of application are not discussed in the regulation. No testing of the soil or manure is required but rates of nitrate-nitrogen must not exceed given ratios that are a function of the type of crop and the type of manure. In the Quebec Regulation Respecting Agricultural Operations (2002) operators require a land application plan if the land-base to be manured is greater than 15 hectares. Minimum

separation distances of 30m are given for land application between both watercourses and wells. Quebec also has a MSD of 1m for the distance between manure-applied fields and ditches that could drain into other bodies of water. Winter application is prohibited for the 6 months between October 1st and March 31 st. Spreading is also prohibited using sprinklers or liquid manure cannons. The spreading of manure must adhere to the fertilization limits according to the "Phosphated Fertilization Standard" in Quebec to minimize the risk of soil and water contamination. The New Brunswick Livestock Operations Act Regulation 99-32 (1999) does not discuss specific land application requirements and only touches on them in the requirements for the nutrient management plans. The New Brunswick Manure Management Guidelines (1997) are more comprehensive in dealing with this issue. Setback distances from a watercourse depend on the type of manure and whether incorporation will take place. Liquid manure cannot be spread within 300m of watercourses and solid manure cannot be spread less than 30m from the bank of a watercourse unless incorporation occurs within one day. A 75m buffer from manure-applied land protects domestic water supplies and wellheads. Incorporation of manure within 24 hours is only required during the summer months when manure is spread within 200m of a residence. Winter application is strongly unadvised by the guidelines and where runoff is a risk, manure should not be spread if rain is expected within 24 hours at anytime of the year. Applications rates are not to exceed the nitrogen requirements of the crops in order to minimize excess nitrogen in the soil. The Nova Scotia Guidelines for the Management and Use of Animal Manure (1991) and the Siting and Management of Hog Farms Guidelines (2001) both have very similar land application requirements. Appendix 3.20 shows that MSDs to watercourses are a function of the slope of the land and soil type, as well as dug and drilled wells. Incorporation is also recommended as soon as possible to minimize the risk of contamination even further. Winter spreading is strongly ill advised in order to avoid runoff and due to the fact that incorporation in the winter is difficult ifnot impossible. Both documents require that both nitrogen and phosphorus rates are monitored and do not exceed the requirements of the crop. In Prince Edward Island there is not a lot of extra arable land on the island therefore many livestock operators do not have a sufficient land base to apply all of the manure that their operations produce. The Manure Management Guidelines (1999) require spreading agreements

with landowners who do not generate manure but only cash crop. Appendix 3.21 shows the recommended setback distances for spreading manure in PEL These MSDs reveal that the other major industry in PEl is tourism and that these two industries must cooperate so that they can prosper together. Unfortunately, these MSDs do not exhibit much proof of being scientifically based, which would ensure minimal contamination. Again, winter application is not recommended. These guidelines require that the application rate of manure should not exceed the amount necessary to meet the crop nitrogen requirements. A choice between two methods is presented, one in which an estimated land base area using typical nutrient production rates is used or a more detailed site-specific method based on manure and soil samples is the preferred choice.

3.1.3.2 Land Application of Manure in United States
In the state of Washington, the Dairy Nutrient Management Act (1998) and the Manure Management Guidelines for Western Washington (1995) have been reviewed. These two pieces of legislation fit well together because the Act does not identify specific management regulations, whereas the Guidelines provide recommended practices so that operators may stay in compliance with the Act. Specifically, the Management Act simply states that priority land application should be located on fields with gentle slopes located away from watercourses. When application is needed on greater sloping fields, other protection measures must be taken. However, the Washington Guidelines give specific MSDs form sensitive areas with which to comply, for example, application from watercourses and ditches should be between 3 and 9m, and from wells at least 30-60m. Incorporation is required in both regulations. As well, winter application is prohibited in both regulations. The Washington Act indiscriptly states that application is not allowed if a potential risk of discharge into waters exists, and the guidelines are not much more specific by stating that application cannot take place on bare com fields between September and February unless the waste is solid or a separated solid. Application is also prohibited on saturated soils and when rain is in the 24-hour forecast. Rates of application are addressed in the Guidelines and are based on soil infiltration rate, therefore they are field specific for every operation and should be based on both soil and manure type. The Guidelines also addressed grassland or pasture management. A pre-harvesting period of 30 days is recommended after land application to allow for die-off of disease-causing bacteria and

viruses. This regulation is key to avoiding reintroduction of infection within herds if these crops are used as fodder for livestock. The liquid application requirements of Iowa's Chapter 65 Rules for Animal Feeding Operations (1999) are shown in Appendix 3.23. Tables 1 and 2 of the Appendix suggest that these MSDs are based on odour and nuisance to the public since the only MSD to differ in Table Two between the low and high pressure irrigation methods is the distance to public use areas. This Act also allows either a 61 m MSD to watercourses and wellheads, or, if a 15m vegetated buffer strip is constructed then no MSD is required. Winter application in Iowa is strongly discouraged, but if necessary must only take place on fields with slopes less than or equal to 4%. Missouri's land application requirements are similar to Iowa's in that MSDs depend on the method of application used and its nuisance potential to the public. For example, if manure is applied through an irrigation system, then a 45.72m MSD is required between the applied field and the public area, but if manure is applied by tank wagon or solid spreader, then only a 15.24m distance is required. Missouri has the largest required MSD between a manured field and a domestic water supply at 91.4m; others include 15.24m from a ditch and 60.96m between applied fields and surface water sources. Wisconsin's Runoff Management Regulations (2002) do not discuss land application; instead application rates and minimum separation distances are developed for individual operators and recorded in the nutrient management plan. Land application requirements are included in the Guidelines for Applying Manure in Wisconsin (1995). Appendix 3.22 discusses areas suitable for land application, for example, when the ground is frozen, application is permitted at a distance of 91.44m from streams, 304.8m from lakes, on fields with a soil layer of 50cm or more over bedrock, and on fields with slopes less than 6%. These guidelines also address no-till practices by restricting application on land that will not be tilled within 3 days, see Appendix 3.22. Areas where application is never recommended include areas where water flow concentrates and heads toward sensitive areas or floods frequently, and in fields with less than a 25cm soil layer between the surface and bedrock. These guidelines suggest application rates of less than 25 tonnes of manure per acre per year and phosphorous rates of 150lb per acre.

Michigan's Guidelines on the other hand suggest a much smaller phosphorous rate of 42lb per acre. Michigan's Guidelines recommend a MSD of 45.72m between manured fields and surface waters if no practices are used to protect against runoff and erosion. Incorporation of manure is required as soon as possible on lands with slopes greater than 6% and is highly recommended on all fields. Winter application (snow-covered or frozen soil) is to be avoided, but if it is deemed necessary, then manure can only be applied on land with slopes of 6% or less and slurry must only be applied on slopes of 3% or less. Winter application can also only occur on fields that have made provisions for soil erosion, for example, constructed vegetated buffer strips along the boundaries. Michigan's Guidelines address the utilization of stored runoff water, unlike any other jurisdiction reviewed. If runoff water is applied, then soils must be able to accept the water, and the crops must be able to use the nutrients, this application should be saved until there is a dry period when the water could be beneficial. Minnesota's Feedlot Rules (2000) and regulations are substantially based around 'specially protected areas'. A specially protected area is defined as any land that is within 91.44m of a protected waterbody that has been identified by the state. For example, separation distances to surface waters of 7.6m are required, but if the waters are protected the required distance increases to 30.48m. Similarly, incorporation is only required on protected land or sloping lands, and winter application is only prohibited in protected areas. Application rates in Minnesota are based on phosphorous levels in the soil, and must be such that levels will not increase over a 6-year period. Method of application is also more restrictive in protected areas; traveling guns, center pivots and other equipment that can distribute manure more that 15.24m is prohibited, but can be used elsewhere. Nebraska's regulations and Acts are similar to Washington's in that Nebraska's Title 130 Rules and Regulations (1972) are utilized in order to comply with the Livestock Waste Management Act (1998). Land application of manure is prohibited within 9 .14m of surface water, additionally, a vegetated buffer must be constructed or manure must be incorporated if it is applied within 30.48m. Application is prohibited in the winter and on any other days other than 'dewatering' days. Dewatering days as defined as days that have both suitable weather and soil conditions for land application, for example, not on days when soil is saturated. Application rates in Nebraska must be based on the crop's agronomic nitrogen rate and phosphorous must be limited at 150ppm. Reduced runoff potential of pathogens and nutrients

is required, when manure is applied within 30.48m of surface water, through immediate incorporation or direct injection of waste into soil.
3.1.3.3 Land Application of Manure in Other Countries

Maintenance is the key in the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Production of Water in England (1998). Proactive examinations of irrigation devices and water courses are encouraged to reduce the risk of water contamination or catch water contamination in a timely manner. Incorporation of manure is required and must be incorporated horizontally on sloped fields to avoid direct channeling with which waste and water runoff could flow. Injection is restricted in fields with drainage systems and must be disked no deeper than the crop's active root zone to avoid leaching in the soil matrix before the roots can take up the nutrients. Grassed buffers are required around watercourses and ditches, and a minimum separation of 10m is required between these and land applied with manure. Waste must be applied at least 50m away from domestic water supply wells, cannot be spread on soil with less than 30cm between the surface and bedrock, and is severely restricted on sloping land. Application rates must not exceed 25m 3/halyr. Vegetated buffer strips are required when applying manure to land adjacent to watercourses, wells and drains in the Decree on the Restriction of Discharge of Nitrates from Agriculture into Waters (2000) in Finland. All MSDs must be vegetated to further reduce risk of runoff. These MSDs are consistent with most of the other countries reviewed. 10m from a watercourse is standard; and Finland's MSD to a domestic water supply is based on site characteristics. Scotland's PEPF AA policy (1997) suggests that all operators create field maps siting the risks and suitability of the land for waste application. High, medium and low risk categories ofland are defined and must be mapped, see Appendix 3.24 for definitions. Separation distances between land applied with manure and water courses are the same as the MSDs required for the separation of storage facilities and manured fields. Since storage facilities are required to be impermeable and enclosed, it seems that the MSDs for land application should be greater given that manure is exposed to environmental elements and can travel. This is the same fault with all of the minimum separation distances in all of the policies reviewed. Grassed buffer strips are required around watercourses at a recommended width of 10m to retard runoff from manured fields. Application is prohibited on saturated, snow-

covered, frozen and sloping surfaces greater than 15 degrees. Spreading is also prohibited when fields have been pipe or mole drained or sub-soiled over existing drains within the last 12 months. Application rates depend on type of material and method used, see Appendix 3.25. For example, slurry that is injected can be applied at greater rates than slurry that is surfaceapplied. The Netherlands Manure and Fertilizer Policy (1999) does not give any restrictions with regards to separation distances between manured fields and sensitive geographical features such as watercourses. These restrictions are likely found in another policy legislated in the Netherlands. It does however, restrict the timing of application. Manure cannot be spread on land when it is frozen or snow-covered, and even if it isn't, manure absolutely cannot be spread between September I sl and February 151 on sandy soils. Application is also prohibited on fields with slopes of 7% or greater. Compared to other jurisdictions, a 7% slope is the most restrictive, other slope restrictions have been around 10%. To avoid ammonia emissions, manure must be injected into the soil.

3.1.3.4 Land Application Conclusions
Within the policies reviewed, land application regulations are inconsistent and vary greatI/l. Some policies require absolute setback distances, whereas others are based on a formula that takes into account topography, type of waste, and method of application. Many of the policies have also included MSDs that are based on odour potential, not risk of contamination of water sources. Pathogens are addressed with respect to land application regulations in only one of the policies reviewed. The Manure Management Guidelines for Western Washington (1995) addresses pathogens with respect to grazing management. .The guidelines recommend a 30 day pre-harvesting period after land application of wastes to allow for die-off of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. This regulation is used to avoid the reintroduction of infection within herds where fields are used as fodder. It is likely that most of the other policies assume that pathogens are controlled in the same way as nutrients are controlled and need not be addressed separately. A better understanding oftheir control based on existing scientific studies of the transport and fate of pathogenic organisms in agricultural environments is needed; this is the basis of Chapter 4. Until transport and fate of pathogenic organisms is understood, the

effectiveness of these regulations at reducing the risk of pathogen contamination in water sources is unknown.

3.2 Bill 81: The Nutrient Management Act, 2002
Ontario's Bill 81, the Nutrient Management Act, was passed on June 2ih, 2002. This new legislation addresses environmental concerns and management of land-applied materials containing nutrients. It provides a management framework for Ontario's agricultural industry as well as other generators of nutrient-containing materials including municipalities' sewage sludge. The framework combines environmental protection guidelines for the management of nutrients with current best management practices. The need for this legislation was addressed at a consultation session in early 2000 held by the Task Force on Intensive Agricultural Operations in Rural Ontario involving fanners, environmental consultants, municipalities and other stakeholders. Since the Walkerton tragedy in May 2000, this legislation has received increased attention and the province quickly moved to develop and implement the Act. It is now part of the province's Clean Water Strategy that was highly recommended by Justice O'Connor following the Walkerton Inquiry. This legislation is also considered an essential tool in source water protection which is the first barrier in a multiple barrier approach 22 to drinking water protection. In light of new expectations of water protection given the recent events in Walkerton, the question is what in this new legislation addresses pathogen management and does it depart significantly from other nutrient management acts? The Act focuses on new requirements such as a registry of all applicators and generators of nutrient-containing materials as well as the review and approval of Nutrient Management Plans and Nutrient Management Strategies, similar to the separate plans that are required in Delaware. Nutrient units are the key to the new Act. The Act uses a nutrient unit system, rather than a livestock or animal unit system, to measure the amount of nutrients within the waste. Therefore, operators are classified on the amount of nutrient-containing materials generated. For example, livestock operators will measure the level of nutrients that are excreted by their livestock. Nutrient units are used because this Act is simply not focused

22 The multiple barrier approach involves a set of protection measures put in place to guard against contamination of drinking water. The barriers in this approach include source water protection, water treatment, properly maintained and operated water treatment facilities, and comprehensive training of water treatment operators.

on nutrients obtained from agricultural operations but also from municipal sewage treatment plants, and food processing plants, therefore livestock or animal units are irrelevant. One nutrient unit (NU) is representative of the amount of nutrient-containing waste that is required to fertilize one acre of cropland. In Spring 2003, public consultations were held across Ontario allowing stakeholders to voice concerns and questions regarding the new regulations. Both Agriculture Minister Helen Johns and Environment Minister Chris Stockwell were present during the consultations and have made amendments to the regulations based on concerns and suggestions that were raised. The review of the Nutrient Management Act (2002) is focused on the three common issues: nutrient management plans, storage of manures and land application of manures.

3.2.1 Nutrient Management Plans
This act requires two types of approaches, a nutrient management strategy (NMS) and a nutrient management plan (NMP). Most other jurisdictions, other than Delaware, require only one plan because they are focused solely on wastes from agricultural operations. In the NMA, all generators of nutrient-containing materials, including municipal waste treatment plants, abbatoirs, nurseries and food processing plants, are required to be in compliance with the Act. The NMSs must address the generation and reception of waste containing nutrients. Nutrient management strategies are required of all generators of nutrient-containing materials. They must also include the signed contracts between nutrient importers and exporters, a description of the operation, nutrient analysis of materials, and a list of storage facilities to accommodate the material in an environmentally sound manner, see Appendix 3.26 for a complete list of components required. Nutrient management plans on the other hand are developed to describe how nutrient-containing material will be applied to the land. These plans are based on the components of the nutrients and the characteristics of the fields. These plans must be created by livestock operators who keep their manures, as well as cash-croppers that utilize the waste of other operations that do not have sufficient land-base for the amount of nutrients they generate, those operators who accept and apply sewage sludge, such as orchards or nurseries. NMPs will include calculations of the land-base available for nutrient application, soil test results conducted every 5 years, crop requirements, and allocation of materials across the operation's fields based on the runoff potential of the land, and the proximity to sensitive areas such as watercourses, residences or domestic water supplies, see Appendix 3.26 for full details.

57

Within both the NMP and NMS, contingency plans must be developed. These plans must detail actions that will be taken if equipment breaks down and causes a spill, storage structures are found to leak, weather conditions hinder planned application times, or there is simply more nutrient material that was accounted for in the plans or strategies. Both NMPs and NMSs must also be approved by certified personnel that work for the MOE or OMAF, and must be updated at least every 5 years. If the amount of nutrients generated or received increases by more than 20% or the operation expands by more than 30NU, a new NMS must be developed. Similarly, a NMP must be revised before the 5 year deadline if there is an increase of20% or more in the amount of nutrients utilized, the crop removal of nitrogen decreases by more than 20%, or land available for application decreases by more than 10%. All operations will be subject to inspection programs by provincial officers based on their approved nutrient management plans and/or strategies.

3.2.2 Storage of Nutrients
The NMA contains extensive storage regulations including; capacity requirements, minimum separation distances from sensitive areas, and specific field storage requirements, but only addresses the treatment of manure briefly when discussing field storage, see Appendix 3.25 for details. It should be noted that the flooring of an outdoor housing facility is considered to be a constructed storage facility in the Act. The minimum separation distances for the siting of a constructed manure storage facility are generally consistent with other jurisdictions reviewed. In Canada, MSDs to watercourses range from 30m to 100m, the NMA requires 50m. Fifty meters seems like a distance that was chosen so the province could remain in neutral territory compared to the other provinces, it is a safe distance because it is not the least distance, yet it is far from the 100m that other provinces have required. Private domestic water supplies that are protected by a 6-ft underground casing can be as close as 15m to a storage facility; those that do not have the casing require a 30m distance. Municipal wells on the other hand must be at least 100m away. Most other jurisdictions in Canada do not distinguish between the types of wells and most commonly require a 100m distance between both type and a storage facility, although Minnesota, Texas and Nebraska have developed their regulations in this manner as well. The capacity of manure storage that is required is one of the highest in the country, behind Alberta and British Columbia, at 240 days. Less capacity will be approved by an officer

58

if it can be shown that the combined capacity of an operator and his/her manure broker equals 240 days. Like the Finland Decree, field storage is extensively covered in the NMA and it is here that composting is addressed. Firstly, waste can only be stored in-field ifit is located on a slope of 3° or less, not in a flood plain area, and has a water content ofless than 70%. Piles can remain untreated and uncovered for 60 days, or 120 days if the pile is composted or covered. Field stores must be located at further distances from sensitive areas than constructed storage facilities, which is reasonable considering that field piles are exposed to the elements and have a greater chance of leaching or being transported in rainfall into nearby waters. Operators must be aware of their soil classifications and keep field piles off of soils that have a high infiltration rate to further reduce the risk of pollution through leaching. Similar to other jurisdictions within in Canada, treatment is not adequately addressed. Treatment methods, other than composting, should be addressed in the legislation, especially in a country where compo sting is only adequate for less than half of the year due to winter temperatures.
3.2.3 Land Application of Manure in the NMA

With respect to land application of materials containing nutrients in the NMA, nonagricultural materials such as sewage sludge, and liquid agricultural materials are treated as riskier materials than solid manure. This can be seen in many of the minimum separation distances presented in the Act. For example, with respect to municipal wells, liquid agricultural materials cannot be spread within the 2-year time of travel zone unless the land has been tilled within the last 7 days and the rate of application is less than 40m 3/ha. Non-agricultural materials cannot be spread within the 2-year time of travel zone under any circumstances, whereas solid agricultural manure must only remain at least 100m from the well. Municipal well restrictions are greater than private well restrictions because of the risk of exposing a greater number of people if contamination were to occur in the municipal wells. Land application separation distances to private wells are the same as those for constructed storage facilities; 15m for wells with water-tight casing that extends 6 feet below ground and 30m for those that do not, and non-agricultural materials must be spread at least 90m away from the wellhead if it does not have a casing.

59

In the case where agricultural operators do not have to complete a NMP, land application of non-agricultural wastes and liquid agricultural wastes in fields adjacent to surface waters must be at least 20m from the top of the bank of the water, and solid agricultural material can be applied as close as 10m away. Akin to Texas' CAFO Rules, vegetated buffer zones (VBZ) are required in fields adjacent to watercourses for those operators that must complete a NMP. A VBZ is defined in the Act as a 3m wide strip of continuous vegetated cover measured from the top of the bank of the watercourse. These zones must be constructed prior to the date in which operations must be in total compliance of the plan and Act. Once VBZ are in place, operators cannot spread any materials containing phosphorous or nitrogen within 13m from the top of the bank of the waterbody, unless the materials are injected, incorporated within 24 hours, or applied to land covered with a living crop. These regulations suggest that the runoff potential of a tilled field with a 3m-wide vegetated buffer strip is equal to a non-tilled field with a non-vegetated buffer of 10m. These regulations also address no-till production systems by requiring larger separation distances when no-till systems are practiced. The filtration of nutrient containing materials through the soil matrix is addressed in the minimum separation distances that are given for both bedrock and groundwater. A minimum of 90cm must separate the surface from the permanent water table, with a minimum of 30cm unsaturated topsoil. The MSD to bedrock is slightly larger at 150cm. This is a strict MSD for non-agricultural materials, but there are exceptions for agricultural materials dependent upon the type of material, if tilling has taken place and the rate of application, see Appendix 3.27 for details. Again, this specific regulation addresses no-till production systems. Because no-till production systems allow easier vertical transport of waste due to undisturbed macropores in the soil matrix, required vertical distances between the surface and bedrock are increased to disrupt infiltration and decrease the risk of groundwater contamination. Rates of application are important in the Act and are primarily based on site specific characteristics of the fields such as soil hydrologic group, topography, and method of application, see Appendix 3.28. For rates of application, runoff potential must first be determined based on the soil and the slope of the land. Once runoff potential has been determined, various application rates are given, dependent on whether the materials are surface applied, injected, incorporated or applied on land that had been pre-tilled. Incorporation is not necessarily required unless the land is within 450m of a residence, residential area, health or

educational facility. If the land is greater than 450m from these structures, the material is only required to be incorporated if it has an odour rating of 03, see Appendix 3.29 for odour ratings. Incorporation requirements are based on the land's proximity to these areas and how odourous the material is. No application is permitted within 25m of a single residence and 50m of a residential area, health or educational facility. If the land where materials are being applied is between 25-90m of a single dwelling and 50-450m of the other designated areas, incorporation is required for materials rated 02 and 03, and highly recommended for 01 material. Incorporation is not required in fields adjacent to watercourses but if wastes are incorporated the area of land that can be applied is greater because the separation distances are cut back. Winter application is not necessarily prohibited but is severely restricted. No nutrients can be applied to land that is snow-covered or frozen at any time of the year. 'Winter' is defined as the period between December 1sl of one year and March 31 sl of the following year, during this time restrictions apply. Non-agricultural and liquid agricultural materials cannot be applied to fields with slopes greater than 3%, the same applies to solid manure on slopes greater than 6%. Because of the higher risk of runoff during the colder months, application is prohibited on lands that are subject to flooding and ponding, and areas where direct flow leads to surface waters. If the weather conditions during this time allow for the application of materials, then, the materials must be injected, incorporated within 6 hours, or surface-applied only on land that is covered by a living crop. Application rates must also be halved during this time, or separation distances to surface waters must be expanded to 20m. Application to land that has been tile drained is only restricted for non-agricultural materials and liquid agricultural materials. Tile drains must be monitored during application of these materials unless the field has been tilled within the last 7 days or the rate of application is less than 40m3/ha. Again, this shows that non-agricultural and liquid agricultural materials are considered riskier materials than solid manure. This is also shown in sections 6.14 and 6.15 of the Act, focusing on pre-harvest and pre-grazing waiting periods after land-application. These periods are prescribed for non-agricultural material only. Similar to Washington's regulation, these waiting periods should also be required for areas applied with agricultural wastes, as it has been shown that manure from livestock operations also contains a number of diseasecausing pathogens that survive on surfaces, in the subsurface and in runoff, see Chapter 4. These regulations do not address the issue of pathogens in agricultural waste, and assumes that

61

they do not pose the same microbiological risks as non-agricultural wastes. This fault or omission within the Act strongly suggests that it will not successfully substitute as a pathogen management program. Again, with respect to land application of wastes, the regulation that was specifically created for the control of nutrients mayor may not be effective at controlling pathogens; existing studies on the transport and fate of pathogens will help to determine the Act's effectiveness.

3.3 Comprehensiveness of Policies
All water sources are better protected when policies such as those reviewed are put in place, but the comprehensiveness of policies will ensure better protection. Comprehensiveness is defined as including much or all; this can be interpreted as the inclusion of all the various operations that take place within a farming operation, the inclusion of all the types of farming operations that are subject to the policies and the inclusion of all types of nutrients and contaminants that can cause contamination. If the protection of water quality is the primary goal, all contaminants need to be addressed, including both phosphorous, nitrogen and the abundant microbial contaminants that are contained within these wastes. Most policies that were reviewed focused specifically on one contaminant, namely nitrogen because of its effects on human health as well as the environment, and rarely addressed the existence of microbial organisms. The prevalence, abundance and persistence of these pathogenic microorganisms within wastes alone should be enough to implement policies and regulations for their control. This lack of specific pathogen control strategies stems from an assumption that nutrient management policies are proxies for pathogen management policies, and therefore only one contaminant is targeted. Comprehensiveness is enhanced when all sources of these contaminants are included in the regulations and the precautionary principle is taken. Ontario's NMA encompasses all generators of nutrients including non-agricultural generators of nutrient- containing substances,
such as municipal sewage and food processing wastes. This is a large market that is not

included in these types of policies in other jurisdictions. Originally, Ontario's NMA had required all types and sizes of agricultural operations to be in compliance of it's regulations within a certain date. However, a statement has just been released from the Ontario government stating that small farms will no longer have to comply with the Act by the previous deadline of2008 (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food, 2003). Currently, the

i

province is deliberating about whether small farms will have to comply to the regulations, therefore the comprehensiveness of this Act in terms of the inclusion of all operations has been reduced. Similarly, those policies that address only concentrated animal feeding operations allow significant quantities of nutrients to go unmanaged. In most jurisdictions, in terms of numbers, small farming operations far exceed larger operations, if these operations are not included, it is hard to say whether the policies will be effective overall and minimize risk of contamination. All processes within agricultural operations must be addressed. The focus has been on storage and land application of these nutrients on fields containing crops, while barnyard areas and grazing management have been addressed inadequately. When fields are used as grazing sites, wastes are randomly and sporadically distributed therefore these areas should also be addressed, and the fact that it is not a controlled application is also important. Washington's Regulations require pre-harvesting periods on land that has been applied with agricultural waste to increase the die-off of disease-causing microorganisms. Similarly, Ontario's NMA requires both pre-harvesting and pre-grazing waiting periods: but for non-agricultural wastes only. Unfortunately, one of the biggest limitations of Ontario's new Act is the assumption that agricultural wastes do not pose a microbiological threat, as wastes such as sewage sludge do. The issue of microbial prevalence in agricultural waste is not addressed adequately in any of the policies. Treatment is also inadequately addressed and is closely related to the issue of microbial contamination. If pathogens and other bacteria were addressed more satisfactorily, the issue of treatment may be addressed also because of the ability of treatment processes to sufficiently kill pathogenic organisms. Some policies include shorter MSDs if manure or wastes have been treated prior to application but the treatment process itself is not discussed. Erosion and sediment control strategies are critical for decreased contamination of source waters, considering that nutrients and pathogens are adsorbed onto soil particles and can be transported in runoff waters. Wisconsin's 'Tolerable Soil Erosion Rate' prevents practices that will cause unsustainable levels of erosion and runoff based on soil type and tillage practices. Other controls include constructed vegetated buffer strips to retard sediment flow from reaching water sources. Erosion can also be controlled in grazing management, by

63

prohibiting livestock from reaching stream banks and providing man-made drinking water sources instead of streams or rivers. This would also decrease direct deposit into water sources. Any regulation that is based on site or operation characteristics will be more effective than homogenous regulations, for example rates of application and minimum separation distances all based on topography, hydrology, vegetation cover, waste type and method. No single minimum separation distance will be effective for every situation, those jurisdictions that take the time and energy to develop individual but understandable regulations should experience greater effectiveness. Homogenous MSDs can be ineffective and unfair in two ways; firstly, they can be too simple and be futile for a number of situations that are found on agricultural operations. Secondly, homogenous regulations are not always set at the least stringent distances, because the standard must try to encompass all situations it may be exaggerated. This could lead to a loss of land that cannot be fertilized and put some operators at an unfair disadvantage. Regulations that are based on site characteristics will ensure farm operators that they are utilizing the most of their land while minimizing risk of contamination. Comprehensiveness ofthe policies should also include the active participation of all those involved. If governments want to ensure these policies are being complied with, inspection programs should be enforced. Inspection programs will highlight the seriousness of the policy, and will ensure that nutrient management plans are followed and will detect when NMPs are ineffective and require revision. Participation should also include some proactive monitoring on the operator's part. Self-monitoring and reporting allows operators to determine for themselves how their plans are working, as they will have visible indicators of its effectiveness. Monitoring does not always have to be high tech, but can simply be descriptive such as the colouration of water sources on the property; any noticed floating algae mats or a decreased fish supply. More extensive monitoring involving Nand P levels or testing for microbial contaminants in water sources or in the shedding of livestock should be included in inspection programs. There is no commitment to this type of involvement within the new Nutrient Management Act (2002). No jurisdiction's policy needs to be exactly the same as another's in order to be comprehensive and effective. Because of the number of individual considerations that must be taken on each operation and the complicated science behind the regulations, an absolute solution to waste management would be ineffective. Policies must be inclusive and dynamic,

and regulators must allow new findings from applied research to be integrated so that policies are always inclusive of the latest knowledge. Denmark's Minister of Agriculture precisely stated that 'It isn't the farmers' fault that the goals for agriculture have not been achieved, but the fault of politicians' (Farmers Weekly, 1991). Politicians, policy makers, and regulators must always be aware of the latest knowledge, technology and emerging issues so that farmers can better prepare themselves and their operations to protect water quality.

Chapter Four: Scientific Knowledge about the Transport and Survival of Pathogens in Agricultural Surface and Subsurface Environments
As shown in Chapter 3, most manure management policies focus on the control of nitrogen and phosphorous in livestock wastes. Pathogens are left as non-targeted contaminants that are assumed to be controlled under the same regulations. An examination oftransport and survival of pathogens provides an understanding oftheir fate in the agricultural environment. This knowledge will then be used to assess the regulations of the Ontario Nutrient Management Act, 2002 and its ability to control pathogens. The studies reviewed include those that investigate transport and survival of pathogenic organisms in agricultural environments, including livestock waste storages and field conditions. It must be noted that there is a large amount of information on the issue of municipal waste application on farm land and the spread of pathogens, but these studies were not used in this work. The focus was on studies that analyzed microbial survival and transport in livestock manure and slurries.

4.1 Studies focusing on the Survival of Pathogens
The survival of pathogenic organisms is important because it can result in their ability to contaminate water sources if transport occurs. Based on the evidence, microbial survival depends on a number of interrelated factors including temperature and the antagonistic effects of other microorganisms. Several studies have examined how changes in these factors have affected survival in solid manure, slurry, soil and water.

4.1.1 Pathogen Survival in Manure

Studies show that pathogenic organisms have the ability to subsist in solid livestock waste (see Appendix 4.1). For example, Robertson et al. (1992) found Oyptosporidium parvum oocysts remain viable in cow manure for over 176 days. 2.8 x 107 oocysts were placed in a semi-permeable container that was buried in a bucket containing 25 litres of cow manure. The bucket was stored in the dark and kept at 4°C. Enumeration after 176 days found 39.6% (1.1 x 10 7) of the oocysts viable.

66

Similarly, Jenkins et al. (1997) also studied C. parvum survival at 4°C. C. parvum oocysts (10 6 oocystslg) were seeded into cal f feces and stored in glass containers in the dark. Dye permeability results showed 14% of oocysts were still viable after 259 days in one ,I container, and 10% of the oocysts remained viable for 410 days in another container. For bacteria, Maule's study (1997) of Escherichia coli showed less extensive survival rates than the protozoa studies. Survival of the bacteria was greatest in vegetated soil cores. Viable numbers in this environment remained high at 107/g of soil after 130 days. E. coli remained viable in cattle feces for 50 days, and for 27 days in both cattle slurry and water. Temperature has been shown to affect pathogen survivability in livestock waste. Temperature can be controlled in laboratory environments and has been examined in a number of studies. Wang et al. (1996) studied the survi val of E. coli 0157: H 7 and demonstrated that the bacteria could persist for long periods of time at lower temperatures. This study examined survival at 5, 22 and 37°C. At 5°C the organism survived for 63 and 70 days in low and high inoculum levels respectively. Survival was reduced at 22 and 37°C. At 22°C survival was 49 and 56 days for the low and high inoculum levels respectively, and at 37°C survival was 21 days for both levels. Himathongkham et al. (1999; 2000) conducted a study on the survival of Salmonella
typhimurium and E. coli 0 157:H7 in both poultry and cow manure. Plastic bags containing

either poultry or cow waste were seeded with 103 _10 CFU/g of both E. coli and S.
typhimllrium and were incubated at 4,20 or 37°C. In the cattle manure, T90 23 values were

greatest at 20°C, whereas in poultry manure T90 values were greatest at 4°C. Similarly, Fukushima et al. (1999) studied E. coli 0157 :H7 survivability at 5, 15, and 25°C. Survivability was greatest at 15°C in the cattle waste that had been inoculated with 105
E. coli/g. However, at an inoculation level of 10 E. coli/g, survivability was the same at each

temperature. Bolton et al. (1999) found that there was no significant difference in the survival of E.
coli 0157 in bovine feces when it was held at a constant temperature of 10°C compared to

outdoor temperatures that ranged from -6.5 to 19°C. The waste was inoculated with 1.7 x lOR
CFU/g and placed in sealed containers. Die-off rates under either condition were similar; at

the end of the 99 day study the number of viable E. coli had declined to 1.5 x 103 CFU/g.

The effect of temperature on protozoa survival in feces has also been studied. Olsen et al. (1999) studied both Cryptosporidium and Giardia survival in calf feces, soil, and water at 4, 4 and 25°C. In the manure experiments, the feces were mixed thoroughly with the protozoa to yield a concentration of 105 cysts/g and 107 oocysts/g. This study, the only one to examine Giardia survival, showed that Giardia cysts are much less viable in feces than any of the other organisms examined. Survival was less than one week at -4°C, and one week at both 4 and 25°C. Cryptosporidium survival was greater than 12 weeks at -4°C, 8 weeks at 4°C and four weeks at 25°C. Not only do pathogens survive for substantial periods of time in manure environments, some studies also showed that growth of bacteria occurred. In both Fukushima et al. (1999) and Wang et al. (1996), it was reported that before E. coli 0157:H7 began to die-off, they increased in number. Growth occurred at 22 and 37°C in the latter study and at all temperatures in Fukushima et al. (1999). The results of these studies show that storage of manure for extended periods of time will result in increased pathogen die-off. Results also show that temperature could be used during storage of wastes to kill viable organisms and therefore reduce the risk of pathogen contamination during handling of the waste.

4.1.2 Pathogen Survival in Slurry Combining livestock wastes for easier handling within an agricultural operation is a common practice. Urine, manure, and wastewater collected and stored together is referred to as slurry. The liquid consistency of slurries allows them to be easily pumped to storage and field locations. During slurry storage, pathogenic organisms have been shown to persist (see Appendix 4.2). It must be noted that the data regarding pathogen survival in slurry are limited to bacterial studies conducted in the 1960 and 1970s; therefore, it must be assumed that there has been no change in manure handling techniques. In cattle slurry, Rankin and Taylor (1969) studied the survival of S. typhimurium, Salmonella dublin, and E. coli. All pathogens were seeded into the slurry at a level of 5.5 x 106 to 8.8 x 106/ml. The inoculated slurry was stored in covered seven gallon tanks and left outdoors from mid-January to mid-April in England. The experiment was conducted for 77

days. At this time, the viable numbers of both Salmonella species were 102/ml, and E. coli were reduced to 103Iml. Burrows and Rankin (1970) also investigated the survival of E. coli (l 06 /m l) and S. typhimurium (106Iml) in cattle slurry in England. Slurry from five different farming operations was collected and seeded with the bacteria. One bin containing 9 gallons of slurry from each farm was used for each bacterium studied. The bins were kept indoors between October and February in England. Both S. typhimurium and E. coli survived up to 63 days. E. coli survived up to 77 days in one sample from a farm that had cleaned its slurry tank three times per week. Therefore it was demonstrated that the bacteria survived longest in the bin with the freshest slurry. The authors indicate that this is due to the increased amount of dissolved oxygen that would be available in fresh slurry and its ability to maintain aerobic bacteria. Maule (1997) also investigated the ability of E. coli to survive in cattle slurry. He found E. coli survived in slurry for 27 days compared to 50 days in solid feces. The effect of temperature on pathogen survival in slurry is similar to the results from the solid manure studies. Bacterial survival is greater at lower temperatures. For example, Jones (1976) studied S. dublin survival in cattle slurry. 400 ml samples of slurry were seeded with 106 organisms/ml of S. dublin and stored at 5, 10, 20, and 30°e. Survival at both 5 and 100e was 132 days, whereas at 20 and 30 o e, survival was reduced to 57 and 13 days respectively. Himanthongkham et al. (1999; 2000) obtained similar results. A series of experiments were conducted on the survival of S. typhimurium and E. coli 0157:H7 in both poultry and cow slurry at 4, 20, and 37°e. Slurry samples were seeded with 103 _10 4 eFU/ml of both bacteria and incubated in plastic bags. Bacterial survival was greatest at 4°e in both cattle and poultry slurry. For example, in poultry slurry, T90 values for E. coli were 156 days at 4°e compared to 6.9 and 1.9 days at 20 and 37°C respectively. Generally, studies that examined the effects oftemperature on pathogen survival in both slurry and solid waste showed that survival is greater at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, desiccation in the upper layers of the waste occurs more rapidly and explains why survival is longer at lower temperatures. Desiccation also occurs less quickly in slurries due to the proportion of liquid. Based on the results of Himanthongkham (1999; 2000), survival was generally greater in slurry environments than in solid manure.

The results of these studies could be used to create guidelines for holding times and

temperatures during storage for either liquid or solid waste. Based on the survival times shown, storage for a minimum length of time could significantly reduce the level of pathogenic organisms applied to land compared to the application of fresh waste.

4.1.3 Pathogen Survival in Soil
In some farm operations, pathogens will survive in stored wastes and there is a risk that these organisms could enter the soil environment following land application. Pathogen survival in soil after waste application becomes one of the controlling factors in determining the number of organisms available for transport to water sources (Reddy et al. 1981). The survival of pathogens in soil has been studied extensively. A number of factors such as soil type, moisture, temperature, pH and the antagonistic effects of indigenous microorganisms have all been shown to influence survivability. The studies reviewed demonstrate that pathogens can survive for extended periods in a variety of soil environments (see Appendix 4.3). Mawdsley et al. (1996b) determined protozoan survival in the soil environment. The objective of the study was to examine C. parvum transport in slurry following rainfall, but at the same time the study showed that C. parvum oocysts survive in soil cores for extended periods of time. The study was conducted on a constructed clay loam soil bed held on a 7.5% slope. 420 cm 3 of cow slurry were inoculated with 5 x 109 C. parvum oocysts and applied at a rate of 50m3lha onto vegetated soil24. Rainfall was simulated 24 hours after slurry application. After 70 days the soil was examined to determine the number of oocysts at various depths within the matrix. The majority of viable oocysts were found in the top 6 cm of the soil cores. For bacteria, Sjogren (1995) showed there was substantial persistence of E. coli in a rye-grass pasture. Sjogren (1995) determined that the majority of the E. coli (exact numbers were not given) survived for 41 days, but some of the bacteria that had penetrated the soil matrix remained on the pasture for 13 years. Similarly, Bolton et al. (1999) studied the survival of E. coli 0157:H7 in cattle manure applied to grassland. The bacteria were enumerated using two methods. The first method involved using a sterile spoon to remove one gram of the manure from the area. The sample

was diluted with a maximum recovery diluent (MRD), a mixture of sodium chloride and distilled water, and plated on a sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC). The plated sample was then incubated for 48 hours at 37°C. The second enumeration method involved the same dilution process, but the sample was plated on a Tryptic Soya Agar (TSA) and incubated for two hours at 37°C. The sample was then covered with SMAC and incubated again at 37°C for 48 hours. The survival rates were similar using both techniques. After 99 days, enumeration using the SMAC method on its own showed that the bacteria had declined from 7.1 x 107 CFU/g to 9.1 x
10 CFU/g. The SMAC/TSA enumeration method also showed a decline in bacteria from 2.9 x 10 CFU/g to 1.04 x 103 CFU/g. It was found that after 85 days, 70% ofthe soil samples

contained E. coli 0157:H7 and by 99 days that had been reduced to 20% of the samples. Overall, the study conducted by Bolton et al. (1999) showed that E. coli 0157:H7 can persist for considerable periods in the soil environment. Maule (1997) also investigated the ability of

E. coli 0157 to survive in soil. Viable numbers of the bacteria remained at 107 organisms/g of
soil after 130 days. An outbreak of E. coli infection among campers in Scotland led to a study that produced results very similar to Maule (1997). Ogden et al. (2002) investigated the survival of
E. coli 0157:H7 in pastureland after campers attending a scout camp became sick in May

2000. Investigations into the infection revealed that sheep had grazed on the site a few weeks earlier and, once tested, these sheep were found to be positive for E. coli OI57:H7. Heavy rainfall during the camp event resulted in localized flooding where mud and fecal material were abundant. It was determined that the route of transmission was likely via hands contaminated with mud. Ogden et al. (2002) then designed a study to determine the survival time of E. coli 0157: H7 in the pasture. The study determined E. coli survived for 105 days on that pasture. The authors noted that the date of shedding of the bacteria by the sheep was not certain and therefore the survival rate could be greater than the conservative calculation of 105 days. Soil type has been shown to be an important factor in bacteria survivability. Generally, the literature suggests that survival is enhanced in loam and clay soils due to the greater amounts of organic matter that they contain. Fenlon et al. (2000) studied the survivability of E. coli 0157:H7 in Scotland on sandy, loam and clay loam soils. This study applied tracer bacteria, not livestock waste, to the soils in plastic lined bins to a concentration of 106 E. colilg

of soil. The bins were exposed to ambient temperatures for six months, beginning in December. Results showed that sandy soil was least conducive to E. coli 0 157:H7 survival. The bacteria in sandy soils could not be detected after 56 days, whereas survival in loam and clay soils was over 175 days. Similar results were found when Zibilske and Weaver (1978) studied the survival of another bacterium, S. typhimurium, in clay and sandy loam soils. Salmonella were inoculated into fresh cattle slurry at a level of 1.5 x 104/g and spread onto clay and sandy soils held in glass containers. The effect of temperature was also investigated and the containers were held at 5, 22 or 39°C. Survival was greatest at 5°C, and in the clay loam soil. Conversely, Tamasi (1980) showed that sandy soils enhanced survivability of microorganisms. In Tamasi (1980) the effects oftemperature and soil type on survival and transport of E. coli and Salmonella were examined. Liquid manure was inoculated at a level of 9 x 105 CFU/ml of E. coli and 105 Salmonella organisms/ml. The manure was then applied at a rate of 57.67 m 3lha over garden soil and sandy soil that had been packed into 160 cm deep plastic tubes. Survival rates were determined by taking core samples at 10cm depths and identifying the bacteria. Survival was greater in the sandy soil at both 8 and 20°C. At 8°C, E. coli survival was 131 days in the sandy soil compared to 108 days in the garden soil. Salmonella also survived for 131 days in the sandy soil compared to 91 days in the garden soil at 8°C. Soil types have varying abilities to retain water. Clay and loam soils have been shown to retain water for longer periods of time compared to sandy soils (Young and Greenfield, 1923). Water content within the soil has been shown to be an important factor in bacterial survival. Ellis and McCalla (1978) stated that clay soils adsorb water more efficiently than sandy soils after rainfall and water protects microorganisms from desiccation. In a study conducted by Crane et al. (1980), it was noted that soil moisture not only contributed to greater survival rates of fecal coli forms but also supported their growth. Sjogren (1994) investigated the effects of temperature, moisture, and soil pH on the survival of E. coli in soil. The study was conducted in pots containing two sandy loam soils. One soil had an average pH of 6.8-8.3 and the other had a lower average pH of 5.5-7.2. The soils were inoculated at a level of 10 12 _10 13 CFU/g. The pots were incubated at four temperatures; 5, 10, 20 and 37°C and two moisture levels, at saturation and 15% saturation. In

(
total there were 48 pots inoculated for a period of 48 days. E. coli survival was greater in the pots that had been saturated. Similarly, Tannock and Smith (1971) studied the effects of moisture and desiccation on Salmonella survival in soil. 75cm 2 ryegrass-clover plots were contaminated with a Salmonella suspension applied at a rate of 108 Salmonellal25cm 2 · Moisture and desiccation were examined by studying plots that were exposed to direct sunlight and others that were not. Overall, when moisture evaporated from the soil due to direct sunlight, survival was reduced compared to survival in the shaded plots. As demonstrated by Tannock and Smith (1971), soil moisture is also related to temperature as well as soil type. The plots situated in direct sunlight experienced higher temperatures than those that were shaded and remained moist. Temperature has been shown to be an important factor in pathogen survivability. Results are consistent in studies that have examined temperature and suggest that lower temperatures are optimal for pathogen survival. For protozoa, Olson et al. (1999) studied the survival of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in autoclaved and unautoclaved soils at temperatures of -4, 4 and 25°C. C. parvum were shown to survive longest at the lowest temperature; 70 days in the sterile soil and greater than 84 days in the natural soil. Giardia. on the other hand, showed the greatest survival rates at 4"e for 45 days in both soil types compared to less than one week at-4"e. For bacteria, Gerba and McNabb (1981) suggested that at temperatures at or below 4"e, organisms could survive for months or years. This is in agreement with the results in Maule (1997). Maule (1997) found that E. coli 0 157:H7 was most stable in all media tested at 4"C. Zibilske and Weaver (1978) studied the survival of S. typhimurium in sand and clay soils at 5, 22 and 39"e. Survival was found to be greatest at lower temperatures in the clay soil. However, in the sandy soil survival was greatest at 22°C. Tamasi (1980) also investigated the effects of temperature on the survival of both Salmonella and E. coli, in garden soil and sand. Survival was always greatest at 8"e compared to 20°C, except in one instance. In the soil column containing Salmonella and sandy soil, survival was the same at 8 and 20°C, at 131 days. In the study conducted by Sjogren (1994) E. coli survival was consistently longer at the lower temperatures. In all ofthe 48 individual experiments, E. coli survival was hJfeater at 5 and 10"e compared to 20 and 37°C.

The results of Jiang et aI. (200 I) do not agree with the results of Sjogren (1994). In Jiang et al. (2001) survivability of E. coli 0157:H7 in autoclaved and unautoclaved soils was tested. In both soils survival was tested at 5, 15, and 21°C. Survival ofthe bacterium in both types of soil was shown to be longest at 21 "c. The authors note that this may be due to the slower processes of indigenous microorganisms at higher temperatures, and that at lower temperatures the competition of these microorganisms affects the survival of E. coli 0157:H7. The pH of soil has also been shown to affect bacterial survival in the soil environment. Cuthbert et al. (1950) observed enhanced fecal coliform survivability and growth and attributed it to a receptive neutral pH level in the soil. This observation was echoed by McFeters and Stuart (1972) who suggested a pH of6.0-7.0 was optimal for survival. Sjogren (1994) also demonstrated that viability of E. coli was greater in soils with a neutral pH. Rates of application, for both slurry and solid manure, are utilized in many manure management policies and regulations to control the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous applied to the land. Rates of application obviously affect the numbers of pathogens that could potentially be applied to land, but studies that have investigated application rate effects on pathogen survival have had conflicting results. Dazzo et al. (1973) observed an inverse relationship between die-off rates of bacteria and the rate of slurry application. Salmonella and fecal coliforms had a higher death rate in soils that had previously received zero or 1.27cm of slurry irrigation per week compared to soil samples which had received higher rates of slurry. These results agree with those of Mailman and Litsky (1951) who also concluded that increasing the organic content of soil, by increasing manure application, caused an increase in the survival of coliforms in the soil. Studies conducted by Crane et al. (1980) on the other hand, disagree. Crane et al. (1980) conducted experiments in laboratory soil columns and applied either 36.5 or 165 metric tons of manure per hectare on bare clay loam and sandy loam soils. The manure application rate did not influence the decline in fecal bacteria within the soil. Jiang et al. (2001) studied rates of manure application on E. coli 0157:H7 survival. Rates were determined by mixing one part manure with 10, 25, 50 or 100 parts soil. The study demonstrated that the more intensive application rate, one part manure to ten parts soil, resulted in a greater deactivation of E. coli 0157:H7 compared to lesser rates.

The antagonistic effects of indigenous microorganisms on the survival of pathogens in soil have been studied. The most common method for studying their effect is to compare pathogen survival in sterile soils that have been autoclaved with natural soils. Some studies suggest that survival is enhanced in autoclaved soils because of the absence of predation and competition from indigenous microorganisms, while other studies have shown that both bacteria and protozoa have persisted in natural soils. Jiang et at. (2002) mixed soils thoroughly with various amounts of manure and compared these samples to a soil that had been autoclaved. Results showed that the E. coli 0157:H7 declined more rapidly in the unautoclaved soil columns, likely due to the interactions ofthe pathogens with indigenous soil microorganisms. Conversely, Sjogren (1994) demonstrated that the soil used in lab microcosms with indigenous bacteria permitted the survival of E. coli. The study conducted by Olson et al. (1999) investigated this issue with respect to protozoa and had mixed results. The study analyzed the survivability of the protozoa in soil at temperatures of -4, 4 and 25°C, in autoclaved and unautoclaved soils. The study showed that autoclaved soil had no effect on the survivability of Giardia cysts but Cryptosporidium oocysts fared better in the absence of other microorganisms. Overall, under a variety of conditions, including various temperatures and soil types, pathogens have been shown to persist for long periods of time in soil environments. A review conducted by Winfield and Groisman (2003) suggests that survival of bacteria is enhanced in non-host environments that closely mimic mammalian host environments, such as in dark, moist surroundings. Although some studies have produced contradictory results, some general conclusions can be made. Lower temperatures, for example, support growth better than higher temperatures, as well as a neutral pH level and loamy clay soils. It must also be noted that although survival is greater in these environments, survival also occurs in less optimal conditions, for example, at low temperatures and in sandy soils. Therefore, the persistence of pathogens in a number of environments increases the risk of transport to sensitive areas where contamination can occur.

4.1.4 Pathogen survival in Water In some situations, pathogens will survive in soil environments after land application of livestock wastes. If survival persists until rainfall occurs, the risk of transport to ground and surface water sources is enhanced by percolation through soil or in runoff events. Once pathogens have reached water sources, their ability to survive increases the risk of drinking water contamination. In rural water supplies, ifpathogen survival occurs, the risk of waterborne illness is increased since supplies do not undergo treatment. Risk is also increased in water supplies that have been contaminated with hardy protozoa that are resistant to chlorination treatments. Studies have shown that pathogenic organisms can persist in various types of water sources, (see Appendix 4.4) including groundwater, surface waters and treated municipal water. A number of studies have examined di fferences in survival rates of pathogens in natural versus sterile water. In all but one study, results were consistent and found that survival was greater in sterile autoclaved water samples compared to natural water samples. To determine the survival of bacteria in water, Flint (1987) examined the survival of E.

coli inoculated at a level of 106 cells/ml into 100ml of filtered or natural river water. Water was
held at 4, 15,25, and 37°C. Results of the study were reported in T99 25values. A two-log reduction in E. coli had not been reached in the autoclaved water at the end of the 260 day study at 4 and 25°C. However, in the sterile water at 37°C, E. coli was reduced to the T 99 level in 60 days. Viability in the natural waters was drastically lower than the filtered water and viability decreased as temperatures increased. Wang and Doyle (1998) also studied the survival of E. coli 0157:H7. The bacteria were inoculated at a level of 103 CFU/ml into various water sources including autoclaved municipal water, reservoir water, and water samples from two recreational lakes. Survival was shown to be greatest in the autoclaved municipal water and least in the lake water. This study determined that E. coli were entering a viable but non-culturable state because the organisms could be detected by a direct viable count but could not be detected by enrichment in Typticase Soy Broth (TSB). This dormancy that organisms were entering is a means of protection for survival in harsh environments. The authors suggest that the E. coli cold survive in this state for much

longer than the 91-day study period and this shows the ability of E. coli to survive in water sources. The results of Rice and Johnson (2000) agree with the previous studies. Survival of E.
coli 0157:H7 was studied in water for dairy cattle26 · Two sources of water were studied; water

from a well that was then chlorinated and water from a surface source. Two grams of manure were added to the two litre water samples containing approximately 1.7 x 102 E. coli/mt. The samples were then stored in the dark for 16 days. At the end ofthe study, survival was greater in the chlorinated water samples where 1.7 E. coli/ml remained compared to less than 0.002 E.
coli/ml in the surface water sources.

McGee et at. (2002) also studied the survival of E. coli 0157:H7 in treated and untreated water in a number of settings, including outdoors with and without manure added, in a bam, and in a lab environment held at 15°C. Each experiment used five litres of water placed in a 10L sealed container. The water was then inoculated with either 103 or 106 E. coli/ml. Results showed that E. coli fared better in the autoclaved water in most settings and at both inoculation levels. Winfield and Groisman suggest that E. coli has a low rate of survivability outside its animal host, unless it is found in tropical water environments. These tropical waters provide high concentrations of nutrients and have constantly warm water and soil temperatures, thereby providing an optimal environment for survival and even growth. The authors suggest that survival is greatest in these environments due to the similarity to animal host environments. This study also shows that Salmonella survival in nonhost environments is greater than E coli survival. The study suggests that Salmonella have the ability to infect a number of hosts in their lifetime because they can survive outside of mammalian hosts in water and soil environments, increasing the probability of re-infection (Winfield and Groisman, 2003). Medema et al. (1997) studied both bacteria and protozoa survival in natural and autoclaved river water samples. Water samples were inoculated with either E. coli or C.
parvum at a level of 104 CFU/ml or 105 oocysts/ml, respectively. Die-off rates were greater in

the natural river water samples than in the filtered samples, for both organisms.

26

Although this study examines survival in water for cattle not drinking water, it is still valuable in that it shows substantial survival of E. coli.

Robertson et al. (1992) also studied C. parvum survival in both treated and untreated water. However, results disagree with the previously discussed studies and show that viability was the same in both river and filtered water samples. In both waters, one percent of the 2.8 x 107 oocysts that were inoculated into each sample remained viable after 176 days. Temperature has also been shown to be an important factor in pathogen survivability in water sources. Overall, studies have concluded that lower temperatures are more optimal for pathogen survival than higher temperatures which is consistent with the survival in manure and soil studies. For bacteria, Flint (1987) demonstrated that E. coli viability decreased as temperature increased from 4 to 37°C. The results from Terzieva and McFeters (1991) agree. E. coli survival was shown to be greater at 6°C than at 16°C in irrigation stream-water. At 6°C, the T90 value for the bacteria was 2.2 days whereas at 16°C it was only 1.3 days. Wang and Doyle (1998) also studied the survival of E. coli 0157:H7 in water held at 8, 15 and 25°C for a period of 91 days. The results demonstrated that survival was greatest at 8°C and least at 25°C. At 8°C E. coli was viable for over 91 days in all water samples. Rice and Johnson (2000) also confirmed that E. coli 0 157:H7 persists in water samples and that lower temperatures enhance pathogen survival. Die-off rates of E. coli were greater at 15°C compared to 5°C. Medema et al. (1998) studied both E. coli and Oyptosporidium survival in water at 5 and 15°C. Results showed that the survivability of both organisms is affected by temperature and that lower temperatures are more optimal for survival. This study also showed that Cryptosporidium oocysts are much more persistent in the water environment than E. coli. Protozoa survival in water at different temperatures was investigated by Olson et al. (1998). Survivability of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in sterile distilled water and -4, 4 and 25°C was examined. Cryptosporidium survival was greatest at -4°C, whereas Giardia survived longest at 4°C. Largely, the studies demonstrated that pathogenic organisms are capable of long periods of survival in the water environment. Overall, the rates of survival in manure, slurry, soil and water show that normal conditions in agricultural operations favour survivability. Survivability has been shown to be enhanced at lower temperatures but at all temperature levels it has been shown to occur. Similarly, in the soil environment survival is enhanced in

clay and loam soils but can occur in sandy soils as well. Nutrient management land application regulations do not address or include strategies to reduce pathogen survival; therefore if they are to effectively reduce the risk of waterborne contamination they must minimize the potential for pathogen transport.

4.2 Studies focusing on the Transport of Pathogens
The transport of pathogens is important because their ability to travel under various management practices and situations, coupled with their ability to survive in agricultural environments, increases the risk of water contamination and waterborne illness. In order to analyze the ability of the Ontario Nutrient Management Act regulations to control pathogens, an understanding of their ability to be transported and factors that affect their transport is required. The two primary modes of travel for pathogenic organisms include transport through the soil matrix (vertical) and horizontal transport over land in runoff. Both routes of transport have been taken by pathogens that have been implicated in waterborne disease outbreaks.

4.2.1 Vertical Transport in Soil
Mawdsley et al. (1996b) concluded that unless land is saturated or of an impermeable nature, vertical movement of microorganisms through the soil will occur when wastes are appl ied. The rate of vertical transport depends on the mechanisms of adsorption and filtration which govern transport of pathogens in the soil matrix. Both adsorption and filtration are influenced by soil type and organic matter, rainfall and soil, structure, as can be seen in the studies summarized in Appendix 4.5.

Soil Type
Soils function as protection zones over groundwater aquifers by filtering and adsorbing microorganisms thereby retaining them and reducing vertical transport. The soil's ability to tilter out microorganisms depends on its texture and pore space (Ellis and McCalla, 1978; Entry et al. 2000). Clays, for example, have the smallest particle size of any soil type at 0-2J..lm (Bitton and Gerba, 1984), whereas sand particles range from 50-1 OOJ..lm (Bitton and Gerba, 1984). When particles are smaller, they fit together better, reducing the spaces through which

organisms can travel. The porositl 7 of silts and clays is the largest at 50-60%, because there are so many minute spaces between the particles. Although there are a large number of spaces, they are usually too small to allow pathogens through. Bollag and Stotsky (1993) agree and state that the lower porosity (30-50%) of sandy soils allows deeper transport through soil layers. Clay's ability to retain microorganisms is also attributed to its higher organic matter content. Organic matter allows greater microorganism adsorption because it provides additional surfaces to which microorganisms can attach. The results of Smith et al. (1985) agree with these arguments. Smith et al. (1985) investigated E. coli transport in intact and disturbed soil columns with silt loam and sandy loam soils. A suspension of E. coli containing 107cellslml was applied over the soil columns and the columns were irrigated at a rate of 200mm/hr. The study concluded that E. coli was transported more efficiently in the intact soil columns but that transport and leaching also occurred in the disturbed soils at a lesser rate. Of the intact soil cores, the sandy loam cores permitted the highest rate of E. coli transport to 28cm. However, in all of the soil columns, the amount of E. coli contained in the leachate exceeded the Canadian Recreational Water Quality Guidelines of less than 100 organismsll OOml. The majority of the study findings suggest that the degree of adsorption is greater in clay soils compared to sandy soils. However, some studies suggest that other factors affect transport because they demonstrated greater transport in clay and loam soils. For bacteria, Tamasi (1981) showed that leaching was greatest in silty soils compared to sandy soils. Tamasi (1981) conducted a study examining the effect of soil type on the subsurface transport of E. coli and Salmonella. The organisms were seeded into liquid manure at a level of 105 Salmonellalml and 9 x 105 E. coli/ml. The manure was then applied at a rate of57.67 m 3lha over the garden and sandy soils that had been packed into 160cm long plastic tubes. Rainfall was simulated and it was shown that transport to 160cm occurred in all of the garden soil tubes but not all of the tubes containing sandy soils. Ogden et al. (1999) also investigated bacterial transport in contrasting soil types. This study investigated E. coli transport in 600m2 grassland plots in clay loam, silty clay loam and

sandy loam soils. This investigation also examined various application rates on soils, 40tlha was applied to the clay loam soils, SOtlha to the silty clay loam soils and 30t/ha was applied to the sandy loam soils. E. coli inoculation levels were also different for all soil types making it difficult to analyze the effect of soil type on transport. However, it was concluded that some soil types hinder the transport of bacteria but, in rainfall events transport can occur regardless of soil type. This was shown in the clay and silty clay loam soils, where rainfall events resulted in transport to lysimeter pans, whereas rainfall did not occur over the sandy loam plot and transport to the lysimeter was less than the other plots. For protozoa, Mawdsley et al. (1996a) studied the transport of C. parvum in intact soil cores to examine pathogen transport in differing soil types. C. parvum, at a level of 1 x lOR, was applied directly onto 30cm deep soil cores of silt loam, loamy sand, and clay loam. The study showed that transport was greater in the silty loam and clay loam soils compared to the sandy soil. Rainfall Bitton et al. (1974) stated that bacterial movement should be insignificant when soils are below field capacity moisture levels and that the risk oftransport should increase when rainfall occurs. The contamination that transport due to rainfall can cause was experienced first-hand in Walkerton in May 2000 when higher-than-normal rainfall provided a mechanism for the transport of land-applied pathogen-laden manure. Intense rainfall not only creates runoff but also creates turbulent flow through soil macropores that can dislodge microorganisms that were adsorbed within the soil matrix (Crane and Moore, 1984). Results of the study conducted by Fenlon et al. (2000) agree and concluded that rainfall aided in transport of E. coli to tile drains. In this study, dairy slurry containing 5.3 x 104 E. coli/ml was applied at a rate of 19.6m3/ha to a clay loam plot. Natural rainfall occurred between the third and seventh days following application. These rain events permitted 7% of the E. coli that had been applied to leach into the tile drains. Although the percentage seems low, 7% of the initial inoculation level equals 3.7 x 1030rganisms/mi which exceed recreational water quality guidelines. Fenlon et al. (2000) concluded that following application to land, the bacteria had adsorbed to the soil in the subsurface but were then 'flushed' through the matrix as a result of the rainfall.

Both Tamasi (198]) and Abu-Ashour et a1. (] 998) also concluded that intense rainfal1s increased transport of E. coli and the greatest transport events took place after heavier rainfal1s. Tamasi (1981) also noted that normal agricultural rainfal1 did not lead to transport to deep soil layers. Gagliardi and Karns (2000) also simulated rainfal1 events over intact and disturbed soil columns to determine the transport of fresh manure and E. coli 0157:H7 in three soil types. Fresh manure inoculated with E. coli was spread over disturbed and intact soil cores of silty clay and sandy loams. A rainfal1 rate of 25.4mm over a 4 hour period was applied daily for 4 days and then every fourth day until the end of the ] 8 day study. The rainfal1 events led to moist soils and high levels of bacterial growth resulted. The results showed that the rainfall increased transport and, in al1 but one soil core, higher levels of E. coli were found in the leachate than were initial1y applied in the manure. Overal1 studies have shown that rainfal1 events increase transport opportunities for pathogens. Many nutrient management policies regulate the timing of waste application onto land based on weather forecasts. However, the fact that organisms can survive for extended periods of time in soil environments allows them to remain viable within the soil matrix until rainfall events occur. Soil Structure Many nutrient management policies encourage or require tillage or incorporation of manure directly into the soil in order to remove manure from the soil surface and reduce risk of runoff. Tillage and incorporation also disturb macropores and minimize the risk of rapid transport through the soil matrix. Macropores are large, readily visible continuous openings in field soils (Beven and Germann, 1982). These openings can be continuous for several meters in both vertical and horizontal directions. Macropores are formed in agricultural land by soil fauna, plant roots, cracks and fissures (Beven and Germann, 1982). The soil's ability to retain microorganisms, manure and water is reduced when macropores are present and preferential water flow is strong. A study conducted by Vervoort et a1. (200]) reinforces the importance of macropores in solute movement. The study used a blue-dye to follow infiltration in silt loam plots. After rainfall, maximum percolation depth in the no-til1 soil was more than double the tilled fields.

The tracer in the no-till fields reached a depth of 364.8mm while the tracer in the tilled field reached 131 mm. A number of studies have also been conducted on the effects of tillage on pathogen transport (see Appendix 4.6). In Smith et al. (1985), the transport of E. coli through intact and disturbed soil columns was investigated. Soil structure was related to the transport of the bacteria and E. coli moved rapidly through the intact soils. When channels and pores were removed by mixing the soil in the columns, soils became more effective bacterial filters. An E.

coli suspension containing 10 7cells/ml was applied to the soil columns at a rate of20mm/hr for
10 hours. Disturbed cores retained at least 93% of the cells applied, whereas the intact cores retained only 21-78% of the bacteria. The transport in the intact soil cores shows that the absorptive and retentive abilities of soil are limited when macropores exist. Abu-Ashour et al. (1998) also studied the effect of macroporosity on E. coli transport in saturated and unsaturated conditions in silt loam and loam soils. Experiments were conducted in the lab where soils were mixed and macropores were created artificially. A 35ml E. coli suspension containing 106 _1 O,oCFU/ml was applied to each soil column. Results showed that greater amounts of the E. coli consistently passed through the soil columns where macropores had been created. The results produced by McMurry et al. (1998) also suggest that tilled soils have a greater ability to retain fecal bacteria. In this study, poultry manure was spread on silt loam soil blocks at a rate of one tonne per hectare and rainfall was simulated at a rate of 7cm per hour for 36 hours. In no-till soils, 2.8 x 10 CFUIl OOml were found in the leachate after 8cm ofrain. In the tilled soils, 2 x 10 CFUIl OOml were found in the leachate only after 22 hours of rainfall had occurred. The authors suggest that contamination of groundwater can occur in only a modest rainfall in soils that are not tilled. It was also demonstrated that although tillage retarded preferential movement, it did not prevent leaching of the bacteria. Gagliardi and Karns (2000) also noted that tillage retarded but did not prevent transport of bacteria through soil cores. E. coli 0 157:H7 transport was examined in intact and disturbed soil cores of silt, clay, and sandy loam. Cattle manure that had been inoculated with 3.0 x
10 CFU/ml was applied at a rate of 6.12t/ha onto the intact soil cores. On disturbed soil cores,

manure inoculated with bacteria at 4.7 x 10 CFU/ml, was applied at the same rate. Rainfall was simulated at a rate of 25.4mm per day for four days and then every fourth day until the end of

the 18 day study. E. coli was found in the leachate from both the tilled and no-till cores. Leachate from the intact silt loam cores contained more E. coli than from the disturbed cores, however, leachate from the disturbed clay and sand cores contained more E. coli than the intact cores. In most leachate, the amount of E. coli removed was greater than the initial inoculum level; therefore the authors concluded that growth had also occurred. The increased amount of

E. coli in the leachate of the disturbed cores may indicate that disruption and slower transport
allows for more growth opportunity within the soil matrix. Stoddard et aI. (1998) also studied the effect of tillage on bacterial transport. Dairy manure had been applied at rates between 8.6 and 15.9t/ha on silt loam fields, one that had been tilled and one that had not over the two-year study. Lysimeters were installed in the fields at a depth of90cm to monitor for fecal bacteria in the leachate. Rain was not simulated but after the first natural rainfall, fecal coli forms were found in the Iysimeter pans in both fields. The average amount of indicator organisms in the Iysimeter pans of the tilled and no-till fields were not significantly different, and averaged 3 x 103 FCII OOml. The results of the Stoddard et al. (1998) study are similar to those found in the research conducted by Wall et al. (1998). This study also concluded that tillage did not result in a significant difference in the levels of bacteria in tile drain waters. Wall et al. (1998) studied the vertical transport of E. coli, inoculated into liquid swine manure (the inoculation level not given). The manure was applied to tile-drained fields under three application methods; surface applied, modified injection, and conventional injection28 · Overall, results showed no significant difference in the levels of bacteria that reached the tile drains (at depths of 0.87, 0.80, and 0.67m) under any of the three application methods. In every experiment, bacteria levels were significantly greater than the Guidelines for Canadian Recreational Water Quality of 102 organisms per 100ml.

4.2.2 Pathogen Transport in Runoff
After land application of livestock wastes, a large amount of organic matter and microorganisms remain on the soil surface and within the top 1cm of the soil (Gerba et al. 1975). This increases the likelihood of contamination during runoff events.

2~ Although this study focuses on application method, it is included in this section because modified injection

involves minor cultivation prior to injection of waste. Therefore the effects of tillage are also investigated.

McCoy and Hagedorn (1979) studied both vertical and horizontal transport of tracer strains of E. coli in silty clay loam tields on a 14% slope. A SOOml suspension containing lOhcells/ml of tracer bacteria was injected intothe soil at 3 depths that corresponded to the A, 8, and C horizons

in the soil. Piezometers 30 were situated at various lengths and depths

downfield from the application site to measure distance traveled. The deepest point measured was 200cm and the farthest distance measured was 20.5m. Tracer bacteria traveled 20.5m horizontally through the soil and were found as deep as 150cm. Abu-Ashour and Lee (2000) also investigated transport of tracer strains of E. coli. In their study, transport on clay loam at a 2% slope and a 6% slope was investigated. Forty litres of water containing 2 x 10 12 CFU was spread onto both plots. Two days after application, heavy rainfalls occurred. Results showed that transport was greater on the steeper slope. The bacteria from the 6% slope traveled 35m downslope, at this distance runoff contained 16 CFU/ml. On the gentler slope, bacteria were transported 20m and runoff water at this distance contained IS CFU/ml. Protozoan transport in runoff has also been studied. Mawdsley et al. (l996b) investigated horizontal and vertical transport of C. parvum on a sloping surface. The objective of the study was to examine to what extent C. parvum in slurry are transported following rainfall on a 7.5% slope. C. parvum oocysts were mixed into cow slurry and the mixture was applied at a rate of 50m 3/ha. At this rate, 1.7 x 10 oocysts per soil block were applied. Rainfall was simulated 24 hours after slurry application. Runoff occurred immediately and oocysts continued to be detected in runoff for 21 days (no levels were given). At the end of the study, the soil blocks were examined to determine oocyst location. At the farthest point from the application site, a distance of 70cm, no oocysts were found in the soil cores. The authors suggest this implies that once oocysts are contained in an aqueous solution, they don't precipitate out and settle onto the soil surface. The authors note that if the study had been

The A horizon of the soil is the top layer, usually no deeper than 20cm. This layer is the most fertile because of the organic matter than accumulates in it and the biological activity that takes place due to the root density in this layer. The B horizon is the layer directly below the A horizon, known as subsoil. The subsoil is lighter in colour because less organic matter and humus is contained in it. Subsoil is denser than the upper layer and fewer plant roots penetrate into it. The C horizon is the layer below the subsoil called 'parent material'. The C horizon contains material that has been around for a long time, as opposed to the organic matter and humus that accumulates and creates the A horizon. This layer usually contains clay and gravel. .10 Instruments used to measure pore water pressure in soil or rock.

conducted over a longer distance, runoff would still contain a number of oocysts because of their ability to remain in the aqueous solution. Tate et a1. (2000) also studied the transport of Cryptosporidiunl oocysts in runoff over pasture. The objective of the study was not to demonstrate distance traveled but to determine the strength of runoff tlow on slopes of 10, 20 and 30%. 200 gram fecal pats were inoculated with I0 00cysts/g and placed on each slope. After rainfall, runoff was measured one meter downslope from the fecal pat. Strength of the flow was demonstrated by the number of oocysts that were contained in the runoff from the slopes and it was demonstrated that slope had a significant effect of the number of oocysts contained in the runoff On the 10% slope, 112 oocysts/l were found in the runoff, whereas on the 20% slope, 2.5 x 10 oocysts/l were found. The velocity of runoff on the steeper slope flushed oocysts from the fecal pats.

Vegetated Buffer Zones
The construction of vegetated butfer zones surrounding water sources is a common water quality protection measure that has been adopted or encouraged by a number of nutrient management policies because they are a practical, low-cost means of improving runoff water quality (Edwards et al. 1996). The primary function of a vegetated buffer zone is to control soil erosion and runoff intensity. Vegetated buffer strips function by promoting filtration of soluble pollutants and the deposition of sediment. This is accomplished by the slowdown of runoff when it enters the buffer and the adsorption of pollutants to surfaces of plants within the butfer. Appendix 4.8 shows the details of studies that have been conducted on the effectiveness of vegetated buffer zones with respect to microorganism control. Young et al. (1980) evaluated the ability of filter strips to reduce pollutants in runoff from feedlot areas. Although this study investigated feedlot runoff, not runoff from land applied with livestock waste, it is important because it shows that total nitrogen and phosphorous within the runoff were controlled more effectively than fecal and total coli forms. Heavy rainfall events were simulated over a 4% sloping area that ran from inside to outside the feeding area. It was shown that the 27m buffer strip reduced the amount of both total coliforms and fecal coliforms by 69% compared to the reduction of total Nand P by 84 and 83% respectively. A reduction of 69% resulted in a level of 2.79 x

fecal coliforms remaining in the runoff after it had moved through the buffer strip. The authors suggest that a 36m buffer would be adequate to reduce bacteria in runoff to acceptable levels. Walker et al. (1990) modeled animal waste management practices and their impacts on bacteria levels in runoff from agricultural lands. One of the practices modeled was the use of vegetated buffer strips. The models calculated bacteria concentrations in runoff that resulted from a rainfall event that occurred after manure application. The overal1 conclusion was that buffer strips alone were not adequate for reducing bacteria concentrations to levels that would meet water quality standards. The model tested a 30.5m buffer strip on a 3% slope and determined that if 2.2tlha of manure inoculated with 400 fecal coliforms/g was applied to a silt loam field, the buffer would be inadequate in reducing fecal coliform concentrations to acceptable water quality standards. Al1 water samples from the study were found to contain greater than 102 fecal coliformsll OOml. Both Chaubey et al. (1994) and Coyne et al. (1995) showed that vegetated buffer strips control nutrients and sediments more effectively than fecal bacteria. Chaubey et al. (1994) evaluated the effectiveness of filter strips in retaining swine manure constituents including fecal coIiforms and suspended solids. A series of buffer lengths were tested (3, 6,9,15 and 21 m) after 200kg of N/ha of manure was applied and rainfal1 at a rate of 50mm/hr was simulated. Results showed that the effectiveness of the buffer strip in retaining total suspended solids was 61 %. Fecal coliform retention was slightly less at 58% and even at the 21 m distance a concentration of 15.2 x 104 CFU/100ml of fecal coliforms remained in the runoff. Similarly, Coyne et al. (1995) also investigated soil and fecal coliform retention by filter strips after simulated rain events. Poultry manure mixed with bedding from a laying facility was incorporated into a silt loam field and heavy rainfall was simulated over the application area but not over the buffer strip. The trapping efficiency of a 3m buffer strip was estimated. It was found that a 3m buffer was effective at trapping 99% of sediment loads but only 74% of fecal coIiforms. The study does not give the inoculation level of the fecal coliforms; therefore it is uncertain whether trapping 74% of fecal coliforms is adequate to achieve water quality standards. The authors note that rainfall was applied over the buffer strip, therefore their estimates of trapping efficiency may be high because, if water had been applied over the strip, there would have been more water to retain a higher number of fecal coliforms.

Lim et al. (] 998) studied the effect of a vegetated buffer on the removal of fecal coli forms after cattle manure was applied to a silt loam field. Manure inoculated at a level of 2 x ] 0 7 fecal coli formsll OOml was applied at a rate of 60kg Nlha. Lim et al. (1998) determined that fecal coliform concentrations in runoff were reduced to zero after runoff moved through a 6.1 m buffer with 100% cover. A study conducted by Entry et al. (2000) found that vegetated buffers were not adequate at retaining fecal bacteria. In this study swine lagoon wastewater containing both fecal and total coli forms was applied at a rate of 86. 7m 3lha over a series of 30m long riparian filter-strips with differing amounts and types of vegetative cover. The study concluded that despite the presence of vegetation, levels of bacteria in wastewater did not decline significantly as the water moved through the strips. It was determined that fecal and total coliforms were reduced by 2.0-3.0 logs in the 30m buffer. Based on the number of bacteria that were initially applied, these reductions would not be adequate to meet water quality standards (see Appendix 4.8). For protozoa, Atwill et al. (2002) studied the transport of c,yptosporidium oocysts in a fluorescent assay through vegetated buffer strips to determine their filtration efficiency. The objective of the study was to assess the assumption that placing a vegetated buffer strip between farmland and water sources will strain or adsorb microorganisms as they move through the buffer. The study demonstrated that buffers were more effective at removing C. parvum when constructed with silty clay or loam soils than with sandy soils. Atwill et al. (2002) concluded that a 3m buffer should remove up to 99% of C. parVllm oocysts when low to moderate precipitation occurs. It must be noted that Atwill et al. (2002) suggested that ifhigher degrees of rainfall occurred, a larger vegetated buffer strip would be required. Largely, these studies demonstrate that pathogens have the ability to be readily transported through vegetated areas. These studies also suggest that inadequate bacterial removal could cause contamination of water sources even though adequate practices for soil erosion and nutrient control are in place because sediments and pathogens are transported differently. Oocysts, cysts, and E. coli bacteria typically have a net-negative surface charge which disallows them to strongly absorb to negatively-charged organic matter and clay minerals. When soils are transported by runoff into vegetated buffers, the' cl umps' of soil are

disaggregated when they collide with the vegetation of the buffer (Walker et al. 1990). This disaggregating of micro and macro aggregates releases the pathogens from the soil particles because the sorption is weak and the microorganisms are free to continue to travel in an aqueous solution without binding to other particles. This weak sorption, coupled with the fact that the size ofthese microorganisms allows their further transport, increases their ability to travel through filter strips. The ability to travel through vegetated filters is enhanced by their ability to survive for long periods of time, therefore, although the rate of travel is reduced in the buffer strip pathogens can survive long enough to travel through it.

4.3 Gaps in the Evidence
There are a number of gaps that need to be addressed regarding the ability to use the results of these studies to assess the effectiveness of nutrient management policies on controlling pathogens in agricultural operations. Overall, there is a lack of research on this topic. There are few studies that have been conducted on pathogen survival and transport in agricultural operations. Most studies that investigate the effects of waste application onto land have focused on nitrogen and phosphorous. The limited information available suggests that there is a gap in the knowledge of this issue. However, in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in pathogen contamination due to a number of waterborne-disease outbreaks that have occurred in the United States and Canada. In the transport studies that were reviewed, all but one of the experiments were conducted using simulated rainfall if natural rainfall did not occur or was not possible. Transport has been shown to be enhanced during rainfall. However, this leaves a gap in the knowledge regarding the risk of contamination and the ability of pathogens to move through and over soils in the absence of rainfall. Many policies and guidelines recommend application during periods of dry weather and therefore the risk of land application under this situation should also be investigated. The studies reviewed were conducted between 1974 and 2002.This time frame suggests that the available technologies and methods for pathogen enumeration as well as preparation

"

methods are likely different. For example, Fenlon et a1. (2000) noted that the type of selective agent chosen for isolating pathogens is important because it can be inhibiting to some strains and not to others. Therefore, some estimates of viability could be low if an unsuitable agent was used. If every study had used the same instruments and methods, it is likely that the results of some studies may have been different. All of these studies were conducted by inoculating manure with a set rate of one of the pathogens in order to control the number in the fecal material and the number that were then applied to the soils. Most of the experiments used a variety of rates of inoculation and therefore the amounts recovered in the leachate and soil samples are difficult to compare. It is also difficult to determine the number of pathogens that will actually be contained in the manure and will be spread on land in an agricultural operation. What can be noted is that all studies suggest that the inoculation amounts used are similar to average shedding rates that have been calculated for variously infected animals. Most studies that investigated the ability of pathogens to travel either in the subsurface or over land, controlled the distances at which the pathogens were measured. This shows that pathogen transport is possible, but leaves a gap as to the true ability of pathogens to travel, and these distances are unfortunately sometimes determined only after water has been contaminated. For example, no studies have examined long distance pathogen transport, hundreds of meters or more, despite the fact that in many waterborne disease outbreaks pathogens have traveled these distances. In the case of the Walkerton waterborne disease outbreak, the manure that was implicated in the outbreak traveled a few hundred meters from the field where it was applied to the well that it contaminated (O'Connor, 2002). These studies have investigated one manure handling approach at a time. Under real circumstances, agricultural operators would utilize a series of management practices to handle livestock waste and reduce the risk of contamination. For example, by the time wastes are land-applied, they have been collected, stored and transported. During this series of events, microorganisms may be growing or dying within the waste. An understanding of the risk of water contamination from land application is limited when the entire manure handling process is not taken into consideration. No study has traced the fate of pathogens within waste through a whole agricultural operation. Studies designed to track microorganism survival from the time of shedding to land application and then track transport would be difficult to design and

conduct, but would also be very meaningful. In the meantime, research focusing on pathogen transport and survival in one agricultural environment, for example waste in storage or soil, is important in the understanding of pathogen control and the actions necessary to reduce the risk of water contamination of these microorganisms.

4.4 Conclusions
Investigations have shown that pathogens have the ability to survive in environments common in agricultural operations and can be transported significant distances through soil and in runoff. Despite the lack of information or the differences in design of the studies, for example field vs. laboratory studies, the information that these studies has provided helps to understand the extent to which microorganisms can survive and move under these situations. Pathogen survival in storage and in the soil environment is enhanced at lower temperatures. However, despite the fact that survival is greater at lower temperatures, it has been shown to occur for significant periods of time in environments up to 35"C, temperatures that could be reached in the environment. Similarly, the studies showed that survival is enhanced in clay and loam soils compared to sandy soils. Again, although survival is greater in clay and loam environments, it has been shown to be substantial in sandy soils as well. Many of the studies determined the optimal conditions for pathogen survival; however, pathogens were shown to survive for extended periods of time in conditions that were less than optimal as well. This ability of bacteria and protozoa to survive in nonhost environments shows the microorganisms' ability to adapt ,to new environments that are not as optimal for survival and proliferation as were their animal host environments. The mechanisms that affect microorganism transport were shown to be different than nutrient transport after land application of livestock wastes. Pathogens were shown to be transported greater distances than nutrients attached to soil particles. The ability of pathogens to survive and be transported differently than nutrients and sediments in agricultural environments suggests that an analysis of specific regulations within a nutrient management policy should be conducted. This analysis will examine whether pathogens are controlled effectively under common nutrient management guidelines or

Chapter Five: Pathogen Control using Nutrient Management Policy: NMA Regulations and Scientific Conclusions
The objective of this research is to detennine the pathogen abatement effects of nutrient management policy, in particular the Ontario Nutrient Management Act (2002), by assessing the regulations' ability to control pathogen transport and survival. The assessment is based on existing scientific studies that have been conducted in agricultural environments or for the purposes of mimicking agricultural environments in a laboratory setting, therefore no in-field research has been conducted and analysis is based on the findings available in these studies. By developing an understanding of pathogen abatement effects, an assessment can be made of the degree of protection that is made available by the nutrient management regulations. The regulations that were specifically analyzed within the Ontario Nutrient Management Act (2002) include those that focus on controlling and preventing the horizontal and vertical transport of waste once applied to land. These regulations include established minimum separation distances between surface waters and wells under a variety of conditions, the use of vegetated buffer zones, and the prevention of preferential flow to groundwater, bedrock and tile drains. Part of this analysis involves an investigation of the distance traveled by pathogens and their ability to move under various management conditions, such as tilled versus non-tilled soils. Another factor is the concentration of organisms that travel these distances. The initial concentration of organisms is important to detennine the quality of the resulting runoff and leachate, given that 100% die-off of the pathogens is not likely. The Guidelines for Canadian Recreational Water Quality (1992) were used as the requirements in this analysis. Standards for recreational water quality were used since the water resulting from tile drains or runoff will obviously not be used as drinking water. Therefore the allowable concentrations of Escherichia coli in recreational water are a geometric mean of < 100 E. coli per 100 millilitres based on a minimum of five samples taken over a period of30 days (Robertson, 2003). Will Robertson (2003) of Health Canada indicated in conversation that there are no specific measures for Salmonella and noted that when water is measured for E. coli, Salmonella is also implicitly

.'

measured due to their relationship32. c,yptosporidium and Giardia are also without specific water quality standards due to the difficulty and cost of their measurement. Detection of
c,yptosporidium and Giardia requires large amounts of water and there is no efficient method

for determining whether the oocysts and cysts that are detected are actually viable (Robertson, 2003). For the purposes of this research, the standard of <100 organisms per 100 millilitres of water was used for all pathogens studied; therefore, ifleve1s of pathogens greater than this standard were found in runoff water, leachate water or tile drains, the water was considered to be contaminated. If contamination was found to occur in experiments conducted under permitted conditions based on the regulations, it indicates that pathogens can survive and be transported under the conditions set out in the Nutrient Management Act.

5.1 Vegetated Buffer Zones
Section 1.1 of the Nutrient Management Act, 2002, defines a vegetated buffer zone as an area that,
a) Has a width ofat least 3m, adjacent to sUI:face water, measuredfi·om the top of the bank of the surface water nearest the buffer zone; and b) Is maintained under continuous vegetated cover.

Based on the studies regarding the effectiveness of vegetated buffer zones (shown in Appendix 4.8), a zone with a width of 3 meters would be inadequate to control the movement of pathogenic organisms because high levels of pathogenic organisms were found to be transported up to 30m from their point of application through buffer zone materials. Seven studies were reviewed; of the seven studies, six recommended a vegetated buffer zone width of greater than 3 meters in order to obtain primary contact water quality standards. The study conducted by Atwill et al. (2002), was the only study that showed the regulations of the Nutrient Management Act to be adequate in controlling c,yptosporidium
parvum. Atwill et al. (2002) concluded that 99.9% of c,yptosporidium oocysts would be

captured in a three meter wide buffer if runoff occurred during a low-to-medium sized rainfall event. It should also be noted that although this was the study conclusion, the authors suggested a buffer strip of 3-7 meters in width to account for higher intensity rainfall events.

32 Studies have shown that generally, water samples containing high concentrations of fecal coliforms will likely also contain Salmonella.

The remainder of the studies (Entry et al. 2000; Coyne et al. 1995; Young et al. 1980; Lim et at. 1998; Chaubey et at. 1994 and Walker et at. 1990) generally found that buffer zones in the range from 6.1 meters to 35.44 meters are required to bring runoff water to acceptable primary contact standards for fecal coliforrns and Escherichia coli. The study conducted by Entry et al. (2000) is the only one that measured transport of total coliforrns and fecal coli forms during a period without rainfall. Despite the dry conditions, the bacteria were able to move 15 meters through the buffer zone when applied in swine lagoon wastewater at a rate of 86. 7m 3fha. The slope at the site was not excessive but ranged from 1.5-2.0% and therefore this application rate would have been acceptable under the Nutrient Management Act. Based on the existing evidence, a buffer zone following the specifications under the Nutrient Management Act, will not adequately prevent the transport of pathogenic and indicator organisms in runoff water as it travels through the buffer based on levels of inoculation that are consistent with average shedding rates of infected livestock. The results shown in Appendix 4.8 also demonstrate that vegetated buffer zones, as they are defined under some of the other policies reviewed, are also likely inadequate for pathogen control. For example, the Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural Activity Code in Scotland and the Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Production of Water in England both require vegetated buffer zones with a width often meters around surface sources adjacent to agricultural land. However, based on the conclusions about transport shown in five out of the seven studies reviewed, a 10 meter buffer zone would not succeed in meeting primary water contact standards.

5.2 Vertical Transport and the Prevention of Preferential Flows
There are three sections of the Nutrient Management Act (2002) regulations that are intended to reduce the risk preferential flow and vertical transport of wastes through the subsurface soil environment, including Section 6.4 that deals with tile drainage, Section 6.11 which deals with minimum depth to bedrock, and Section 6.12 dealing with minimum depth to groundwater. Section 6.4 of the Nutrient Management Act, 2002, Prevention of Preferential Flows to Tile Drains states:

flit is not possible to monitor the tile drainage system, no person shall app~v a liquid prescribed material or non-agricultural source material to the land unless, a) The land has been tilled within the period of 7 days before application; or b) The rate of application is less than 40m 3/ha.
It is assumed tillage produces reductions in pathogen concentrations in leachate. This

regulation relies on the disturbance of macropores, rate of application, and the filtration properties of soil to prevent vertical pathogen transport. To analyze the effect of this regulation, studies should have applied liquid prescribed materials at rates less than 40 cubic meters per hectare or have tilled the cropland within seven days prior to application. Based on these requirements, not all studies summarized in Appendices 4.5 and 4.6 can be utilized. For example, Mawdsley et al. (1996b) cannot be used in the analysis of these regulations because the study was conducted on intact soil cores and the application rate of cattle slurry exceeded
40m 3 /ha. It must be noted that depths of tile drains differ in various agricultural operations based on

soil, topography, and hydrology of the land. In Ontario, the minimum permitted depth of soil over tile drains is 600mm but can be as little as 500mm under certain circumstances; the average depth of tile drains in Ontario is roughly 750mm (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 1997). Generally, tiles drains are constructed at shallower depths in clay soils and deeper in lighter soils. Of the studies that are relevant in this regulation, there are conflicting conclusions regarding the effects of tillage and rates of application on vertical transport of pathogens to tile drains. Patni et al. (1984) showed that transport to depths of 80cm by fecal bacteria is possible, but the concentration of fecal bacteria in the tile drainage water was below the maximum acceptable concentration (MAC), based on primary water contact standards. However, the concentration levels in the tile waters did reach unacceptable levels and were not continuously below the MAC. At times, levels reached as high as 2.8 x 104 organisms per milliliter, but based on the geometric mean of all samples taken, this study showed that the filtration properties of soil, combined with a 40m 3 /ha application rate or tillage of the field to prevent preferential flows, is adequate at controlling the transport of bacteria. Conversely, vertical transport of bacteria was shown to be significant in Fenlon et al. (2000), Ogden et al. (2001), McMurry et al. (1998), Wall et al. (1998), Stoddard et al. (1998)

and Patterson et al. (1974). The concentration of organisms found in the leachate water or tile drain water in these studies exceeded the MAC despite controlled rates of application for liquid prescribed materials below 40m 3/ha and/or tillage prior to application. For example, Wall et al. (1998) studied transport to tile drains on three sites at depths of 0.87m, 0.80m, and 0.67m and found concentrations of E. coli at 1.33 x 1061l00ml, 5.0 x 103/100ml, and 1.22 x 1051l00ml respectively, and Patterson et al. (1974) found similar concentrations of 3.6 x 105/100ml at a depth of 1.5m. Stoddard et al. (1998) investigated the transport of fecal colifonns (FC) in tilled and no-tilled fields. The researchers found no significant difference in the FC concentrations in Iysimeter pans at a depth of 90cm where concentrations averaged 3 x 103 FCIl OOml. The study conducted by Tamasi (1981) also follows the requirements of these regulations and shows transport to a depth of 1.6 meters for both E. coli and Salmonella. However, levels of concentration at this depth are not given, therefore, it cannot be said whether this study shows regulations would be adequate at controlling pathogen transport. Studies conducted by McCoy and Hagedorn (1979) and Rothmaier et al. (1997) show significant transport of E. coli at concentrations exceeding the MAC to depths of 150cm and 50cm respectively. These studies were conducted using an E. coli suspension instead of livestock slurry or manure, therefore the effects of organic matter in manure are not accounted for and rates of application of manure do not exist. Nonetheless, these studies are valuable because they show that bacterial transport was substantial. Based on the existing evidence, it can't be stated with certainty whether the requirements of Section 6.4 are adequate to inhibit pathogens from reaching tile drains, but the majority (all but one) of the studies that were conducted under NMA specifications (Section 6.4) do show that bacterial levels are exceeded under the circumstances specified. As well, other studies show significant vertical transport to depths at which tile drains could be located; these studies, however, were not discussed specifically in this section because they did not comply with the requirements of Section 6.4; for example, either the application rates were too high, fields were not tilled, or whether the fields were tilled is not given.

Section 6.11 Minimum Depth to Bedrock Section 6.11 (2) of the NMA, 2002, states that no one can apply agricultural materials if the depth of the soil over bedrock is less than 150cm. If that is the case, operators must follow the application specifications set out in Table 4.

The regulations in this section are based on the depth of the soil over bedrock and the type of waste being applied. Again the two mechanisms used to control transport are tillage and rate of application. To analyze the potential outcomes of this regulation, studies had to

confonn to the specifications laid out in Table 5.1. Of the studies reviewed, four studies were conducted within the specifications. Based on the evidence, all four studies show that the regulations would be inadequate in controlling pathogens in the subsurface soil environment (see Appendices 4.5 and 4.6). Patterson et al. (1974), McMurry et al. (1998), Stoddard et al. (1998) and Wall et al. (1998) demonstrated that the tillage and rate of application requirements in Section 6.11 of the Nutrient Management Act, 2002, may be inadequate at controlling pathogen transport. Firstly, Patterson et al (1974) applied slurry at a rate of 46m 3lha on a ploughed field; this is pennitted when depth of soil over bedrock is at least 60cm to 1.5m. Under this circumstance, they found bacterial transport to 1.5m and water with concentrations of 3.6 x 10 51I OOml fecal colifonns at that depth, therefore water within the bedrock zone could have become contaminated. McMurry et al. (1998) also within the Act's requirements, applied solid poultry manure at a rate of 10 tonnes per hectare over both tilled and no-till fields. When applying solid manure under Section 6.11, there is a maximum of 45t1ha pennitted at a depth of soil over bedrock of 15-30cm. They showed vertical transport of fecal bacteria to 42.5cm with concentrations of 2.3 x 10711 OOml in the no-till fields. The tilled fields retained the bacteria for a longer period of time but did not prevent it from traveling vertically. After 22 hours, the leachate in the tilled field reached a bacterial level of2.0 x 107 CFUIIOOml. Similarly, Stoddard et al. (1998) investigated fecal bacteria transport in tilled and no-till soils, and found no significant difference in the average concentrations at 90cm deep in either field. In both the tilled and notilled fields, average concentrations reached 3 x 10 FCII OOml. Lastly, Wall et al. (1998) also showed that transport of greater than acceptable levels of E. coli reached depths of 0.87, 0.80, and 0.67cm under the conditions deemed acceptable in Section 6.11. They applied liquid swine manure at a rate of 66.1 m3/ha and tilled prior to injection (modified injection); this would allow application on land if depth of soil over bedrock was 60cm to 1.5m. Transport of E. coli in this study exceeded acceptable levels in three soil types and all three depths investigated, therefore showing that under nonnal agricultural practices specified in Section 6.11, pathogen transport is possible. The other studies in Appendices 4.5 and 4.6 cannot be used to specifically analyze this regulation because one or more of the required conditions are not met in the study; for example, some used an E. coli suspension rather than livestock waste; in others, application

rates were too high or tillage did not occur on the study site. For example, Tamasi (1981) showed transport of E. coli and Salmonella to a depth of 160 centimetres in tilled soil at a rate of 56.67m 3lha but levels of the pathogens at that depth were not given 33 · This application rate would be allowed if depth of soil over bedrock is 60-150cm, therefore the E. coli and
Salmonella in this study would have reached water within bedrock, but at what level is

uncertain. The evidence of the studies that were conducted within the specifications of Section 6.11 show that this regulation based on tillage and rates of application would likely be ineffective at controlling the transport of pathogens to bedrock under normal agricultural conditions. Section 6.12 of the Nutrient Management Act, Minimum Depth to Groundwater: Section 6.12 states that agricultural operators are not permitted to apply prescribed materials to land unless there are at least 90 centimeters of soil over a permanent water table, and that the first 30 centimeters at the surface of the ground must be unsaturated. This regulation relies on the filtration and adsorption properties of soils to retain waste within the top 90 centimeters of soil. Unsaturated soils allow microorganisms to get closer to soil particles because water does not flow through macropores, it flows only through micropores, and this allows easier adsorption to soils (Bitton and Gerba, 1984). Therefore, the regulation specifies application during unsaturated conditions. McCoy and Hagedorn (1979) also conducted a study of subsurface transport under saturated conditions and stressed the need for a large zone of unsaturated soil to prevent the mobilization of pathogen populations in the soil matrix. Unfortunately, of the studies that have investigated vertical transport of pathogens, most simulate average rainfalls to promote the transport of pathogens through the soil matrix. The study conducted by Wall et al. (1998) is the only one that has investigated the transport of
E. coli prior to rainfall and immediately following application; this lack of additional evidence

under similar conditions suggests that there is a gap in the understanding of this issue. Wall et al. (1998) investigated the transport of E. coli in three soil types, but for the purposes of this discussion, the experiment on the silt loam soil will be disregarded because the tile drains were flowing at the time of waste application. They found that despite the dry conditions, transport

in the sandy loam and silty clay soils was significant and bacterial concentrations in the tile waters exceeded acceptable primary water contact levels. Concentrations in the sandy loam soils, at a depth of80cm, ranged from 5.0 x 103 to 6.5 x 104/100ml, and concentrations in the silty clay loam at a depth of67cm ranged from 2.5 x 104 to 1.22 x 105/100mI. Although these depths do not reach 90 centimeters as specified in Section 6.12, and since the depths measured in the study were controlled by the tile drains, the numbers of organisms per 100ml at these depths suggest that if pathogens were able to continue to move vertically through the soil matrix to 90cm, rates would have remained above the MAC.
It is important to note that other studies show transport to 90cm is possible (Patterson et

aI. 1974; McCoy and Hagedorn, 1979; Tamasi, 1981; Stoddard et aI. 1998; and Rothmaier et aI. 1998) under natural conditions and conditions of simulated rainfall (see Appendices 4.5 and 4.6). In both Stoddard et aI. (1998) and Rothmaier et aI. (1998), experiments were conducted in-field under natural conditions and in both cases waste was applied during dry conditions but leachate was not monitored until rainfall occurred. Unfortunately, there were no measurements taken immediately following application but these studies indicate that the E. coli and fecal coli forms were able to survive in the unsaturated soil matrices until rainfall occurred which mobilized retained organisms. The ability of pathogenic organisms to survive in soil for extended periods of time increases their probability of transport because they can remain viable until rainfall events occur. Based on a single study (Wall et al. 1998) in unsaturated conditions, it is unlikely that the specifications in Section 6.12 regarding water transport to groundwater sources would adequately prevent pathogens from reaching the water table. The evidence from other studies also shows that pathogenic organisms are persistent in agricultural soils and this persistence gives them the ability to remain viable until rainfall and then be transported. Therefore the regulations' ability to retain pathogenic organisms within the soil matrix is severely limited by the ability of bacteria to remain viable for extended lengths oftime.

5.3 Horizontal Transport and Prevention of Runoff
The Nutrient Management Act (2002) includes three sections to prevent horizontal transport of wastes in the subsurface environment and primarily through runoff. These include Section 6.6 Setbacks from Wells, Section 6.9 Application Setbacks with Vegetated Buffer Zones, and Section 6.10 Application Setbacks when no Vegetated Buffer Zone exists.

101

Section 6.6 states that agricultural source materials must not be applied to land closer than:

a) 15m/rom a well with a water-tight casing reaching 6/t. underground; b) 30m/i-om a well with no water-tight casing;
c) 100m/i-om a well that supplies water to a municipal water works

These regulations assume that the wells are managed accordingly and are known about, properly maintained, commissioned, constructed and sited. Further, Section 6.9 requires a minimum separation distance to surface waters of 13m from the top of the bank when a vegetated butfer zone exists or, application is allowed within 13m if the waste is injected, incorporated within 24 hours, or applied to a land covered with a living crop. Lastly, if a vegetated buffer zone has not yet been constructed, Section 6.10 states that the minimum separation distance to surface waters from application be 20 meters for non-agricultural and liquid wastes, and 10 meters for solid agricultural waste. In the review of existing information, few studies measured horizontal pathogen transport either through runoff or in the subsurface. Most focused on the quality of runoff and not distance transported. No studies tested the range of minimum separation distances (MSD) that have been regulated in various jurisdictions across Canada, the United States and other countries to determine which MSDs are effective and which are not. Most investigations of runoff water quality focus on the nutrient quality of the water since nutrients have been a topic of interest in the last decade with the increasing rate of eutrophication in various watersheds across the province and country. Although the specifications in Section 6.10 regulate the use ofliquid agricultural waste more strictly than solid wastes, studies have not been conducted that investigate the difference in transport between the two types of waste, all other factors remaining the same. Again, the predominant factor in the transport of microorganisms through runoff has been shown to be rainfall, and applications cannot be regulated with certainty since weather systems can change so quickly and forecasting is less than perfect. The lack of studies investigating this issue suggests a gap in the knowledge regarding the horizontal transport of pathogens on agricultural land. It must also be noted that similar to the vertical transport studies, investigations of the transport potential of pathogenic organisms have

102

been conducted under simulated rainfall or natural rainfall conditions, therefore leaving a gap in the knowledge of transport under dry conditions. Two studies have reported the horizontal distance traveled by Escherichia coli and its concentration levels in runoff water; McCoy and Hagedorn (1979 and Abu-Ashour and Lee (2000) (see Appendix 4.7). Although the evidence is sparse, based on their conclusions, E. coli transport in runoff or the subsurface has been shown to be substantial in agricultural soils and able to travel farther than distances established in the Nutrient Management Act in Sections 6.6,6.9, and 6.10. The study by McCoy and Hagedorn (1979) that involved injecting an E. coli tracer into silty clay loam in a field with a slope of 14% resulted in concentrations of E. coli greater than 105/100ml found at a 20.5m distance from the injection site. Under the Nutrient Management Act, application on clay soils, considered 'slow' based on the runoff potential of soil hydrologic groups, is prohibited on a 14% slope within 150 meters of a watercourse. However, this study did not apply liquid prescribed materials but injected a biotracer at a depth of 30cm. Although the degree of slope is too large for liquid prescribed materials, solid materials can be applied on a slope of this degree and therefore could travel this distance. If this was the case, the distance traveled would show that the MSDs that have been specified in the NMA may be inadequate at minimizing bacterial transport to nearby surface waters or wells. Since the study was conducted using a biotracer, it can't be said with certainty whether the regulations would control pathogen transport. However, because the E. coli were injected rather than surfaceapplied, it strengthens the argument that pathogens have the ability to be transported. Abu-Ashour and Lee (2000) conducted an experiment also

biotracer. E. coli transport was investigated on two fields with slopes of 2% and 6%, both of clay loam. Rainfall occurred two days after application and transport was measured; on the 2% sloped field concentrations of 1500 CFU/IOOml were found at 20 meters from the application site and on the greater slope concentrations of 1600 CFU/l OOml were found 35 meters from the site of application. Although application was conducted on a dry field, the E. coli were not measured until rainfall occurred, therefore it is uncertain how much of the E. coli was transported prior to the rainfall, but it does show that the E. coli survived in the dry soil matrix until rainfall occurred. Although this study was conducted with a biotracer rather than livestock waste, the distances traveled extend past the minimum separation distances set for either slurry

or solid waste for application adjacent to surface water sources. Based on these distances, E.
coli would have also reached wells with water-tight casings or, in the case of the 6% sloped

field, would have reached wells without watertight casings 30 meters away at levels exceeding the MAC by 16 times. Despite the lack of studies on horizontal transport, the results show that a setback distance in the range of 13 meters to 30 meters may not be adequate to prevent contamination of surface waters and well waters under certain environmental conditions. The results of McCoy and Hagedorn (1979) showed a significant distance traveled, despite the injection of E. coli. This evidence, coupled with the fact that vegetated buffer zones are inadequate at controlling pathogens, strengthens the argument that the MSD ofless than 13 meters 34 may be too narrow to retain pathogenic organisms and prevent surface water or well contamination.

5.4 Pre-grazing and Pre-harvesting Periods
Under sections 6.14 and 6.15 of the Nutrient Management Act (2002), pre-harvesting and pre-grazing periods are required when land is applied with non-agricultural source material; this is an appropriate regulation based on the survival of pathogenic organisms that can be contained in these wastes. However, there is a gap in the NMA (2002) in that there are no required waiting periods after the application of agricultural livestock wastes before grazing and harvesting. This omission suggests that there is no microbiological risk when applying livestock wastes to agricultural lands. The evidence that pathogens are numerable, can persist in soil and pasture environments (see Appendix 4.3), and have the ability to grow in optimal environments, speaks to the need for pre-harvesting and pre-grazing periods after the application oflivestock wastes. Studies conducted by Fenlon et al. (2000) and Ogden et al. (2001) support this argument and both suggest that recommended pre-harvesting and pregrazing periods are necessary to enhance die-off and the ability to control the spread of pathogens. Pre-grazing periods are essential to minimize the risk of the re-infection of herds from consuming pathogens that have remained viable in grazing fields. Herd health is an important factor in controlling the spread of pathogenic organisms throughout agricultural environments. Minimizing infection and re-infection of herds will therefore minimize the amount of pathogens being applied to land. However, herd health and hygiene have little to do
34

with the control of nutrients and therefore this may be a gap in water protection when trying to control pathogens under nutrient management policies.

5.5 Gaps When Using Nutrient Management to Control Pathogens
Pathogen control cannot be addressed adequately by nutrient management policies because, along with the uncertainty of pathogen fate and transport under nutrient management regulations, nutrient management policies do not address critical pathogen issues. Using nutrient management policies to control pathogens leaves a number of gaps in important issues that can help to reduce the risk ofwaterbome-disease outbreaks from land application of livestock wastes. Some of the issues that are overlooked include the use of treatment to reduce microorganism concentrations in stored waste or management practices that reduce microorganism levels in waste, animal health and hygiene, and emerging issues in pathogen control such as the spread ofbioaerosols and biosecurity issues. Most of these issues deal with pathogen loads; by minimizing pathogen loads prior to land application, the risk of water pollution can be also be minimized.
Animal Health and Hygiene

Effective pathogen management will begin before manure is even produced. A primary pathway for pathogens to infect farm animals is through their feed source; therefore feed must be kept pathogen-free. Adequate transport and storage of feed will make it less likely for rodents to enter and contaminate it. Rodents have been demonstrated to have a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Salmonella (Rosen, 2000); therefore ensuring they don't have access to the feed will reduce the risk of passing pathogenic diseases onto the healthy animals. Another management practice in ensuring a healthy herd is to quarantine new and incoming livestock until a veterinarian is able to examine them. A fecal examination may also be required to determine the health status of the animal. Allowing only healthy animals to enter a herd so that illness and disease do not spread throughout the facility is a proactive approach that raises the standards of operations but does not insure that infection will not occur within
the herd. Quarantine has also been suggested due to the stress that animals endure during

transport. Stress provokes healthy carriers of pathogens to become active carriers and begin shedding organisms at high rates (Clinton et al. 1979). The overall health of the herd is important in pathogen control since infected animals are not recognizable. A healthy herd will more likely be able to reduce the risk of an outbreak

of pathogenic disease. The nutrient management policies reviewed do not discuss the health of the farm animals, whereas in pathogen management, it is one of the first source protection steps. Pathogen prevalence has been shown to be directly related to the age of the infected species. Age has an effect on the amount of shedding that occurs. In cattle, clinical disease and the shedding of environmentally resistant Cryptosporidium oocysts are usually limited to calves under a few months of age (Atwill, 1995; Pell, 1997; Rosen, 2000). Pathogenic organisms attack immunocompromised or young cattle as they do in humans. Therefore, special care should be taken when handling manure around young animals. As well, if possible, young animals should be restricted from grazing on fields where manure had been applied to reduce the risk of pathogen uptake and infection. Again, the focus on certain species, especially the young, is unique to best pathogen management practices and is not addressed in nutrient management guidelines or regulations. Increased care of young animals is another source protection approach that can reduce the risk of pathogen contamination when handling, storing, or applying manure.
Treatment Effects on Survival of Pathogens in Manure and Slurry

To reduce the risk of pathogen contamination, pathogens must be killed or rendered non-infective. The optimal time to reduce pathogen loads in wastes would be during storage, through desiccation and intense heat. A number of treatment methods have been shown to be effective at reducing the numbers of viable pathogenic organisms in slurry and manure better than conventional methods of storage. Appendix 5.1 shows the details of a number of studies, including survival times of pathogenic organisms when stored in various systems. Composting and drying have been shown to be effective at decreasing the viability of microorganisms in animal wastes. For example, Vuorinen and Saharinen (1997) studied the effect of manure and straw co-compo sting in a drum compo sting system. Dairy cattle and swine manure was mixed with straw (1:2 ratio of manure and straw) and was actively composted for 5-7 days within the drum, a long tube-like composter. The drum controls composting by continuously rotating and aerating the waste. Temperatures in the drum reached 52-62°C. After seven days waste was recovered from the drum and piled, and then turned once a month for 3 months. The researchers indicated that fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci

disappeared within the first 7 days in the drum. It was concluded that the thermophilic active composting process in the drum was capable of destroying the populations of bacteria. Composting has also been shown to reduce E. coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella levels in animal waste. Lung et al (2001) showed that composting of cow manure is less effective at lower temperatures compared to higher temperatures. In this study, 107 CFU/g of S. enteriditis and E. coli 0157 :H7 were inoculated into cow manure to determine the effect of composting at various temperatures on their viability. It was found that, for both types of bacteria, compo sting at 25"C had no effect on their levels after 96 hours, whereas composting at 45"C reduced E. coli to undetectable levels after 72 hours and Salmonella to undetectable levels after 48 hours. Both of these studies are consistent with Jones (1980) who found that when temperatures rose as high as 70"C, bacteria, including Salmonella were killed with 5 to 37 days. Aeration of manure has also proven to reduce numbers of pathogenic organisms more effectively than normal storage conditions. In a study conducted by Munch et al. (1987), selected pathogenic bacteria were seeded in batches of aerated and non-aerated slurry stored in parallel at high (18-20"C) and low (6-9"C) temperatures. Pathogenic bacteria, E. coli and fecal streptococci of the slurry flora were all progressively reduced in number during storage in the slurries, and at both temperature levels the inactivation was faster in aerated than in corresponding non-aerated slurry batches. Kudva et al. (1998) also analyzed the survival of E.
coli 0157:H7 in ovine and bovine manure and slurry and the effects of aeration on its survival.
It was found that organisms in waste that was aerated did not survive near as long as those in

waste that was not aerated. In the non-aerated manure, E. coli 0157:H7 survived for up to 7 months whereas in the aerated wastes, E. coli persisted for only 47 days and 4 months in ovine and bovine manure respectively. They concluded that aeration was effective at decreasing the viability of the microorganisms because of the drying effect of the aeration process. Similarly, Heinonen-Tanski et al (1998) investigated the effects of aeration on Salmonella viability in animal slurry. Slurries were stored in glass bottles at controlled temperatures and were aerated with a small pump and mixed. After the pumping and mixing process, no addition of fresh slurry was allowed. This step simulated. batch storage management. Aeration took place at a variety of temperatures and proved that temperatures as low as 7.5°C can reduce

microorganism levels in waste. This work showed that aeration reduced Salmonella levels to below 99% within 2 to 5 weeks in both cattle and pig slurries. These studies show that improperly incubated or untreated slurry and manure can provide a vehicle for pathogen contamination once applied on land and that treated manure can reduce the likelihood of microbial contamination of water sources, crops or the re-infection of livestock herds. The use of technology and certain storage systems to kill pathogen loads in manure should be a focus of policies created to control pathogenic contamination of water sources. It is not necessary in nutrient management to take into account the persistence of nitrogen and phosphorous whereas pathogen management must focus on the survival and growth of . . mIcroorgamsms. According to the Farm Environmental Management Survey that Statistics Canada compiled in 2002, 30% of farm operations in Canada and 26% of farm operations in Ontario currently compost manure. However, only 3% of all farms across Canada aerate their stored wastes and more than 39% in Canada, and 52% in Ontario do not treat their wastes at all(Statistics Canada, 2002). These statistics show that there is a need to address this issue since much of the waste being applied to land has been untreated.

Batch Storage methods
As Heinonen-Tanski et al (1998) suggest, batch storage has been shown to effectively reduce microorganism loads in stored wastes. Batch storage involves storing manures and slurries for a period of time without additions of fresh manure allowing greater die-out and desiccation of pathogenic organisms to occur. Kearney et al. (1993) studied the survival of manure under treatment and in batch storage. The researchers studied the survival of a number of pathogenic organisms in beef cattle slurry in normal storage, batch anaerobic digestion and semi-continuous digestion. It was shown that the time it took to reach T90 values for batch anaerobic digestion were less than semi-continuous digestion for both E. coli and Salmonella. Therefore, batch storage of animal wastes is more effective at reducing viable numbers of pathogens than semi-continuous anaerobic storage. Batch storage has also been shown to work effectively without the additional effects of treatment. Patni et al. (1984) concur and suggest that the potential for pollution of waters after land application is lower when manures have been stored to reduce microorganisms compared

with fresh slurry. Patni et al. (1984) showed that microorganisms had lower T<)o values when wastes were stored. Both Fenlon et al. (2000) and Ogden et al. (200 I) agree that it is advantageous to store waste for a minimum period where no other additions are allowed, in order to maximize the effect of die-off prior to application. Both Munch et al. (1987) and Strauch (1991) suggest that the decimal reduction times (T<)0) calculated in the existing studies can be used practically to establish advisable batch storage holding times for slurries and solid wastes to reduce the risk of infection once wastes are spread onto the land. The method of storage has been shown to be an important factor that can reduce pathogen loads and therefore risk of contamination. Storage methods should be addressed in a pathogen management program, however, they are currently not considered under nutrient management policies. Across Canada, 20% of farm operations have no storage facilities for wastes (Statistics Canada, 2002); based on the evidence, application of this amount of fresh waste onto agricultural land increases the risk of waterborne disease outbreaks. Emerging Issues Pathogens are disease causing organisms that live by the motto 'only the strong survive', therefore pathogenic organisms such as E. coli 0157:H7 and C. parvum have the ability to adapt and increase their chances of survival in various environments. This ability to adapt has ensured that scientists and researchers must continually monitor changes in levels of virulence, resistance to drinking water treatments and also changes in microorganisms that can cause infection in humans. For example, it was only twenty years ago that E. coli 0157:H7 was discovered as a human pathogen. This evolution of pathogenic organisms speaks to the need for specific pathogen control in agricultural operations, since emerging pathogens can render other barriers unprotected, such as water treatment plants without a method for treatment until the microorganism is detected and studied. Other security issues in pathogen control include the implementation ofbiosecurity practices and the spread of pathogens through bioaersols. Biosecurity Practices: Since the rate of pathogen incidence in livestock herds can be high, and once a herd is infected the disease can spread quickly due to the close-knit living quarters in agricultural operations, biosecurity needs to be implemented to control this spread in a manner similar to any other disease. Biosecurity is a set of practices that will limit the spread of disease-causing

organisms throughout the agricultural operation. Biosecurity practices include restricting human traffic in agricultural operations, disinfecting and cleaning vehicles that may have come from other operations including those of veterinarians and inspectors. Vector minimization can also reduce the spread of disease including rodent and wild bird controls, since these species have been shown to be hosts of pathogenic microorganisms. The reduction of the spread of pathogen infection will reduce pathogen loads and lead to a decreased risk of water contamination. Bioaerosols: Bioaerosols have also become a subject of interest and are in fact another pathway for pathogen contamination. Bioaersols are airborne particles consisting of or originating from microorganisms or fragments of microorganisms (Forcier, 2002). Bioaerosols become airborne through the release of dust and water droplets (Forcier, 2002) which can occur during the application of wastes to land when wastes are sprayed at high pressures. Bioaerosols are minute particles that can travel distances in the air and be inhaled by humans or travel to water sources and contaminate water supplies. The issue of pathogenic contamination through bioaersol travel is relatively new; Pillai and Ricke (2002) discuss the issue ofbioaerosol creation resulting from animal wastes and note that bioaerosol transport has been shown to occur (Sorber et al. 1984). However, more research is needed to estimate human health risks associated with bioaerosolized pathogens, including the levels of pathogens that could be transported and the dose-response from bioaerosols. In order to prevent pathogen contamination, the issue ofbioaerosols as a pathway should be addressed, using nutrient management policies to control pathogens inadequately addresses the issue and reinstates the argument that pathogen are weakly controlled under nutrient management policies.

5.6 Conclusions
Management policies that are designed primarily for sediment and nutrient control may not provide sufficient pathogen control for public health protection. The analysis of the Nutrient Management Act regulations with respect to pathogen fate and transport showed that there is an absence of existing scientific evidence to state with certainty whether the land application regulations of the Nutrient Management Act would adequately control the risk of pathogenic contamination of water sources. The majority of the studies showed that despite tillage and application rates, survival and transport of pathogenic organisms does occur, and

occurs differently than for sediments and nutrients. The analysis also showed that there are gaps in pathogenic control when nutrient management policies are applied. For example, the need to promote the health and hygiene of livestock herds is important in pathogen control but irrelevant with respect to nutrient management. There are a number of risk factors that affect pathogen fate and transport such as high shedding rates of infected animals, their persistence in agricultural environments, their ability to grow in optimal conditions and ability to be transported under a number of management practices, especially in uncontrollable events such as rainfall. These risk factors suggest that pathogen transport and fate, once applied to agricultural land, will always be somewhat uncertain, even if additional research is conducted in this area. These uncertainties are detrimental to public health considering pathogens can cause acute health effects in humans; therefore, in order to minimize this uncertainty and protect public health, pathogens must be addressed prior to land application and cannot be controlled simply as untargeted contaminants under nutrient management policies and regulations.

Chapter Six: Conclusions and Recommendations
6.1 Conclusions
Based on the review of existing scientific studies, nutrient management policies can not be applied to adequately control the risk of pathogen contamination in agricultural environments.
It must be noted that the focus of this work, the Ontario Nutrient Management Act, 2002, is

only one component in the mUltiple barrier approach to protect drinking water, the approach that has been highly recommended by Justice O'Connor in the Walkerton Inquiry reports. The multiple barrier approach involves a set of protection measures put in place to guard against contamination of drinking water. The barriers in this approach include source water protection, water treatment, properly maintained and operated water treatment facilities, and comprehensive training of water treatment operators. This work shows the limited effectiveness of one policy designed to protect source waters, the first layer of the multiple barrier approach, and has shown that of the four elements in the approach, it is the element most uncertain in its pathogen abatement effects. Historically, source protection has not been sufficiently utilized in Canadian policies compared to the other barriers in the multiple-barrier approach (Johns, 2000; Federal-Provincial-Territorial, 2002), and will continue to be insufficiently utilized if pathogen management is not more effectively addressed. Pathogen control is not effectively addressed in nutrient management policies based on three important factors: 1. Pathogens have the ability to persist in many agricultural environments. Their prolonged survival allows them to remain viable in the soil matrix until transport occurs, therefore despite tillage and the disruption of macropores or the rate of application, pathogens have survived until transport can take place; 2. Pathogens are transported differently than sediments and nutrients, therefore regulations put in place to control sediments and nutrients can be unsuitable for pathogen control, as was seen in many of the studies that reviewed the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips; and 3. Nutrient management policies do not address critical pathogen issues such as pathogen load reduction, prevention of the spread of disease and emerging issues such as biosecurity.

The Ontario Nutrient Management Act (2002) is included as part of Ontario's Strategy for Safe Drinking Water. It was legislated primarily to manage nutrients, although the public has assumed that it is also a means of pathogen abatement due to the attention that the Act received after the Walkerton incident, and because this waterborne disease outbreak was in fact caused by a pathogenic bacterium; Escherichia coli OI57:H7. The fact that this Act will not effectively perform as a pathogen management measure will be upsetting to those that are most concerned about contamination of drinking water and potential waterborne disease and believe the NMA was developed to minimize the risk of another "Walkerton". In order to protect source water efficiently, the gap in pathogen management policy must be closed. Pathogen management should be of the utmost importance considering many rural residents in Ontario obtain their drinking water supplies from unfiltered well water sources in highly agricultural areas. A focus on pathogen management will promote practices that are not addressed under nutrient management policies and ensure more effective source protection.

6.2 Recommendations
1. If the goal is to protect pubic health through source protection measures, acutely toxic microbial contamination must be addressed. This will require another effort at creating a set of policies that will enhance the existing level of control to better protect water sources. Pathogen management policies must include agricultural operator education, herd health management and pathogen-load reduction methods during storage in order that the uncertainties in fate and transport of pathogens after land-application of wastes are minimized. The key to a successful pathogen management policy is to focus on the survival of microorganisms in the waste prior to land application. 2. Since testing for pathogenic organisms is very expensive and requires training, and since herd infections are episodic in nature and could be missed if testing were not conducted regularly, policy makers and agricultural operators must assume that all livestock wastes contain pathogenic materials at normal shedding concentrations.
Following the precautionary principle and assuming risk will ensure that wastes are

handled appropriately and with caution at all times and will increase control of microbial contamination. 3. The probability that pathogens will survive in a prescribed waste and be transported to a human water source depends on a number of variables as reported in this study. A

risk assessment approach can be applied to determine the greatest agricultural risk sources, the probability of pathogen survival and the possibility of transport to water sources. However, as this research has shown, there are gaps in the knowledge needed to establish reliable probabilities. 4. This study should be repeated with a focus on viral fate and transport in agricultural operations, including enteroviruses, rotaviruses, and Norwalk-like viruses, to assess the current control of viral contamination since these organisms are also prevalent in agricultural wastes and are also currently remain as untargeted contaminants. 5. The existing knowledge of managing the microbial risk oflivestock waste is lacking and therefore further research should be conducted so that pathogen management policies can be created based on sound scientific knowledge.

Agricultural Waste Control Regulation Drinking Water Protection Act

Reg 131/92. Part of the Waste Management Act and the Health Act. Act

April 1992

I,

Farmers are exempt from the WMA provided that they comply with the Code of Agricultural Practice for waste management. The drinking water action plan is based on eight key principles for safe drinking water, which focus on preventing contamination, and identifying potential risks and appropriate water quality improvements. This Act provides the institutional framework for resolving conflicts between agricultural producers and the urban/rural non-farmers. Under the Act, farmers using generally accepted practices and not contravening the land use bylaws of the municipality in which the operation is located, are not liable in a nuisance lawsuit and cannot be prevented from carrying on their operation because it causes or creates a nuisance. The Province's review of its water management policy and legislation began in 1991 with the view of updating its water management policy and legislation to ensure that Alberta's water is managed and conserved for today and for the future. The JVater Resources Act was over 60 years old and was primarily a tool for allocating water. The new Act focuses on managing and protecting Alberta's water and on streamlining administrative processes. This Act requires waste storage and management plans for ILOs. There are 3 definitions for ILOs including any operation with 20 animal units or more that is within a certain distance of either an open body of water or domestic water well. This document describes normally accepted practices for establishing and managing livestock operations. SAFRR has tried to balance the competing interests of agricultural producers and their neighbours, as well as reconciling the regional and cultural differences that exist within the province.

Livestock Manure and Mortalities Management Regulation Proposed Nutrient Management Strategy for Manitoba's Surface Water Regulation Respecting Agricultural Operations Regulation 99-32 under the Livestock Operations Act Wellfield Protected Area Designated Order under the Clean Water Act Manure Management Guidelines

Regulation 42/98

March 30, 1998

Proposed by Manitoba Conservation

May 2002

7,

This regulation under the Environment Act was adopted in 1998 after a review of the Livestock Waste Regulation that was then in effect. The purpose of this regulation is to prescribe requirements for the use, management, and storage of livestock manure and mortalities in agricultural operations so that livestock manure and mortalities are handled in an environmentally friendly manner. Manitoba Conservation has responded to the nutrient enrichment issue by identifying the need for the development of a long-term Nutrient Management Strategy for the province and beginning to work towards this strategy.

The Regulation respecting agricultural operations in effect as of June 15, 2002, addresses livestock facilities and manure management. It replaces the Regulation respecting the reduction of pollution from agricultural sources. The information that I have is incomplete blc I have what is only written in English. May I, The Livestock Operations Act and the regulations under the Act, establish a 1999 framework for a licensing system that is being put in place to ensure that the livestock industry in the province develops in an environmentally responsible manner. October I, The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that portions of the ground water 2000 recharge areas that are used as sources of water for a public ground water supply, are designated as protected areas. This is an innovative source protection regulation. February The Manure Management Guidelines for NB have been developed by the Land 1,1997 Development Branch, NB Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Aquaculture in consultation with other government agencies and farm organizations. The users of these guidelines are cautioned that they are based on minimal recommended practices, or better. 1991 The purpose of the guidelines is to create an awareness of animal manure as a valuable fertilizer source and soil amendment, while providing instruction in environmental protection. The objectives of these guidelines are to: 1) Provide info and guidance to farmers, on how to manage hog farms in an environmentally acceptable manner. 2) Provide municipalities with info on acceptable management practices and siting guidelines for hog farms, which may be incorporated into municipal bylaws, and 3) Provide stakeholders, including hog farmers, planner, environnlental groups, and financial institutions, with guidelines to assess the siting and mamlgement of hog farms.

In this act all dairies in the state are required to register with the Department of Ecology and prepare and implement a dairy nutrient management plan. The required NMPs have to use the practice standards of the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the USDA. This document was designed to help the agricultural community meet existing regulations. It provides operators with information on farm management practices that protect both surface and ground water. These guidelines will help managers develop, implement, and monitor a NMP. Iowa law requires that all manure from animal feeding operations must be land applied in a manner that will not cause surface or groundwater pollution. Chapter 65 contains rules that govern land application of manure.

By establishing and enforcing standards and properly managing animal waste, we can protect our valuable water resources. Preventing contamination is the key to protecting water quali!y for all Missouri citizens. Runoff Management defines agricultural performance standards and prohibitions, nonagricultural performance standards, transportation facility perfornlance standards and a process for the development and dissemination of non-agricultural technical standards. Animal Feeding Operations: adds the NR 151 performance standards and prohibitions to the Manure Management Program.
Proper manure management and handling is complicated. This publication describes how to maximize manure's benefits to plants and soils and to minimize the possibility of surface or groundwater pollution from manure applications. The guidelines described provide the basis for developing an economically and environmentally-sound manuremanagement plan. This chapter governs the storage, transportation, disposal and utilization of animal manure and process wastewaters and the application for and issuance of permits for construction and operation of animal manure management and disposal or utilization systems for the protection of the environment.

LB 1209: The Livestock Waste Management Act Title 130: Rules and Regulations Pertaining to Livestock Waste Control

Nebraska Department of Quality Nebraska Department of Quality

April 1998

The goal of the Livestock Waste Control Program is to protect the state's groundwater and surface water for pollution resulting from improper livestock waste disposal. Calving operations holding cattle less than ninety days per year are exempt from Title 130 requirements. The Livestock Program administers and enforces Title 130. The Title 130 Regulations are based on the Livestock Waste Management Act and all other livestockrelated legislation that has been passed by our state legislature since about 1972. Whenever new legislation passes (not too often, actually), Title 130 is updated to reflect the changes.

1972, and updated anytime new Iivestocklegislation is passed.

Once the boundaries have been set, part of the process of completing a plan will be to identify all of the inputs into the river system within a basin or watershed, followed by the development and implementation of strategies aimed at reducing these inputs, where required. These strategies may include spreading, storage, and tillage requirements of any activity that puts nutrients into the soils and watercourses of the area. 36 Each Zone is restricted in the allowable amount of storage of various manures and fertilizers. (C>B> A). 37 Manure Storage plans must include specific details that follow normally accepted agricultural practices that are laid out in the Livestock Operations Guidelines for Saskatchewan. 38 Fann operators should obtain a manure handling system design from the NS Department of Agriculture and Marketing Extension Services agricultural engineers. The system plan will incorporate farm resource considerations including economics, manpower, and equipment, existing structures, animal p.0pulations, site characteristics and storage capacity. <) See Appendix 3.8 40 See Appendix 3.9 41 See Appendix 3.10 42 This MSD does not apply if the owner or operator demonstrates to the Board, before the facility or area is constructed that, a) the natural drainage from the facility or area is away from the common body of water, or b) a berm or other secondary protection for the common body of water constructed by the owner or operator protects the common body of water from contamination.

Additional separation is based on a PEl County Soil Survey and the concerns regarding mobility in certain soils. See Appendix 3.11 45 There are special construction requirements for coarse sands, gravel, and fractured rock. 46 Liquid and semi-solid manure storages must be designed and constructed according to the structural and safety requirements of the Canadian Farm Building Code. 47 The storage capacity of 7 months is for the accumulation of liquid manure. Solid manure storage should allow for a minimum of 60 days accumulation of manure in combination with field storage. If field storage is not an option, then a 210 day storage at the bam is recommended.

56 Nutrient Management Plans must be developed or approved by a certified Nutrient Management Planner. The NMPs are very site specific and spreading MSDs are determined based on topography, crop, location of water sources etc ... The only minimum separation distance required on every operation is that storage facilities must be at least 30.48m from any domestic wells. 57 See Appendix 3.12: Required Separation Distances for Manure Storage Structures in Iowa. 58 The department shall not issue a permit for an existing livestock waste control facility which is located within 30.48m of a well if the water well is under separate ownership and water from the well is used primarily for human consumption.

Please see Appendix 3.13: Waste Treatment Technology in the PEPFAA. Field storage is only allowed after the manure has been composted for at least 3 months and has a dry matter content of at least 30%. It also must be sited away from areas that become flooded or in areas above groundwater. 7J Construction requirements of a field pile include a mud or peat layer 15 cm thick that must be spread at the bottom of the heap in order to catch nutrient runoff. The field pile must covered by a tarpaulin, and piling manure in the same place every year must be avoided.

Appendix 3.13: Waste Treatment Technology in Scotland's Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural Activity
Separation of solids and liquids through the use of screen or belt presses or centrifuges. Advantages to separation include allowing solids to compost once separated and then spreading without odour. Aeration of the slurry portion of the waste can then take place. AD involves storage in an insulated tank where the waste is mixed regularly and heated to 35 or 55°C. Recommended Anaerobic Digestion (AD) treatment periods are: 12-15 days for pig slurry, 20 days for cattle and poultry slurries. Slurry can be aerated in tanks, or lagoons using compressed air or mechanical aerators. Aerobic treatments are short: 3-10 days Aerobic Treatment to remove odours, reduce BOD, and manipulate nitrogen. Slurry Acidification is conducted to prevent ammonia emissions and therefore increase the amount of ammonia for plant Slurry Acidification growth. Slurry is acidified using nitrate, sulphuric or phosphoric acids. Not used too commonlybecause the benefits < cost. Nitrification inhibitors are added to slurry to reduce nitrogen leaching when applied to land. These inhibitors keep the nitrogen Nitrification Inhibitors in the form of ammonia instead of the more easily leachable nitrate. It is more economical to inject or immediately incorporate slurry into the soil when using this method, it makes the method more economical than when manure is surface applied especially since this method is weather sensitive. Slurry Additives and These additives are short term solutions to odour problems. Additives include oxidizing agents, masking agents and biological digestive agents. Deodorants Composting is a natural aerobic process that stabilizes organic matter such as solid manure. The high temperatures that occur Composting reduce the harmful organisms and there is no odour. The end result is a marketable product. Note: These treatments are all recommended and the use of one treatment will depend on individual needs and farm operations.

Each Zone is restricted in the allowable amount of applied nutrients and fertilizers. (C>8>A). Spreading Agreements: Operators who do not have sufficient land base to effectively utilize the manure for growing crops should enter into written agreements with other land owners for the land application of manure for the purpose of growing crops. These should have a minimum duration of two years. 78 Manure Spreading plans must include specific details that follow normally accepted agricultural practices that are laid out in the Livestock Operations Guidelines for Saskatchewan. 79 No specific MSDs are given. Instead unfavorable conditions are listed including: on frozen land, in diverting winds, on areas having standing water, on saturated soils and in rates that exceed crop requirements. 80 See Appendix 3.18: Saskatchewan Manure Spreading Minimum Separation Distances. 81 See Appendix 3.20: Minimum Recommended Separation Distances for Manure Application in the Guidelines for the Management and Use of Animal Manure in Nova Scotia. 82 See Appendix 3.21: Recommended Setback Distances for Spreading Manure in PEL 83 See Appendix 3.17: Minimum Setback Distances in the Alberta Agricultural Operation Practices Act. 84 Manure should not be spread on sloping land to a watercourse without immediate incorporation or the provision of an appropriate buffer strip to prevent contamination of the watercourse. Liquid manure being spread on land within 300 meters of any watercourse must be spread at rates to ensure that all liquid is absorbed by the soil and no runoff occurs. Manure should not be applied to land within 30 meters of the bank of any watercourse unless incorporated into the soil within one day. Manure should not be applied to land within 5 meters of the bank of a watercourse under any circumstances.

85 When applied to fields located within 200m of a residence during the months of July and August, manure should be incorporated into the soil within 24 hours of application. 86 Manure spread on agricultural fields between November 10 and April 15 must adhere to specific setback distances, see Appendix 3.19. Small-scale livestock producers are exempt from the ban on winter spreading but must comply with mandatory setback distances. 7 Soil testing must be conducted every three years if the operator spreads more than 300 tonnes of manure annually. 88 The application rate of manure should not exceed the amount necessary to meet the crop nitrogen requirements. These guidelines present two methods of calculating application rates: 1) an estimated land base area using typical nutrient production rates, and 2) a detailed method using site specific manure and soil test results.

Please see Appendix 3.22 for Suitable Land for Manure Application in Wisconsin Nutrient Management Plans must be developed or approved by a certified Nutrient Management Planner. The NMPs are very site specific and spreading MSDs are determined based on topography, crop, location of water SOurces etc ... The only minimum separation distance required on very operation is 30.48m from any domestic wells. 93 Buffer strips must be used to separate watercourses from runoff carrying eroded soil and manurt:, particles. 94 Priority areas for land application of wastes should be on gentle slopes located as far as possible from waterways. When wastes are applied on more sloping land or land adjacent to waterways, other conservation practices should be installed to reduce the potential for off-site transport of wastes. 95 Land application requirements are based on type of manure and method of application. Please see Appendix 3.23 for Required Separation Distances. 96 91.44m: losing streams,30.48m: pemlanent streams, 15.24: intermittent streams 97 7.6m unless it is defined as a Specially Protected Stream, in that case it is 30.48m 98 Manures that are injected Or surface applied with immediate incorporation can be closer than 4S.72m as long as conservation practices are used to protect against runoff and erosion. 99 When applied within 30.48m must construct buffer strips or incorporate.

100 Do not apply manure where there is less than 2S.4cm of soil over bedrock. Where the soil is only 2S.4cm to SO.8cm thick over bedrock do not apply more than 2S tons of manure and incorporate within 3 days. Do not apply manure to these soils when they are frozen. lUI A 4S.72m MSD is required if manure is land applied by an irrigation system. A IS.24m MSD is required ifmanure is land applied by tank wagon or solid

s~reader.

On protected lands and on sloping lands both within 24 hours Incorporation of manure as soon as possible after application of manure, is highly recommended and is required when the slope of the land is 6% or greater. 104 No application allowed if a potential risk of discharge to ground or surface waters exist. 105 Never apply manure to bare com fields (except whole solid and separated solids) from the beginning of September to late February. 106 If application on frozen or snow-covered land is necessary it can only be applied on land that has a slope ofless than or equal to 4% 107 Manure may not be applied on frozen or snow-covered ground on fields with shallow soils that are 20 inches thick or less over fractured bedrock. 108 When soils are frozen do not apply manure to fields with greater than 12% slope. If manure is applied to frozen fields with 6-12% slope, conservation measures must be in place.

Non-normal Conditions

III Application rates should be determined based upon the ability of the soil to accept and store the water and the ability of plants growing in the application area to utilize nutrients. Land application should be done when the water can be beneficially used by a growing crop. 112 For grassland or pastureland, apply manure at least 30 days before cutting to allow die-off of disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Manure applied within 7 days after each subsequent cutting reduces the likelihood of smothering grass and slowing re-growth. 113 Manure application by a traveling gun, center pivot. or other irrigation equipment that allows liquid application of manure to travel more than 15.24m in the air is prohibited in special protection areas. 114 An alternative to a storage pond is a structure for settling solids and an infiltration area (or vegetative filter) for handling lot runoff, milk parlor or milk house wastewater. The vegetated area may be either a long. grassed, slightly sloping channel. or a broad, flat area with little or no slope surrounded by a berm or dike. All outside surface water should be excluded from the infiltration area so that the only water applied is lot runoff and direct precipitation. Vegetation should be maintained and harvested at least once per year to prevent excessive nutrient buildup in the soil of the infiltration area. 115 Discharge or leaching into a watercourse is not allowed unless the discharge occurs as a result of the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event; or the discharge occurs as a result of a chronic rainfall event. 116 On sands or loamy sands, apply manure only where a cover crop will be established or after October 31 SI when soil temperatures are probably less than 50°F.

126 Spreading is prohibited when fields next to a watercourse, spring or borehole where the surface is severely compacted or water logged or have a steep slope and the soil is at field capacity, or the field has a moderate slope but has only a moderately permeable soil. 127 This is very site dependent. Application is allowed on land with up to a 15° slope but only if the soil, land, and climatic factors are of acceptable risk and no risk to local water quality. 128 There are maximum amounts of manure that can be applied in the autumn, these include: 30 tonnes/ha of solid manure, 20 tonnes/ha of cow slurry, 15 tOllnes/ha of pig slurry, or 10 tonnes/ha of poultry or fur animal manure.

135 The results demonstrated the presence of E. coli 0 157:H7 in 70% of soil samples after 85 days and in 20% of soil samples after 99 days. This study shows that survival strongly depends on soil type. 136 Because of rain events most E. coli was found in runoff and drainage. 137 The authors note that there is a possibility that the E. coli was deposited in sheep feces up to 14 weeks previous to the study and therefore the estimate of 15 weeks survival may be low. 138 Calculated using an exponential regression analysis to zero counts. 139 The results of the two experiments with the varying soil pH show that survival is greater in a soil that is more neutral.

These observations were taken at a depth of 10cm. The E. coli also penetrated into the soil and was present in the plots for 13 years. 142 Concluded that increasing the organic content of the soil caused an increase in the longevity of coliforms in the soil. 143 This study compared the survival of E. coli 0 157:H7 in autoclaved and unautoclaved soil. Autoclaved soil was used as a control to minimize the influence of indigenous soil microorganisms on the survival and growth of E. coli 0 157:H7. Microorganisms naturally occurring in soil had an effect on survival as all survival times of autoclaved soil were greater than the survival times in unautoclaved soil. All of the data in this matrix represents the results of the unautoclaved soils.

156 These concentrations represent the geometric mean of the indicator bacteria in the tile drainage water. 157 The concentrations in parentheses represent the maximum amount of indicator bacteria found in the tile drainage water. 158 This transport led to a cumulative loss of E. coli to drains of7% +/- 4% of applied E. coli. This would calculate to be 3.7 x 10 3 0rganisms/ml. 159 This application rate was converted from the one given in the study of 151/m2 · 160 At the 45-50cm depth, 13 organisms/g were detected, and at 95-1 OOcm depth. 1 organism /g of soil was detected. The study concluded that although the persistence of the E. coli was found to last 7 months, it seems that the majority of the spread of the E. coli population could not survive long enough to be transported to soil levels greater than 50cm deep. 100cm was the maximum depth tested. 161 After 22 hours of rain the leachate in the tilled soils contained over 2.0 x 10 7 CFU/I OOml.

Maidencane is a species recommended for constructed wetlands. 189 Based on the number of FC and TC that were inoculated. these log reductions would not meet water quality standards. The authors note that during dry periods in the summer and fall, TC and FC did not move past 15m in any of the buffer zones. I'll) This rate of rainfall is considered to be a 1 in 10 year stoml in Kentucky, therefore heavier rainfall was simulated. 191 The vegetated buffer strips were efficient at trapping sediment loads, and trapped 99% of the soil in the runoff from the erosion strips. These results cannot be unifonnly extended to fecal colifomls in the same runoff, the strips only trapped up to 74% of the fecal colifonns. This may have to do with size differences. Fecal colifonns were found in the runoff at greater than 200/1 OOml. 192 There were three different buffer strips tested: 1) 13.72mlong. 2) 27.43m long + 13.72 m offeedlot, and 3) 21.34 m long and 13.72 m of feedlot. Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorous were reduced by 83 and 84%. respectively.

193 Recommended bacteriological standards for surface waters for the public water supply-and general recreational use are 1.000 TCiIOOmL and 200 FC/IOOmL. (Based on a United States Department ofInterior report on water quality.) 194 After a filter length of6.lm the runoff exhibited no measurable concentration of fecal colifonns. 195 The average effectiveness of VFS computed for all lengths and replications was 61 % for TSS. 196 The average etTectiveness ofVFS computed for all lengths and replications was 58% for Fe. 197 The vegetative filter strips alone were not adequate to meet the recreational water quality standard of 200 FCIl OOml. in all water samples taken. FC were greater than 20011 OOml.
