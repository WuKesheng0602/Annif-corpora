The Department of Architectural Science Collaborative Exercise
Each year, at the start of the winter semester, undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff, and invited guests come together to take part in the annual Collaborative Exercise (CEx) held at the Department of Architectural Science at Ryerson University. The five-day event challenges students to address an important contemporary issue. The intention of the exercise is to engage students to collaborate, think and design, while investigating a topic related to architecture and the built environment. Through this experience, students have the opportunity to work with students from other years in the Department's program, to achieve a common design goal. The Collaborative Exercise ends with an exhibition at the Paul H. Cocker Gallery in the Ryerson University's Architecture Building. This book showcases the outcomes of the 2014 Collaborative Exercise, entitled Heat! Cooling spaces for high-rise palces. I congratulate the students and faculty on their great work.

Heat! Cooling spaces for high-rise places

"Toronto can expect an almost five-fold increase in three-day heat waves and an increased risk of more severe or prolonged heat events by 2050, as a result of climate change. It is estimated that current heat conditions contribute to an average of 120 premature deaths per year in Toronto. Average annual heat-related deaths could double by 2050 and triple by 2080."

Introduction
The 2017 Collaborative Exercise (CEx17) examined design options for outdoor Cooling Centres that would reduce risk from extreme heat to vulnerable populations living in multiunit high-rise residential buildings. Toronto is expecting a five-fold increase in three-day heat waves by 2049, leaving the City's vulnerable populations ­ the frail, elderly and isolated people ­ at great risk of heat-related health impacts. Toronto Public Health (TPH) has been proactively addressing this issue and embarked on a research project to identify options to reduce risks from extreme heat to vulnerable populations living in multi-unit residential buildings. A consultant report, prepared for TPH, identified best available information about options to reduce health risk from extreme heat for residents of multi-unit residential buildings in Toronto. The report identified a number of options for cooling. Most relate to addressing design and environmental issues in the design of existing buildings. One option, however, addresses the question from a site perspective, namely the provision of on-site cooling stations (Toronto, 2015). To develop the potential form and design for these cooling stations, CEx17 invited student to design on-site Cooling Centres ­ places that would provide thermal comfort to high-rise building occupants and be accessible to community residents during periods of extreme heat. The Cooling Centre designs would provide a combination of shading, seating, splash pads and other amenities that would give comfort to residents as required on Toronto's hot summer days. The focus of design would be passive cooling, which would provide thermal comfort to Cooling Centre users with low or nil energy consumption. The Cooling Centres would be situated on the property and near residential buildings, allowing for ease of access by building residents and encouraging community use. There are approximately 1,200 high-rise building sites to which this design exercise might apply. Three sites were identified as generic / typical sites for Cooling Centres. On these sites, typical locational conditions were identified, which were to be applied to the design of Cooling Centres across Toronto. In CEx17, student teams developed design proposals for these locations during the four-day exercise at the start of the Architectural Science January 2017 winter term. Designs were developed through drawing and modelling, and final design proposals were presented in models and on panels with explanatory text. Student designs were on view in the Paul H. Cocker Gallery from 13 January to 27 January 2017. At its core, CEx17 asked students to address the following questions: What effective passive design interventions can be created to provide outdoor Cooling Centres on sites adjacent to older inner-suburban high-rise buildings in Toronto? How can architects contribute to the design of these outdoor Cooling Centres to provide places that provide comfort and relief in periods of extreme heat, and are well designed, safe, inviting to a wide variety of users and have a low-energy impact?

Project Rationale
The City of Toronto contains almost 1,200 high-rise apartment towers built between 1945 and 1984, many of which are found in Toronto's inner suburbs. These towers are home to diverse communities and are located in neighbourhoods that show trends towards increased poverty, isolation, lack of economic opportunity, social need and health risks (Toronto, 2012). Most of these towers lack centralized cooling plants

6

and during periods of extreme heat in the summer, residents experience inordinate discomfort. Toronto's Medical Officer of Health (MOH) has identified concerns with the health risks from high temperatures inside apartment building units that do not have air conditioning (Toronto, 2015). At the direction of the Toronto Board of Health (BOH), Toronto Public Health (TPH) is working with City departments to explore strategies to mitigate extreme heat such as onsite cooling spaces in buildings and their adjacent properties. In support of the BOH and TPH, the Instructor, on behalf of Ryerson University, undertook to effect a design exercise through the Department of Architectural Science's (DAS) annual Collaborative Exercise (CEx), which invited students to investigate the design of outdoor Cooling Centres. The 2017 Collaborative Exercise (CEx17) focused on three generic sites. Within these sites, typical locations were identified for the Cooling Centres where architectural interventions were to be designed. While the sites are real and specific, the intention of CEx17 was for students to develop generic approaches to the design of onsite Cooling Centres, which may be utilized as prototypes for outdoor cooling facilities across Toronto. The outcomes from student designs developed in CEx17 were intended to support the development of design parameters for interventions. It is expected that work from CEx17 would comprise part of a larger study leading to the development of design standards and approaches for heat mitigation in Toronto's high-rise apartment towers and their sites. The project received funding from Ryerson University's Centre for Urban Research and Land Development at Ryerson University (CUR) and was supported by Toronto Public Health. In addition to the CEx17, the project included a documentary film on the impact of excessive heat on the

7

quality of life of occupants in high-rise buildings. The film, Heat! cooling spaces for highrise places, was a collaboration of the DAS and the Ryerson School of Image Arts (SIA). In the summer of 2016 and under the direction of the course Instructor, filmmaker Peter Conrad, a graduate student in SIA, worked with Christopher Marleau, DAS graduate student, to document the impact of excessive heat on residents of high-rise buildings. The film was premiered during CEx17 and was on view in the Paul H. Cocker Gallery. A discussion on documentary filmmaking and the making of Heat! cooling spaces for highrise places, occurred during CEx17. Umberto Berardi, DAS AssociateProfessor, was a Co-investigator on the project and spoke on his research during CEx17. Following the completion of CEx17, student designs were utilized in focus group discussions with community residents on their suitability to address community resident needs. The focus groups took take place in the spring of 2017 and results are currently being analyzed. The film portion of the study was approved by Ryerson University's Research Ethics Board (REB), (REB2016-255). The focus group portion of the study was also approved by Ryerson's REB, (REB2016-315) and TPH REB (REB2016-10).

encountered complex challenges (Gower, 2011). Therefore, the City is investigating alternate strategies that permit property owners to meet a maximum heat standard through the provision, at minimum, of a cool location where building occupants can go during hot weather. In July 2011, TPH undertook a community design charrette on one property to explore practical design strategies in and around the public space of a building that would support long-term planning of the site. The project engaged residents to identify opportunities for property renewal but the specific question of heat mitigation was not addressed (TPH, 2011). To advance the idea of on-site cooling, CEx17 focused on developing design strategies directed at mitigating extreme heat for residents of high-rise buildings, with a particular focus on outdoor Cooling Centres. The project was designed to assist property owners address issues of energy planning and costs through developing alternate strategies for cooling in periods of extreme heat. The project forms part of the larger question of infrastructure renewal aimed at high-rise housing and the development of methods of providing cooling during heat alerts. Mitigating impacts of extreme heat is a key project component. Continuing in the tradition of past Collaborative Exercises, which addressed a number of important topics related to architectural issues and the public interest, including `Civility' (2013), `Identity' (2014), and `Water' (2016), CEx17 addressed the topic of `Heat'.

Issues and context ­ making a valuable contribution towards shaping urban policies in Toronto
The City of Toronto sets minimum heat requirements in rental housing during winter months. There are currently no provisions for maximum temperatures in rental housing in summer months. The City has considered establishing standards for maximum heat in apartment buildings. The idea of creating regulations that would legislate a maximum heat standard for apartment dwellers without air conditioning has

The Collaborative Exercise 2017
The sites
The design of outdoor Cooling Centres in CEx17 focused on three high-rise residential sites located in Toronto's inner suburbs. The exact addresses and locations of these sites were not relevant to CEx17, as the three sites were chosen as typical of the approximately 1,200 high-rise sites where outdoor Cooling Centres may be located. The sites display characteristics typical of older high-rise buildings located in the inner suburbs. The high-rise buildings contain from 200 ­ 300 residential units in a mix of bachelor, one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Typically these are rental buildings. The instructor secured the permission of the owners of these properties to utilize these sites for CEx17. However, as there were issues of privacy and respect for the residents, the instructor did not disclose the exact locations of these sites. Adequate information on each site was provided on D2L, the Ryerson University digital learning portal. Each of the high-rise building sites presented four typical locations where an outdoor Cooling Centre could be placed. Students were to assume that all locations at each site had access to power and water. The following were the typical locations and location requirements and / or restrictions:

Typical PARKING -- Must address the question of heat buildup on location Within an existing pavement and may require a raised platform. 1 paved parking area -- No excavation allowed into the pavement for plantings or water features. -- Must be accommodated within the existing flow of vehicular traffic and not block emergency routes. -- Plant and / or water features must be PARKING constructed on the platform and / or at grade. -- Must provide for a raised, well-drained area in the event of inclement weather.

Student teams were assigned one of the three sites (Site A, Site B or Site C). Within each site, teams were assigned one of the four location types (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4). No changes were permitted. Typical locations for the Cooling Centre designs were identified on site materials posted on the D2L site.

Students were asked to address the question of sensitivity between different types of users and potential conflicts that might arise when the site is programmed for a mix of users. The following were the proposed user groups:
User Group 1 Parents with young children (i.e. children under 12 years of age) Teenagers

Project Description
Heat: Creating Outdoor Cooling Centres

CEx17 took its cues from the growing concern about climate change and the ways in which episodes of extreme heat will impact Torontonians. CEx17 invited students to design an outdoor Cooling Centre on a specific type of location on one of the three typical high-rise sites found in Toronto's inner suburbs. The Cooling Centres were to be designed in such a way to provide a range of residents of high-rise buildings the opportunity to seek respite during periods of extreme heat in the summertime in Toronto. The Cooling Centre was to provide basic amenities to users that would provide them comfort during a heat alert. It was recommended that the Cooling Centre be open 24 hours / day, 7 days / week, and be accessible to building residents on a priority basis. Other residents in the surrounding community might also access the Cooling Centre. Student design teams therefore were also to address questions of security, roundthe-clock use and the implications of mixing user types in the Centre's design. The Cooling Centres were to cater to a wide range of individuals representing the spectrum of high-rise apartment dwellers in Toronto. Therefore and to focus the design, four specific user groups were identified. Each team was assigned

User Group 2

User Group 3

Adults

User Group 4

The elderly

In all cases, there might be a mix of ethnic groups and a range of abilities within these groups. Students were to be mindful of these issues as they developed their designs.
Project Drivers

A major thrust of this project was to seek ways in which to explore ideas of passive cooling and the use of water, plant materials and shade (either natural or constructed) as elements in the design of the Cooling Centres. Each Cooling Centre would have access to water and electricity but was not to be energy dependent for cooling. These were not to be designed as "air conditioned" rooms but rather as places that provided comfort and respite during periods of extreme heat. Therefore, as a means for participants in CEx17 to explore the potential for passive cooling in these outdoor Cooling

10

Centres, each team was asked to consider encapsulating passive cooling, which would provide thermal comfort to Cooling Centre users with low or nil energy consumption.
Design Considerations

Access and welcome Comfort

Students were advised that these were to be unique facilities that would bring together a variety of people who might have common needs but not necessarily share similar values, beliefs, backgrounds or interests. Students therefore were to be mindful of providing privacy and a range of spaces within the Cooling Centre to address the diversity of the populations and their individual requirements. The Cooling Centre might accommodate a cross-section of users, from individuals to small groups to large gatherings, of all ages and demographics. Therefore, the Cooling Centre might have within it a variety of zones from the intimate to the public. The design was to be considered at three scales: the Cooling Centre, its immediate context (e.g. an area within 20 meters of its focus), and its larger context (e.g. extended vistas, views from within the site and from the larger urban context).

Program requirements
Design Objectives and Parameters

Each team was tasked to design an outdoor Cooling Centre that would provide comfort to a range of residents during periods of extreme heat. Different groups might have different needs and these needs were to be accommodated. For each Cooling Centre, students were to consider the following design issues:

For the Cooling Centres to be used by residents, the designs must demonstrate that they are accessible and welcoming places. Thermal comfort is important in these centres. As they are not to be "air conditioned" and are to use passive means of cooling, using low to no energy, students must demonstrate that comfort is achieved in their proposed design. Create a space where users may feel secure and welcome. If the decision is taken that the Cooling Centre may be in operation 24 hours per day, students must address the question of security of users around-the-clock. Create a space where users may engage in recreational activities, either individually or collectively. This may be in the form of quiet reading or group activities, including engaging with water recreationally, or other activities requiring more exertion. Different age groups may have different recreational needs and students should be mindful of this. Be capable of accommodating the needs of diverse cultural and ethnic groups and communities. Provide basic functional needs such as seating, resting/relaxing and toileting. Other activities may be incorporated, such as information functions, capacity to access internet, public telephone or charge individual portable computer devices or telephones. The facility may include a shower for individual bathing as appropriate. Provide the opportunity for individuals to find comfort and privacy, albeit in a public or quasi-public setting. Provide the opportunity for people to undertake sociable activities in small groups. Provide information to users on possible heat-related or publicservice related issues.

Project Scope and Considerations

The following were the dimensional and area considerations each Cooling Centre design: · A space of approximately 100 m2 which will form the core of the Cooling Centre, capable of accommodating 15 ­ 20 people. · If 24 hour use is proposed, present ways the space may be secured at night to permit possible overnight sleeping by

11

· · · · ·

residents during periods of extreme heat. It must be shaded and provide coverage in inclement weather. If students believe that this area is too small or too large, they may contract or expand the area and provide a rationale for their decision. If the area is enlarged, it must not exceed the area of 200 m2 as discussed below. A larger space of approximately 200 m2 which may extend the area of influence of the Cooling Centre into the larger location. The Cooling Centre may be a one- or two-storey structure. Be mindful of accessibility requirements. The maximum height of the built area is to be no more than 8 metres.

· The Cooling Centre must have weather-protected / shaded and open / outdoor components. · The Cooling Centre is to function from late spring through early fall. Its use, function and operation may change with time (daily or seasonally). · The Cooling Centre may be a permanent or temporary facility. If permanent, provision must be made for its enclosure / security in the season when it is not in use. If temporary, the design must demonstrate how it may be demounted and stored for reassembly and use in future summer seasons. · The Cooling Centre should accommodate a multiplicity of purposes and activities that may change over time.

The following were program considerations: · The underlying premise of CEx17 is to create safe, comfortable, accessible and secure Cooling Centres that provide comfort to residents during periods of extreme heat. · Each Cooling Centre will have common program elements. · Specific program elements will be required for specific user groups and students may propose additional elements and incorporate these into their designs. · Passive cooling is to be the main means of cooling. Energy consumption for cooling is to be low or nil. · The tectonics of the Cooling Centre should be explored and clearly developed. The form and materiality of the Cooling Centre may seek to reinforce the idea of cooling. The tectonic, therefore, should consider both construction and how the choice of materials, assemblage and construction raises the architecture of the Cooling Centre to a higher meaning beyond the functional, allowing the design and object to have a significant presence.

12

Program elements
Each Cooling Centre was to include common elements for any type of user and specific user-related elements, as follows:
Common Program Elements · Water and electricity are provided · Water: pools either need 24 hour surveillance (e.g. a lifeguard) or need to be drained when there is no surveillance · Must be wading pool or splash pad (wading pools are 0.75m or less in depth) · Misting station · Drinking water fountains · Two unisex bathrooms equipped with toilet / sink and a changing station; one may include a shower · Shading: natural and constructed · Area: 100m2 secured area, 200m2 maximum footprint · An area for a person who will operate / supervise the Cooling Centre (including locked storage) · Lighting: dependant on the program (sleeping, activities, etc.) · Cooking space, including a barbeque, sink area · Garbage disposal · Assume even grading for the site · Vending machine for cool drinks · Ice machine · Refrigerator for storage of cool/cold items · Night activity permitted · Said activity to be determined by the group (active or passive) · Students must address what happens to the site during the other seasons

Research project
Keeping Cool / Designing for Cool

To start students thinking about the design of a Cooling Centre, on Monday, immediately following the kick-off, students were asked to research and present two sets of ideas about possible design strategies. Students researched the following topics and pinned up their findings in designated areas of the building.
Research Topic 1: Keeping cool from your own perspective

· Individual / Collective: how do you keep cool in hot weather? How do you and your friends and family as a group keep cool in hot weather?
Research Topic 2: Keeping cool from the design perspective

· What are architectural / design strategies for passive cooling? · What natural and / or constructed elements may support cooling? · What materials may be appropriate for use in a Cooling Centre? The results of these preliminary investigations informed student design work through the CEx17.
Project Deliverables, Submission Requirements and Deadlines

Students had four days to complete their work, during the period of 9 ­ 12 January 2017. All designs were submitted digitally and posters were printed for public display in the Paul H. Cocker Gallery. Students also submitted a monochromatic model at a scale of 1:50 metric, and constructed of cardboard and wood. Sheets of blue, green and white paper were provided to students to be used to designate

14

water, plant materials and hard surfaces, respectively. A public exhibition of the student designs was mounted in the Gallery for a three-week period following the Collaborative Exercise. Students were invited to give their project, as a type, a name CEx17 was experimental in that it was proposing ideas about Cooling Centres that would provoke the public to think about how outdoor cooling could be effected during periods of extreme heat. In conceiving of this project, the project team thought of a number of names for this new type of place, but came up short. So, they challenged each team to propose a unique name for their Cooling Centre.
"Cool Designers", "Cool Cats" and "Heat Advisors"

Outcomes
The following pages present the varied takes by students on the question of mitigating extreme heat through the design of outdoor Cooling Centres. Following its completion, the student outcomes were presented to focus groups held with residents in the community. The outcomes of these focus groups are currently undergoing analysis.

Students from the Bachelor of Architectural Science undergraduate program were divided into 15 sections of approximately 30 students and each section consisted of two teams of approximately 15 students each, drawn from all years in the undergraduate B. Arch. Sci. program. Each team appointed two team co-leaders who were responsible for the administration of the team and the delivery of the outcome of the CEx17. Students within each team became "Cool Designers," responsible for developing and shaping the Cooling Centre that would reflect upon the project requirements that were to be executed. Student sections were led by "Cool Cats", graduate students from the Department's graduate programs. Department faculty and guests were designated as "Heat Advisors," encouraging the articulation and development of the design. And, just for fun, the project leaders, Joe Ball, Isabelle Gunn or Ishan Patel, agreed to be named "Hot Dawgs" for the duration of CEx17.

We established principles of our design by breaking down their functions into the 5 categories of the senses. For sight, we investigated how imagery can trick the mind into feeling colder. We concluded that the colours blue and white affiliate with ice and winter, therefore are best applicable for the design. Furthermore, the flow of water is often associated with a cool and refreshing sensation. The main element for sight is water. For hearing we decided to use both water and air; the sound of water flowing, the wind passing through the water, the water splashing. Moreover, for taste we continued with water and included earth. The taste and scent of herbs such as mint, citrus, teas (hot and cold), spicy foods (in some cultures) and ice aid the body to emit heat and cool down. Finally there is touch, possibly the most essential because it incorporates all of the 3 constants. The feeling of mist on one's skin, or the wetness of water and cool grass on one's feet all decrease temperature. The use of elements to accentuate the cold sensation that is experienced through the 5 senses is the most efficient way to keep the tenants of the apartment buildings cool.

Cooling down is not simply just physical, for it is also psychological and spiritual. Our pavilion explores the use of the five senses through the interaction of elements. Earth, water and air are constants that were used for ancient methods of cooling in various cultures. By integrating each sense with these constants, our pavilion promotes a multitude of cooling techniques for all ages.

Koolhaus cooling centre is an effective yet environmentally sustainable space designed to accommodate people of diverse backgrounds. The space is available for use to anyone who needs a place to cool off during extreme weather conditions during the summer months such as heat waves. The design is comprised of an interior space and an exterior one, which each take up roughly half of the total area of the centre. Passive cooling is achieved in our centre through cross-ventilation thanks to the stacked, hollow modules that contour the building. The modules which are made up of pressure treated wood, can be moved to create additional seating and countertop space, and the appearance of the façade can be changed as well. The exterior is comprised of a wading pool lined with seating, which is an ideal spot for parents to relax while their kids play. Additionally, the amphitheatre style seating created by the stacked modules makes for an excellent spot for teenagers to cool off in the shade while socializing with friends. Within the interior space, there is a private area complete with cushioned seating for anyone who would like to read a book, check email using our high-speed Wi-Fi, or simply relax. On the right wing is a social space in which community members can get to know each other, play board games, enjoy a cool drink and more. The unisex bathroom is located between the private and public wings of the cooling centre. Finally, there are booths where up to three volunteers will be working during the centre's hours of operation to provide safety and information to community members. Overall, Koolhaus is a modern, serene oasis of relaxation for residents of all ages and backgrounds.

Convective heat transfer techniques are used to maintain cool activity areas while natural ventilation is also induced through a dynamic arrangement of wall openings. The porous platform deck, which hovers over a shallow water pool contained by the pavilion boundaries, adds an additional level of evaporative cooling. Through passive cooling techniques and careful program organization, CANOPY achieves a sustainable and inviting space to bring comfort and shelter to all its users throughout Toronto's scorching summer season.

CANOPY is a cooling station proposal designed for both the residents of the apartments adjoining the lot, and the general public. Located on the westernmost `grassy' area on the site, the proposal borrows heavily from the thick existing natural canopy, supplementing this shade with a thinner, more porous canopy of its own. In doing so, it encloses two rooms to the north and the south of the station ­ one provides opportunity to rest and nap with molded concrete reclining seats, while the other features tiered seating with Wi-Fi and charging stations for reading, contemplation, and conversation. The central platform is open and boasts a barbeque pit for more active socialization.

Slither is a passive activity center for the elderly. Slither provides relief from the heat of the summer, while promoting community engagement amongst the primary senior user group, as well as the secondary adult and teen visitor groups. Situated on a grassy island amidst gentle flora and other vegetation, Slither presents an easily accessible location, equidistant to the two high-rise senior homes on its sides and bordering directly on a larger, more active central community space. Slither functions as one unified, continuous ramp at a shallow slope of 1:15, weaving around and in between the existing trees of the site in a symbiotic exchange of canopy-style shading along the ramp for public interest in the community preservation of the trees. Along the path of the ramp is a network of comfortable seating installations, benefitting the space by providing both the opportunity for the elderly to take breaks and rest along their walks, and the appropriate vantage points to observe the activities taking place in the spaces below. There are two general activity spaces, shaded by an elegant roof hosting an interchangeable myriad of activities appropriate for both the elderly population it serves, and the hot weather it faces. Washrooms are located under the tallest point of the ramp.

Slither facilitates many passive cooling techniques, including breathable spaces, natural shade, vegetation, water features, and cross-ventilation. The arboreal shading along the ramp and within the activity spaces, as well as the latticed rooftops, creates cool spaces naturally while benefitting the environment. Misting stations set up inside the activity centers provide passive methods of regulated cooling. Ventilation due to wind assists in cooling. Overall, Slither functions as a breathable, relaxing space for relief from the heat and more enjoyable community interaction.

The cooling centre provides parents and children an area of comfort, relief, and relaxation from scorching temperatures in dense urban areas. The primary purpose is to provide a space for children and their parents while simultaneously providing a recreational and social place. Teenagers and other adults are also welcome to use the space for similar needs throughout the three seasons where it will be in use.

The form is reminiscent of the existing residential towers, and its orientation draws the public to this gathering space. Utilizing the existing vegetation in addition to using light coloured wooden louvers as the cladding of the structures, its orientation focuses on preventing solar radiation with the aid of a wading pool to cool down the area. The wading pool is situated between the two main zones used as social spaces. The enclosed structure on the south side of the site is used as a changing area, administration office, and first aid centre. The second structure is semi-enclosed and is located on the north side where a barbecue, tables, and chairs are provided as a lounge. The wading pool is a stream of water that is continually moving and uses evaporated pooling to cool down its users. The wooden louvers used on the exterior of the structures are light coloured for its reflective quality to reduce the amount of sunlight in the area.

Kanöpy is an exploration of how passive design strategies, and design with minimal impact can help make beautiful spaces. The design aims to synergize with nature to bring shade, natural ventilation, and the cooling potential of water and vegetation to the area. The intention is to provide a comfortable climate that goes beyond just being a cooling centre and becomes a gatherings space for the community.

A large amount of space, and seamless integration into the surrounding context turns the building into a catalyst for community engagement and connections. Kanöpy does more than just fulfilling the task of an enclosure designed for Torontonians without A/C. It becomes a symbol for community, health, and comfort.

Integrated into a pre-existing tree canopy the design acts as an extension of the shade provided by nature. The openness of the project, further allows for opportunities for natural ventilation and cool air from the ravine to help bring down the temperature of the area. Finally, the greenery and water features placed throughout the area also help to keep the temperature at an enjoyable level.

The site is located at the rear of the building. The space was segregated into four sectors, each one providing a varying level and method of cooling. The sectors are intended to provide a full cooling experience, from west to east. The shadow of the apartment, as well as the extended canopy provides shading to the sectors. A path was constructed to run across each sector, connecting to the existing path on the east side and the parking lot. Moss also grows along the sides of the path as a cooling effect. Benches and drinking fountains are scattered along the south side of the path to offer seating and hydration for cooling. The fourth and eastern-most sector has water fountains, which provide hydration for those who are just walking along the neighbourhood path. The third sector has seating space placed around the tree, providing shade and a gathering space. The second sector consists of picnic tables for additional lounging areas. The first and western most sector is where the pavilion is situated. It offers the most intense method of cooling, by engaging the senses and offering more seating space. The cooling center is designed to maximize wind flow and air circulation with its shape and open columns. A water wall is located on its south side, creating mist and adding a cooling physical and psychological effect. Seating spaces are also in the pavilion as a place for the residents to relax.

The elderly are the primary user group. With accessibility in mind, the pavilion provides the elderly with shaded seating, while simultaneously allowing for diverse heat mitigation opportunities, such as physical water immersion. There are three different wading pools scattered throughout the site that provide different levels of interaction: one that can oversee the secondary user group, second that is catered towards visual connectivity, while the last one is more private.

In this secluded area of the site, the pavilion emulates, reflects, and extends the surrounding context. The shape and positioning of the pavilion and proposed landscaping ultimately emulates and reflects the ravine that is located just north of the site, while the trellises do not only provide shading, but can also be seen as an extension of the tree canopy that is heavily located to the north of the site. The reflected river is then broken up into three sections in which the trellis-covered path weaves from west to east through the site, ultimately connecting the parking lot and the trail located on the East side. Different types of `zones' are then created, aiming to achieve various levels of heat mitigation, while simultaneously creating a variety of public and private spaces.

Utilizing the strong prevailing winds on site, the children's splash pad is located on the West side not only for more public access and visual connections, but to create a more natural mist effect throughout the site and pathway. The proposed pavilion and landscaping aim to offer heat mitigation opportunities at different levels of interaction, whilst activating the more secluded and private areas of the site.

This project was conceived as a year-round residents' amenity that serves a range of user groups regardless of age. The form acts as a gateway to an existing outdoor amenity area with a basketball court; a "transplanted" parkette to reduce urban heat island effect, shelter interior cooling centre spaces, and allow a safe place for children to play separate from the parking lot.

Our project was placed at the south of the site to locate it adjacent to existing basketball courts/pavilion and to define the south end as the site closer to the street. It is located conveniently for the access to both towers, roughly equidistant from each. A duality of program led to the creation of two separate spaces, with a breezeway located between to maintain seamless pedestrian connection to existing basketball courts. The breezeway with "water walls" provides a cooling mist to walk through when coming and going from the site (i.e. returning from errands, residents get a cool breeze as they walk through the pavilion breezeway and toward the apartment building entrance). This project is an open, flexible space with re-arrangeable furniture, with a .duality of spaces: an activity space (ideal for youth or children) and a quiet space. This project is anticipated as a space where children can play on the landscaped/topographical roof, separated from the parking lots around it. Aults can work in the quiet area and keep an eye on their children as they use the activity space.

The Activity Space fulfills the promise of a year-round amenity for apartment tower residents ­ cooking/dining functions, party room functions, youth drop-in programming and after-school programing possibilities. The Quiet Space serves as a year-round work area and retreat from the sometimes cramped conditions of apartment living, especially in suburban towers where large families reside in undersized apartments.

The architectural design of this cooling centre makes use of organic curves as a dynamic transitional space for the various users of the site. With the intention of getting elderly people safely between their homes and the assumed recreational centre, this long canopy helps to protect the pedestrians during the winter months from snow and ice, and in the summer it helps to create a shaded walkway to shield from direct sunlight. The cooling centre itself is comprised of both an open and closed space, as a representation of the contrast between the site's demographics and the activities in which they typically engage. The closed space is designed for the elderly and consists of a long table for recreational events, a seating area, washrooms, an office and a mechanical room. Its east and west walls house large rotating doors which are able to swing open in the summer and allow for the prevailing wind to work its way through the centre and cool it down. The east side doors open to a canopy with a waffle style modular structure which is covered in vines and greenery over the summer and swapped with zinc panels for protection over the winter. It consists of a BBQ and picnic area for the families to use throughout the summer and a jungle gym, sand box, and tumbling area for young children. The two spaces have a strong visual connection to one another through large glass doors and windows on the west side, while still creating two distinct spaces. Lastly, trees and greenery were planted throughout the parking in order to create shade for the parking spots, as well as to help keep the area cool through transpiration cooling. The concrete itself is sourced from Durable Grass, a company providing a permeable, flexible, concrete pavement system with a low moisture absorption and help decrease the Heat Island Effect by allowing for more usable land and helping with storm water management.

The design of this pavilion is greatly focused on the relationship and interaction between children, their parents and the surrounding residential community. The goal is to unite fun and comfort in the experience of the space, appropriately dealing with various age groups.

This seasonal, versatile and fully accessible pavilion offers: an open, multipurpose space surrounded by stair and bench seating, a pond and waterfall cooling system, storage and user information, an area for dining, as well as a BBQ area, 2 bathrooms, a shower and changing space, a storage/ control room, and a nearby splash pad and park at grade. The depth of the pavilion reaches 1m below grade, taking advantage of the lower temperature of the earth and providing a cooling sensation to users. This height difference enables parents and guardians to keep an eye on children playing outside, whether at the splash pad or on the grass area, while in the comfort of shade and seating. The flooring throughout the pavilion, including slope and stairs, consists of durable, anti-slip and easy to maintain rubber tiles. In consideration of the local climate, the design offers users with a shaded, roofed space for easy transition and movement between the hot sun exposure and the cooled, shaded space. This control of the atmosphere ensures that user comfort is a priority in the summer season. The design also has a water filtration system that works to provide the pond and nearby splash pad with clean, cool water in the operating summer months. Rainwater is collected from the roof, with a constant supply of water provided by the city for the servicing, and flows down the slope into selective openings that allow it to fall into the ponds below. This water flows through the ponds, offering visitors cooling by the evaporation process. It is then filtered through a UV system and transferred into the splash pad, providing children with clean, cool water. The openness of the structure also ensures that there is constant airflow and ventilation in the space, bringing in cool breezes and filtering out the warmth to reduce the impact of the heat.

The TOIT VERT pavilion is a permanent community space which uses passive cooling methods to provide residents with refuge from summer heat waves. A public centre for people of all ages, it features a bathroom, kitchenette, and a large area of flexible space, which can be transformed based on the community's needs. The pavilion also contains many elements designed for teenagers, including game tables, a portable large-screen projector, and a quiet study space. The centre aims to provide a space for teenagers to relax and gather with friends away from the summer heat. With a vast amount of thermal mass and a green roof, the pavilion naturally retains comfortable temperatures throughout the year. The thermal mass stays a consistent temperature, moderating the temperature of the air in the enclosed space. Strategically placed louvers encourage natural sunlight to flow through the space while deflecting heat. In the summer, a shallow wading pool, shaded by a wooden terrace additionally cools the space while also allowing patrons to relax in the cool water.

The TOIT VERT pavilion remains temperate during all four seasons and can be used throughout the year. In the winter, the wading pool transforms into a skating rink, while the enclosed space continues to be a gathering place for community activities.

Nestled within a lush canopy of trees, Sombra is located on the north-west corner of Site B. Using an undulating form it denotes both a space and a walkway for residents of the property to claim as their own. It aims to provide access to cooling for tenants of the nearby apartment buildings through the use of passive cooling. Nature is the main driving factor for the design of the pavilion because of its positive effects on the wellbeing of the occupants; psychologically and physically. Using the local tree canopy as inspiration, a palette of passive materials coupled with a small stream of water aim to create a more pleasant microclimate, in turn lowering stress levels. It respects the site context by following the rhythm of the trees and through its orientation to the south, overlooking the park. The nearby trees and vines will be used as shading devices and noise reduction systems. A water stream will be incorporated along the pathway to guide the visitors to the central pond. The pavilion accommodates meditation, as it's an integral part of life and is beneficial to all age groups. Therefore, the space was designed to accommodate different methods of meditation for the various types of users. Recognizing the diversity of Toronto, the pathway is designed for occupants who are looking to relax and cool off individually, while the central pavilion is targeting users who want to communicate and interact with others. To provide the necessary level of safety for the users, LED lighting is incorporated through the pavilion to enhance visibility. The vertical wooden members are also oriented in a way to allow constant vision from the residential units to the south. Overall, Sombra creates a place to take a break in nature, to relax and cool off.

The design process began by addressing the site and brainstorming ideas to create passive cooling strategies that would be suitable for an already heavily shaded site, and an elderly user group. Our passive cooling strategy takes the form of a cooling wall system that encloses a main pavilion, covered by a stretched canopy covering the rest of the unshaded areas of the site. The walls of the pavilion combine wind and water as activators for passive cooling strategies. The cooling wall is composed of a sheet of fabric in between two wood lattice frames. A plumbing system is integrated into the wall and distributes water to wet the fabric. This allows wind to move through the damp fabric, cooling the enclosed pavilion space. The stretched canopy is designed to be a cover for the entire designated cooling area as well as a roof for the main pavilion. The canopy's shape is composed of multiple points that resemble a funnel, coming to a point where it touches the ground in order for any warm air to travel up and out of the pavilion through the "funnel" canopy. These points also become identifiers in the cooling centre, differentiating the program within. For this cooling centre to become elderly friendly, we placed our focus on the east end of the site in order to create the shortest possible traveling distance from the residential tower to the cooling centre. We placed seating both near the children's playground for elderly and children interaction, as well as in the north east corner of the centre for a more secluded outdoor area. The final touch to the cooling centre was to wrap a green wall along the entirety of the north side of the site for safety and privacy, as well as sound absorption from the neighboring city street.

The Orton Park Cooling Centre project began with the task of designing an outdoor cooling centre that would reduce vulnerability to extreme heat to populations living in multi-unit, high-rise residential buildings. Team 7B was given a site adjacent to a major public thoroughfare and visible from the street with a focus on the elderly as a primary user group, and parents with young children as the secondary user group.

Our project proposal of Creek Park is designed to link the apartment complex to cooling centres, providing a transitional journey to relief; hot to cold, stress to distress, discomfort to comfort. The experiential gradient is designed to gradually alleviate the pressures from the user, utilizing natural elements to stimulate the senses of the user. The water on site is ever flowing, cyclically to support the natural movement of the user and to provide a sound buffer between public and private spaces. Creek Park is elongated along the south east perimeters of the site, proposing a private, communal, and interactive space of temperate refuge to support and regulate the living conditions of apartment occupants all-seasonally. The intent was to design the cooling pavilion as a wind channel, naturally intensifying the cooling impact in and around the pavilion to moderate temperatures for users. The pavilion is complemented with small ponds of water that attribute to the wind effect, cooling the exterior environment and the occupants that interact with it. Within this park, there are interactive platforms that provide different hands-on educational modules, mimicking the control and planning of river paths. This water park is designed to promote an environment for children to learn and grow while keeping cool. Nearby, shaded seating and kitchen spaces are present to allow for appropriate parental guidance. There are several zones to accommodate for different activities and multiplicity of usership within the space. The outdoor amphitheater seating offers a quaint outdoor resting space, accompanied by the sounds of flowing water and panoramic view to the adjacent forest and stream. The multiplicity of spaces such as the barbecue pit, walking platforms, and communal dining spaces offer community and social gathering spaces that allow the residents to interact, learn, relax, and socialize.

The earth's climate is in constant flux and has changed tremendously throughout history. Recent warming trends are of particular significance due to the fact that they are a result of human activity. In large cities such as Toronto, the effects of climate change are exacerbated by the urban heat island effect. If current warming trends continue, Toronto will experience a significant increase in heat waves, the effects of which will be felt the most by users in old and poorly insulated buildings. One way to prepare for future heat waves is to design and implement cooling stations within residential complexes. Ideally, the design of these spaces should utilize passive design strategies for cooling. Passive design takes advantage of local climate and site conditions to maintain a comfortable environment. It is the foundation of good sustainable design, as it minimizes the impact on the environment. That said, perhaps the most passive building is no building at all, but rather an intervention that is seemingly integrated within nature and uses no energy. Rather than designing an active cooling station for users, our proposal guides users towards a river just adjacent to the site. The river has the potential to be a fantastic cooling amenity for users of the adjacent building complex and the public. Modules designed for specific activities for teens, adults, and the elderly will frame the weaving path that guides users through the forest to the river. Program for the modules will enable users to relax individually, gather as a group, and even cook meals. These modules will be passively shaded by the dense foliage of the surrounding trees ensuring that users remain cool at all times.

Chill Out is a proposal for a cost-efficient, modular cooling station. It is a response to the lack of cooling spaces during summer heat waves found near post-war high rises that house much of the population in Toronto's inner suburbs. Designed to occupy the vast outdoor parking spaces surrounding the towers, the modular unit is derived from a typical parking spot. Using a combination of semi-enclosed and open units, a variety of configurations are made possible, allowing for future expansion to other lots. Passive cooling is achieved by creating a module that is devoid of any solid walls, allowing for a constant breeze to pass through the space. In addition, shading is provided through the solid roof element, vegetation and vines that grow around the steel tension cables and planters. Active cooling is achieved through a misting bar found at the entrance of every module that generates a mist any time someone walks through the entrance. Electricity for the misting element and lighting is generated through photovoltaic panels found on the roof of the modules. Additionally, the roof is designed to collect rainwater that acts a constant supply for the misting.

We envision adults to be the primary user of these cooling stations, with teenagers and the elderly acting as the secondary users. To accommodate the activities of these groups within the context of a cooling station, a variety of leisure, work, and gathering spaces are provided. Each module is subdivided into three zones, intimate relaxation, circulation, and a multi-use active space. The construction of the modules is made costefficient by using dimensioned lumber and steel cables as the main structure for the cooling station. Photovoltaic panels and a rain water collection system allow for the modules to function independent of any external power source.

In our design, we've developed a Cooling Center that takes advantage of different passive cooling techniques such as the use of wind scoops, vegetation, water and expansive areas of circulation. There is also a main force of cross-ventilation that moves cool breezes to the inhabitants. The overhanging canvas canopies encompass the program spaces that serve to engage the residential patrons of the area. These canopies are mainly used to catch the direction of airflow and direct the outside wind into the depths of the open cooling center. This method of cooling is called the windcatcher approach. In order to further connect with the existing buildings and community, the canopies extend beyond the program and move into the main courtyard space within the community. They act as a shading device that invites people in as the tensile structure is also anchored between two neighboring buildings. The windcatcher approach also functions without the addition of mechanical devices in order to regulate a cool temperature in the space.

The objective of the COO[L]EAVES cooling centre was to provide accommodation to all of the main user groups, while bringing them together. The cooling centre is located on the grassy area of Site B. The structure is placed to create a private cooling station, central to all residents with the opportunity for visibility from both the surrounding buildings, to create a secure environment for the playing children. The primary user group is adults, with parents with children and the elderly included as well. In order to accommodate these three groups, quiet and active zones were designed, including a community gardening space to provide a calming and productive area for residents, as well as a splash pad for the more energetic inhabitants. The gardening system is efficiently designed for easy accessibility by all age groups. Targeting mainly to people of an elderly age, `the garden walls' are designed as multiple individual containers that are easily accessible while standing or sitting; since many elderly people are unable to crouch down for long periods of time, as well as low containers for access by children. This creates a relaxing setting for any individual. Vegetation is periodically watered through misting ­ which can simultaneously cool the users. There is also an outdoor patio, and picnic area with a screening space for movies in the evenings, as there is an increase in adult/ parent activity at that time.

The structure is shaped as two leaves which artificially recreate the cooling effects of plants through the Hydroceramic roof structure. Developed by IaaC students, this composite absorbs up to 500 times its weight in water, and expands in 400 times its volume. The smart material is highly beneficial to areas with warmer climate due to the cooling interaction between hydrogel and ceramic. The hydrogel pellets absorb then evaporate water, creating a cooling effect to its surroundings.

The spherical canopy is built of a passive-cooling material developed by students at Barcelona's Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia called Hydroceramic. The Canopy touches down on the four islands, unifying them to create a central focal point, housing specific activities under each sphere. The joining group of cubes to the south creates a transitional space between the canopy and the secured playground framing a shaded space allows for parents to observe from outside the playground. The elderly residents of the complex are encouraged to leave their hot apartments and come to the drop-off centre, located within the darker coloured blue sphere, where other residents of the complex may temporarily drop off their children with supervision. The elderly are given ample opportunity to interact with the community in a cool environment geared toward social connectivity and purposeful contribution.

Retirementland aims to reanimate social activity of the site by engaging the residents of the complex with one another and with the larger community in an environment designed to mitigate the effects of extreme heat. This project proposes to invite the larger community by weather-painting the existing pathways with a pattern that encourages movement and exploration, at the same time increasing the conductivity of the pathway and effectively decreasing the heat island effect within the courtyard.

TRI-PARK is a place of refuge from the high temperatures that occurs in the city during summer months. The pavilion is made of recycled materials and is arranged into three intersecting shapes that denote program, systems, and physical structure. Three canopies lie at varying heights above an open exterior space, two of which are a lattice structure. This allows for changing summer and winter conditions, in which plants grow to provide shade when it's warm and lose their leaves to reveal sunlight when it's cold. The lowest of the three roofs houses the washrooms, maintenance facilities and parents' seating area.

A `fan wall' is used as a barrier between the interior functions and the exterior area, functioning as a passive cooling system. As users move past the wall, the fan blades spin and provide a means of circulating the air. There is also a mist system installed on the most northwesterly wall, to take advantage of the strong northwest winds in the summer. The second canopy gives shelter to a garden with built-in seating, for the elderly. The third area includes a wading pool for children. Both the children's zone and parents zone are located adjacent to the on-site playground, in order to maintain visibility and interaction. TRI-PARK takes advantage of the site conditions and user groups in order to provide an inviting retreat from the summer's heat.

The Windcatcher pavilion is a cooling center which utilizes passive systems for ventilation and cooling. The location of the pavilion is site C adjacent to the street. The structure's primary user is teenagers but will also be suitable for adults and children. The structure is composed of two large compressive masses made from concrete. The structure is formed from the junction of the street, building and playground creating a place to stop and cool off. The north west wind direction flows along a sunken path to create a versatile space for relaxation or events and activities. The larger suspended mass is to be used as a patio space, and the smaller is used as a climbable green roof. The manipulation of wind is incorporated into the form of the pavilion as it is guided into the open activity space. The wind is then drawn out by the higher pressure of hot air in the solar chimney because of the heat given off by the black concrete. A water wall is featured on the south east entrance, creating sensible cooling to aid with the cooling process. There is also a water collection system situated on the green roof to collect the water that runs off the patio. The different levels of the pavilion allow for great views of it from the street and from the structure to the neighbouring playground.

The Chilled Passage Centre creates a space where people feel comfortable gathering with others in a social context. This area creates an environment that promotes relaxation to its visitors by providing relief from the unbearable heat. The building engages with the surrounding nature on site to create an environment in which people feel at peace in the outdoors. Natural elements such as vegetation and fresh air are relaxing to the human body and make us feel at one with the natural world. Considering these factors, this proposal forms the idea of a pavilion that accommodates all who choose to visit. Through a variety of different spaces, those who visit experience different levels of cooling depending on which is more inviting to them. However, all of these spaces are connected through one extending path. The path not only brings the three spaces together through linear movement but also through materiality. The wood board walkway remains a constant through every space and creates a dialogue between each area. Paths also lead into the park and connect the building to that space not only through extension of its materiality, but also through framing views. The building is solid on the side facing the parking lot while receptive to all views of the natural context on its other side. This invites users to not only use the building but also to sit in the park which is shaded by both the pavilion and the trees. The building's passive cooling approaches use water, shade and wind to cool the centre and the main building. For instance, low openings in the building create a pressure difference which moves air over the indented rivers in the ground and into the main building, leading up to the solar chimney. The Chilled Passage Centre is a transition of key moments through a linear passage that connects independent zones into a coherent cooling centre.

The aspirations of this project culminated in a minimal impact cooling pavilion, providing various cooling effects to the immediate community, with specific focus on the elderly. The pavilion itself is divided into 3 distinct zones, an air zone, a water zone and comfort zone. By incorporating passive air movements and providing live wall wind catches the pavilion can provide more than adequate cooling for even the hottest of summer days. The inclusion of an interactive mist station provides opportunity for children to play. A small kiosk proves additional benefits to users, offering cold beverages when needed. A seating area in the comfort zone is geared towards the elderly, allowing them to rest and socialize within the site. The inspiration behind the form and tectonics are informed by the adjacent slab tower, as well as, the "less is more" minimalist approach. Ideally, the pavilion acts to fully engage the community and solve the issue of extreme heat during the summer using passive cooling strategies, involving air and water.

The design is based on a contractible module, which when opened is positioned to maximize area for better heat dissipation. When completely open, the spaces forms a series of intertwining connections that direct visitors to engage in different activities within the cooling environments. Programming elements feature spaces for all ages; ranging from the elderly to adults to young parents with children. A splash pad, picnic space and resting center for the elderly are some of the uses created when the space is opened up, while stationary services such as washrooms and administration spaces remain fixed. Separated by their materiality and utilities, each space is designed to interact with each other in a non-intrusive way, and set up to provide both passive and active cooling strategies for the blazing summer heat. The program is organized on a longitudinal east-west axis that provides a frame work for a gradient in levels of activity, with louder, more public functions on the eastern portion facing the children's playground, and more private and quieter functions to the west. Using this axial gradient , space was allocated to the 3 users of the space: kids, parents and adults, and seniors area.

In the year 2016, Toronto experienced its hottest summer ever recorded. There was a sudden surge in temperature and a number of high rise complexes were unable to sustain this abrupt increase of heat. In more extreme cases, health risks have resulted on the unsuitable living conditions as a direct consequence of heat. This proposal aims to create not only a shelter from the heat, but also to stimulate connections between surrounding facilities and ultimately provide a gathering space for the nearby communities. With its main facilities focusing on adults with children, the shelter also seeks to draw in other groups through the use of circulation and program. As well, the space provides health benefits that are factored in with its materiality and form.

The splash pad provides evaporative cooling for the pavilions on days when there is not sufficient wind to achieve cross ventilation.

This design seeksw to alleviate heat exhaustion created by the lack of cooling mechanisms in apartment buildings constructed between 1940 to 1980 in Toronto. The concept is a transformation of solid to void fit into a 3-dimensional grid system whilst providing the necessary cooling mechanisms. It implicates a responsibility of its materials, structure, orientation and detail to provide a pleasurable summer. The design focuses on teenagers as the main user group and adults as well as children as secondary users. Activities are focused on relaxation and include studying, eating, mist cooling, and a splash pad to create a tranquil atmosphere. The dark color and emptiness of parking lots makes them a common location of heat buildup. The dimensions of the grid system are modules fitting into a parking spot and therefore can be assembled in various configurations and moved throughout the parking lot. The cooling mechanisms involved in the design include conduction, transpiration, convection and shading. Water vapor is present in different forms to provide alternative options of use. There is a liquid splash pad ankle deep, mist stations to cool down without fully getting wet, and a waterfall. The design incorporates vegetation planters and vines hanging from the structure to create a clean environment. Vegetation reacts to the water and provides shading. Plants rid excess water through transpiration to cool themselves and the environment. Plants also consume carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to create a fresh atmosphere. This stimulates a healthy working environment for studying teenagers, as well as cooling down our secondary users. The wind currents flow through the design to cool down the surrounding area. Varying within the grid system are alternate mechanisms of shading to protect from direct sunlight. This cooling station acts to mitigate extreme heat to create a tranquil comfortable exterior environment.

The objective of our design focuses on the needs and demands of the adult, while also satisfying the needs of the elderly and parents with children, which are our secondary age groups. The project is situated on Site C, with a grassy location. To accommodate such surroundings, the design utilizes the natural features by implementing an L-shaped activity space wrapping around a splash pond. The splash pond acts like a semi enclosed cooling playground for the children, while the interior activity area provides exercising and gathering spaces for the adult and elderly. The interior of the pavilion is elevated, allowing the parents to have a view to their children who are playing outdoors. As an outdoor Cooling Centre, the façade uses perforated ceramic bricks which guide wind to blow through, providing well ventilated circulation within. The bricks retain moisture and may be evaporated to create cool air. On the other side, the interior surfaces facing the inner splash pond implements a special water feature that acts like a cooling agent, filtering and cooling down wind that's blown through. The design provides cooling for both parts of the building, the interior and the exterior. The roof has a rain water collection system that stores storm water and recycles it for the pavilion's water feature. Pressurized tiles are also installed under the splash pond and the exercising area to generate electricity to keep the water feature and splash pond operating.

Being an experiential pavilion, the centre consists of several programs that provide exercising, gathering and resting areas for the neighborhood. Tall trees are planted all around the splash pond, providing the children with a close to nature environment, while acting like a barrier to prevent children from accessing the busy streets nearby, ensuring their safety. On the other hand, the interior spaces provide the neighborhood a cool and bright exercising centre. This experiential cooling pavilion encourages the community to stay active even on a hot summer day, promoting a healthy lifestyle in the city.

The temperature in Toronto during summer continues to rise, because of varying factors such as the urban heat island effect. This is concerning for city residents, specifically those who live in buildings lacking air conditioning. The goal of this project is to create a communal cooling centre primarily for the residents of a nearby apartment building, with a focus on the elderly. Situated on a grassy field, and on the northwestern corner of a high-traffic intersection, the centre will provide an important place of refuge in heat waves and provide a lively summer recreation space. The design features four spaces, each with their own purpose, unified by an overhead lattice structure which branches off from the central space to connect the other spaces.

In the centre of the site, there is a decked seating area with patio tables and chairs, over a narrow extension of the adjacent wading pool. Three neighbouring trees shade the area, and it is completely covered by a curved, lattice structure which houses a misting system. An amenities cabin housing washrooms, a kitchenette, and storage is connected to the seating area. There is a wading pool adjacent to the central seating area that is partially covered by an extension of the lattice structure. It doubles as a skating rink, providing the space with a year-round purpose. The wading pool branches off into a narrow stream that flows under the central seating area, to extend the effect of flowing water. The pool accommodates the children's needs, providing them with a playful area. Beside the apartment building, there is another seating area, intended for elderly people. It is a quiet, isolated space separate from the pool and seating area, where residents can enjoy games or reading. This space, as well as the path which connects it to the central seating area, is decked and covered by the same extension of the lattice structure, which houses the misting system. This area accommodates elderly people, as they typically desire quiet spaces.

Kewl Pods are adaptable, modular spaces offering cooling resting spots with various programming applicable to all age groups. Kewl Pods stem from a unifying sloped pathway throughout the site offering accessible landscaped park space for residents and locals alike. Originating from the passive cooling strategy of the inhabitation of below grade spaces, Kewl Pods create comfortable gathering spaces one metre below grade connected via a ramped path running through the site. The pods further emphasize the cooling effects of being below grade through the stone flooring. Cooling is enhanced through the thermal mass of the concrete pods, absorbing cool temperatures in the night and maintaining the cool temperature during the day. The application of green roofs and urban agriculture greatly reduce the solar absorption of the concrete, allowing the pods to maintain cool temperatures within the underground spaces. The roof green spaces offer community building and engagement for adults, elderly, and parents raising young children nearby. Additional cooling is brought to the spaces through the use of fans pumping air through underground pipes into the pods. The air-filled pipes are cooled by the surrounding earth and thus pumping cooled fresh air into the Kewl Pod Stations as the hot air rises out of the pods. Throughout the site pathways, vertical agricultural cooling stations offer cool seating for elderly and adults looking for a private seating area. The vertical trellis systems hold growing medium between wire fencing providing additional planting areas absorbing solar radiation thus creating a cooled seating area. By attaching a misting system to the vertical trellis, the plants remain hydrated, resulting in less maintenance as well as offering further cooling to those sitting at the trellis cooling stations. The undulating pathway throughout the site offers cooling rest stops for adults and elderly alike, while providing roof-top viewing, play and gathering spaces for parents and children.

The Passively Aggressive cooling centre is located within a diverse urban community, encompassed by a high-rise building, parkette, and green spaces. The purpose of the Passively Aggressive centre is to provide a space primarily for the elderly, with additional consideration for the adults and children of the community to engage in community strengthening activities within a passively cooled space during extreme heat conditions. Some of the amenities that the Passively Aggressive centre provides are low impact gardening areas, study spaces with seating arrangements, projection area, unisex washrooms, all within a configuration which allows the patrons to develop their own programming as well.

The form of the Passively Aggressive centre is designed with an angled roof to provide ample shading and maximize cooling air currents. The south facade is built as a solar wall, which acts as a catalyst for the convective flow of air from between the underside of the floor and the cool pond beneath, up through the wall cavity. This current is allowed to seep up into the pavilion through small designed gaps in the floor structure to cool the space. The façade also functions as an outdoor projection area where the community can gather for interactive visual events. The Passively Aggressive centre is designed to be fully accessible and engaging for its users at all times of day. This achieved through tying in security surveillance to the existing building's system and providing solar powered path and wall lighting. The Passive Aggressive centre is a full range community space designed to engage its visitors as individuals and groups season after season.

Heat! Cooling spaces for high-rise places

As part of the 2017 Collaborative Exercise, George Kapelos teamed up with documentary filmmaker Peter Conrad to produce a documentary on the impact of heat on Torontonians living in high-rise apartment buildings. In this section, we present a full transcript of the film. Members of the public participated in the making of this film. Their images have been blurred to protect their identity. Christopher Marleau was Research Assistant in the preparation of the film. Gerda Cammaer, Documentary Media Centre and Associate Professor at School of Image Arts, facilitated the creation of this film.

So, they're moving it from the inside to the outside, making it hotter outside, with motors that run that generate heat of their own, so it all just becomes sort of a feedback loop. The more air conditioning we use, the hotter it gets, meaning the more air conditioning we need, meaning the more carbon we generate. [Shot of heat vents flapping behind steel grate]

[Female resident 3] : That's what I don't like about this building, is all the windows facing just one side, so doesn't matter what you open, it's never like air is circulating, so you need to open door in the lobby, like a hallway, so that's how it goes.  Sound of cars and traffic [Shot of dark red brick high-rise apartment with windows] [Brownstone] : If you're in a southern exposure, you're up above the tree line, then you're getting the full glory of the sun blazing through and creating a lot of heat in the unit. In a house, you can open up the windows in the front of the house, windows at the back of the house and get a breeze through. In the vast majority of apartments, you've got a window at the front and that's it. So, even though there might be air moving in, it's not really circulating in the way that would cause a breeze.

Its... let's make a comfortable space. [Right to left panning shot of playground to benches under pergola in courtyard of apartment building complex] [Male resident 1] : It does, at the end of the day, drain you and make you more tired. It can get sticky, you know, everyone's like, everyone wants to be in their own secluded space, they don't wanna out bunched up together, so... we have to find any way possible to keep cool.  Sound of cars and traffic [Shot of teenager (Male Resident 1) with apartments in background] [Narrator] : During periods of extreme heat, keeping residents of high rise buildings comfortable becomes a public health issue. Toronto public health has been exploring ways to deal with this problem. [Shot of silhouette of light and dark brown high-rise building with sun glaring and blue cloudy sky]

[Sarah Gingrich, Health Policy Specialist, Toronto Public Health] : Toronto Public Health's goal, in our work on heat in apartments is to protect the health of vulnerable people from health impacts that could happen due to extreme heat. Our secondary goal in this work is to make sure we can find solutions that minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Over 35 000 people died in the hottest summer on record. [Shot Sarah Gingrich] latitude regions. So, if you think about, uh, Toronto, we have warming from climate change, and now superimposed on that warming is the warming from heat island effect.  [Shot of heat island effect description over blurred heat map]

[Gingrich] : So, Toronto Public Health and, uh, a wide variety of other organizations want to prevent that sort of thing from happening in Toronto. [Zoom out shot of Toronto's Future Weather predictions of daily temperature maximum, number of hot days, number of extended heat waves, and daily rainfall maximums]

[On screen text] : Heat island effect - an urban area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities [Perks] : We built the city for a climate that will no longer exist, and we are going to be facing temperatures which will cause tens of thousands of people to die in the coming decades, which will cause flash floods like the one we experienced recently, and overwhelming our infrastructure. [Shot of Gord Perks with Toronto city skyline in the background]

[Shot of Tanzina Mohsin] [Shot of cars in flooded underpass and flooded subway station]

[Narrator] : Toronto is expecting a five-fold increase in heat waves by 2050. Preventing deaths caused by extreme heat will become an even greater challenge in the coming years. [Tanzina Mohsin, Lecturer Environmental Science, University of Toronto] : We will see more warming in the mid to high latitude regions of the world, and not only situated in the mid

[Mohsin] : So far, we have seen at least thirty days that were thirty degrees centigrade for this summer. 2005, we have only one days ever thirty degrees centigrade which was basically the hottest summer for the last fifteen years or so, right? So, yes, it is a concern when we have a temperature more than thirty degrees centigrade, we see more heat alerts and we see that vulnerable population are suffering.  [Shot of dead grass and bushes]

[On-screen text] : Vulnerable Populations ­ Young children ­ People with pre-existing conditions ­ Socially isolated individuals [Gingrich] : Another vulnerable group is, people who are socially isolated. So, for example, there might be a senior who isn't particularly mobile. They may have a very small social network and not have people coming to check on them when there's extreme heat. They may also have pre-existing illness or medications that make them particularly susceptible to health impacts. [Shot of Gingrich]

[Shot of Brownstone]

[Perks] : Another series of projects we've looked at is to do a social survey to find out what the vulnerable population is. Are there people with heart conditions and live in bad circumstances? What resources can we provide in our community centres and libraries, so that someone goes and identifies those people, finds them during a heat alert and makes sure that they're getting cooled off.  [Shot of busy street with traffic, construction pylons on sidewalk in foreground]

[Shot of Brownstone]

[Shot of Perks] [Brownstone] : In our communities, there's a variety of cultures, and... and so, uh, if there are any types of issues related to those cultures that, that could be taken into

[Shot of brown high-rise apartment building with tree in foreground]

[Male resident 1] : Anything you can, really. Fans... multiple fans. Air conditioning... we don't really use that anymore because it takes a lot of energy, and the kids always open up the doors and stuff, so they let out all the air conditioning, so cut that out, save the costs, you know? Ambient music  Sound of traffic and cars [Shot of Female Resident 1]

[Shot of sunlight filtering through tree branches]

[Female Resident 1] : People just combat it by, uh, drinking lots of water, spending time out of the sun in the shade. [Right to left panning shot of tree, blue sky, to long narrow gray high-rise apartment]

 Ambient music [On-screen Section text] : Heat! ­ coping strategies [Narrator] : So, what do people do now to cope with extreme heat? [Shot of silhouette of building with sun glaring through clouds]

[Female Resident 4] : I stay indoors, try to keep cool, with the fan, and drink a lot of water.  [Shot of Female Resident 2] [Shot of Male Resident 1]

97

[Female Resident 2] : I try to stay at home, to be honest. If not, I usually go either, like, to the park where there's a pool or even by the lake front where there's a little bit more of, like, a breeze. [Shot of woman (Female Resident 4)]

[Top to bottom panning shot of dark brown brick high-rise apartment with windows]

 Sound of cicadas [Female Resident 4] : The breeze is the best, and being in the shade, too, helps a lot.  Sound of traffic and cars [Shot of woman (Female Resident 5)] [Female Resident 1] : We usually congregate on the outside in the front of the building. There's various areas surrounding the building where it provides a bit of a breeze or wind tunnel cooling effect where we have a major air flow. I have two fans, I don't have an air conditioner right now, but they suffice. At this time of it when it's extremely hot, I find that they suffice. [Shot of Female Resident 1]

[Female Resident 5] : I don't, I don't like sit down and inside, you know. Mostly, we like to go out.  Sound of traffic and cars [Shot of trees in front of high-rise building with cars parked in lot]

[Brownstone] : For instance, to bring the temperature to within a reasonable level, it's not exactly cool, and then to have a fan on your body, that combination is really kind of the sweet spot, I think, both in terms of cost because mechanical systems are very expensive, but also in terms of minimizing the increase in energy consumption while giving a cooling solution. So that's, I think, the real score for passive. [Shot of balconies of apartment building with dead tree branches in foreground]

[Shot of dark red brick apartment building with trees in foreground] [Narrator] : Toronto Public Health has studies the impact of heat in highrise apartment buildings, and has reported on a range of possible solutions.  [Bottom to top panning shot of parking lot to high-rise apartment building] [Bottom to top panning shot of dead grass and bushes to side of light gray and brown high-rise apartment]

[Shot of Brownstone]

[Gingrich] : One of the reports that we commissioned looks at some of the energy efficient or passive ways that you can cool an apartment. That's beneficial because we can help solve the problem without exacerbating climate change.  [Shot of concrete planters in front of small apartment building]

99
high-rise apartment building]

 [Shot of balconies on high-rise apartment with cloudy blue sky in background] [Gingrich] : One of the strategies that we're looking at is the idea of making sure that residents have access to a cool place where they can go if their apartment is too hot.  Ambient music [Shot of Male Resident 2]

 [Shot of Gingrich]

[Male resident 2] : I would love to see one of those around here. That would be amazing. [Shot of Gingrich]  [Shot of pathway adjacent to small apartment complex with trees]

[Gingrich] : So, these shared cool spaces could be a shared cool room with air conditioning in the building. You could also have an outdoor cooled place, somewhere with shade, near the building where tenants could go to, to get relief from their overheated apartment. [Narrator] : Toronto Public Health is currently working with tenants and landlords to develop on-site cooling strategies for high-rise apartment dwellers.

[Shot of wood and concrete bench next to a fence with parking lot in background]

[Shot of high-rise apartment with tree in foreground]

[Brownstone] : People do want to still feel comfortable in their homes, and there's lots of reasons for seniors or people with disabilities who don't have the opportunity to move as freely from inside to outside and escape the heat within their home. So, you really need look at opportunities in both places.  [Shot of Brownstone]

[Narrator] : There are many design considerations in creating purpose built cooling centres. Whether the cooling space is within a building or outside may depend on the needs of users.  [Shot of stairs to entrance of building with people standing in shade]

 [Shot of high-rise apartment through tree branches]

[Left to right panning shot of paved area next to building with shaded area to parking lot in front of apartment complex]

[Gingrich] : An example of a another group that may want to use the shared cool space outdoors I a family with young kids. So, they would be looking for very different features. Young kids need somewhere they can play, so that they want to go to the cool space and they can make use of it and feel comfortable staying there. 

101
[shot of people sitting outside in shaded area] [Brownstone] : With outdoor cooling spaces, the proof is in the pudding. On any day like today, you go to a park and you see kids and their parents in the splash pool. You see people, you know, eating their lunches under trees for shade purposes. So, I do think that passive outdoor cooling has proven itself over the years. You know, to me, as natural as possible is really important. That there are features there that make people feel comfortable, so the type of seating that's there, the amount of shade that's there, the type of shade that's there, the water feature if it's not one that uses too much energy would be great. Plastics, for the most part... probably not a good idea anymore. And, you know, it's a shame because we used to build all our playgrounds out of wood, now we build them out of plastic, which may be something that, you know, kids aren't going to want to play on really hot days, because its uncomfortable. So, I think taking those types of aspects into account when looking at the design process are really the key.  [Shot of Brownstone]

[Shot of women sitting in parking lot under shade with baby stroller]

[Female Resident 3] : From my position, I'm a mom, so like, if I was going outside it's so it's nice to stay in the shadows.  [Shot of Female Resident 3] [Shot of parkette with trees and benches in apartment complex]

 Ambient music [Bottom to top panning shot of sidewalk to side of light gray apartment building]

 [Shot of watering pole cooling area with red brick apartment] [Narrator] : How receptive would apartment residents be to an outdoor cooling centre located on the grounds of their building? Would they use it?  [Shot of Male Resident 4]

 [Shot of playground with dead grass in foreground] [Male Resident 4] : Oh, I definitely would. I definitely would if the unit got too hot. Definitely. [Shot of Male Resident 2]  [Shot of playground with children playing, with apartment in background]

103
[Male Resident 2] : If we had one around, I think most of the people would just be there, to be honest, because no one wants to be really home because everyone wants to be outside, but at the same time it's too hot to be outside, so I'd rather be, like, somewhere where it's cool and outside at the same time.  Ambient music [Shot of Male Resident 1]  [Shot of chess benches in shade with highrise apartment in background]

[Male Resident 1] : Yeah, why not? I'd check it out, see what it's about, you know? And if it's something that benefits me, why not, you know? You even spread the word... you, you brejins, there's a cooling spot over here, come tru. You know, everyone comes through, chill out... yeah, it could be a nice, nice time, you know. Heat! ­ the way forward  Ambient music [Shot of sunlight filtering through branches]

 [Shot of dead field of grass with street and apartment in background]

[Alter] : I think that the less has to be in the building and the more has to be outside. [Shot of Alter] [On-screen Section text] : Heat! ­ the way forward [Brownstone] : You know, the future, uh, with climate change is not something we're going to avoid. You may be able to, you know, mitigate it somewhat, but it's here. So you really need to think about what you're using in an outdoor space if you're going to make people comfortable.  [Shot of Brownstone]  [Right to left panning shot of light brown apartment through tree branches]

104
[Perks] : The thing that I think that's most important for students to bear in mind is that the previous two generations got it terribly, horribly wrong. You're going to have to think outside of traditional practice, and take a much more multidisciplinary approach, and recognize that the climate you're planning for isn't the climate we currently live in.   Ambient music [Brownstone] : Look at those technologies that aren't new and slick, but that have been proven for a long time in other parts of the world, because those temperature and those types of weather systems are what's coming our way. So, rather than trying to, you know, be overly technical, let's look at solutions that have worked for hundreds of years in other places and let's start using those.  [Shot of Brownstone] [Shot of Perks] [Shot of city with buildings in foreground, midground, and background, and dark cloudy sky]



 [Shot of window mounted air conditioning unit with tree branches in foreground]  Ambient music [Narrator] : Outdoor cooling spaces are an important part of the solution to dealing with periods of extreme heat. As architects, we have an opportunity to use our creative powers to address the problem of extreme heat. In this way, we can help Toronto deal more effectively with climate change.
