DESIGNING FOR COMPLEXITY A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN HIGH DENSITY HOUSING

Master of Architecture 2016 Shiloh Lazar Master of Architecture Ryerson University ABSTRACT The func onalism and reduc vism behind post war modernist high-rise housing typologies like the slab block, failed to understand the impact of this highly condensed circula on on the social interac ons of residents. Contemporary high-rise architecture typologies like the point tower s ll don't account for the complex social needs of inhabitants - providing isolated group ac vity spaces in lieu of addressing and elabora ng the shape and form of the transi onal spaces between the street and the unit door. This thesis asserts that understanding the complexity of social needs and norma ve social behavioral pa erns will inform an approach to design that will allow for a more humane and socially interac ve environment. This thesis design explores Systems Theory, Pa ern Language, recent precedents and tac cs like clustering, layered gradients of privacy, visual buffering, transparency, texture and materiality in a high-density residen al design for Toronto's rapidly intensifying core

INTRODUCTION
Humans have shaped their understanding of the world from the beginning of the modern period through the lens of deduc ve analysis. Through deduc ve logic, all phenomena are broken down into their smallest cons tuent parts, analyzed and reconstructed to help build an understanding of how they exist and work. While this process is necessary for learning, it does require substan ve control over circumstan al variables that relate to various phenomena. This level of control, in prac ce, is by and large only possible in a theore cal environment. Thus, a high prevalence of discrepancies exists between real-world reali es and their theore cal existences. Differences stem from the fact that the real world is much more complex than the theore cal, where context provides an array of variables that significantly affect the outcome of any theore cal solu on. From realiza on of this issue has emerged need for a more cri cal approach to scien fic inves ga on of ma er, one that is more sensi ve to the complex nature of reality. The Systems Theory paradigm shi seeks to bridge the divide between theore cal knowledge and the complexity of reality that a deduc ve method alone is incapable of reconciling. In reality human ac ons are mo vated by a complex set of needs, which cannot easily be interpreted. All needs exist in a systemic rela onship, which one's ac ons aim to address. The way in which humans interact with the built environment is, as with other ac ons, the result of the human mo va on to address certain needs. Needs may be directly addressed in the built environment, as in the cases of shelter and of warmth. Needs may also be addressed indirectly through the build environment when built space acts as a facilitator that can help, or hinder, a need being addressed. Such is the case with social needs, where space is not a determinis c variable governing social outcome. In order for people to process informa on, it is necessary to deduc vely break down larger problems into smaller ones. In many cases, deduc ve analysis requires a level of scru ny that necessitates contextual variants to be isolated for the sake of understanding a specific problem. Complica ons arise when these problems are engaged only at this isolated level of detail, where one must forgo context for the sake of understanding. This is also true of architectural design's engagement with human needs. The act of designing, like any other ac on, is one where the intent is to satisfy a specific need. However, a design solu on that results when one has deduced a collec on of problems from a set of needs can become a simplified checklist of requirements to be sa sfied. The concern is that more o en than not, design problems remain in isola on from one another, and are addressed as such, when in

reality they are a set of human needs that exist in a systemic rela onship. Put simply, the process of deduc vely addressing human needs conflicts with the complex nature of human needs. By engaging a set of problems without understanding the nature of their rela onship, poten al for mul ple conflicts to occur within these solu ons arises. While iden fying needs is important, it is equally important to know how different needs are related, and are affected by others. Such knowledge can ensure that a soluon that sa sfies one need does not complicate or hinder sa sfac on of another, and result in more harm than good. This thesis asserts that an understanding of the interrelated nature of human needs is cri cal if design explora ons are to address successfully problems of design and sa sfy human needs holis cally. This systemic approach to addressing human needs results in a different func onal defini on of the design problem one that is more a uned to human needs, and can more accurately reflect the interrelated nature of needs, resul ng in an environment that is more sensi ve to the human condi on. The design of many high-rise urban apartments illustrates this hypothesis well. While the importance of social integra on is well known, the overall design of such structures generally does not foster social interac on within the building perimeter, par cularly within the core of downtown Toronto. This situa on can be attributed to a conflict of social needs and privacy needs. The thesis design component will inves gate the nature of this rela onship and develop a solu on for how these needs can best be nego ated systemically in built form.

1| COMPLEXITY IN ARCHITECTURE

THE EVOLUTION OF INHUMAN ARCHITECTURE
As Gordon Pask has stated, "The func ons, a er all, are performed for human beings or human socie es. It follows that a building cannot be viewed simply in isola on, it is only meaningful as a human environment. It perpetually interacts with its inhabitants, on the one hand serving them and on the other hand controlling their behavior," (Pask, 1969, p. 494). Pask's interpreta on of func onalism acknowledges the fact that while architecture facilitates specific ac vi es, it is impera ve that it remains sensi ve to human beings and to their complex network of needs. In contrast to Pask's cyberne c perspec ve, the idea of func onalism was be er understood in a u litarian and mechanical light in the early 20th century, and formed the basis of what became `Interna onal Modern Architecture' (Roth, 2007, p. 12). By adap ng the scien fic models of objec ve and ra onal logic to the design process, the complexity of life was reduced to a mere func onal rubric governed by minimum standards and measurable quan es (Gleiniger & Vrachlio s, 2008, p. 45-46). The result, as Bachman points out is, "...that architectural design has heretofore generally treated the deeply interrelated and dynamic characteriscs of buildings as if they could be reduced to mechanis c problems that are readily amenable to physical manipula on as formal objects," (Bachman, 2012, p. 64). Modern Architecture has simplified the variables of the human condi on, the programma c func on, and the context, as a means of crea ng a logical efficiency, which has resulted in a form that is focused on the func onal efficiency of ac vi es that it is intended to facilitate (Norberg-Schulz, 1968, p. 21). As Pérez Gómez notes, "Correla vely, prac ce has been transformed into a process of produc on without existen al meaning, clearly defined aims, or reference to human values," (Pérez Gómez, 1983, p. 8). The rela onship between who uses space ­ that is, their existen al needs ­ and the intended use ­ that is, the func onal requirements that a space is designed to facilitate ­ is fundamentally what allows architecture to remain sensi ve to human nature. One of the most prominent arguments against modernism was the priori za on of func on and oversimplifica on of human need. However, while the variables with which design is explored have increased, in an a empt to increase sensi vity to the human condi on, the design approach is fundamentally the same (see Fig 1.1).

However as illustrated the approach was based on a reductive understanding of these individual areas which does not address the complex relationships among the various study areas.

work by which architectural theory and prac ce a empts to create architectural form, has proven insufficient in understanding and mee ng the needs of the human condi on (Pérez Gómez, 1983, pp. 7-8). While is important to understand individual aspects of human need, it is also important to understand how they are designed to be addressed, and to understand the dynamic rela onship of variables that comprise the complex system of human needs (see Fig 1.2). As with all other natural systems, these individual needs must be understood as an interrelated system that func ons as a whole, and not as discrete parts (Pask, 1969, p. 494).

The detail complexity is the type of complexity, a reductive complexity, that is most prevalent in typical design complexity. He compares the two types to a forest and a tree farm to distinguish between the nature of their complexity.

ADDRESSING COMPLEXITY IN ARCHITECTURE
There is no single theory that can decipher the human condi on into a set of rules, that can be adopted by a medium. Generally, phenomena are simplified in order to understand them to and use the simplified variables as a framework for design ­ a process adopted from modern science. This merely creates a collec on of variables that are difficult to group together in order to form a whole en ty. It is a piecemeal way of thinking, one with unexpected and disastrous results (Flood & Carson, 1993). The difference between the sum of individual variables, and a synergis c whole en ty understanding the complexity of the rela onships between the parts. Although complex systems are difficult to understand, "design must embrace the unity and harmony that emerges when parts are combined in beneficial synergy," (Bachman, 2012, p. 14) in order to create environments that address the human condi on holis cally. For this reason, cau on should be taken when engaging the need for complexity from a singular perspec ve in par cular formal complexity. If perceived visual complexity is the only means of achieving complexity within the built environment, it can become another calculable simplis c strategy for design, another determinis c variable. This can be considered complexity for the sake of complexity as opposed to complexity that seeks to address holis cally the human condi on. What results is an ar ficial complexity, which instead of addressing the need for complexity, displaces it with formal complexity (Gleiniger & Vrachlio s, 2008, p. 55). Nikos Salingaros states that very few contemporary design approaches respond to both physical human use and human sensibili es, as they fail to address what makes humans feel psychologically comfortable, and insufficiently create environments that are conducive to carrying out their intended func ons (Salingaros N. A., 2006, p. 222). This can be interpreted as the result of reducing complexity to a singular level of applica on when, to quote Venturi, "A valid architecture evokes many levels of meaning and combina ons of focus: its space and its elements become readable and workable in several ways at once," (Venturi, 1977, p. 16). In contemporary prac ce, the issue has become less of an argument for complexity in the built environment, and has instead become one that places emphasis on a be er understanding of how complexity can be applied, and why. Salingaros iden fies the approach that contemporary prac ce has adopted, in search for a new paradigm in architectural form, as one that irra onally applies complexity to form (Salingaros N. A., 2007, p. 132). Whether it be through the use of computa onal technology or the applica on of natural ordering systems, if architectural form is to be

sensi ve to the human condi on, then the considera on given to the logic of the system should be comparable to its applicaon and use. An architectural complexity that is intended to address human needs and human nature, is unequipped to do so if it is limited to a simplified visual complexity. Farshid Moussavi and Daniel López, elaborate further on a broader understanding of complexity in architectural form as defining human environments. Examining the needs of society, there is such an inherent diversity that if the built environment is to address the human condi on, it must address the complexity of its needs. "As a funcon rather than an instrument of contemporary culture, architectural forms need to vary in order to address its plurality and mutability," (Moussavi, F., & López, D., 2009, p. 9). Complexity as it relates to the human condi on and to architectural form cannot be oversimplified if the result is to be a well-designed environment. An issue with architectural design is that, "instead of recognizing complexi es, design inves ga on is generally rendered as norma ve problems," (Bachman, 2012, p. 62). Leonard Bachman has categorized complexity into four main groups of architectural complexity theories (see Fig 1.3). While

these models look at complexity in varied and dis nct ways, all suggest that in one way or another, within architectural praxis, there is a need for a more thorough understanding of complexity as it relates to humans' response to their environment. An issue that is consistent throughout all of the four groups is that, in order for architectural form to be humanis c, complexity should be addressed holis cally as a system, with an understanding both of the elements, and of the rela onships between them.

COMPLEXITY AND SYSTEMS THINKING
To understand the nature of a phenomena, it is necessary to analyse deduc vely, its cons tuent parts. However, the parts do not exist, nor do they func on in isola on, which necessitates an understanding of how the parts func on in context. This is the essence of the evolu onary logic leading from reduc onism to systems thinking: understanding how phenomena are affected, and exist, in the reality of their actual context, and understanding how they fit into, and are connected and balanced, within a larger system. Herein lies the paradigm shi , from a reduc ve or analy cal determinis c thinking, that has redefined the modern world as a more complex world view, based on synthesis. Complexity theory and systems theory may be acknowledged as more accurate representa ons of the interrelatedness which connect people, objects and ideas in the world. The modern world has been understood based on a linear epistemology of reality, where cause and effect have a clear and determined rela onship. Based on this understanding, phenomena and processes can be determined by understanding and deducing causal rela onships among the most basic elements of a system. In the case of larger systems, this deduc ve logic describes the total system by breaking down its cons tuent parts and recombining them. Essen ally, this means that it is the sum of the individual components that will result in the whole system. However, while this form of reasoning has proven effec ve when there are low levels of interconnec vity within a system, it becomes extremely limited and inaccurate with highly interconnected and complex systems. Systems theory and complexity theory understand that the rela onship between elements in an organized interrelated group, a system, exist and relate to each other in a way that produces something that is greater than the sum of the individual cons tuent parts. Therefore, they cannot be understood through deduc ve analysis of the parts alone, but rather have to be understood in the context of the nature of the rela onships of the parts, and how they contribute to the system holis cally (Flood & Carson, 1993, p. 14).

In the realm of architectural discourse, complexity and systems theory have been dealt with in several ways, ranging from sustainability, to computa onal form finding, to the applica on of social sciences in design. From an experien al perspec ve, cri cal discussion of complexity in architecture began to emerge as a result of the extreme banality of modernism. The oversimplifica on of architectural solu ons presented by modernism, results from the ra onalist view of buildings as machines for living, and whose form was solely the product of the func on, led to architects forge ng that buildings were meant to be used by people (Lang & Moleski, 2010, pp. 10-12). Human experience was omi ed from the func onalist program and resulted in buildings to which humans could not relate. Compounded by this need for programma c efficiency, it was the aim of architects to have func onalist ideals of architecture and urban form emanate and be expressed in society through manifesta on of a ra onal urban form. Subsequent recoil from thinkers such as Jane Jacobs on urbanism and Robert Venturi on architectural form a ested to the significance of a humanis c experience and the ability for humans to relate to their environment, which was to promote complexity of experience. It can be argued that one of the fundamental issues being addressed was a lack of sensi vity to human needs. While funconal spaces were being designed to adhere to the func onal requirements of a program, the designers were overlooking how human needs func on in a complex system to include elements such as social dynamics, which would in turn change how spa al rela onships would then be organized and further ar culated. If architecture were intended to create space that is appropriate to human func ons and sensi ve to their needs, then spaces would best be designed systemically to respond to how human needs relate as a system. Further, as a basis for func onality, a thorough understanding of how human theories of needs work as a system, would be essen al to crea ng environments that are not just suitable for human habita on, but that are also conducive to a posi ve experience of that space.

OVERSIMPLIFICATION, FUNCTIONALISM AND REDUCTIVISM
One of the most iconic images marking the decline of modern architecture was the demoli on of Prui -Igoe in 1972 (Roth, 2007, p. 560). While its demise was the result of ming and economics, much can be said and has been said, about the func onalist principles that were manifested in its design. In Crea ng Defensible Space, Oscar Newman highlights a clear dis nc on between the care received by small-scale shared and personal spaces, in contrast to the abuse directed at large-scale communal spaces, which offered no sense of iden ty to individuals or to the human

collec ve (Newman, 1996, p. 10, 11). It can be said that func onal efficiency of the design, which resulted in compartmentalizaon of space, ranging from exterior spaces, circula on, communal spaces, and shared u lity spaces, to individual units, was not sensi ve to the complex nature of the social dynamics between public and private spaces within the project. Modern design principles were based on mechanical and u litarian efficiency, largely in opposi on to most human ac vi es, which cannot be reduced to a simplified formula and applied universally to all building programs (Roth, 2007, p. 12). These efficiency-driven principles are not necessarily congruent with how the experien al nature of spaces exists symbio cally as a whole en ty. One's percep on of the environment, and ul mately the experience of an individual space, is not shaped independently by an individual space, but rather collec vely, by the spa al rela onships that are shared within the space and its context. This is one of the core ideas of space as presented by Bill Hillier when he states that, "Very few of the purposes for which we build buildings and environments are not `people configura ons' in this sense. We should therefore in principle expect that the rela on between people and space, if there is one, will be found at the level of the configura on of space rather than the individual space," (Hillier, 1996, pp. 29-31). While the significance of spa al configura on is evident in places that share direct rela onships, whether through physical or visual proximity, it is also true where physical rela onships are not immediately obvious, but are accumulated in the experien al narra ve of a place. Sussman and Hollander consider the narrave that we generate by progressing through a space essen al to the experien al quality that makes spaces great. It is this embedded narra ve which makes the difference between a space where people want to be, take pride in and call their own, and a place which is lacklustre and le abandoned. "It [narra ve] suggests one more way people consistently look for orienta on and connec ons to their environment [...] Every plan and urban design has the poten al to acknowledge and respond to this trait in some way or another, or as is frequently the case in built environments today, ignore it. One could make the argument that it is the inherent lack of a narra ve quality in many of the post-war American suburbs, that gives these areas their feelings of placelessness and anomie," (Sussman & Hollander, 2015, p. 134).

Due to this interrelated nature of spa al experience, it is impossible to design a space successfully without considering how the space acts as an element, within a larger spa al system, that contributes in various capaci es to the overall experience of the place within its immediate and wider context. The nature of any individual space is such that it is perceived as one part within a whole system of spaces, and is not experienced independently. To design a space in a way that is sensi ve to how humans perceive and experience space, the design process should be approached in a way that responds to the complex nature of spa al percep on, and which is engaged as a systemic whole, as opposed to a collec on of parts. As in the example of Prui -Igoe, this systemic approach may have resulted in greater sensi vity to arrangement and scale at both the individual and the collec ve spa al level than did the ra onalis c, programmatic compartmentaliza on of spaces. The oversimplifica on of human needs results in the oversimplifica on of the built form, which in turn results in spaces that do not respond to the complexity of human need. Inasmuch as it is necessary to simplify a problem to be er understand it, a design solu on must be understood within the context of the system of needs it is intended to address. Individualis c schemes are not viable for long-term use, since they will con nually require ad hoc retrofits to remedy the problems that are caused by fric on among collec ons of individualis c solu ons. This interpreta on brings to light the advantage of systemic solu ons that understand how human needs work in concert, to define the big picture problem holis cally.

2| SYSTEMS & DESIGN HOLISM

ARCHITECTURE AS A HUMAN PRODUCT
There exists a contradic on in the nature of human beings and that of the natural world. Human beings exist as a part of nature but unlike other organisms, we act outside the equilibrium of nature's laws. This presents a paradox, in that human nature, the innate behavioral pa erns of human beings, is in part mutualis c with the natural world while also being at odds with it. The dichotomy manifests in the way that human society exists in the natural world. We humans are part of the natural world, and the way in which we adapt to it should acknowledge that. "In general we may say that architecture is a human product which should order and improve our rela ons with the environment," (Norberg-Schulz, 1968, p. 22). In contrast there exists also our other, innate desire, which compels us to understand the eternal. This demands more of our environment than nature can offer and ul mately defines architecture as, "...what nature cannot make," (Kahn, 1965, p. 305). In this respect, architecture can be defined as the medium which shapes our environments to meet the needs of the human condi on. It balances the aspects that define us as natural beings, and the func ons that define our intellectual consciousness. Chris an Norberg-Schulz highlights the fact that, "Architecture is a human product that mediates the rela onship between man and the environment which in turn influences us and determines our mood" (Norberg-Schulz, p. 22). Both Norberg-Schulz and Robert Venturi acknowledge a lack in complexity of architectural form as a major contributor to architecture's incompa bility with human sensibili es. Venturi in par cular states, "Orthodox Modern architects have tended to recognize complexity insufficiently or inconsistently in their a empt to break with tradi on and start all over again. They idealized the primi ve and elementary at the expense of the diverse and the sophis cated." (Venturi, p. 16). The ironic twist of modernist func onalism is that, a building is not truly func onal if not designed in line with the needs of the people who will occupy and use the space. This necessitates an approach to the ideas of func onality from a human-centric perspec ve, as opposed to a program-centric defini ve view. "Forms, spaces, and surfaces can also nourish people psychologically by promo ng a sense of well-being...The way something is built and the way it looks (i.e., its form language) have a major impact in whether humans feel comfortable or not inside and around such a building...A building that is built in a way that its visual appearance discourages or hinders human ac vity can be said to be effec vely `dead', since no-none wants to use it," (Saling-

aros, p. 235). Complexity can be defined as, "the state of having many parts", or "the features of something that make it difficult to understand either in part, whole, or the rela onships that govern the whole." The human condi on, from any perspec ve, is layered with complexity. To appreciate the rela onship between humans and architecture, an understanding of the complexity of human needs and nature is cri cal. One of the most widely used theories that a empts to describes how human behavior and needs are associated is Maslow's Theory of Human Mo va on. This theory seeks to categorize the various psychological and physiological mo vators for human ac ons and reac ons. His theory offers at a basic level, a list of condi ons and prerequisites that are essen al for the holis c well-being and happiness of an individual. What is important to understand is that, while human ac vity is mo vated by the desire to sa sfy needs and as a human ac vity, the design and construc on of an architectural ar fact is mo vated by a complex of different needs. In most cases, architectural form is a construct designed to facilitate human ac vity and so, theore cally, its complexity is inherent. It should also be noted that there are many different types of complexi es that are embodied in a work of architecture, from the contextual and technical components of construc on variables, to the func onal aspects of the building program. While all aspects must be synthesized for the building to materialize, some aspects are more important than others in determining how space is to be experienced.

EXPERIENCING SPACES AS A WHOLE
All needs are addressed through the environment whether physically, psychologically, socially, or otherwise. The human rela onship to the environment is complex, and needs are addressed systemically where various factors work collec vely for an outcome. The environment affects individual human experience and is part of an equa on resul ng in our behavior, which consequen ally affects our social behavior and experience. It is a cyclical process, in which one influences the other and cannot be understood without the other. Different variables, such as comfort, light or sensorial quali es, while separate from each other, all contribute to the overall spa al atmosphere. This in turn influences our behavior, based on our experience of a place, from which we form memories and associa ons. Everything up to the present plays a part in what becomes a history of experiences that will ul mately inform future experience. Simply stated, new situa ons are experienced in rela on to those of the past. Similarly, in a building, individual or autonomous spaces all contribute to our experience

of other spaces, which are perceived or understood in the context of the building as a larger, autonomous system. We inhabit a space, and our experience of that space is the result of both the individual collec on of quali es that exist in its immediate environment (e.g. the people, the climate, the objects etc.), as well as those in its wider context, namely other adjacent spaces. A result of this rela vity of spa al experiences is that, if one compares a similar pair of spaces in two separate buildings, there is greater poten al to favour one space over the other, based not on the space independently, but rather based on associa ng it with other spaces within its respec ve building. We perceive and associate quality of the whole and the parts, not one or the other. As Lang and Moleski remark, "Any theory of func on in architecture must recognize the rela vity of experience. Meanings depend on the experiences that we have in everyday life," (Lang & Moleski, 2010, p. 41). Maurice Mearleau-Ponty's understanding of phenomenology is also consistent with how humans understand the world through the framework of the self and the body, the consciousness of others as well as the effects of the environment, and how all of these perspec ves create a cumula ve understanding of the human consciousness. He addresses the experien al learning process of each case in detail in his book Phenomenology of Percep on. One's understanding of the world through phenomenology is based on experience, and we experience the world through the self and our body, through the understanding and reinforcement of ideas of others' consciousness and through percep on of natural phenomenon. We understand what something is, and understand similar ideas because we apply our ini al knowledge of the former to that of the la er. We learn and are able to understand, through our experiences. This process is applied to our sense of percep on and our understanding of the world (Merleau-Ponty & Landes, 2014, p. 413). These accumulated experiences of the self, of others and of the larger environment, can be considered from a phenomenological perspec ve, integral to human nature. It also requires human-centric design to be sensi ve to the complex nature of human percep on, if design is to produce environments to which humans can relate. Through architecture, humans create their own or adapt to the exis ng environment. If architectural design is to address the human condi on, it is important to understand its func on within the system of human needs and pa erns of human experience. Further, as a common denominator the designer can a empt to understand both the direct and indirect impact of how needs can be addressed, at both the individual and the social group level.

The role of the environment is par cularly significant within the focus of this discourse, for, as previously stated, architecture is the result of humans shaping the environment to "sa sfy" (MaxNeef, Elizald, & Hopenhayn, 1992) their needs. In reality, humans exist in space and all phenomenon are experienced in space. Therefore, while the act of building directly addresses environmental sa sfiers, such as shelter and security, the individual and the social group contexts are indirectly related to the environmental se ng, and all are interdependent components of spa al experiences. This becomes clear in examining Max-Neef's Human Development matrix, where his existen al interac ve needs are all environments, that facilitate the axiological (fundamental) needs. Understanding the role that an environment plays in all three needs contexts (environment, individual and social), and how our human nature is programmed to sa sfy needs, will begin to illuminate possibili es for the development of architectural strategies that are more sensi ve to the complexity of the human condi on. Human needs, as seen through either the theory of mo va on or development, despite their differences do acknowledge that human needs exist and that they are sa sfied in a complex interrelated system. Needs are affected and met, not in isola on, but in rela on to other needs in the whole system. Mary Joyce Hasell and Reed Benhamou have proposed a framework to engage the human-environment rela onship as a supra-system. Based on James Miller's Living Systems Theory, their theory defines human ac vity as a system, which creates ar facts. The rela onship between ac vity and ar fact is characterized as two systems of design. Based on Francis Ferguson's perspec ve of design, the ac vity system is described as an organic design approach, which is human-centric and based on sensi vity to environmental context and behavior. Alterna vely, the ar fact system is described as an inorganic design approach: a system of design focused on the manipula on of the ar fact. The difference between the two models can be illustrated by the ra onal governing of the placement of windows in a façade. In an organic model, the window would be located based on views and access to light. Here, placement enhances the experien al quali es within the space. This model is more intui ve, dynamic, adaptable and amenable to a more free-form approach to ar cula ng space. The model is exemplified in the work of architects such as Wright and Sullivan. In contrast, in an inorganic model the placement would be based on symmetry or on some other ordering system. The approach is described as ra onal and idealis c, is more sta c, and based on regularity or modularity, as is demonstrated in the ideas of architects such as Palladio and Gropius. Hasell and Benhamou's recognize the value of both organic

and inorganic systems, and argue that a holis c system approach to design would balance both systems, and can result in a design that is func onal and sensi ve to human needs. These theore cal frameworks were intended to be scalable based the extent of the environment the ar fact is designed to support, i.e. a space at the scale of the individual or group, a building at the scale of an organiza on, or an urban area at the level of the general society. In this way, the building scale can be compared to a microsystem within the macro-system of a city, in the same way that a space might relate to a building. In looking at the building as the ar fact in this context, understanding how one space relates to another becomes cri cal not only within the building, but to other spaces within the city as a larger system. Although it is important to understand how an individual space func ons, and is experienced, it is also important to consider how the same space func ons, and is experienced in rela on to the context of its broader systems, to ensure that it supports the human ac vity or needs that it is intended to sa sfy. This perspec ve brings to light the significance of spa al rela onships within a system of spaces. Within the context of a city or of a building, spaces can be organized into interrelated spaces that contribute to the overall experience of the place. In the context of this thesis, such an approach to the design of the ar fact will be explored through crea on of a system of public and private spaces to promote social interac on throughout the building and within its immediate vicinity in the city. The intent is to inves gate how public spaces in buildings can func on as a holis c system, in order to address the need for social interac on, as the primary need being addressed, by ensuring that these spaces, or ar facts, are designed to be conducive to the systemic way that social interac on is sa sfied. "Public spaces," in this case, refers to the open spaces across the site, accessible to the general public, as well as the shared or communal spaces accessible only to residents within the main part of the building. "Private spaces" here refer to individual spaces within the residen al units or work spaces in the commercial areas of the building. While it is important to have elements in a system be organized as a complementary whole, it is also cri cal to ensure that the building, or ar fact, which is effec vely a system of systems, be organized in order to create mutualis c rela onships among its cons tuent parts. Within the context of public and private spa al systems in a building, this can entail ensuring propor onal relaonships between both the quan ty of public-to-private spaces, and the experien al quality, that the spaces afford. Quality becomes important, as this determines the vibrancy and viability of

the space to be a place that people find comfortable and where they desire to be. Ul mately, if a building is viewed as a system, then all of its subsystems and elements contribute to the overall experience and func on of the place for people to occupy and live in. As an example, the func onal role of corridors, as elements of a typical modern flat slab building is to connect all units and to connect each individual in the building. They are arguably the most public areas within the building, but their physical dimensions and design do not benefit the social life of the building. If the different spaces in the public spa al system (e.g. corridors, amenity spaces, etc.), are be er integrated among each other and with the private spa al system, then the rela onship between the units will correspondingly change. This creates a different emergent spa al dynamic between what is public and what is private, which ul mately creates a greater poten al for serendipitous encounters, and can thereby increase the probability of mee ng the social needs for the residents of the building and by extension its surrounding context. From a systems perspec ve, the func onal defini ons of various spaces in the building system may create an emergent func onal defini on of the spaces. In the case of the corridor, as opposed to it being a space for people to move between specific des na ons in the building, it can become a conduit for experiencing life within the building. The corridor then becomes essen ally an internal street, suppor ng a social life within the building. A change in the func onal defini on can also change the way in which the space is designed, resul ng in a corridor that may become dras cally different in terms of experience. This idea could then further be extended to the surrounding context, to allow connec ons, whether visual and or physical, to the life of the city, thus crea ng a similar mutualis c rela onship between the life of the building and the life of the city. The systems approach discussed by Hasell and Benhamou was intended to be applicable as a prac cal and theore cal framework. In applying this framework to the thesis project, the two systems can be framed in a manner such that they are then translated into a design problem. In applying the framework, the systems will be defined as: func ons of human social needs (the ac vity system), and a design addressing of the spa al configura on which is sensi ve to the experien al func on of built space (the ar fact system).

havior are dictated by the same cogni ve processing. Human nature is defined by the common psychophysical characteris cs of human beings, which in this sense include human needs. In one way or another, humans are programed to sa sfy their needs. In order to understand how architecture can respond to human need and act as a sa sfier it must, "first look at how people are built ­ not only mechanically but also mentally, subconsciously, and then design or plan for these requirements and tendencies," (Sussman & Hollander, 2015, p. 157). What can be inferred from this is that a greater understanding of human need is insufficient, as sa sfiers can vary. What is cri cal, is to understand how humans are programmed to sa sfy their needs, and to design in coherence with their innate pa erns or human nature. In contemporary thought, we understand human needs not as determinis c, but rather as subjec ve and situa onal. Things that we acquire and use are essen ally a means to address needs. Our ac ons are fashioned to address needs, not individualis cally, or as in a series of check boxes, but systema cally. Theories of human need recognize the fluidity of discrete needs, and propose that they are addressed in most scenarios together in a system where more than one need is sa sfied. There are two main theories of human need: Abraham Maslow's theory of human mo vaon and Manfred Max-Neef's human scale development theory. One of the key differences between the two theories is the premise by which human needs are met. In Maslow's theory, the system is hierarchical where different needs groups are sa sfied in a sequence (see Fig. 2.1), while MaxNeef's theory proposes that there is no hierarchy, and that needs are sa sfied in a more integrated framework (see Fig. 2.2). MaxNeef further states that, "the sa sfiers do not operate in a linear fashion but rather in a matrix allowing mul ple rela onships between needs and sa sfiers, which are in themselves in a state of flux" (Max-Neef, Elizald, & Hopenhayn, 1992, p. 199). In a cri cism of Corbusier's applica on of Maslow's Human Needs theory, Murray et al. have noted that understanding human needs as a hierarchical system has resulted in architecture that is focused on needs that can be directly linked to the built environment, that is as a "shelter", as opposed to, "a synergic sa sfier that influences the sa sfac on of all human needs," (Murray, Pauw, & Holm, 2005, p. 6). However, Maslow's theory does acknowledge that, within the hierarchy lower needs do not have to be fully sa sfied for the upper level needs to be addressed, as this allows to some extent, the possibility of addressing needs in a nonlinear fashion. The theory states that, "no need or drive can be treated as if it were isolated or discrete; every drive is related to the state of sat-

isfac on or dissa sfac on of other drives," (Maslow, 1943, p. 1). This suggests that while two theories are dis nct there is a common understanding that wellbeing is achieved, not through focusing on specific needs independently, but by focusing on needs as a collec ve system.

Max-Neef provides a breakdown of the system of human needs that will be proposed here as part of the framework for an invesga on of how social need should be addressed rela ve to other needs. In his theory he states that needs are met in three specific contexts: (1) with regard to oneself (Eigenwelt); (2) with regard to the social group (Mitwelt); and (3) with regard to the environment (Umwelt) (Max-Neef, Elizald, & Hopenhayn, 1992, p. 200). This framework can be viewed as three categories of perceptual understandings, which are fundamental in the development of a human's phenomenological understanding of the world, and are arguably founda onal to human nature. Maurice Mearleau-Ponty's phenomenological perspec ve of how humans understand the world through the framework of the self and the body, the consciousness of others, as well as the effects of the environment and how all these perspec ves create an accumulated understanding of the human consciousness, is consistent with this framework. He addresses the experien al learning process of each case in detail in Phenomenology of Percep on. From a phenomenological understanding of human nature, Max-Neef's contextual breakdown of human needs makes logical sense and it is also coherent within a cogni ve framework. From the perspec ve of Ann Sussman and Jus n Hollander, as biological creatures we are a part of nature, and to be er understand how to design for human nature and behaviours, we must first understand human nature rela ve to human biology. The closer in tune the built environment is with the way human beings are designed to exist and func on, the be er suited it will be to ensure overall human wellbeing. While phenomenology looks at experience and understanding this view is founded on a

which has proven that the environment does affect our individual wellbeing and social behavior (Kopec, 2006, p. 54). However, understanding the role of the environment is only part of the soluon. The environment must be engaged in rela on to all other contexts of the system of needs. What is clearer through Max-Neef's theory is that, through the visual matrix of needs and sa sfiers, it becomes clear that the environment, and by extension architecture plays a direct role in the actualiza on of all needs. Human ac on is mo vated by human needs, as both Maslow and Max-Neef's theories suggest, and a building is also the result of an ac on mo vated by a program of needs. However, to apply either theory to an architectural solu on can be difficult. While Maslow's theory provides a hierarchy with which to organize needs based on a func onal program, it does not reveal the interrelatedness of the theory's needs. Max-Neef's needs framework on the other hand, shows just how much overlap there is between his axiological needs categories, which are essen ally what Maslow's theory describes, and the way in which these needs can be sa sfied. The disadvantage of his matrix is its lack of hierarchy, which makes it difficult to focus on the specific needs of a complex func onal program. In order for the human ac vity system to frame an architectural problem, it has to show the interrelatedness of the needs, and provide a hierarchy with which to organize those needs. By restructuring the hierarchy to create a hybrid of the two systems, the various categories of needs can be visibly related, and poten al emergent correla ons can be iden fied, through which they can be systemically addressed and sa sfied (see Fig 2.3).

psycho-physiological framework based on the premise that, "the more we understand how human beings are...the more crea vely and successfully we will be able to design and plan for them," (Sussman & Hollander, 2015, p. 1). The significance of Max-Neef's theory is that it proposes that human needs can be sa sfied in varying ways, interpre ng as ideal solu ons as those that sa sfy needs synergis cally, as a whole system. To quote Bachman, "To deal with complex systems then, it is clearly necessary to deal holis cally with overarching patterns of their behavior and not surrender to intui ve, first order, superficial, or mechanis c manipula ons of separate pieces of the puzzle," (Bachman, 2012, p. 38). The three contexts proposed by Max-Neef are congruent with both the human phenomenological and cogni ve understanding of the world, and can serve as a framework of human nature and pa erns by which to sa sfy human needs. While this approach might be used to address human needs in a holis c manner, the role of architecture has yet to be determined in this equa on. In order to design in a way that is sensi ve to human needs, the environmental context can be employed as a common denominator, by which the needs of all three contexts can be sa sfied. Ul mately, we exist and func on in space and every aspect of life is affected by the environmental se ng. This fact is reinforced through environmental science,

The hybridized system of the needs theories being used, to organize the needs within the thesis is based on the contexts proposed by Max-Neef, which have also been used to group Maslow's needs pyramid. At first glance, the prominence of the context in framing specific needs is evident, and illustrates how specific design objec ves can become the emphasis of a design exercise, around which other needs can be related and addressed rela ve to primary needs. It provides visible insight into where the needs/ sa sfiers shown in Max-Neef's matrix can fall within the various contexts, and allows designers to control how they relate to each other and how ul mately they can be synergis cally addressed. This allows for the needs/sa sfiers to be organized in a way that defines the role of different spaces, public or private, and their contribu ons to sa sfying both primary social needs and other secondary needs. This is par cularly useful for the development of the thesis, as it creates an easily manipulated framework in which to define the ac vity system that the ar fact system can be designed to support.

the case in a modernist building, the approach being developed here, proposes that space is best understood in rela on to the spaces to which it is related in the whole ar fact system, which in this case is a building. In similar fashion the rela onship between public or private spa al systems is understood holis cally in the context of the thesis (see Fig 2.4). Miller and Benhamou define the ar fact at the level of a social group or organiza on as a building. The ar fact is intended to support or facilitate human ac vity associated with it, and as Ferguson's inorganic defini on would describe it, is ordered by the ra onal manipula on of its elements, which in the context of a building is manipula on of space.

ARTIFACT SYSTEM: SPATIAL CONFIGURATIONS
The u litarian emphasis of func onalism, focuses on the efficiency of the designated func on or programma c assignment of a space in order for a designer to shape the space. This overly simplified design process was driven by the efficiency with which the desired program was carried out. This, in most cases, resulted in spaces that did li le to address the complexity of the spa al experience governing human mo va on and behavior. In Funconalism Revisited, Lang and Moleski discuss how experience and percep on influence and mo vate human behavior. Our accumulated individual experiences, or narra ves, as Sussman and Hollander refer to them, shape the way in which we perceive daily experiences and dictate how we feel and respond to these experiences. This allows us to cogni vely process and determine what opportuni es or affordances are available within a given space, and to modify ac vi es and behaviour to enable a person to create a more favorable situa on (Lang & Moleski, 2010, pp. 41, 43). Experience and percep on are subjec ve. However, all theories of human needs indicate that there are commonali es that all humans desire, such as social connec ons, which can be incorporated into design. Furthermore, environmental psychology informs how space and its ar cula on can contribute to an experience suppor ng various types of human ac vity. What is cri cal to the design of the ar fact system, is looking at spaces as elements within systems. While a space may be considered as autonomous and func on independently, as would be

Within this organiza on or system of space, it is extremely important to ensure that the overall configura on is perceived and can be understood as a holis c en ty, an argument supported by Bill Hillier, who interprets space as the machine for living (Hillier, 1996). This perspec ve can be supported by the way in which the experien al quali es of space, through percep on, are accumulated to create an overall concep on of the experien al quali es of a space. To put this into the context of public and private systems in a building, a corridor can again be employed to demonstrate how one space acts as an element, as opposed to an autonomous system. In the previous example, a corridor in a func onalist building was viewed as a device for moving people within the building, and its efficiency judged based on its ability to do so effec vely while op mizing on space. If a systems thinking approach were employed in the design of the corridor, it would be just one element in the system of public spaces in the building, and treated in a way where its func on supports and is supported by other spaces in the system.

The difference in the illustra on above, may be be er understood by comparing Unité d' Habita on and Mirador (see Fig.'s 2.5 & 2.6). The corridor system in Unité is designed as a means of moving people through the building and nothing more, while the public spaces consist of exterior spaces at ground level and the retail spaces located on the seventh and eight floors (Forster, 2006, pp. 74, 75). All are public spaces but there is no rela onship between the spaces. Furthermore, the experien al func onality is similarly discrete, and does enable the spaces to complement each other. As such, the corridors although public, can only play a minor role in the social life of the building. In contrast, Mirador's corridors are organized into a diverse collec on of interconnected spaces that are intended to contribute to social life within the building, essen ally func oning as a system. As such, the corridors are designed in a way that is more conducive to public life, i.e., open to the exterior, providing natural light and ven la on, large enough to accommodate comfortable social interac on between neighbours, and varied enough to provide a diversity of spaces among the corridors. In addi on to this system of interrelated corridors, are public spaces that are located within and around these corridors within the building, all of which contribute to an overall, varied experience of social spaces within the building. Ul mately, the public space is designed to func on holis cally, crea ng a synergy among the spaces that could not be achieved if func onal efficiency was addressed on an individual space basis.

pa erns, endorsed by Bachman and Salingaros respec vely. Regardless of the difference in perspec ve, the framework of human nature can s ll be applied to the three categories. Ul mately, to address human nature, it is impera ve that design is sensi ve to the complex system of needs which mo vate human ac vity. A systems approach focuses on the interrelatedness of human ac vity and mo va on, which informs the designer how space can be be er designed to support, not just a func on, but also other needs that are systemically related to func on. By understanding the way that needs are designed to be sa sfied in rela on to human pa erns, the ar fact that is designed is more likely to be sensi ve to the complexity of the ac vity needs/system.

In Sussman and Hollander in their Cogni ve Architecture, place a greater significance on the social and the environmental influence of design on the quality of spa al experience, while aspects of the self are understood in rela on to the social context, and meaning is derived from collec ve iden ty. What is most compelling about the approach they present, is the intent to sa sfy human need based on human nature and pa erns. Such an intent speaks to a be er understanding of complexity and use of

WEXPLOITING

DENSITY FOR SOCIAL NEEDS

A defining characteris c of ci es is their density. A specific result of their popula on density there is the corresponding diversity of interests that exist within a concentrated area, a diversity that does not generally exist outside of ci es. This diversity can greatly enhance the quality of social life within the city. The same can also be said at a smaller scale, in a high density building. In theory, an ideal city is planned so that its basic societal needs are dispersed, to create an equal distribu on of resources across its territory. The distribu on of the public spaces, as defined in the previous chapter, within the context of the thesis project, will be organized in a similar way to ensure an even distribu on of and access to social spaces at the building scale. The ac vity ar fact system rela onship will be explored, and the social needs, as defined by the ac vity system, adequately supported by the ar fact, the building, through an equal distribu on of public spaces. In the context of this thesis, the ac vity system is defined by any ac on intended to sa sfy human needs, as understood through the hybridized hierarchy discussed in the previous chapter. The hierarchy of needs in turn governs the logic that drives spa al organiza on of the ar fact system which at the scale of the group is a building. In this connec on the thesis project will explore housing at the urban level, while the focal element or aspect of human needs being explored will be the social needs. The result is a spa al system that focus on the rela onship between public and private areas of the building. How humans qualify their experiences depends on an understanding of how percep on and cogni on of phenomenon occur, and how they influence not only our behaviour but also the physical and mental wellbeing of every individual. Much effort has been expended to describe how we sense and what we sense: scien fic qualifica on and understanding is based on a process of simplifying phenomena in order to comprehend and define them. However, this cannot easily be done because of the complexity in which we sense and perceive external informa on. To fully understand how percep on works, it is insufficient to rely exclusively on the empirical evidence which science can provide. Part of percep on stems from consciousness and from experienal memories, which allow us to interpret and understand what we gather through various sensorial s muli. Phenomenological theory suggests that we develop an understanding of the world through accumulated experiences, which are created through these sensorial s muli as we begin to become aware of the self and the outer world. Humans perceive and interpret phenomena, through which they later understand similar phenomena,

because they apply their ini al knowledge of the former to that of the la er. They learn and understand through experience. This process is applied to their senses, percep on and understanding of the world (Merleau-Ponty & Landes, 2014). As humans develop, their various experiences create memories and associa ons which shape their percep on and understanding of their surroundings. They begin to categorize or "schema ze" concepts which are applied to new informa on that is perceived. This is also part of the social condi oning process (Norberg-Schulz, 1968). Something else that contributes to their understanding of the world as they develop is the rela onships shared with others. They begin to inform each other and their understanding of the world. Cultural and social experiences thereby play a role in perceiving and understanding the world. The understanding of others as a separate consciousness with shared perceptual fields affects how one perceives and acts with others. Percep on is a process of learning and accumula ng experience that beings at childhood. This process occurs within social setngs, meaning that what is learned is not isolated from individual experience, but is influenced by collec ve social consciousness as well. From a phenomenological perspec ve, social rela onships with others are inseparable from how one perceives and understands the world. Social rela onships become part of individual iden es, as one begins to understands the world and self-identy through the eyes of others. In addi on to the significance of a perceptual understanding of the world through others, different micro-cultures of various social collec ves play important roles in the overall wellbeing of the individual. Part of an individual's experience takes place within the social realm. People share space with others and establish common meaning for that space. In a house or community for example, meaning is individual, but it is also shared with other members of the group. This idea can be extended to the larger community and the various social networks that make up parts of individual iden es (Bloomer & Moore, 1977). The space that is shared with others reinforces exis ng rela onships, which are essen al for psychological wellbeing. Based on these arguments the social nature of humans may be deemed an essen al considera on for the design of a high-density urban environment.

RELATING THE UNIT, TO THE BUILDING, TO THE CITY
What is most cri cal in the systems approach in an urban context, is the rela onship between public and private spaces, parcularly housing than other typologies. Human needs theories acknowledge that people need places for social interac on. Con-

versely there is also a need for private space as well, which necessitates balance between the two spa al systems. For this reason, some nego a on between how people are grouped, scaled, and distributed into social units, and the proximi es within spaal configura ons, is necessary. These considera ons become significant, affec ng the overall form and defining a building as an autonomous spa al system, exis ng as a microsystem within the larger city scale. As these internal rela onships are dra ed in the design process, they too begin to define emergent func onal rela onships between architectural posi ves and nega ves, elements and spaces, respec vely, which define the boundaries between public and private spaces and systems. For example, from a different perspec ve, one might ques on the level or extent of privacy necessary in these socio-spa al rela onships. The atypical spa al dynamic could effec vely evolve social es within a built space. As a smaller system or subsystem within the city, and one which is to be integrated with and contribute to its immediate context, a building can benefit from a similar framework, based on a city's organiza onal structure. Just as the city has a fair distribu on of special func ons and common func ons, a building can be organized where specialized func ons are strategically distributed and interconnected through the internal pedestrian system comprised of the building's public spaces ­ that is, it's shared or communal spaces ­ which are connected to the private spaces or units. Similarly, private spaces can be arranged within the building in such a way as to create a hierarchy of social rela onships, thus affording individuals the opportunity to create closer personal es based on proximity, instead of finding themselves lost in an endless grouping of units.

the residents. Also, the space was accessible to the wider public, thereby promo ng connec vity to the immediate context. The site, originally zoned for six single-family units, was given a much larger allotment for the shared space, and increased the density to 25 units. From a systems perspec ve, the scheme ques oned the spa al needs of private spaces in rela on to public spaces. Based on a different view of this rela onship and the needs of the residents, it repriori zed the balance within the two systems of space. Also, due to increased density and the changing propor ons, it became important to use the public space as a buffer to ensure ample privacy within the high density neighbourhood. Again, because of the altered space propor on, and the proximity and placement of the windows and entrances, there was sufficient space around the units to ensure that the communal space provided ample distance between units. Despite what could be considered a restric ve urban boundary, the shi in spa al priority between the systems created an environment which could promote social rela ons while maintaining scale sensi vity appropriate to the density. This fostered comfort, as spaces were not cramped and residents did not feel pressured within either spa al system.

8 HOUSE: COPENHAGEN, BIG
Circulation + Movement The 8 House program was required to integrate a mixture of commercial and residen al space into a newly developing commuter area in Copenhagen, adjacent to exis ng farmlands. The design objec ves essen ally required a building that would create an acve urban realm for commerce, social interac on and connec on with both the surrounding new development and the farmland adjacent to the site. The form conceived by the architect extended an ac ve and walkable street into the third dimension. In so doing, the architect was able to achieve a ramping Mobius strip, allowing con nuous pedestrian traffic along both residen al and commercial frontages. The design layered the program horizontally to separate private and public realms. This allowed privacy for the residences while maintaining a con nuum of pedestrian traffic through both realms. The scheme also addressed how social interac on occurs at a more in mate scale. The threshold where the residen al units meet the ramp consists of a small landing with individual planters at each unit. As simple as this was, it allowed a gradient between the privacy of the unit and inclusivity of what is essen ally a public street. The buffer provides a zone which can nego ate the nature of social interac on between the resident and the guest or passerby. The social pockets around the ramp, including the main courtyards, provide ad-

HABITAT 67: MONTREAL, MOSHE SAFDIE
View + Variation Habitat was designed to privilege each unit with uninterrupted views of nature and to create a sense of individuality among residents through what appears to be units that are varied and unique. The formal approach of organizing the units on a single loaded corridor oriented at forty-five degrees to the units themselves and units that are modular but rotate based on their locaon in the scheme, created a modular system that was able to achieve the intended design goals. What this also created was a unique proximal rela onship between the units, which effec vely allowed units to have a certain degree of visual access to the balconies and open spaces of other units. By organizing the units in this way, the design allowed for a sense of individuality among the units while simultaneously helping to create an atmosphere that is conducive to familiarity among residents in neighbouring units and thus an environmental poten al for social interac on. If the scheme were analysed in terms of a systems perspec ve, it would demonstrate the rela onship between the public and private systems, which had allowed for privacy yet s ll maintained allowances for social interac on among residents. The corridor system, rela ve to the orienta on of the private system, the units, created a dynamic collec on of varied spa al condi ons. Essenally by the synergis c rela onship between the two systems, the public system benefi ed the private one, crea ng unique visual experience of the site and scheme through the proximity and spa al rela onships between units.

units to extend across the en re block, the units are privy to a direct visual connec on to the facing units and the ac vity of the market below. The effect for the residents, is crea on of a unique experience of a part of the city and city life, which has the potenal to create a unique sense of place translatable into personal and social es to the market and home. For the market patrons and city pedestrians, the scale it presents on the ground floor in par cular takes advantage of the height of the residen al canopy protec ng it from the elements. The glass façades also cap the views of the city on either side of what is a portal, framing and connec ng the city beyond. The massing essen ally allows the market to appear as a mere sheltered space within the city, not disconnected from its context. What the project achieves is a clear separa on of public realm and private spaces through the ar cula on of the form. At the same me the formal and programma c rela onship creates a unique experience of space for both spa al systems. The systems also relate to each other, whereas individual systems analysed on their own, could be considered typical to other residen al or market typologies.

Residential, Commercial & City Integration While the building massing and cons tuent elements, the residences and the market, are fairly simply put together, overall this project is a clear example of how the two programs are synergis cally combined into a mutualis c rela onship resul ng in a project where the whole is greater and more beneficial than the individual parts would be. Looking at the residen al component, the individual units' interior circula on and organiza on is not vastly dissimilar from what would be expected of a slab block. What makes the social condi on unique is the rela onship on the interior, between the units and the market. Not only do the units create an enclosure over the market, but by organizing the

By analyzing housing in this framework, one can be er understand how the balance between these two systems can result in a more humanis c architecture. In each case the analysis defines the ac vity system based on needs expressed through the individual design intent of each project. In all cases the ac vity is supported by the way in which the spa al systems are organized which is, defined by the physical ar cula on of the architectural elements. The precedents thus serve as good examples of how various architectural devices are capable of crea ng an architectural ar fact that addresses human ac vity, which is itself defined as a product of human needs.

4| SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT

FORM AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION
As previously stated, popula on density comes with many advantages, par cularly social density and diversity. However, the higher the density, the greater the challenge is to design the built form in a way that can accommodate a liveable environment that remains sensi ve to the human condi on. In higher density urban environments, the challenge necessarily becomes a balancing act between the horizontal and ver cal dimension. The rela onship between these spa al dimensions has direct implica ons for the physical quali es of urban form and, consequently, for its overall spa al experience. Rudolph Arnheim discusses the nature of the rela onship between the horizontal and ver cal axes, and how it affects spa al experience. He discusses the primacy of the ver cal axis and the fact that we experience movement in space through the horizontal axis. As a result of the way in which human beings orient themselves from gravity, primacy is given to the ver cal axis, as it is the only consistent source of orienta on. Due to this, the effect of horizontal and ver cal percep on is quite significant to how we feel, in habit, understand and experience space (Arnheim, 1977). The issue he discusses that is most per nent to the thesis, is the impact on social integra on and sense of hierarchy inherent in form that emphasises one orienta on over the other. Using Frank Lloyd Wright's houses as examples he remarks on how, "The horizontal style of living promotes interac on, free mobility from place to place, and ease of progress, whereas vercally-oriented living stresses hierarchy, isola on, ambi on, and compe on," (Arnheim, 1977, pp. 38, 39). This principle can be applied at different scales to larger buildings and urban environments. This can be readily perceived in public corridors and streets, where horizontality encourages freedom of movement and openness, while ver cal elements and boundaries create variety, hierarchy and define and give meaning to the horizontal plane. In well-designed spaces, the combina on of the ver cal and horizontal elements define areas that are scaled appropriately for socializa on. However, it is also well understood that there are limita ons of the ver cal and horizontal dimensions which must be adhered to which support to social interac on. Christopher Alexander among others discuss how, in the context of a street, one becomes detached from the social life of the ground plane beyond four stories, while the shadows cast from higher buildings detract from the warmth of the street level (Alexander, 1977, pp. 15-18). As demonstrated by case studies examined in the previous chapter, many different architectural devices govern the rela onship between private and public spa al systems. As briefly discussed

above, the rela onship between ver cal and horizontal dimensions is a cri cal factor that affects the spa al poten al for social integra on within a built work. For the purposes of this thesis, the explora on of form will focus on how horizontality and ver cality affect how the spa al organiza on (architectural nega ve) and the ar cula on of elements (architectural posi ves) can define the rela onship between the public and private spa al system of the design project. While the spa al configura on is unques onably important, space is inhabited but it is not what is actually seen and interacted with. For this reason, the ar cula on of the elements is what actually defines space and what allows one to perceive space. Furthermore, it is the elements that define spaal boundaries and hierarchies and ul mately give unity and coherence to a built work

SYSTEMS APPROACH TO SPACES AND ELEMENTS
The main shortcoming presented in func onalist design is an oversimplifica on of what is defined as func onality and the independence of spaces which fail to address the interconnected nature of human need and experience (ac vity system). The soluon outlined here, seeks to approach the design process through a systems thinking methodology, whereby individual spaces are understood as a series of interrelated spa al condi ons, designed and formed with an intent to mold each other towards a holis c experience. These spaces are expected to promote social integraon throughout the building (ar fact) system which can then be scaled as required to incorporate the building system in a similar way as the subsystem of a city. Strategies derived from engaging design based on rela onships between public and private systems is aimed at a holis c funconality as opposed to an independent, spa al func onality. As with human needs systems, these spa al systems are interac ve and should be sa sfied based on how the systems relate and influence each other. In order to create a building that func ons holis cally, an environment in which social integra on is promoted must also be manifest. The design process, which will address the systemic rela onship of spaces, will first be engaged through the design of the spa al organiza on and elemental ar cula on. Consistent with Hillier's argument for `space as the machine' spaal configura ons are cri cal. "Very few of the purposes for which we build buildings and environments are not `people configura ons' in this sense. We should therefore in principle expect that the rela on between people and space, if there is one, will be found at the level of the configura on of space rather

than the individual space," (Hillier, 1996, p. 30). In the context of the thesis, his discussion supports an emphasis on spa al rela onships as a means of crea ng a design that can support social integra on. By configuring space in a way where individual spaces func on in a mutualis c system, the building as a whole system, the ar fact, is designed in coherence with human sensi vity to form and space and supports human needs, the ac vity.

II. Pedestrian Exposure: allowing the ac vity within the building (its pedestrian life), to animate all areas in the building. The circula on will be exposed to all areas and concentrated to create an augmented percep on of life within the public areas. III. Spatial Definition: create a gradient of spaces sized and ar culated to create a diversity of social scales within the building. These elements of the public system (shared spaces) will be designed to be sensi ve to the number of people occupying the space and the privacy required by adjacent private system (units). IV. Spatial Ambiguity: Defining spaces in a way that their extents are clear but use perceive the boundary elements are perceived and not material, thereby allowing flexibility of ac vity and pedestrian movement.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS
The strategies and tac cs that will govern this process will therefore focus, first, on the spa al configura ons and, second, on how they are ar culated in order to ensure that spaces are func onal individually and can act as a cohesive whole. The strategies are intended to ensure that spaces are designed in a way which will allow them to contribute to the overall experience of the building and create mutualis c rela onships will other spaces. Design strategies for addressing rela onships between spa al requirements of public spaces versus private spaces will be governed by the following strategies and their corresponding tac cs:

|2| PATTERN CONGRUENCE: Human are designed
to sa sfy needs in ways that are natural to their physical and psychological condi on. Sensi vity to how sa sfacon occurs in norma ve circumstances and how sa sfiers can exist together is important in order to design within the tested laws of the human condi on and not outside of it. Space and the built environment play a fundamental role in media ng social rela ons and as such the way that space is ar culated should be sensi ve to how people behave and are affected by space and spaal quali es. By understanding the rules of the exis ng socio-spa al pa erns, a synthesis that is conducive to how both individual and social needs have evolved to be achieved. I. Socio-Spatial Logic: balancing horizontal vs Ver cal elements to encourage social interacon while create variety through a hierarchy of spa al condi ons.

Social Organization: cluster private spaces in quan es that supports meaningful social rela ons and create diversity within groups by mixing unit types within clusters. III.

|1| INTENTION PRIORITIZING: In many mul -residen al composi ons, units are given priority over social amenity spaces in terms of the views, building loca on and access to light. Further, they are typically posi oned where they become isolated des na ons within the building, preven ng poten al for random engagement with the spaces. While reasons for giving priority of these elements to units are understandable, they do not negate the fact that social spaces require similar treatment to be successfully u lized. There must also be meaningful contribu on to the social atmosphere and, ul mately, community cohesion of the place. The social infrastructure and the individual units were organized in a way that would not diminish common spa al requirements of the units. Equilibrium was also established among social spaces, and the design encouraged usage of social spaces while s ll maintaining the quality of more private spaces and units. By balancing the priority weights of spaces, the overall building will be er address both social needs and individual needs. I. Balancing Resource Access: organizing the massing of the public and private systems so that the form allows access of to Light and Views to both systems

I. Visual Engagement: using varia on in architectural form of facades and spaces to create visual composi ons that can s mulate and engage occupants of other spaces and provide another means to animate views from mul ple vantage points.

INITIAL SYNTHESIS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Ini al inves ga ons looked at several spa al configura ons at two scales: an in mate human scale that addressed smaller social groupings, and a larger scale of the whole complex into which the smaller scaled groups would be combined (see Fig's 4.1-4.4). These ini al inves ga ons were all within a 4-6 storey height limit to maintain social distance between the top and street levels as well as to control availability of light. The resul ng interior condions took on the appearance of a small-scale streetscape, which became the primary repeatable element, scaled to human-sensive propor ons, responding to more in mate social scales (see Fig's 4.5-4.7). The overall structures were organized as groups

LIMITS OF FORM (INTENTION PRIORITIZING)
One of the interes ng realiza ons of this ini al a empt to create a more social environment was the fact that the resul ng spaces took on characteris cs of what is generally known to produce good social spaces in the public realm. The public realm is intended to sa sfy a mul plicity of social needs that can be addressed to some degree in the private realm. The reason this might not happen, lies with the argument that this thesis makes, namely that the spaces being designed do not address human needs systemically. In this case, the rela onship between public and private spaces was designed to allow more flexibility between the two, mediated at the social group scale, to create a more social environment, capable of sa sfying social and privacy needs. By understanding the nature of these human needs and how they are sa sfied in space the resul ng design becomes more systemic and responds to human needs. Subsequent inves ga ons were focused on a be er understanding of how form can be manipulated in different ways, par cularly to increase density while maintaining the in mate social nature of the spaces (see Fig. 4.9-4.10). As the form increased in scale, it became readily apparent that necessi es such as light and view had to be nego ated among spaces. By examining what are very basic spa al configura ons of residen al buildings a better understanding of the limits of their various spa al forms was reached and incorporated into a form which balanced these variables into one form (see Fig. 4.8). In light of this, if public spaces were to sa sfy needs in tandem with private spaces, it would mean that more priority would be given to those public spaces in terms of their design and resources such as light and view. This provided further cause to ques on the nature of the private and public divide, and how it could be nego ated to address both social and privacy needs.

DESIGNING FOR HUMANS (PATTERN CONGRUENCE)
While designing for increasing public and private spa al systems, it was necessary to ensure that the scale of the spaces was conducive to a comfortable social environment where meaningful rela onships could be fostered. For this reason, it was crucial to break down the larger space into smaller spaces that were appropriate. Various configura ons were used which balanced private with public spaces. The end result was a base cluster built around a small court which was large enough to act as an in mate common space serving as a shared social threshold (see Fig.'s 4.124.13). While this first level of social zones was intended to foster comfortable social interac on within an in mately scaled space, other levels are necessary for a similar social atmosphere throughout the en re building (see Fig. 4.11). At this scale, the private-public rela onship effec vely mimics a community environment where other socially related needs such as safety, security, and a sense of belonging can be addressed by crea ng a familiarity among clusters. Here the level moves from the cluster of units to floors of clusters, which are grouped in fours and are surrounded by social bridges. Furthermore, at the overall building scale, the building begins to act as an autonomous community environment that fosters social integra on through consistency in its social environment throughout. This environment and will be mimicked at the podium level to allow the grade condi on to foster similar social iden ty with the building's urban context.

SYSTEM SYMBIOSIS (RECIPROCITY DESIGN)

AND

COMPLEMENTARY
         

In all natural systems rela onships can be found between elements that are mutualis c. Through the lens of the human needs ac vity system and the context of the design project, the social life of the community is just as important to each individual as it is to the whole. This mutual need of the individual and the collec ve presents an opportunity to leverage the need into a spaal solu on that benefits both the individual and collec ve. The solu on that was explored, employed the circula on system as a means of, not merely connec ng and moving people through the spaces, but allowing the system to play a much more integral and ac ve part in the building's community life. By opening the form to allow the circula on to become an element animated with the life of the community, in a fashion similar to a street, it would become a place to watch and be watched. By changing the func on of the corridors from a path connec ng A's to B's, into a place where the life of the building is exhibited, the way in which it was ar culated in like manner had to change in order to accommodate its new func on. This change was capitalized on by adding balconies, which extended from the cluster spaces, both enlarging the spaces and encouraging movement in and out of the in mate spaces, further allowing social interac on across clusters (see Fig. 4.14). This physical and visual connec vity effec vely became a catalyst for redefining the func onal roles of other spaces within the building. The central core also provided another high-traffic space for casual encounters, which could further animate the building (see Fig. 4.15). This process of rethinking the func onal defini ons of public spaces by reconsidering how needs can systemically be sa sfied through spa al rela onships was explored in other areas of the building. The idea was explored in the relaonship between the shared spaces of the residences above, and the public domain below. Just as the life of the building became an asset to its community by exploi ng visual connec ons, life in the street ini ated a mutualis c rela onship between the ground plane and the private shared spaces above. The changing dynamics of the spa al func ons required a unique way of defining spaces. The spaces were intended to bleed into each other (see Fig.'s 4.16-4.18). They were designed with elements that defined implied spa al boundaries where possible to encourage movement, to be socially invi ng and not to be perceived as barriers (see Fig.'s 4.16-4.17). Where privacy was necessary, the elements were in contrast, ar culated with ma-

terials that clearly emphasized the physical boundary between shared and private. In so doing, the architectural elements became clear indicators of private and public spaces in the building. By clearly iden fying spa al ownership, and carefully managing the amount of public space around private spaces, the design encourages social interac on in the public spaces appropriate to the level of privacy needed around the private spaces. The most evident example is between the clusters and the main corridors. Here the materials which define the rela onship between public and private spaces limit social congrega on around the more private areas of the units, while allowing interac on in the areas that are designed to facilitate it while not preven ng access from

either space. It is a fact that humans need the society of others. However, soluons presented in most tall buildings to address this need, typically manifest in social ac vi es at grade or social spaces ­ amenity spaces ­ sca ered throughout a building. These are insufficient to create a sense of community within its walls. By understanding the complex nature of human needs and how they are best sa sfied systemically, the way in which the architectural problem and ul mately the solu on is engaged changes, as in the case of the design project. By inves ga ng the rela onship between needs, social versus privacy needs for example, we change the way we address these needs. This creates a different func onal defini on of how we a empt to sa sfy these needs based on that understanding. In the case of the project, a more plausible way of crea ng a socially favorable environment is developed where social needs are balanced with privacy needs.

5| SOLUTION APPLICATION

DENSITY IN CONTEXT
As evidenced through the case study analysis and preliminary design research, the human environment rela onship engaged through the framework of the human ac vity and ar fact system is a viable way of ensuring a design that is both func onal and sensi ve to human needs. To demonstrate the validity of the prac cal applica on of this asser on, the thesis project will use the proposed systems framework to develop a residen al scheme focused on social integra on. Within an urban environment and in accordance with the idea of systems scaling, the design project will manifest as an autonomous system of public and private spaces at the building scale. Further, it will extend into the urban fabric at the city scale, where it becomes an element within its immediate context. Given the urban context, the project will reflect through its spa al organiza on the primacy of social needs, and be ar culated in a way that reflects the interrelatedness of the human needs system as it relates to its social objec ves. To test the strategies of the thesis, the design project will be sited in Toronto. The high-density housing stock most prevalent in Toronto, par cularly in the urban core, is the tower podium configura on, an evolu on of Corbusier's Radiant City model, which results in programma c compartmentaliza on. While the model was intended to open the ground plane and to allow a more ac ve pedestrian life, the combina on of programma c stra fica on and prominence of vehicular traffic has le much to be desired of the pedestrian plane. Despite all its promise, this has been a problem with the housing stock of Toronto that has evolved from the post-war slab blocks to the contemporary point towers that dominate the urban core. In as much as it is understood that quali es such as human-scaled spaces and variety make for good social spaces, the quality of social environments is based on more than the quan ty and quality of individual spaces. As argued in this thesis, quality in the complex of a real world environment results from how the spaces func on as a unit. As such, through the lens of systems theory, it becomes apparent that a residen al building, composed of a collec on of social spaces, built around private units, is not sufficient to foster a social environment across either the building or its urban environment. Essen ally in both the slab-block configura on and the point tower, there are public spaces and private spaces, but the two types offer no real rela onship capable of fostering a social environment. What further worsens poten al for social engagement is the fact that in point towers in par cular, while the overall density is increased by height, the social density per floor is greatly minimized. This further exacerbates social isola on with-

in tall buildings, which occurs due to lack of social integra on, which exists and increases the more distant one is from the social life of the street (Alexander, 1977). The physical form of high-density housing in Toronto does very li le to contribute to the social life of its occupants. Despite the advantage of freeing the ground plane and increasing density, the point tower does nothing more than allow people to live in one spot. While some towers can serve as landmarks or icons, the density that exists and con nues to appear as a product of this typology is unsustainable. What is being promoted as an alterna ve to the point tower is the construc on of midrise development along the larger avenues throughout the city (Gillis, 2013). In keeping with the idea of designing the building to be an element within the larger system of its immediate urban context, the design will abide by the proposed development recommenda ons for midrise housing. By complying the project will adopt the rules that govern the rela onship among the other elements of the urban-scaled ar fact system. This compliance is possible because the rules that govern the midrise recommenda ons are consistent with the strategies that address human-sensi ve design, specifically the Pa ern Congruence strategy. Essen ally the midrise development is aimed at crea ng more human-sensi ve environments (Gillis, 2013), which is the ul mate goal of the Pattern Congruence strategy and by extension this thesis, therefore the rules that govern the behavior of the spa al systems of the building are not in conflict with those at the city scale. For this reason, the midrise developments along avenues are appropriate for the site selec on of the thesis project. The specific site chosen is at the intersec on of Bathurst Street and Adelaide Street West (see Fig. 5.2). The site sits on the boundary between commercial midrises where the Fashion, Entertainment and Financial Districts are located, and a large area of low-rise residen al units. It is well connected by transit with exis ng pedestrian laneways, connec ng in and around the immediate vicinity. Proximity to the residen al and commercial elements will provide an opportunity to allow the public elements of the design to be integrated into the urban fabric and be amenable to the scaling of the public and private systems from the building to the city.

FORMAL EVOLUTION
The ideas discussed in this research were employed in the design to create a socially integrated high density housing prototype. The design focused on the three main scales that are intended to build gradient of social se ngs within the project: the in mate or cluster scale, the floor group scale and the building scale, which also addresses how the building in turn meets the urban site. The strategies and tac cs developed in the research were further refined based on various texts which address the design of human-sensi ve spaces. These include primarily, Rudolph Arnheim's The Dynamics of Architectural Form, Christopher Alexander's A Pa ern Language, Jan Gehl's Ci es for People and William Whyte's The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces. The Ac vity system, as established in the research, suggests a change in the func onal descrip on of public and private spaces. The design project therefore will achieve a more social environment through manipula on of both private and public space as two separate but mutualis c spa al systems.

        

EXISTING TYPE ­ THE SLAB BLOCK
A typical slab block configura on was selected as a base for several reasons revealed in the preliminary research (see Fig. 5.1). First, the double-loaded corridor system provides a favourable ra o between circula on space, the primary spa al element in the public space system, and the private space system. The basic formal configura on can be easily manipulated to change the propor onal rela onship between systems as needed. The second reason is that the double-loaded corridor system can be indefinitely extended and effec vely is only limited by the site or the impact the scale of the massing may have on the surrounding area. The double-loaded corridor system can also be easily configured in mul ple ways to best suit the site or broken into smaller components for formal varia on or ar cula on. Finally, the form is defined by its length, which is dissimilar from a point tower configura on. For example, it creates more opportuni es for horizontal circula on. Based on Arnheim's wri ngs, horizontality, and by extension horizontal movement, creates spaces which are more conducive to social integra on. While this is an advantage, there must be some sensi vity as to how it meets the grade condi on to ensure that the mass remains permeable. These favorable condi ons should also allow the main mass to connect to the base and not become a massive barrier across the site rela ve to the street. By virtue of this configura on, the form should be more readily amenable to a high density of social interac on across individual floors.

PUBLIC/PRIVATE SYSTEM HIERARCHIES & GROUPINGS
The second stage takes the massing and configures the base's hierarchical rela onships between the public and private systems (see Fig. 5.3). The horizontality encourages movement and social integra on, while the level of in macy and hierarchy is established by the ver cal ar cula on of space into clusters as this is more likely to promote in macy and closer social es (see Fig. 5.4). The floors are divided in two stages that are defined by the corridors of the public system. The floors are divided into groups of four levels as a first step. By organizing the floors into groups of fours the ver cal height within the group is kept within a limit that permits social interac on. To be er define the group and reinforce the physical connec on across the group, a social link (the social bridges) is incorporated into the public system (see Fig. 5.6). Within this height restric on of the group the social link can effec vely serve a similar func on to the street and create a common public space servicing that group. The second level consists of the hierarchy of the private system, the units, and the rela onships the groups share with the public system. The units are clustered in groups of eight to twelve, organized around a common courtyard appropriately scaled to balance privacy with adequate space for social interac on among group members. The courtyard acts as a threshold condi on between residents, thereby crea ng a space to interact without having to invade one's personal space. Each cluster occupies two floors and is connected to the main public space system via corridors on the lower floor. While the clusters create the first level of social in macy within the building, they are s ll connected to the wider community by the corridors. This creates a social gradient connecting residents in various degrees, thereby taking advantage of the larger horizontal scale for which the base was selected. Finally, by concentra ng the movement along the corridors on two of the four floors within each group, it increases the chances for interac on outside of the first level of in macy within the public system. The third level of in macy would be defined by encounters incident at the common links and lobby areas. By crea ng the gradient between the level of in macy between the public and private systems, each system informs how the spaces of the other are propor oned. This also ensures that balance is maintained in the rela onship regardless of the scale the overall form expands to, similar to a street in the city.

SYSTEM PRIORITIZING
At the previous stage, the rela onship between public and private systems created internal condi ons between the corridor, courtyards and units. The change in rela onship necessitates that the form be modified to allow equity of resources, light, views, and so forth, to all units and between the public and private systems ­ the idea being, that if the public system is to be a shared asset of the private system, the spa al elements of which the system is composed should become places that contribute to the overall posi ve experience and social interac on of the whole building. By splaying the ends of the masses, it opens up the cores and the interior condi ons to light, ven la on and views of the city (see Fig. 5.5). The opposing mass, which is located at a distance that allows visibility across the building, does not create privacy issues across the floor. Again, the split across the massing at similar floor groups creates another opportunity to observe the life of the building in the same way one that might from a house in a street condi on. Further, the social bridges provide opportuni es to localize complementary ameni es that have poten al to increase chance happenings within the building (see Fig. 5.6). One such mutualis c pairing is that of a laundry room, typically housed in a basement and a recrea on room. Although, as the former is not a typical social catalyst, by providing a space in close proximity in an environment such as the landscaped bridge space above, or an ac vity room below, it would create a different dynamic than would a typical basement laundry facility. Essen ally again by rethinking how public spaces work as a unified system, opportunies such as these groups allow for more chance encounters in a greater diversity of social environments. Addi onally, a posi ve outcome of opening the masses is the opportunity it creates for the mass to be penetrated at ground level. This ini ated the process of ar cula ng how the overall mass began to address the street condi on and connected its local area.

CONNECTING TO THE CITY
The private and public systems were developed together, which gave shape to the overall form in stages. This ini ally involved massaging the two systems and two massings (see Fig. 5.7). The programma c elements of the podium are similarly organized to create a mutualis c rela onship between its individual elements. The interior circula on and the various programma c elements are visually and physically connected to each other. They overlap crea ng various internal condi ons for a diverse set of working condi ons that would be ideal for a co-working facility as well as for other small offices. In the same way that the residen al units are organized to create a gradient of social condi ons that benefit interac on among the residents, the podium creates gradient condi ons across its different commercial spaces, allowing different interac ons along strips of program. Further, the exterior pathways meander through the site, thereby allowing a variety of connec ons across the site. The space between these site paths creates pockets for gardens and sea ng across the site, much like the corridor system above, and animates the public system at grade (see Fig. 5.8).

MASSING AND FORMAL ARTICULATION
ADELAIDE STREET

Finally, the massing is refined to reflect the ar cula on of the spaces and groupings. In so doing the mass is broken up and scaled to provide varia on, as opposed to remaining as a solid mass above the podium. In as much as the mass is limited in height it is s ll important to ar culate the mass in order to contribute to the street edge. The lower floors of the residen al units are given larger balconies to allow residents close in proximity to street level to par cipate in ac va ng the ground level. The balconies are angled and staggered to mimic the form of the main massing and the podium elements. On the interior, the courtyards, give way to balcony extensions that penetrate the corridor walls and create another means of interac on across the overall scheme. Another layer of in macy between the courtyard and the overall massing animates the building core, thereby exhibi ng the life of the building to the residents, the street and the courtyard below.

BY CHANGING THE SPATIAL CONFIGURATION AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRIVATE AND SHARE SPACE THE SOCIAL GRADIENT IS SHIFTED FROM A TYPICALLY VERTICAL MODEL TO A HORIZONTAL ONE.

SOCIAL GRADIENT ACROSS MID-SECTION OF BUILDING

|FIG 5.9|Transverse Section showing social gradients across building.

In a typical high rise apartment, social interac on is very limited among residents. It is minimal across floors and sporadic in designated social areas at best. While housing is generally intended to fulfil certain basic needs, such as shelter, warmth, security, and so forth, the func onal defini on of housing can s ll fall short of addressing human needs holis cally. This ul mately results in an environment which, despite mee ng basic needs, may s ll have a nega ve impact on quality of life. Humans need social engagement but unless space works systemically to promote a social environment, the space cannot counteract against social isola on within large buildings. What the design project demonstrates is that a be er understanding of how different needs exist and work within a holis c framework, in what theory defines as the ac v-

ity system, can facilitate a more accurate func onal defini on of the ar fact, which will be er respond to human needs. A be er understanding of the rela onship between the ac vity and the ar fact systems, in this case, resulted in a design where the social gradient effec vely shi ed from the single, normal, ver cal direcon, where social isola on is typical, to a model where the gradient exists in two direc ons (see Fig.'s 5.9-5.10). In this model, social interac on is much less likely to occur, not only because of the axial shi , but because the shi allowed the spaces to be configured in a way that presented opportuni es for implementa on of other known successful pa erns within the design.

6| SOLUTION TESTING

SENSITIVITY TO SCALES
Throughout the various stages of design explora on, what was most prominent was orchestra on of the architectural spaces and elements at the different focus scales which mediated the rela onship between public and private areas to sa sfy both social and privacy needs. Although the processes that prompted the scaling were primarily concerned with the configura on, sizes and proximi es of the spaces, the actual spa al quality is equally affected by materiality and ar cula on of the architectural elements. The elements which defined each space were chosen to be sensi ve to the human scale and arranged so that their organiza on could be an appropriate response at the different social scales being addressed. The overall massing was the result of allowing the two main masses to exhibit themselves both to each other and to the city beyond. However, the sizes of the masses necessitated their reduc on to a scale appropriate to human propor ons. The social hierarchy that divided the building into three groups of four floors was the first step in the process of reducing the mass. Secondly, by varying the different floors, the overall massing appeared more ar culated and closer to human propor ons than it was as an undefined extrusion. Addi onally, the podium and the social bridges and spaces on the fi h and ninth floors, introduced another means to divide the building and provide more varia on to the form, further anima ng the façades, from inside and outside of the site. By subdividing the mass in this manner, each mass became an architectural composi on viewable from all spaces within the social hierarchy and from the city itself. While massing reduced the overwhelming size of the form, the materials further broke down elements to a level of detail appropriate for human propor on. They were chosen to create a warm ambiance and appropriate level of visual s mula on that could promote social interac on. As such, specific colours and materials were chosen. This pallet was applied throughout the building, allowing social areas to feel warm and welcoming, and to be easily iden fiable throughout the building. Addi onally, while there were various fixed elements incorporated into the structure, most furniture was proposed as moveable, allowing users a greater sense freedom, addressing needs of ownership and the need to belong while sa sfying social interac on. Ul mately, the massing subdivision and the ar cula on of the spa al elements were poten ally the most important aspects of transla ng theore cal ideas into physical reality. At each scale, the massing, form and materiality contributed significantly to spa al quality, to promote social interac on and retain privacy.

CLUSTER SCALE
The cluster was the most in mate scale within the building and needed, more than anywhere else, to exude a warmth which could be associated with a welcoming social atmosphere that would encourage the residents in its units to perceive the shared space as an extension to their own private spaces. The elements perceived as the coldest and most aliena ng, the concrete structure, were so ened using warm colours. Addi onally, these hard surfaces were so ened using wooded elements and plant materials that also contributed to a level of visual s mula on necessary to allow the users to be engaged with the environment. Use of glass allowed for a visual connec vity from within the units to the cluster, and from the cluster to the building. Its absence would have inhibited social integra on and fluidity between spaces. The choice of glass in these areas is the most significant influence on social nature. The ra onale is that, while its use may infringe on privacy, glazing can be protected as required by the residents as need, allowing them to control how they interact with their neighbours. Using an opaque material places the choice in the hands of the designer, which greatly limits poten al for social interac on. Similar to moveable furniture the layout offers as much flexibility as possible to allow residents to nego ate among themselves how the space is used. Ul mately the choice of materials created an engaging environment which was welcoming to it residents. It was designed to be a place that affords and is conducive to different types of ac vity, can feed of the life of the adjacent spaces and reciprocates its own liveliness to other spaces.

FLOOR GROUP SCALE
At the floor group scale, the choice of materiality, free furniture and landscaping is very similar to the cluster scale, in order to humanize the main structure and create a consistency in the atmosphere and language of social spaces throughout the building. The use of glass here is more impac ul than any other scale. While the proximity between masses provides sufficient privacy between masses, use of glass allows public spaces to feel open and to permit people to see and know who the members of their immediate and wider community are. At this scale it is also necessary to subdivide the various massings to ensure that all elements remain sensi ve to human propor ons. The design was based on the premise that horizontality encourages social integra on. However even the horizontal bands of solids and voids had to be subdivided to ensure visual variety. For this reason, hierarchy among the horizontal planes was created using ver cals in a pa ern that created the necessary variety while maintaining a horizontal expression. The floor group scale is arguably the most cri cal scale. While the cluster addresses needs of ownership and individuality, and allows for in mate rela onships, the group scale reinforces a greater sense of belonging among the immediate floors through casual interac on with the immediate community. Ul mately, this serves as a bridge between most in mate and most public spaces.

BUILDING SCALE
The building as a whole en ty becomes an object in the city. As opposed to the other two scales, the building scale is able to address social needs. However, the idea of the building as a place is established in the minds of residents through the cluster and floor divisions. What the building as a place, can provide to further iden fy is more variety to the resident and to the city, reinforcing its value to both communi es. This is achieved through the ground plane and the podium condi on. Similar to the process of dividing the building mass, the ground plane is divided to create different sizes of spaces that can accommodate different group sizes and different ac vi es. Also mimicking the process above, the spaces are ar culated with similar landscaping and materials, which so en the hard edges and make the spaces more suitable to social interac on. The areas are divided by pedestrian paths through the site which allow these groups spaces to be constantly ac vated in social engagement through the flow of people moving through a local pedestrian laneway network. At this scale, the building allows itself to become an integral place within its wider context, crea ng social opportunity within the city through materiality, scale, openness and exposure, in a similar way to the private residen al network described above.

While the overall form is divided to reduce the overpowering size of the building, it has to be further reduced to allow the spaces it creates in both internally in the residences and externally in and around the site to support a social interaction in the public realm. For this reason, the various balconies, windows and the floor planes were the architectural tools employed to create achieve this requirement. In addition these elements explored different arrangements to create a greater sense of variation to prevent a monotonous and unstimulating experience from any point in or around the building.

A en on to the scale of space has contributed more to the design than any other tac c. However, spa al percep on can also be greatly influenced by the materiality, texture and colour, the elements that give form to abstract ideas of scale and space. Essen ally, spa al dimensions, while important to behavior, are only one part of an equa on that determines whether a space can support social integra on. Although virtual, the renderings demonstrate the type of spa al quali es that the thesis asserts are capable of encouraging social integra on within a building of certain scale. They show the importance of how the scales of the different spaces and the rela ve proximi es of one space to another can allow a space that may normally be considered completely private, to be opened to in a way that privacy is s ll kept but also encourages social integra on within a small group.

CONCLUSION
We exist in world that is complex and in order to define most phenomena it is necessary for us to reduce them to comprehensible en es that can be processed by the human mind. While this process is necessary to understand them, it also removes context and simplifies the rela onships, that are necessary to fully understand their existence. A full knowledge can only be had when what is known about them is contextualized. The fact is that while we simplify in order to understand something, reality is interconnected, and is always affected and cannot be divorced from context. Systems theory seeks to address complexity by understanding, not just the phenomena in isola on, but how they exist and are affected by other existences. In theory by applying systems theory to the design process, the design solu on proposed in this thesis is more closely based on reality and more accurately addresses problems of social needs. What has been asserted and demonstrated is that, for any solu on to be robust enough to accommodate the complexity of reality, it is necessary for it to be understood in context, through a systemic process. In this thesis, it has been established that the produc on of a work of architecture is a means to sa sfy a set of human needs. Individual needs on their own are complex and it is difficult to understand how they are related and work in a system. This is compounded further when addressing mul ple needs such as social needs, compliments of which have been addressed in this thesis. It is necessary to simplify them in order to understand how they exist and relate to each other in order to find a solu on that can address them appropriately. Architectural paradigms that have relied on deduc ve means of sa sfying needs have produced real solu ons that fall short of theore cal promises, despite the laudable inten ons which spawned the ideas. However, research shows that, to address the complexity of human social need it is necessary to understand how one need is affected by the other, that is to say, the systemic rela onship among them. Applica on of systems theory gives an advantage to the design process, in that it be er mimics the nature of how humans are programmed to sa sfy their needs than does a model of design based solely on an oversimplified deduc ve approach one. Although the complexity of the solu on is closer to reality, it must not be designed in a way that is determinis c. Ul mately, human needs are subjec ve, and each individual addresses them in his or her own way. Such needs can also vary with me, meaning there is no one solu on that can become a blanket solu on for every scenario. Consequently, as the design process becomes more sensi ve

to how humans systemically sa sfy needs, the design begins to resonate more with human ac vity, which can be defined in the context of the thesis as their social behavior. This is because as both theories of need here explored suggest, ac ons are typically mo vated to address mul ple needs, and are seldom focused on addressing one specific need in isola on from others. With regard to the specific focus of the design, namely addressing social needs, the building effec vely creates through its hierarchy of spaces, a configura on akin to a small community. Here, in contrast to a typical high density building, social needs are typically met through the openness of what is essen ally a street condion. While there are issues with privacy, due to limited area sizes, what must be understood is that, as was the original intent of the design, social and privacy needs are addressed as a collec on, and not as separate needs. In a typical building, privacy would clearly be a major issue, but because the spaces are divided in a way that limits traffic into the more private space, generally only those neighbours with whom one is familiar would occupy these spaces, thus allowing social es to make privacy less of an issue ­ and where it is an issue, to be solved by simple means, controlled by the residents themselves. The resul ng spa al rela onship, designed through an understanding of the rela onship between different needs, be er limits the poten al for social isola on in all areas of the building. While strategic planning of social spaces within the building compliments and supports social ac vity, it is also important to ensure that these smaller in mate spaces are equally distributed through the building, to allow all residents easy access to social interac on. Ul mately, it is the people who make the place, so even though one addresses the systemic nature of social needs, reality necessitates that any design, no ma er how thorough, is s ll subject to many more complex variables. Despite the success of pa erns and solu on, they cannot be successfully repeated if they are not sensi ve to differences in context, which include the aims that a design is intended to serve. As a design study, the resul ng thesis project is based on successful pa erns, which were contextualized through the lens of social needs. Simply stated, the process sought to understand how human social needs work and how they can be addressed through pa erns and subsequently shaped into an architectural form. While the thesis in itself does not claim to propose new ideas, it does demonstrate how exis ng ideas can frame an architectural problem in a way that increases the probability of success in crea ng spaces that more intui vely sa sfy human social needs.

THE DESIGN PROCESS
Every design decision whether or not stated within the work was the result of many itera ons which pushed and refined each idea. Near the end of the thesis process the sketches were assembled onto a wall which was eventually organized to tell the story of the story of the past year of work. This "Wall of Complexity" proved very insigh ul in helping clarify and give order to the seemingly chao c spread of paper a ached to the wall. The following pages shows a few sketches that capture several key points in the development of the design project.
