| Abstract |

The ground plane has always been the primary domain of public activities. However, cities developed under the Modernist influence demonstrate an "object-in-space" circumstance with proliferating skyscrappers that fragment the city's ground surface into mid -block spaces and vaguely defined plazas. The demands of motorized-transportation and private enterprise further scatter spaces for pedestrian activities across the plan, section and stratified layers of the city (subterranean or/and elevated networks).The result is an inconsistent public realm that remains from being animated by public vitality. Through the manipulation of the ground-plane, this thesis seeks to remedy such stratification. It posits that a thickening of the ground to create a three-dimensional spatial condition will amplify opportunities for social interaction within otherwise muted civic surfaces. Addressing the contemporary reality of the multiplied ground, this thesis advocates reactivating it as a thickened continuous public domain that dissolves the polarity between the built and social fabric of the city.

I would like to begin by thanking my committee for their support throughout my thesis journey that has allowed me to advance my ideas and positions. I would firstly like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Leila Farah. Her breadth of knowledge on the subject and her critical assessment of my work has helped me refine and structure my thesis. Her unwavering support has allowed me to move from an idea to a complete study. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Director of the Program and my second reader, Prof. John Cirka. His interest and foresight of my thesis has given me the confidence to go beyond my comfort level of design and venture into areas of research that are more challenging. His unsurpassed knowledge has been invaluable in the development of this thesis and he continues to be a source of inspiration. I would also like to thank my program representative, Professor Vincent Hui, who has helped me ground my work by bringing forth pragmatic concerns. A big thank you to all the other professors I had the pleasure of discussing my thesis with, during the course of the year. Their comments and insights have helped me widen my vision. In addition I would like to thank my mentor Prof. Nurur Rahman Khan, for the insightful discussions we had during the inception of my thesis and our librarian, Sonny Banerjee, for his resourcefulness and help with research material. A heartfelt thanks to my dear colleagues who have inspired me to push through deadlines and helped me gather myself when I felt down. Finally I would like to thank my family, in particular my parents, Faizur and Nilufar, and my guardians, Iqbal and Rokeya. Their relentless support and patience is what has made all my achievements a reality. I would especially like to thank my husband, Abrar Karim, for being both my harshest critic and my strongest supporter. I remain indebted for his constant motivation.

1_Interface of the built environment & the public realm

Whether by means of Walter Gropius's slab skyscraper or Le Corbusier's Tower in the Park, Modernism continues to demonstrate its influence on contemporary architecture as it manifests a proliferation of pencil-like towers that race towards the sky. These towers are meant to provide solutions for density and to act as symbols of power as they stand within city cores and dominate urban fabrics. As the Modernist movement altered the strategy of city building from a horizontal growth to a vertical one, it aimed to utilize verticality as means of efficiently accommodating density; its goal was to allow city dwellers to enjoy spaces on the ground plane, at the same time as it facilitated the creation of intricate vehicular pathways. Despite these utopian ideals, however, the actual result has been a formalized landscape characterized by a collection of autonomous built objects that stand like sculptures on beds of infrastructural networks and provide intermittent spaces for pedestrian activities. This development ideology has led to a gradual increase in the fragmentation of the city's ground plane; unstructured areas have been created between towers and vaguely defined common areas have arisen that have as their sole function the accommodation of the iconic towers that stand on them. Although these fragmented open spaces are meant to accommodate the public, their formalized nature tends to generate rigid patterns of use that render them non-adaptable. The fact that they are unresponsive to the dynamic forces exhibited in modern society has led to a lack of multi-dimensionality in urban living environments. Colin Rowe points out in the "Collage City" (1978, 65) that increasing population and escalating urban growth will continue to cause rocketing real estate values. Over time, this situation will render unsustainable the "park" urban space model as imagined by Le Corbusier's Tower in the Park. These spaces would eventually be usurped by private uses, causing a further thinning of the public realm. A growing number of building blocks of intense activity usurp the footprint of the city as density and development continue to rule. Building practices currently offer a compromise by integrating social spaces within building sections and private premises. Often considered as a compensation for additional floors, these "appearing-to-be public" civic spaces remain limited in their use. A lack of civic legibility has arisen from the ongoing opposition between public and private realms and, in addition, the interpretation of internalization of public space further compromises their use. The result has been the creation of inconsistent public realms that are limited in their uses. As densification is increasing, vehicular circulation is also growing, leading to further impacting the street experience as pedestrian are further being moved to peripheral sidewalks and to the stratified layers of the city such as below or above-grade pedestrian networks. There has been a
1   

decline in the social function of the streets and their adjacent gathering spaces that has continued to deanimate parts of the city. While newly created underground and overhead strata are compatible with circulation conditions during the harsher seasons of the year, they have the effect of phasing out street life. Shops found in the underground city networks often fail to capture the vitality of traditional ground-level shops and remain disconnected from the tissue of the city space above. Jane Jacobs (1961, 147) suggests in The Death and Life of Great American Cities that, "When distance and convenience sets in; the small, the various and the personal wither away". Contemporary urban life is being offered as a circumstance where the city's surface is dominated by towering built forms that disregard human scale, with pedestrians relegated to sidewalks that are concentrated in between the intersection of the tower blocks and vehicular circulation, or forced below grade for convenience. The persistent polarization of cities' built and social fabrics, and of their associated public and private realms, has limited their ability to demonstrate a coherent understanding of the public realm and has therefore resulted in its stratification. Overlooking such polarized conditions would continue to isolate places of the city and to shrink the public realm, leading to a greater sense of isolation and objectivity in urban spaces. Jan Gehl (2010, 3) in Cities for People suggests that "For decades the human dimension has been an overlooked and haphazardly addressed urban planning topic, while many other issues, such as accommodating the rocketing rise in car traffic, have come more strongly into focus. In addition, dominant planning ideologies -- modernism in particular -- have specifically put a low priority on public space, pedestrianism and the role of city space as a meeting place for urban dwellers". Reinforcing the importance of public space in our daily lives has become a necessity as current trends demonstrate an increasing privatization of life. Appleyard and Jacobs (1987, 114) in their essay Towards an Urban Design Manifesto comment on how spaces for socialization designed to contribute to the city's public environment are gradually becoming desolate and more and more reliant on formal occasions that transpire mainly in monitored and enclosed spaces. It is acknowledged that there is a pressing need to choreograph opportunities for social interaction in recognizable civic spaces within the city. Henry Shaftoe (2008, 19) suggests that "people only grow by the process of encountering the unknown, and the best place to encounter difference and the unfamiliar is in public spaces, where all segments of society cross paths, mingle and be observed". Human interaction within a city's physical spaces not only allows prospects for social integration but also aids in the spatial experience of the city as a whole. As cities continue to grow exponentially with an ever-increasing urban population, the identity of the city continues to be tied to private-development interests. It is this circumstance that has given rise to the
2   

need for a `new' urban discourse that not only accommodates connectivity, flexibility and adaptability but also facilitates the reshaping of the public realm in a way that will allow for viability in proposed urban environments. With the built fabric continuing to dominate private spaces, the ground plane of the city remains the core denominator of the public domain. Eva Castro and Alfredo Ramirez (2012, 209) in their essay Multiplying the Ground, suggest that "the ground is the last bastion of public space: the territory within the city that needs most urgently to be addressed as it has the political capacity to deeply affect its surroundings." They suggest that the use and manipulation of the ground as raw material entwines it with architecture, and produces structures that support civic functions within the city. Recognizing the contemporary reality of multiple ground planes with below and above-grade networks, this thesis proposes a manipulation of the ground plane that will incorporate a rethinking of underutilized, undifferentiated civic surfaces within city blocks. It proposes revitalization by means of addressing both discontinuities in landscapes and the stratification that persists between public movement and public occupation. It argues that a re-imagining of the interface of the ground plane and of the towering structures it houses has the potential to vitalize the public realm. It can extend the ground to create an activated thickened. This thickening of the ground will offer an extended threshold condition that will mediate between the public-private, indoor-outdoors, built and social fabrics of the city to establish a gradient. It will engage different scales to achieve a substantial spatial resolution that connects the contemporary strata of public movement (at grade, below-grade and above grade), and re-imagine them to facilitate continuation and connectivity instead of segregation. It injects into design proposals the notion of perceiving the ground not only as a single level or datum but as a continuous and growing one that will thicken the public domain even as built forms multiply. This thesis posits that the thickened ground has the ability to tie together the disparate entities found within the urban landscape to create a consistent public realm. Spaces that are dominantly privatized within the urban landscape can be re-organized for public use. The thickening of the public realm aims to re-frame the social experience within the city. This thesis calls for public spaces to be brought to the foreground, allowing it to produce amplified opportunities for social interaction within the city to produce a vibrant and livable environment.

1.1_Figure Ground Relationships_ Stratification on the city's surface Traditionally, the historic form of the city relied on its horizontal expansion. Densification of the built fabric resulted in defined open spaces such as squares where collective activities took place, in close proximity to the private realm. Such historic forms can be seen in many European cities while cities developed with a Modernist influence reflect a completely different scenario. During the1920s, a tide of new thinkers such as Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and Tony Garnier proposed a break-away from the traditional culture of "dead form"; many of their utopian proposals found their way into their professional practice. Proposals such as Le Corbusier's Plan Voisin and Ville Contemporaine for three million inhabitants (1922) introduced the Tower in the Park model that demonstrated a vertical solution to high-density concentration; its ground plane providing open spaces and creating a new image for the city.

Fig 2: Vertical solution to density Plan Voisin, Paris, Le Corbusier, 1925

Le Corbusier's model of vertical living and Walter Gropius's slab skyscrapers started a trend that has flourished up to the contemporary era. Aiming to facilitate the use of the public realm, architecture shifted from a finely grained patchwork of figure related to ground demonstrating contained open spaces (as illustrated on the right of figure 01) towards an open-field approach that presented a cityscape with less structured, leaking open spaces that surrounds the large figural objects, the towers, sitting on them (as illustrated on the left of figure 01). However, over time this model started to face criticism for its perceived lack of identity and for a feeling of disassociation within its voids; the suggestion was that these structures were dehumanizing and did not meet the needs of the residents of the city. Subsequently, several suggestions for altering the figure-ground relationships were made in the hopes of revitalization. Gordon Cullen (1960, 12) in The Concise Townscape identifies that architecture must lay emphasis on the nature of
4   

relationship between such diverse urban elements as buildings, trees, nature, water, traffic, and conceive the city as an integral whole that offers pedestrian an ever-changing environment. A figure-ground relationship featuring a continuous building pochÃ© that created adaptable voids was proposed. Later, in the late 1970s, Colin Rowe in his book Collage City (1961, 58-83) suggested that the Modernist creation of disparate objects on the cityscape was just as problematic as its counterpart, the dense traditional horizontal city of slums that it had set out to remedy. Rowe argued that this model of towering buildings with vast open green park spaces could not be sustained as real estate land values increased over time. Any green space envisioned as being able to support Le Corbusier's Tower in the Park concept, as well as other available residual open spaces, would end up being dedicated to parking lots that would have the effect of detaching buildings from the urban fabric. Rowe advocated for the creation of an urban environment where the figure-ground relationship was balanced between solid and void. However, towers continued to proliferate on the city's ground surface. Designed as solutions to density and as status symbols, they contributed to a landscape of fragmented open spaces and to an inconsistent public domain. The figure-ground configuration of horizontally growing cities became a reality with numerous vertical towers that gradually drained the city of its multi-dimensional livable ground-surface environments. There large scale remained disproportionate to the human scale leading to a disconnect between them and the pedestrian life. Rem Koolhas (1993, 971-975) in his book S, M, L, XL promotes interconnection amongst built architecture as a key tool in producing a more continuous pochÃ© in the figure-ground relationship. He suggests that such interconnectedness would create coherence within increasingly sterile urban contexts that are becoming conglomerates of unrelated objects. Besides presenting Modernist solutions for sculptural objectification of the built form, utopian proposals such as Le Corbusier's Plan Voisin and the Athens Charter of 1933 introduced compartmentalization of programs (Live, work, recreation and circulation) into functional divisions within the city. They thereby eliminated complex and historic multilayered streets and public realms and gave rise to isolated compartmentalized built spaces that did not complement the lived experience of the city. Thom Mayne (2011, 31) in his book Combinatory urbanism: The complex behavior of collective form suggests that compartmentalization of the city's spaces makes both the spaces and city's residents "atomized particles that respond only to themselves and are left to negotiate a world without the connective tissue that weaves individual buildings into a collective." Criticizing this aspect of Modernism, Charles Waldheim (2012, 38) in his essay Landscape as Urbanism comments that Modernism exhibited a "failure to come to terms with the city as an historical construction of collective consciousness" as it brought along with it a certain inability of
5   

accommodating a public realm. In addition to the compartmentalization and objectification of the built form, the figure-ground relationship further extends below and above-ground through the creation of grade pathway networks that drain away much of the street life as it gets relegated to a disconnected elevated level, or is alternately hidden layer below the city. This in turn speaks to the importance of limiting the use of shared urban spaces. This study intends to look into how the different, stratified layers of public spaces both in section and plan can be connected through a consistent homogeneity to revitalize the experience of the city dweller in urban social spaces.

1.2_Transformation in Pedestrian Experience and Urban Morphology of cities_ Stratification in the city's section The development of contemporary cities has undergone a radical transformation. Not only has the focus shifted towards vertical growth, but the social dimension associated with street life has also been impacted as facilitating motorized transport has become paramount in the support of large population densities. Life within cities has traditionally occurred mainly on their surfaces and the mechanisms of their operation took place around blocks and streets. Urban blocks consisted of a pattern of streets and squares. Streets served the parallel purposes of supporting movement and facilitating transport and traffic, at the same time as they offered a platform for informal civic activities for pedestrians. They became venues for commerce and for exchange of information with the possibility of encounters and social interactions. Gathering spaces along the streets made up an important proportion of the public realm; they acted as an interface between the individual and the community, a place for pedestrians to engage in relationships marked by anticipated behavior, coordination and social protocols. While some European towns still reflected this kind of planning, after the 1920s the appearance and character of the streets significantly changed in many cities once the car was introduced. Introduction of motor vehicles and their prioritization radically transformed the way cities developed and operated. Automobiles began to impose an organizational logic that contradicted the street-based tradition of the public realm. The pedestrian experience became relegated to sidewalks and to identifiable intersections. This redefinition of the streets led to a practice whereby the pedestrian and not the cars had to follow restricted patterns of movement. Peter Norton (2002) attests this in his book Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City where he suggests that the new model for streets has led it to become a place for cars instead of pedestrians leading to a notion where it is considered to be the pedestrians fault
6   

if they get hit (210)." With pedestrians relocated from the streets, gathering spaces that gradually grew along them began to disappear. Sidewalks were used for pedestrian traffic and there did not seem to be a necessity for offering supportive spaces or structures for pausing and lingering. In the 1930s Le Corbusier and the delegates of CIAM further advocated the mixing of multiple functions on streets that would impact their primary purpose of conducting vehicle traffic. Their intention was to address the increasing need for housing density by the erection of tall buildings separated by distances and a segregation of cars, pedestrians, and green spaces. However, this isolation began a thinning of the public realm.

In 1963, the UK Ministry of transport commissioned Professor Colin Buchanan and his colleagues to prepare a report for urban and transport planning policy. Known as the Traffic in Town Report (or The Buchanan Report), it became influential in modeling the development of the urban landscape in the UK and other countries over the coming decades. The report concluded that the two existing functions of the streets-- its operation as places for movement and as grounds supporting the performance of civic functions-- were incompatible. It was recommended that these functions should be segregated wherever possible for them to function without hindrance and operate at its full efficiency.
7   

This "anti-street" vision began to deprive the streets and the supporting civic spaces of their multifunctionality and continued to reinforce a conceptual and physical segregation of the urban landscape and the public realm. The city space began to demonstrate two entirely contradictory principles of organization: one was dominated by vehicular traffic and characterized as a regulated, impersonal, consistent singlepurpose systematic medium, and the other was the public realm considered as being culturally nourishing and providing context-based spatial conditions that are unpredictable and are governed by purely social habits. Their intersection however failed to display a gradient which has resulted in the creation of a binary opposition between them. This in turn has led in a diminished pedestrian experience. Critiques of this layout include Jane Jacobs and Jan Gehl.

Figure 05 illustrates the plans for Oxford Street as proposed in the 1963 Buchanan Report, "Traffic in Towns". This posited a less successful model of how the different levels could be separated to avoid overlapping pedestrian and vehicular functions. The vertical levels were intended for shopping and exchange while movement dominated the ground plane. Here we see the inception of stratification of the public realm.
Fig 5: Proposal for Oxford Street, Buchanan Report, 1963

In the beginning of the 1960s, Yona Friedman proposed an urban planning approach that advocated superposition and layering. However, his proposal for a Spatial City demonstrated a segregation of human activities: living, recreation and pedestrian circulation took place on an elevated level while vehicular movement, work and services were allocated to a lower level.

Notions of separation of movement, pedestrian activities and commerce - the zeitgeist of the timebegan to appear in city planning proposals soon after. They tapped into the possibilities of stratification of levels and into the creation of new definitions of what had been called shared spaces. With the Industrial Revolution and much of the technological advancements that came with it, man was equipped with tools and machines that allowed him to manipulate the scale of construction. Massive towering structures became possible, as did the creation of new city strata through utilizing above and below grade levels. Machinery allowed for the extensive excavation necessary to drop a plane below-ground at the same time as it enabled the setting in place of intricate elevated networks. Thus, the multi-layered city was born.

1.2.1_The manifestation of the multi-level city A growing number of infill projects continue to provide extra space for urban development. Densification and expansion simultaneously generate the need for the developments of elaborate infrastructural vehicular networks to facilitate commuting to support the growth. The increasing scale, dominance and complexity of urban life prompts an awareness and appreciation of the pedestrian spaces and realms that are most impacted by the changes. Thus social utopians began to advocate pedestrianization and urged for government policies that would incorporate grade-separated pedestrian systems. These policies were intended to allow for commercially profitable, leasable spaces to flourish and for car-dominated streets to continue uninterrupted. The strategy of the multiplied ground manifests itself in various forms. Multiplied ground in the contemporary city commonly appears as skyways, skywalks, pedways, footbridges, the +15 (elevated walkways), and the subterranean pathway network, also known as the PATH in Toronto. The dawn of the 20th century, marked the beginning of the practice of multi-level urbanism, primarily in the urban centers of North American. While cities like Calgary, Minneapolis and St. Paul, adopted extensive skyways, cities like Montreal and Toronto explored intricate subterranean labyrinths that offered climate-controlled environments for routing pedestrians. Cities like Hong Kong and Japan, with their threedimensional circuits that connect transit stations, shopping malls, office towers, are now emerging as pioneers in demonstrating multi-level urbanism. Traces of grade-separated pedestrian systems can now also be observed in densely populated developing cities. Cities such Mumbai and Dhaka now employ a significant number of pedestrian over-passes that marks manifestations of the multiplied ground.

Multi-level urbanism has its roots in the visions of different social utopians and architectural avantgardes who imagined the creation of multiple levels as a solution to either uninterrupted traffic networks or as means to facilitate a safe and continuous pedestrian environment. In his proposal for urban improvements for Vienna, Otto Wagner advocated the separation of automobile and pedestrian traffic into two levels; this allowed urban life to continue more or less as it had in the pre-industrial era. Similar notions for multilevel urbanism projects were ushered in by proponents such as Le Corbusier, CIAM (the International Congresses of Modern Architecture), Team 10 and Archigram. They all sought to reconcile the growing modernist city with a supporting layered infrastructure that would allow both the pedestrian network and vehicular circulation to operate harmoniously.

10   

A leading proponent of this idea was architect Josep LluÃ­s Sert; he promoted the idea of a threedimensional pedestrian network while emphasizing the importance of its integration with the social structure of the urban core. His intent was to reconcile the Modernist's rational strategies with a socially-activated network. Another proponent, Victor Gruen, proposed some of the first downtown pedestrian zones that operated on similar principles. Gruen, who is known for spearheading the conception of the modern shopping mall, was influenced by his background in retail architecture, as much of his work on multi-level urbanism features retail environments. His view of pedestrian separation was that it provided an opportunity to create more active and socially oriented urban centers. Gruen's proposals for multi-level urban structures incorporated a vocabulary of adaptable components, such as pedestrian bridges, plazas and arcades that could be added and integrated incrementally and evolve over time. As ambitious and pragmatic as his model was, much of the work based on his model took a diluted form. While his proposal sought more socially oriented pedestrian zones, much of its implementation in North American cities tended to undermine the critical aspect of revitalizing the pedestrian experience; instead, they focused more on addressing strategies for traffic management and on creating a unified retail experience to aid the private sector. Another seminal figure who acted as a protagonist of the multi-level city was Vincent Ponte. The planner of Montreal's La Ville Souterraine (1962), the first case of a comprehensive underground pedestrian system implemented at an urban scale, Ponte was, unlike Gruen, driven more by economics than by social and environmental concerns. His work that includes Montreal City Transit and Eaton's Department Stores, reflected his accommodation of the interests of downtown business communities and local developers in the way that it deployed a multilevel pedestrian system. Gruen and Vincent Ponte were both significant forerunners of multi-level urbanism. They laid the foundation for modern skyways and subway systems and proposed innovative typologies for urban design proposals that would be implemented in cities such as Fort Worth, Dallas, and St.Paul.

The growing interest in grade-separated pedestrian systems filtered into the realm of architecture in much the same way as it had into urban design. In the architectural framework, multilevel urbanism emerges in multiple forms that range from superblocks, mega structures, and spatially complex mat buildings, to labyrinths of interiorized urban networks (bridges and connections) within blocks and towers, etc. The manipulation of the multilevel strategy to utilize its potential as a social condenser can be traced in the works of many contemporary architects. For example, Steven Holl in his Linked Hybrid complex (2009), made extensive use of sky bridges that spanned multiple buildings and housed social functions. This project utilized multiple levels to elevate the public beyond the extent of the ground plane.

Fig 14: Linked Hybrid, Steven Holl, 2009

The vision of the multiplied ground allows for a thickening of the street level that can be conceived as a weaving open of the ground plane into alternate levels found above and below grade. The physical construct of the multiplied ground has a significant impact on the perception of space within cities. Jennifer Yoos and Vincent James (2016) in their article The Multilevel Metropolis state that the practice of gradeseparated systems has "radically altered the form and spatial logic of cities around the world". They argue that in spite of their recognition of the need to accommodate the public realm, such systems generate spatial ambiguity because of their stacked physical framework that renders them fully independent urban realms. Although notions of the multiplied ground arose from social utopian philosophies, the fact that they are realized and implemented by pragmatists has led to the mixing of lucrative uses with ones that, while highly profitable, don't contribute to a vibrant public realm. However, given the nature of the quasi-public space that the multi-layered strategy offers, it is clear that public-private developments are the most compatible choice for their implementation. The fact that grade-separated systems allow for concentration of traffic means that they have a positive effect on commercial and real-estate value and therefore attract the

12   

attention of developers. Such systems allow for the acquisition of public right-of-ways through private buildings in return for bonus-density incentives, they have served as catalysts for the development of public networks throughout the city. Although conceived to primarily benefit the pedestrian community, these public network systems are essentially maintained by the private sector. This has often resulted in the fostering of an unwarranted degree of control of collective space by private interests. In addition, it has also been detrimental to the interests of small property owners, having a negative effect on street-level shops and on street life generally. Dave Dillon (1991) in his newspaper article, How Best-Laid Plans of the '60s Helped Create Urban Division, makes the criticism that interiorization of retail spaces off the street generates a social caste system where "downtown streets belong to the poor, the homeless, and the politically disenfranchised and the air-conditioned interior to a homogenous population of office workers." More than often, the aboveand below-grade pedestrian networks created with the multiplied ground concept become segregated levels that remain largely disconnected from the street; this stratification further amplifies discontinuities within the pedestrian landscape. While this thesis explores the sectional logic of the multi-layered approach, it also critiques and attempts to address the stratification often found between layers. It seeks to establish a three-dimensional thickened ground that will re-image the existing nature of its relationship that persists between the parallel levels of subterranean layer, ground and elevated network. The subterranean network that commonly houses transportation hubs and retail will be re-oriented to activities at street level. The aim is to extend the existing network of pedestrian concourses and shopping malls found below ground. The goal is to have them complemented by social spaces such as exterior terraces, public podia, observations decks, and multi-use public spaces that will function as social hubs rather than being mere connecting spaces. The thesis posits that there is a need to extend the use of these transitional points between these stratified layers so that they do more than just create access points. Circulation layers will be constructed to continuously intersect in a way that mediates spatial segregation as well as allows for grade-level public spaces to engage with other levels. This returns to the original vision of the multi-level city as one that emphasises social structure.

1.2.2_Multi-level city in the Canadian Context Canadian cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Calgary demonstrate the implementation of multilevel urbanism in city planning. The post-war policies of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation acted as a catalyst for the growth of colossal international private development corporations; they led to Canadian companies such as Olympia & York and Cadillac becoming some of the largest developers in North America. These private concerns invested in massive development that made implementation of multi-level urbanism a reality. Canada features both an extensive above-grade pedestrian network (+15 elevated walkway in Calgary) and an intricate subterranean pedestrian network (the PATH in Toronto), as well as combinations of both (for example, Edmonton's Pedway). In each case, what began with a few interconnected blocks in downtown cores grew over decades into pedestrianized, multi-level central business districts through planning efforts. Each type offers its own set of advantages as well as introduces challenges. While overhead walkways offer greater visibility than subterranean pedestrian networks, they remain more restrained in their layout and formation as they are guided by structures they build along.

14   

Calgary's +15 Conceived by chief city planner Harold Hanen, the elevated pedestrian network in Calgary got its name, +15, from the height of its footbridges above the street level accommodating the uninterrupted passage of traffic below. Calgary's high-water table precluded the creation of an underground system like Toronto and Montreal. The extensive growth of high-rise, high density towers in Calgary's downtown core significantly facilitated the development of this above-grade network. This comprehensive system incorporates bridges, plazas and climatically controlled walkways to and through buildings. The city has designated an elevated section within its downtown as a "must area" that requires every new construction in the area to connect to it at their own expense. In addition, buildings outside the "must area" are offered the incentive of having additional floor space if they establish a connection to this growing network (Bernstein and Cawker, 1988, 89). All this facilitates an aggregation of the network and allows it to continually expand and evolve. Although guided by building codes, the design efforts in regards to these elevated bridges are generally focused on the form of individual components (as determined by their property owners) rather than being responses to the overall concept of the system. Such self-regulating behavior has led to organic development which has resulted in the creation of chaotic pathways.

Toronto's PATH Network Figure 19 illustrates a vision for an underground pedestrian system for downtown Toronto that was developed in 1963. The development of an underground pathway in Toronto began in 1900 when the Timothy Eaton department store created tunnels that connected branches to its main store at 178 Yonge St. and to its bargain annex. These underground connections facilitated an ease of movement for

appreciated during harsh weather conditions. Five tunnels were developed within the downtown core by 1917. In 1927, an underground tunnel was built to connect the Royal York Hotel (now known as the Fairmont Royal York) to the newly opened Union Station. The Yonge Subway line that spanned from Union Station to

15   

Eglinton Station created an extension of this network in 1954. It continued to grow in 1963 with the addition of a subway loop that connected University Avenue to St George Station. The development picked up significant momentum in 1967 when Mies van der Rohe completed the Toronto Dominion Center block of office towers in the financial district. What started as a post office transformed into a full shopping arcade that attempted to function as an underground city within a city; it offered services, restaurants, stores, and a movie theatre (Goodman, 1984). Between 1973 and 1984, the network within the financial district grew to include the Richmond Adelaide Centre (RAC), Commerce Court, First Canadian Place (FCP) and the Eaton Centre. Since each of these segments of the Path was managed by its respective land owners (approximately thirty five corporations), the network underwent branding in the 1993 to create an integrated and cohesive wayfinding system. The network further expanded to incorporate public and cultural destinations such as the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC), Metro Hall, the CN Tower, the Rogers Centre, the Air Canada Centre (ACC), etc. In 2009, a direct route from Union Station to the Eaton Centre was opened. In 2014, the PATH map extended to include the underground spaces of the MaRS Discovery District at College and University Avenue, and it is anticipated that in the future it will continue to grow. While the PATH exhibits the largest underground shopping complex in the world, it remains significantly stratified and isolated from the city space and therefore contributes little in terms of its engagement with the street level.

1.2.3_Impact of the PATH Network The Path network offers a vertical separation of vehicles and pedestrians and endorses a solution to congestion that the proponents of the modernist ideology sought. However, along with its merits, the path faced the alienating aspects of being subterranean. Inspite of its attempts to mimic the vibrancy of the street life with its underground storefronts, the lack of a sense of place fails to engage the users to linger and socialize within the space. Lack of visually and physically significant connections to the city space above caters an impediment to spatial orientation and visual connectivity to the urban landmarks limiting any reference point to those who circulate. Although the PATH extends the city's network of movement and has become an indispensable part of the daily routine of Toronto's commuter population, it continues to drain out life within the city, segregating the public realm into isolated sections within the city. Following the increasing pedestrian activity underground, much of the retail activity found on the streets, with its variety of storefront, are gradually being pushed down. This creates a void on the ground plane that primarily become set back spaces to compliment the iconic towers that sit on them. The appeal of downtown to pedestrians is essential in making the area more attractive and competitive. However, such practice of separating pedestrian movement within the stratified levels without establishing a continuity is leading to the creation of dull streets and a core devoid of activity.

Although there are some distinct benefits to having stratified micro-climates for pedestrians that allow a comfortable environment during harsher weather, the lack of visibility and it's urban disconnect cannot be ignored. With social functions such as gathering, lingering and informal encounters gradually disappearing from the surface of the city, the sidewalks and the PATH network have become conveyor belts that lead people from one destination to the next. As a comparison of this condition, the Eaton Center in Toronto and the Galleria in Milan can be used as examples. The Eaton Centre was inspired by the Galleria in Milan as a model for mimicking the internalized street experience. The Galleria offers a continuation of the city fabric along with street functions and features such as retail and transition spaces, awnings and shaded areas within a covered pedestrian passage. However, while the Eaton Centre attempts to mimic its environment, it fails to achieve the same effect since it is very inward- orientated and doesn't give one a sense of being within the city space. In addition, while the Galleria in Milan remains at grade, the Eaton Centre attempts to manipulate a variation of levels. In a rather similar approach, the PATH network attempts to mimic street life at grade but because of its inward orientation remains segregated from the city space. Recently, to reestablish an interface with the city space outside, the Eaton Centre is undergoing renovations at its perimeter to create more outward-facing conditions. It is paramount to re-orient intersections with the underground pedestrian network in order to create spatial coherence and a vibrant public realm.

This thesis posits that there must be more emphasis on the social framework of the city in the construction of the urban landscape. When vertical intensification of the built space in the city core is not significantly matched by the thickening of the public layer, the public realm is compromised. The ground plane has been and continues to be the base condition for urban activity; however, the architecture of the city has to accommodate the contemporary reality of multiple layers of movement within it. This study explores how
18   

architecture can begin to re-imagine the ground condition and revitalize the pedestrian experience on and beyond it. The proposal aims to the extend the public realm through the creation of plazas and mid-block spaces to provide shared areas between the public and private realms while allowing them to interweave the stratified layers of the city such as the underground PATH network in Toronto.

1.3_Polarity between the built and social fabric of the city_ Stratification by the built-form The proliferation of autonomous pencil-like towers continues to fragment the city's surface into isolated sections; as well, the scale of their construction tends to disregard the human scale related to pedestrians, as buildings interface with the ground plane. This leads to a failure to provide spatial conditions at the ground level that would support a pedestrian-friendly environment. Thus, the open-field conditions innate in this type of urban development may not be appropriately activated. Besides its response to the human scale, the threshold conditions of these built forms are marked by a distinct separation of outdoor open spaces from indoor programmed environments. This impedes a fluid transitioning between the two environments, leading to a heightened awareness of the opposition between the realms of the public and private, the built and the social fabric. The densification of the urban fabric coupled with the pressure of commercialization and privatization has led to design policies that accommodate a meta-morphed form of public spaces that are privately owned or operated by public-private concerns. Studies point out that these spaces operate at two levels. They are either created or maintained by private corporations based on an agreement with the government in exchange for additional benefits, or they exist as public-private partnerships that were created by governmental entities and later transferred to private management/ownership. Jerald Kayden coined the term "Privately Owned" and said that it refers to the legal status of the land; "Public Space" is not necessarily public property like a city park, a neighborhood library, street or sidewalk. In this context, it can refer to a physical space located on private property to which the owner has granted legally binding rights of access and use to the members to of the public, most often in return for something of value from the city to the owner. Extent is defined by the city's zoning regulations and by legal action. Privately owned and privately managed public spaces have been created by private corporations and institutions in response to the government's intention to increase light and air on the streets and to improve the quality of urban environment. In 1961 the first zoning reform was completed. New zoning regulations introduced a bonus incentive as a "trade-off" to encourage private developers to provide public spaces on their private property in exchange for receiving
19   

FAR bonuses, with up to 20% of the base- authorized FAR associated with their properties. Section 37 of the Planning Act for Ontario authorizes a municipality with appropriate Official Plan provisions to pass zoning bylaws involving increases in the height or density otherwise not permitted by the Zoning By-law, in return for the provision by the owner of community benefits (Gary Wright, 2002). Lever House (1952) and the Seagrams Building (1958) became models for such practices. While such policies attempt to cater to the creation of public spaces in conjunction with the multiplication of private developments, the formalized appearance and controlled nature of these "meant-tobe-public" spaces within private premises and internalized building sections generates stratification even when they were conceived of as social spaces to be used by the collective. The lack of gradient between city spaces as they move from the public to the private domains and the mutating nature of contemporary public spaces contribute to a limited civic legibility that impacts the vitality of these spaces. The presence of successful public spaces within the city is vital for a self-sustaining social structure. To create more successful urban cores, a variety of public spaces operating at various scales and offering flexible activities, usage, comfort, access and linkage is necessary to enable sociability and enjoyable motion through cityscapes. Buildings should not just be designed as space occupiers for specific programs but should also define space in a way that not only demonstrates an allowance for continuity of the urban texture but also provides a desirable environment for people to gather and congregate. Henry Shaftoe (2008, 141) suggests that "people seem to enjoy a sense of enclosure without feeling claustrophobic. Huge structures- whether they be walls or buildings- and vast open spaces may be aweinspiring, but they are unlikely to facilitate a feeling of conviviality". This reflects the current phenomenon faced within the urban core. Thus in order to create physical conditions that encourage participation by the public, there needs to be a hierarchy in the spatial conditions created by the built environment. Such physical settings need to be complemented by a strong sense of civic legibility that allows potential users to read them as spaces that they can appropriate and use. Civic legibility through contiguous and continuous spatial opportunities can foster moments of pause or catalyze engagement. These "pause moments" are intended to reconnect city dwellers to designed spaces, and to contribute to an atmosphere that enriches the daily experience of the city. Through an identification of the challenges of the contemporary "appearing-to-be" public spaces, this thesis states that public spaces in today's urban societies must be redefined and brought to the forefront to form a thickened ground condition that constantly reconnects and amplifies the pedestrian experience. This multi-layered network of public spaces will encompass architectural structures, connective
20   

walkways (below, on and above ground), and sidewalks to open spaces that exist in surrounding neighbourhoods. This woven mesh will function as a single entity that aims to offer a consistent public legibility, unifying the public realm and the public parts of the private realm. The resultant dynamic, threedimensional spatial datum for the public will address civic visions in the context of contemporary urban reality. Architecture needs to provide the framework for the manifestations of events rather than just offering defined forms of occupation.

1.4_Conext and Mies Van der Rohe_ Stratification generated by the culture of development on site An ideal context within Canada that demonstrates each of the discussed nature of stratification, both in plan and in section, is the Financial District of Toronto. It was therefore selected as an area for further exploration. A site within it was then chosen to test the hypothesis. Toronto's Financial District is located in the heart of the downtown and is connected by public transit that includes both regional and local networks. It is at close proximity to major arteries and highways, making it one of the most accessible locations within the city. Besides housing some of the largest banks, service companies, management firms, stock exchanges, and heritage sites, the Central Business District of Toronto demonstrates increasing growth of the high-rise residential facilities dispersed around its precinct. According to TD Economics (2013), the population growth in Toronto's downtown core increased by 16.2% between the years 2006 and 2011.Thus the need for public facilities increased simultaneously.
Fig 24: The public realm components of the financial district

21   

Toronto's Financial District exhibits some of the most iconic architectural assets of the country, making it a tourist attraction. However, it does not significantly incorporate the public realm and therefore it fails to offer a meaningful experience.
Fig 25: Zoning of the financial district

The fact that the Financial District allows for unrestricted building height, its high-rise towers continue to establish a disconnect between the built form and the human scale. This, in turn, impacts the pedestrian experience at grade. In addition, erratic development has fragmented areas within the district into poor midblock spaces. The Financial District also offers an extensive 30-km underground pedestrian network supplemented by an elaborate chain of shopping areas. Public spaces are thus offered in fragments within the urban core. Demonstrating dense occupation during its peak hours, the vitality of the Toronto Central Business District begins to drain out after office hours. This isolation becomes even more pronounced during weekends when the streets and their adjacent open spaces become devoid of activities and therefore users. It is to a large extent the result of an anti-city approach characterized by segregation of work, live, play. Because its single identity is that of office functions, it caters to a very specific demographic of people-the office goers. People outside this category may find it unwelcoming. The upshot of this is that life drains out of the city center and the diversity needed for the public realm to survive is discouraged. Public life in Toronto's Financial District is therefore decreasing. The fact that it has one purpose only--to provide office space--means that public participation is not consistent in the space and therefore it is underutilized, even with some of the carefully manicured plaza conditions it offers. A report by the Toronto Financial District BIA (Business Improvement Area) in 2013 suggested that about 200,000 people filter into the office towers, streets and plaza of the Financial District every day. At the end of each business day, however, the vast majority of them leave. The awareness of the lack of supporting social structures within the area has instigated several government initiatives. For example, the Toronto Financial District Business Improvement Area Plan documents poor social conditions within the Financial District and advocates improvements of the public realm through urban design guidelines to create a street-level experience on par with the beautiful designs and monumental architecture in the area. Their 2013 report highlights that

22   

"Despite these [City of Toronto] polices for supporting the City's downtown, public infrastructure in the Financial District is in generally poor condition, especially in comparison to the privately owned property in the area. Recognizing the importance of the Financial District as an economic generator for the City of Toronto, it is paramount that the City invest in improving operations and the quality of the public realm in its premier business centre"
-Toronto Financial District BIA, 2013  

Much of the business character that identifies the Financial District today gradually developed during the 19th century when it was the "New Town" extension of York. A few decades ago, the area offered a rather different social environment. King Street, which is one of the primary arteries of the city, runs through the heart of the financial district. Tracing the evolution of King Street over the last few decades is instructive in recognizing the nature of development that has led to diminishing social participation within the area.

1.4.1_Evolution in the built fabric and character of King Street In the early 1800s, King Street consisted of a row of buildings from Jarvis Street to Bay with some fragmented development between Bay and Simcoe Streets. It had already established a distinct identity as a commercial axis that also featured some public buildings. By the mid-1800s, the area became lined by high-volume retail stores with a number of the blocks reserved for the development of prominent public buildings such as a courthouse, market, hospital and church. This gave it strong potential to be defined as the civic core of the city (Westfall, MacDowell and Hall, 1988, 174-175). While many public buildings had been constructed as planned, a significant growth in business led to gradual change. King Street began to grow more specialized with street frontages lined by branded retail shops with a few office structures sprinkled along it. It began to exemplify Toronto's growing economic importance. While the south identified more as a wholesale district, the north began to emerge as a hub for office structures including offices for stockbrokers, coal merchants, real estate agents, newspapers, etc. (Westfalll et al. 1988, 178). This period also marked some dramatic transformation in terms of appearance as plain Georgian brick facades were replaced by ornate Victorian structures. The new buildings being developed were also larger and higher than the Georgian rows. The dawn of the late 1800s saw significant developments west of Bay as new structures rose alongside

23   

old ones. The combination of old and new offered a varied architectural expression that ranged from oneand two storey wooden buildings to five-storey brick towers; the overall result was an extremely lively streetscape. Between 1850 and 1881, the built fabric that developed along King Street accommodated programs such as retailing, manufacturing, printing firms, important newspapers such as the Globe and Mail, the Telegram and the World; stationery companies, stores, hotel-restaurant combinations, general commercial buildings, residential buildings and even some residences over the shops (Westfall et al. 1988, 182). Thus in spite of being a commercial nexus, it still exhibited a diversity of programs. The most important use of land and building on King Street till the early 1880's continued to be retail, whose visibility on the ground level shaped the street and its public image. During that time, Yonge Street facades around Queen were developing in a similar fashion. As real estate values increased in accordance with King Street's popularity as a specialized commercial hub, the residential presence began to gradually disappear. At the same time, the introduction of new transit lines led to a more specialized and efficient transportation system. Between 1881 and 1914, about three-quarters of the frontage on King Street-- between Church to west of Bay-- was redeveloped with major retails stores and a significant number of buildings that included some of the largest banks of Toronto like the Canadian Bank of Commerce (Westfall et al. 1988, 186). While retail facilities still had a foothold on King Street, they were noticeably declining in number as offices began to predominate. Public buildings on site also began to disappear. The Great Fire of 1904 that had destroyed most of the area catalyzed a massive rebuilding campaign that allowed for significant physical transformation of King Street as a new building scale was introduced. The proportions offered as streets frontages began to alter as buildings much taller than before were being constructed, especially west of Bay. Prominent banks, law firms, the Toronto Stock Exchange, mortgage and insurance companies-- including the Dominion Bank, the Bank of Toronto, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Scotland Mortgage Company, and the Canada Life Assurance began to build their head offices there (Westfall et al. 1988, 189). Within the span of a few years, King Street became the core of an office canyon. While this allowed King Street to emerge in national importance, it began to considerably lose its local significance. The declining retail activity on King Street and its increase on Yonge Street resulted in a pedestrian depopulation of the street. Eventually printing and manufacturing plants also relocated away from the King-Bay intersection. The social events that had once taken place on King Street began to transpire at the junction of Queen and Bay Streets with the opening of the New City Hall in 1898. The impact of office structures influenced the street life on King; it now had a reduced and less diverse crowd while Queen and Yonge featured pedestrian-friendly activities and diverse street frontages.
24   

As street life continued to pale on King Street, opulent banking halls with opaque windows came to be the norm. With the scale of business increasing within the area, the next few decades saw massive corporate redevelopments on the far west with taller buildings housing larger corporations. In particular, the King-Bay intersection underwent radical transformations. The construction of the Toronto-Dominion Centre in 1967 was perhaps the most dramatic addition as it profoundly influenced the future development of the area. Located at the south-west corner of King and Bay Streets (once referred to as the MINT corner because the head offices of the four chartered banks- Montreal, Canadian Imperial, Nova Scotia and Toronto Dominionwere located there), the Toronto Dominion Centre assigned distinct architectural forms to private and public interests. The TD towers were a radical departure from tradition in both scale and in style. While surrounding structures at the time featured arched windows and gargoyles, Greek columns and bronze roofs, the design of the TD Centre flaunted simplicity. Eventually it revolutionised the perceptions of the built environment. The redevelopment along King Street continued this trajectory with each tower rising up higher than its predecessor. The succession of iconic symbols of power, however, overwhelmed any expression of the quality of publicness that is essential to a vibrant city environment.

1.4.2_Influence of Mies Van Der Rohe and the Toronto Dominion Centre The Toronto Dominion Centre project was commissioned by Allen Lambert, former President and Chairman of the Board of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. He persuaded the TD board that the bank should go into partnership with Fairview Corporation (now The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited) to create a new headquarters to replace The Bank of Toronto building, a Beaux Arts-style building designed in 1913 by Carrere & Hastings and situated on the south-west corner of King and Bay. In order to realize this vision, they assembled almost the entire city block that was bounded by York, King, Bay and Wellington Streets. In addition to The Bank of Toronto, the block contained another significant building, the Toronto Stock Exchange Building that edged Bay Street. To execute this massive redevelopment project, TD Bank and Fairview decided to retain an internationally acclaimed designer. They commissioned Mies van der Rohe as design consultant with John B. Parkin and Associates, Bregman + Hamann, and the Fairview Corporation as developers. The original program for the Center called for 288,000 m2 of office and banking space, with 14,300 m2 being dedicated to the creation of shops, restaurants, a cinema and underground parking facility (Lambert, 2001, 419). For Mies, the project offered him the opportunity to test his urban conception within the confines of a large city block. The layout of downtown Toronto had previously evinced little thought for open spaces and had not provided focal points of public interest. Mies wanted to demonstrate a significant change in conception by liberating the ground level from distracting urban functions and freeing it to be at the disposal of pedestrians. He imagined the city as a single large contiguous square that could be used in a variety of ways and through which anyone could move at will. He wanted structures that would be conducive to strolling on the boulevard and that would offer colonnaded porticos, rest areas, zones planted with trees and accessible lobby spaces, with all of these being brought together on a publically accessible urban surface. His intention was to create an urban situation that offered the flexibility of an urban square and that had inherent in it unlimited potential for activities that would serve individual needs without imposing any restrictions (Ungers, 2002, 110-131). To achieve his vision, he composed the Toronto-Dominion Tower block. It comprised three structures of various scales; regulated in three dimensions, they were organized on a granite plinth following a geometrically ordered grid of 1.5m2.The three original structures designed by Mies include a low banking pavilion anchoring the site at the corner of King and Bay Streets that was completed in 1968; the main tower; the 56-storey TD Bank tower located at 66 Wellington Street West completed in 1967; and the 46-storey Royal Trust Tower located on the northwest corner at 77 King Street West, completed in 1969. Each of these
26   

buildings were carefully offset from adjacent ones: one bay of the governing grid could be slid open or closed as an observer traveled across the court. The rectilinear pattern of the granite pavers follows the grid, thereby organizing and unifying the complex. In addition, the plaza's surface material extends through to the glass lobbies of the towers and the banking pavilion with the intention of blurring the distinction between interior and exterior space. The placement of the three structures creates two voids between the buildings: one in the form of a formal plaza to the north, and another as an expanse of lawn to the south; the latter offers a green respite and also features Joe Fafard's sculpture "The Pasture". Mies' conception introduced perhaps one of the first examples of large-scale public outdoor spaces to Toronto's urban core; they remain some of the largest within the financial district. In terms of the architecture, the project stands as a prominent example of the International Style in Canada. Just as Doric temples present essentially the same architectural character, Mies' buildings of the fifties and sixties inspire a similar reading and differ only in the subtlest of ways. They are all distinct in that they adopt the same proportions and spatial relationships. The material palette of his designs is identifiable through all his projects with slight variations being based on responses to its programmatic content.

27   

The TD Centre demonstrates the structural and architectural ideas that he had been maturing over decades. It bears a strong resemblance to his design for the Seagram Building (1955-1958) in New York, while his Chicago Federal Centre of 1974 replicates its model. The Seagram Building was considered as an ideal model of privately owned public spaces. The concept Mies based it on was further tested and crystallized with the Toronto-Dominion Centre project. The pavilion also bears a resemblance to Berlin's New National Gallery by Mies, except that the Gallery has a vast overhanging roof line. While the TD towers are larger than those of the Seagram Building, they follow the same theme: all are darkly coloured, rigidly ordered steel and glass edifices on a ceremonial open plaza, created within a dense, erratic pre-existing urban fabric. Contrary to the initial plan that called for the TD Centre to be the largest concrete building in the British Commonwealth of the time, Mies' proposal was a rectilinear, well-proportioned glass and steel structure that comprised of a structural steel core with reinforced concrete flooring. The facades are distinguished by visual openness: the bronze-colored tinted glass stretching from the top of the lobby all the way to the roof is articulated only with exposed, matte black-painted steel I-beams. The I-beams that attach on the outside of the mullions and structural columns perform both structural and aesthetic functions. The typical window module is 1.5m x 2.7m (5'-0" x 9'-0") (Ontario Heritage Foundation, 2005). The whole structure touches the ground only at the columns and the core provides a spacious ground-level base with sheets of plate glass; revolving glass doors welcome one into a travertine-walled elevator lobby. The double-height lobby is held back from the exterior column line to create an overhang around the perimeter of the building that offers a shady pedestrian refuge. Mies' proposal furthered the vision for the towers to operate as separate entities at the same time as they allowed for an interlinked public space which he believed responded constantly to the scale of the individual as well as to city traffic and pedestrians. Another revolutionary contribution the TD Centre was the creation of an extensive underground concourse level. In his attempt to create a clutter-free and flexible open space within the city, Mies pushed all retail activity underground, right above the parking level. The project re-introduced much of the retail character that the area had exhibited in yester-years even as it morphed into an underground space with a continuous climatically controlled environment. Its activities remain invisible to the street-scape and therefore it doesn't contribute to the vitality of the streets above. Small access points parallel to the street connect the two grades of pedestrian movement. In this way, Mies subtly defined his stance on the reduction of elements. Later, even as a few more structures were added to the complex, an effort was made to retain the open environment that Mies had intended. These structures included the 32- storey West Tower (formerly known as the Canadian Pacific Tower and Commercial Union Tower) completed in 1974 by Bregman +
28   

Hamann Architects and situated along Wellington Street. The old Toronto Stock Exchange building was later incorporated and converted into the Design Exchange building, with a 31-storey tower that is accessible from Bay Street or from inside the complex. This tower was completed in 1991 by Bregman + Hamann Architects and Scott Tan de Bibiana and is now known as the Ernst and Young building. Two other towers, a 39-storey high TD Waterhouse Tower (formerly the IBM Tower) also completed by Bregman + Hamann Architects in 1985 and a 22-storey tower designed and completed by Pellow + Associates Architects Inc. are also considered part of the TD complex even though they are located on the south side of Wellington Street West (TD Centre Website).

It was, however, the Miesian development of the Toronto block that ushered in a new wave of architectural regeneration within the area. With the completion of the Toronto-Dominion Center just five blocks north of the shore of Lake Ontario and three blocks south of a well-known City Hall, Mies accomplished a flexible open plaza in the midst of a dense and erratic pre-existing fabric. Through his simple yet elegant towers, Mies redefined the skyline of Toronto's cityscape. His influential landmark also fuelled the appetite for Modernist architecture in Toronto's post-war construction boom. The influence of Mies's TD towers can be witnessed in many other skyscrapers developed afterwards.

Mies instigated a new sense of urban form that led to a new wave of developments. Not only did the construction of the Toronto-Dominion Center encourage a number of other banks to build their head offices within the area, it also inspired projects to attempt to incorporate open spaces and significant set-backs. These allowed breathing spaces to be created on sites; in many cases, structures were distant from the street and were accompanied by vaguely defined mid-block and plaza spaces that were not as successful as their predecessor, the Toronto Dominion Centre. With the introduction of each office complex in the area, smaller businesses continued to fade out, making the land-use pattern more homogenous, and street life paler. An increasing number of complexes on site followed Mies' lead and offered retail below ground that connected to the network he had established. This made shops at grade a rarity and the importance of King Street as a public thoroughfare continued to decline with pedestrian occupation predominantly consisting of commuters who scurried into and out of buildings during peak office hours and lunch breaks. On weekends, street life is further drained. The lack of diversity at grade led to lifeless streets with sterile manicured plazas that attempted to humanize themselves with pieces of sculpture. In the attempt to balance demands of public and private use of land, private interests largely predominated. While the staggering increase in the size of buildings created a national image, civic identity suffered a significant blow as newly created social barriers prevented a shared interest in the street and produced a dull and de-animated core. This thesis observes that while Mies' TD proposal offers a significantly large landscaped open space for pedestrians, it lacks visible activity on the level below. The only opportunity for that to happen on the site has been neatly tucked below the ground and disconnected from the city space to set the stage for beautiful Miesian towers. The thesis concludes a more intimate hierarchy of spaces must be created that maintains required social distance and revitalizes the existing open spaces. A node environment must be created that bears the characteristics of a square not only in terms of openness but also in terms of activities. It further observes that a significant number of sites within the financial district exhibit sidewalks and sterile public spaces that stand empty; uncomfortably squeezed between tall towers; they are unable to sustain long-term human activity. To address this condition and to mediate the disconnect between the day and night persona of the Financial District, greater attention needs to be paid to how these public spaces are layered, programmed and oriented within tower conditions. In addition, there must be an acknowledgement that significant visibility and flow between the underground strata of public activity can encourage a diverse and vibrant city life. Mies in his designs always leaned towards the creation of stable, flexible structures that were
30   

capable of responding to change and evolution. The TD Tower block serves as an ideal site to re-imagine and redefine the public realm through a connected network of spaces and activities. Just as Mies' project had been a catalyst in the development of new urban forms, the proposal for the intervention is expected to stimulate a similar interest in the creation of a revitalized public domain that would retain its past character while offering greater opportunity for a more consistent social density. This thesis recalls William H. Whyte (2002, 104) who critiqued the current nature of developments by stating that "Everybody, it would seem, is for the rebuilding of our cities...with a unity of approach that is remarkable...But this is not the same as liking cities...Most of the rebuilding underway, is being designed by people who don't like cities. They do not merely dislike the noise and the dirt and the congestion, they dislike the city's variety and concentration, its tension, its hustle and bustle...the results are not cities within cities, but anti-cities."

2.0_Remedying the stratification between the built environment and the public domain The increasing de-animation of areas within the city core has results in a compromised public realm; persistent inconsistencies and stratifications found in the city arising from the isolated operations of independent layers and from a disregard for human experience where it intersects with the built environment. Continued disregard for such stratification would lead to the isolation of these spaces from the social environment of the cities. In order to revive the public-ness of such areas, architecture must re-engage itself in the blurring of polarities. It must operate as a social device that creates simultaneity between public spaces in the city and the built environment. Thus an attempt needs to be made to conceive an urban public network that operates at different scales and with different sequences. Since perception of space, interior or exterior, public or private, built or un-built, primarily depends on sensual reactions to movement and transitions, any reshaping of the public realm has to be initiated from the extension of current pedestrian traffic. Creation of multi-layered public space networks need to recognize underground pathway networks as extensions of the city. These networks require significant reconsideration to be reconnected to, and re-associated with, activities at grade. An elevated platform will further recognize the contemporary pedestrian network as a three-dimensional reality beyond just being a hidden underground network. To be considered as wholes, networks needs to be linked through public platforms with appealing at-grade public amenities that are conducive to a desire for further exploration. Creating provisions for these multiple layers of circulation to intersect will offer opportunities to bring separate entities together, eliminating segregation of activities within the city. It will also create possibilities for keeping at-grade public spaces continuously engaged, visually and physically. When integrated through a network of both formal and informal social spaces and activity areas, these systems will be able to create a unique architecture consisting of voids, liminal transitions and extended threshold conditions that inject public vitality through the linking of its constituent parts. Fusion between internal programs and external events created through a habitable thickened ground and faÃ§ades would begin to blur existing stratification and instigate a dynamic multi-sensory experience that could positively alter the user's pattern of occupation and interaction. The intent to create such a contiguous and continuous public realm in sections can take significant inspiration from Nolli Plan's conception and representation of public spaces as a continuous entity that permeates into interiors of buildings. Such notions of an extended pedestrian public space that expands beyond just streets and continues along and within the built form needs to be incorporated in the conception of contemporary urban architecture.

32   

2.1_Nolli's Map_ Reiteration in Contemporary Practice The perception of a continuous public realm can be identified in Italian architect and surveyor Giambattista Nolli's Pianta Grande di Roma. Completed in 1748, Nolli's map stands as one of most influential historical documents of its time. It is still considered to be one of the best representations of the city. This plan of the city of Rome that was created as a composition of 12 exquisitely engraved copper plates measuring approximately 176cm by 208 cm; it includes about eight square miles of the surrounding terrain and the densely built city (Tracing Architecture, Dana Arnold, 2003). Nolli's map was the first attempt to reorient the city to the magnetic north rather than to the east, which was the convention at the time. However, what is most interesting is how the map not only made a record of its streets, squares and urban spaces but also presented detailed plans of building interiors. In a homogenous interpretation, it denoted spaces open to the public both within and outside buildings. It adopted the figure-ground representation that renders solids as dark grey (with hatch marks) and uses white or light-grey to denote voids. While most approaches considered the city as an open canvas to be filled with figural built forms, the map conceived the city as a mass that had parts "carved" away to create "outdoor" rooms. This allowed for the notion that buildings are not isolated events within a single context, but are deeply embedded in the fabric of the city that gives them life and meaning. The fact that the figure-ground portrays public spaces within the buildings as white pochÃ© just like city streets and open spaces means that these can be considered as extensions of city space. A sense of civic legibility is created that allows for the notion of these spaces being available to all. The Nolli Map is known for its powerful presentation of the city as a continuous accessible space where the outside and inside interlock. The plan represents a continuous whole; as such, it helps decipher the patterns and relationships between private and public buildings. Thus the city, along with its designated civic spaces, can be seen as a shared organism that allows its users a strong sense of place. It also functions as a demonstration that a great deal of what we would call `interior space' was available to the citizens of the Eighteenth Century. This map highlights that context has the ability to condition buildings, and that buildings in turn have the scope to create outward pressure on the city fabric. The representational approach of the map allows for the understanding that the formal and spatial structures of cities are not necessarily static but, rather, constitute a dynamic, highly activated realm that is impacted by the competing pressure of the surroundings at both at the urban and human scales. There is facilitated a dynamic interplay between what appears to be solid and void, between figure and ground, and between old and new (The Nolli Map and Urban Theory, James Tice, 2005).

33   

Fig 37: Nolli Map of Rome

Fig 38: Sectional Blow up of Nolli Map, 1748

The only criticism that this thesis makes about the Nolli Map is that there is a sharp and distinct delineation between the two types of spaces-- built and open-public and private-- rather than a presentation of any transitioning gradient between them. Nolli's Plan is significant to this thesis in that it presents public spaces as figural elements in the city, with surrounding buildings representing the field or ground; this is a reversal of the notion of the idolization of buildings as active figural objects (such as the tower in the plaza) that relegate public spaces to background. Modernist practices that arise from the celebration of built forms as objects negate the possibility of celebrating public urban spaces. With its increasing vertical distribution and insertion into private building premises, the public realm tends to get fragmented and disconnected as disparate elements scattered on the city surface and within building premises, thus losing their eligibility to qualify as city spaces. Fragments of public spaces remain isolated as artifacts within building sections and building blocks, becoming just as disconnected as the sculptural buildings themselves. The contemporary reality of cities exhibits a distribution of public space through the sections of the city; this gives birth to an underground and overhead condition that further fragments continuity of civic spaces within the city. This study explores approaches that can be adopted to offer a more coherent understanding of the public realm, one that is not limited in terms of its legibility. It will reiterate the principles of sections of Nolli's map to regain a sense of continued legibility of the public realm that will encompasses all its strata: underground, at grade and above-ground. It aims to link urban spaces into a continuous whole as it amplifies the presence of public spaces. The Nolli's map will be used as a reference point that provides precedents for the presentation of continuous public urban spaces through architecture. Such an approach would rely heavily on the interweaving between landscape, architecture and tread into impacting urban planning.

2.2_The Five Levels of Public Activity In the report to the City of Toronto Planning Board called "On Building Downtown-Design guidelines for the Core Area", George Baird et al (1974, 17), wrote about guidelines which consider the vertical section of buildings in the core area in terms of five levels of public activity which comprise of the following: " (1) Below-ground: The level which is familiar as the one at which indoor shopping concourses exist, such as the concourse level of the Commerce Court, or now what has become widely known as the PATH. (2) Ground Level: With its historic tradition as the primary level of public activity, the ground level needs to retain and strengthen the quality of public life. It has been suggested that below-ground and aboveground levels of public walkways should be introduced as complements to the vital ground level, rather than to present competition to it. (3) Above-Ground: This again is familiar as one that hosts shopping concourses (such as the Colonnade) and pedestrian walkways (such as the one around Nathan Philip Square). (4) Low Roof: Many buildings in the downtown core now include low roofs which provide, or could provide, areas for public activity. (Roof for podiums, for example). (5) High roof Level: This level is already familiar from examples existing in Toronto such as the Park Plaza Roof Terrace (an outdoor terrace nearly 30 floors up in the air) and the Commerce Court Observation Gallery (an enclosed roof on the top of 50th floor). " -George Baird et al (1974, 17)

Fig 40: Five Levels of Public Activity, On Building Downtown, 1974

Their proposal encourages contemporary design to constantly inspire the creation of these five levels simultaneously as density of the urban core increases. The accommodation of these five levels for public activity would ensure a thickening of the public realm that is simultaneous with the intensification of the built fabric. Although many of these layers already exist, their conception, construction and maintenance tends to lack continuity with the city space; this in turn limits their civic legibility, leading them to become fragmented and desolate. Through a homogenous presentation, they can stay connected at the same time as they offer a desirable environment for people who want to pause, linger or explore. This makes relevant the adoption of the Nolli's map in section and the creation of a thickened ground plane. Further in their report, Geogre Baird et al (1964, 95-113) suggests that as the ground level becomes the basis for the overall (public and private) network for pedestrians, each of its constituent parts such as lanes, alleys, public thoroughfare between blocks must be designed in as a contiguous whole that "offers facilities and amenities for lingering and browsing, for meeting people and being met, and for simply enjoying the passing scene." Thus it can physically articulate the public and the civic image of central Toronto, offering diversity of activity and pedestrian amenity. Based on their recommendation, public thoroughfares between blocks will have significant potential to contribute to the revitalization of the public realm within the city. The three levels of walkways need to be well connected with each other and with the sidewalks and streets. Thus they advocate for continuity between the stratified layers of the city. They also talk about the emerging pattern of pedestrian walkways within private buildings, something that is increasingly becoming a key element in
36   

defining the urban morphology. The success of this pattern, they point out, depends on the continuity of the walkways with each other and with the larger network of sidewalks and streets in the public realm as they function as extensions of streets. As a total pattern, pedestrian walkways at all three levels have the potential to offer the public new views of the city as a whole- of streets and open spaces, of buildings, and servicing systems that enable the city's everyday operations at the same time as they strengthen the vertical and horizontal usefulness of the pattern of movement. This thesis takes inspiration from these proposals as it explores the creation of multiple levels of public movement and engagement through the creation of continuous networks of public spaces that will extend beyond sidewalks, through blocks, and the public domain.

2.3_The Urban Social Node_ Reimagining the mid-block spaces as the urban piazza The pedestrian experience within any city must be marked not only by ease of mobility and circulation, but also by the experience offered by the in-between public spaces. The quality of these spaces is not only defined by physical attributes such as form, materiality and details, but is also complemented by non-physical characteristics that arise as responses to an activated and engaging environment. Such environments are best demonstrated by public squares and piazzas within the city. Rooted in history, the urban public squares promote a platform for people from different walks of life to freely congregate, socialize and experience. Often formed at the meeting of two of more streets, squares offer spaces to pause and linger, to interact and engage in informal conversations, activities and social encounters. Their flexibility opens up a kaleidoscopic range of possibilities of social interaction. They offer the pedestrian an urban living room within the city that is open to all. Kevin Lynch's (1960) recommends that well-structured piazzas and squares, defined by high-density buildings and streets, bear the ability to operate as activity condensers. This further appropriates the need so such social nodes. While the openness of such squares create visual relief, a variety of spatial conditions such as areas of shade, differentiated ground, steps seating, furnishings, market stalls and eateries catalyze the potential for multiple type of activity to occur, activating the space. One excellent example of a charged pedestrian experience is the piazza, campo of Venice. The campos and squares of Venice form nodes around which the city and the social life of the people within the city are organized. Venice is a remarkably walkable city with urban forms that provide breathing spaces in its dense urban fabric, and that are conducive to public interaction as they cater to the development of social networks. The Venetian Campi and square are open, often irregularly shaped paved spaces that are surrounded by
37   

buildings. The large number of campi and squares found in Venice demonstrates the dependence of spaces and
scales on the arrangement of buildings around them. They exhibit a great variety in scale, shape and composition that gives each of them their uniqueness inspite of them housing similar activities.

The success of the squares relies significantly on the complementary features that are often offered in conjunction with social nodes found there. Squares in Venice are often replete with amenities such as cafes and retail shops around the perimeter. This in turn gives an additional purpose to the use of the space and encourages a higher concentration of pedestrian traffic. A created supporting spatial condition around the edges thickens with increased public engagement. Given that they are nodes within the networks of streets, they offer multiple entry and exit points that allows the pedestrian to choreograph their movements. The fact that not all access points in a campo or square align further adds curiosity and intrigue in the space by offering varying patterns of circulation rather than just a single line of movement. Thus, amplified opportunities for engagement are presented as one moves across the nodes. Another characteristic of the squares in Venice is that they often have vague starting and ending points that allow for open spaces to blend in the city fabric. Campi accommodate diverse activities without intruding on one another and thereby allow for the juxtaposition of events and for enriching experience. Over time, the campi and squares of Venice have over time proven to be one of the most robust forms of urban open space that cater to social interaction. The fact that Venice is a walkable city unhindered by automobile traffic contributes highly to the success of these spaces. Even where the dominance of the car has relegated the pedestrian experience to sidewalks, a comparable pedestrian experience can be engendered. With the increasing prioritization of the car and the accelerating growth of high-density real estate that disregards the human scale of engagement, public streets of contemporary North American cities are becoming vulnerable. The ability of the street to act as a platform for an engaged and active public domain is being contested at the same time as there is a failure to offer a pedestrian experience that leads to social engagement. Jan Gehl (2010, 48) observed that contemporary cities continue to be constructed to facilitate automobile traffic that averages sixty kilometers-per-hour instead of being responsive to the five kilometers-per-hour speed of pedestrians. This has impacted the pedestrian experience, leading to the development of the "distracted" citizen, as explored by Walter Benjamin in the 1960s. While areas such as the entertainment and commercial districts of a city attempt to engage the pedestrian with storefronts and occasional squares and parks, it is areas such as the financial district that predominantly fail to offer an inviting pedestrian environment. Hence there is a lack of vitality and animation during larger parts of the day. While many tower blocks within the central business district include plaza spaces that attempt to mimic small-scale square-like spaces, their lack of a desirable physical and spatial environment fails to be conducive to social density. The thesis proposal intends to manipulate the urban landscape found within underutilized towerblock plazas and mid-block spaces to create a thickened ground condition that responds to the multi-layered
39   

reality of the contemporary city and that embodies the characteristics of the traditional public square in threedimensions. Proposal for public platforms and urban patio complimented by flexible semi-indoor and indoor spaces are developed at intersection between the different existing strata to vitalize the thickened mid-block square condition. Thus, diversity of movement will be facilitated while catering habitable spaces suitable for lingering. This will aim to enhance pedestrian experience and thicken the public realm.

2.4_Interface of the Street and the Block A typical contemporary response to the tower in open field condition exhibited by the contemporary free-plan block condition tends to be the incorporation of a podium block. However, the result demonstrates a closed-block condition with a rigid and unadaptable closed street boundary with limited interface of the street and the mid-block spaces. This thesis proposal intends to retain the openness of the block while overcoming the leaking undefined condition that marks most contemporary tower-blocks. Varying spatial conditions and views will be created while retaining permeability within the block. The intention is to allow parts of the block to reinforce a relationship to the street and thereby re-engage pedestrians. Porous sharable spaces will be created that span the block; in this way, a street presence will be sustained and pedestrians will be encouraged to enter the block. As one walks through the block, the thoroughfare will offer both close and distant views of a variety of spatial conditions and diversely programmed spaces. This will give a sense of interiority and exteriority and encourage the engagement and lingering of pedestrians. This thesis attempts to extend the pedestrian experience beyond the limitations of the ground plane. It proposes a weaving of below and above-grade layers, even those found within or between blocks. A thickened public realm that will be created by manipulating the ground plane within these blocks. Street activities can be encouraged and facilitated at the same time as thoroughfares are kept open. Thus, the identity of the free block can be nurtured and kept alive.

2.5_Thickening the Public Domain through the thickening of the ground plane The ground plane has always been the primary domain of public activity and orientation within urban centres. However, in contemporary cities, understanding and treating the ground as a single level or fixed datum cannot compete with the needs of a dynamic society. In order to avoid segregation of the public realm into different stratified layers and spaces, the conception of the ground must be continuously morphing in a manner that acknowledges its connection to various layers of activity. Gehl in Cities for People (2001, 65), points out that the pedestrians, who are perhaps the most important consumer of the environment, generally have their vision confined to a horizontal level in that most of what they observe happens right in front of them. This constricts them to the horizontal domain or more accurately the level at which they walk. Even if a person is in a car or any other vehicle, his vision and attention is more or less restricted to the happenings along the lower levels of built structures. Therefore, if there are upper and lower levels such as one finds in Canada, for instance, concourse level, the level has to take on the characteristics of the ground with relation to the pedestrian. It needs to become an important part of the public experience within the city and the transition it offers must be significantly addressed. The thickened ground facilitates a fluid continuity when such transitions occurs; it retains the quality of a continuous space and operates autonomously in this capacity. The folding of the ground allows not only a continued experience of the streets but also permits urban activities to bleed into and out of these spaces. Eva Castro and Alfredo Ramirez (2012, 209) in their essay "Multiplying the Ground," in reference to their works at Groundlab discuss the use and manipulation of the ground as a raw material that entwines with architecture to produce a spatial structure that supports civic functions within the city. They state that the objective of manipulating the ground is:
to create diversity, identity, place: a fertile environment capable of fostering a more complex set of interactions among environmental, cultural and social conditions, thus triggering alternative models of urbanisation that privilege the public realm over the private one, democratise mobility and accessibility in the city. Operations such as thickening, lifting, bifurcating, duplicating and stacking of the ground may foster a synthesis between landscape and architecture: public podiums, infrastructural green spaces, urban patios, land bridges, pedestrian networks, urban terraces and so on, promoting new spatial arrangements and adjacencies. By intensifying social interactions, they create new realignments of programmes and functions; in short, they provide a fertile ground to rethink new urban configurations, challenging existing notions and current trends of public, private and semi-private spaces in the city. (209) 42   

Thus, manipulating the ground as a design paradigm and thickening it in terms of an urban spatial environment can begin to address the traditional building/landscape polarity, while managing to introduce high-density and programmatic diversity into areas that are currently underused. This would in turn increase open space usage and participation, as well as amplify the intensity of pedestrian activity at the street level. The result of all this would be an increased overall value of sites. Although to an extent contradicting the freeing of the ground as prescribed by the Corbusian `Five Points', the thickened yet porous ground would begin to accommodate activities, programs and people, generally instigating more public activities and achieving a re-invigorated public domain. The thickened ground would be the foundation for a juxtaposition of destinations and routes that would bring together a sequence of events through the newly defined thickened realm of city space. For the thickened ground to contribute to the pedestrian experience, it must cater to harmonious interrelationships between different elements and components to function as an urban connective tissue. Echoing a similar notion, Groundlab (2012, 213) in their project proposal for "Deep Ground" explores the fusion of multiple ground data a strategy for the "thickened ground" to "foster intuitive orientation and connectivity in the city." Given the current circumstances within the city cores, under-utilized mid-block spaces need to be regenerated by the interweaving of the different operational layers of the city. A coherent relationship must be established between the public and private domains.

2.5.1_ Components of the thickened ground The thickening of the ground plane significantly depends on how it correlates to the different elements that compose it. The ground can be considered to comprise of i) streets; ii) the spaces between the buildings; iii) the spaces within the buildings at the ground level (public lobbies); iv) the parallel layer of public movement below ground (concourse level) which functions as an extended ground plane of the city and; v) defined public spaces (gardens, plazas, squares). While almost every new private development involves most or all of these components, their conception and treatment is often insufficient to generate a successful interrelationship and therefore fail as proposed components of a vibrant public domain. That is where architecture can begin to instigate the creation of a framework to support opportunities to create vitality. Gehl (2001, 15) proposes that even though a physical framework does not necessarily have a direct influence on the content,
43   

quality and intensity of social contacts, architects and planners do have the ability to stage and therefore affect the potential for people to see, meet and communicate with other people. This in turn becomes important as background and starting point for the other forms of contact. Architecture's response in addressing the public realm can facilitate the creation of multiple opportunities for various forms of public contact. Streets and their adjacent public spaces can work in conjunction to vitalize the pedestrian experience.

2.5.2_Thickened ground and spaces between and within buildings While streets serve the major function of leading to or connecting spaces, destinations, and buildings, it is the quality and experience that they offer, and where they lead, that can activate them. Thus their mutual relationship develops in an activated footprint within the city. Spaces between buildings can encompass all small and medium-sized spaces that have distinct identities and are responsive to the scale of their immediate vicinity. Courtyards, pathways, gardens, setbacks, nooks and corners can be considered in this category. In most cases such spaces are defined by private ownership that are subjected to public right of way. How these spaces are defined and articulated becomes key determinants of their success in terms of public use. This spaces hold great potential in interlocking public and private uses within them. It is vital that these spaces accommodate connectivity and continuity to retain a relationship between not only the various buildings at its proximity but also between the neighboring blocks. Often, such spaces are concealed from street view in the form of internalized courtyard spaces. Such design tactics serves to reserve their spaces for the enjoyment of residents only, despite the fact that they were created for the masses. When thickening the ground, these spaces are no longer treated as residual spaces but as key generators of a sequence of public events. They become the incubators of different kinds of requisite and optional activities. In comparison to streets, they tend to induce longer occupancies and host more time-consuming activities; thus, they operate not merely as circulation spaces but as lingering habitable spaces. Lewis Mumford (1986) suggests that streets alone cannot satisfy all requirements of a public realm. We still need such spaces to accommodate a wider array of activities and functions which in turn can enliven what surround it. The proposal of thickened ground to support the continuous public realm involves not only using spaces between the buildings for interaction, but also utilizing indoor spaces. There needs to be an establishment of continuity between them to ensure participation across it. Allowing juxtaposition of indoor and outdoor spaces will encourage people to come inside and also blur the distinct boundary between the inside and outside and the public and private. This
44   

nature of engagement with spaces within buildings will enhance interface not just at the street level but also at the interface of the building and the block.

2.5.3_Physical manifestation of thickening the ground plane As defined by Eva Castro and Alfredo Ramirez (2012, 214), "The strategy of the thickened ground describes the spatial scheme of a morphology that attempts to understand this space as a surface, acquiring depth and spatial complexity as the different functions and land uses start to combine." The spatial complexity of the thickened ground can be considered to manifest itself in three dimensions: the horizontal, the diagonal and the vertical. This results in the production of greater diversity and continuity, both spatial and functional. In terms of the horizontal plane, flat ground can be reframed to offer a new definition and more interactive means of use as the massive scale of the undefined or under-defined spaces in between the blocks are broken down into interior and exterior environments. In terms of diagonal ground, the public realm is extended to create continuous folding experiential connections between civic spaces that are offered along the constructed layers of the ground and therefore interweave the thickening. It will also re-establish a fluidity of movement between the underground pedestrian concourses that currently remain stratified. The vertical ground will be characterized by the construction of new public structures inserted throughout the site that extend the public domain upwards, interfacing with the existing built structures to produce a rich experience of juxtaposition of private and public programs. The thickening of the ground thus generates a folding, refolding and unfolding of the ground that creates varying height and scales of spaces, offering the pedestrian a journey through a hierarchy of spatial conditions that can support multifarious activities. The resulting spaces can then be further manipulated by varying the points of connections between the folded planes and created platforms. The thickened ground inserts itself into the landscape of the site through reconfiguring existing topography, thereby allowing new interpretation of formal site elements. This allows for the injection of a notion of play, and for the creation of new visual relationships through use of spaces that can contract and expand. Through its spatial organization, the thickened ground intends to offer an enticing and meandering path that will trigger in the pedestrian an interest for exploration. Hajar (2001, 89) stresses that, "The defining characteristics of urban public space are proximity, diversity and accessibility." Thickening of the ground plane not only proposes to bring together different elements (relevant to different nature of users) into close proximity but also proposes an open ended relationship to be created between them that continues to be
45   

redefined it in terms of proximity and accessibility. With its fine-grained development of diverse uses and activities in and around buildings, the thickened ground can provide a healthy platform with ample opportunities to meet the proverbial `other' while opening up the possibility to be used by people from different economic strata. These interwoven, active spaces have ingrained in them the potential to make the whole area come alive. Complemented by circulation spaces that connect to frequently accessed programs existing on site, these spaces aim to seamlessly become part of daily life. The thickened ground achieves its "collective" quality because of the fact that it is not restricted by any boundaries. It allows for the possibility and process of interaction to flow freely from the street to the spaces between buildings, to occupants, and to specific destinations (in no particular order). Interaction within it remains open-ended because the loose formation of activities within it allows for diverse interpretations and transformability. Activity within one space induces activity in the other components of the thickened public domain. Component elements, spaces and programs injected within the thickened ground complement and support each other to form a pattern of events and activities so that the whole area gains from it. As the thickening of the ground is characterized by an undemarcated free-flowing space, it offers people more liberty in interpretation and use. In turn, the notion of a large and ambitious collective domain is established that can operate on the smaller scale of its component parts, or as a collective whole. Either way, it generates civic legibility as a public space. Hajer (2001, 7) mentions that spaces, that achieve a strong public significance by allowing people to identify with them, make the city what it is and therefore become an integral part of urban identity. Thus, the thickening of the ground can begin to address the re-creation of the public domain within areas that are muted in terms of civic use. It can reinstate an urban identity within them.

Fig 44: Strategies of the thickened ground plane

46   

Adoption of the thickened ground would result in an environment that is distinctly different from a mono-functional environment. Public spaces in a mono-functional environment often remain de-animated since the lack of a diverse range of activities results in their use by only a limited number of people. Also, when programming is of a private nature, there is reduced permeability within the site. The fact that many groups of users do not feel welcome in particular spaces further reduces the diversity of people found there. On the other hand, the diversity of the street facades in mixed-use areas gives them a different scale and experience.

2.5.4_Thickening of the ground plane and its response to the human dimension The current phenomenon of development with its increasingly multiplying floor plates tends to deprioritize the need to offer a finer grain in construction that responds to the human scale. Gehl (2001, 74) aptly suggests that "One can catch a brief glimpse of others from a car or from a train window, but life takes place on foot. Only `on foot' does a situation function as a meaningful opportunity for contact and information in which the individual is at ease and is able to take time to experience, pause or become involved." Thus, human scale of the built fabric of the city is responsible for facilitating the interaction between people and urban spaces. Thickening of the ground within such block conditions begins to re-address the human scale. Point-tower structures will begin to blur their disproportionate difference in scale through a hierarchy of scalable spaces that respond to the human dimension. Thickened ground will operate better than individual public places since it will cater to civic legibility in its attempt to reach out to the collective. There will encourage better use of privately owned civic spaces by city dwellers. To create a vibrant public realm, it must be understood that publicly accessible domains need to generate a sense of collectivity. As Hajar (2001, 11) puts it, a truly public domain needs to be "positively valued as spaces of shared experience by people from different backgrounds or with dissimilar interests" (Hajer, 2001 p.11). The users in turn influence the way a space may be used in unexpected manners, thus generating livelier and more diverse experiences.

2.5.5_Thickening of the ground plane and cross programming Thickening of the ground relies significantly on how different land uses manifest within the area of exploration. It is facilitated by cross programming rather than by the compartmentalisation of functions. This

enhances the creation of an open-ended spatial condition that results from the coexistence of quality public spaces with public and private ones, and of open and enclosed spaces which otherwise might have remained isolated infrastructural elements. The result is a blurring of the polarity that exists within the disconnected pre-conditions of sites. A seminal project that marks such a thickening of the ground through programming was OMA's Parc De la Vilette competition submission in the early 1980's. Although more in the realms of landscape architecture, the project celebrated the superimposition, juxtaposition and varying adjacencies of multiple layers of flexible programming that was intended to catalyze use. It proposed the superposition of four strategic layers for organizing different parts of the program: the "east west strip" of varying synthetic and natural surfaces, the "confetti grid" of large and small service points and kiosks, the various "circulation paths," and the "large objects" such as linear and round forests. Thickening in terms of program was however conceived more so in two-dimension, restraining it to the flatness of the horizontal domain of the ground.

Fig 45: Proposal for Parc de La Vilette by OMA

In view of today's urban realities, thickening of the ground cannot ignore the incorporation of the above-and below-ground conditions exhibited by contemporary city-making initiatives. Thickening of the ground must encompass pedestrian activities that remain hidden below the static layer of the ground, at the same time as it remains responsive to the multiplication of the built fabric above ground; only in this way can it operate as a large collective public domain. The manipulation of the ground has to engage in successfully interweaving of the different elements and components found on site as well as inject necessary crossprogramming between layers to induce activities that promote experience of space. Thus it can attract people and in turn generate social interaction and contribute to an engaging urban experience.

48   

Thickening of the ground draws strongly from the strategies of sectional urbanism. Michael Hensel and Tom Verebes in their book Urbanisations (1999, 34) suggest that "sectional design policies interrelate strata of urban public activity surfaces, built volume, interiorized public and private space, and urban landscape systems." Sectionally generated space liberates mass from static ground. Although the experiment of thickening the public domain through manipulation of the ground is explored within the micro-region of a block. The research proposes that when such an approach is integrated on a larger area throughout multiple blocks, it would begin to produce an enriched public domain for public activities while re-prioritizing the pedestrian. The infusion of a new understanding that bring back the public realm to the forefront would impact the collective identity within the contemporary urban scene through reoriented attention to the public realm. Thus offering a new hybrid of social life that activates itself through thickening of the public domain.

3_Re (framing) Key Concepts This thesis focuses on how the public realm interfaces with the built fabric at the human, urban and architectural scale. Core terms such as public realm, public sphere, public domain etc. were defined to reflect on how they could be best interpreted in the context of the thesis. In order for the physical aspect of public spaces to better engage with the non-physical characteristics of public spheres, it becomes important to investigate the changing dynamics of their intersection with the built form. It is also necessary for architecture to govern itself and offer ways for people to engage with it. The lost civic legibility of public spaces in a contemporary architectural framework needs to be regained to overcome the fractured relationship that people encounter at interfaces involving a city's built fabric. Whether this is caused by the rigidity of thresholds between the public and private domains, or by the impact of privatization, designed spaces when intended to be used by the public, must offer visual or physical cues that make evident the possibilities inherent in them. Spaces can open themselves to experience a kaleidoscopic range of experiences as found in the city streets and squares. This research also delves further into some of the key issues that need to be addressed. Accommodating how pedestrians traverse, engage and utilize space is key to ensure success in the thickening of the public realm.

3.1_Reframing_ Public Realm, Public Sphere & Public Domain Public Realm In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society, the German sociologist and philosopher, JÃ¼rgen Habermas (1962, 1) suggests that events and occasions are considered public when they are open to all, in contrast to closed or exclusive affairs. Thus arises the notion of the common as opposed to the concept of private ownership or use. Among the many interpretations of the term "Realm", the one that is most relevant in the context of this research is that of an area of interest or activity (Merriam-Webster Learners dictionary, 2016).Therefore, the realm of the public can be envisioned to be a space that offers opportunities of interests or entertainment to the public, and that gains activation through public participation. That is, the public inhabits or shares the space as a collective body- inclusively or exclusively. Once a realm of the public is created, it can give birth to the public sphere, which as defined by Gerald A. Hauser (1998, 86) in his article Vernacular Dialogue and the Rhetoricality of Public Opinion, is an area in social life where individuals and groups can congregate to freely discuss mutual concerns and to identify and deal with societal problems. Hence, its historic establishment in locations such as coffee shops
50   

and salons, areas where diverse people gather and discuss matters of concern to them. A public sphere can also be activated in a realm that extends beyond such spaces and can encompass additional spaces that gives access to the willing citizen to become a participant in it; this includes public streets, pathways, right of ways, parks and accessible open spaces found within and adjacent to civic buildings and facilities. For example, the ground floor public plaza of HSBC Headquarters in Hong Kong became home to the "Occupy central" protest. This illustrates that the public realm can be established in any place that generates the notion of common interest and offers opportunities for congregation. In regards to activation of the public spheres, Gerard Hauser (1999, 77-80) identifies a few criteria that affect participants. He lists them as follows: 1. "Permeable boundaries": People outside the group can participate (Hauser, 1999, 77). 2. "Activity": Public gatherings are active rather than passive and participants actively engage in discussion (Hauser, 1999, 77-78). 3. "Contextualized language": Participants adhere to the contextualized language to render their respective experiences intelligible to one another (Hauser, 1999, 78). 4. "Believable appearance": The public sphere must appear to be relatable to those participating as well as to the outside public (Hauser, 1999, 79). 5. "Tolerance": In order to maintain a vibrant discourse, opportunities must be provided for the sharing of diverse opinions (Hauser, 1999, 79). These same criteria for a vibrant public sphere can be interpreted through the lens of architecture to identify strategies that can be utilized to instigate vitality and participation within a designed public space. 1. "Permeable boundaries": This could refer to anything from porous thresholds and boundary conditions that allow fluid transitioning between outdoor and indoor spaces designated for public use. 2. "Activity": An architectural framework that can accommodate both spontaneous activities as well as desired ones can catalyse public participation and in turn social interaction. Jan Gehl (1970, 9-12) discusses three different types of activities that the public realm engages in. "Necessary activities" in which participants are to a greater or lesser degree required to participate irrespective of the environment; "optional" activities
51   

that encourage participation based on the environment they offer; and "social activities" that arise from the presence of people in the same space at the same time. The scope of architecture must be inclusive enough to offer spaces for these activities to take place. In the creation of a vibrant public realm, emphasis must be put on facilitating the occurrence of optional and social activities. 3. "Contextualized language": A designed space needs to respond to the context in which it exists in such a way that users can decipher the nature of its use. The success of a public space is dependent upon its response to the urban context. 4. "Believable appearance": For a designed space to be used, it needs to appropriate a legible civic identity that people can associate with. In the case of a public space, it becomes a prerequisite for people to be able to identify the spaces as public in order to use them in the intended manner. 5. "Tolerance": Tolerance in architectural space can derive from an understanding of personal, interpersonal and impersonal public space. Spaces can become stratified as zones of comfort and privacy. Depending on the feeling that a space generates, it may cause occupants to modulate their own personal space. Spatially, in accommodating each of these criteria for a vibrant public realm, the design proposal must engage in the articulation of its transitions and the configuration of its spaces. Depending on the way architecture responds to the context and creation of a relatable appearance, it begins to determine the civic legibility it offers to its potential users. Thus opening up the possibility of an active participation by a greater proportion of the community.

Public Domain Although the word came into use in the mid-17th century, its concept can be traced back to the ancient Roman law of the property right system (Huang, 2009). The law dictates "res nullius, res communes, res publicae and res universitatis" which translates as things that have not yet been appropriated and that can be commonly enjoyed by all citizens, such as air, sunlight, water of the ocean. These were considered to be owned by the city of Rome and could not be owned privately (Huang, 2009, 178-195). Thus, it can be inferred that the domain of the public defines the extents of what the public has access to, and to which it has rights of usage. The domain determines what lies within and beyond the realm of the public; architecture in turn has the ability to define what lies within the access of the public and the nature of activities that can transpire at the intersection. To summarize the discussion, Figure 47 illustrates concepts of public realm, public sphere, and public domain and how they relate to space and architecture.

Fig 47: Architectural responses concepts of public realm, public sphere and public domain

53   

For example, for a public realm to be generated in a space, users need to be offered the opportunitity to enjoy and engage individually or collectively. In order to create this opportunity, an architectural response becomes essential to create a combination of necessary, optional and social activities as set forth by Jan Gehl (1970, 9-12). In this way, amenities are created to attract people and promote public participation. The creation of a public sphere as a platform that accomodates the congregation of the public can arise from enclosed spaces such as salons, shops etc. and/or open spaces such as square and plazas. In order for the public realm to be activated, it is important to address an architectural interpretation of the criteria of permeable boundaries, activities, contextualized language, and tolerance as identified by Gerald Hausers. His concepts of permeable boundaries, activities, contextualized language, and tolerance have been mentioned earlier in this discussion. They in turn define the form and quality of the space created. In the case of a public domain, manipulation of architectural threshold or boundary conditions begins to define the extent of public access it offers. Thus, visual, symbolic and physical cues can be utilized to demarcate any domain that separates or merges the public and the private Public Spaces The definition of public spaces is broad. Most commonly the term is used to describe spaces that are open or accessible to the people either on payment or free of cost (Urban Dictionary, 2005). They can encompass both government or municipally owned public buildings/spaces or privately owned ones. They can appear within the confines of a building or operate as an extension (indoor or outdoor). Public spaces accommodate socialization and congregation of people on a daily basis. They are social spaces that can loosely constitute meeting places, urban squares, cultural buildings, social centers, and outdoor civic spaces, anything that offers the programming elements essential to our communities. A typology of outdoor public spaces is outlined in the diagram below.

Fig 48: Typology of Public spaces

54   

In contemporary practice, the number of spaces that can be categorized within the definition of public buildings are expanding. More and more private functions are becoming public in nature, either partially or as a whole. Figure 48 is an attempt to list a few categories of public buildings, however, the list continues to grow.

3.2_Nature / Types of users An architectural framework that intends to highlight public participation and engagement needs to accommodate the varied nature of possible uses by the diverse users who interface with it. Only then can it begin to choreograph moments that encourage involvement. This thesis identifies the group of possible participants into four categories as follows: Inhabitants: This group refers to individuals who dwell, occupy or participate on a regular basis in the space. The preoccupation of the architect to a great extent has been in the accommodation of the inhabitant within the designed space. Their needs and desires often operate as the common denominator of design conception. However, a designed space can expect to be celebrated not only when it provides an efficient design for its inhabitants, but also ideally when it choreographs the interface of users in a harmonious manner that is enriching not only to inhabitants but also to visitors, passersby, and drifters. Visitors / Guests: This grouping refers to individuals who visit the space occasionally. The nature of their visit may be formal or informal and can be accommodated differently accordingly. Their engagement is temporary. However, the time of their engagement / interaction may vary depending on their purpose of their visit or by how the designed space manages to engage them. Passersby: Pedestrians may be defined as recognized individuals who are passing by, especially on foot, through or around the site or the adjacent street. The discourse of architecture often neglects to pay significant attention to this category of users. However, when it comes to the design of public spaces, special attention must be placed on the provision of visual hooks, perhaps through desirable microclimates or intriguing forms, to engage the passersby as they traverse the space and encourage them to return to it later. By-Standers: An extension of the passers-by group, this category of users includes individuals who linger in the space transiently but do not necessarily engage in the functions offered by the space. This group includes individuals who use the space as a waiting or meeting space, as well as those who pass time there but may not engage with it.
55   

Fig 49: Mapping the nature of users interacting with the designed space

Consideration of each of these user groups has an influence on how design manipulates the ways in which participants perceive the space. Design can begin to choreograph how users utilize or appropriate the proposed spaces, exclusively or collectively. The gradient between public and private spaces is thus addressed as user groups span their continuums. To further explore how the configuration, arrangement, scale and ground conditions can effect user interface, a series of explorations were done through physical mass models; these are found in 1.1 of the Appendix.

3.3_Interface of pedestrians with built forms, public spaces and city streets_ The urban veins of the city and the urban living room As building have proliferated in the cities over the last century, the use of cars has also drastically increased. One result has been a lessening of the publicness of street life and an overall decrease in the number of gathering spaces available. This change has impacted the pedestrian's spatial experience of urban spaces. Open city spaces, especially in areas dominated by private uses such as business districts, began to be merely used for circulation as opposed to places to linger or rest. With streets operating as narrow corridors of movement and public spaces scattered in three dimensions throughout the city, spaces intended to enhance the urban social fabric remain disconnected from it. The lack of homogeneity conveys the
56   

impression that the public realm is no longer designed for public activities but merely exists out of necessity. This contributes to a limited amount of interaction between the active participants in city life. It also leads to the creation of a number of dead zones. The overall outcome has been that growing cities are often characterized by a shrinking of the public realm. The strong delineation between public streets and the built environment has produced rigid boundaries that prevent the city from functioning as a coherent whole and contributes to urban lives becoming increasingly introverted. One of the prominent proponents of enhancing street life, Jane Jacobs (1958, 50) instigated a powerful debate through her book, The Death and Life of American Cities, where she brought to readers' attention to the importance of streets in the creation of a vibrant city. She suggests streets, sidewalks, and public spaces are the most important parts of any city as they create potentials for interaction of residents and function as the stage for on-going relationships. She further advocates that "Public space is about sustaining tens and even hundreds of small relationships with a diverse group of people; relationships that are neither impersonal nor intimate, but ones that are part of what makes urban life special". Continuing in the same vein, William Whyte (1980) in The Social Life of Small Public Spaces echoes Jacob's position regarding the importance of social life in public spaces. Whyte's discussion focuses on the importance of the collective form in these spaces and on how a physical framework holds the potential to cater to moments of engagement with the city. He believes that the social interaction that unfolds in public spaces is vital to the city in that it delivers diversity and vibrancy. Michael De Certeau (1984, 93) in The Practice of Everyday Life suggests that the story of the city is written through the constant movement and interaction of the people that walk through it, a story that is experienced and felt. He suggests that "The ordinary practitioners of the city live down below, below the thresholds at which visibility begins. They walk Â­ an elementary form of this experience of the city. They are walkers, whose bodies follow the thick and thins of an urban `text' they write without being able to read it...These practitioners make use of spaces that cannot be seen. The paths that correspond in this intertwining, unrecognized poem in which each body is an element signed by others, elude legibility." He identifies the city as a collection of texts and pedestrians as story-tellers who dictate urban stories. Through their movements along a multitude of intertwined paths and detours, they weave an urban fabric in ways that potentially transgress the underlying "map" imposed by the administrative strategies of corporate and government interests. He employs the speech act theory to interpret walking and its relationship to the city. Through it, he proposes that a distinction can be made between the organisation and forms of city systems (the city as a text book), and the ways in which these forms are reiterated. Trajectories of the walker can make him the user, reader, and rewriter of the city text. The trajectories, shortcuts, and detours taken by the
57   

pedestrian become phrases in the story telling of the city. Any particular trajectory or detour, Certeau suggests, creates a "long poem of walking," out of the formal spatial possibilities at its disposal. City streets according to him are filled with forests of gestures that cannot become fully discerned as wandering along them makes "some parts of the city disappear and exaggerates others, distorting it, fragmenting it, and diverting it from its immobile order". He believes that these narratives and "symbolizations" that create these habitable spaces are embodied by the city's inhabitants. City streets become the weavers of the stories of urban experience in that they become the keys to reading the public realm, to understanding the spaces of the city dweller, and to following paths of experience. Jan Gehl (2010, 6) in Cities for People suggests that "Cities must urge urban planners and architects to reinforce pedestrianism as an integrated city policy to develop lively, safe, sustainable and healthy cities. It is equally urgent to strengthen the social function of city space as a meeting place that contributes toward the aims of social sustainability and an open and democratic society." Physical qualities of urban public realms significantly contribute to the strengthening of public activities and collective behaviors within it. Thus, the scope of architecture must include provisioning the grounds for activating civic space. Civic practices can be enhanced by manipulating how cities provide for the circuits of flow and for places to encounter others. Streets and public spaces together provide settings for the generation of those social interactions that make a place engaging. As suggested in the words of several philosophers and urbanists, there is a strong link between urban public spaces and urban civic virtue and citizenship. However, in the contemporary city, pedestrian experience and public life are being gradually phased out. One reason for this is the growing inclination to shift many street activities, below grade to subterranean pedestrian routes (such as PATH, in Toronto); this further drains the city of vitality. Although such routes provide a sensible solution to combat harsh weather conditions during certain times of the year, the conception of segregated layers of the city that are only supplemented with shops, lacks a legible reconnection with the city and thus must be reframed. A balance must be regained between vehicular traffic, pedestrian flow, and urban legibility to provide a constant and continuous experience of the city.

3.4_Public Parts of the Private Realm Contemporary approaches increasingly place public spaces away from the heart of the city and into sections of buildings' private premises. However, they tend to lack the vitality found in outdoor public spaces. William H. Whyte (1980, 79) suggests that when public spaces are located indoors, people tend to perceive
58   

them as less public than those found outdoors. Be it for fulfillment of statutory city clauses that require the provision of public spaces in exchange for additional floors, or only from the desire to create diversity, these mutated public spaces often fail to generate the notion of being public. Accessibility and security often become issues that limit participation by the public at large and lead to a failure to instigate significant social interaction. The keenness of all social classes to equally enjoy such privatized and compartmentalized spaces seems to lessen. Regarding the public parts of the private realm, George Baird et al. (1974, 115) in On Building Downtown suggest that all pedestrian walkways in the public parts of the private realm needs to be open to the public at large, at least during hours that correspond to the hours of TTC subway operations. They need to be appropriate in size to accommodate regular as well as unpredicted pedestrian traffic flow. They need to make their physical continuity visible and legible, either through their design or with the aid of signage. For vitality and use they must also provide public amenities at areas bordering them to diversify them as much as possible in terms of pedestrian activity. To ensure that the public parts of the private realm are well connected to each other and to the pedestrian movement pattern, appropriate linkages between the public and the private realms must be provided between buildings, between buildings and streets, rights of way and public walkways (George Baird et al., 1974, 123). The report further suggests that any linkages between the ground level and the levels above and below needs to be legible when they are associated to a private function; such linkages should also begin to appear between blocks. It proposes suitable and welldesigned public linkages that would ensure that different levels of public movement and activity are well connected, both visually and physically (George Baird et al., 1974, 123). The report states that the success of such spaces lie in their being complemented by places for people to spend time in. These can be spaces that they pass through or use (to linger, to sunbathe, to watch birds and stars, to eat outside, to meet someone or be met, to view the surrounding city and neighbouring areas, or just to enjoy whatever is going on nearby). It suggests that when the private realm is adjacent to public walkways and vertical linkages it benefits from having a variety of public open spaces (George Baird et al., 1974, 135). Such spaces should not be wasted by being allowed to become left-over setback spaces, but should be utilized to re-engage the pedestrian experience of the city. They suggest that open spaces will only prove to be useful if they are well connected to public networks of walkways and thereby rendered accessible to all. It can be inferred that when public spaces are provided in the private realm, they need to be legible, must offer conditions and spaces that would encourage their use, and must not become disconnected from the experience of the city. Many argue that the tower and podium typology offers a reasonable solution for the integration of the public realm with the private uses of the tower, as it facilitates maintenance of authenticity of private
59   

functions. However, this thesis argues that private development of podiums characterized predominantly by shops makes the public space more rigid in its form and activities. The result is capitalizing on independent consumption that creates a more introverted relationship with the city. Thus, although the typology was created as a buffer for more fluid transition with the city, it takes on an identity of its own that limits the multidimensionality of urban life. Many projects have attempted an integration of three-dimensional matrices to provide diversity as well as to encourage an extension of the public realm. For example, in many of his proposals, Ken Yeang proposes the insertion of the public and diverse natures of the city into buildings. Yeang (2002, 102) mentions that "Urban design involves the provisioning of public spaces such as plazas, boulevards and avenues that respect the city's unique cultural differences. The shifting nature of these public spaces is the nexus that links the divergent interests of the city, giving people the qualitative experience that they are somewhere. It is the equivalents of these that we need to design into the high-rise." Many contemporary projects offer public space in the form of sky lobbies and corridors at tower levels which are at the maximum connected by the elevated bridging connections. However, a disconnect is established with the ground plane of the city that prevents these spaces from being used by the city dwellers; eventually they end up being appropriated for use by building inhabitants of buildings, thus becoming privatized public spaces. The subsidized nature of privately owned public spaces often leads them to be designed without regard to how they will connect to the city; they therefore fail to get a legible reading by the city dweller. They remain distanced from pedestrian pathways and because of their private outlook fail to encourage participation. The thesis intends to re-examine how architecture can play a part in re-creating an image for these privately owned public spaces, how it can transform them into active, desirable and engaging spaces within the city.

3.5_Civic Legibility Henri Lefebvre (1991, 156) defines social space as a social product, and suggests that space is considered both as a precondition and a result of the production of society. In his book The Production of Space, he writes, "The form of social space is encounter, assembly, simultaneity...social space implies actual or potential assembly at a single point, or around that point." He suggests that the spatial practice of social spaces relies on the simultaneity of social activities which he identified as "Networks of Interaction". If spatial practice is understood by how individuals appropriate space, then it can be assumed that the key to the creation of successful public spaces is to have them be identifiable by city dwellers as theirs to inhabit and
60   

appropriate, thus offering civic legibility. Spaces can advance from being merely used for circulation to becoming networks of social interaction. In his essay Building, Dwelling, Thinking (1971), Martin Heidegger suggests that it is not only the act of building that brings places into existence, but also that a sense of place is achieved through how a space allows human beings to recognize it. In that sense, legibility of a space allows its users to appropriate it as platforms for interaction and experience; this results in establishing a sense of place which in turn becomes the critical determiner of the success or failure of any architectural development. Hornecker (2005, 1) expresses that humans are spatial beings who live and meet each other in space and that the human body acts as the central reference point for perception. Since movement and perception are tightly coupled, humans tend to interpret spatial qualities (or positioning of other objects) in relation to their own body. Physical interactions characterized by manipulation, movement, and gestures lead to stimulating experiences that instigate mental energy necessary for engagement. Such a notion is stated also by Tuan in his book Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience. Tuan (2001, 34-50) explores the spatial concepts of space and place as co-dependent relationships that formulate human interaction in the environment. He further states that spatial values, personal relationships and body locations help to foster those moments of pause that aid in the creation of memory and a sense of place. He discusses how frontal space acts as the primary visual realm allowing viewers to see and process what they see; on the other hand, the space behind the body is less visible and relies more on alternate senses such as hearing. Thus space is differentiated in accordance to the orientation of the body, acting as a reference point in space. How architecture facilitates the orientation of public movement within the site significantly contributes to its ability to cater to public participation.

Fig 50: Diagramming how a body's position in space impacts the frequency and nature of interaction

61   

Thomas A.Markus (2003, 15) in the first chapter of his book Embodied Utopias: Gender, Social Change and the Modern Metropolis, discusses embodiment in space. He refers to different spatial structures and their ability to create, make possible, or limit, entirely different social relations. He states that all built spaces inevitably structure social relationships by creating inside-outside links that tend to promote categories of 'inhabitants', 'visitors', and 'strangers'. A rethinking of threshold conditions can begin to facilitate a continuous and legible experience of public realms that encourages continuity as opposed to delineation. This will facilitate the city dweller's interpretation and decipherment of public spaces (indoor or outdoor) as spaces offered to them for use. The sterility of urban built environments arises from the conception of structures as grand physical manifestations that aren't associated with the behavioral tendencies of its citizens. A move away from conceiving architecture as a purely physical mechanism to one that is intended to trigger human reaction can give rise to a more livable city. This will allow built forms to become active participants in the city instead of standing as isolated alien entities. Urban consciousness becomes necessary to enhance the relationship between a city and its inhabitants.

3.6_Thresholds_ Interiority and Exteriority Vs Inside and Outside: Christine McCarthy (2005, 116), in her essay Toward a Definition of Interiority, highlights how `inside' and `outside' are architectural prescriptions tied to the boundary of buildings, whereas interiority and exteriority inter-weave and operate without formal constraints. The perception of inside and outside spaces in terms of interiority and exteriority enables them to be understood as abstractions; this facilitates the recognition and definition of spaces not as absolute, as has been traditional in architecture, but changeable according to how the body perceives them as it moves around. This relates to Tuan's notions of space, place and the body. McCarthy goes on to recommend that through the notion of interiority as opposed to `insideness', boundary conditions of an environment can be manipulated to allow it more flexibility and to operate with mobility and porosity, thereby encouraging participation with the environment. Through notions of interiority, conceptions of space and place can start to recognize and respond to the cultural, physical and technological developments within a society. For the creation of a continuous, legible public realm that is defined by harsh boundaries of inside and outside, the framework can start operating based on notions of interiority and exteriority to produce a porous environment that caters to inhabitation and interaction. The conception of space in these terms will allow architectural proposals to ensure a constant reconnection to the city's entirety and thus become active participants within the city space.
62   

Two examples were chosen to illustrate how the conception of space through notions of interiority and exteriority can formulate the creation of a fluid and continuous environment exhibiting porous boundaries. The first is of Charkola, Faculty of Fine Art at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh. Designed by Muzharul Islam, the project explored the notion of exteriority and interiority by way of creating a fluid transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. The second example that demonstrates a gradient in threshold is House N in Japan by Sou Fujimoto.

3.6.1_Charukola, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh (Fluid Transitioning between indoor and outdoor) This project was inspired by the Bengali "Bagan Bari"-"the house in a garden" concept and therefore is highly sensitive to its context and to nature. The design embraces large continuous verandahs that shade the walls, windows of classroom and studio spaces inside. In addition to offering a climatic buffer, this enables a gradual transition from outside to inside, from nature to built space. Its layout echoes the courtyard house concept found in rural areas of Bangladesh where outer and inner houses are separated through a courtyard. A sculptural stair serves as an internal courtyard; it separates the
Fig 51: Fluid threshold condition at Charukola Institute of Fine Arts, Dhaka

galleries in the front pavilion and the common rooms

from the classrooms that appear after one passes the threshold of the courtyard. The entire structure appears to be accessible and open. A sense of private domain is created through increasing depth with relation to the exterior and through increasing interior depth. The verandahs, along with the columned entry space, offer a flexibility of use and can transform as needed. During festivals, the area transforms into an active public hub. At other times, it becomes a breakout space for students and visitors to whom it offers an ephemeral experience with its juxtaposition of the man-made and natural. In terms of fenestration, perforated screens define layers of public and private while retaining a degree of continuity. The project embodies fluidity through its layers of spaces while facilitating a harmonious integration of architecture and landscape.

House N  Conventional House  Fig 52: Gradient in threshold of House N, Sou Fujimoto Future House

Comprised of three shells, the House N by Sou Fujimoto presents a small-scale exploration of a gradient of threshold through the formal manipulation of the building skin. The outermost shell demonstrates this premise. It is semi-porous and creates a semi-open garden that leads into the second shell that encloses a smaller covered outdoor space. The third shell covers and creates the most intimate interior spaces. Through nested thresholds of varying scales, porosity and proximity, an interplay between interiority and exteriority is created in contrast to the strongly defined boundaries of conventional houses. A gradation of domain is thus demonstrated.

3.6.3_Gradients in City Spaces: In Design of Urban Space: An Inquiry into Socio-Spatial Process, Ali Madanipour (1996, 3) identifies urban space as encompassing all the buildings, objects and spaces in an urban environment, as well as the people, events, and relationships within them. By his definition, urban space can be understood as the amalgamation of people, objects and events. Based on the perspective he presents, there exists in contemporary cities a binary separation between the built form and the public realm which needs addressing. In order to diffuse or dissolve the polarity created, the transition between them must be an area that attracts

and merges rather than repels. Manipulation of transitional thresholds between the different entities of a city- such as its public and private realms, or in built and open spaces--allows these phenomena to be interrelated rather than just existing in opposition. Boundaries, as defined by edges, denote a physical movement from one area to another. When edges start to be conceived and created as space-points of transition, they start to become the melting points of the interface between two entities. In the urban landscape, where the city is defined by a ground plane (streets and open spaces) atop which sits sculptural built forms, more often than not there is a sharp-edge condition property lines being strictly outlined. This limits a fluid movement between the city and the designed space. In the case of the shoreline, in spite of it being the meeting point of two different entities, the edge condition is an ephemeral one that allows for the experience of a hybrid space. It operates as a dynamic space that allows for movement to play out in multiple ways, both physically and metaphysically. The replication of such an environment can begin to accommodate a spatial continuity of the public realm by blurring rigid boundary lines as it moves between public and private realms. When the interface of the public and private realms offers a juxtaposition, it allows for these traditionally binary oppositions to translate into a sense of mutual reciprocity. That would allow for interaction while still maintaining privacy, authenticity, and identity. It would mark the move from a non-associative relationship to a relationship of inter-association. What is necessary is for an interface gradient to be established. Certain architectural projects such as the Vancouver Public Library illustrate how the notion of boundary can extend beyond a line. It shows that a gradient can extend beyond the interface of the city and the built form to allow fluid transitioning between intermediate public and private realms. The transition becomes a thickened shared space that contributes to an enhanced social experience.

3.6.4_Vancouver Public Library, Vancouver, Canada (Extending of the city's texture within the built form) Designed by Moshe Safdie, the Vancouver Public Library occupies nearly an entire block of the city. The cylindrically shaped building is reminiscent of the Roman Coliseum. It attempts to reflect the city of Vancouver itself: its economy, nature and its ethnically diverse residents. What is interesting, however, is that its form accommodates an opening that allows for the city's landscape to swoop in. A partially internal public plaza finds its place in what can be considered a privately maintained domain. The library with its extended piazza creates a meeting place in the city and supports such ancillary facilities as restaurants and
65   

shops similar in appearance to those found on the streets. With its street light-like fixtures, the project aims to recapture street life on its premises.

Fig 54: Continuation of the city fabric into the Library complex of Vancouver Public Library

The library is designed as a seven-story rectangular box that houses books and periodicals and all other library services. A free-standing, elliptical, colonnaded wall wraps around the semi-open or semienclosed public space. Public spaces inside the building look onto, and are visually and spatially integrated into, this very open-to-public space within. In terms of materiality, the city texture continues into the space and encourages the pedestrian to enter it. In an attempt by the architect to introduce garden elements into an urban setting, the roof of the library is designed to serve as a large public garden. The project is of interest to this thesis as it attempts to weave the city fabric seamlessly into the design of the built form, thereby blurring the boundary that often separates the two. The space for the public remains available at all hours, even after the library closes down. There is a glass enclosure that creates a microclimate of its own without giving the public plaza the sense of being an enclosed place. Thus an attempt has been made to offer a gradient that allows public and private functions to mutually share and interact. The contemporary urban landscape presents a multiplicity of meanings. In his essay Programming the Urban Surface, Alex Wall (1999, 233) suggests that landscape can be defined as "an extensive and inclusive ground-plane of the city, the field that accommodates buildings, roads, utilities, open spaces, neighborhoods, and natural habitats". Thus, to conceptualize an extension of the urban street experience within a designed space, it becomes relevant to consider the city landscape as an inclusive field of shared spaces in a three-dimensional matrix that is responsive to society's mutations and alterations.

3.7_Hybridity to vitalize City Space Creating mutable threshold spaces calls for the creation of a gradient between the public and the private, the outside and the inside, the city and the built form, a hybrid condition which allows for a multiplicity of interpretations. Jane Jacobs (1961, 75) suggests that "Intricate mingling of different uses in cities is not a form of chaos. On the contrary, they represent a complex and highly developed form of order." Engaging the public and private through shared use of a form of common hybrid spaces would work to vitalize the city through a new definition of order. In a similar vein, in his book The timeless way of building, Christopher Alexander (1979, 81-94) advocates the mixing of the habitual and experiential patterns of the city. He recommends that, "Every place is given its character by certain patterns of events that keep on happening there...These patterns of events are locked in with certain geometric patterns in the space. Indeed, each building and each town is ultimately made out of these patterns in the space, and out of nothing else; they [patterns in the space] are the atoms and molecules from which a building or a town is made profound." Instead of stringing together city events, they should be made to overlap. Public parts of the private realm can, through manipulation of geometric patterns of physical spaces, provide an environment that is enriching for the city dwellers. The creation of hybrid spaces will generate a thickened public domain with multiple uses. This thesis proposes to create crossed-fertilized urban environments through the creation of hybrid spaces. The interplay of these urban spaces and built forms will achieve a diverse and continuous environment. The term `hybrid', derived from Latin, is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as something heterogeneous in origin or composition. It embodies mixed characteristics that results from the combination of different entities. It is broadly used in several contexts across different disciplines to refer to the condition activated when constituent parts of the whole are derived from multiple sources. In architecture, it can be denoted as any constructed space that aims to contain more than the single property exhibited by the original space. There is a wide range of possibilities of hybrid instances within architecture. A hybrid instance can be created by the engagement of physical and virtual spaces. It can also be the interface between landscape architecture, infrastructure and built architecture. In the context of this research, the hybrid condition is created by the overlap between the public and private realm to create an activated condition of coexistence as opposed to an existing isolated circumstance. Hybridization is especially relevant to contemporary architecture since it continuously explores the rationale for the combination of unexpected functions. Architecture can promote hybrid spaces through an intentional incorporation of different entities of programs-public and private (designed hybridization), or provide a physical structure as a framework that

67   

allows for spontaneous activities, events and interpretations to evolve. In the latter case, the extent of hybridization is infinite as it offers polyvalent spaces users can adapt according to their wishes. Regarding hybridity in buildings, Steven Holl (2011, 43-44) points out in the book This is Hybrid, that "The intimacy of private life and the sociability of public life dwell within the hybrid and produce constant activity, making it a building working full-time. It is not a disciplinary prototype but a concentration of interests..." The ideal hybrid he recommends promotes the meeting of the public and the private spheres. Design hybridity opens up the possibility of urban porosity with the aim of creating pedestrian-oriented urban space. It can create accessible social condensers for communities. Programmatic hybridity in building sections is not a recent phenomenon but has existed throughout history. For example, the house over the shop can be seen as the simplest form of hybridity and it is found in different cultures. However, when this hybridity spreads from a building's plan to its section, the vertical separation of its constituent parts lead to a decreased level of urban activity in comparison to when it is at-grade. When in conjunction with private spaces such as office buildings, they further get segregated and begins to depart from the whole of a hybrid. As Holl describes, hybridity accommodates for the occurrence of unexpected, unpredictable events. It leaves room for intimate relationships to be established and coexistence to emerge. He suggests that hybridity is extroverted in character as it acts an active participant on the urban stage. Hybridity fights against spatial segregation; it looks instead to achieve unity. It allows for a circumstance to establish that results to be beneficial to all its composing parts. Steven Holl states that dense environments with land use limitation are an ideal field for to cultivate hybrid situations. Hybridity is especially relevant in the city where it is used as a tool to improve living conditions and to revitalize environments. In terms of urban planning the definition of a hybrid includes perspective, grid insertion, dialogue with other urban landmarks and interrelationship with surrounding public spaces (Holl, 2011, 43-44). Jane Jacobs (1961, 340) wrote, "The point of cities is multiplicity of choice". Research reinforces the notion that hybrid city spaces offer a frame that accommodates the evolution of spontaneous growth and offers diverse interpretations. Hybrid forms offer hybrid experiences.

3.8_City's Event Space_ Expected and Unexpected Experience: In Toronto, contemporary buildings in the downtown core usually offers either a four to five storey podium condition, or areas of set-back. These are the two viable means of facilitating the public realm. More
68   

often than not, they remain as separate entities with limited opportunity for collective activity. While the podium condition tends to be overly prescriptive, the setback option can lack definition and can fail to have the ability to offer meaningful experiences at its interface with the street. With regards to spatial practice, Henri Lefebvre (1991, 101-136) suggests that spatial practice is what offers the material dimension to social activities and interact; it is generated from simultaneity and recurrence of activities, "a system resulting from articulation and connection of elements or activities". Thus it can be interpreted that its segregated forms can fail to generate consistent city activity and therefore will need to be reframed. City experiences, as Michael De Certeau (1984) suggested, arise from the city dweller's interpretation of the existing spatial conditions and can transform them into an experiential journey. They present unlimited possibilities such as discovering new places, interacting with strangers, coming across a friend, etc. The user engages with the space he/she is inhabiting and anticipates the journey through the city. Time can be spent individually or collectively. The public realm of the city-its streets, sidewalks and public spaces-can host the breadth of social life and become a platform for the unfolding of social interactions. The result is the creation of diversity, vibrancy and excitement. In his book City sense and city design, Kevin Lynch (1995, 408) writes about the general concept of `openness' and identifies good public space as one that invites human interaction without excessive prescription and programming. He suggests that such spaces allow for an opening up to possibilities of change and spontaneity. They encourage and accommodate openness of choice, access, use, manipulation, perception, view, understanding and experience. Aside from the successful open public squares present in the city, most contemporary public spaces lack such forms of openness. They do not always seem inviting or conducive to that spontaneity which must be regained for the generation of vitality.

4_Thickening the public realm_ Design Strategies to extend and expand the public realm The continuous densification of the urban fabric often lacks a supporting growth in the public domain. This leads to the need for the public realm to steer itself into growing alongside the private realm, either from its inception or later emerging incrementally as a response. In order to identify or rather categorize the possible ways in which growth happens, this thesis explores three themes that can aid in strategizing the ways in which the public realm thickens and engages with the built fabric. These themes will guide the development of the design proposal that aims to test the thesis. Each of the themes are first discussed in terms of their definition along with a conceptual model. Then a relative case study is examined to place the concept in an architectural context. Finally a proposal is developed based on these themes. The themes include symbiosis, augmentation and permeation.

Fig 55: Exploration of themes to identify how the public realm engages with the built fabric

70   

4.1_Strategy-01_ Symbiosis Originally a term found in biology, symbiosis covers the broad range of close interactions between two or more different species. Coined by Albert Bernhard Frank in 1877, `symbiosis' denotes a nature of interaction between species that is different from regular interactions. In a symbiotic relationship, the two species in the relationship live together, as translated from its Greek origin:  meaning "together" and  defined as "living" (Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, 2005). To identify more precisely the nature of this interaction, symbiosis is further divided into three categories: Mutualism or Coexistence, Commensalism and Parasitism (Doughlas, 2010, 5-12). A mutualistic relationship in symbiosis can be interpreted as coexistence since it refers to a type of interaction that is characterized by a mutual existence of two species (in same time and space), where both benefit from the relationship in a direct, indirect, visible or interpretive way (Pierre-Joseph van Beneden, 1876, Animal parasites and messmates). The coexistence continuum exhibits two conditions. The first is that of a passive coexistence, where relationships are characterized by unequal power and equity: one dominates and benefits more while the other is neither harmed nor helped. Another term for this is commensalism. The second condition is that of active coexistence. It occurs when relationships are characterized by a recognition and respect for diversity and by an active embracing of differences. There is equal access to all resources and opportunities. ("Coexistence." Beyond Intractability, Khaminwa, 2003). Symbiosis can further be classified by the nature of physical attachment between the two coupling entities. In the case where participants have bodily union, it is referred to as conjunctive symbiosis; when they are not in union, it is called disjunctive symbiosis. This is explored in the design proposal where the inserted framework for the extended public realm attaches to or remains at close proximity to its host, the existing structures on site. On the other end of the spectrum of symbiotic relationships is parasitism. It is characterized by a non-mutual symbiotic relationship between species. One species, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host. In the domain of architecture, any sort of exploitive form of architecture that creates a forceful relationship with a host building can be considered a form of parasitic architecture. However, for the purposes of this thesis, the design strategy will refer to mutual symbiosis, that is, one that establishes an activated coexistence between the public and the private realms. Both partners mutually reinforce, complement and benefit from each other. In architecture, symbiosis can manifest itself through hybridization of programs; through diversification of the built environment; or through the combination of new with old, built with unbuilt, man-made with natural. Symbiosis allows for multi-valency to occur. That is, a single entity can

71   

gain the ability to embody or represent more than one thing at the same time. Multiple interpretations of experience can be accommodated within one space. In architecture, the mutual reinforcement of symbiotic relationships is used to create more creative, interconnected and convivial spaces. The demonstration of symbiosis can be either physical in nature, philosophical in interpretation, or both. Since symbiosis results in the fusion of opposing facets of the built environment, it can foster a more unified and coherent architecture. People's perception of how different elements in the urban environment interact influences how they respond to their surroundings, and thus impacts the intensity of their use. The fact that symbiotic relationships in architecture attempt to pair and link various elements means that their relative positions and formal qualities have significant importance. Salingaros (2005, 88) comments that for coupling to occur between two elements, there must be a degree of contrast between them; only in this way can they mutually reinforce each other. For example, an open continuous streetscape and an uncovered porch do not offer the best opportunity for coupling, since they have little to contribute to each other. For a symbiotic relationship to be beneficial, a degree of contrast, both in formal and spatial qualities, must differentiate the separate entities involved. This allows for each element to be stronger when juxtaposed and coupled with the other than it was in isolation. Visual impacts and their spatial qualities can be heightened in a way that guides the perception of a space by potential users. A symbiotic relationship in architecture doesn't necessarily require a physical coupling; it can be produced through the perception of users. Symbiosis can occur through visual, structural, functional and geometrical means. However, adjacency of two opposing elements doesn't necessarily result in a coupling. There must be an opportunity for a reaction or interface to occur between them. They must be able to respond to each other, much like a chemical reaction must occur between two chemical elements for it to result in a new product. Design elements such as form, textural surfaces, colors, patterns and details can often be used as tools to instigate such an interaction. Symbiotic architecture can transform its host bodies, can redefine or reconfigure built structures while offering a new space and orientation to the public that will encourage participation. For instance, a symbiotic relationship can make a private building more open to the public by creating an inside-out circumstance at the interface of the two opposing nature of spaces. This can in turn further activate host spaces and impart social information to the public realm. A new terrain for a shared space between the public and private domains can thus be delineated. Prevailing systems of spatial and social control within an existing site or project can be exploited to illuminate further possibilities for public engagement within the built environment and the city.
72   

Symbiosis can maximize mutual reinforcement between persisting polar conditions to ensure urban and architectural coherence, providing benefits to both the community and environment (Salingaros, 2005). The symbiosis of various elements in our built environment allows for a dynamic balance to be established between opposing elements and allows it to continuously mutate and evolve with time.

Conceptual Models_ The first experiment explored the coexistence of two materials exhibiting two different natures. Wood blocks and wire mesh are separate entities with significantly different characteristics that can wrap around each other in a way that is mutually beneficial. The block structure supports the mesh, giving it a place to wrap itself around, while the mesh supports the block in that it gives its skin diversity. The second experiment explored a similar condition using two different materials to demonstrate the concepts of host and entity (presented in white). These surfaces exhibit conditions of both interface and adjacency. They are supportive of one another and neither disrupts the condition of the other. A hybrid situation is expected to arise at places where interface occurs between different entities. For coexistence to operate efficiently, each of the two entities that come together must accommodate an interface.

Relative Case Study_01: A precedent that reflects this sort of a symbiotic relationship is the Galata Bridge that spans the Golden Horn in Istanbul, Turkey. Originally a mobile bridge made by Turks by placing ships side by side to transfer their troops across the water from one side of the Golden Horn to the other, it underwent several design iterations to become what it is today: a 490-meter-long steel bridge. This rather unattractive drawbridge, through establishing a symbiotic relationship with growing public functions, has
73   

become a prime location for gathering within the city. It exhibits a thoughtful layering of active programming and infrastructure that bringing out the best out in each other. The Galata Bridge consists of two levels with six automobile lanes: two tram tracks and pedestrian walkways. The upper level serves as the central pathway for the subway. It also has lines of roads for automobiles that are sandwiched between the sidewalks. The lower level allows for the parasitic growth of the market place: restaurants and eateries infringe on the core and there are sidewalks on the edge. The docks at the base of the bridge on the south side have several floating kitchens. Boats and ferries offer people a place to enjoy their meals as they watch the rush of ferry boats and fishermen (Sansal, 1996). The symbiotic relationship found here allows for a thickening of the public realm on an infrastructure, that is the host drawbridge. Through the coupling of these two diverse functions, the space as a whole gains momentum, ensuring that a significant number of people circulate and use it at all times. The hybrid nature of the resulting space attracts tourists and visitors to the site. They come to enjoy the scenic view, to eat and to spend time in a vibrant environment. The space functions as both a connector and a destination. The symbiotic relationship here creates a circumstance where two conditions physically employ the same space, so it can be a considered to be a demonstration of a case of conjunctive symbiosis.

Relative Case Study_02: The City Centre of Salt Lake City, in Kolkata, India demonstrates an interesting circumstance of disjunctive symbiosis. Designed by architect Charles Correa, it exhibits an unconventional mixed use programming. Although it is a single development, it doesn't necessarily create physically connected forms. The project consists of a mall, plaza blocks, a Cineplex, a tower, residences and the legendary 'Kund', a traditional market place (City Centre, AmbujaNeotia, Accessed July 15, 2015. saltlake.citycentremalls.in/the-mall.aspx). The composition of its programming ranges from purely public to private. Through a symbiotic existence, it establishes a vibrant community. The contrast, color and energy of its programming give it the same vitality found on the kaleidoscopic streets. It provides a multitude of activities in pivotal locations. The resulting is a compelling mix whose individual elements don't overpower the whole. Each element remains autonomous to the extent that it doesn't dictate the nature of another, or overstep its boundaries in any way. It offers flexibility through a well-balanced occupation, thickening the public realm with its instances of the public and private. The symbiotic relationship is established through the creation of visual and functional interfaces, along with strategic positioning that allows for spatial interface between the different programs. The texture of surfaces, the use of colors and patterns and the creation of visual corridors all work as subtle tools to ignite the symbiotic relationship.

Occupation of the public realm within the designed space creates a vibrant environment. The circulation scheme within the site allows users to engage with the functions of their choice

4.2_Strategy-02_ Permeation Permeation can be described in a number of ways. The act of permeating is defined as the spreading, diffusing or passing of something through the openings, interstices or pores of something else (MerriamWebster, Web. 10 June 2016). In physics, permeation is understood as the diffusion of molecules, called permeants, through a membrane or interface. In this case, the degree of permeation is dependent on factors such as concentration, temperature and the porosity offered by the interface. The permeant will move from high concentration to low concentration across the interface depending on the porosity of the membrane it permeates. It is also affected by the temperature that excites the process. Permeability is often also utilized to describe connectivity and the extent to which urban forms permit (or restrict) movement of people or vehicles in different directions. Permeability is considered generally as a positive attribute of urban design as it facilitates navigation. Some urban forms lack permeability, for instance, those that discourage movement on foot and instead encourage longer journeys by car. In the context of this thesis, permeation is considered as the act or process of a certain program/function/activity/entity as it gradually and/or unobtrusively enters into or establishes inside another host program/function/entity. The act of permeation in architecture can be circumstantial or intentional. For example, the common phenomenon of "cafÃ© creep" or the growth of chains of commercial developments along the street can be observed as one means by which public functions finds their way into the built fabric. Similar factors such as the porosity (both physical and functional) offered by the interfacing host can allow for a more fluid and successful movement of the permeant, for the purpose of this thesis, public spaces. Similar to how a lower concentration allows for a greater degree of absorption of the permeant, in architectural terms, voids provided by the host body/ bodies of buildings will allow for easier accommodation the permeant. For example, mid-block spaces and spaces between buildings offer areas of low concentration that can be easily permeated. The physical realm of architecture is defined by boundaries. Tadao Ando (1996, 14) in Towards New Horizons in Architecture states that "Architecture has always been about boundaries; building boundaries for protection and then opening them up for movement." Thus the concept of permeation can be also explored through the manipulation of thresholds to facilitate movement, access and participation. Any architecture that encourages the strategy of mutual permeation is capable of fostering a better relationship between indoor and outdoor environments, between public and private domains, and between the built and social fabrics of the city. This would result in offering a vibrant environment.
76   

Conceptual Model_ To further explore the phenomenon of permeation, two experiments were carried out. The first one consisted of layers of meshes that were apart by varying distances. A strand of thread (a foreign entity) was then allowed to manifest through its boundaries and to permeate the mesh structure. The model further explored how thickening of the layers (increased concentration of the host) through reduced distances between the meshes began to limit the act of permeation. The conclusion was that the more compact the host is programmatically and formally, the more restrain it imposes for permeation of an additional public domain. Conversely, the more open and loose the framework of the host, the more it facilitates permeation and the thickening of the public realm. The second exploration employed a combination of vertical planes. Various apertures and cavities allowed for the passage of a foreign form (plane indicated in white) to move across it. Similar to the previous experiment, for thickening through permeation to occur, there must be opportunities for the foreign entity to grow.

Relative Case Study: The Grand Central Terminal in New York was selected as a case study because it demonstrates how the permeation of commercial markets, shops, cafes, and newsstand has proven to be beneficial in revitalizing a public hub. It contributes to the functional and infrastructural nature of its programming at the same time as it expresses the city itself. Its heterogeneous nature accommodates users' daily schedules by offering multiple functions in one space that people in transit can use. This facilitates catering to an environment where people tend to spend a lot of time engaging with the many programs and spaces, and making pit stops between their daily commute. In this scenario, the permeation manifest in
77   

thickening of the public realm stays within the host program and is not seen as a contamination since it enriches the experience of its host. It results in further accentuating its performance as a vibrant public node within the city. Such mixing of public programs is not an uncommon phenomenon in contemporary practice. Nearly all airports and terminals have a significant presence of retail and cafes as an indispensable part of their programmatic layout.

4.3_Strategy-03_ Augmentation The next theme explored is augmentation. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, augmentation refers to the act of making something greater in number, amount, and extent or to make it more intense (Merriam-Webster, Web. 11 June 2016). The resulting alteration can be made by either adding to it or modifying it to amplify its performance, or to expand, extend, raise or multiply it. It can be associated with transgressive architecture which play on the "limits" and "rules" between the expected and the unexpected in order to offer a condition that amplifies the performance of what already exist or what is being created. Michel Foucault (1977, 30) defines transgression as actions that are based on temporality and on testing limits that aim to open up boundaries rather than acting in a revolutionary or resistant way. It can be seen as a type of architectural approach that explores its own disciplinary boundaries to achieve something greater. Augmentation through the exploration of boundaries can be done in terms of building programs and examining societal norms of how spaces are perceived, designed and organized. It can also manifest itself through an unexpected hybridization of programs and spatial hierarchies. Augmentation as an architectural concept can exhibit its richness by its balance between the poles of constraint and freedom in its design approaches. Conceptual Model_ The first model to depict augmentation uses modular elements placed in a regular grid organization that is interrupted by two modules of different dimensions; these alter the grid by moving out of the grid formation. This in turn disrupts the homogenous organization and reorganizes the way the components arrange themselves thereafter. In the second experiment, transgression is explored with an irregularly folded foreign plane (shown in white) intercepting a regular arrangement of homogenous surfaces which leads to the creation of a new language of expression/formation for its host.

79   

Relative Case Study: Precedents chosen to demonstrate augmentation in architecture are the Hong Kong HSBC headquarters and the Reichstag dome in Berlin's parliament building by Norman Foster. Both express architectural augmentation through their programmatic and formal expression while capitalising on blurring the margin between the spatio-political realms of the public and private. HSBC Headquarters, Hong Kong: Banks often demonstrate slick corporate design with a controlled environment. They are often independent of the urban activities in which they are housed. However, the Hong Kong HSBC headquarters breaks the norm and augments the typical vocabulary of architecture by staging itself in unison with a public plaza that merges the urban fabric to the building's corporate function. It does so to the extent that the sloping granite plaza beneath the tower's bulging glass belly has sheltered the ad hoc tent-and-cardboard city of the Occupy movement. The building augments the formal expression of corporate bands and becomes a symbolic embodiment of political power. In this way, it rewrites the manner in which cities are built. It demonstrates how a corporate monument of this scale can actually give something back to the city at street level and thus begin a social thickening of the public realm that takes place on its premises. Internal office spaces are organized as five village-like clusters (Pagnotta, 2011). They feature double-height communal floors with rows of teller counters. A central mirrored "sun-scoop" reflects sunlight down to the atrium in a sheltered public plaza and becomes vibrant with activities on weekends.

Fig 65: Diagramming Augmentation in concept

80   

Reichstag Dome, Parliament Building, Berlin: The Reichstag dome on the Parliament building of Berlin demonstrates augmentation through a play on the limits of societal norms. Typically, parliament buildings tend to give the impression of regimental or inward-looking designs that suggest limited access to the general public. This is done in order to prevent disruption of the governmental proceeding taking place inside. However, in his design, Norman Foster plays with these preoccupations on social interaction with regards to the activities that take place within the parliament building. His design for the renovation of the parliament building added a glass dome on top of the structure. This addition of a large glass dome not only offers a 360- degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape but also allows the visitor to view the internal space containing a debating chamber in the German parliament below. The center of the dome consists of a mirrored cone that directs sunlight into the building; this further facilitates visitors' viewing of the workings of the chamber below. The dome is open to the public and is accessed by two spiraling ramps that swoops around it allowing the visitor to circulate across it (Douglass-James, 2015). This design was intended to symbolize the transparency of decision-making. The spectacle is constantly shifting and is an example of how architecture can blur boundaries and social distinctions. Here, augmentation in the design approach allows for a coherent wrapping of the public domain. The thickening of the public realm that it facilitates blurs the boundaries that demarcate its separation from the private realm.

81   

Each of the themes identified as strategies of engagement of the public and private realms demonstrate a certain degree of overlaps in its manifestation. The reason behind this is the fact that each of these themes contribute to the extension and thickening of the public realm and therefore employ different tactics to achieve a common outcome. Each theme involves the association of two or more types of functions / programs / activities that are either public or private. Together, they create a shared instance that contributes to a more enrich social life within the city. This thesis utilizes a combination of each of these themes to inject the notion of an extended public realm within a pre-existing fabric in the heart of the Financial District of Toronto.

82   

5_The Site and Context:

83   

Given the nature of the issues this thesis investigates in terms of a distinct stratification of the public realm that is exhibited in the plan and section of the contemporary city, the Financial District of Toronto became an ideal location to test its hypotheses. 5.1_Identifying components that make up the public realm on site This study attempts to locate on an urban scale the components at grade, above grade and below grade that can contribute to the thickening of the public realm. Buildings (at Grade & above Grade): The area is characterized by the predominance of towering iconic structures. These private buildings that occupy the ground surface attempt to contribute to the public realm by offering open spaces in the form of manicured plazas or ones that have publicly accessible lobby spaces. These lobbies are under 24-hour surveillance and often house art pieces as exhibits.
Fig 69: Mapping the buildings of the Financial Business District

The formal nature and sterilized condition of these spaces tends to make them intimidating and unsuitable for fostering public gatherings or activities. Some offer roof gardens, sky lobbies or elevated connecting bridges but they remain significantly private and are predominantly used only by their inhabitants. Because of their strong architectural identities and forms, these buildings demonstrate an unadaptable and rigid framework that detracts from the spontaneity of the public realm. Thresholds and boundary conditions further limit fluid movement between the private and the public realms and manifest the
Fig 70: Crystalline built form within the Financial District

polarity between them.

Streets (at Grade): Networked by some of the prominent vehicular arteries of downtown Toronto, the site offers a connecting pedestrian walkway at grade that is coupled with adjacent set-back spaces of towers, shops or edges of private buildings.

PATH Network (below Grade): Rather unique to the Financial District, this privately owned subterranean layer of publicly accessible space below the office towers acts as an extension of the city. With accessibility from the streets and from within the buildings, this network connects to most of the prime buildings in the district with a growing numner of building are attaching to it. Although it acts as an extension to street life, the fact that is remains so visually disconnected from the street and from the city above, opens it up to criticism for de-animating street life in the city. Its integration into the streets of the city above would mean that both would complement each other.

Open Space (at Grade): Inspite of the verticality that dominates the building construction within the area, it offers a number of open spaces in fragments, whether that be planned open spaces, setbacks, or privately owned plazas framed by tall towers. In addition, a number of un-programmed open spaces tucked in-between buildings hold the potential to become energized public spaces. Most of the open spaces available are hardscape urban plazas that sometimes offer seating spaces but more often than not are under-defined and appropriated according to their use. The Cloud Garden and the south lawn of the TD plaza offer the site's only two green open spaces. Their fragmented nature means that these open spaces fail to generate social density despite their potential for doing so.

Transitions (at Grade, below Grade & above Grade): Threshold or transition spaces encompass a range of conditions within the Financial District. Some threshold conditions connect the ground level with underground walkways and appear as an tiny apertures with stairs. They function like a small window that lets pedestrians disappear. At grade, transition spaces appear as mid-block spaces tucked between buildings that are seldom used by pedestrians to go across blocks. They lack definition and therefore aren't very recognizable as public spaces. Transition spaces also appear in the form of threshold conditions between the open space and built forms. In most cases they are characterized by transparent yet rigid boundary conditions that demarcate the edge of publically accessible lobbies on the premises of private buildings.

5.2_Identifying the scope of design_ Urban Scale At the urban scale, this research explores potential locations that could facilitate interventions to create a cohesive public realm through engaging the multiple layers found on site. Thus the site analysis identified and diagrammed potential mid-block connections that could be established (Figure 79) and also potential locations for the purpose of testing the thickening of the public realm (Figure 80). It also identified locations where intersections between the grade and below grade conditions could be amplified to create nodes of public activity (Figure 81).

5.3_Examining pedestrian experience offered within existing tower block conditions in the business district This thesis examined a number of tower blocks within the Financial District based on parameters such as the connection to the street, the microclimate offered within the block, the treatment of the ground plane, the nature of connectivity to the subterranean pathway networks, as well as the spatial and formal diversity it offers to the public realm. This was done to identify the nature of approaches that could be adopted to improve the existing condition and amplify the social density within such spaces.
Fig 82: Tower-block conditions to be examined

The study investigated tower block conditions that demonstrate instances of spaces left as setbacks; it included mid-block connections as well as defined plazas conditions. Elevated platforms that allow public access were also considered. The precedents exhibit that while many mid-block connections remain uncatered, several have attempted to revitalize the area through design manipulations such as elevated plazas, landscaping, street furniture's, public lobby spaces, etc. The study explores the merits and challenges of such interventions and evaluates their impact. It then uses a table to summarize key criteria Block Analysis_01

Fig 83: Study of Scotia Plaza Block

88   

While the Scotia Plaza block demonstrates a densely built footprint, a public plaza is offered by means of a shaded canopy entry area as illustrated in plan in Figure 83. The canopy offers a microclimate that benefits the pedestrian experience; however, there are no enclosed space offered to the pedestrians besides the lobby space within the building. The canopy space offers visual connection to the programs within the building, allowing a degree of visual interaction between inhabitants and pedestrian. However, the lack of sufficient public function and provision for seating limits the space from operating as an active lingering spot. Although plants and sculptures have been introduced to create points of interest, there is an absence in the formation of desirable social distance that could cater to social interaction. The ground plane is relatively undifferentiated except for the few steps the separate it from the street level. Small windows offer a connection to the underground but don't offer a habitable transition space. Block Analysis_02

Fig 84: Study of Commerce Court Block

The Commerce Court Plaza, represented in plan in Figure 84, is a significant space within the business district that comprises buildings made by influential architects such as I. M. Pei. The Plaza includes features such as a central grand fountain with bronze sculptures that leads into the central space. Sprinkled with street furniture and with the occasional presence of green, the plaza attempts to offer the pedestrian a space to sit. However, a significant micro-climate is lacking, even with the enclosed glass-cased access points to the underground. Restaurants infringe on the edges of buildings and encroach the edges of the plaza to create patio spaces. However, the intersection of the tower and ground is a space that lacks a gradual transition of scale and enclosure. The added enclosure to support public movement along the building lacks a fluid relationship with the exterior and remains only an addition to the segregated indoors and outdoors. The ground plane remains significantly undifferentiated while the outdoor plaza and the indoor
89   

spaces lack relativity. The fact that the court is tucked between buildings means that it lacks connectivity with the pedestrian movement on the street. Public functions inserted into the site are primarily in the form of restaurants; they are consumer-oriented and do not necessarily appeal to the by-standers. Block Analysis_03

Fig 85: Study of York Centre Block

In case of the York Centre Block, as illustrated in plan in Figure 85, the elevated plaza along King and University serves mainly as a setback that compliments the towering structures above. The open spaces accentuate the connection to the underground; one can observe three separate connections to the underground in close proximity to the same edge. While two of them connect to underground retail, one of the connections seems more prominent than the others; it has a glass structure that protrudes from the ground to mark the connection to the subway network. While each creates a connection, none of them offers an experiential transition threshold that would cater to being used as a lingering space. Besides this, the elevated platform offers areas of plant that appear formally as the only sort of variation of the ground condition. Otherwise, the publicly accessible ground plane remains relatively undifferentiated. The interface with the tower is distinctly sharp with plaza's edge being outlined along the perimeter of the lobby space of the tower. What is lacking is a gradual change is scale, enclosure, and a microclimate. The extremes of indoor and outdoor space are distinctly marked. The public and private nature of the programmed space and the lack of any shaded thresholds limit the possibility of habitation during the colder seasons of the year. The street edge is somewhat interrupted by the intersection of the openings to the underground; however, the fact that it is slightly elevated means that it benefits from a constant visual connection. The space lacks an experiential density because of its variety and complexity and tends to be used either by passers-by or

90   

occasionally by building inhabitants. Because of its lack of varying scales of space to inhabit, these privately owned plazas fail to offer a desirable social distance and therefore is unable to generate social interaction. Block Analysis_04

Fig 86: Study of Block of Bay Adelaide Centre

The open space within the block of the Bay and Adelaide Centre, represented in plan in Figure 86, offers a thoroughfare that is complemented by planted areas and rigidly set street furniture (benches) at the center. Although human tendency is to occupy edges and perimeters of a plaza, the design places it's seating centrally within the plaza, limiting it's the desirability for it to be used. The publicly accessible areas of the block remain open to the sky without any gradient of enclosure to offer a microclimate or a shaded space. The interaction of the plaza with the tower is demarcated by the sharp edge of the lobby space. This creates a strong definition of a boundary that does not cater to an inviting environment. Relationship between indooroutdoor spaces, public and private is very distinct. Lobby spaces appear sterile and not pedestrian-friendly. These spaces could benefit from the insertion of some other form of public programming that would create the potential for public activity to permeate from the Cloud Garden into the plaza. The open space is tucked in between the towers and doesn't speak to pedestrian activity along the street unless one is close to it. A formal gesture that would create a more active street presence could generate more life into the space. The space lacks a degree of diversity, both in spatial and programmatic terms that has led to the bland circumstance of it operating as a set-back between two iconic towers. The fact that the ground plane is undifferentiated and the connection to the PATH occurs only from within the lobby space results in a lack of visual connectivity with the level below.

Block Analysis_05

Fig 87: Study of Block of Hilton, Toronto

The Hilton Block, represented in plan in Figure 87, attempts to offer public spaces by elevating the ground plane to create useable and accessible spaces between its towers. Visual connectivity to private functions both at the grade and office spaces at the elevated level are offered. A folding staircase indicates the availability of an elevated publicly accessible space tucked between the towers. Although it incorporates green, the lack of public function and the fact that private towers encompass the area leads to a sense of private space that curtails any perception of its potential as a city space. The addition of plants at varying levels creates a desirable space during the warmer seasons but there is a lack of enclosures. While there is a manipulation in terms of vertical levels, there is still a need for a spatial hierarchy and for a microclimate. Block Analysis_06

Fig 88: Study of Richmond Adelaide Center Block

92   

The Richmond-Adelaide Centre Block, as represented in plan in Figure 88, offers a courtyard space in addition to a few public restaurant spaces in-between the towers. The courtyard is partially hidden from the street along Richmond, by means of a decorated screen. Although it creates a sense of intimacy, it also reduces its street presence for the pedestrian. The space towards Richmond Street use a variety of material on the ground. It also utilizes screens and a partial canopy to create a shaded microclimate within the area. However, the ground plane remains undifferentiated on this side of the block (along Richmond St). The intersection of the tower and the ground plane lacks a gradual transition or gradient that could create a more fluid transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. The perimeter of the courtyard is marked by the sharp edge of private lobby spaces that do not encourage pedestrian participation. Restaurants tend to encroach and ward off spaces within the block for their private uses, thereby preventing the thoroughfare from functioning well as a city space. On the other edge towards Adelaide Street, the tower mimics the Miesian tower blocks of the Toronto-Dominion Centre. All offer transparent, slightly recessed lobby spaces above which dark towers rise. The plaza across from the towers are elevated above the ground. They offer an undifferentiated, bland plaza; their benches are placed at sizable intervals so they do not offer social interaction. From the street level, stairs lead to a partially depressed plaza-like space that has blank walls and a door to allow access to the underground. In spite of this grand gesture of making the connection to the underground noticeable, the depressed part of the plaza fails to provide visual connectivity to the public functions below and only offers signage. The plaza space is open to sky and does not provide varying scales of enclosures of spatial conditions to invite and retain pedestrian participation. The views offered to the pedestrians are primarily private offices and therefore do not cater an engaging environment. Block Analysis_07

Fig 89: Study of Block at 150 King W

The Block at 150 King West, as represented in plan in Figure 89, exhibits typical point connection of the tower and the ground plane with its sculptural glass tower being set back from the street in a spacious plaza condition. Although it offers visibility of the ground floor level public lobby, the formal expression of the lobby
93   

with its limited seating doesn't produce an inviting public space. In terms of a human-scale canopy, the building begins to mimic its neighbour on the other side of Adelaide St: it offers a glass canopy over extended areas of the block. Similar canopy space with a green roof is found at the York and Pearl intersection that covers the restaurant area and has patio space adjacent to it. However, the canopy on the King and University side, contributes minimally to offering a microclimate. Although the undifferentiated plaza space adds to the area of the sidewalk, its failure to provide any sort of microclimate limits it from being a lingering spot. Green and sculptures are added in an attempt to create points of interest. However, a lack of public interest on this end of the block limits it from becoming a lingering space. The connections to the underground appear as awkward punctures hidden behind the folds of the towering form and fail to connect it to the life of the street. Block Analysis_08

Fig 90: Study of the BMO block

In comparison to some of the other examples, the BMO Block, as represented in plan in Figure 90, achieves to a certain extent more spatial diversity than the others. It does this through its manipulation of the ground level and by its incorporation of certain public programs within its perimeter. It creates a partially open and partially framed space within its block that attempts to function as a publicly accessible space. It remains porous while allow for a certain degree of enclosure to generate a sense of place. Towards King Street, the public space offered seems somewhat park-like with its incorporation of green and sitting areas at split levels; it offers the possibility of moving retail functions into interior spaces. While it attains a certain desirability as a lingering space, its location as well as the varying gradient of its enclosure limits diverse spatial experiences and usability during colder seasons. The 9 to 5 nature of activities in the area also leads to a reduced ability of the programmatic mix to create vitality after office hours. The public plaza on the side of Adelaide Street appears more retail in nature. The articulation of the plaza accommodates both visibility and movement at
94   

the ground, below-ground and above- ground levels. The frame-like canopy gives the notion of an intimate space even when it remains open to sky. Surrounding patio spaces allow activities to spill out to the street and thereby tend to vitalize the space. The space could benefit from providing more spatial hierarchy in terms of more desirable social distances and from an extended threshold that would facilitate lingering and social interaction. The open partially green space of the BMO block stands at close proximity to the open spaces of the Toronto Dominion Centre Block. This facilitates the opportunity for these space, if designed to work in cohesion and regenerate each other in the process. Beside the public spaces along King Street, the remaining spaces offered by the BMO block appear as edge treatment of the structures that stand on it. The block however makes an effort to amplify user interface. Block Analysis_09

Fig 91: Study of the TD Tower block

The Toronto-Dominion Centre Tower Block, as represented in plan in Figure 91, becomes an ideal demonstration. A significant amount of the space of the block has been defined as a plaza space, which serves more to complement the sculptural towers than to allow it to serve as an active public space. The interface of the tower and ground plane is not supported by a gradual transition. Recessed lobby spaces were created to provide a shaded canopy space. However, the larger extent of the plaza remains open and undifferentiated except for the podiums that are responsive to the changing levels of the street that encompasses them. All forms of public functions such as retail have been suppressed below the ground except for the public banking pavilion and a restaurant on the plaza, both of which are encased in a dark screen and appear private in nature. The presence of the space at street level gives the impression that it is a setback created primarily to offer a viewing of the iconic towers and not so much as a pedestrian-friendly environment or community space. Throughout the block, varying degrees of plantations offer green spaces
95   

and occasional benches. However, the fact that they are rigidly placed in strategic locations means that they don't always accord with desirable social distances. They therefore fail to instigate social interaction. There is also a disconnect between the different stratified levels, the PATH network, the ground plane and the office spaces above. Aside from the sterile monolithic lobby spaces, there is limited visibility of other functions within the block. Small openings like windows allow foot traffic on the ground plane to disappear below grade and the transition between the levels is not celebrated.

Summary The selected blocks span from vaguely defined plazas intended to complement the built forms of their blocks to ones that adopt various approaches to addressing a pedestrian- friendly environment. Some typical concerns that surface include a lack of spatial diversity both in terms of varying scales and hierarchy of spaces, as well as in terms of varying microclimates. Inarticulated threshold conditions fail to create fluid transitions between open, shaded, semi-enclosed and enclosed spaces. This further limits the generation of an experiential density that vibrant public spaces should offer. The distinct separation of the public and the private that is emphasized by the separation of the indoor and outdoor further catalyzes the notion of segregation and reduces the legibility of these spaces as active parts of the public realm. Often a no-man's land condition is generated that leads to an increased sense of placelessness. There is a disinclination to use the space and hence its potential for contributing to social interactions is severely limited. Many of these designed spaces within the block tend to be too wide to benefit from desirable social distances that can instigate interest or initiate interaction. The edges of such plazas on blocks are defined by the private lobbies of the towers. Offering third spaces between these threshold conditions can further blur the polarity between public and private spaces. The lack of a formal diversity within these spaces means that they fail to trigger interest and curiosity in the pedestrian; he or she is more inclined to use it use it as a thoroughfare rather than as a space for lingering. Often different areas within the same block stay disconnected, leading to the creation of isolated islands that function as residual spaces. Allowing them to be both physically and visually connected would allow them to operate as a connective tissue that functions as one continuous space. In cases where outdoor spaces within the block offer street furniture and benches, they tend not to feature desirable social distances but rather to look into bland open spaces as well as away from each other. Consequently, they fail to encourage social gatherings. The ground plane, more than often, remains undifferentiated. In the few cases where they are elevated or depressed, they are not supported by significant
96   

programming or visually connected to the functions below and above ground. Connections to the PATH network in most cases occur through small apertures. These openings fail to establish a significant sense of continuity to allow the two levels to be perceived as one whole continuous public network. The public parts of these private spaces demonstrate a rigid, closed system that restricts the possibilities of their use. The nature of work spaces in contemporary society is changing and becoming more flexible while these shared city spaces remains un-adaptable and segregated. Conception of these spaces must allow multiple uses of possibilities of use, in terms of activities and spatial conditions and of juxtaposition of programs and spaces. Interconnected spaces need to weave between the layers of public spaces offered below and above ground to speak back to the life of the city that occurs predominantly on the ground plane. Through reconfiguration of spaces, interventions can aim to create permeable boundaries and flexible relationships between the public and private even as they offer fluid hierarchies and diversity to spatial environments. The needs of intimate spaces on smaller ground could be accommodated and grounds could be made adaptable to support larger gatherings. Spaces within such block conditions need to be able to facilitate the various natures of users of the space, that is, inhabitants, visitors, by-standers and by-passers.

5.4_Site of Exploration_ Block of the Toronto Dominion Centre Having explored a number of blocks conditions within the financial district, this research focused on a single block. The intention here was to test how to extend and re-engage the public realm within underutilized tower blocks. The TD Tower block was chosen as the site of exploration. Mies's Modernist towers sit on a carefully manicured controlled landscape that he created by burying the chaos of shops and street activity. The plaza serves as a preparation space for the towers which don't necessarily offer a habitable space for pedestrian or social gatherings. All these factors contributed to the site selection.

6_Design Proposal The purpose of the research is to identify the possibilities of a strengthened public network and redefine the ways public and private domains can thicken the public realm. This proposal advocates that manipulating the ground plane of existing undifferentiated and underutilized civic surfaces within blocks can add a new layer of public activity to a city core that is increasingly de-animated. It aims to repair the compromised pedestrian experience and improve the inconsistent public realm that it currently offers. The urban fabric in contemporary cities exhibits fragments of open spaces in the form of sidewalks, setbacks, mid-block spaces, and open-to-public privatized plazas that comprise the civic surface offered within the city. Inspite of being significant in quantity, they lack the qualities of a desirable nodal conditions for public participation and engagement. The figure below compares the same area of the city fabric within Toronto and Venice. The purpose was to illustrate how civic surfaces offered to pedestrians within city cores such as Toronto are distributed in a manner that is not conducive to the creation of a square-like environment or node where one could linger or one which could serve as a public destination. In addition the lack of definition and functional diversity offered within such city spaces further limit them in terms of public occupation.

6.1_Design Intent In the case of the chosen site, the block offers two significantly large open spaces that remain relatively static. It is partially due to the absence of an intimate scale of public occupation that supports an appropriate social distance for interaction. The large span of open spaces without any supporting public function or framework for public activities to enfold deprives it from being used extensively, allowing the private nature of its office function to dominate and dictate the use of the open space. While the green space to the south becomes rather vibrant during lunch hours during summer, the harsher seasons of the year render it empty.

King St W

At the level of the block, the proposal attempts to offer inviting lingering spaces that not only facilitate moments of pause but also create an experiential thoroughfare for pedestrians befitting to a three dimensional square environment. For this to be accomplished, varying spatial conditions that accommodate the needs of the different seasons will be created. A combination of spaces that alter between indoor and outdoor spaces will be established. Juxtapositions of public and public-private shared functions and spaces will be created that will offer different possibilities of use to both pedestrians and block inhabitants. The intimate scale of diverse activities and functions created within the site will be used to support small scale intimate events and regular nature of activities simultaneously. An interweaving circulation complementing the created spaces will accommodate continuity within the different activity spaces, allowing the provision for them to function as

101   

a continuous network of spaces that functions as one space to support larger events (as illustrated in Figure 96 and 97). As a result, a myriad of possibilities for social interaction and multifarious activities will be created within the block. The pattern of use aims to define the temporal character of the spaces designed. The massive scale of the undefined or under-defined spaces offered within the blocks will thus be broken down to create a number of juxtaposing interior and exterior environments that can house various programs. This will allow giving the existing ground plane a new definition through more interactive means of use. Spaces for public use will be allowed to grow symbiotically on an otherwise private site, opening it up for public use and thereby allow for greater public participation.

At the level of the street, the intervention aims to capitalize on the intricate underground network tracing the site to extend on the thickening of the ground plane. The intervention attempts to create a gradient between public street activities and the suppressed underground with the intention of drawing people into the block. It emphasizes both physical and visual connectivity and continuity to engage a relationship between the two layers of public movement, the ground and the PATH network, whilst extending an interconnected aboveground network. The thickened ground will work to extend the ground without generating the typical stratification that is currently found in the parallel layers of the city. This is illustrated in Figure 98.

At the scale of the building, the intervention aims to recreate a relatable human scale at intersections of built forms and urban social fabrics; these will allow architecture to re-engage with the public realm through its demonstration of a habitable environment at its threshold (transition space). The current circumstance on site displays a condition where there is a distinct separation between the indoor and outdoor spaces. The only attempts to create a gradual transition through the threshold is offered by the recessed lobby. It however remains de-animated as the peripheral condition for the sterile transparent lobby space edged by the shadow line of the building extent above. Furthermore, the large scale of the towering structures on site generates a disproportionate relationship with the human scale at ground which further accentuates an uncomfortable transitional condition for the pedestrians and visitors on site.

Through this resulting thickened ground, the research advocates creating a spatial condition that occupies the void on site creating a number of networked public platforms that vary in their degree of enclosure, moving between indoor, semi-outdoor and outdoor spaces. To minimize the polarity between the indoor (private) and outdoor (public) space, the proposal distributes the added functional spaces between and around the existing towers and ties it through circulation. This is done to facilitate not just a generous gradient between indoor and outdoor but to activate a flux to be created between them. The flux is activated and energized as one moves between indoor and outdoor environments continuously to go from one proposed space to the next.

Fig 100: Design intent of a thickened threshold condition

The intervention recalls Christine McCarthy (2005, 116) notions of interiority and exteriority versus inside and outside. The continuous network of public spaces created through the intervention allows an individual to perceive his location in terms of interiority and exteriority which is based on his distance from the space he passed and his proximity to the next space he is approaching. This eliminates the binary opposition that typically exists between the indoor and outdoor spaces on site where once one walks out of the internalized space, he or she is completely removed into the other extreme of the offered environment, the large outdoor space. Producing the notions of interiority and exteriority through the constant juxtaposition of enclosed, open and semi-enclosed circulation space, a sense of flexibility, mobility and porosity is created within the site that allows the user to choose the nature of space or activity he wants to participate or spend time in. This also allows retaining a constant reconnection with the city space outside as one moves in and
105   

out as they move from one programmed space to the next instead. Manipulation of transitional threshold further blurs the separation in the conception of the public and private realm allowing an interrelationship between the two as public spaces permeate into a private environment. In addition, flexible openings (use of folded doors) further allows the enclosed spaces to become one with the semi-outdoor circulation connecting it. This administers spaces as points of transition or a continuation of a journey, and the melting point of interface between two entities. Notions of interiority and exteriority is not only explored in the articulation of threshold but also in section to ensure a continuity of the public realm.

Proposal: Thickened Threshold Fig 101: Thickening the threshold condition of site

Thus, a thickened public landscape needs to be created that extends, reinvigorates, and revitalizes experiences within the public realm. This in turn will establish an activated coexistence and mediation between the public-private, indoor-outdoor, built and social fabrics of the city. The site is characterized by a corporate monoculture which limits the duration of user occupation strictly around office hours.

106   

The site observes most participation as people rush into and out of office hours and somewhat during lunch hours. The undifferentiated space however fails to retain users after office hours. With the aim to extend user hours beyond office hours and user groups beyond just the inhabitants of the tower, the intervention begins to differentiate the ground to create eventful spaces through the accommodation of multiplicity of use and spatial conditions.

6.2_Locating Area of Intervention on Site The existing pedestrian movement patterns on site were first explored to identify locations for interventions to weave alternate routes of travel and create pedestrian-friendly environments. The TD Tower block offers two large spans of open spaces with the one towards Wellington Street offering a green space. Although inviting during the summer season, the space remains relatively vacant during colder seasons, partially because it is not supported by shaded or semi-enclosed seating areas at its intersection with the tower. Pedestrian movement through the block is primarily characterized by users of the buildings accessing the towers, by pedestrians taking the shortest route across the site from one end to another and by users moving between the ground and the underground. Movement between levels happens to be one of the key generators of pedestrian activity on site and forms the nodal points of their movement. However, it is not supported by a space where one could linger.

 

Fig 103: Mapping existing pattern of movement on site and connections to the underground path network

107   

Learning from the pattern of movement on site, a primary thoroughfare has been identified that is most frequented in terms of pedestrian movement and offers easy access to the key nodes within the block such as the underground, green spaces and the towers. Based on it areas of intervention have been located for thickening of the ground to manifest. It has been ensured that the areas for intervention are responsive to the path of the identified thoroughfare, offering interstitial spaces along the route. An attempt has been made to offer the pedestrian a variety of spatial conditions and options for routes of travel. It is expected that this in turn will present possibilities of informal encounters. For the areas of intervention that are tied to nodal locations that connect between levels, public platforms have been offered in tension with areas where movement is usually slower (such as stairs). The intention is that it would encourage passive engagement and to draw people to newly created in-between lingering spaces.

 

Fig 104: Locating Areas for design intervention to extend the public realm

Operating through the media of the built environment and the open spaces found on site, this project aims to create a desirable framework for the public realm that will instigate engagement, social activity, public interaction, and exchange. This proposal attempts to strengthen the role of the public space in the Financial District by adding on to the infrastructure of the existing public realm. Its goal is to make the district more than just an aggregate of skyscrapers and streets and to offer a mid-level datum that will extend urban life along a new dimension. The intervention intends to create a hierarchy of walkable spaces that will contribute to the enhancement of the pedestrian experience. Alternate routes of travel are proposed that will move between different degrees of interiority and exteriority and between different levels. The pedestrian, as well as the inhabitants, will be offered alternate routes for flowing through the site that will let them choreograph their
108   

movements and will increase possibilities of chance encounters. The intervention will cater the existing circulation with various functional spaces based on the identified location to activate an engaging and interesting interface.

6.3_Application of Design Strategies Having identified the locations for the intervention to create an extended public network, the research revisits themes that were previously explored as means to deal with how the public realm can engage with the designed space. The themes of symbiosis, permeation and augmentation are utilized to create the instances discussed. Each of the three strategies aid in producing an environment of activated coexistence that diffuses polarity between public-private, built-unbuilt, inside-outside, and ground and between levels.

Strategy_01: Symbiosis Symbiosis The first strategy of symbiosis begins to extend the perimeter condition to re-engage pedestrian movement. The goal is to open up multiple possibilities of access and to create a hierarchy of walkable spaces as a network of public surfaces; these will grow from the edge into the block, along and into the surfaces of existing structures symbiotically fusing with what stands on site. Civic activities of the street grow within the existing block through polyvalent spaces that attach to and latch onto transition spaces between levels and between interior and exterior environments. Symbiosis as a strategy reveals and extends social information of public spaces, transforming the area of its manifestation into an inside-out circumstance that through its operation will create permeability. Symbiosis creates a coupling that begins to contribute to enhance the experience within the growing public networks. It also energizes areas of the host where they interface and mutually shares certain amenities such as elevator spaces, etc.
109

Attach & Extend

Strategy_02: Permeation Permeation The second strategy of permeation involves allowing points of public interest (spaces for public activities) to seep into spaces within the host. This disturbs the mono-functionality that currently marks the site. Through the operation of this strategy, certain spaces within the tower are occupied to allow some civic spaces to permeate buildings to thus create shared instances between the public and the private realms. Shared spaces include offering collaborative work spaces, common lounge spaces etc, where both the public and private realm can benefit from the intervention. Thus the strategy is translated into one of amalgamation and engagement that vitalizes the host as well the newly created public spaces. This further opens up the possibility for events and activities to extend and spill-out between indoor and outdoor spaces, thereby creating permeable and fluid boundaries that offer civic legibility as they move between designed space and the city. The proposed public network permeating into and around the building also begins to offer inhabitants of the office spaces to take alternate and more interesting routes to go to the ground level instead of just using the internalized elevator down. This increases the potentiality of interaction between the inhabitants and the visitor.

Infill & Occupy

At the intersection of the below and at-grade levels, the nature of activities exhibited by each level are also allowed to permeate in and out of their intersection to inhabit the folds and crevices of the differentiated ground. This not only facilitates a reconnection between the stratified layers of the city but also increases visual and physically connectivity. It recreates the opportunity for these separate layers to function as one continuous city space. Allowing such an intersection within the block encourages infiltration of more pedestrians into the site, and therefore extending the street experience within the block, while activating the otherwise muted block. An intervention that is instigated by notions of permeation between two realm, public and private, creates opportunity for establishing a gradient between what operates as two distinctly separate realms when it comes to its operation.
110   

Strategy_03: Augmentation Augmentation The third strategy of augmentation is employed to sculpt a differentiated ground plane to expose connections to the underground and to homogenize the intersection of the stratified layers of movement on site. The peeling open of the ground plane through its manipulated folds create a habitable threshold of public interaction and an eventful activated space. The dispersed small openings connecting to the underground are gathered into four key locations (identified by the circulation patterns on site) and exaggerated in terms of both their visual and physical connection. They are then supported by attaching lingering spaces and public platforms. Breaking away from existing spatial organization, this strategy allows for the re-imagining of the interface of the levels and the public and private domains in a way that emphasizes continuation instead of segregation. Consistency in civic legibility is created, as well as physical cohesion between what currently operate as separate strata's of movement. The openings become a space of celebration and a destination around which the thickening of the public realm operates. Through these three different strategies, this proposal intends to enhance experience for the inhabitants, visitors, and drifters

Reveal & Reconnect

6.4_ Proposal: This proposal employs the three strategies discussed to manipulate the ground to create a differentiated plane of movement. This plane will be thickened experientially by offering varying scales and hierarchy of spaces exhibiting different degrees of enclosure. This will allow the pedestrian to not only choreograph his pattern of movement across the space but also to linger in spaces. The multiplicity of options and view of spaces and activities occurring concurrently begin to generate a three dimensional square-like environment as they are offered across the section of the block. Operating sectionally to overcome stratification between levels, the ground plane is folded in a way that allows for opening up the subterranean network below while

111   

facilitating movement at grade. The design intervention introduces an elevated pedestrian network in conjunction with the now-unified ground and below ground levels. It is done in a way that creates a continuous interwoven network of thickened ground that is not restricted by a single datum. The datum of the ground molds itself as the continuous public spaces within the network unfold and each new level begins to take on the character of the ground as one moves through it. Visual connectivity is also given emphasis alongside physical continuity of movement. Visual connectivity induces the desire to move through the space while the physical continuity facilitates it. Thus the proposal overcomes the typical stratification within parallel levels of the city through its operation within the context of the block.

Considering the primary arteries of pedestrian movement on site, at grade and in PATH network, the proposal makes four openings in and along the identified locations of intervention. The opening to the northwest of the site is envisioned as the primary nodal connection and the growing spine of the entire network (shown as 1 in Fig 111). It is adorned with multiple public platforms as urban patios to function as lingering spaces. The openings to the east and south attempt to connect the plinth of the block back to the street level while establishing a visual and physical connection to the PATH (shown as 2 and 4 in Fig. 111). The existing internalized connection to the PATH along Design Exchange Gallery is accentuated to vitalize a node in the otherwise de-animated space between the towers (shown as 3 in Fig 111). The following schematic sections illustrate the four connections to the underground and identify the thickened ground plane.

The augmented ground proposed by the intervention takes up spaces within the block and in-between the towers. The manipulation of the ground begins to create platforms that host flexible spaces for public activities and functions. The nature of the proposed program includes co-working spaces, workshop areas, lounges, extended demonstration areas for the design exchange, interactive media spaces, etc. Permeation of such programming is intended to provide opportunities for the intermingling between the two segments of the public, the pedestrian and the inhabitants. Thus strengthening the public realm on site by creating opportunities for social interaction. The created spaces offer flexibility and reconfigurability which makes it adaptable to user needs.

Figure 112 illustrates how the proposal permeates into the voids of the site (such as spaces between and around the building). It establishes a symbiotic relationship with the existing structures, partially infiltrating into areas of the existing to further encourage an interface between the private and newly created sharable public spaces.

Fig 112: Permeation of intervention on site

114   

In order to allow the intervention to exhibit characteristics of squares, the entire area of the intervention is conceived as a collection of nodes or squares, each of which offers a different environment. With an intent to inject the characteristics of squares, each exhibiting similar yet a unique set of features at its disposal, each section of the intervention is identified by the following-the retail node, the cultural node, collaboration node, entertainment node and green node. The character of each node is defined by the type of activities that transpire in that space. For example, the entertainment node offers spaces that encourage participation. Activities open to a diverse range of age groups and masses are offered creating greater potential for both active and passive engagement, hoping to draw more people into them. This node includes spaces such as public podiums, interactive media spaces, event spaces etc. It is located around the more prominent opening to the PATH, to allow it to co-function as an amphitheatre during off-peak hours for informal performances or movie projections. Conversely, the green node located on the south of site along the green lawns, make minimum intervention, prioritizing open spaces (urban patios and outdoor lunch rooms) as complementary spaces to the green expanse. It includes a wellness center that can function as a space for meditation, hosting yoga classes, etc., activities that can benefit from its proximity to nature. Both a physical and visual link is maintained between these node conditions to draw people from one node to the next. Figure 113 illustrates the considered programs for each of these nodes.

Fig 113: Programmatic distribution on site

115   

The new spaces for public activities are further energized by the establishment of a symbiotic relationship between the networked circulation and the loosely programmed spaces along it. This enables the user to choose between just passing through, lingering or participating in the programmed space. Multiple circulation options contribute to encourage participation and to facilitate activities without being over prescriptive. Figure 114 illustrates how the created public network fuses circulation and programmable space. This is facilitated by the creation of fluid thresholds that morph an area that identifies both as part of the indoor as well as outdoor space. Threshold conditions further become flexible with the use of folded glass doors that allow indoor and outdoor spaces to merge into one large space based on the spatial needs and favourable environment. Thickening is further explored by retaining a visual connectivity from one node to the next by hinting the presence of activity occurring at the next.

In addition to the lack of a hierarchy of scale of spaces in plan and section, the research also critiques the absence of a range of spatial variety within the block. To address this, the augmented ground of permeating public functions is complemented with a morphing layer of canopy that begins to respond to the need of offering varying degrees of openness and enclosure, height, light and shade. This not only thickens the site in terms of the spatial conditions offered by also sets out a diverse range of options for the user to choose from based on his preference.
116   

A folded canopy, reflecting the geometry of the folding ground latches and attaches itself symbiotically to the existing built-fabric, its host. The panels that comprise the folding roof offer different degrees of porosity to respond to the varying needs of the activity that transpires below. It is also a response that is based on the conditions of its location. For example in places where the canopy covers an opening to the subterranean, the geometry of its frame weaves open to maximize the amount of light that penetrates in. Similarly, in locations such as tighter inbetween spaces of the towers or semi-outdoor patio spaces, the porosity increases, allowing a naturall-lit environment. Conversely, for areas of programmed activities, the porosity decrease, allowing a solid roof to create lighting conditions more desirable for the activity it houses within.

Canopy offering varying spatial conditions  Symbiosis - Permeation - Augmentation

Fig 115: Diagramming Tactic_03

The canopy is also used as a tool that begins to mimics the fine-grain faÃ§ade treatment of its host. It does so through the open (glass) faces and through the ribs of its solid panels. The edges of the roof allow a gradual gradient from light to shade. This adds dynamism and intrigue into the space, while the varying folds create varying scales (heights) of spaces for the programs it encompasses. The user is allowed to choose between environments such as sitting in the shade, in the light or in the open. In places, the treatment of the roof panels attempts to create lighting conditions that is reminiscent of the environment offered by foliage in a forest. A set of experiments to determine the nature of composition of the roof panels were explored (as can be found in the appendix). The figure below shows an attempt to how panels of different porosity would work together.

Fig 116: Exploring varying lighting conditions through the roof canopy

117   

Fig 117: Exploring ideas of a folded canopy on a study model

The folding nature of the canopy continues into the faÃ§ade treatment as a tactic to conceal the primary structure. It also aids to accentuate the hierarchy of scale offered by the new spaces. Not only does the folded skin facilitate a formal expression that is distinctly different from the one on site, the folds also allow creating varying sense of height, expressed through the paneling of the columns, which now display a variety by appearing as small, medium and large in response to the scale of space that is encompassed by it. This in turn aids to provide legibility to users about the spaces that they are in. The folded wrapping that molds the columns and the roof helps relate the proposal to human scale and also adds tension between indoor-outdoor spaces as surfaces fold and morph going from the interior to the exterior. The folds offer bystanders moments of pause by allowing their surfaces to be used for sitting and leaning. Thus the roof canopy along with the folding panels of the structure and adds a degree of visual orientation, dynamism and complexity to the space, creating an interesting interfaces.

In Biophilic Design: The Theory, Science and Practice of Bringing Buildings to Life (2011, 63), Kellert, R. Stephen, Heerwagen, J and Mador, M quote Nikos A. Salingaros (2006) who suggests that, "Human beings connect physiologically and psychologically to structures embodying organized complexity more strongly than to environments that are either too plain, or present disorganized complexity." Thus it can be inferred that to establish a public framework on a site that is characterized by a very regular nature of formal expression, the creation of a distinct formal diversity is a key strategy in reclaiming the public domain as a highly-privatized one. This incorporation of formal complexity does not blur the intention of civic legibility. In his book, "Human Aspects of Urban Form", Amos Rapoport (1977, 207) points out that,
"An interest in complexity, richness and perceptual opulence follows from the proposed distinction between perception and cognition. The purpose of cognition is to clarify the environment by simplifying it to schemata and by concentrating on limited parts of it. Perceptual experience through the senses is one of richness and complexity. No matter how much of the environment one tunes out, the direct experience is always much richer than any memory or schema...While people want to be oriented and to understand a city cognitively, they also wish to experience its complexity. From this perspective, then, there is no conflict between a stress on clarity and legibility in the city (e.g., Lynch 1960) and the desire for complexity (e.g. Rapoport and Kantor 1967). Not only are they not mutually exclusive, they are in fact complementary: one is a matter of cognition, the other of perception. On a larger scale, clarity is needed; on a smaller, complexity." (208)

The proposal utilizes a folded plane geometry to achieve diversity in form and hierarchy of space on a site that is strictly marked homogenous orthogonal surfaces. The folded geometry facilitates the creation of a thickened ground by allowing folds to function as connectors and platforms to accommodate programs.

The existing condition exhibits an undifferentiated ground that remains completely visually disconnected from the subterranean pathway and lacks a transitional threshold at the intersection of the tower and the ground.

As demonstrated by segments of the proposed section A-A and section B-B, the intervention primarily begins to augment the ground plane to first establish a fluid visual and physical connection to the public network concealed below the site. The formal expression of the intervention begins to give out information about the public functions that now manifest on site. The ground morphs from the sidewalk, drawing pedestrians into the outdoor atrium that is created at the opening of the ground. The undifferentiated ground plane is transformed into a folding levels of urban podiums that look onto each other, the activities of the street as well the functions of the ground below. Thus a dynamic stage for the onlookers. The symbiotically growing structure transforms the perimeter to block relationship by offering spatial diversity and inviting microclimates within the block. Manipulation of the ground further allows activities below the ground to begin to permeate above ground, creating a more consistent relationship between the pre-existing, previously segregated levels. The thickened public domain spans and infills the spaces between the towers, breaking down the narrowness ratio and allowing for human-scaled spaces to be generated. The extending public spaces permeate into the buildings through creation to fluid indoor outdoor spaces that can be shared by both pedestrians, inhabitants and visitors. The public platforms that create the three-dimensional squareenvironment within the site change in scale to create opening to light up the perforation of the ground. The public realm on site is amplified by re-thinking the norms of how public spaces are perceived, designed and organized within typical corporate environments.

The site offers two hardscaped plazas to the north, one along Bay Street and another along King. Both remain undifferentiated and disconnected from the activities of the PATH network below.. The lack of a spatial environment for one to linger along with the lack of visual connection to the activities of the design exchange gallery contributes to the absence of public vitality. As illustrated in the segment of section C-C, augmenting the ground begins to reveal and reconnect the public and private through a thickened public threshold. Instead of a sharp boundary separating the indoor and outdoor environments, spaces for public activities are distributed three-dimensionally to create a constant flux between the interior and exterior environment. This leads to not only establishing a gradient in threshold condition but also ensures that the user constantly reconnects to the city space as they move from one programmed space to the next. Thus blurring the preconceived polarity between indoor-outdoor and publicprivate. The connecting elevated level joins the different sections of the intervention, generating a secondary thoroughfare that allows one to go across the entire block through the intervention. The network offers three elevated fore-courts to the towers at each end of the intervention to ensure a certain degree of participation as well as to create melting points of shared access between the private environment and the created public spaces. Visual and physical connectivity is retained throughout the section of the intervention as the ground folds and molds up. In the case of the plaza along Bay street, the intervention establishes a symbiotic relationship with the design exchange gallery, exposing a connection along Bay. This allows revealing one of the few public functions at grade on the site. Catered with a cafÃ© the intervention at this corner begins to re-orient pedestrians to engage with the space. A connection to the PATH network is also established along Bay street for further extend the corner as a desirable node. An elevated network is established as a pedestrian bridge connects area of the resource center, making the roof of the pavillion accessible.Circulation permeates into and around the edge of the tower to blur the boundaries of the public and the private space, coupling the two in a way that helps the whole space gain momentum

Section E-E demonstrates how the intervention operates around the TD pavilion block. It reimagines and amplifies the spatial condition currently offered by the tucked-in low height structure that connects the pavilion block and the two towers behind it. The intervention allow the public realm to symbiotically grow along the edges of the pavilion with public functions such as a restaurant and workshop areas. The spaces can in turn function and perform as one space for events that are hosted by the design exchange gallery. The roof of the pavilion is made accessible by the intervention, injecting it with the potentiality of becoming a viewing platform for experiencing the iconic structures presented around it. Further along the edge of the street the bus stop is included as a part of the intervention. It follows the same formal language to create a shaded area complemented with green planters, creating a small microclimate of its own. The intent was to use it as a hint of what develops within the block.

Currently on site, a narrow passage has been formed between the TD bank pavilion and the tower that was previously the stock exchange. While the tower houses the seeming-to-be-public design exchange resource center and a gallery, it remains very inwardly oriented. A low height structure, tucked behind the pavilion block connects it to the two towers adjacent to it. However, it remains fairly hidden from the public eye and therefore gains a private demeanor, lacking public participation. The connecting block also houses an internalized connection to the PATH network which is seemingly the most prominent one on site. Unfortunately the lack of visual connectivity to the surroundings, it becomes limited in public vitality and therefore doesn't contribute much to the public realm on site. The design intervention attempts to infiltrate in this in-between space and re-imagine the spaces within it. It augments the boundary condition of gallery to create a more exciting thoroughfare that interweaves with the gallery space, increasing potentiality of participation in the space. The existing block is re-thought and the opening to the parallel level below is accentuated for create the conditions of a node. Public functions such as a cafÃ©, a convenience store, and a souvenir shop are allowed to seep in and around the established thoroughfare. This further intensifies the public realm, re-orienting pedestrians to traverse through the space and engage with it. The ground is further manipulated and folded up to attach and provide more platforms to host public activity spaces such as areas for collaborative works space, studio and demonstration areas that attach and extend the office spaces and areas of the resource center above. The intervention symbiotically grows around the crevices and voids of the existing to create its network and attach on to the remaining of the intervention on site to maintain its continuity of circulation. A connection to the office spaces creates opportunity for the inhabitants to be offered an alternatively route to go down instead of just taking the elevator. This facilitates greater degree of interface between the private and the public realms catering to increased possibility of social interaction between users of participants of the space.

Segments of the sections F-F and G-G demonstrate the discussed thoroughfare that grows from the sidewalk along Bay and spines through the block. The thoroughfare is coupled with public platforms and engaging spaces are offered as one progresses through it. Connections to the subterranean network and the resource center above are established to amplify the public nature of what exists on site. The folding geometry of the manipulated ground ensures the each level maintains a visual and a physically connectivity. This aids in producing the thickening of the public realm as a diverse nature of activities are allowed to take simultaneously in any given area of the proposal.

7.0_Continuing the Dialogue

Fig 165: The ground as the public domain

Where current architectural practice continues to produce designs of aesthetically pleasing towers with identically stacked floors, a distinct separation between the built environment and the life occurring on the surface of the city persists. Modernism's continued influence on contemporary architecture causes it to treat architecture as an object that defines the public spaces around it. This limits the built form from accommodating opportunities of pedestrian engagement and generating a variety of public activities to catalyze social interaction. The dominance of private enterprise along with the contemporary reality of the multiplied ground, which facilitates vehicular movement primarily, further tends to generate a stratification of the civic life within urban spaces. Through research and a design project, this thesis aimed to instigate a discourse about contemporary architecture's potential in revitalizing the public domain within urban spaces. The thesis posited that there is a need to reinstate and re-define public spaces, and bring them to the forefront in the form of a thickened ground condition that constantly reconnects and amplifies pedestrian experience. It called for a new language
162

of coexistence between the public and private through an interweaving of urban civic functions at their interfaces. It explored how the parallel networks within the city such as the subterranean PATH network or other forms of public network can begin to meet at-grade public amenities repeatedly to avoid segregation and facilitate a continuous transition between these layers of circulation. Employing multi-scalar strategies, the proposal attempted to relink the built environment to the social realm. To test how architecture articulates the existing built environment in the creation of vibrant social spaces, under-designed or under-used spaces from within the urban centre of Toronto were analyzed. This was done to re-imagine them in ways that would not only regenerate public participation within them but would also result in energizing the existing buildings and programs on site. Based on precedent studies, design strategies were developed and included augmentation, permeation and symbiosis. Their combination was used to test how altering the spatial and social conditions within an existing block can open up new possibilities for public engagement. The Toronto Dominion Centre tower block, one of the largest and most iconic blocks within the Financial District was chosen to test the hypothesis. Designed by Mies Van der Rohe, the block offers large spans of open plaza spaces that the proposal manipulated to create an extended multi-layered public space network. This multi-layered network intended to integrate walkways, sidewalks, above and below grade connections, through the creation of a thickened ground. It also provided a variety of publically accessible spaces and staged multiple sequence of movements through them. While the free block paradigm of the modern city erects towering buildings distanced from pedestrian movement, the proposal offered a porous structure with branching indoor and outdoor spaces that began to reduce the distance of the built form from the street; it dissolved the discreet separation between the on-site programmed space and the street activities. With the new framework of public space inserted into the site, a variety of close and distant views to the variety of spatial conditions were offered to draw passers-by into the block. Diversely programmed spaces located at intersections of the continuously folding ground were tied together through varying extents of interiority and exteriority to blur the binary opposition between internalized and open spaces. The proposal encouraged opportunities of engagement amongst pedestrians and occupants by presenting a hierarchy of walkable and lingering spaces. It gave the pedestrian the option to choose between alternate routes of movement between different levels, interior and exterior spaces, and programmed and unprogrammed areas. Thus, the pedestrian was allowed to choreograph his or her journey between these transitions. In its questioning of the stratification that persist within contemporary layers of public movement within the city, the

163

thesis took inspiration from the Nolli's Map of Rome. While the Nolli Map conceives and represents public spaces as a continuous entity, permeating into interiors of public buildings, the proposal extended that notion of a contiguous and continuous public realm in both section and plan of the city through the interwoven layers of the thickened ground. The architectural language of the intervention contrasts the orthogonal, pure form of the existing Miesian towers. This was done to reframe and re-introduce the newly conceived public domain within the area, promoting a new image to not only engage users who visit the site on a regular basis but to also attract the external community into the daily life of the Financial District. While this thesis tests the hypothesis on a single existing block, the design strategies that were employed could be adapted and re-used on other existing blocks or in the development of an entirely new block. The use of these design strategies would ensure that the physical and spatial framework of architecture within these designed spaces activates of the public realm and offers better civic legibility. An improvement in the quality and intensity of social interaction within the urban landscape could have the effect of thickening the public realm. This thesis project was a starting point for exploring ways in which the existing condition with urban blocks can be rethought and reimagined to revitalize the public domain. Further consideration and development could further look into other design concerns such as economic viability, existing designed policies, constraints of operating on a heritage site, construction details, etc. This would allow foreseeing the materialization of such a proposal. Although the design exploration has begun to look into concerns such of seasonal variations within the site and the facilitation of control, privacy and maintenance at the intersection of the public and private realm, further refinement of the research could help to build upon it. The primary goal of this thesis was to plant the seeds of a new perception towards the integration of public spaces within the built environment, and allowing a break away from the notion of architecture being an independent, selfenclosed entity. The proposed manipulation of the ground attempted to create a network of inviting, connected public spaces that intersect with existing pedestrian movement network, juxtaposing movements and events to produce a thickened public realm. Its manifestation on a single site is intended to catalyze similar interventions in an ongoing dynamic process. The re-imagination of the Toronto Dominion Block acts as a case study to which the theory and research is applied. It is meant to provoke discussion with regards to the built environment's relationship to the public domain. It encourages the manipulation of the ground plane as an important part of architectural discourse and practice. In "Cities for a Small Planet", Richard Roger (1997, 152) critically suggested that,
164

"The physical and intellectual accessibility of the public domain is a litmus test of society's values: inclusive and thriving public spaces foster tolerance and radical thought." Re-imagining the ways by which public spaces are created by the thickened articulation of the ground of can begin to push the boundaries of what contemporary architecture is and what it could be.

8_Appendix 1_Design Research: 1.1_Interaction of the built form and the pedestrian: To explore how the configuration, arrangement, scale and ground condition can effects the user interface, a series of explorations were done through physical mass models as elaborated below.
Interface of the Public Realm: Arrangement of Built form + Pause Moments

Model 1, 2 and 3 show pause spaces offered along in adjacency to the street offering the most visibility while lacking the privacy of a defined space or the curiosity aspect of it. Model 4 shows a courtyard condition. Although if offers the privacy from the street traffic, if the formal composition doesn't offer enough visibility it would lack civic legibility as a city space and result in limited use. The 5 th explores another courtyard condition offers multiple visual steps as one moves along the street that provides curiosity, creates desire to use the framed space without creating a disconnect with the street life.

167

Models 6 and 7 explore plaza conditions that are elevated or depressed. Here it was realized that the depth or the height to which the plaza is raised is crucial to its use. A depressed plaza, if too deep loses connection to the street's vitality while an elevation plaza if raised to high going beyond the human eye level doesn't work better than a wall sepa rating street activity. Thus it is important to determine appropriate depth or height of the plaza if it is to engage with the street life. Models 8 and 9 explore conditions when the streets wrap around the designed space which has become common place in contemporary practice of engaging the public realm at upper levels of the building. When the ramps are places oriented to the front, they do take up a lot of the street space while wrapping around the built form impacts the spatial condition of the indoor spaces while losing connection to the street after a certain height. Thus attempts to use the elevated street as a tool to vitalize street life much take into consideration the following parameters. Model 10, 11, 12 and 13 explore the possible edge conditions that the built form can offer. While some offer more sheltered walking space for the pedestrian others offered greater visually interactive conditions. Model 13 was an attempt to explore the appropriate scale of height and span of cantilever for meaningful edge condition between street and built form

The explorations above examines a catalogue of typical conditions offered or created by the built fabric of the city and how they respond to the pedestrian experience and the diverse nature of users that interact with the space. The study attempted to infer the formal strategies that would best offer a desirable environment to create a thickened public realm at the interface of the built fabric of the city and the streets. 1.2_Understanding the gradient of the public and private realms: Gradient of Public and Private: In order to be able to design a fluid transition between city-the public and the building program- the inhabitants, it becomes necessary to be able to realize what properties need to be instilled in each of the spaces to create a changing gradient from the public to the private. The description below is summarizations from different readings on the topic of the public-private. Primarily extracts are from the book, Public and Private Spaces of the City by Ali Madanipou and the Edward T. Hall's "The Human Dimension". Private Semi-Private (internal space) Semi-Public (external space) Public

Public Space: Physically and visually open to all with no Restrictions to use. Semi-Public Space (outside spaces): Visible to the public but contains real or symbolic cues in landscape such as fencing or a texture change to make a change of threshold Semi-Private Space (indoor spaces): Spaces can be partially visible to the public but access is selective or limited to residents who live there or are invited. Private Space: Secluded from the public and accessible to those allowed by residents or just the residents themselves depending on the nature of use of the space. The character of each space Public + Private depends on the way the boundary is articulated and the configuration of what lies behind the boundary, how the boundary is constructed, what they are made of, what they are meant to signify and how they relate to the sphere that lie on the other side. Cue to demarcate a change in the nature of such spaces or thresholds: Some of such cues include: Physical barriers (such as fencing, gates, etc.), Change in level (step down or step up), Potential use dedicated to specified spaces, hierarchy or scale of space, nature of threshold / opening, scope of circulation, faÃ§ade articulation, variety of hard and soft landscape, quality of light (natural light-artificial
169

light), concave or convex entry ways the invite or deter people from entering, restricted time of accessibility, physical dimension of the space. In order to further understand how spaces are experienced it becomes important to also reflect on concepts of personal space as that impact one's experience in and of a space. Personal Space/ Socio-psychological personal space: Personal space is the space that a person and others observe around his/her body, as the extension of the body. It is the space that is emotionally charged and helps regulate the spacing of individuals. Interpersonal Relationships based on Personal Space: Intimate PersonalSocialPublic (Distances observed in each category depended on the desired mode of communication.) Territoriality: A set of behaviours and cognitions a person or group exhibits, based on perceived ownership of physical space.

Section 37(3) of the Planning Act-Ontario for Privately Owned Public Spaces: Section 37 of the Planning act for Ontario authorizes a municipality with appropriate Official Plan provisions to pass zoning by-laws involving increases in the height or density otherwise not permitted by the Zoning By-law, in return for the provision by the owner of community benefits. The community benefits must be set out in the zoning by-law. The community benefits may be secured in an agreement which may be registered on title. The term "community benefits" reflects the City's priority on providing public benefits with in the local community in which the contributing development project is located. The increase in height and/or density is an incentive to the developer to provide community benefits at no cost to the City. Section 5.1.1 of the City's Official Plan, provides a planning framework for the use of Section 37.City Council has also adopted detailed "Implementation Guidelines for Section 37 of the Planning Act". Under Toronto's Official Plan, developments that exceed a threshold of 10,000 square meters of gross floor area, and where the application increases the permitted density by at least 1,500 square meters, and/or significantly increases the permitted height, are typically subject to Section 37 provisions. Models for such this Practice: Lever House (1952) and Seagrams Building (1958)

Resulting Circumstance of Public Private Partnerships and Privately Owned Public Spaces: The following discussion summarizes two comparative analysis, one of a Public Private Partnership and one of Privately owned public space, to demonstrate how such an agreement can both prove to be beneficial for the sustenance of the public domain as well as how they can limit the vitality of public spaces. Public Private Partnership: Case Study_01: Bryant Park, Manhattan: Located in the New York City borough of Manhattan, Bryant Park is cited as a model for success of publicprivate partnership. In 1686, the area of the current Bryant Park was designated as a public space but unfortunately by 1970 it had become a no-go-zone for the ordinary citizens and visitors as it was taken over by the undesirable (drug dealers, prostitutes, and the homeless) with the lack of maintenance. In the 1980's, A coordinated program of amenities, including book and flower markets, cafes, landscape improvements, and entertainment activities, was initiated by a parks advocacy group called the Parks Council and immediately brought new life to the park. Effort continued over the succeeding years by The Bryant Park Restoration Corporation (BPRC), a private sector, when the New York City delegated the management of the park over to them to improve conditions in the park. With their funding restoration began with the goal of opening up the park to the streets and encouraging activity within it. Under the BPRC's management, several areas of the park are often leased out for private events for short time to generate income to fund development and maintenance cost for the park which somewhat limits those areas temporarily but still ensure regular upgrading of the park and making it useable by the greater public.

Case Study_02: Plazas, Santa Fe, Mexico: The Santa Fe Plaza is a National Historic Landmark in downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico. The plaza, or "city-square", was originally, and is still to this day, the center gathering place in town. Nearby businesses took charge of the management of the historic plaza. So juveniles and homeless people are now unwelcome; vendors must be licensed and are also excluded from the plaza during major events (e.g., Fiesta and Fiesta Market); and certain activities (skateboarding and hacky-sack playing) are restricted to the southeast corner of the plaza. As a result, the local residents do not feel as comfortable going to the plaza not only because their sense of belonging has been eroded but the area abutting the plaza was gentrified and the local shops have been replaced with national chain stores. Thus deteriorating the quality of the space.

Privately owned public spaces: Case Study_01: Bank of America, New York: Inspite of a formal expression that allows visibility inside and is rather inviting, the space inside the building lacks vibrancy because of both its design measures as well as its maintenance. The choice of materiality for the interior creates a sterile ambience give a sense of formality. Also signs listing rules that are placed by the entrances and inside the space to forbid littering, running and skateboarding and such activities further deter participation. Security personnel often stay near the bank counter and monitor the interior public space. Case Study_02: ING Direct, Yonge Street, Toronto: In spite of looking seemingly closed off from the outside, the space inside is vibrant through public use. This becomes possible because of the nature of its programing and suggestive usage pattern of the designed space. The ground floor is designed to resemble a living room with living room furniture and bar stools with provision of several tablet computers for free internet connection. A kitchen with a coffee machine and mugs are also meant to welcome people to use this space. People can use this space for various purposes, such as reading, meeting friends, or simply drinking a cup of coffee. No rules are placed inside to regulate any uses but certain activities may not be acceptable inside it, such as protests or spontaneous art performances. Instead of security personnel, several young ING staff members are available inside to serve people who may have banking questions.

Thus it can be inferred that it is not necessarily the external tectonics and formal expression in architecture that can enhance the vitality of the public domain in the space rather is a close balanced relationship of both the program and the formal expression together that makes even a privately owned public space accessible to the public. Involvement of the Private Sector in Design and Management shifts the objectives of public spaces from apparent. "Social and Communal" to primary "Commercial and Profit Making" (Doherty et al., 2008). Some causes of exclusion can be identified are the increased number of regulations and controls are added, making public facilities less accessible (or open) to the Public. Social Stratification in the Public Spaces is one other cause that limits use. People's Right to Free Speech and establishment of rules to prohibit certain activities further catalyze vitality of these spaces.

175

2.0_Reinterpreting strategies from existing block morphologies: Since the thesis proposal operates within the extents of an urban block, a number of establish block typologies were analysed to extract design principles that were then implemented into the design proposal. Current practice more often than not demonstrates a circumstance where the public realm ends at the curb; this urges the incorporation of mid-block connections and vaguely defined plaza spaces that extend the pedestrian experience and thus enrich the public realm. Whether it consists of a re-imagining of layouts or the presenting of a diversity of programming, the examination of the morphology of city blocks plays a key role in understanding and articulating an extended public realm. In order to better address the lack of vitality within setback plazas and unstructured residual spaces, and to more successfully integrate them into the public realm, an overview must be made of the primary block morphologies and their relative responses. The three block morphologies explored includes the Haussmannien or Closed block (` ilot ferme'), the Open block ('ilot ouvert) and the Free plan ((Pas d'ilot) block.

Pedestrian activity only at the edge and does not permeate into the block Singular spatial experience

Pedestrian activities extended into the block Areas of interface with built form increases Varying Spatial Conditions Source: Author's Own, 2015

Buildings set back from sidewalk and public movement Too open to create a desirable microclimate

Haussmannien Block (the closed block-`ilot ferme) concept is characterized by the closed perimeter of the block. In this layout, buildings encompass the edges of the block so that there is no access for pedestrian who want to enter the block of small courtyard spaces within. The pedestrian interface is limited to the edge of the block; these edges are often marked by semi-private shops or flanked by storefronts. Although the proposed model offers distinctly defined streets, it limits natural light into the block and prevents pedestrian activities from bleeding block interiors by means of a thoroughfare. The resulting morphological homogeneity offers a spatial monotony with a fixed public faÃ§ade. As a response to the issue faced by the closed block, Christian De Portzamparc proposed the Open block or `ilot ouvert that was
176

characterized by an open street condition created by semi-free buildings. The proposal recommended that approximately 40% of the perimeters of each block be opened to allow not only for light and air to enter but to allow an engaging thoroughfare complemented by gardens and landscaping to flow through the site. This interior corridor would extend street experience by allowing multiple vistas into the block and would also give it potential of mixed programming, enhancing the relationship of the block to the public realm. Opening up of the block would also increase pedestrian interface with each building facade. Christian de Portzamparc's "urban groove" (as he termed it) creates a new type of relationship between spaces open to the public and private spaces; he points out that they can enrich each other by their juxtaposition and in turn enliven their adjacent streets. This thesis primarily examines Free Plan block conditions. Plan Libre or the Free Plan Block is characterized by loosely arranged independent buildings that sit on ground that is demarcated by peripheral streets. This free-plan morphology is a significant reflection of Modernist thinking. It leads to individuality of structures as it allows them to rise as separate entities with little if any reference to one another. Given its individual existence within the block, the built forms are set back from each other; this creates a relative open-ground condition that generates a sense of no-man's land in the vaguely defined buffer space between towers. As the free-block paradigm erects towering buildings distanced from pedestrian movement, their interaction is significantly reduced. The setbacks create spaces to showcase the iconic built form instead of spaces intended to engage and use.

3_Design Explorations: 3.1_Testing the themes in three dimensions: To further explore the themes discussed in regards to the way in which the public realm engages with the private domain (infiltration, transgression, coexistence, occupation, parasitism), it was tried out on a 3d model of modular pixelated blocks to experiments if they hold potential to be realized. Spaces that were inside the form-"occupation" were connected spatially to the rest of the different themes to ensure a continuous path the moved from the outside to the inside and the outside again. On certain occasions they inhabit on the surface of the built form.

Merits: -Starts to look at scaling down the open public spaces to a more appropriate human scale. -Attempts to offer a variety of enclosures from open space to shaded gazebos to semi enclosed and closed spaces. -Attempts to create a visual connection to the underground. -Attempts to take allow public access to various levels of the built environment instead of just restricting to the ground plane. -Envisions inserting some public functions -Multiplication of public platforms that look into each other.

Challenges: -The ground plane remains relatively untouched as intervention spaces are created more over and into the existing buildings. -Connection to the underground left as a wider window to the subterranean not so much of a transitioning continuous space.

183

- Intersections look like aerial acts which brings about the question as to why the public would go so high up to use it -There is little likeliness that the public network created would be less monotonous then the PATH network. -Separate isolate theme based interventions, lacks consistency and could benefit for overlay of conceptual themes (parasitic, infiltration etc) on a single circumstance. Cohesion needed. -A more consistent intervention would be better than the disparate smaller ones which further fragment the site instead of unifying it. -Too many formal additions, required minimum structure with maximum impact -Gradient between public and private is lacking. Spaces not articulated enough, both spatially and programmatically. Connections to lobby areas not clear -Fails to create a microclimate for the colder seasons of the year.

4.3_Explorations of Roof Panels: The intent was to offer a roof of varying porosity that allows varying degrees of light to enter, much like light through foliage in the forest. An exploration was made through physical models to test the varying possibilities of roof panel detail that could be utilized to create varying lighting conditions within the designed spaces. A combination of these panels was also tested to see how it would operate on the greater extent of the roof.
