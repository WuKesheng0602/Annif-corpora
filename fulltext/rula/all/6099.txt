'ABSTRACT

This paper makes a critical assessment of the study conducted by the CIMM (Standing Committee on Immigration and Citizenship) on undocumented and te~porary foreign workers. It examines records of three moments of the process: (i) minutes of meetings during the assessment phase; (ii) the CIMM Report; (iii) and the Government Response. The argument sustained throughout the paper is that government's negative representation of non-status workers is conveniently constructed to avoid policy changes and consequently sustains the irregular movement of migrants.

Key words: non-status workers, irregular migration, Foucault, non-status representation

1. Introduction

Non-status migration is a global issue and a source of continuous political concern with "no end in sight" (Papademetriou, 2005, p.l). In Canada, the non-status population is estimated to be half-a-million and its increase tendency is aligned to growing of Temporary Foreign Workers Program (TFWP) (Hennebry, 2010). However, despite its importance and apart from a few exceptional episodes l , irregular migration is still not part of the national public debate, something that led Goldring et al. (2009) to conclude that "in Canada, migrant illegality is largely a non-issue" (p. 240). In releases from Citizenship and Immigration Canada, irregular migration is approached from a criminal or risk perspective with reference made concurrently to human trafficking, terrorism and border control. Considering both the dearth of debate and choice of themes in the public debate, the study conducted by the Standing Committee on Immigration and Citizenship (CIMM) on undocumented and temporary foreign workers represents a unique 0pp0mmity to understand the official representation of undocumented migration in Canada. It also allows for an "insider perspective" of the discussion on the issue by politicians and
.

.

government representants. The relevance of this approach is justified by the influence exercised by official public discourse on population's opinion, as P9inted ~ut in Menjivar
& Kil (2002):

( ... ) official cues are a key influence in public opinion on social issues. Public officials' discourse on immigrant related issues can thus powerfully affect the lives of immigrants (p. 160)..

This paper makes a critical assessment of the study conducted by the CIMM on undocumented and temporary foreign workers using elements of Foucault's social theory to support the analysis. Public records of three moments -of the CIMM study are examined: (i) minutes of meetings of the study's assessment phase; (ii) CIMM report (Report, 2009); and (iii) the government reply (Government of Canada Response, 2009). The argument sustained in the paper is that government's negative representation of nonstatus workers is conveniently constructed to avoid policy changes and consequently sustains the irregular movement of migrants.
1.1 Definitions & Limitations

Terms currently referred in the literature to designate "people lacking legal migratory status - non-status, undocumented, unauthorized, irregular, and out-of-status as well as their variants applied to migration (e.g. non-status migration) are employed interchangeably in this paper. They refer to the definition of undocumented workers offered in Magalhaes et al. (2009):
r. "

. .-

Women and men who participate in the Canadian labour force by legally entering the country and (a) not respecting the limits of their visa or (b) over staying their visa permitted time, as well as by illegally entering the country, including those smuggled across the border (n.p.). , It is acknowledged that non-status workers fo~ a heterogeneous group in terms of experience and _ education. In this paper, however, the representation of non-status individuals :~ll follow the tendency highlighted in the literature where non-status

{

workers are mostly considered low,:,skilled workers2· This limitation is necessary to sustain the argumentation that irregular migration is triggered by the lack of legal channels linking temporary work with permanence in Canada. Also, despite the several ways leading to out-of-status conditions in the literature, this paper will emphasize the route provided by Temporary Foreign Work Programs, specifically programs for low-skilled workers, this association having been established by ,., . .

the CIMM study 1.2 Research Problem Description In 2008 the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration (CIMM) was

commissioned by the House of Commons to investigate the situation of temporary foreign workers and non-status workers in Canada due to the allegation that labor needs across the country were been addressed by these workers. For almost three weeks in 2008 the Committee traveled to 12 cities across Canada gathering material and testimonies to assist it to understand issues involving temporary and nonstatus workers. More than 50 testimonies were heard and hundreds of briefs from diverse organizations were received (Report, 2009). Results from this process led the Committee to conclude. that, in fact, temporary foreign worker programs were used for purposes different from what they were originally designed for, due to a combination of labor shortages in certain areas of the country, and immigration constraints. Instead of fulfilling seasonal or temporary labour shortages, temporary programs were used to attend to long-term labor needs and bring to Canada workers otherwise not available under the economic stream of

immigration, due to large time delays in application processing or lack of worker qualifications in this stream. The quality and quantity of evidences made available to CIMM led it to conclusive observations about the situation of non-status workers. Particularly significant were: the general understanding of demand for unskilled work in the long-term; the insufficiency of the immigration programs to provide for this demand; and the deficiency of authorized venues for temporary workers to remain permanently in Canada.
\

The~e

observations, however, were not enough to unify the CIMM members towards supporting' an amnesty program for people currently under an irregular status situation in Canada. Justifying the impossibility to "solve the problem" (p. 49) of non-status migration due to the "complex and multifaceted" (p. 49) character of the issue, the Committee limited its recommendations of measures aiming to intercept the growing of non-status migration in Canada to: (i) the creation of pathways for permanence of temporary workers; (ii) review of the points system; and (iii) enforcing the role of Provincial Nominee Programs. A CIMM report summarizing these findings and providing recommendations to improve TFWPs was delivered to the House of Commons with a requested for a government response to the recommendations. It went to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) which formulate~ a reply in its Government of Canada Response document (2009). Regardless of strong evidence by the Committee favorable to non-status
migr~ts, the government refused to regularize "those who failed to respect the tenns and

conditions of the program and remained in Canada through illegal avenues" (p. 11), in 'a

fashion that associates non-status condition with poor character and criminal attitudes. The government also refused to create pathways linking the tempOrary program with

4

permanent residence besides the one existing through the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), justifying it by a claim that low-skilled workers would have problems adjusting to the Canadian labor market due their lack of education, training and language skills (Government of Canada Response, 2009).

2. Literature Review 2.1 Non-Status Migration: A Growing Glo~al Phenomenon On a global scale, it is estimated that the nonMstatus populat~on comprises 15 to 20 percent of the world's total immigrant stock; involving 30 to 40 million people (Papademetriou, 2005). The largest concentrations of irregulars are in the USA, South Africa, and Continental Europe. The population in Canada is believed to be half-a-million (Papademetriou, 2005). Considering all variants of the phenomenon, irregular migration is a global reality, including retirees living without autho~zation in developing countries, and categories of people who temporarily or permanently fallout of status due to backlogs, government rules and bur7aucracies (Papademetriou, 2005). In the USA, Ettinger (2009) was able to trace the origins of the irregular movement back to the mid-1880s. This happened when new routes into the US through Canadian and Mexican borders were pioneered by immigrants wishing to circumvent immigration barriers placed on American ports.·· The restrictions, in this case, were
direc~ed towards "paupers, convicts, the mentally infirm, Chinese workers, and workers

under contract" (p. 11). Ettinger (2009) draws a direct association between increases of

form. The United Nations', Human Development report (UNHD, 2009) attributes the increase of irregular migration to two factors: (i) the entry policies of receiving countries restricting access of low-skilled workers and (ii) heightened border controls. The report (UNHD, 2009) emphasizes the current demand for low-skilled workers and entry policies that overly restrict their entry by saying that such policies create "denial and delay" (p. 95) in labor needs, worsening the situation of non-status workers. 2.2 Problems Posed by Non-Status Migration Papademetriou (2005) contends that governments need to deal with irregular immigration because it "~ubverts a' society's legal order and undermines or perverts a

the potential to cause damages to all involved, including receiving and sending societies 7

and migrants themselves. The roster of problems for receiving countries involves safety concerns, undesirable effects on the labor market and labor regulations, complications on foreign policy, and a generalized sense of lack of control (papademetriou, 2005). Sending countries' concerns are with basic rights for their nationals, complications in their
t,

relationships with receiving countries, and interference in power resulting from the strengthening of human trafficking syndicates' (Papademetriou, 2005). For migrants, the consequences of irregular migration can be devastating. Those victimized by human smuggling and trafficking "mortgage their very lives and futures to their 'smugglers" (Papademetriou, 2005, p. 4). Access to rights and assistance enabled by citizenship or other forms of legal membership is not available to

migration by being provided with workers requiring less payment, willing to work longer hours, under questionable conditions and unlikely to complaint about it. Bauder (2006) refers that "the creation of a labor force of undocumented immigrants" (p. 24) configures in an important strategy for traditional and nontraditional immigrants societies to supply a competitive labor force specially their construction and service sectors. Adding to that,

Walsh (2008) sustains that reforms implemented in the immigration systems in Canada

~

and Australia aimed to "secure exploitable labor for the lower tiers of the service , economy" (p. 810) in order to prepare these countries for globalization. In the same line, Papademetriou
~2005)

commenting about the importance of irregular migration to the

prosperity of receiving societies, contends that economic interests involved with the movement can be so significant to the point of interfering with government's will to fight the issue. 2.3 Perspectives on Irregular Migration The United Nations Human Development report (UNHD, 2009) maintains that forces driving global human movements such as economic disparities and unequal population growth between the North and the South are expected to continue for the next decades. This trend is associated with the expected growth of irregular migration. In order to counter this tendency, the UNHD report emphatically recommends that immigrant receiving countries reevaluate their entry policies to make them more

and also the ones willing to take unauthorized paths of entry and stay in those countries.

"

Therefore, the number one ~ecommendation made in the report is for "liberalizing and
simpli~ng

regular channels that allow people to seek work abroad" (p. 95), which may

9

be pursued through the creation or expansion of temporary programs in sectors of "truly seasonal" (p. 96) demand, as well as by an increase in the number of visas provided to low-skilled workers in an initial temporary basis but SUbjected to extension or leading to a situation of permanence "at the discretion of the host government" (p. 98). " Similar opinion is expressed by Papademetriou (2005), president of the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). Predicting that irregular migration will remain a "top issue in the political agenda in the near future, he argues against'the exclusive u~e of such "law~andforce" measures as border controls, labor market regulation, police monitoring. and obstructing asylum demand to combat irregular migration. Although recognizing the necessity of such measures, Papademetriou (2005) contends that priority should be given . ,

to the expansion of legal avenues to facilitate the access of migrants, on a temporary and

permanent basis, as stated below:

"

To deal with this reality, a school of thought is emerging that argues that channeling much illegal immigration into regulated pathways might be a more realistic course than articulating policy goals that seek total control or exclusion-goals that tend to create unrealistic public expectations and fuel further climates of intolerance (p. 4).

2.4 Non-Status Migration in Canada
Typically, non-status workers in Canada live in large urb~ centres - with Toronto alone believed to hold almost half of the population - and work injob~ despised by the domestic labour force due their safety

~r tu:ning conditions (part-time,' seasonal,

casual) in the construction, manufacturing, and service industries (Magalhaes et aI., 2009).

10

A range of skills and education are represented within the non-status group. For example, Magalhaes et al. (2009) refer them as "educated and uneducated workers" that "fail to get past Canada's points based system which favors immigrants with particular occupational experiences, official languages fluency, and university education" (n.p.). The profile of 155 undocumented women living in Toronto registered by Pashang (2010) also reinforces the idea of diversity among non-status migrants: most of participants came from South Asia, Africa, Eastern or Central Europe, have at least_ a high school degre~, and high knowledge of English learned before arriving.

2.4.1 Pathways Leading to Non-Status. Differently from United States, most of undocumented migrants in Canada enter

:

the country by authorized means and fall out of status later by overstaying their visa· conditions or when their claims for asylum are denied (Goldring et aI, 2009). Goldring et al. (2009) describe several ways leading to irregular migration, including breaking up of a sponsorship relatio~hip, having been denied ~ylum or refugee claims, overstaying work or student pef:lllits, and "entering the country by unauthorized means. After examining several routes leading to non-status in Canada, Goldring et al. (2009) conclude that a . generator role is exercised by immigration policy on irregular migration. This role would be exercised by (i) reducing.., opportunities for permanent residence, (ii) increasing

for people out of status (Goldring et al., 2009).

11

Focusing on the situation of temporary farmworkers 3, McLaughlin & Hennebry (2010) argue that state policies and regulations that define conditions of employment of these workers are deemed primary responsible for "construction of precarious status and the vulnerabilities such forms of status engender" (p. 2). By emphasizing this, to McLaughlin & Hennebry (2010) seek to exempt the workers themselves for choosing , ( , become non-status: With very limited options and from highly constrained positions of power, migrants use whatever strategies are available to them to secure their interests, but often with difficult consequences for themselves and their families, particularly with respect to their mental and physical health (p.2). The lack of legal and adequate channels for farmworkers transitioning from temporary to permanent condition is seen by McLaughlin & Hennebry (2010) as the core

problem leading to irregular migration. They explain that typically farmworkers are not considered for permanence, as the ones employed through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SWAP) are not entitled to apply; and the ones hired through the "Low-Skilled Pilot Project,,4 (LSPP) may apply if nominated by employers in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Both are criticized for "heighten[ing] worker precarity, as the workers vie for employer support and may be .willing to accept unsafe ,

work or mistreatment to get it" (p' 3). The described conditions led McLaughlin & Hennebry. (2010) to the following conclusion: _

MFWs [Migrant Farmworkers] are .treated as temporary guestworkers who are not meant to stay beyond their contracts, nor to immigrate to Canada (McLaughlin & Hennebry, 2010, p. 3). 2.4.2 Living as Non-Status Emotional tolls of living without status are referred in Magalhaes et al. (2009) and include permanent anxiety resulting from fear of detention/deportation, fear of becoming sick, and fear of become unemployed. Not being able to plan for the future and lacking social network are other features referred by them.

3. Analytical Framework: A Foucauldian Approach to Non-Status Migration' In this section, theoretical elements from Foucault's (2003a) social theory are applied to notions of non-status migration described in the previous part. Specifically, Foucault's conception of power, objectification and discourse are used to discuss features of the movement. Although these elements appear connected in Foucault's theory they are treated separately here to facilitate both their application and understanding. 3.1 Power Foucault (2003b) makes a dynamic representation of power. He invites us to think power in terms of multiple forces in action, "[as] relations of force that intersect, interrelate, converge, or, on the contrary, oppose to one another or tend to cancel each other out (p. 294). Foucault defines power as "a way in which some act on others"

<p.

137). In his conception power needs to be authored by someone- it is not an abstract entity that happens by itself - what helps to think phenomenon like non-status migration in concrete terms and not as

an

abstract -production. Another idea is that exercise of

power implies the establishment of a relationship formed by a succession of actionsreactions strategically planned. Non-status migration is associated with restrictive entry-policies of immigration in place on immigrant-receiving societies (UNHD, 2009). Processes of exclusionI ' . '

inclusion enacted by these policies are legitimated by the sovereignty principle that grant nation-states the right of choosing their members and, consequently, avoiding undesirable ones. The internal treatment dispensed by the Canadian government to non-status ~oup advances the process of exclusion initiated by its entry-policy. This group is not entitled

14

to essential social services and labor rights~ besides being criminalized in discourse and in practice. The limitations imposed to non-status individuals in Canada impact their control over life and challenge their physical and mental health, 8$ well as theirs family members (Landolt & Goldring, 2010; Magalhaes et aI., 2009). In daily-life, power constrains impinged in the first place by the state are reproduced in other relations established between non-status workers and their employers, and with workmates or acquaintances that enjoy other citizenship status. Forces of resistance in non-status migration are represented by action of grassroots organizations on immigrants' rights. A further important notion found in Foucault's (2003a) work is the central role . that he attributes to the state as regulator of power. In contemporary societies "power relations have been progressively,' governmentalized, that· is to say, elaborated, rationalized, and centralized in the form of, or under the auspices of, state institutions" (p. ,142) with the ultimate goal of facilitating population govc;rnance. This biD-power, has a methodical nature. It seeks "to administer~ optimi~e, and multiply it [life] by SUbjecting it to precise controls
~d

comprehensive regulations" (p. 259). Bio-power manifests itself

through classificatory, or4edy and control procedures that are impinged in the management of matters related to the population such as public health, housing, migration, life expectancy, and bi!th and mortality rates . . Another sphere of action of bio-power conceived by Foucault is to discipline citizens. This ~k is forged by sO,cial institutions and has the u.Itimate goal of produc.ipg subordinated citizens aligned with social and economic objectives of the state. The . historic consequence of. this systematic and ,methodic, form of governance .was t~e
,

15

generation of a "normalizing society" (p. 266) in which economic processes and relations of domination were reproduced (Foucault, 1984). The "order" forged by bio·power is totally disrupted with non-status rrngration. The idea of individuals that inscribe themselves in

an autonomous manner and without

having legal authorization for it totally opposes to the spirit of bio-power. In this contex~,
,

non-status individuals are promptly identified as "deviant" and permanently seen as "'remaindering' other of the system, an extra but not a surplus" (Lee, 2010, p. 332). The merit of non-status migration; according to Lee (2010), is to expose the inflexibility of current legalistic category of citizenship, opening up "the query for other forms of citizenship. Lee: (2010) also perceives" the categorization made in citizenship a manifestation of bio-power in its work: of "facilitating modem liberal governance in ensuring the normalized mundane reproduction of social life' in' a 'proper' form and 'proper' way': (p. 331). Bio-power executes it by providing

a script of ideal citizen

embedded in social institutions and attempting to "reproduce domesticated subjects who
"

-

will be settled and kept in place, thus reducing the possibility and potency of critical dissents and deviant transgression" (p. 332). However, irregular migration is a paradoxical issue: at the same time that it is publically condemned" the movement is encouraged in industrial societies, as, was
1

.

.

previously seen. Therefore; . with irregular work already incorporated into developed
'"

econ<?mies, bio-power now is employed to sustain the vulnerability of the undocumented popUlation by denying them civic and employment rights and by avoiding the creation'of legal alternatives for the movement. Bauder (2006) well captured the idea by pointing'out . that ,"migrant and immigran£ workers are valuable because they are vulnerable" (p. 22) ..

16

3.2 Processes of Objectification Ransome (2010) has the opinion that individuals as social actors enjoy little "biography or autonomy" (p. 257) in Foucault's theory. Such lack of agency goes even further in the processes of objectification conceived by Foucault. He states that through practices of categorization (e.g., good and bad immigrant; legal and illegal; immigrants and non-immigrants) minority groups have their representation politically constructed in a way to justify their' subjugation and social exclusion. The process is called
~'objectifying"

because it does not acknowledge individuals and their humanity; it rather

imposes a "new identity" that "categorizes the individual, marks him by his own individuality, attaches him to his own identity, imposes a law of truth on him that he must recognize and others have to recognize in him" (Foucault, 2003a, p. 130).
Fouca~lt's

idea of objectification is identified in the conception of, "cultural

representations" described in Bauder (2006): "judgments that associate people with. distinct characteristics and qualities and assign them to particular social and economic
roles"~ (p~ 29), Applied to immigrants, constructed representations have the capacity to

. shape and legitimate labor practices toward these workers as well as to influence attitude towards them. Bauder (2006) comments that "feelings of abjections" (p. 30) directed to refugees, asylum seekers, and illegal immigrants in many industrialized countries, have the effect to devaluate these .foreign workers and subordinate them to non-migrant workers "although both groups may posses the same ability and skill to perform a given job or complete a given task" (p. 30). A similar situation is observed in Canada where the representations of non-status ~grants is mostly made in negative terms, assochiting these people with criminality, dubious character, and a threat to others (Nyers,'201O) and rarely

17

portraying them as "fully formed subjects who are capable of autonomy, selfrepresentation, and claim making" (Nyers, 2010, p. 132). Such representations endorse measures of persecution applied against the group at the same time that justify inaction of the government. 3.3 Discourse
.
. .

Discourses can be defined as "the prevailing mode and manner of accounts and conversations that go on in society and that make one historical period distinguishable from another" (Ransome, 2010, p. 249). During the development of his work, Foucault transited from a conception of discourse representative of the· world, a verbal/textual representation of the exterior social reality and the. power-play implied on it, to a more influential form where discourse (Le., "discursive practice") is conceived as part of reality, a reality that is shaped by the discourse in formation and by a particular way of seeing the world (Ransome, 2010). Therefore, discourses have the ability of shaping perceptions and defining attitudes. Due to' its active role in the production of the social reality, discourses are also considered a mechanism of production of power. Ransome (2010) explains how power operates on discourses: Discourses and the intellectual paradigms or epistemes of particular periods that they make up, represent one such manifestation of power. They exercise power not just on the intellectual plain of thoughts, ideas and meanings ( ... ), but also in a much more concrete and physical sense because these ideas become inscribed into the material practices and institutions of the society (p. 256). . The association of discourse and power in Foucault's theory assumes that discourses in society are mostly produced by those in privileged positions within society.

18

It is also assumed that _discourses manifest and are interested in keep the social order
established by the majority. Therefore, through discourses, "status quo" is maintained and reproduced through a mechanism explained in Ransome (2010): The orthodox majority of the population seeks control over the deviant minority not just because it controls the discourse through which these individuals and groups become defined as deviant, but because the same attitude of mind becomes embedded in the political, cultural and legal institutions of society (p. 256). The polarized positioning that nonstatus migration raises can be explained by the political circumstances involved in the issue. Non-status migration challenges the selfgranted right of nation-states to choose their occupants. The movement is reacted by incriminatory representation of its members made by nation-states that, in this way, set the stage for. power measures applied against this group, following the contended by Walsh (2008): "States may not be able to prevent unauthorized entries, but they still exert the capacity to construct and enforce categories of 'illegality', which have very real social consequences" (p. 790).

4. Research Methods

My first contact with the topic developed in this paper happened two years ago during transcription of interviews of people without status living in Canada, for a research project. At that time I remember being disturbed by the contrasting realities of those interviewed and the common public perception of them as "civic offenders". These people seemed to be living their lives and making their' choices aiming the best for themselves and for their families, the same kind of aspirations held by most people. However, their conditions were marked by constrains and sometimes irremovable obstacles such as the lack of legal alternatives to permanently stay in Canada. What struck me the most while listening to their stories was their image/treatment as offenders when, in fact, I saw them as victims of a system that had excluded them by deeming them unfit as immigrants.
r.

Since that first contact with the topic I have been interested iti and searched the

literature, and I came across the CIMM Report with- the description of the CIMM study on undocumented and temporary workers, and its findings and recommendations. It represented a rare opportunity to observe in the official realm an open discussion on irregular migration. The CIMM Report led to other related materials: minutes of meetings from the data gathering phase of the CIMM study~ and the reply to the CIMM Report offered. by the- government (Government of Canada Response, 2009). These three elements compose the totality of documents researched in this paper. They are public documents available online and 'will be presented in more details over the next section of this paper. They were chosen due to their potential as parts of the same process (the

20

CIMM study on temporary and undocumented workers) to reveal the dynamic behind the official representation of non-status workers, a perspective explored in this paper. The <qualitative text analysis in the above mentioned documents follow recommendations found in Silvenmm (2000): ( ... ) The distinctive contribution qualitative researchers can make is in utilizing their theoretical resources in the deep analysis of small bodies of publicly shareable data. This means that, unlike many quantitative researchers, we are not satisfied with a simple coding data. Instead, we have to work to show how the (theoretically defmed) elements we have identified are assembled or mutually laminated (p. 828). Silverman (2000) also alerts to the importance of having a well defined analytical approach as well as to work on a limited amount of data· on qualitative analysis. Therefore, the next steps of the study will refer to the establishment of the analytical framework and the definition of data selection criteria. Regarding the first aspect, the choice fell upon Foucault and elements of his social theory. His dynamic conception of power and the special role attributed to the state as power regulator was a good fit to non':' < status reality. Moreover, his notion of objectification/social representation of minority groups well applies to undocumented group. The role attributed to discourse as a powerful way of building perceptions and define attitudes in Foucault's theory was central to explain both the weight of a negative representation on the lives of non-status migrants as well as the objectives aimed by the government sustaininglbuilding such representation. < , As per the second aspect - the defmition of criteria \ for data selection - I established a thematic analysis privileging ,the discourse by politicians and government representatives on undocumented workers and on low-skilled temporary workers. The

21

selection of texts/quotes represented in this paper follows this thematic coding. Exemplifying this, only material from minutes of the CIMM first meeting were selected to be part of this paper due its representation of the official discourse on non-status workers. In this meeting, high-ranked government representatives discussed relevant policy and responded to questions from CIMM members who also had the opportunity to position themselves on the issue. This meeting was considered the best example from all 18 meetings hold by CIMM following the criteria established for thematic coding. The same process applied to the selection of texts· within the CIMM Report and the Governinent Response documents.

5. Analysis 5.1 Preliminaries of the CIMM Study Standing Committees are permanent groups formed by representatives of the Parliament and established by Standing Orders of the House of Commons. They follow specific mandates designated by the House which involve the assessment of expenditures ,
. '

and activities, budgetary planning, and policy development of a specific government department or agency. Committees may also study issues of their own interest. Currently, there are 28 Standing Committees in the House of Commons (Parliament of Canada, 2011): The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration (CIMM) apart from other designations determined by the
House~

has the special mandate to examine and

report matters related to the mandate, management arid operations of the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) (Parliament of Canada, 2011)."

The study on undocumented and temporary foreign workers was adopted by CIMM on November 2007 and initialized on February 2008. It was developed during the 39th Parliament. A final document reporting findings ~d recommendations of the study was delivered to the House of Commons on May 2009 during the 40th Parliament. Change of Parliament led to changes in the CIMM composition too. CIMM memberss during the execution phase of the study were not the same signing the final report. Half of

23

the twelve members were replaced from the initial formation6 strengthening the conservative representation (Le., from 5 to six members) at expense of liberals (i.e., from 4 to 3 members). This alteration may have been a factor in the CIMM lack of consensus to support a program of regularization to non-status workers. \

The CIMM study created an immense volume of information on temporary foreign workers and programs and on non-status migrants/workers through the testimony of experts, government authorities, activists, and representatives of workers, employers,
inigr~ts' associations, industry directorS, and migrants themselves. Approximately 52

panelists presented for Committee members and were questioned by them duri~g the 18 meetings held by the CIMM with the purpose to understand the issues investigated in the ' study. Also, hundreds of written briefs from diverse organizations and industries were sent to the CIMM during the development phase, signaling the importance of the issues addressed by the stUdy.' ;

A diverse approach to irregular migration was observed in the participation of Liberal and New Democratic representatives. Overall sympathetic to issues faced by migrant workers and well informed about immigration policy and programs, they hold a view of irregular migration as resulting from past policy changes and current gaps in the immigration. system. Comments from liberal MP Andrew Telegdi well illustrate this vision. Heavily critical of the point system, ,Telegdi attributed the changes implemented in the points system to the current problems with shortage of labor and irregular migration:

The low-skilled folks are the ones who were eliminated as possible . immigrants to Canada at the time the point system changed (CIMM-13, p. 4). And also, The problem is thafthe system is not very functional, and that's , why there's such a huge shortage. ( ... ) And it comes back to the point system. Skilled trades have a hard time coming in. Labourers ' have a hard time coming in (CIMM-13, p. 4).

Another heavy critic of the current immigration system was the'NDP representative Olivia Chow.

' (CIM-B, p. 17) And also referring to low-skilled workers, she argued:

5.3 CIMM Report

The Report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration (thereafter CIMM Report) (2009) is a 79-page document generated from evidences and discussions provided during the ass,essment phase of the CIMM study. It
~escribes

main

find~ngs

about the situation of temporary and undocumented workers and offers 36 recommendations aiming the improvement of programs. The document is organized in . two parts. The situation of foreign workers and TFWP is analyzed in the first part which covers almost the totality of the document.' The second
,

part~

with only six pages,

"

addresses the situation of undocumented workers: In it, difficulties faced by this group of migrants in terms of vulnerability is presented: Fear of being rePorted to the authorities leads some' non-statu~ workers to tolerate substandard working conditions (p. 48).
It also recognizes the contribution of non-status workers to the economy:

We recognize 'that 'these people are 'contributing to our society by filling a labor need that is not being met domestically (p. 49).
" · ,

'~,

,r

·

Most importantly, the document understands irregular migration as resulting from scarce opportunities available for certain group of migrantS:

We understand that in many cases, these people were failed by our immigration system that provided them with no' realistic opportunity to,immigrate to Canada legally (P',49). We need to ensure that we have an efficient economic immigration system that is responsive to Canada's actual labour needs. The workers we need here in a long-term basis must be able to immigrate here legally on a permanent basis from the start (p. 52).

29

Despite this understanding, the view ,of some CIMM members was that a program of regularization would, be unfair with "hundreds of thousands of people are patiently waiting years to legally call Canada home" (CIMM Report, 2009, p. 48) and could have the undesirable effect of bringing more irregular migrants to the country. This line of thinking prevented the CIMM from supporting a regularization program in its report. Unable to reach a consensus regarding the situation of current irregular migrants, CIMM members opted for finding "practical means" to attenuate the problem. They suggested the following measures in The Report (2009): (i) review of the point system to make it
,

.

more inclusive of different skill levels; (ii) increase the. 'efficiency of the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) as a pathway for permanence of temporary workers; and (iii) create a channel for TFWs transition to permanent residency as happened in the Live-in Caregivec Program (LCP). ,The two last propositions were formalized : in

Recommendation #3 and #6 respectively in the CIMM Repo~ and are presented bellow: ' Recommendation #3: "The committee recommends that the ,Government of Canada initiate dialogue and facilitate cooperation with the provinces and territories, so that the temporary foreign worker' and provincial' nominee programs function together" smoothly to provide a pathway to permanent residency (CIMM Report, 2009, p. 56). -, '

5.4 Government Response

In a 12-page document titled Government of Canada Response to the Report of

the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration: Temporary Foreign Workers and Non-Status Workers (thereafter referred as Government Response), the government
replies to the recommendations made by the CIMM. Initially the document identifies the scope of Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) as to provide for short- _ term/temporary needs in the national labour market; needs unable to be fulfilled by domestic sources. . The "overuse" (p. 2) of TFWP is recognized in the Government Response, identified by the "growing volumes" of the program. Curiously, however, this distortion is attributed to difficulties faced by employers on accessing "skilled permanent -residents" (p. 2), and the correction of the problem is seen to be achieved through initiatives implemented by the government with the goal to: "improve employers' access to skilled permanent residents and thereby lessen the reliance on the TFWP" (p. 2). The measures included the prioritization of applicants in the economic class
a~er

2008 and

the creation of the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) program. CEC is described in the Government Response on the following terms:

The CEC facilitates the transition to permanent residence for international students and TFWs [Temporary Foreign Workers] . who possesses skilled work experience in Canada, have sufficient . knowledge of English or French- and may have earned a Canadian educational credential. Indeed, research has demonstrated that these factors facilitate the integration and movement of new immigrants in the labour market. (Government Response, 2009, p. 2). The statement above partially responds to the request made in the CIMM Report for implementation/improvement of pathways leading to permanent residency "for all

31

temporary foreign workers" (CIMM Report, Recommendation #6, p. 56). It limits the qualified TFWs to students and skilled workers. The opportunity for low-skilled migrants to apply for residence was denied and justified in the following terms in the Goverriment Response (2009): ( ... ) lower-skilled workers generally have limited training, transferable skills and linguistic abilities, which mean adapting to changing conditions and finding their way around in the Canadian labour market, could be more of a challenge. Moreover it does not appear that a broad-based long-term need for lower-skilled workers exists across Canada to the same extent that experts and stakeholders have identified for skilled workers. Nevertheless, where provinces and territories have identified them as sectorru. and regional priorities, pathways to permanent residence for lowerskilled workers exist through the PNP [Provincial Nominee Program] (p. 2).
c

The above statement reveals some tendencies of the current immigration policy in Canada. First, the alleged inability of low-skilled migrants in adapting to the labour market is the counterpart of a policy that 'presents the ideal immigrant as skilled and educated. This ready-to-go prototype of immigrant does not require investments in public policy (integration,' settlement), education, training, or language and is unlikely to become a "social problem" for presenting conditions (employment, education) similar to the mainstream popUlation. Second, the interpretation made by the government regarding

Only a small part of the Government Response is dedicated to a response to CIMM conclusions on non-status workers. There, in spite all aspects brought up in the CIMM report (contributions of workers, lack of legal pathways leading to permanence).
/'

'

only the pertinence of a regularization program is discussed, as seen below:

..
The situation of undocumented workers is a continuing concern for many nations, including Canada. The Government of Canada recogllizes that some of these workers may be vulnerable to exploitation and economic downturns and that some stakeholders ' see their potential for addressing labour market needs. However, as pointed out by the Committee, options for regularizing these non- ~ status workers, while at the same time maintaining program integrity, are limited. There are a number of legitimate avenues for foreign workers to enter the Canadian labour market. Regularizing those who failed to respect the terms and conditions of the program and remained in Canada through illegal avenues would be unfair to , all permanent resident applicants who have followed the proper process and are waiting to have their application processed (Government Response, 2009, p. 11)
~

A misleading claim made in the above statement is that non-status workers have several "legitimate avenues to enter the Canadian labour market". While this· applie~ for , temporary situations, it is not true for permanent opportunities. As discussed above, it is , mown that almost no channels exist for low:skilled workers to remain in Canada after exprration of th~ir temporary work permit.

in the Low-Skilled Pilot Project, and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program, do not lead to permanent residency. The transition .from Provincial Nominee Program (PNN) 'and permanent residency is questionable.· McLaughlin & Hennebry -(2010) observe that farmworkers are not usually nominated through the PNN: ( ... ) the use of this program merely serves to heighten worker precarity, as the workers vie for employer support and maybe willing to accept unsafe work or m,istreatment to get it" (p. 3). Assessing the performance of the PNN by comparing the numbers ofTFWs with the numbers of permanent residents through the PNN shows the lack of mobility between these programs. Taking the year of 2009 for example, while the numbers of TFWs in Ontario, B.C. and Alberta were 94,750,69,993, and 65,671 respectively (CIC, 2009), the respective number of permanent residents created through the PNN in the same provinces were 1,271,4,708, and 5,325 respectively (Annual Report to Parliament, 2010). Another idea implied in the text is that people would choose to remain in Canada without legal status because of their unwillingness to wait for their application to be processed. Although this may apply to some cases, the literature suggests that typically non-status individuals lack options for legally staying in Canada. For example, McLaughlin & Hennebry (2010), explain that farm workers in temporary worker programs wishing to stay in Canada have to become non-status as "no direct pathway between years of work and gaining citizenship status exists for this class of workers [SAWP and LSPp 8]; nor do they generally qualify under the immigration point system" (p.7). Similarly, Magalhiies et

immigrants with particular occupational experiences, official languages fluency, and university education" (n.p.). The idea that a non-status worker "jump the line" is further refuted by No-One is Illegal (2010): "Most of the non-status immigrants are skilled or semi-skilled workers who do not qualify under our point system so there is no queue for them." Further: Visit any. construction site, restaurant kitchen or downtown office tower after hours when the cleaning crew springs to action, and odds are you'll be sharing space with non-status workers. However, as working class immigrants, the majority don't qualify for permanent status due to Canada's exclusive immigration policies (Portuguese-Canadian National Congress, 2009, p. 2),

Th~ resemblance of the current inclusion/exclusion criteria on skills to past practices of immigration restrictions based on ethnicity, religion and cultural values (Abu-Laban & Gabriel, 2002) is inevitable. At minimum, it is a precarious social move for a country that so heavily relies on immigrants and on immigrant labour. Regarding specifically the. undocumented movement, divergent perceptions of Committee members could not be harmonized towards support of a regularization program. Despite that, certain compromise was observed in the measures suggested by
