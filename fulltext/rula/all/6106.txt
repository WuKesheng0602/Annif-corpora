OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS AND SAFETY AUDIT FOR EAST YORK TRAFFIC NETWORK By Sumit Bhasin Submitted to the Department of Civil Engineering at Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario on May 16th, 2007 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Civil Engineering, 2007 Project Supervisor: Dr. Bhagwant Persaud

Abstract
Enhancing the quality of road travel is one of the main challenges present day traffic engineers and planners face. Travel delays cause loss of millions of person hours each year; and the economic toll of road accidents is staggering. Thus, engineers are always looking at opportunities for reducing delays and accidents. This project evaluates the operational and safety deficiency in a traffic network of nine intersections in the East York region and recommends appropriate and feasible corrective measures. The first phase of the project deals with the evaluation of traffic operations in the network, using simulation and optimization techniques, while the second phase encompasses a road safety audit that attempts to reduce crashes and fatalities.

The study reveals that the majority of the intersections in the network are failing operationally,
,

with level of service (LOS) F typical. Although a reduction in delays is achieved by optimization, no substantive improvement in LOS can be obtained by optimization alone. It is recommended that geometry and operations of the critical intersections be altered to enhance quality of service. Analysis of collision data was supported by a site investigation; recommendations for improving safety include relocating traffic signs, improving pavement condition and lighting and installing additional traffic control devices.

Introduction

Transportation infrastructure represents one of the largest and most critical investments made today. The movement of goods and people is vital to social and economic development of a nation. The number of vehicles on the roads is ever increasing whereas the roads and the land available for building new roads is very limited. Managing, redirecting and decongesting traffic within the existing roads is a challenging task that traffic engineers and planners face today.

To streamline traffic-flow, reduce delays and make travel safer and more convenient for the daily' road-user, we first need to identifY the problem. Performance measurement provides critical information that helps detect potential problems and forms the basis for enforcing corrective measures (I).

The process of safety improvement involves network screening, site visits, collision and operational analysis. Delays at intersections are a major source of traffic congestion and in order to minimize vehicular delays at intersections, signal timings and phasing needs to be properly designed. Since manual analysis of traffic networks is a cumbersome and monotonous task, use of software is common in this era of technological advancement.

Traffic operations' software tools

availabl~

today have a wide range of applications;

encompassing highway capacity analysis procedures, simulation for evaluation of the impact of changing traffic patterns, network optimization, traffic impact studies and geometric designs.

For the road network, infrastructure performance is measured in three main categories: physical condition, operational efficiency and safety.

1.1

Objective

The aim of this project is to perform operational analysis and safety audit of a congested network of nine intersections in the East York region. The major area of interest in the network is the heavily congested Don Mills and O'Connor intersection where large inflow and outflow of traffic occurs to and from Don Valley Parkway. Commuters from outskirts of Toronto mostly use Don Valley Parkway to reach the Central Business District! Centreville of city of Toronto. As a result Don Valley Parkway and the Don Mills - O'Connor intersection is mostly found to be operating at capacity.

In this research I have made an effort to enhance safety and improve upon the level of service which will in tum provide reduction in fuel consumption and average delays faced by daily commuters. Transyt and Synchro software have been used' for simulation and optimization of the network. Site visits and analysis of collision data for last five years was performed in an effort to improve safety.

Site Selection
conges~ed

The selected road network comprises of nine signalized intersections situated in the area of East York, Toronto.

East York is a former suburb of Toronto. The area is populated with middle-c1ass and workingclass homes and is a major arrival point for immigrants, who have established their 'first Canadian residence in the Thomcliffe Park apartments (6). The chosen network is bounded by Donlands Avenue on West, Coxwell Avenue on' East, Mortimer A venue on South and O'Connor on North.

This site evolves a lot of interest for research because of its proximity to Don Valley Parkway. Don Valley Parkway is one of Toronto's busiest commuter routes which was built as part of a,' grand plan initiated in the 1950s. The highways plan never got completed because of downtown

2

obj ctions to several of the expressway routes, leaving DVP and the Gardi ner Ex pressway to carry the bul k of highway traffic into the core
(5).

The populatio n of the suburbs has grown treme ndously eversi nce and has had a toll on the volumes on the DVP, res ulting in frequent congesti on. Don Valley Parkway and the Do n M ills O' Connor intersection in our network is a focus area where bottlenecks are common and large scale attention is requ ired for alleviating the situ ation.

Report Organization

This report is organized in four chapters; Introduction, Literature Review, Network Analysis and Optimization, Audit Report and Observations; followed by Conclusion and References.

Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the project, its purpose and the relevance of taking up
the East York traffic network as the area of interest.

Chapter 2 summarizes the literature reviewed for the research. It includes case studies that
consolidate the significance of providing treatments to the network, followed by overview of traffic operations and safety audit and brief introduction of software used in the project.

Chapter 3 discuses site features, presents volume data and collision data provided by the City of
Toronto and details the methodology adopted. Network Analysis follows which provides summary of simulation and optimization results. Software analysis showed that little could be done to improve existing level of service as the traffic volumes are very high. Options for improvement included changing lane configuration, signal timings and phases; the results for which are summarized individually in the result analysis section of this report.

Chapter 4 presents the details of site investigation, backed up with pictures and graphical
analysis of collision data. The section also describes findings of the safety audit followed by recommendations.

The report finishes with the conclusions and references.

Literature review

The purpose of measuring perfonnance is to improve transportation services for customers

(9).

It

is a useful tool that can help infonn the public as well as decision makers and legislators regarding the importance and the merits of making appropriate investments in the transportation system
(8).

For the road network, the traffic engineers measure highway infrastructure

perfonnance in three main categories: physical condition, functional adequacy and utilization (9).

To support the purpose of this research, following cases were studied and it was concluded that optimization techniques when employed at appropriate sites result in improving level of service and corrective measures at accident prone sites improve safety of commuters.

The first portion of this report focuses on Level of Service analysis for which simulation modeling and optimization programs have been employed. Simulation techniques replicate conditions of the road and thus help in analyzing variety of complex vehicle interactions and evaluation of alternative treatments. The outputs obtained from the software are interpreted by traffic engineers and improvements are implemented.

Case Studies
(2)

In 2003, AI-Ghamdi

investigated a total of 1774 police-reported traffic accidents that occurred

in the period 1996-1998 in Riyadh. Analysis depicted that about 50% of severe accidents involved a pedestrian, indicating the need for protecting pedestrians in Riyadh. The analysis of accident causes in this study revealed that excess speed, failing to yield and disregarding the red light accounted for majority of all accident causes. The author concluded that reviewing and correcting existing intersection geometry for defects at the crash sites backed by strict law enforcement strategies and public education campaigns would help bring a reduction in crashes.

In 1997, Persaud et a1.

(10)

studied the impact of converting signalised one-way street

intersections in Philadelphia to all-way stop sign intersections. Empirical Bayesian procedure was used to estimate what would have been the impact on number of crashes if the intersections were not converted. On comparison of the Empirical Bayesian estimates with actual crash numbers after conversion, a 24% reduction in crashes was achieved. For all crash types, significant reductions were achieved for both day & night and percentage reduction in crashes involving severe injuries was substantially larger than those resulting in minor injuries.

In 2006, Sudani

(11)

conducted a road safety audit for a high risk corridor in the region of

Waterloo, Ontario. The audit involved a detailed study of the accidents in that corridor for years 2000-2005. Site investigation and in depth examination revealed the shortcomings in the geometric design and suggested relocation of traffic signs, improvement of lighting and installation of traffic control devices like red light cameras be done to improve safety.

In 2002, Abbas

(I)

provided an assessment of traffic safety conditions for rural roads in Egypt.

The author presented an analysis of accidents' causes which were categorized under six main categories, namely; driver related, pedestrian related, vehicle related, road related, environmentrelated causes and other causes. In the course of conducting the traffic safety assessment of rural roads in Egypt, the researcher suggested the lack of past sustainable and detailed accident data collection programs as well as a lack of accident prediction models. The author in his research developed a number of statistical models that could be utilized for prediction of the expected number of accidents, injuries, fatalities and casualties on the rural roads in Egypt.

In 2001, Eccles and Hummer (7) evaluated the safety effects of replacing existing yellow signs with fluorescent yellow warning signs at seven hazardous locations. A before and after study that used surrogate measures like signal violations, stopping behavior and speed, was conducted and it was found that use of fluorescent yellow sheeting in place of standard yellow sheeting provides an inexpensive method that increases conspicuity of the signs and helps increase safety. A

6

substantial reduction in crashes was achieved at four of the seven sites while at the other three, little change was observed. However, since surrogate measures were used, actual collision savings was unknown. The authors recommended further research to find collision savings and long term effects.

In 2007, Ourston

(4)

conducted a case study on roundabouts constructed at Meadowbrook

DrivelHamilton Drive in the village of Anc'aster (Hamilton) Ontario, Canada. The objective was to reduce speeds on Wilson Street; the roundabout was constructed, between the 50 kmlh (30 mph) speed limit in the village and the 80 kmlh (50 mph) approach from Highway 403 to the west. A spot speed study was conducted to determine speed profiles eastbound and westbound on Wilson Street at six locations before and after the roundabout was opened.

Table 2: Westbound Speed Profile

The study demonstrated that roundabout significantly reduced speeds eastbound on the highspeed approach before motorists reached the village. and westbound as they leave it. Roundabouts eliminate the potential for hazardous conflicts such as nght-angle and kft-turn head-on crashes and have fewer conflict points compared to conventional intersections. Lower speeds in roundabouts allow drivers more time to react to potential conflicts, helping to make roundabouts safer. Highly visible signs ami markings , conspicuous central landscaping, and adequate illumination are also recommended to reduce approach speeds and crash potential at roundabouts.

In 2005, Bauer et al.

(3)

conducted a before/after study of same-direction, four- or five-lane urban

freeways in California using the Empirical Bayes Method. The authors inferred that relieving congestion on an urban freeway by widening the existing roadbed to add an additional lane is a difficult and expensive option, however, re-striping the existing lanes, converting all or part of the shoulder to a travel lane, or a combination of both options is more practical. The study found that the accident frequency in four- to five-lane conversions was 10 to 11 percent, while smaller increases were demonstrated in five- to six-lane conversions. The authors attributed the increases in accident frequency to accident migration caused by relocation of traffic operational bottlenecks.

2.2

Traffic Operations

Traffic operations imply management of traffic on the road which encompasses controlling vehicles moving in conflicting directions by means of traffic signals, at the same time ensuring that no unnecessary delay occurs.

Traffic signals are control devices which can alternately direct the traffic to stop and proceed at intersections using red, yellow and green traffic light signals. The signals provide for orderly movement of traffic, increase the traffic handling capacity of intersections, reduce crashes, and increase the safety of pedestrian crossings.

The main objective of signal timing at the intersections is to reduce the average delays of all vehicles and the probability of crashes. The objective of reducing delay sometimes conflicts with the idea of crash prevention because number of phases need to be minimized for reduction of average delay, however, many additional distinct phases are required to eliminate conflicting movements of vehicles. Hence engineering judgment and experience needs to be res<?rted to at these times.

Traffic signals can operate in several different modes: · · Pre-timed Signal Control Traffic Actuated Signal Control · · Semi-Actuated Control Fully Actuated Control

Pre-timed signals are the simplest type of traffic signals in which the cycle length, the phases and all of the intervals are predetermined. Traffic-actuated control of intersections attempts to adjust green time continuously to handle fluctuating volumes. These adjustments occur in accordance with real-time measures of traffic demand obtained from vehicle detectors placed on the approaches to the intersection. Fully-actuated signals have detectors on all of the approaches· while semi-actuated signals have detectors on only some of the approaches.

10

To elaborate on the mechanism of actuated signal control; when the detector registers a vehicle it makes a call to the controller. The· controller then adjusts the phase lengths to meet the requirements of the prevailing traffic condition. When the detector is activated, it retains the right of way for a minimum time and allots additional time, if more cars are detected during the green light. Extensions are added to the phase, till it reaches the maximum green time. However, if no call is received during the green time, the phase ends. The cycle then progresses based on calls received and changes to the next phase in the phase sequence that has a call.

Another important aspect in traffic control is that of signal coordination. Coordinating signal timing allows a system of signals to work together so that vehicles are able to move through the signals without stopping. Good signal coordination can generate measurable safety benefits in two main ways. Firstly; coordinated signals produce platoons of vehicles that can proceed without stopping at multiple consecutive signalized intersections. Reducing the number and .frequency of required stops and maintaining constant speeds for all vehicles reduce rear-end conflicts. Secondly; signal coordination can improve the operation of turning movements. Increased platooning can create more gaps of greater lengths for vehicle movements at intersections and can result in improved intersection operation which means reduced energy consumption and lesser pollution.

11

2.3

Transyt

TRANSYT-7F (TRAffic Network StudY Tool, version 7, Federal) is complete traffic signal timing optimization software for traffic networks which can cater extremely complex traffic conditions. TRANSYT has the capability of optimizing cycle length, phasing sequence, splits, and offsets. The program accepts user inputs on signal timing and phase sequences, geometric conditions, operational parameters, and traffic volumes (13).

To elaborate the data input procedure; we divide roads and lanes into links with shared signals and shared traffic movements, assign a saturation flow to each link, indicate the maximum traffic flow over the stop line during the green time and enter the signal timings that apply to each link. The output includes the maximum capacity, the degree of saturation, the maximum queue length during the cycle for each of the links.

For simulation, the program takes the inputs as fixed variables and reports the perfonnance measures in terms of stops, delay, fuel consumption, and queuing.

Transyt can also optimise signal timings over the network to reduce delays, stops, and fuel consumption and total operating cost. When optimizing, TRANSYT-7F minimizes or maximizes an objective function, called the Perfonnance Index (PI). The PI may be a combination of delay and stops; fuel consumption; and/or optionally selected excessive\maximum back of queue, excess operating costs, or progression opportunities (13,16).

TRANSYT-7F is also available in both DOS and Windows 95INT versions.

12

2.4

Synchro

Synchro is a traffic signal timing tool designed to optimize cycle lengths, splits, offsets, and phase orders. Synchro requires mostly the same traffic flow and geometric data as Transyt-7F. The program can be used to evaluate existing traffic signal timing or to optimize settings for individual intersections, arteries, or a network.
\

The program performance measures include average approach delay, intersection delay, volumeto-capacity ratio, intersection level of service, total stops, travel time, emissions, and fuel consumption. Synchro offers a variety of user-specified reports, including capacity analysis, LOS, delay, stops, fuel consumption and signal timing settings (13).

Synchro's unique visual displays, including an interactive platoon dispersion diagram allow the user to can change the offsets and splits with a mouse, and observe the impacts on delay, stops, and LOS for the individual intersections, as well as the entire network.

Further, the program also optimizes multiple cycle lengths and performs coordination analysis in which Synchro determines which intersections need to be coordinated and those that should run free. The decision process is based on an analysis of each pair of adjacent intersections to determine what is called the "Coordinatability Factor" (CF) for the links between them. , Synchro's "Coordinatability Analysis Report" shows each factor that affects CF along with the effect it has on the CF. CF ranges from 0 to 100 or more. Any value above 50 means that coordination is recommended. The higher the CF, the more likely that segment will benefit from coordination.

Another significant strength of Synchro is its ability to create data input streams for Transyt-7F and CORSIM. Once the user has entered the data to run Synchro successfully, it is possible to run anyone of these programs without using any of their pre-processors (13).

Synchro runs under Windows 95INT and OS/2.

2.5

Safety Audit

Traffic accidents are a cause of concern world·wide. Massive sums of money are being spent on emergency care, rehabilitation, and other costs that result from traffic collisions (Health Canada estimates that Canada spends $25 billion every year on costs related to road collisions). Besides the monetary expense, road crashes cause loss of life and suffering as many are left crippled for rest of their lives. The World Health Organization reports that an estimated million people are killed and over forty million injured around the world, every year due to traffic collisions.

Policy makers, road safety professionals and engineers are working to reduce the risk and cost of collisions and are conducting road safety audits that aim at identification of safety problems and '" suggestion of corrective measures.

Road Safety Audit entails an in·depth engineering study of a road using road safety principles improve safety and with the purpose of identifying cost-effective countermeasures that would , operations for all road users
(15).

Safety audits are generally most effective when conducted at

locations where a high collision risk has been identified.

To elaborate the methodology of conducting an audit; it includes a comprehensive review of collision history, geometric characteristics, and traffic operational efficiency, and could also
I,

include traffic conflict observations and a human factors assessment.

Network Analysis & Optimization

Network Analysis includes determination of traffic operational efficiency. Simul ation and Optimization software like Transyt and Synchro have been used in this research to determine Level of Service of the intersections in the network. Before elaborating on the methodology and discussion of analysis's results, I shall first provide a brief overview of the features of the site along with the sources from where the data has been acquired.

3.1

Site Features

Land-use in the region is mostly dominated by closely packed residences. Land areas are occupied by apartments. mixed-housi ng and small-business neighborhoods. Immediately north of the region , there is a huge employment area north of Overlea and south of Eglinton, and there are mixed-use areas south of the region, all along and south of Danforth as depicted in the figure below. More than half the houses bui lt are apart ments and rest is a mix of row houses and semidetac hed units . T he regio n has schools and a hospital. Land use and community desi gn have had an impact on mode choice. Auto remai ns the preferred mode of travel. As a result of the current scenario, with increasing rate of population and empl oyment growth in the region ex isting roadway facilities are qui te insufficient.

Data Collection

The site of selected road network was inspected for collection of signal timing data during P.M. peak period. Road geometry & lane configurations were also observed in the field. Cycles were observed for each intersection. From the field survey, it was observed that all of the signals are pre-timed with two splits. The signal cycle length was observed to be 100 seconds for all intersections. The traffic data pertaining to the volume, composition of vehicles and pedestrians was taken from the records of City of Toronto.

Distance between intersection to intersection was not field measured and was taken from help online. For speed limit, posted limits on the streets were coded. For major streets 50 kmIhr was used. For the minor streets, 40 kmIhr. was used. For the unsignalized intersections, traffic volumes were not provided by the City of Toronto. For the purpose of coding, traffic volumes at the unsignalized intersections were calculated by balancing the traffic from the nearest intersections.

3.2.1 Volume Data
Volume data was provided by City Of Toronto - Traffic Data Centre & Safety Bureau. The Turning Movement Count Summary Report included
intersectio~,

volumes by direction, time

period and by vehicle type. The volume data was fed into the simulation software for performance measurement after which corrective countermeasures could be implemented. ,

It is important to note that the precision of the calculated LOS depends on the accuracy of the

data collected and the methods adopted for data collection. Thus accuracy and detail of Jrban street network data is of extreme importance. Good data holds the key to good decision making; Due to the amount of information and spatial & temporal characteristics of data, a large amount of resources are needed for collection of urban network data. To ensure quality of data, it is recommended that programs for quality assurance be established and agencies that collect and manage data be held accountable.

Methodology

Level of service is measured in reference to delay at an intersection taking all turning volumes into account. It is the fundamental factor that contributes to the congestion and overall network performance. Transportation engineers determine measures to minimize the delay by analyzing and designing proper phasing, signal timing and lane configuration at the intersections. There are various tools and software available today to assist engineers in their effort to enhance the road network performance. This project represents the analysis of a typical heavily congested East York area network by using Transyt and Synchro with real facts and figures. The methodology adopted for traffic operational analysis by use o~ software is as follows: At first, field measured data is fed to the network in the software package and performance of the existing network evaluated, this is referred to as base condition. The signal offset optimization is then performed to improve the current level of service. To elaborate the procedure; first the lane configurations are input, then traffic volumes, followed by signal timing and phase configuration of each intersection.

Simulation for the network resulted in errors because the volume data input in the software did not cater the traffic coming from unsignalized intersections in the network. Volume balancing was done for both routes of the network and simulation was run.

The file was then executed for optimization in order to optimize the splits and cycle lengths.'f!1e
optimiz~d

parametric data was again fed into the software to get the modified or optimized

system performance.

The next section would elaborate software analysis along with the results and recommended countermeasures.

Analysis

A detailed analysis was perfonned with different strategies to enhance the LOS for the network for which traffic volume data was obtained from the City of Toronto, and signal timing plans, lane configurations, were detennined from the field. This study is perfonned in two different stages. The first approach is to assess the existing condition of the network and problem identification. The second approach involves assessment of changes in the level of service using optimized signal splits and optimized cycle lengths followed by development of effective alternatives to resolve the problem.

3.4.1

Transyt Analysis

Base Case Assessment and Optimization Results for Transyt: The base case evaluation showed O'Connor Avenue was the most poorly perfonning arterial -with 2 signalized intersections at LOS F and 1 intersection at LOS E. The optimization improved the average delays to an extent with appreciable improvement only at Coxwell & O'Connor where the LOS changed from F to E. Two other failing intersections in the network remained at F; however, the average delay times were improved. No Name Fuel Consumption (lit) Opt. Sim. Average' Delay (sec/veb) Opt. Sim.

Table above shows Transyt simulation and split optimization results which lead us to development of rectification techniques. As seen from the results, split optimization alone does little to improve level of service so I shall now take up individual intersections case by case and try various options to reduce delays and better level of service.

Coxwell & Mortimer

Coxwell & Mortimer was node 1 of the network and had level of service D which is generally acceptable. Eastbound through traffic had greater delays due to higher traffic volumes and had an LOS ofE but overall intersection was seen to function smoothly.

Coxwell & 0' Connor

Coxwell and O'Connor is an intersection that needs immediate attention. This intersection experiences large delays and has large number of crashes as well. The cause of the problem at this intersection is excessive eastbound through traffic which results in an LOS of F. Optimization in Transyt reduced average delays in individual directions and improved LOS of the intersection from F to E. EB T WB T NB R L T R L SB T

Since optimization for splits and cycle length did not help reduce delays significantly, alteration in intersection geometry and lane configuration was resorted to. Options tried were introducing tum bay storage of 8 vehicles to the right tum lane in northbound direction and making northbound left tum exclusive. These directions had excessive traffic which caused congestion at the intersection. These changes made significant improvement in LOS and brought down intersection average delay from 94 seconds per vehicle to 36 seconds per vehicle. LOS achieved after adoption of countermeasures was D.

Simulation results show an LOS of E for the intersection which is generally acceptable. Optimization of existing conditions was done but it did not help reduce delays for the intersection. To improve LOS, intersection parameters were changed and input in Transyt. Factors were considered individually to determine the effect of each in improving the quality of traffic flow. Alterations made were addition of a hypothetical lane in eastbound direction and addition of protected left turning phase. Signal splits were also changed but little was achieved to better the intersection LOS despite all these alterations. EB T WB R L T NB L T R SB T

To alleviate the traffic situation, variety oflane configurations were input and simulation was run for O'Connor and Donlands. Addition of 6 & 4 turn bay storage for left & right turn respectively for southbound traffic and addition of left turn bay storage of 8 vehicles for westbound traffic was done. No changes were made to phasing or signal timings. The results improved LOS as it changed from an initial F to D.

Synchro implements Intersection Capacity Utilization method for determining intersection capacity. It compares current volumes to the intersection's maximum capacity. Intersection Capacity Utilization is similar to but not the same as intersection volume to capacity ratio. A value less than 100% indicates that the intersection has extra capacity. A value greater than . 100% indi~ates the intersection is over capacity operate over 100% ICU.

Measures of effectiveness in Synchro include delays, stops, fuel consumption and emissions and a variety of reports can be printed for analysis of simulation/optimization results. Majority of intersections in the network experience huge delays and are seen to have an LOS of F which is the lowest measurement of efficiency for a road's performance with every vehicle moving in lockstep with the vehicle in front of it.

The results in Transyt and Synchro analysis'are similar and hence same treatment for the failing intersections is recommended. Note that differentiate congested operation (12).

Figure 6: Synchro street network showing CF and street names

Synchro software calculates a factor to determine whether or" not coordination between intersections should be done. This factor is called Coordinability Factor (CF), which ranges from

o to 100 or more. A CF value over 50 means that coordination is recommended. The higher the
CF, the more likely it is that segment will benefit from coordination.

CF takes travel times between intersections into account. Synchro recommends coordination if the travel time between intersections is less than 30 seconds
(12).

Figure 6 shows CF for, the

streets on the intersection and it is clearly shown that streets joining intersections 1 & 9 and 4 & 5 have CF equal to 21 and 31 respectively; thus Synchro does not recommend coordination for them.

Audit Report & Observations

This audit report shall include analysis of collision data for each of the intersections showing high number of collisions. Only after detailed study of conditions and factors that have contributed to the crashes, recommendations for treatment shall be given. I would start by giving a brief introduction of safety audit and enumerate the steps involved in the exercise.

A road safety audit is an in-depth engineering study of an existing road with the objective of identifying cost-effective countermeasures that shall improve traffic operations and road safety
(I5)

It generally has a standard operating procedure which is as follows:

· · · · · ·

Network screening for identification of high risk corridor Data collection Detailed study of collision data for previous years Level of Service analysis Identification of safety concerns by site visits and comprehensive investigations Providing recommendations to better safety

Having reviewed the collision data (courtesy-City of Toronto Collision Reporting System) for the intersections in the chosen network, it is observed that Coxwell, 'O'Connor and Donlands are three streets that have high number of collisions. So before conducting a detailed safety audit for the same, I shall provide a graphical analysis of the collision data to understand the factors and conditions that have contributed to the frequency of collisions and accordingly appropriate countermeasures are enforced.

Figure 12: Collisions by hour - Coxwell & Cosburn Figure 12 shows that large portion of collisions have taken place in the morning and evening rush hour. A unique observation is that 7 collisions have taken place at 2pm in last 5 years. This number could be attributed to the existence of East York Collegiate Institute right at the junction where student drop-off and pick up has been permitted at the road side.

4.2

Site visit:

The first site visit took place on March 2, 2007 in the evening peak hour. The purpose of the visit was to collect physical data, lane configuration, speed limits and to conduct a general reconnaissance of the region.

The second visit was made on April 6, 2007 from 12 noon to 4 PM. Detailed investigation of road conditions was done and potential safety hazards were recorded. Pictures of the site were taken so that careful analysis could be done and fitting corrections could be put into effect.

The safety audit site is in a mixed residential and a commercial area with ever increasing traffic growth because of proximity to Don Valley Parkway and the existence of a hospital and school in the area. Poor level of service and starvation delays at most of the intersections especially on the 0' Connor avenue is a cause for concern.

4.3

General Findings of the Audit:

The site investigation found that the following were the most common ,safety concerns in the area audited: · · · Inadequate pavement markings Insufficient lighting Improper land development (property lines extended right up to the pavement edge obstructing turning vehicle's sight at the junctions) · " Too many driveways close to intersection · Poor location of signs

These along with poorly performing signals were the deficiencies found in the survey; delays and congestion contributed to erratic driver behavior and increased safety risks as it was observed that large number of collisions occurred in the morning rush hou,r. ,

I shall now provide intersection specific findings and recommendations based on· software analysis and site investigation. The hazards have been shown clearly in the pictures that follow.

48

Coxwell & Mortimer:

Figures 31 & 32: Road side parking at Coxwell & Mortimer

Figures 31 and 32 show that there is parking allowed on both sides of the road which limits the capacity and because there is no center lane provided for vehicle entry to the hospital, turning vehicles block the road for through traffic.

Figures 33 & 34: No provision for bus bay - Coxwell & Mortimer

Figure 33 shows bus stop right at the intersection and no bus bay provided whereas there is plenty of available space, also made clear by Figure 34. Recommendations for this intersection are provision of bus bays to allow free movement of through traffic. This shall increase throughput and reduce delays. Also provision of center lane for entry and exit from the hospital shall better safety as conflicts shall be reduced.

Figure 35: Sign hidden by overgrown tree - Coxwell & Cosburn
A number of recommendatIOns can be suggested to reduce collisions at this intersection Signs need to be mauc more
conspicuou~ ;

Figure 35 shows that speed limit sIgn has been

blocked by an overgrown tree. A big flaw observed at the mtersection was student pick up and drop-off area at the major street which blocks traffic and causes unnecessary delays (Refer Figure 36). The East York Collegiate Institute has a big parking lot which remains underutilizeu. Road side stopping poses a potential safety hazard which can be done away with easily.

Figure 36: Student pick up & drop-off area at Coxwell & Cosburn

50

Figure 37: View of Coxwell & Cosburn intersection
Dust bin and Canada Post mail collection box have been placed very close to the edge of pavement which block the right turning traffic's view and are therefore a potential hazard for pedestrian collisions

Figure 38: No bus bay provided at Coxwell & Cosburn
Traffic queuing occurs due to the bus stop location ; either the bus stop should be located further back or a bus bay should be provided to better safety and reduce delays. Plenty of space is available for bus bay provision.

51

Coxwell & O'Connor:

Figure 39: Speed limit sign needs relocation- Coxwell & O'Connor
The maximum speed sign is awkwardly positioned; relocating the sign to improve visibility would help better safety for the intersection. Reverse parking is being used which should be replaced by parallel parking as the reversing vehicles block the roadway increasing delays and also increasing conflicts.

Figure 40: No bus bay at Coxwell & O'Connor
Figure 40 also shows the available space just next to the bus stop (located south of O'Connor- Coxwell intersection) which should be ideally utilized by providing a bus bay. Due to proximity of the bus stop to the intersection, the bus bay would alleviate queuing and improve flow of traffic.

52

figure 42 shows oncoming traffic from gas station which creates conflicts and increases probability of collisions. While there i~ space available as shown in Figure 41, an extra center lane would have bettered safety by accommodating transition of vehicles from gas station with the street flow.

O'Connor & Don Mills:
This is one of the major focu s areas in the network. It accommodates outgoing and incoming traffic to and from the Don Valley Parkway.

Figure 43: Queues at O'Connor & Don Mills
As evident from the Figure 43 and 44, long queues hold traffic from getting on to and from the DVP. Queues line up as far as the adjacent intersection causing starvation delays. Figure 44 shows presence of an access point right next to the junction which causing conflicting movements.

Figure 45: Pavement needs reconditioning at O'Connor & Don Mills

Pavement quality needs to be upgraded Cracks and potholes in pavement are commonly found on approaches to the intersection. Pavement markings need to be repainted :.is well. The signs need to be re-Iocated to a place where they are more visible. Also some of the signs need re-painting like the one above the driveways sign. Regulations on these signs are hardly visible. Presence of large number of driveways on intersection approach also increases chances of side swipe and angle collisions .

Figure 46: Signs need relocation - O'Connor & Don Mills
55

0' Connor & Donlands:

Figure 47: Signs need to be relocated - 0' Connor & Donlands
0' Connor & Donlands recorded a total of 60 accidents in a 5 year period (2002-2006) which shows the need for a comprehensive safety analysi s for the site The signs need to be relocated to a conspicuous and safe place; the direction sign Jue to its low height has been struck by a truck as shown in Figure 47. Figure 47 shows existence of too many driveways close to the junction which increases prob<: bility of potential side swipe collisions. Reverse parking is in effect (Refer Figure 48); if repJaced by parallel parking it would better safety. Pavement needs to be reconditioned; pot holes and cracks are plentiful.

Figure 48: Pot holes and cracks at 0' Connor & Donlands

56

Figure 49: Congestion - 0' Connor & Donlands

The stop line should be pulled back as the vehicles on the stop line block the turnil1g traffic (Refer Figure 49) . As many 20 turning movement accidents have been recorded at this intersection in years 2002-2006 (Refer Collision Data graphical analysis).

Figure 50: Long queues close to 0' Connor & Donlands

Due to proximity of adjacent intersection and high volumes, starvation delays are frequent and queuing extends as far as the next intersection.

57

Cosburn & Donlands:

Figure 51: No bus bays at Cosburn & Donlands
As found in many of the other intersections inspected, no hus bays have been provided here as well. The stop is very close to the junction and hence blocks traffic flow and increases delays for auto users. The electric pole and its supporting cables (yellow color) block pedestrian walkway and could be a potential hazard to pedestrian safety.

Figure 52: View of Cosburn & Donlands intersection
As evident from Figure 52 the fire station is extended right up to the edge of pavement and there exists a bus stop very close to the access of the fire station. This poses a safety threat as it could lead to delays and congestion close to the junction. The bus stop should either be moved further away from the intersection or a bus bay should be installed so it does not block the roadway.

58

Conclusions

In this study, a network of nine intersections in East York was selected for review for potential operational and safety improvement. This review was desirable because geometric and operational characteristics had become incompatible with present travel demands that have grown dramatically due to rapid growth in population, employment and land use. Simulation and optimization techniques were used to assess and improve existing level of service (LOS) for the intersections. For the safety review, the adopted approach was based on the "Road Safety Audit Guide" developed by Transportation Association of Canada (TAC). Site visits were performed to investigate lane configuration, phasing sequence and signal timing. Traffic volumes and collision data were provided by City of Toronto.

The data were analysed using Transyt and Synchro software to establish the level of service of the nine intersections in the network. Simulation and optimization in Transyt-7F revealed that, during the morning rush period, three out of the nine intersections in the network were failing with a LOS of F, while there was one intersection each with LOS of D and E, respectively. LOS of F was obtained for five intersections in Synchro simulation of the same data period. Although a reduction in delays was obtained through optimization, no significant change in level of service was achieved without altering lane configuration and geometry.

An analysis of collision data revealed three intersections- Coxwell Avenue, O'Connor Road

and Donlands Avenue- as the most poorly performing streets in the entire network and pointed to a need for a detailed investigation of these intersections for possible safety improvement. The investigation revealed numerous safety problems and potential treatments such as relocation of traffic signs, re-timing signals, addition of bus bays, installation of active signals and replacing intersections with roundabouts. Further to these treatments, enhancing programs of law enforcement with public information and education campaigns would facilitate safety improvement in the network.
