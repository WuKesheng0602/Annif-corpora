Abstract
Corporations are under growing pressure from socially responsible investors to consider the environmental and social impacts of their operations. To help highlight corporations that have taken steps to address these issues, a number of sustainability indices have been developed. While there is a growing body of literature that focuses on sustainability indices, little is known on how they are used in practice. The purpose of this project was to explore the use of

sustainability indices in corporations. In this project, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America (DJSINA) was used as a case study. The project consisted of three key phases: a content analysis of corporate sustainability reports in North America, a survey with Canadian experts on the DJSINA, and a review of the DJSI website. The project highlights the similarities and differences in the use of the DJSI by Canadian and American corporations. As the first study focusing on the use of the DJSINA, the results will be of interest to practitioners and academics in socially responsible investment and corporate sustainability.

1. Introduction

1.1

Overview
A growing number of investors view sustainability as a crucial success factor in overall

corporate performance. Many now prefer to invest in companies that implement sustainable development (SO) principles through a structured corporate sustainability program. This is

reflected in the growing trend towards socially responsible investment (SRI). There are two reasons for this interest. First, the concept of corporate sustainability itself is attractive to

investors since it aims to increase long-term shareholder value. Second, sustainability leaders are increasingly expected to show strong performance and favourable risk/return profiles. As a result, SO is now increasingly applied at the corporate level around the world. To provide investors with insight into corporate sustainability performance, a number of sustainability indices have been developed. The most widely-applied of these indices is the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). It is explicitly intended to provide a bridge between

companies implementing sustainability practices and investors wishing to achieve high return with less risk. The DJSI provides a measure of the financial performance of companies However, many questions remain on how

worldwide that lead the field of sustainability.

corporate sustainability indices are actually used in practice. This research study aims to address this gap. The study provides insight into their role in investment decision making, measurement of economic, environmental, and social performance, and competitive benchmarking. Since it is the most widely-used corporate sustainability index in North America, the research focuses on the use of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America (DJSINA) in individual corporations.

1.2

Problem Statement
Recently, there has been a substantial amount of worldwide attention on the word

sustainability. The term sustainable development became widely used through the work of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), otherwise known as the 'Brundtland Commission'. The Commission was concerned with merging environmental

sustainability with social and economic development.

From the Brundtland Commission

emerged a document entitled 'Our Common Future' in which SO was defined as "development that meets the needs of the future without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (WCED, 1987). Through the work of the Brundtland Commission, corporate sustainability was also defined as "a business and investment approach that seeks to use the best business practices to meet and balance the needs of current and future stakeholders" (WCED, 1987). One of the keys to understand SO and to assess progress towards corporate sustainability is performance measurement (PM). Sustainability indicators have been designed to measure

company performance and to provide information on how a company contributes to SO (Azapagic & Perdan, 2000). Indicators play an important role in translating sustainability issues into quantifiable measures. Indicators are useful in identifying trends and drawing attention to particular issues. They can also be helpful in setting policy priorities and in benchmarking or monitoring performance (Azapagic, 2004). Since stakeholders want business to be accountable, responsible, and transparent, sustainability reporting has been developed to help address these needs (WBCSD, 2002). Sustainability reporting is about sharing the organization's progress and results with its stakeholders with an emphasis on integrating financial, environmental, and social performance of a company in one report. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is intended to serve as a "The GRI includes standard

generally accepted framework for sustainability reporting.

disclosures, made up of performance indicators and other disclosure items, as well as guidance on specific technical topics to address in reporting" (GRI, 2010). The voluntary nature of the publications explains the high variability in the contents of sustainability reports and the wide range of disclosed information. When it becomes difficult to make a decision based on a wide variety of individual indicators with different units, a composite index may be used. A composite index is defined as that which should "ideally measure multidimensional concepts which cannot be captured by a single indicator, such as competitiveness, industrialization, or sustainability" (OECD, 2008). Composite indices are increasingly recognized as a useful tool in policy analysis and public communication. They also provide simple comparisons of companies that can be used to

illustrate complex issues in wide-ranging fields, such as the environment, economy, society or technological development (Saltelli, 2007). However, others find that composite indices might send misleading policy messages if they are poorly constructed or misinterpreted (OEeD, 2008). The DJSI, launched September 1999, is "the first global sustainability index tracking the performance of the leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide" (DJSI, 2010). The DJSl explicitly focuses on the concept of corporate sustainability. It has been claimed that it includes the most successful methodology to identify the leading corporate sustainability performance (CSP) firms from each industry sector (Carleton, 2009). The DJSI was developed by the

Sustainable Asset Management (SAM) Group, a Zurich based fund management firm that remains responsible for administering the selection criteria (Fowler and Hope, 2007). The

corporate sustainability assessment methodology is structured to cover the three major dimensions of corporate sustainability: the economic, the social, and the environmental dimensions and to measure and verify the CSP of the companies in the investable universe (Knoepfel, 2001). Although there has been increasing interest in sustainability indices in the past few years from investors and companies, there is still a substantial gap in the literature on how sustainability indices are used in practice (Fowler and Hope, 2007). Moreover, the steps taken by companies to be included in a sustainability index or to keep their inclusion in it have not been previously investigated (Fowler and Hope, 2007). Although sustainability indices sometimes emerge in corporate sustainability reports, little is known about how they can play a role in corporate decision making, the measurement of economic, environmental, and social performance, or to benchmark against industry peers. This research addresses these gaps in depth by providing a detailed case study on the DJSINA.

1.3

Purpose and Research Objectives
In In

The purpose of this research is to explore the use of corporate sustainability indices corporations. The research presents an investigation on the use of sustainability indices

corporations through a systematic research literature review and a content analysis of corporate sustainability reports. The results of the literature review and content analysis provided a basis for the development of a survey to obtain perspectives from corporate experts and to explore

3

gaps in the literature. The investigation focuses on the DJSI as a case study, because of its relatively early launch date and its widespread use in practice. objectives are summarized as follows: 1. To explore how the use of the DJSI is explained in corporations; 2. To examine how the use of the DJSI differs by country; 3. To determine the steps taken by corporations to achieve acceptance by the DJSI; and 4. To find out how selected corporations maintain their inclusion in the DJSI. Hence, the main research

1.4

Research Scope

The review of the literature covers articles published since the release of the Brundtland Commission report in 1987. The DJSI website is thoroughly reviewed to identify data for original analysis. The content analysis of corporate sustainability reports focuses on companies listed in the DJSINA. Finally, the survey focuses on Canadian experts at companies listed in the DJSINA.

1.5

Organization of the Project Paper

The project paper is organized into five remaining chapters. The next chapter contains a literature review exploring the existing definitions of sustainability, corporate sustainability, corporate sustainability performance, sustainability reporting, corporate sustainability indicators, composite indices, sustainability indices, and finally, the DJSI is discussed in detail. The

literature review provides insight into the role of corporate sustainability indices in corporations and highlights the existing gaps. The third chapter identifies the main research questions. The fourth chapter presents the methods thatÂ· are used to address the research questions: data gathering and data analysis procedures are discussed in detail along with the description of the sample. The fifth chapter presents the results and discussion. Finally, the sixth chapter provides conclusions and recommendations for future research.

2. Literature Review

2.1

Introduction
This chapter summarizes the literature pertaining to the different aspects of the research

project. The first section briefly introduces the concept of sustainability. The second section discusses corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability performance and sustainability

reporting are briefly discussed in sections three and four. A description of the development of corporate sustainability indicators, composite indices, sustainability indices, and the relevant research efforts are presented in sections five and six. The majority of the research studies reviewed in the last sections are conducted on the DJSI, its assessment methodology, monitoring process, and impact evaluation.

2.2

Sustainability
Although the term 'sustainable' has been used in the English language since at least 1290,

'sustainability' is rather new and first gained popular usage in 1972, rising to particular importance in the 1980s (Sumner, 2007). The literature provides rich coverage of what the idea of sustainability involves. For instance, Gorman et at (2000) proposed that "to sustain

something means to keep a phenomenon in existence." Sustainability is described as a condition of being or an aspiration, as well as a vision, such as that of economic stability or a clean environment (Sumner, 2007). It is also considered as an ethic. Others see it as a process, which means that it involves ongoing development or becoming without end (Sumner, 2007).
It has been claimed that the concept of sustainability is linked to nature, resource management

and the disciplines of biology and ecology. However, according to Farrell and Hart (1998), the aim is to change sustainability from being a buzzword to an understandable meaning for both the public and decision makers. As mentioned above, the term sustainability became more popular in the 1980s, particularly after a famous speech given by Lee Talbot, Director of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) International. He stated: "clearly, sustainability in the management of both individual wild species and ecosystems such as rangelands and forests is critical to human welfare and indeed to human survival" (Sumner, 2007). Over time, a series of activities have

5

been implemented that have led to the current understanding of SD. The term "sustainable development" became widely used after the Brundt1and Commission.
It has since been

developed into a blueprint for merging economic and ecological necessities (Brown et aI., 1988; Turner, 1988; Lowrance, 1990; Svedin, 1992). Daly (1991) and Moser et al. (1993) contributed to make this concept scientifically acceptable (Krotscheck and Narodoslawsky, 1995). Later, the WCED encouraged a variety of sectors, such as governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and community members to participate in ensuring progress towards SD and to assess the need for economically viable solutions and the management of natural resources (Dwivedi et a!., 2001).

2.3

Corporate Sustainability
Corporations have responsibilities to both their shareholders and stakeholders and it is

necessary to respect non-financial issues (Salizmann et aI., 2005). Therefore, businesses should align their activities with the principles of SD (Keeble et aI., 2003). Investors see sustainability as a crucial factor in overall business success and many are now investing in companies that set industry-wide best practices with regard to sustainabil ity (Knoepfel, 200 I). Corporate sustainability is fairly a new corporate management concept which recognizes that traditional goals, such as corporate growth and profitability, are important. However, it also requires the corporation to pursue societal goals, specifically those relating to SD, environmental protection, social justice, and economic development (Wilson, 2003). This leads to the complex task of providing competitive products and services in the short-term while seeking to protect and maintain the natural resources required for the future generations (Artiach et ai., 20 I 0). The expenses that firms gain as a result of applying sustainability practices may place them at an economic disadvantage comparing to others, less responsible firms, at least in the short term. However, these disadvantages diminish over time and sustainability practices acquire continuity and influence corporate performance positively with long term shareholder values (Lopez et aI., 2007). Since sustainability has a positive impact on company performance, corporate sustainability leaders all over the world have focused on developing sustainable products and services while at the same time successfully reducing costs and risks (Fowler and Hope, 2007). For example, they do their best to avoid providing products with huge amounts of waste and high

6

consumption of energy that undermine local communities or contaminate the environment and to enhance the 'three bottom line' (Grayson et aI., 2008). According to Wilson (2003), corporate sustainability borrows elements from four well-known concepts namely; I) SO; 2) corporate social responsibility (CSR); 3) stakeholder theory; and 4) corporate accountability theory. Based on Wilson's (2003) study, the four concepts are briefly discussed as follows: Â· The contribution of SD to corporate sustainability is twofold. First, it helps to set out the areas that companies should focus on: environmental, social, and economic performance. Second, it provides a common societal goal for corporations, governments, and civil society to work toward the 'three bottom line'. Â· Like SO, CSR is also a broad concept deals with the role of business in society. CSR management is very similar to corporate sustainability management, which aims to integrate the economic, environmental, and social aspects of business management. Its main belief is that corporate managers have an ethical responsibility to consider and address the needs of society. Â· Freeman (1984) defined a stakeholder as "any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives." The main goal of the stakeholder theory is to strengthen relationships between corporations and its external groups in order to achieve business objectives and to develop a competitive advantage. Â· Finally, the contribution of corporate accountability theory to corporate sustainability is that it helps define the nature of the relationship between corporate managers and the rest of society. Accountability is "the legal or ethical responsibility to provide an account or reckoning of the actions for which one is held responsible" (Wilson, 2003). Accountability differs from responsibility in that the latter refers to one's duty to act in a certain way. Although there is undoubtedly a strong interrelation between corporate sustainability and SO, it has been argued that SO by itself does not provide the actual means for what companies in action should look like. The WCED recognized that industry had a significant role to play in achieving SO. While corporations are responsible for economic development, they needed to balance this economic development with social justice and environmental protection. This is

7

mainly because they have access to most of the natural resources and they have been a major factor of some of the unsustainable conditions (Wilson, 2003). Industry's response to the WCED's call came in stages. The first serious sign of support came from the International Chamber of Commerce when it established its Business Charter for SD in 1990. This was followed in 1992 by the book "Changing Course'" by Stephen

Schmidheiny and the Business Council for Sustainable Development, now the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Since then, many investors and corporations have come forward to show their support for the principles of SD and a number of sustainability initiatives have been presented (Wilson, 2003).

2.4

Corporate Sustainability Performance

Corporate sustainability performance (CSP), "measures the extent to which a firm embraces economic, environmental, social, and governance factors into its operations, and ultimately they exert on the firm and society" (Artiach et al., 2010). Although sustainability has no common way of measuring it, it is necessary that corporations define and measure sustainability performance if they wish to be a source of value creation (Lopez et aI., 2007). Investment in CSP is highly beneficial to the organizations' economic growth and profitability. It adds value to any business in a number of ways: enhancing the reputation of the firm and making the firm a more attractive investment to socially responsible investors (Artiach et aI., 2010). Generally, socially responsible investors usually apply a social responsibility screen as part of their investment decision-making process (Artiach et al., 2010). They avoid businesses involved in alcohol,

tobacco, gambling, weapons, and the military. While financial performance is a key part of SRI, it emphasizes the practice of making investment decisions on the basis of ethical, social, and environmental criteria (Artiach et aI., 2010). It is widely recognized by corporate experts and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) that "what gets measured gets done and what people measure is what matters" (Carleton, 2009). By measuring sustainability, numerous benefits can be

achieved. For example, an organization can align employee actions with corporate objectives, provide consistent timely analysis of business performance, measure results, report consistently, and make faster and effective decisions (Sheehan, 20 I 0).

2.5

Sustainability Reporting
Since stakeholders want business to be accountable, responsible, and transparent,

sustainability reporting has been developed to help address these needs (WBCSO, 2002). Sustainability reporting is "the practice of measuring, disclosing, and being accountable to internal and external stakeholders for organizational performance towards the goal of sustainable development" (GRI, 2010). Sustainability reporting has grown rapidly over the last few years and now an increasing number of companies disclose information on the internet about their social and environmental performance to demonstrate a commitment to corporate sustainability (Perego, 2009). The disclosure of these information becomes a significant element in corporate management and therefore in its decision-making (Lopez et aI., 2007). Sustainability reports are continuing to emerge in corporate reporting, with an emphasis on integrating financial, environmental, and social performance of a company in one report. The GRI Framework is intended to serve as a generally accepted framework for reporting on an organization's economic, environmental. and social performance. "It was developed in 1997 by the environmental organization Ceres and the United Nations Environment Program. It was most recently updated in 2006 and has become the most widely used standard for reporting on social, environmental, and economic performance" (Bernhart, 2009). It is designed for use by organizations of any size, sector, or location. The framework contains general and sector-

specific content that has been agreed by a wide range of stakeholders around the world to be generally applicable for reporting an organization's sustainabiIity performance. "The GRl

Guidelines consist of principles for defining report content and ensuring the quality of reported information. It also includes standard disclosures made up of performance indicators and other disclosure items, as well as guidance on specific technical topics in reporting" (GRI, 20 I 0). Sustainability reports in general are often used for benchmarking, demonstrating how the organization influences and is influenced by expectations about SO, and comparing performance within an organization and between different organizations over time (GRI, 2010).

Corporate Sustain ability Indicators

There are many definitions of indicators in the literature; for example, "an indicator quantifies and simplifies phenomena and helps us understand complex realities. Indicators are aggregates

9

of raw and processed data but they can be further aggregated to form complex indices" (IISD, 20 10). While indicators can not provide information on everything about the system in question, they should provide enough information to make well decisions possible (Bossel, 1999). In particular, they ought to build the foundation for improved information and data collection and enable an analysis of progress towards identified goals (Spangenberg et aI., 2002). Indicators are useful in setting policy priorities and in benchmarking or monitoring performance. In general terms, indicators are designed to answer a fundamental question: "How might we know objectively whether things are getting better or worse?" (Neely, 1998). The development of sustainability indicators inside a firm remains an ongoing challenge (Searcy et aI., 2005). There are a number of issues that influence the development process, including the complex organizational structure, the business streams, functions, and projects (Keeble et aI., 2003). Therefore, a number of questions should be raised before developing sustainability indicators, such as how an organization can identify a suitable set of indicators, how effectively different levels of an organization are responsible and showing commitments to sustainability practice, and how an organization measures performance at operational levels where there are direct environmental, economic, and social impacts (Keeble et aI., 2003). The development of indicators in a corporate context has been explored by several authors, including Searcy et a1. (2005), Searcy (2009), Hubbard (2009), and Keeble et al. (2003). Previous research has also focused on the development of indicators in individual corporations (for example, Searcy et at. 2007, Palme and Tillman, 2008, and Kranjc and Glavic, 2005) and industry sectors (for example, Azapagic, 2004, IChemE, 2003, Nordheim and Barrasso, 2007, Veleva and Ellenbecker, 2001, and Upham and Mills, 2005). Kranjc and Glavic (2003), suggested a

standardized set of sustainability indicators for companies covering all main aspects of SO. To allow comparison between companies, they used ISO 31 (1993) as a guide.

2.7

Composite Indices

As previously mentioned, sometimes sustainability indicators are aggregated into a composite index. "A composite index should ideally measure multidimensional concepts which cannot be captured by a single indicator, such as competitiveness, industrialization, or sustainability" (OECD, 2008). Composite indices are much like mathematical or computational models.

Composite indices are increasingly recognized as a useful tool in policy analysis and public

10

iW-......

communication.

They also provide simple comparisons of companies that can be used to

illustrate complex and sometimes intangible issues in wide-ranging fields dealing with the environment, economy, society or technological development. It is also easier for the general public to understand and interpret composite indices than to identify common trends across many separate indicators, and they are also useful in benchmarking company performance (Saltelli, 2007). However, others see that composite indices may send misleading policy messages if they are poorly constructed or misinterpreted (OECD, 2008). In any case, there are many debates about whether indicators should be aggregated or not. A useful summary of the pros and cons of developing composite indices is provided by Nardo et al. (2008) and summarized in Table 2-1. Many scholars argue that there are two major reasons for combining indicators: (I) gaining media interest; and (2) gaining the attention of policy makers. However, others believe that one should stop once an appropriate set of indicators has been created and not go the further step of producing a composite index because the accuracy of the weighting process by which the variables are combined is a key challenge (Sharpe, 2004). The development of composite indices at the national level has been explored by several researchers, including Esty et al. (2005) and Wackernagel and Rees (1996), among others. Previous research has also focused on the development of sustainability indices at the regional level (for example, Dijk and Zhang, 2005 and Atkisson and Hatcher, 2001) and at the corporate level (for example, Kranjc and Glavic, 2005, Singh et al. 2007, and Pohl, 2006). Several

processes have been developed to create composite indices. One clear process is provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2008). For further details on developing a composite index, the interested reader is referred to Nardo et al. (2008).

Sustainability Indices

Numerous composite indices have been developed to assess progress towards sustainability. A sustainability index is simply a composite index defined as "a quantitative aggregation of many indicators and can provide a simplified, coherent, multidimensional view of a system" (Mayer, 2007). Sustainability indices provide objective benchmarks that are linked to economic, environmental, and social criteria. They have been developed specifically to support the

decision making process and to indicate whether a system or a process becomes less or more sustainable (Mayer, 2007). Sustainability indices are increasingly used by decision makers;

however, it is critical to understand index strengths, weaknesses, biases and scale-dependence 'weighting criteria' when using them (Oras, 2005; Hezri and Dovers, 2006; Parris and Kates, 2003; Morse and Fraser, 2005; Ness et aI., 2007). In his paper, Mayer (2007) said that "an index must track indicators from social, economic, and environmental dimensions of the system directly." Many sustainability indices have been developed. Although these indices look

different from each other, many of them incorporate the same underlying data because of the limited global sustainability database (Mayer, 2007). Kranjc and Glavic (2005) demonstrated that it is difficult to make business decisions based on a wide variety of indicators with different units and large numbers of performance measurements. Therefore, they proposed a

mathematical methodology to develop a composite SD index by aggregating a number of sustainability indicators. Due to the interest of investors in sustainability practices, a number of sustainability indices have been developed which linked to financial markets (Lopez et aI., 2007). Among them are the Jantzi Social Index (JSI), FTSE4Good Index, the FTSE KLD 400, which was formerly known as the Domini 400 Social Index, and the DJSI. The JSI is "a Canadian stock market

12

index created in 2000. It consists of 60 Canadian companies that pass a set of broadly based environmental, social, and governance rating criteria and the purpose is to measure the effect of a socially and environmentally conscious stock market index on market behaviour" (iShares, 2010). "The FTSE4Good Index Series has been designed to measure the performance of

companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards and to facilitate investment in those companies" (FTSE, 2010). The Domini 400 Social Index is composed of the stocks of 400 U.S. companies that pass comprehensive social and environmental screens (Domini Social Investments, 20 I 0).

2.9

The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family

The DJSI, launched September 1999, is "the first global sustainability index tracking the financial performance of the leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide" (DJSI, 2010). It consists of a global, European, North American, Asia Pacific, and Korean set of indices (DJSI, 20] 0). "The DJSI family consists of a broad composite index as well as narrower, subset indices excluding companies that generate revenue from alcohol, tobacco, gambling, armaments and firearms, and/or adult entertainment" (DJSI, 2010). These indices are developed to guide

assessments for the purpose of SRI. The DJSI explicitly focuses on the concept of corporate sustainability. The corporate sustainability assessment methodology, developed by SAM is

structured to cover the three major dimensions of corporate sustainability: the economic, the social, and the environmental dimensions and to measure and verify the CSP of the companies in the investable universe (Knoepfel, 2001). As a result of the increasing demand on sustainability benchmarks, the Dow Jones STOXX Sustainability Index for Europe's sustainability leaders was created in 2001, the DJSINA was created in 2005, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index was created in early 2009 (DJSI, 2010). The North American indices comprise the DJSINA and the Dow Jones Sustainability United States Index (DJSIUS), as well as other subset indices excluding companies that generate revenue from alcohol, tobacco, gambling, armaments and firearms as mentioned earlier. It is worth noting that there is no special index for the Canadian corporations. All indices of the DJSI family are assessed according to the same corporate assessment and respective criteria. This is discussed in the next sections (DJSI, 2010).

2.9.1 SAM Assessment Methodology
The identification of sustainability leaders for the DJSI is based on the corporate sustainability assessment of SAM. For the DJSINA, SAM selects the top 20% of leading CSP companies among the 600 largest companies from Canada and the U.S. in the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index (DJGTSM) that lead the field in terms of sustainability. SAM collects information about companies' annual sustainability progress through four different sources (OJSI, 2010), which are summarized in Table 2-2.

TabJe 2-2: SAM's sources of information (DJSI, 2010)
SAM Questionnaire Company Documentation Media, Stakeholders, and all Public Information Personal Contacts with Companies
It is distributed to the CEOs of all the companies in the DJSINA. Then, the completed questionnaires have to be signed by a senior company representative. It includes sustainability reports, environmental reports, health and safety reports, social reports, annual financial reports, and other sources of company in formation. SAM's analysts review media, press releases, articles, and stakeholder observations written about a company over the past two years. An analyst can contact individual companies to discuss issues arising from the questionnaire, company documents, or stakeholder analysis.

2.9.2 Criteria and Weightings
The assessment process is based on the application of criteria to consider the opportunities and risks deriving from the economic, environmental and social dimensions for each company. Criteria are identified for each dimension and for all industries. Some criteria are defined as general to all industries while others are industry specific criteria as shown in Table 2-3. The table showed that the OJSI places more weight on economic features than either social or environmental features.

2.9.3 Corporate Sustainability Score
Based on the four sources of information discussed above, a sustainability performance score is calculated for each company. A company's total corporate sustainability score is calculated by SAM based on a pre-defined scoring and weighting structure. Each question has a

predetermined weight for the answer, the question, and for the theme and class within the question. The total score for the question is the combination of these weights. For example, assume that a question got an answer "A" with a score "25", the predetermined question weight is "0.05", and the criterion weight is "0.042". Therefore, the score for that question would be calculated as [25

TS = ~ (ANS

15

where, TS is the Total Score; ANS is the Answer Score; QUW is the Question Weight; and CRW is the Criterion Weight. Based on the score given to the companies, the selection of the top 20% from the 600 biggest companies from Canada and U.S. in the field of sustainability is then done. Although it seems that the score depends only on the questionnaire, all other sources of information provide information to fill in the questionnaire. 2.9.4 Corporate Sustainability Monitoring Process Corporate sustainability monitoring is a part of the ongoing review process. Once a company is selected as a member in the DJSI, it is continuously monitored for its corporate sustainability performance and management for any critical issues that may arise for environmental, economic, and social issues. Moreover, corporate sustainability monitoring might exclude any company from the index despite its performance during the assessment review. The monitoring process depends on media reviews as well as the analysis of stakeholder information. Some of the critical issues reviewed include: commercial practices such as tax and balance sheet fraud. human rights abuses such as cases involving child labour and discrimination, layotTs or \vorkforce conflicts such as strikes, and catastrophic events or accidents such as workplace safety issues and ecological disasters (DJSI, 20 I 0). 2.9.5 Impact Evaluation If a critical issue has been identified during the monitoring process, the first step is to evaluate the degree of this issue within the company. If the effect of the crisis on the status of the company and its core business is extensive or is an important concern for the company, the monitoring moves to the next step. In a second step, SAM analysts should verify the quality of a company's crisis management and assess how well the company informs the public, acknowledges responsibility, involves relevant stakeholders and develops solutions. If the crisis management is considered poor from a sustainability point of view, the DJSI design committee can decide to exclude the company from the DJSINA (DJSI, 2010). To ensure the quality and objectivity of the corporate sustainability assessment, an external reviewer monitors and maintains the accuracy of the assessment procedures and results. The key advantages and

disadvantages of the SAM methodology can be summarized as shown in Table 2-4.

2.10 Summary Several researchers claim that the DJSI is one of the world's best sustainability indices and that SAM has the best in practice assessment process (Lee 2006; Beleo et al. 2004). However, currently there is no academic research that addresses how the DJSI is actually used, the steps taken by companies to achieve acceptance to the index, or to maintain their inclusion in the DJSI (Fowler and Hope, 2007). Inclusion in the DJSI puts pressure on the selected firms since they must make continued progress to keep their status. The long-term challenge is to extend

measurement systems to include the sustainability of business activities, through impact measures, and the competitive advantage they are creating, through customer and financial measures (Carleton, 2009; Lopez at aI., 2007). Fowler and Hope (2007) presented a number of additional critiques of the SAM assessment methodology: Â· For a company to be included in the DJSI, it must be one of the largest 2,500 companies, by free-market float capitalization in the DJGTSM.

17

Â·

The aim is to include only industry leading companies which are able to devote to the issues raised in the questionnaire, which considered as a bias to the market.

Â·

Selected companies might not necessarily represent "sustainability" if a more balanced view were taken of the economic, environmental, and social components defined in the index.

Artiach et al. (2010) presented a case study by comparing a group of high-ranking CSP firms in the OJSI World with non-OJSI firms and they found that OJSI firms are significantly different in size, profitability, and level of growth options. They related this to the investment in CSP and argued that investment in corporate sustainability programs help to maintain the firm's competitive position among other firms in the same industry. Another useful study was conducted by Lopez et al. (2007). They compared some OJSI firms with other firms on the OJGTSM to examine the effect of applying sustainability practices on the companies' performance and value creation. They found that there were significant differences between the two samples; for example, profitability measures obtained by OJSI firms with respect to the OJGTSM firms. Furthermore, there was an economic disadvantage, in the short term, to the OJ SI firms with respect to the non-OJSI firms. Therefore, the management of those corporations should look past these short-term effects in order to lead the corporations forward. With the above in mind, this project focuses on studying the use of the OJSI in North American corporations. There were several reasons for focusing on the OJSI, including its widespread use, its recognized best-in-class methodology, the fact that it is based on economic, environmental, and social criteria, and its publicly available data, among others. The research questions, methodology, and results follow in the subsequent sections.

3. Research Questions
This research aims to explore how corporate sustainability indices are used in corporations through a case study on the DJSI. The core question of this research and its associated sub questions are listed below.

3.1

Core Question
How is the Dow Jones Sustainability Index used in North American corporations?

3.2

Sub Questions
The sub-questions were designed to help address the core question. They include: Â· How is the use of the DJSINA explained in the sustainability reports or on the websites of the Canadian and the U.S. corporations listed in the index? Â· Â· Â· How does the use of the DJS1 differ by country? What are the steps taken by corporations to achieve acceptance to the DJSI? How do selected corporations maintain their inclusion in the DJSI?

4.1

The DJSI \Vebsite Analysis
A thorough review of the DJSI website (http://www.sustainability-index.com/) was

conducted. The purposes of the analysis of the DJSI website were: Â· First, to identify companies that have been listed in the DJSINA since its inception in 2005. Â· Second, to address the following issues: - What is the rationale for the establishment of a special index for U.S. companies, while there is no special index for Canadian companies? - What is the rationale and underlying methodologies for the special indices focused on excluding companies that generate their revenues from alcohol, tobacco, adult entertainment, and armaments? - What is the meaning and the necessity for requiring a DJSI licence in case of any commercial use, such as a benchmark or as the bases for financial products? What are the potential penalties that could be applied on a company for an unauthorized use of the DJSI? What is the origin of the criteria and weightings for each of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions and on what basis they have been developed? - On what basis is the methodology of the DJSI North America selecting leading companies? What is the percentage for the accuracy and transparency of selecting those companies? Answering these questions helped provide context for the rest of the study.

4.1.1 Data Analysis
To accomplish the first purpose of the DJSI website analysis, all of the DJSINA lists since its inception were explored in order to identify those corporations that have been listed in the index since 2005 (up to May 31, 2010). To address the second purpose, the site was reviewed and a personal contact was initiated with a representative from the SAM group via e-mail.Al1of the results are presented and analyzed in Section 5.

4.2

Content Analysis of Corporate Sustainability Reports
The aim of the content analysis was to explore how corporate sustainability indices are used

in corporations. The DJSINA was used as the research case study. As of May 31, 20 I 0, (the date of the last available list at the time of the review), there were 140 companies listed in the DJSINA. Out of this number, there were 116 U.S. companies and 24 Canadian companies. Only 23 of the Canadian and 98 of the U.S. companies published a sustainability report at the time of the analysis. All available reports were downloaded from the companies' websites, saved, and the web link and the date of the downloaded reports was recorded. Then, each report was reviewed in order to identify any references to the DJSI. References to other sustainability indices, such as the Jantzi Social Index, FTSE4Good Index, and FTSE KLD 400 / Domini 400 Social Index were also recorded. Other key elements searched for in the content analysis were references to the SRI and the GR!.

4.2.1 Data Collection Procedures
Content analysis has many definitions in the literature. One of the broad definitions proposed by Holsti (1969) is "any technique for making inferences by objectively and systematically identifying specified characteristics of messages." Content analysis allows researchers to analyze a massive amount of data easily and to develop valid conclusions in a systematic manner (Stemler, 2001). Krippendorf (2004) noted that the content analysis technique can be a powerful tool if it is used properly to solve problems or answer research questions. In this project, content analysis was used to demonstrate answers for some of the research questions noted in Chapter 3. Sustainability reports published by the DJSINA corporations provided a basis for the content analysis. The content analysis was used in this research to examine patterns and themes in the sustainability reports. Krippendorff (1980) identified six questions which became a basis for conducting any content analysis. These are identified in Table 4-1. In this project, the first objective was to explore how the use of the DJSI is explained in corporations. To address this, the reports were analyzed to determine how the DJSI is being reported. The report was searched manually for any appearance or reference to the index or its logo. If the DJSI or its logo was highlighted in charts, tables, framed, in bold characters, in the introduction, or in the CEO's message, it was recorded. References to other sustainability

indices were also searched to examine the difference between the DJSI and other sustainability indices in terms of their appearance in the reports or on the websites. The second objective was to explore how the use ofthe DJSI in North American corporations differs by country. This would be deducted later from the analysis.

Table 4-1: The six questions provided by Krippendorff (1980) for conducting any content analysis and their applications in this project
Krippendorff's Questions How the questions apply to this Pro.iect In this study, the data to be analyzed were gathered from sustainability reports, or equivalent, published by the corporations listed in the DJSINA in recent years. The term "or equivalent" refers to other corporate reports commonly associated with sustainability such as CSR, corporate responsibility, public accountability, environmental reports, or citizenship reports, among others. Particular focus on reports published between 2007 and 2010. Other data were also gathered from the websites of the corporations. As aforementioned, sustainability reports are publicly available on the internet. They consist of the publication of qualitative and quantitative information on how a company has improved its social, economic, and environmental components over the reporting period (Daub, 2007). The population from which the data were drawn is the North American corporations listed in the DJSINA as of May 31, 2010 (DJSI, 2010). The reports selected for analysis were the most recent one for each corporation. As explained before, the context relative to this analysis is to explore how the DJSI is used in North American corporations. This analysis was essentially bounded by a regional criterion: only the DJSI North America was studied which included 140 corporations. The target of the inferences was to extract some results from the content analysis. The results would provide reasonable answers to the research questions and help in drawing valid conclusions.

4.2.2 Sample
As of May 31, 2010 a total of23 Canadian and 98 U.S. companies published a sustainability report at the time of the analysis. In all cases, the most recent report was used in the analysis. Four U.S. sustainability reports were identified for 2007, nine Canadian and 30 U.S. reports for 2008, 14 Canadian and 52 U.S. reports for 2009, and 12 U.S. reports for 2010. In cases where companies did not develop a sustainability report, the corporation's website was still reviewed for reference to the DJSI. The complete Canadian and U.S. lists are available in Table 4-2 and 43, respectively and identified by industry sector. These 140 corporations formed the sample for the study.

4.2.3 Data Analysis
Once the sample of the study had been established, a pilot test was conducted in order to determine the most appropriate way to address the research questions. The pilot test included five corporations and their initial analysis as a starting point. After that, data were gathered from two different sources: the companies' annual corporate sustainability reports and the companies' websites. A content analysis of all 140 corporate reports and websites was conducted in order to address the research questions. A worksheet was developed to facilitate the analysis. The

worksheet recorded the results for each corporation (by row) and the key words that had been searched manually (by column). Tables containing the key references and quotes pertaining to the DJSI were also developed. Appendix A and B. In the pilot test, it was found that companies use different terminology in their sustainability reports and on their websites. Therefore, a number of terms were used to identify the research keywords: "DJSI", "Dow Jones Sustainability Index", "Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America", "Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index", "Jantzi Social Index", "FTSE4Good Index", "Domini 400 Social Index", "Socially Responsible Investment", "SRI", "Socially Responsible", "Social Investment", "Responsible Investment", "Global Reporting Initiatives", and "GRI". The first three columns of the worksheet recorded the company's name, country, and sector respectively. The fourth and fifth columns recorded the year that the report was published and the number of pages in the report. The sixth column represented the year of initial inclusion in the DJSINA for each company. The data in this column was verified based on a review of the DJSI website. The seventh column noted if there was any reference to the DJSI in the report or on the company's website or both. Column number eight highlighted if the company under review used the DJSI Logo. The next three columns represented other indices the company under review might be listed. Column number twelve represented if a company considered the SRI in their performance. The last column recorded if the company used the GRI as guidelines for reporting on its sustainability performance. For a "YES" answer, the green colour represents data collected from the report, the blue colour represents data collected from the website of the company and the orange colour represents data collected from both, the report and the website. The "NO" answers mean that there is no information available either in the The complete set of tables and worksheets are available in

report or on the website of the identified company. The worksheets are available in Appendix A and B. A detailed analysis is presented in Section 5.

4.3

The Survey

A survey was conducted to obtain perspectives from corporate experts and to explore gaps in the literature regarding the use of sustainability indices in the Canadian corporations. The survey provided an indication of how important it is for a company to be included in the existing sustainability indices, such as DJSfNA. The survey answered research questions three and four as shown in Figure 4-1.

4.3.1 Survey Procedure
The results of the literature review helped in developing the survey questions. The survey consisted of nine questions. The questions are summarized in Table 4-4. Since the research involved humans, the questions were approved by the Research Ethics Board (REB) at Ryerson University. FluidSurveys software (http://fluidsurveys.com) was used to set up the questionnaire and to obtain the data from the participants. The survey was available at the following link: http://fluidsurveys.com/surveys/d-m-tldow-jones-sustainability-indexl. The survey was

completely voluntary and participants could choose not to answer any particular question. Noting that, the questions were intended to be open-ended because this is an exploratory research and the aim was not to give preconceived notations.

Table 4-4: The nine questions of the online survey
No. I Survey Questions What is the name of your comQany? What is your role within the comQany? What is the number of employees inyour company? What is the primary motivation for sustainability or corporate responsibility initiatives in your company? What benefits, if any, does your company see from being listed in the Dow Jolles Sustainabili~ Index? What steps, if any, did your compan~ initiall~ take to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainabilit~ Index? What steps, if any, has your com~any taken to remain included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index? What suggestions, ifany, do you have for improving the Dow Jones Sustainability Index? What areas do you see for future work in corporate sustainability measurement and assessment? What key challenges do you anticipate in these areas?

One of the most challenging issues in conducting the research survey is to find the contact information for the Director of Sustainability or "equivalent person". Equivalent person refers to

28

the Director of Corporate Social Responsibility, the Director of the Environmental Sustainability, or others. When the contact information of that person was available, the invitation letter

including the survey link, the project information, and the informed consent form was sent to himlher via electronic mail. BCE was excluded since it was removed from the DJSI prior to issuing the invitations to participate. A reminder to complete the survey was sent after two weeks from the date of the first invitation letter. 4.3.2 Sample

A total of 10 Canadian corporations participated in the research survey. This represented
a response rate of 41.7%. These ten corporations represented four different sectors:

financials, basic materials, industrials, and oil and gas. Further details on the sample are available in section 5. 4.3.3 Data Analysis The results of the survey were presented in aggregate form, meaning that no comments were . attributed to a specific individual or a company. A complete record of all answers received to the questions is available in Append1x C. The key results are summarized and analyzed in section 5.

5. Results and Discussion
This section presents a summary and discussion of the results gathered in the research. This section is organized around the three primary phases noted in the methodology. First, the results from the DJSI website review are analyzed. Second, the results of the content analysis are presented and discussed. Finally, the results of the survey are examined. 5.1 Results from the DJSI Website Analysis The DJSI website was explored in detail. This analysis provided original data for content analysis and a basis for identifying all the companies that have been listed in the DJSINA since its inception in 2005. It also helped identify areas that needed additional clarification. These areas were addressed through an email consultation with a SAM representative. 5.1.1 Corporations Listed in the DJSINA since 2005 Table 5-1 and 5-2 shows the 12 Canadian and the 60 U.S. corporations, respectively, that have been listed in the DJSINA since its inception in 2005 and up-to May 31, 2010.

Table 5-1 shows that 50% (12 companies) of the Canadian corporations were listed in the DJSINA since its inception in 2005. This percentage represents only three sectors: Financials, Oil and Gas, and Telecommunications with a majority to the financials sector (6 companies).

30

Table 5-2 shows that about 52% (60 companies) of the U.S. corporations were listed in the DJSINA since its inception in 2005. This percentage represents nine different sectors:

Financials, Oil and Gas, Industrials, Consumer Goods, Consumer Services, Basic Materials, Health Care, Technology, and Utilities with a large percentage in the Industrials, Consumer Goods, and Consumer Services sectors (11 companies each). About half of the corporations in the sample for both Canada and the U.S. had been listed in the DJSINA since its inception. However, the U.S. corporations represent further varieties of sectors given the much larger sample in the U.S. Table 5-2: The U.S. corporations listed in the DJSI since its inception in 2005 and their industry sectors

5.1.2 General Inquires
The five questions posed to the SAM representative are presented in Table 5-3. The

responses received are also provided. These questions were identified in order to clarify gaps in the publicly available information on the DJSI website. From Table 5-3, it can be noticed that The DJSINA was established as a response to asset managers and investors in the U.S. and Canada. The index contains the top 20% of the biggest 600 largest companies from Canada and the U.S. in terms of sustainability. This is consistent with the information available on the DJSI website. One point that was noticed during the review of the website is that there is a special DJSI for U.S. companies. However, there is no special index for the Canadian companies. Clarification on this issue was therefore sought. As Table 5-3 notes, the SAM representative indicated that there was particular demand for a U.S.focused index. The representative also clarified that indices that exclude companies that

generate their revenue from alcohol, tobacco, adult entertainment, and armaments were

32

developed. This is consistent with an overall trend in SRI investment analysis where several indices have emerged based on these exclusionary criteria. When asked about the origin of the criteria and weightings for each of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions, the representative explained that they were developed based on investigation, exploration, and deep analysis for the most updated sustainability issues for each industry sector. Few specific details were provided. Table 5-3: Results from the DJSI website analysis
Questions What is the rationale for the establishment of a special index for U.S. companies, while there is no special index for Canadian companies? Answers "We saw demand for a US-focused index from asset managers and investors both in the US and in Europe. Due to restricted time and resources, we can only create country indices when we experience particular demand. Canadian companies are included in the DJSI North America benchmarks." What is the rationale and underlying methodologies for "I believe there was a misunderstanding. We publish the special indices focused on companies that generate Indexes that exclude companies which are active in the their revenues from alcohol, tobacco, adult above mentioned sectors. The reason for the exclusions entertainment, and armaments? IS that some investors follow very strict ethical guidelines which determine in which kind of companies they are allowed to invest." What is the meaning and the necessity for requiring a "The licensee is needed to use the intellectual property DJSl licence in case of any commercial use, such as a involved with the DJSI for any financial products. benchmark or as the bases for financial products? What License holders receive daily, up-to-date information on are the potential penalties that could be applied on a the weightings and divisors of the index components (companies represented in the index), as well as company for an unauthorized use of the DJSl? notifications of major corporate actions (mergers, acquisitions etc.). The licensee also entitles the holder to use the DJSI brand In marketing its products. Unauthorized use of the DJS} can lead to legal actions." What is the origin of the criteria and weightings for each "At SAM-group, we have a very experienced, dedicated of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions group of analysts, who identify sustainability themes for each industry sector. The analysts gather research and and on what basis they have been developed? adapt our industry specific questionnaires to the most recent sustainability issues, as well as, identifying novel areas of concern for their industries." On what basis is the methodology of the DJSl North "The DJSI North America contains the top performing America selecting leading companies? What is the 20% of the 600 largest companies from Canada and the percentage for the accuracy and transparency of US in terms of sustainability." selecting those companies?

5.2 Results from the Reports Content Analysis

In this sub-section, the results of the content analysis of the sustainability reports are presented. The reports are first analyzed by country. For both Canada and the U.S., the

discussions are organized into nine sections, including: a summary of the industry sectors represented in the study, the names of the reports sampled, the average length of the reports, the year of initial inclusion in the DJSINA for the corporations in the sample, the use of the DJSI logo, data gathered on the use of other sustainability indices, a summary of material gathered on SRI, and the use of the ORI guidelines. Examples of the use of the DJSI in both Canadian and American corporations are then presented and discussed. Finally, the sub-section ends with a comparison of reporting on the DJSI in Canadian and U.S. corporations. 5.2.1 The Canadian Reports Analysis 5.2.1.1 Industry Sectors The 24 Canadian corporations included in the DJSINA are categorized by sector as shown in Table 5-4 and Figure 5-1. Six different industries were included in the DJSINA. The financial and oil and gas sectors represent the majority of companies included in the DJSINA. Basic materials companies are also well represented. Telecommunication, industrials, and utilities companies also had representation on the list. .

The focus of the content analysis was on sustainability reports or their equivalent. Therefore, the research sample's reports were categorized by name in order to provide a detailed picture on the variety of reports analyzed in this study. The 23 Canadian corporate sustainability reports are categorized by name as shown in Table 5-5. As previously noted, one company had not

published a sustain ability report at the time of the report review. It should be noted that for simplicity, reports entitled "corporate sustainability", "summary on sustainability", or "online sustainability report" were all classified under the title of "sustainability report". The full breakdown of these report names is available in Appendix A. Table 5-5 shows that half of the studied reports were called either, "sustainability reports" or "responsibility reports". The other common name was "corporate social responsibility report". The fact that 7 different names were used for only 23 corporations highlights the lack of standardization in sustainabi1ity reporting.

From Table 5-6, a wide range of report lengths is apparent. For instance, the shortest report was 16 pages (Encana Corporation). This report highlighted only a few issues, which included people, safety, environment, engagement, and community investment. The longest report was CIBC's (197 pages), which provided information about financial, environmental, social, management, and shareholder issues. There were four reports longer than 100 pages, including two corporate social responsibility reports (Bombardier Inc., 106 pages and Enbridge Inc., 171

36

pages), one annual accountability report (CIBC, 197 pages), and one sustainability report (Potash Corp., 181 pages). The wide variation in the length further underscores the lack of common agreement of what should be included in sustainability reports and how that material should be addressed.

5.2.1.4 Year ofinciusion in the DJSINA
As illustrated in Table 5-7, 50% (12 companies) of the Canadian companies included in the sample had been listed in the DJSINA since its inception in 2005. Three corporations were added in 2009. All other corporations had been listed since at least 2008. A summary of each corporation's initial inclusion in the DJISNA is provided in Appendix A.

5.2.1.5 References to the DJSI
About 83% (20 companies) have references to the DJSI in their reports or on their websites. Of the 24 companies, 54.2% (13 companies) refer to the DJSI in both their sustainability reports and their websites, 16.7% (4 companies) refer to the DJSI in their sustainability reports only, and 12.5% (3 companies) refer to the Index on their websites only. About 16.7% (4 companies) have no references to the DJSI at aIL Seven companies contain formal and signed statements from the CEOs in their sustainability reports that make reference to the DJSl. As a representative

example, Encana Corporation's corporate responsibility report contains a formal, signed statement from the President and CEO who said "In addition to being listed on the DJSI for the second year in a row, we have been awarded a SAM award for demonstrating leadership in sustainability. We are the only North American company under the 'Oil & Gas Producers' category to be recognized with a class distinction in the SustainabiJity Yearbook 2009." A complete summary of the comments on the DJSl from the CEOs is provided in Appendix A.

5.2.1.7 Other Sustainability Indices
About 54% (13 companies) had references to the JSI and 37.5% (9 companies) had references to the FTSE4Good Index. Inclusion in one or more of these sustainability indices is beneficial for any company because in this way the company is recognized by investors and other stakeholders. As an illustrative example, the President and CEO of Encana Corporation said, "Once again, our sustainable approach to resource development has been recognized by the World DJSI Index and the JSI. I invite you to visit our website regularly to learn more about EnCana and how each day we strive to provide energy for people, responsibly." Also, it was on Bank of Montreal's website that, "BMO Financial Group was selected for inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index. FTSE indices are used extensively by a range of investors such as

consultants, asset owners, fund managers, investment banks, stock exchanges and brokers." A complete summary of the comments on the JSI and the FTSE4Good Index is available in Appendix A.

5.2.1.8 Socially Responsible Investment - SRI
About 71% (17 companies) of the Canadian companies commented on SRI in their sustainability reports or on their websites. This underscores the attention these companies are paying to this important issue. As a representative example, the President and CEO of BMO Financial Group stated on the website, "We are very proud to have been recognized among the most socially responsible corporations in Canada". He also said "Operating our business

ethically and according to the principles of honesty, transparency and accountability are central to who we are and what we stand for. We also understand that we can't belong to a community - share in its resources, enjoy its benefits without giving back." As another example, Nexen Inc. stated in its report that "the oil sands industry is attracting attention from investors who want to know how companies are addressing related social and environmental impacts." A complete summary ofthe comments on SRI is available in Appendix A.

39

5.2.1.9 Global Reporting Initiative - GRI A total of 83% (20 companies) used the GRI framework to report on their sustainability performance. The literature highlighted that the GRI framework is intended to serve as a

generally accepted framework for reporting on an organization's economic, environmental, and social performance. As an illustrative example, Barrick Gold Corp.'s responsibility report

declared that, "Barrick has chosen to report according to the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines for the past six years, using G3, the third version of the guidelines for the past three years. The annual Responsibility Reports based on the GRI framework, can be used by us and by our stakeholders to benchmark our performance against others in our industry." A complete list of companies using the GRI is available in Appendix A. The 20 companies are classified by scctor and presented in Table 5-8. The table shows that the financial sector has the highest rate of usage of the GRI in the Canadian corporations studied.

5.2.2 The U.S. Reports Analysis 5.2.2.1 Industry Sectors As shown in Table 5-9 and Figure 5-4, the 116 U.S. corporations included in the DJSINA are categorized by sector. Ten different industry sectors are included in the DJSINA. The consumer services sector has the highest number of companies included in the DJSINA. The industrials sector comes in the second place and consumer goods, financials, and health care sectors come in the third place. This is an indication to the wide varieties of services that U.S. corporations have. A number of other sectors were also well represented in the sample.

Therefore, only 98 sustainability reports have been reviewed and categorized by name as shown in Table 5-10. It is worth noting that for simplicity, "sustainability highlights", "sustainability summary", "sustainability performance report", "sustainability priorities report", "sustainability review", "sustainability progress report", "blueprint for sustainability", "business and sustainability report", "sustainability overview", and "corporate sustainability report" were all classified under one name which is "sustainability report". A complete list of all report names listed by company is available in Appendix B. Table 5-10 shows that a majority (58%) of the studied reports are called either "sustainability reports" or "responsibility reports". Other names included, "corporate or global social responsibility

5.2.2.3 Average Length of Report The mean and median values of length for each type of report were calculated. A summary is provided in Table 5-11, including the minimum and maximum lengths.

42

-

Table 5-11 shows a wide range of report lengths is recognized. For example, the shortest report in the U.S. sample was Allstate Corporation's 2008 responsibility summary (3 pages). This report provided a brief summary of social responsibility at Allstate Corporation. The

longest report was Newmont Mining Corporation's sustainability report (322 pages). The report was very comprehensive and provided details about almost everything in the company.
It

included information about financial, environmental, social, management, community, health and safety, shareholder issues, and others. There were ten reports longer than 100 pages.

Among them there were five corporate social responsibility reports (Campbell Soup Co. 122 pages; Cisco systems inc., 237 pages; Gap Inc., 161 pages; General Mills Inc., 102 pages; and H.J. Heinz Co., I 08 pages). Of the other five, four were sustainability reports (Autodesk Inc., 105 pages; Cummins Inc., 106 pages; Newmont Mining Corp., 322 pages; and United Parcel Service Inc., 106 pages) and the last one was a corporate responsibility report (Nike Inc., 176 pages). Overall, there was no common length of a sustainability report for the U.S. corporations in the sample. Again, this serves to underscore the many different interpretations of what should be in a sustainability report and how it should be reported.

5.2.2.4 Year of Inclusion in the DJSINA
As can be seen from Table 5-12, about 52% (60 companies) of all 116 U.S. companies in the sample were listed in the DJSI since its inception in 2005. Many companies were also recently

43

added to the DJSINA, with 27 joining the list in 2009. A complete summary of when each corporation was first listed in the DJSINA is available in Appendix B. Table 5-12: Year of inclusion in the DJSINA and the number of the U.S. corporations

5.2.2.5 References to the DJSI Figure 5-5 shows that about 71 % (82 companies) of the reports contained references to the DJS!. 45% (52 companies) referred to the DJSI in both their sustainability reports and on their websites, 11% (13 companies) referred to the DJSI in their sustainability reports only, and 15% (17 companies) referred to the Index on their websites only. 25% (29 companies) contained formal, signed statements from their CEOs in their sustainability reports that made reference to the DJSI. For example, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola Company said "In 2009, we were included in the DJSI World and DJSINA. Our continued inclusion reflects our leadership in setting standards in sustainable growth and in achieving exceptional environmental, social, and economic performance." As another example, the Chief Administrative Officer for AMD said "inclusion in the DJSINA underscores our commitment to operating with integrity, responsibility and the utmost respect for people and the environment". The Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety at Con Edison said "Listing on the DJSI is an important benchmark for us." He also stated that "Our corporate commitment on environmental, health, safety, and sustainability issues is a definitive part of our company and all its operations. The 14,000 people who work together at Con Edison understand how integral that commitment is to everything we do." Other examples are available in Appendix B. Additional discussion on the use of the DJSI in corporations is available in Section 5.1.3.

5.2.2.7 Other Sustain ability Indices
About 24% (28 companies) and 11% (13 companies) of the 116 companies had references to the FTSE4Good Index and the Domini 400 social index, respectively. These indices assure the leadership of these corporations in the sustainability field. As declared by the CEO of Becton Dickinson & Co. in their report, "As we pursue our purpose of 'Helping all people live healthy lives,' we strongly believe in balancing the 'triple bottom line,' achieving strong economic performance, promoting environmental stewardship and advancing social responsibility. I am pleased that our efforts are gaining prestigious recognition such as our continued inclusion in the FTSE4Good index." It was stated in Johnson Controls lnco's report that, "Our sustainability performance is recognized by numerous respected corporate social responsibility and sustainability investment indices such as Domini 400 Social Index." A complete summary of the comments on the FTSE4Good Index and the Domini 400 Social Index is available in Appendix B.

5.2.2.8 Socially Responsible Investment - SRI
About 44% (52 companies) of the U.S. corporations in the sample mentioned their socially responsible investment efforts and recognitions in their reports or websites. For example, Abbott Laboratories Corporation was named one of the top three 2010 Best in Class companies in its industry sector by Store brand Investments, a leading SRI firm. As another example, in late 2009, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) team conducted a study to understand the perspectives and expectations of their customers, peer companies, and SRI advisors. The study focused on the perceptions and expectations of their corporate responsibility programs. The common messages were that "these stakeholders would like AMD to engage more deeply and communicate more frequently on corporate responsibility matters. Specifically, several

stakeholders would like our corporate responsibility efforts to be more entrenched in our business practices and our customer relationships. The data from this study and other inputs are currently being utilized to evaluate possible changes to our corporate responsibility strategy." Additional examples are available in Appendix B.

46

5.2.2.9 Global Reporting Initiative - GRI
About 57% (67 companies) of the 116 U.S. companies in the sample used the GRI framework to report on their sustainability performance. As an illustrative example, Applied Materials

Inc.' s 2009 citizenship report included the following statement, "This report follows the Reporting Framework and Sustainability Reporting Guidelines set forth by the GRt It includes descriptions, historic data and perspectives on the company's significant economic, environmental, and social impacts and contributions for fiscal year 2009." Additional examples are available in Appendix B. The 67 companies are classified by sector and presented in Table 5-10. The table shows that the technology and consumer goods sectors were the only sectors with more than 10 corporations applying the GR! guidelines. The utilities, health care, and industrials sectors also had a relatively high number of corporations applying the GRI guidelines.

5.2.3 The use of the DJSI in the Canadian and the U.S. Corporations Listed in the DJSINA
From the content analysis, it can be demonstrated that 79% of the Canadian corporations (19 companies) and about 52% of the U.S. corporations (60 companies) have significant statements related to the actual use of the DJSI in corporations. These statements are available in Appendix A and B. Six different uses of the DJSI were extracted from the content analysis and discussed below.

5.2.3.1 Benchmarking
The DJSI was used by some corporations as a benchmark. corporations had statements related to this. Four Canadian and 10 U.S.

However, relatively little detail on how the

47

corporations used the DJS[ in this way was provided in the reports. Most corporations that noted its use in benchmarking were relatively brief. An illustrative example is given by Bank of Nova Scotia, "The DJSINA comprises the top companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria for the North American region and provides a benchmark for sustainability-driven North American equity portfolios." The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce described the DJSI as "an influential benchmark for socially responsible asset managers." As a third example, the United Health Group Inc. announced that "The DJSI recognizes and benchmarks companies that set industry-wide best practices in corporate sustainability" A complete list of corporations mentioning the use of the DJSI as a benchmark is available in Table 5-14. A complete list of the relevant statements is available in Appendix A and B. Table 5-14: Corporations with significant statements related to the use of the DJSI in benchmarking
Canadian Corporations Bank of Nova Scotia, Barrick Gold Corp., BCE Inc., and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce U.S. Corporations Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Autodesk Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Conso 1idated Edison Inc., PG&E Corp., ProLogis, United Parcel Service Inc., United Technologies Corp., and UnitedHealth Group Inc.

5.2.3.2 Investment Decision-Making Although the DJSI is frequently used as a guide in selecting sustainability leaders for asset managers and socially responsible investors, only five Canadian and five U.S. corporations explicitly recognized this in their reports. As Barrick Gold Corp. mentioned, "the DJSI is

considered influential in investment-decision making, particularly for socially responsible investors." Moreover, as Alcoa Inc. noted, the "DJSI is an important guide for investors to assess a company's non-financial performance." ThIS statement indicates that the DJSI is not only a measure for the financial performance but also for other non-financial activities. Table 5-15 presents the corporations with statements related to the use of the DJSI in investment decisionmaking. A complete summary of the statements is available in Appendix A and B.

5.2.3.3 Business Ranking
Corporations increasingly need to know how they rate against their peers in order to compete. A limited number of corporations in the sample noted the role of the DJSI in facilitating this process. For example, Enbridge Inc. explained the role of the DJSI in this way as, "The DJSl provides business rankings based on information about organizations' social, ethical and environmental policies and practices." As a second example, Abbott Labs noted that "The DJSI World ranks Abbott among the t0P 10 percent of the world's leading 2,500 companies, based on an assessment of economic, social and environmental performance." Table 5-16 illustrates the five corporations with statements related to the use of the DJSI in business ranking. A complete summary of the relevant statements is available in Appendix A and B.

Table 5-16: Corporations with significant statements related to the use of the DJSI in business ranking
Canadian Corporations Enbridge Inc., National Bank of Canada, and TELUS Corp. U.S. Corporations Abbott Labs. and Kimberly-Clark Corp.

5.2.3.4 Risk Management
The DJSI was used by some of the corporations in the sample to help explain how the corporation managed its environmental, social, and economic risks. It was also used to help identify areas for future work and for improvement. As declared by Nexen Inc., "The DJSI is used in managing environmental, social and governance risk and assesses how well publicly traded companies are doing this." Another illustrative example is provided by Encana Corp., "The DJSI is used in management, stakeholder relations and corporate governance." Entergy Corp. claimed that "The annual review of the DJSI is based on a comprehensive analysis of corporate economic, environmental and social performance that assesses issues such as corporate

49

'nP

governance, risk management, climate change mitigation, supply chain standards and labour practices." Table 5-17 illustrates corporations with statements related to the use of the DJSI in risk management. Appendix A and B contains a complete summary of the relevant statements from the reports or websites.

5.2.3.5 Measuring Sustainability Performance
A number of corporations noted that the DJSI is used to measure, evaluate, and improve sustainability performance in environmental, social, and economic fields. For example,

Bombardier Inc. noted that "The DJSI tracks the financial performance of companies who are leaders in business sustainability. It also evaluates companies' long-term economic,

environmental, and social performance." Table 5-18 shows corporations with statements related to the use of the DJSI in measuring sustainability performance. A complete summary of the relevant statements is available in Appendix A and B.

Canadian Corporations BCE Inc., Bombardier Inc. CI B SV, National Bank of Canada, and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. U.S. Corporations Spectra Energy Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc.

5.2.3.6 Highlighting Sustainability Achievements
Several corporations noted that the DJSI helped provide it with recognition of achievement. For example, Bell Canada Enterprises announced that "BCE has been named to the DJSINA". BCE is one of only eighteen Canadian companies to be recognized for excellence in corporate sustainability. Also, Encana's CEO declared "In addition to being listed on the DJSI for the second year in a row, we have been awarded a SAM award for demonstrating leadership in

50

sustainability,

We are the only North American company under the 'Oil & Gas Producers'

category to be recognized with a class distinction in the Sustainability Yearbook 2009." As another example, the Chairman of the Board and CEO of JC Penny said, "We were glad to see our efforts recognized by our inclusion in the DJSINA and among the top four retailers Newsweek's Greenest Big Companies in America.
In

To reaffirm our commitment to

environmental responsibilities, JC Penney has set a goal to reduce facility energy use by 20% per gross square foot by 2015", Moreover, Johnson & Johnson Corporation announced on its

website that inclusion in the DJSI is an environmental award. Furthermore, Life Technologies CEO noted that "We're proud to again be recognized for our achievements in conservation and global citizenship." A summary of the companies using the DJSI to highlight sustainability achievement is provided in Table 5-19. A complete summary of the relevant statements available in Appendix A and B.

5.2.4 A Comparison between the Canadian and the U.S. Corporations
A comparison between the Canadian and the U.S. corporations was conducted. The key points are summarized in Table 5-20. Both countries were fairly similar overall, but there were several substantial differences. For instance, a broader range of sectors was included in the sample of U.S. corporations. This was not necessarily a surprise given the much larger sample.

51

In both countries, there was no standard use for report names or standard lengths of reports. As previously noted, this highlights the lack of standardization of sustainability reporting. About half of the corporations in the sample for both Canada and the U.S. had been listed in the DJSINA since its inception. Moreover~ most corporations in both countries made reference to the DJSI in their reports or websites with a slightly greater percentage in the Canadian corporations. Less than half of the corporations in both countries used the DJSJ logo. The JSI is a Canadian index and the Domini 400 Social Index is a U.S. index. About half of the Canadian corporations referred to the JSI in their reports or websites. However, only I I % of American corporations referred to the Domini 400 Social Index. It is also apparent that more Canadian companies made reference to SRI and the GRI. Finally, there were a higher proportion of

Canadian companies that explained how they used the DJSL Table 5-20: A comparison between the Canadian and the U.S. corporations

Results from the Survey Analysis

The aim of the survey was to obtain perspectives from corporate experts and to explore gaps in the literature regarding the use of the DJSI in the Canadian corporations. As shown earlier in Table 4~4, the survey contained nine questions. There were three general questions about the name of the company, the role of the participant. and how many employees the company had. The other six questions were related to corporate sustainability and the DJSL A summary of the

52

results obtained by question is provided below and sorted by sector. A complete record of all comments received in the survey is provided in Appendix C.

I

5.3.1 Industry Sectors Participated in the Survey
Experts from 10 Canadian corporations participated in the survey. A summary of the

participants by industry sector is presented in Table 5-21. Requests were sent to experts in all of the corporations listed in the sample, with the exception of BCE. Eight corporations did not respond to the request to participate. Of the remaining corporations in the sample, four financial corporations declined to participate either due to the volume of similar requests or because they did not wish to publicly disclose any additional information. One oil and gas corporation also said that they do not participate in any research survey. All other Canadian corporations in the sample participated in the survey.

5.3.2 The Role of the Participated Persons
The participants in the survey had a wide variety of specific titles. However, all of the

participants played a role in the corporation's sustainability initiatives and had direct knowledge of its activities related to the DJSL A complete summary of the titles of the participants is provided in Table 5-22.

53

5.3.3 Number of Employees within the Participating Companies
All participated companies were quite large. Given the scope of the DJSINA, this was not surprising. The range of employees was from just over 3,000 to well over 50,000.

5.3.4 Sustainability Motivation
In this question, participants were asked to comment on their corporation's motivation for sustainabiJity or corporate responsibility initiatives in their companies. Table 5~23 summarizes the key responses received by sector. Table 5-23 shows that the participants believe that sustainability initiatives help strengthen the relationships between the company and its stakeholders (social benefit), help minimize emissions and protect the environment (environmental benefit), and positively affect their business from a financial perspective (economic benefit). These motivations are consistent with what has been cited in the literature.

5.3.5 Benefits from Being Listed in the DJSI
In this question participants were asked about the benefits that their companies gain from being listed in the DJSL Table 5-24 summarizes the key answers received by sector. From Table
5-24~

it can be noticed that the sustainability experts agreed that being listed in
leaders~

the DJSI provides the company with high reputation among industry investors (especially those focused on
SRI)~

helps attract

and helps identify areas for future improvement.

Again, these benefits are consistent with those commonly cited in the literature on corporate sustainability.

Table 5-24: Benefits from inclusion in the DJSI
Benefits from being listed in the DJSI - Bragging rights. Attracting investors by using the DJSI Logo. - Evaluating year over year performance.

,/

Most of the answers were about how to respond to the SAM questionnaire. As Table 5-25 indicates, some of these responses included: ensuring thorough data, convening a special committee to respond, and consulting SAM analysts. As an example of one sector's response, the experts from the oil and gas sector provided a number of valuable answers. For example, one of the experts mentioned that delivering good non-financial performance in some fields like environmental-health and safety and community relations was already a key corporate priority and completing the DJSI questionnaire therefore involved no additional initiatives. Another expert from the same industry said that inclusion in the DJSI is a very resource intensive exercise, but it adds value to the company. Additional details are provided in Appendix C. 5.3.7 Steps Taken by Companies to Remain Included in the DJSI In this question participants were asked about the steps that their company took to remain included in the DJSI. Table 5-26 summarizes the key responses by industry sector. The answers from Table 5-26 highlight that remaining in the DJSI is not an easy task. The participants highlighted that the company must continually improve. For example, the financial sector's experts noted that an essential issue was to increase the number of internal stakeholders who respond to the questionnaire to assure comprehensive data availability. However, they also mentioned the need for the continuous development of their internal programs. The basic

materials' participants also expressed a need to improve the internal programs and to respond to the questionnaire seriously. The industrials sector's participant said that the company always seeks to improve the scores in some areas and identifies weaknesses to guide updates and

56

modifications. The participant also added that the company's team works with a third party firm. The oil and gas participants were more concerned about their environmental and social impacts and the strong relations with their stakeholders. They also added that inclusion in the DJSI helps the company to accomplish high performance. Moreover, reporting initiatives ensure that the company has continuous progress on its sustainability performance. A complete summary of the answers received from the experts is available in Appendix C.

Sector Steps taken by com~anies to remain included in the DJSI - Increased the number of internal stakeholders who respond to the questionnaire. - Inclusion in the DJSI is not the specific driver of the company but it serves as validation that the company is taking the right actions. - Continuing to develop programs and remain a leader among commercial real estate managers. - Improve the program. - Increased number of people who respond to the questionnaire. - The DJSI assessment is very serious so the company dedicates significant time and resources to complete the profile. - Sought to improve the score in some areas. - Contacted the DJSI to get feedback on the company's performance and identify areas of improvement. - Worked with third party firm. Good non-financial performance (ethics, fairness, EH&S, social/community relations, etc.). - Being credible and trustworthy and doing all the right things. - Sustainability reporting initiatives. - Identify weaknesses and work on them with experts. - Find the lowest score and introduce new approaches that will add value to the company without changing the process. - Improve the company's performance and DJSI helps to accomplish that.

5.3.8 Suggestions to Improve the DJSI
Concerning the suggestions that the experts might have for improving the DJSI, Table 5-27 provides a summary of the key responses received by sector. Several insights were provided by the experts. The financial sector's experts noted that the assessment process should follow the GRI guidelines. They also noted that sharing the analysis between all the listed companies would help to foster implementation of best practices. The industrials sector's participant pointed to the unfairness in the assessment process in scoring companies from the same industry on the same indicators. This comment may have been

motivated by the concern that the assessment would not take unique local circumstances into

57

account. The oil and gas sector's participants suggested that the SAM questionnaire should avoid lengthy questions and should use information available in the online sustainability/CSR report in their assessment. As above mentioned, one expert suggested merging the DJSI

requirements with the ORI and focusing on key material issues. Also, the responses indicated that the participants were willing to receive a more detailed scorecard that clearly highlights potential areas for improvement in the company. One of the participants mentioned the high cost of the preparation process. This comment echoes other comments on streamlining the

assessment process and consolidating the number of sustainability assessments currently in use.

The sustainability experts suggested several areas for the future work in corporate sustainability. assessments. requests. Several experts highlighted the need to standardize corporate sustainability This would help reduce duplication of their efforts in responding to survey

Responding to external surveys consumes a considerable amount of company

58

resources. The number of assessments also creates confusion in terms of evaluating companies on their sustainability performance. Consolidating the number of assessments would therefore help provide a clearer basis on which to make comparisons between companies. Many other specific examples were also provided. For example, one of the financial sector's participants mentioned that the GHG and water footprints need some work in terms of measurement and assessment because of some similarities in their data. sustainability measures in general. A similar comment applied to

There is a need to clarify the measures that should be

reported and the data involved in their analysis. The current lack of standards makes effective communication of sustainability initiatives a challenge. A complete summary of the responses received is provided in Appendix C.

Key Challenges
- Most sustainability requests come in the same time which needs a lot of employees, time, and efforts. - Not all the collected data is meaningful for investors. - Sustainability field is now full of designations and assessments; therefore, investors and other stakeholders have to be educated on meaning and credibility of these designations. - The biggest challenge is the lack of a framework allowing comparison between companies and industries. - Until a standard for reporting on emissions and environmental performance is established, it will remain a challenge to satisfy most observers.

6. Conclusions
6.1 Summary of Findings
The exploration of the literature revealed that a lot of work had been done on sustainability, corporate sustainability, perfonnance measurements, sustainability reporting, sustainability indicators and indices. However, there is an identified gap on the role of sustainability indices and how they are used in corporations. For that reason, this project focused on addressing the core research question 'how is the DJS1 used in North American corporations?' Several key subquestions were also designed to fill the identified gap. The research questions were addressed based on a thorough analysis of the DJSI website, an in-depth content analysis of corporate sustainability reports and websites for the 24 Canadian and 116 U.S. corporations listed in the DJSINA as of May 31, 2010, and a survey with experts from 10 Canadian corporations. A summary of the sub-questions and the key findings is provided in Table 6-1.

Some of the key findings included: - About half of the corporations in the sample for both Canada and the U.S. had been listed in the DJSINA since its inception. Most corporations in both countries made reference to the DJSI in their reports or websites with a slightly greater percentage of Canadian corporations making such references. - Less than half of the corporations in both countries used the DJSllogo. _ A higher prop_ortion of Canadian companies explained how they used the DJSI.

Table 6-1 shows that the first phase of this research methodology, i.e. the review for the DJSI website, helped identify original data for the literature and the content analysis; provide insight into the SAM assessment methodology; identify all companies listed in the index since its inception; and bring to light other areas that needed clarification. The second phase of the project was the content analysis. The content analysis provided insight into some of the roles of the DJSI in the Canadian and American corporations. These included: 1) benchmarking; 2) investment decision making; 3) business ranking; 4) risk management; 5) measuring and improving performance; and 6) highlighting sustainability achievements. Those roles were extracted from the references, the statements, and the quotes that were gathered from the reports and the websites of the 140 corporations. However,

relatively few specific details were provided by the corporations on the role of the DJSI in corporate management and internal decision-making. The comparison between the corporations based in Canada and the U.S. illustrated that there were several similarities and differences between the two countries. The third phase of the project focused on a survey with experts from the Canadian corporations. The survey was conducted to support the findings of the literature review and the content analysis as well as to answer research sub-questions three and four. The participants highlighted the role of sustainability in their corporations (for example, in supporting business success, strengthening relationship with stakeholders, and reducing the impact on the environment). They also mentioned the benefits they gained from being listed in the DJSINA

61

(for example, increased visibility, increasing number of stock holders, recognition by investors, and improving performance). The experts provided several critiques about the index and its assessment methodology (for example, lengthy questions, should follow the GRI indicators, should share analysis and publish results). The steps that are taken by corporations to achieve acceptance in the DJSI were also investigated (for example, evaluating the company's current performance, introducing new corporate sustainability initiatives, and consultation with the SAM group). The experts proposed some actions that their corporations take to maintain their
/

inclusion (for example, enhancing sustainability programs, improving the company's scores in some identified areas, and obtaining advantages from SAM feedback on the company's performance). sustainability. Overall, the project provided insight into the core research question. The project highlighted that there are several potential roles for the DJSI in North America. These include: Â· identifying the top companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria for the North American region, Â· Â· benchmarking against industry leaders, helping to meet the grO\ving market demand for professional, objective and reliable sustain ability benchmarks, Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· influencing investment decision-making and attracting investors, particularly for SRI, providing business rankings, helping manage environmental, social and governance risk, tracking the performance of leading sustainability driven companies, measuring publicly traded companies' sustainability performance, increasing the number of stock holders, improving companies' sustainability programs by identifying weak points, enhancing companies' brands, influencing companies' gro\\-th and development, and screening sustainability leaders. Finally, the participants suggested some areas for future work in corporate

Contributions
As highlighted in the literature, there is a need to study the use of corporate sustainability

indices in corporations. This research filled an identified gap in the literature on the use of the DJSI. In addition, it provided insight into the role of the DJSI in corporations. To the best of the author's knowledge, this was the first academic study that looked at this area. Thus, this project presented an original research topic in the field of sustainability that had practical implications. The analysis for the DJSI website helped identify original data for the content analysis and clarify confusing areas. The research showed that there was some information about the DJSI in the Canadian and the U.S. sustainability reports or websites. Although relatively few details were provided about its actual use, the study identified six different uses for the DJSI from the content analysis. The content analysis showed some similarities regarding the use of the DJSI in Canada and the U.S. The survey helped identify the steps that are taken by companies to be included in the DJSI and to maintain their inclusion. These were all original contributions. The project also provided general insight into sustainability reporting. As indicated by the wide variety of material observed, there is a lack of standardization in sustainability reports. This was clear by the wide variety of names, lengths of reports, inconsistent use of the GRI, and questions about what should be reporting related to the SRI.

It is anticipated that the findings of this research will find several applications in North
American corporations. The insight gained into the role of the DJSI in benchmarking,

investment decision-making, business ranking, measuring and improving performance, and highlighting sustainability achievements could help foster other corporations to improve their economic, environmental, and social performance. In addition, the clarification of benefits and challenges in gaining acceptance to the DJSINA may help encourage other corporations that are not currently listed to pursue listing in the DJSINA or other indices.

6.3

Limitations

There are some limitations to this research project. For example, the content analysis focused only on those companies listed in the DJ SIN A as of May 31, 2010. The date of the review was identified because companies included in the DJSINA are monitored continuously and the list has been updated many times since the review was started. Moreover, during this time, some

63

companies were deleted and others were added. Also, the review of the sustainability reports was done on the most recent report of a company at the time of the review. As a result, there might be a more recent report that has been published during the research study but after the review was started. It is also worth noting that corporate sustainability reports might be more marketing oriented; therefore, corporations usually select what they like to share or disclose with public. Thus, the content analysis was based on what companies in this project sample choose to provide in their reports or on websites. There are other regional DJSI indices and other specialized indices that are not included in this study. Among these indices are subsets of the DJSINA, including the Dow Jones

sustainability United States Index (DJSIUS) and the (DJSINA excluding Alcohol, Gambling, Tobacco, Armaments and Firearms) and the (DJSIUS excluding Alcohol, Gambling, Tobacco, Armaments and Firearms). The survey focused only on the Canadian corporations listed in the DJSINA and the findings from the survey were based on a relatively small sample size.

6.4

Recommendations for Further Research

There are several potential areas for further research on the DJSI and other sustainability indices. The content analysis highlighted some of the actual uses of corporate sustainability indices into corporations through the DJSI. However, the role of these indices into corporate management and internal decision-making are still not completely clear. The survey with the corporate experts provided valuable viewpoints about the steps taken by companies to be named to the DJSI and how those companies maintain their inclusion in the index.
It would be

interesting to expand the survey to the American companies and to conduct in-depth interviews to follow up on the survey findings. The results of this study provide also a baseline for in depth analysis of other sustainability indices such as the Jantzi Social Index, FTSE4Good Index, Domini 400 Social Index, or the DJSINA subset indices. There is also the possibility of

conducting a sensitivity analysis of different measurement schemes for the DJSI. This would also necessitate additional research on the construction of sustainability indices. Other suggested areas for study were also provided by the experts via the online survey. Some of the suggestions included: conducting research about 'The effect of standardization at the corporate level" particularly for issues such as sustainability reporting, sustainability indicators, and sustainability indices.
