Abstract
Anthropogenic Climate Change Coverage in Two Canadian Newspapers, the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, from 1988-2007 Katrina Marie Ahchong Master of Applied Science, 2009 Environmental Applied Science and Management Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario Canada

Media portrayal of current events can influence public perception and the actions that policy and decision makers take with regard to these events. This study applied a content

analysis to explore variations in the way Canadian news media depicted anthropogenic climate change by employing an approach previously used by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008). This. research applied their existing methodology to both the regional and national levels of media in a Canadian setting. Climate change articles from two newspapers published between 1988 and 2007, the Toronto Star, a regional newspaper, and the Globe and Mail, a national newspaper, were obtained. They were examined for aspects of climate change, including salience, image, scope, country representation, participants, and the origins of scientific information that was presented in the articles. Differences in the way climate change is portrayed between the newspapers at regional and national levels are also examined. Overall, climate change is portrayed similarly in the two newspapers as a large-scale (national and global) problem, despite the differences in audience scope. The Toronto Star exhibits a more national perspective with respect to climate change although it is a regional newspaper. Attention paid by the media to climate change increases from 1988-2007. Climate change is predominantly depicted in both newspapers as a destructive issue. There are linkages to other public issues, including those in international co-operation, science research and development, and energy and transportation. The analysis reveals that a number of non-

government and government actors are concerned with climate change and a wider array of interest groups is becoming involved. Finally, the majority of the solution strategies presented in the articles focus on mitigation techniques, as opposed to adaptation strategies.

Introduction
Rising global temperatures caused by anthropogenic sources, more commonly referred to

as global warming or climate change, is an alarming trend and a growing concern across much of the general population (IPCC, 2007b; Bedsworth, 2009; Hofmann, Butler & Tans, 2009). There are many negative implications for physical and biological systems worldwide associated with global warming. Some examples are: the increased severity of extreme weather events, the loss of Arctic and Antarctic snow and ice cover (which affects the tundra ecosystem), increased occurrences of cora) bleaching and mortality due to increases in sea surface temperatures, and greater damage to coastal regions due to flooding and storms (lPCC, 2007b). Anthropogenic climate change is a problem with the potential to affect the world both regionally and internationally. Although the affects of climate change can differ from one location to the next (see Section 2.2), it acts simultaneously as a local and global issue. Accumulating regional emissions are a major contributing factor for climate change. Therefore, all levels of governments and communities should be involved in producing solution strategies. Further, the dissemination of information across regions experiencing similar issues can speed the development of problem solving. Local governments are likely to be concerned with finding climate change solutions for their particular region. Larger governments, for example, state/provincial and national governments, are also concerned with the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change respective to their larger jurisdictions. However, efforts and funding need to be directed towards solutions that integrate both levels of government, so that more specific local and regional solutions can be attained, while keeping in mind the larger picture of what their impact will be internationally.

Media can playa crucial role in the way the public views this issue and how policies are set. To date, the majority of studies with regard to anthropogenic climate change and the news media have focused on large-scale national news media and policies; such studies will be described in further detail in Section 2 of this thesis. As well, much of the existing literature on anthropogenic climate change and the news media is largely centered on American, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australian studies, thus there is a need to view how other countries portray this issue. The aim of this study, therefore, is to identify how the problem of anthropogenic climate change is presented in regional and national newspapers in Canada. Research will compare and contrast variations in those perspectives using content analysis. Through examination of how this issue's problems and solutions are covered, insight is given into public views and policy agendas at both of these levels. The objectives of this thesis are as follows: 1. Determine the salience of climate change by examining the total number of articles and the total text count for each year. 2. Determine the quantity of Canadian, American and other international content that were in the articles. 3. Study various attributes regarding climate change as they are presented in the articles: issue image, issue scope, linkage to other issues. 4. Outline the types of climate change treatment solutions that are presented in the articles and the parties that have an invested stake in climate change. 5. Assess the level of information from scientific sources that is presented in the articles and determine what types of institutions the information comes from.

6. Compare and contrast how climate change is depicted at both the national and regional levels. 7. Discuss how the portrayal of anthropogenic climate change in the Canadian news media may affect the public and policy makers.

1.1 Overview of Thesis
This thesis will first examine the existing literature regarding climate change and the news media, before discussing the methodology, presenting the findings of the research, analyzing the results, and finally, drawing conclusions from the research. The literature review explores climate change issues, the role ofthe news media coverage in reporting and portraying various social issues, and how anthropogenic climate change has been covered by the media to date. The methodology delineates the rationale for the research, provides a brief review of the basis of content analysis, outlines the research methodology, details the procedure for data analysis, looks at the problems and limitations associated with the research, and presents a brief description of how the data was analyzed. The results of the study are then presented and discussion follows with an analysis of the findings. Finally, conclusions are drawn from the results and implications of the results and recommendations for future studies are offered.

Literature Review
Global wanning due to man-made sources is a well documented event (IPCC, 2007b;

Hofmann, Butler & Tans, 2009; Kannan & James, 2009; Seinfeld, 2008). In order to understand how this issue is portrayed by the news media, it is first important to understand the issue of climate change itself. Thus, an examination of anthropogenic climate change and its impacts is necessary.

2.1

A Brief History of Climate Change
Climate change is defined by the United Nations IntergQvernmental Panel on Climate

Change (IPCC) (2007b, p.30) as
a change in the state of a climate that can be identified (e.g., using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability 0f its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.

Anthropogenic climate change and its effects have been documented and discussed as early as the 1970s, with the realization that man-made emissions of pollutants could cause changes in the earth's climate system (Landsberg, 1970; Hoffert, 1974; Wang, Yung & Lacis, 1976; Rotty, 1979). Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) have increased since the pre-industrial era (late 18th and early 19th centuries). The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005. The concentrations of other GHGs (e.g., methane [CH4], nitrous oxide [N20), halocarbons) have also increased from preindustrial levels (IPCC, 2007b). GHGs are emitted directly to the atmosphere in many industrial processes and many GHGs also originate from electricity generation from fossil fuel sources, such as coal, oil and natural gas. They are known to have the effect of trapping energy in the

4

atmosphere and it is believed to contribute to rising temperatures around the globe (Wang. Yung
& Lacis, 1976).

As concentrations of GHGs continue to rise, more heat is trapped within the earth's atmosphere, causing its temperature to warm. According to the IPCC (2007b), the years from 1995-2006 had eleven of the twelve warmest years since temperature data has been recorded, and during the past fifty years, the occurrence and severity of some extreme weather events have increased in frequency. Currently, the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is 384 ppm and continues to rise (Tans, 2009), which could lead to further warming in the future. The following section discusses some of the consequences that have resulted and may result from the warming of the earth's climate system. Although mounting evidence suggests that humans are indeed contributing to anthropogenic climate change and that the consequences could be severe, there is an ongoing debate and uncertainty with many aspects of this issue. According to Heal and Kristrom (2002) there are three main areas of uncertainty with regard to climate change: in its impacts, in the scientific evidence and research, and in the present and future policies that will deal with this issue. The effects of anthropogenic climate change cannot be precisely predicted, and thus there is uncertainty in the rate at which its effects will be felt, and there is also the question as to whether or not the observed trends are simply a part of the natural fluctuations that are known to occur in the earth's climate (Reddy & Assenza, 2009). Debate over what actions, if any, should be taken in regard to climate change and who is responsible for those actions has been ongoing for several years (Kellogg, 1987). There have been objections to the idea of climate change raised by various industry groups, conservative political groups and politicians, and some scientists (Brown, 1996; Gelbspan, 1997; McCright and Dunlap, 2003) in what is sometimes

5

described as a backlash to this issue (Lahsen, 2008). Such groups also oppose the reliability of existing scientific evidence and operations of bodies like the IPee (Lahsen, J 999; Edwards and Schneider, 2001). Some objectors have argued that climate change will in fact be beneficial to the planet, rather than detrimental and international climate policy is wasteful and harmful to economies (Robinson and Robinson, 1997). Despite the lack of specificity of the ultimate outcome of anthropogenic climate change and those groups that argue against climate change, the mounting body of scientific evidence is undeniable. The IPee (2007a) findings suggest that anthropogenic climate change is likely (>66% probability of occurrence) to have increased the average global temperature, average global sea level, and the strength and incidence of extreme weather events. There is also generally a consensus among scientists about the origins and impacts of climate change that agree with the findings of the lPee and many support government policies and initiatives that aim to diminish this problem (Rosenberg et aI., 2009). The scientific evidence of the impacts of climate change is discussed in the following section. Action to reduce the impacts of this

problem in the form of mitigation and adaptation strategies to counter and take advantage of its possible benefits should be considered and implemented.

2.2

Impacts of Anthropogenic Climate Change
There are numerous effects of anthropogenic climate change, and many may be either

positive or negative. The warming trend and increased levels of carbon dioxide may have positive effects, in particular for agriculture. Higher levels of carbon dioxide may act to increase the rate of photosynthesis in certain plants (Wittwer, 1980), for example, wheat, barley, rice and potatoes. Elevated temperatures could increase the growing seasons in higher latitudes and possibly lead to increased crop yields (Parry, 1990). There are, however, some negative

6

repercussions for agriculture that are associated with climate change.

In some areas, it is

predicted that crop production may be further compromised in the future by global warming, particularly in areas that are already arid and have poor crop production (Wang et aI., 2009; Evans, 2009). There are many other negative effects that are associated with anthropogenic climate change. Elevated sea surface temperatures may lead to declining fish popUlations for some species that are more thermally-sensitive, particularly in coral reef habitats (Nilsson et aI., 2009; Munday et aI., 2008), and the coral reefs themselves have undergone and are further expected to undergo bleaching and degradation with increased warming (Crabbe, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et aI., 2007). Increases in global annual temperatures are also associated with the spread of disease vectors and rises in heat-related deaths and allergies (Husain & Chaudhary, 2008; Shea et aI, 2008). The Arctic is a particular area of concern when it comes to global warming because as the snow cover melts, which reflects much of the incoming solar energy, more of the terrestrial cover is exposed, which absorbs energy rather than reflecting it, causing accelerated warming (Etkin, 1990). In Canada, Toronto and its surrounding area are of particular concern with regards to climate change impacts because of the potential effects that climate change is purported to have in this area. Toronto lies on the northern shore of Lake Ontario and is part of the Great Lakes Region. The Great Lakes are an important shipping pathway, as they are connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River. Climate is known to be one of the key aspects that contributes to fluctuating levels in these lakes (Changnon, 2004), and increased air temperatures have been related to lower water levels (Assel et aI., 2004). Future projections have indicated that higher temperatures, as associated with global warming, will lead to an overall decrease in

7

the water levels of all the Great Lakes (Mortsch et aI., 2000; IPCC, 2001; Lofgren et a!., 2002; Kling et aI., 2003), which could have detrimental implications for water management, hydroelectricity generation, transportation of goods, tourism and recreation and ecosystem sustainability (Chiotti & Lavender, 2008). Other potential climate change impacts for the

Toronto region include higher risks of floods due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (Hengeveld & Whitewood, 2005) and an estimated increase in premature smogrelated deaths by 15-25% by 2050 (Cheng et aI., 2005) from increased smog resulting from elevated air temperatures (Pelligrini et a!., 2007). Some action has already been taken on a regional level to implement adaptation measures. For example, the Toronto Region

Conservation Authority has implemented berms that increase the flood capacity in the Lower Don Valley by 15-20% and allowances have been incorporated so that they could be raised an additional 1-2 m in the future (Toronto Region Conservation Authority, 2006). However, Chiotti and Lavender (2008) have indicated that education and increased awareness oflocal and regional impacts is one of the keys in reducing the vulnerability of these areas to the effects of climate change through adaptation measures.

2.3

Strategies for Mitigation and Adaptation of Climate Change
Mitigation strategies are actions that reduce the amount of GHGs emitted to the

atmosphere, which would slow the development and extent of anthropogenic climate change (IPCC,2007b). Some mitigation strategies (current and future) for various industrial sectors are summarized in Table 1.

Landfill methane recovery; waste incineration with energy recovery; compos-Ung of organic waste; controlled waste watertrestrnant; recycling and waste minimization.

In addition to the actions that could be taken on the part of industry and individuals, there are a number of policy and market measures that have been and could be employed as mitigation strategies. Instruments, such as taxes on fossil fuels and carbon emissions trading, have the potential to be influential in the reduction of OHO emission (Schlesinger, 2006). Another one of these instruments, emissions trading, is sometimes referred to as a cap-and-trade system. In carbon emissions trading, emitters are given a certain level to which they can pollute. If they emit less than this limit, they can sell credits to other companies that cannot meet their targets (Australian Academy of Science, 2005). Subsidies for cleaner technologies and energy

conservation are also proposed as viable mitigation measures (Hoffert et aI., 2002).

Adaptation, on the other hand, is formally defined by the IPCC (2007a, p.6) as the "adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities", The possibilities for adaptations are wide-ranging, from new technologies (e.g., new irrigation techniques to deal with drought), to different behavioral choices (e.g., opting for new vacation destinations), to changing management strategies (e.g., using new agricultural practices), to policy changes (e.g., planning regulations) OPCC, 2007c). Although adaptation is necessary to counteract some of the effects of climate change due to GHGs that have already been emitted, there is only a limited amount being implemented (IPCC, 2007c) and most of the emphasis appears to be on mitigation strategies.
It has been argued that mitigation and adaptation should be implemented

simultaneously and are co-dependent, and adaptation should be considered in climate mitigation models to fully understand the outcomes of both types of strategies, Policies that fail to do so may not be fully effective (Kane & Shogren, 2000). There are many laws and agreements in place worldwide that aim to reduce the amount of GHGs that are produced. An example of an international agreement, perhaps being the most famous, is the Kyoto Protocol, which is part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement that has been ratified by 184 countries, including Canada. It is a document in which participating countries, in particular industrialized countries, commit to lower GHG emissions by set targets by 2012, which is the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, no date b). Targets for developing countries are to reduce their emissions by an average of five percent of 1990 levels, Countries are expected to undertake national practices in order to reduce their GHG emission levels and emissions must be monitored carefully and recorded (UNFCCC, no date b).

10

However, the Kyoto protocol also offers three measures that can also aid countries in meeting their targets: emissions trading, the Clean Development Mechanism (COM) and the Joint

Implementation (11) Mechanism. The COM is a tool used by countries that have been identified to require GHG emission reductions (known as Annex B Parties under the Kyoto Protocol), in which public and private organizations may invest in projects in developing countries that aim to reduce GHG emissions and promote sustainable development and technologies in those countries (Beauregard-Tellier, 2006). These groups receive emission reduction credits for their

investments, which may be applied to domestic GHG emission targets or sold to other parties. 1I is similar to the clean development mechanism, except instead of investing in emissions reductions projects, two or more Annex B Parties work together to implement such ventures in one of the Annex B home countries, thus promoting foreign investments and technology transfer in that country (UNFCCC, no date a). In Canada, many GHGs, including C02, CHt, N20 and many hydrofluorocarbons, are regulated under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (Environment Canada, 2009c), and in 2007, the Kyoto Pr%co/Implementation Act was enacted, which holds the federal government accountable for implementing the Kyoto Protocol (Environment Canada, 2007). Part of this act requires the government to develop a report, called a Climate Change Plan, each year that delineates the measures it will take to ensure that the Kyoto GHG reduction targets are met (Environment Canada, 2007): Many organizations encourage action on the part of individuals to counteract climate change. Examples of such groups include the David Suzuki Foundation (Canada), and Action for Climate Change (Australia). They encourage individuals to take actions, such as reduce garbage production, walk or use public transit instead of vehicles and reduce energy

11

consumption in the home to reduce the amount of GHGs emitted by individuals (Action for Climate Change, 2007; David Suzuki Foundation, 2009).

It is thus comprehensible that both government and individuals should be responsible for
solving the problem of climate change. There is a need for outlets that will relay information about the effects of climate change and solutions to policy makers and the public. The news media are an im portant means of communicating such information.

2.4

The News :Media
It is often the harmful effects of anthropogenic climate change and how governments or

. other interest groups attempt to mitigate or adapt to them that are shown in media coverage of this issue (Wilkins, 1993; Liu, Vedlitz & Alston, 2008). Anthropogenic climate change and many other societal issues have been portrayed in news media. It is first important to understand how they affect society in public opinions and policy agendas in general, which will be discussed first, followed by an examination of the current state of research with regards to the news media and climate change specifically_

2.4.1 The News Media and Public Issues
The news media are often a major source of information for the general public on many societal issues, since often many people are not personally involved in many events or issues, for example, government elections or foreign policy. A great deal of research has been completed in an effort to determine how the media affect policy agendas and public opinions. In agenda setting research, the studies typically involve both a content analysis of a given issue in various media forms and a survey, interviews or public opinion polls and data from both are compared and correlated to help in determining the media's influence in these issues. As Liu,

12

Vedlitz and Alston (2008) point out, the media usually have one of two functions in influencing public and policy agenda setting.

2.4.1.1 Role of the News Media in Salience The first role is the power of the media to change the relative salience, or how prominent a given issue is over time. Salience is defined by Chyi and McCombs (2004, p.22) as "the relative importance of an object - a public issue, a public figure, or any other topic - in the media or among the public." One of the first studies of this type that demonstrated this power was conducted by McCombs and Shaw (1972). The benchmark study focused on the community of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The issue that was examined was the presidential election

campaign that was occurring in 1968. A survey was conducted of 100 community members and a content analysis of relevant television news segments, newspaper and news magazine articles and prominent editorial was analyzed. Their findings suggest a strong relationship between the salience of the various issues in the campaign, as displayed by the media and what the voters viewed as important issues in the campaign. A number of other studies have been conducted to test the agenda-setting hypothesis. McLeod, Becker and Byrnes (1974, p. 137) define the agenda-setting hypothesis as when
an audience member exposed to a given medium agenda will adjust his or her perceptions of the important issues in the direction corresponding to the amount of attention devoted to those issues in the medium used.

McLeod, Becker and Byrnes (1974) conducted a study and interviewed 389 subjects who were potential voters located in Madison, Wisconsin. The participants were asked questions that determined which issues they perceived to be most important. These results were then compared to results from a content analysis of two local daily newspapers. The authors found that the agenda-setting hypothesis did not always hold true, especially in cases involving government

13

honesty issues, where respondents did not always consider them issues of importance. They also found that voters' decisions on election day were related to the perceived salience of the issue by the voters. Atwater, Salwen and Anderson (1985) tested the agenda~setting hypothesis at the sub-issue level. Content analyses were performed for three Lansing, Michigan area daily

newspapers. Phone interviews were also conducted with residents from the Lansing area to determine which environmental sub~issues they deemed most important. The six sub-issues used in this study were: 1) waste disposal, 2) water quality, 3) hazardous substances, 4) land quality, 5) air quality and 6) wildlife conservation. Their results indicate only a moderate level of correlation between the sub-issue salience, or the media agenda, and the importance indicated by the respondents. Edwards, Mitchell and Welch (1995) investigated the impOltance of issue salience in public evaluations of presidential performance in the United States. They performed content analyses on several television news pieces and newspaper articles relating to several different issues and compiled infonnation from 25 national opinion polls. Using time-series regression analysis, the authors conclude that issue salience is not stable over a given time frame and salience can affect the public's opinion about presidential performance. Miller and Wanta (1996) examined how the public viewed issues that were presented by two different sources, the news media and a state-of-the-union address by the American president. A telephone survey of 577 respondents in Tampa, Florida and Eugene/Springfield, Oregon was conducted, during which they were asked about their level of concern for twelve different issues. Content analyses of ABC News television pieces and one newspaper in each city that were published around the time ofthe state-of-the-union address were also performed. Regression analyses were performed on the data, the results of which indicated that the media played a stronger role in public perception of issues than the presidential message. Soroka (2003) used modeling to examine the

14

issue of foreign policy and its relationships with the mass media and the public in the United States and the United Kingdom. Public agenda measures were derived from public opinion polls in both countries and media agenda measures were obtained from content analyses of the New

York Times for the United States and the Times (London) for the United Kingdom. These inputs
were applied to Soroka's model. The results show that foreign policy salience affects the way that the public evaluates government leader perfonnance, for example, when foreign policy salience is high, the public tends to account for it more in their opinions of the leader, which may Jead to changes in foreign policy.

2.4.1.2 The Role of the News Media in Influencing Views
The second aspect that media agenda setting studies show is that the news media can influence the way that the public and policymakers view the issues, for example, either negatively or positively. In the McCombs and Shaw (1972) study that was previously discussed, some of their other findings imply some agreement amongst the news media in the values they present in their major news pieces. Cook et al. (1983) investigated the effect the news media has on how important the public and policy makers feel issues are. For the public, subjects were asked to watch an I8-minute television news piece about health care funding and fraud, and were asked questions regarding the importance of the issues presented before and after the news item aired. From the data analysis, the authors conclude that viewing the news story did indeed affect the importance with which the public viewed the issue, a finding which can be generalized for other types of media presentation and for many different issues. Policy makers were asked to simply complete a ten-minute interview; watching the news piece was not mandatory since they usually have staff who will keep them apprised of issues occurring in the media. They found that policy makers who had watched the news story on their own considered the issue more seriously

15

and were more likely to initiate action than their counterparts who had not watched. Wanta, Golan and Lee (2004) used a previously-conducted national survey and a content analysis of American news telecasts from four major television networks, whose content related to foreign countries, to examine how public perceptions are affected by the news media. Their results indicate two main findings. The first is that if greater coverage was provided by the media for a given country, the more the public is likely to believe that country is very important for American interests. The second is that negative coverage of a nation leads to the public gaining negative views of that nation. However, public opinions did not appear to be influenced by positive coverage. Because the news media can influence public perception, it has implications for government or policymakers' actions regarding the issue, possibly for finding solutions or alternatives.

2.4.2 The News Media and Anthropogenic Climate Change
It is clear that the media may indeed impact the way that society and policy makers acquire information, view issues, and take actions. There have been several studies conducted in relation to climate change and global warming and the news media. Despite the fact that many studies have already been completed, there still remain information gaps and areas for further research. There are several aspects of anthropogenic climate change and the media that have been studied to date. Many studies have dealt with themes, framing and values of climate change within the news media. A frame is a thematic unit that Tankard (200 I, pp.l 00-1 0 I ) defines as "a central organizing idea for news content that supplies a context and suggests what the issue is through the use of selection, emphasis, exclusion, and elaboration". Wilkins (1993) completed a content analysis of American news articles related to the greenhouse effect from the New York

16

Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Time Magazine and the Associated Press.
Wilkins's findings suggest that certain values (e.g., progress, institutionalization of knowledge and innocence) are key factors in framing climate change news. It also follows from these results that future aspects of climate change and showing global warming from the perspectives of a greater portion of society (e.g., social scientists, philosophers, citizens) are of lesser importance in the articles because of these values. Another study conducted by Trumbo (1996) involved a content analysis of ten years of climate change articles from five national US newspapers. From the analysis, it was determined that frames highlighting problems and causes were associated with scientists and those frames emphasizing judgments and solutions were linked to government officials and environmental and other special interest groups. It was also seen that the prevalence of scientists as information sources for the articles lessened as the issue of anthropogenic climate change became a more prominent issue for policymakers. Antilla (2005) studied
c1ima~e

change themes and frames as presented in several American regional and

national newspapers. Anthropogenic climate change was often framed as a debate, a controversy or uncertain. According to the author, this finding has the potential to affect a lesser Boykoff (2008b)

understanding of climate change by both the public and policy makers.

investigated climate change articles from four tabloid newspapers in the United Kingdom over the period from 2000 to 2006 via a Critical Discourse Analysis, semi-structured interviews and a framing investigation. The results show that the tabloids mainly frame climate change using weather events, biological species that have wide public appeal, the actions of politicians and other policy makers and relatively few articles centered on climate justice and risk issues. The author also found that many of the headlines generally gave inclinations that climate change should be feared and it is catastrophic in nature.

17

There are also studies that focus on bias in the coverage of climate in mass media. A study by Boykoff and Boykoff (2004) involved a contcnt analysis of climate change articles from 1988 to 2002 retrieved from the American "Prestige Press" (the New York Times, the
Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal). One of the major findings

was that an attempt to maintain journalistic norms in fact resulted in biased reporting of climate change information, which further led to inaccurate information being presented about the scientific consensus on global warming. Carvalho and Burgess (2005) used a critical discourse analysis of climate change-related articles from three broadsheet newspapers in the United Kingdom in their study. Their results indicate that how climate change is presented in a given newspaper is clearly connected to the political agenda of that newspaper, which may ultimately build an uncertain view of climate change by the public. Other studies have examined whether climate change is portrayed as having scientific consensus or is a controversial matter. Weingart, Engles and Pansegrau (2000) undertook a media discourse analysis of climate change information found in scientific publications, political discourses and newspaper articles in Germany from 1975-1995. They noted that there was scientific consensus on climate change in the academic literature, which they found to be ref1ected in the German news media discourse, rather than it being shown as a controversial issue. Conversely, in some American-based studies, the opposite is found to be true. A study by Zehr (2000) of global warming-related articles from large circulation newspapers in the United States (the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles
Times) over the period of 1986-1995 found scientific uncertainty to be a prominent theme, made

possible by representing climate change as a controversial issue. Similarly, Boykoff (2007) described an analysis of newspaper articles and television news stories and semi-structured

18

interviews with climate scientists and environmental journalists.

Analysis of these items

indicated that the media have presented climate change to the public as an issue of controversy, despite growing consensus by scientists that climate change is indeed occurring. The issues of salience and attention cycles with respect to climate change have also been investigated. McComas and Shanahan (1999) conducted a content analysis of climate change news stories from the New York Times and the Washington Post that appeared from 1980 to 1995. Their examination of climate change salience showed a cyclical pattern where climate change would gain popularity in some years, and then decline in others. They also found that when climate change salience increased, it was portrayed more as a dangerous issue and its consequences were emphasized more. Alternately, when global warming received less media attention, uncertainty among scientists was a more predominant theme. Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) also examined the issue of salience in their study of newspaper articles from the Houston Chronicle. They, too, found that salience of climate change in the regional newspaper followed a similar cyclical pattern, although they did not investigate the predominant themes at each point in the cycle. Their work also aimed to determine how climate change is portrayed at the regional level and found that it is often shown on an international or national scale and it is often connected to other societal issues, e.g., energy, agriculture, etc., as opposed to being simply an environmental issue. Regional is defined by Liu, VedJitz and Alston (2008, p.397) as "a limited geographical area, one small enough to experience climate change effects in fairly uniform ways, but large enough to include most of the readership of the area's largest newspaper". Another study by Taylor and Nathan (2002) explored the role of science in climate change coverage in British tabloid and broadsheet newspapers. The study observed that both types of newspapers use science as a major factor in representing climate change. The tabloids tended to use the science to

19

sensationalize climate change. Such overstatements were found to occur less frequently in the traditional newspapers. The authors also note that most of the articles present the consequences of climate change with only a small focus on the cause of climate change, which, the authors state, is possibly done to avoid making the readers feel as though if they lead a consumptive lifestyle, they may be a cause of the problem. A study by Bell (1994) focused on the

misreporting of anthropogenic climate change in New Zealand's daily media. The scientitic sources of several articles were identified, and they were sent a clipping ofthe article, along with a questionnaire inquiring about the accuracy of the piece. The majority of the articles (80%) were rated to be no worse than "slightly inaccurate", meaning that most of the facts portrayed in the articles were correct. Many of the sources also indicated that climate change was portrayed worse than what their own opinion of climate change was. Boykoff and Boykoff (2007)

investigated how well the news media adhered to journalistic norms in their analysis of American newspaper and television coverage of climate change from 1988 to 2004. One of their main conclusions from their analysis was that the adherence to first-order journalistic norms (personalization, dramatization and balance) can influence second-order norms (authority order and balance). They assert that this influence can lead to an information deficit, which could lead to inaction by policy makers. McManus's content analysis (2000) of seven Australian

newspapers' coverage of the Fourth Conference ofthe Parties to the Climate Convention (CON) in Buenos Aires that took place in November 1998 found that a disconnect, or "disanciation" (separation of cause and effect with respect to a given issue), was created by the media. The author found that in the articles, there were no links made to the daily lives of the Australian public, which caused the "disanciation". Coverage of climate change was also found to be minimal and was not enough to likely generate any public issue.

2.5

Summary and the Need for Current Research
Climate change is a pressing problem that has the potential to affect several environments

across the globe. As both mitigation and adaptation strategies to combat anthropogenic climate change should be employed to correct the negative impacts of global warming (IPCC, 2007b), solutions will likely involve decision makers from all levels, local, national and international. The media are large players in conveying information about climate change science and solution strategies to policy makers and the public. Studies that have looked at climate change in the news media thus far have investigated several topics, including the increased salience, themes and framing, presentation of scientific information, and bias, as they pertain to anthropogenic climate change. Still, there remains a need for further research. As Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) maintain in their study of regional newspaper articles, little information is currently available that provides insight into how local and regional areas receive information about climate change from the media and apply it to solution strategies for these communities. Their study is one of the few that deals with climate change representation by regional media sources. By comparing the regional and national aspects of climate change, insight could be gained into how the media could improve their representation of climate change to smaller scale communities. It will also assist in determining how climate change is portrayed at the two different levels, identifying the parties responsible for the implementation of solution strategies and the sources of the scientific information that is presented in the articles. Also, much of the current literature on climate change has has focused on media in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, and studying Canadian newspapers may provide a different perspective in this area, which could also be another topic for comparison in the proposed research. Since Canada and the United States are in such close proximity and have

21

many economic and social relationships, the proposed research also aims to examine how much the Canadian news media focus on the United States and other international countries. Determining how climate change is portrayed at the two different levels, identifying the parties responsible for the implementation of solution strategies and the sources of the scientific information that are presented in the articles may provide insight into how the media could improve its representation of climate change to reflect its impacts and possible solution strategies for a local region. This study uses the content analysis framework established by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008), in which they examined various aspects of climate change coverage in the

Houston Chronicle (a regional newspaper) from 1992-2005. These authors assert that it is
unknown if their findings are applicable to other regional newspapers and the limited timeframe should be extended in order to determine longer-term trends in climate change portrayal in the news media. This study aims to address these deticits by applying their methodology to both a national and a regional Canadian newspaper and extending the timeframe to 1988-2007.

Research l\fethodology
This section outlines the methodology that was used to complete the research. The

project objectives, the type of data that are used in the research, the framework after which this study is modeled, newspaper selection, sample size, development of the codebook and coding sheet, testing of the codebook and coding sheet, the methods of data analysis and problems and limitations in this research are detailed and presented here.

3.1 Project Objectives
The goal of this research thesis was to determine how anthropogenic climate change is represented in the Canadian news media, on a regional and national scale and whether they differ. The following objectives were proposed for a content analysis of articles from both a

regional and national Canadian newspaper that were published over a twenty-year period (19882007):
1. Determine the prominence (salience) of climate change in Canadian news media by

working out the total number of articles and the total word count for each year. 2. Assess the prominence of Canadian, American and other international content in the articles. 3. Examine various attributes regarding climate change as they are presented in the articles: issue image (positive vs. negative), issue scope (e.g., local, national, international), linkage to other issues (e.g., energy, agriculture, health). 4. Outline the types of climate change treatment solutions (mitigation vs. adaptation) that are presented in the articles and the parties that have an invested stake in climate change (e.g., government, industry, environmental groups).

23

5. Determine the number of articles that contain scientific information and establish the source(s) of that information. 6. Compare and contrast how climate change is depicted at both the national and local levels. 7. Discuss how decision makers and the public may be affected by the portrayal in the Canadian news media.

3.2 Type of Data (Primary vs Secondary, Qualitative vs Quantitative)
Primary data are those data gathered to address the specitic purposes of a given study, while secondary data are defined as data that have been generated for other uses, but may be used to answer other research questions (Peter, 2006, p.30). This study used a content analysis of articles from a national Canadian newspaper and a regional Canadian newspaper. The articles were not written with the intention of being used in this study, and thus the newspaper articles that were used are secondary data. The secondary data, however, is used in the content analysis to generate primary data that were analyzed to look for patterns in the portrayal of climate change in the Canadian news media. Content analysis, in basic terms, can be defined as "the systematic assignment of communication content to categories according to rules, and the analysis of relationships involving those categories using statistical methods" (Riffe, 2005). Generally in content

analysis, coding refers to the assignment of numbers that represent previously-specified characteristics to a given sample. The coding data are analyzed to find trends and relationships, which has applications in both quantitative and qualitative research (Neuendorf, 2002). Content analysis is typically completed by assigning numbers to different attributes in the articles, then recording this data for each unit of analysis (Neuendorf, 2002; Riffe, 2005). Then the aggregate

24

numbers can be analyzed for patterns. The data generated and used in this study is, therefore, quanitative data. A quantitative content analysis of the articles was chosen as the method for this thesis because it has been successfully used in several studies, but particularly in the Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study, which provides the structure for this thesis. The quantitative data can be a good indicator of trends in climate change portrayal in the news media.

3.3 Origins of Framework for Content Analysis
Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008), in their study of regional newspaper articles, express the need for more research and information that provides insight into how local and regional areas receive information about climate change science and solution strategies from the news media. Their study is one of the few that deals with climate change representation by regional media sources. They had many interesting and important findings, as discussed in the literature review (see Section 2.4.2), and thus the coding process that was used here was modeled after the coding process described in their literature. Their results were also used as a point of comparison with the regional results from this study.

3.4

Newspaper Selection
The Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study only concentrated on one regional newspaper,

the Houston Chronicle. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast cl imate change portrayal in Canadian newspapers at both the regional and national levels, and thus, the newspapers that were chosen were the Toronto Star (regional) and the Globe and Mail (national). The Toronto Star has the largest circulation count in Canada. In 2007, it had a weekly circulation count of 3,206,621 (Canadian Newspaper Association, 2008). The Toronto

Star is owned by a company called Torstar Corporation, which also has three other local

25

newspapers within Ontario in Hamilton, Guelph and Kitchener-Waterloo. The Globe and Mail boasts the second largest circulation in Canada with a weekly circulation count of 2,024,320 and is owned by CTVGlobemedia Inc. (Canadian Newspaper Association, 2008). Although the

Toronto Star has the largest circulation. most of its readership is based in Ontario, while the Globe and Mail is printed in and distributed from six different Canadian cities (Canadian
Newspaper Association, 2008). The two newspapers were chosen in part because they are both broadsheet newspapers, as is the Houston Chronicle, and also because of the accessibility to the articles online. There are two main national newspapers in Canada, the Globe and Mail and the National Post, which are both broadsheet newspapers. The Globe and Mail was chosen because the National Post only had articles available online through the Ryerson University library (the university where this study was undertaken) that were published from 1998 (the year it was founded) to the present, while the articles from the Globe and Mail were available from 1977 to the present. The

publication timeframe of the Globe and Mail is longer than the National Post and, therefore, provides more articles that can be analyzed. Since this study was undertaken at Ryerson

University in Toronto, Canada, a regional broadsheet newspaper was desired from the Toronto area. Since only one such newspaper exists in this area. the Toronto Star, the choice was 10gica1.

Toronto Star articles from 1985 to the present are also easily accessible through the Ryerson
University library.

3.5

Sam pIe Size
The newspaper articles were collected from the ProQuest database, which contained the

articles that were published in these two newspapers and is accessible through the Ryerson University Library. The articles were collected for the years 1988 to 2007. This period was

26

chosen because the database had these articles available for the timeframe and it is recent enough to include recent events related to climate change, for example, the release of the Fourth Assessment Report by the IPCC. The timeframe was also extended from the original Uu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study by six years in order to give a longer view of climate change portrayal in these newspapers.

3.5.1 Article Search and Selection Criteria
The search for articles was done separately for each newspaper. A search was done using the terms "greenhouse gas", "climate change" and "global warming". These three terms were the same three as used by Uu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008). In the search term box, "global warming OR climate change OR greenhouse gas" was entered, which allowed for the terms to be searched simultaneously in the articles. Each year was searched separately and the articles were copied and pasted into a word processing text document corresponding to that particular year. From the "date range" drop down menu, "specific date range" was chosen and the dates January 151 and December 31 sl of each year of the twenty years were entered as the limits of each date range. Another search was conducted using the additional terms "greenhouse effect" and "Kyoto protocol", also done by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008), but this search yielded no other articles in addition to the ones that were originally retrieved. Each article was then read and review for its relevance to climate change for inclusion in this study. Any article that simply mentioned global warming without it being the main focus of the article or linked to another issue was disregarded. Editorial, comment and opinion pieces, along with letters to the editor from readers were also discounted as their views may reflect those of a particular individual or organization.

27

A total of 7068 articles were found that contained these terms in the Toronto Star and 7761 articles were retrieved from the Globe and Mail. For the Toronto Star, 1482 of the 7068 articles were deemed relevant, while 1411 articles were obtained from the Globe and lv/ail selection.

3.6

Codebook and Coding Sheet Development
The content analysis coding process began with the generation of a codebook and coding

sheet that were used to analyze the Toronto Star and Globe and }.{ail articles pertaining to anthropogenic climate change. The codebook is found in Appendix A, and the Excel coding sheet, along with the raw data, can be found in Appendix B, respectively. The code book and coding sheet were developed in accordance with content analysis procedures that are outlined by Neuendorf (2002) and Riffe (2005). Many of the coding topics were adapted from the study of regional newspapers conducted by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008). These categories include issue salience (prominence), issue attributes (image, scope, linkage, participants, treatment solutions, responsible parties) and the use of scientific information in the articles, and are discussed in more detail in Section 3.8. In addition to these aspects, the codebook and code sheet allowed for the analysis of how many articles pertained to Canada versus other international countries. In the study completed by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) their only measure of issue salience was the number of articles related to anthropogenic climate change that appeared in the newspaper each year. In this research, the length of each article was incorporated into the codebook and coding sheet to provide another measure of issue prominence. In this study, there are over 2800 articles to be analyzed; thus, it was decided that the coding process should not be excessively detailed, but with sufficient detail to provide a good overview of how anthropogenic

28

climate change is portrayed in regional and national parts of the Canadian news media. The coding process is further detailed in Section 3.8.

3.7

Testing of Codebook
The codebook and coding sheet were tested with 100 randomly-selected articles. Liu,

Vedlitz and Alston (2008) used 50 randomly-selected articles in their pilot coding process, and the additional articles here allowed for more testing of the codebook, and also more coding practice for the coder. Three articles were chosen, without examination of the content, from each year of the first ten years of articles and seven from each of the last ten years. The reason for this is that there were generally much fewer articles each year in the first ten years of the study than in the ensuing ten. Articles of varying lengths (at least one under 500 words and one over 500 words) were chosen to see if the coding process could be appl icable to both longer and shorter articles. Some changes were made from the initial coding sheet and the methodology outlined by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008). In the Linkage category, during the testing phase, it was found that articles that related to housing had more to do with energy retrofits to housing and none related to housing and community in general. Thus, the Housing and Community sub-category that was originally in the Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study was eliminated because they would be more appropriately categorized under the Energy sub-category. In this study, governmental actors from all nations were included in the analysis, since government actors from other nations are not any less responsible for climate change solution strategies than solely the Canadian or American government would be, whereas the previous study only looked at governmental actors from the United States. In the Scientific Information category, Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) had a sub-category that coded whether scientific information was present, as

29

either "yes" or "no". This sub-category was found to be unnecessary and instead, a code to indicate no scientific information was included along with the types of scientific information, which is more consistent with other coding categories (refer to Appendix A). For the country of focus category, the most commonly occurring countries were found to be Canada, the United States and European Union countries and so these were made the main codes of this category. Finally, in the Responsible Parties category, the information presented by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) indicated that they only looked at whether government, non-government or no parties were responsible for climate change solution strategies. Through the testing process, some of the articles identified both non-government and government responsible parties, so a fourth code was added to this category to account for both types of parties being responsible. A few problems with the preliminary code book and coding sheet were observed. For multiple checks, meaning that more than one code may be entered for a designated category, there was an issue of defining how multiple checks would be allowed. It was decided that the same code was never entered more than once per article, for example, if there was more than one national leader mentioned in that category, it would only be coded once under "governmental actors". The reason for coding this way is because the purpose of this analysis is to see whether or not a governmental actor is present in a given article, not to determine how many governmental actors appear in the articles. Initially, for the categories that required multiple checks, only one extra column was added. Through testing, it was found that the Country of Focus and Issue Linkage categories required a third additional column, since the articles could be linked to several countries and other social issues. With respect to the Country of Focus

category, it was found that the countries mentioned most often were Canada, the United States

30

and those from the European Union, thus, these countries were the main codes that were chosen for this category to avoid having unnecessary sub-categories.

3.8

Article Coding
The 1482 Toronto Star articles and the 1411 Globe and Mail articles were coded by one

individual coder using the codebook and coding sheet that were developed (refer to Section 2.1 and Appendices A and B). The coding sheet that appears in Appendix B was arranged in an Excel spreadsheet and the data were entered directly into the spreadsheet to save time and paper resources. Each year of articles was separated into different tabs on the spreadsheet for ease of

analyzing the data and showing total numbers throughout the 1988-2007 period. The unit of analysis for this research thesis is the newspaper article, that is, each article was coded on its own and not sub-divided into further units (e.g., paragraphs) to be coded. Many of the articles required that more than one check be recorded per category, so this was allowed for in the codebook and coding sheet (refer to Appendices A and B). Each article was assigned a unique alphanumeric identifier, which was entered on the top left corner of the article and was recorded to keep track of each article and to be able to refer to the article at a later date. The article identifiers began with a "T" or "G" to denote the newspaper from which the article came, either the Toronto Star or the Globe and Mail, respectively. The coding categories are discussed in the following sub-sections.

3.8.1 Issue Salience
At the end of each article, facts about the piece (e.g., author, dateline) are provided by the database. The most important of these facts for this study with respect to salience (see Section 2.4.1.1 on p. 13 for definition) is the text count, which is the total number of words in that article.

31

The study conducted by Uu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) only used the annual number of articles as the sole measure of salience, although they do state that a physical article length gave a similar result. The text count was recorded to be used as a measure of salience of anthropogenic climate change, in addition to the number of articles relating to climate change that were published each year. The total text count was calculated for each year and compared to the number of articles per year to determine if this could also be used as an accurate indicator of issue salience.

3.8.2 Issue Image
The articles were coded for their portrayal of anthropogenic climate change. They were analyzed to show it as one of destructive (1), constructive (2), both (3) or neither (4). As Liu, Alston and Vedlitz (2008) assert in their study, there are several indicators that show that anthropogenic climate change is harmful in nature: environmental disasters, heath-related risks, death of humans or animal species, threat to infrastructure, land degradation, increase in severity and frequency of tropical storms and drought. It was found in this study through testing that several articles did not explicitly have any ofthese indicators, but anthropogenic climate change was often depicted as simply being a problem that needed to be rectified. As such, articles with phrases such as "fight climate change", "combat global warming" or similar were also coded as destructive. A constructive representation is indicated in a given article from the claim that anthropogenic climate change may be able to benefit some aspect of human life or the planet, for example, climate change causing increased agricultural productivity in certain areas.

3.8.3 Country of Focus
The country of focus was not a category in the Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study. Canada and the United States are in such close proximity and have many economic and social

32

relationships, so it is logical to examine how much the Canadian news media focus on the United States and other international countries. Thus, a new coding category was created, with the main focus being on Canada and the United States. The countries for this category were no country indicated (0), Canada (l), United States (2), European Union country (3 - anyone or more of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom) and other (4). For the European Union (EU) countries, if there was only mention of the EU itself and not an individual country from the EU, it was still coded as 3. Multiple checks were allowed for this category, because many articles were relevant to more than one country.

3.8.4 Issue Scope
This category allows for assessment of the physical geographical or jurisdictional level with which anthropogenic climate change is concerned. Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) use this category because the scope of this issue can be linked to policy; the level at which the articles are portrayed may influence which parties and/or governments are responsible for developing solutions to this issue. The sub-categories for issue scope were defined to be local/municipal (l), state or provincial (2), mulit-state or multi-provincial (3), national (4), international or global (5). Multiple checks were allowed for this category. For example, if an article contained information about climate change impacts in a particular city, then went on to discuss them on a global level, the article would be coded with both a I and a 5.

33

3.8.5 Issue Linkage
Since anthropogenic climate change is a global policy issue, it is reasonable to assume that it may be linked to other public and societal matters. This study used a total of I I issues to which anthropogenic climate change might be linked, which were taken from the Liu, Yedlitz and Alston study. These codes are: none (0), agriculture (1), defense (2), education (3), energy (4), health (5), international cooperation (7), land and water management (8), macro economy (9), science research and development (10), social order (11) and transportation (12). Multiple checks were allowed in this category because sometimes anthropogenic climate change was linked to more than one issue.

3.8.6 Issue Participants
Climate change as a public issue may involve a few or several participants in the debate or resolution to this problem. These interested parties may come from either or both of the private and political sectors. Multiple checks were also allowed for this category, as many articles implicated more than one of these groups.

3.8.6.1

Interest Groups
Interest groups were defined to be those organizations (or individuals) that were not

related to the government or government agencies. The codes for this category were: no interest group involved "(0), environmental (e.g., "think tanks", non-governmental organizations - 1), scientific-professional (e.g., universities, the fPCC - 2), industry (3), and other (e.g., consumer rights, church groups, First Nations organizations, polling/consulting agencies, aid groups etc. 4). The groups in the "other" sub-category did not appear frequently enough to justifY each having its own sub-category.

3.8.6.2

Governmental Actors
Governmental actors are those political actors presented in a given article that may be

involved in the climate change debate or finding solutions to it. If any of these people/parties were present, they were coded as no governmental actors present (0). national leader (e.g., president, prime minister, cabinet minister - 1). national legislative body (e.g., Senate,

35

CongressIHouse of Commons - 2), federal agency (e.g., Environment Canada - 3), court of any jurisdictional level (4) or local/state/provincial government (5). The local and state/provincial subcategories were combined because during testing, it was found that majority of the articles were portrayed on a national level, and there was not a great need for separate sub-categories.

3.8.7 Treatment Solutions
Climate change treatment solutions that are frequently presented in the news media have the potential to affect what the public and policy makers view as appropriate and effective solutions and who should be responsible. Thus, as in the Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study, coding .categories were included in this content analysis tor the types of treatment solution strategies suggested and the parties responsible that are identified in the article.

3.8.7.1

Types of Treatment Solutions
As presented in the IPCC (2007b) report, there are two main types of solution strategies

that should be used to fight climate change. The first approach is by mitigating climate change, which means to lessen the problem itself by reducing the amount of GHGs that are produced. The second method is adaptation, in which humans adjust their lifestyle or environment to cope with or take advantage of the effects of global warming. The codes for this category were: no solution strategy present (0), mitigation (including carbon taxes, emissions trading, cap and trade systems, reducing absolute GHG emissions or "emission intensity" - I), adaptation (2) or mitigation and adaptation (3) together.

3.8.7.2

Responsible Parties
This category allows for the recognition of whether the government or non-governmental

agencies should be responsible for a solution strategy that is presented in an article. If a specific

36

solution strategy is not specified in an article, but it denotes what group(s) should take action, then that article may still be coded as having a responsible party. The codes for the subcategories are as follows: no responsible party identified (0), government (largely involving some form of legislative action - 1), non-governmental party (2) or both government and nongovernment actors (3).

3.8.8 Presentation of Scientific information
Scientific research is important to the understanding of climate change, and the news media are a major source of this information for the public and it can also provide credibility to the information disseminated by the newspaper. Scientific information is defined by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008, p.389) as "empirical observation, identification, description and theoretical explanation generated by scientists, experts and analysts" and the same definition is used in this study. MUltiple checks were allowed for this category as multiple sources were cited in some

articles. The articles were coded as having scientific information from one or more of: no scientific information presented (0), academic source (e.g., university, IPCC, independent research organizations, etc. - 1), government source (e.g., federal government agency research laboratory - 2), environmental source (e.g., scientists associated with environmental advocacy groups - 3), industrial source (4) or other sources, including unidentified sources (5).

3.9

Data Analysis
After the results were compiled in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by year, the data were

prepared for analysis. The count for each subcategory in each category was tallied per year. A series of graphs were made for each category, including comparison and frequency graphs. The purpose of these graphs is to help identify frequency changes over the 20-year period from which

37

the articles were obtained and help to compare the data between the two newspapers over the course of the study; these are shown and discussed in further detail in Section 4. The results in Section 4 are shown using descriptive statistics and discussed and compared to other studies (see Section 5). A correlation analysis was performed with the assistance of Microsoft Excel

software to determine if there is a relationship between text count and total number of articles for issue salience. The square of the correlation coefficient (R2) value was examined to determ ine the strength of the correlation, and the p-value was used to determine significance. The R2 value is between 0 and 1, stronger correlations are indicated by values that are closer to 1 (Hopkins, 2000). The confidence interval that was chosen was 95%, which is often used in studies

(Hopkins, 2002), meaning that for the result to be statistkally significant, the p-value must be less than 0.05.

3.10 Problems and Limitations
One of the major limitations of this study is that there was only one coder (the author) for this project; as such, inter-coder reliability could not be assessed. Inter-coder reliability is the agreement of coding amongst two or more coders (Neuendorf. 2002). Since this aspect was not a part of this study, extensive testing was done on the coding process, coding sheet and codebook to ensure that the articles were analyzed in the most streamlined and organized way possible. Another limitation is the inexperience of the coder. The testing and development processes were also educational experiences and the testing allowed for coding practice. Intra-coder reliability, which is the agreement of the individual coder at different points in the coding process, was not tested for, since it was not mentioned in the original Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study and the content analysis resources (Neuendorf, 2002; Riffe, 2005) did not disclose any extensive information on the testing process for intra~coder reliability. The inability to test for inter- and

38

intra-coder reliability could raise questions about the accuracy of the results and the consistency of the coding process; therefore, future coding should incorporate these two tests. Some other limitations on this project were time and money. There were time constraints on the duration of research, as most universities have rules that research must be completed within a certain period (usually 2-3 years for a Masters thesis). More time would allow for the expansion of the time period from which articles were collected, i.e., enlarge the 1988-2007 time frame, which would lead to a larger sample size and possibly more detailed coding. Due to the volume of articles relating to climate change that were obtained, it would have been difficult to have more detailed coding, which may have been able to provide more insight into areas, such as the specific mitigation strategies used or proposed by policymakers (e.g., carbon trading, cap and trade, direct GHG emission reduction, energy conservation), or possibly expanding the way that the energy linkage category was used (e.g., further subdividing the category into new energy technology, energy conservation methods). There are also other measures that could have been used to measure media salience, such as article placement within the newspaper, and whether or not the article contained pictures. While this information was made available as part of the article details when downloading the articles, there were already two measures of salience that were coded, and some were left out due to time limitations. Money was also a limitation. With more funds, it might have been possible to hire coders to assist in the research.

Results
This section presents the results of the content analysis of the climate change-related

articles obtained from the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail from 1988-2007.

Graphs

displaying the frequency of the attributes and the changes in trends over the twenty-year period are shown for each coding category. The raw data generated in the coding process can be found in Appendix B. The total number of articles obtained from the Toronto Star and the Globe and

Mail, respectively, were 1482 and 1411.

4.1

Issue Salience
The first area of investigation in this research was to determine how the salience of

anthropogenic climate change changed throughout the timeframe (1988-2007).

The first

measure that was used is the total annual number of articles each year. These values are plotted in Figure 2 for both the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail. The number of articles each year tends to increase throughout the years 1988-2007. For the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, the average number of climate change articles in the first half of the study time period (1988-1997) is 29.6 for both newspapers, while for the second half (1998-2007), the averages are] 07.9 and III Increase. respectively, which is more than a three-fold

Jt was also observed that the annual total text count (Le., the total number of words for all the articles of a given year) could be used as an alternate measure of salience. Figures 3 and 4 show the article frequency plotted with the annual total text count over the course of the years of the study for the Toronto Star and the Globe and }.{ail, respectively.

42

From these figures it is clear that the annual total text count follows a similar trend as the annual number of articles, and therefore, it would be reasonable to use these two measures interchangeably. Strong correlations were seen when a linear regression analysis was conducted on the two variables for each newspaper. Correlations were found to be high, with adjusted R2 values of 0.9525 and 0.9859 for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, respectively, and p<O.05 for both papers (p

= 1.44 X

10- 13 for the Toronto Star and p

2.56 x 10- 18 for the Globe

and Mail).

4.2

Issue Image
Articles were coded as portraying one of four images: destructive, constructive, mixed, or

neither. Figures 5 and 6 show the portion of the total number of articles for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, respectively, that correspond to each of the four sub-categories. Based on the definitions that were assigned to each of the attributes in Section 3.4.2, it is clear that in both newspapers, anthropogenic climate change is portrayed mostly as a destructive image, and rarely as anything else.

Figures 7 and 8 show how the image of climate change changes from 1988 to 2007 for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, respectively. For both newspapers, over the twentyyear time span, the most prevalent image is clearly that of destructive or harmful. In the Toronto

Star, for the entire time period, the percentage of articles that were classified as anything other
than destructive never exceeded 7.4% (1995). However, the Globe and Mail shows a slightly different trend, with two years, 1991 (15%) and 1993 (43%), showing more than 10% of articles that are portrayed as non-destructive. This pattern quickly declines, and over the latter years of the study, the destructive articles constitute the largest portion of the articles. In general, for both newspapers, the percentage of articles that portray images other than destructive are seen in the earlier years, and becomes much less so towards the latter years from 1988 to 2007.

Figure 10: Comparison of Number of Articles Relating to Issue Scope for the Toronto Star and the Globe and 11.fail,1998-2007

From Figures 9, 10 and II it is apparent that the two main levels of scope that are portrayed in both the regional and national newspaper.ii are national and global/international. The proportions of national and global/international artides are similar for both newspapers; the Toronto Star had a total of 627 national and 588 global/international articles, while the Globe
and kfail had 651 national and

global/international pieces.

To see how the scope of climate cn<mg;e varies in the two newspapers from 1988 to 2007, area graphs were constructed for each newspaper and are shown in Figures 12 and 13. The two graphs show that national and international levels dominate the twenty-year period for both newspapers, however, the numbers of state/provincial and local articles increase noticeably during the latter ten years of the study timeframe.

4.4 Jurisdiction of Focus
Articles were cooed as relating to one or more of the following areas: Canada, the United States, a European Union country, other, or no jurisdictional affiliation. A comparison of the total number of articles for this category is seen in Figure 14.

Figure 13: Totals by Country for Anthropogenic Climate Change Articles from the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, 1988-2007

The frequency with which these jurisdictions appear is similar for both newspapers. A strong majority of the articles in both newspapers (1025 for the Toronto Star and 972 for the Toronto Star) are related to Canadian issues. The United States has a definite presence in the Canadian news media, appearing 271 times in the Toronto Star and 252 times in the Globe and Alai/. Countries in the European Union (105 times in the Toronto Star and )22 times in the

50

Globe and Mail) and other areas (132 times in the Toronto Star and 140 times in the Globe and Mail) occur less than half as frequently as the United States.
Figures 15 and 16 show how the jurisdiction of focus changes from 1988 to 2007. For both cases, it can be seen that majority of the articles each year focus on Canadian issues. Throughout the years, it is also observed that for each year the total articles with a United States focus is approximately equal to the number of articles relating to all other countries (EU countries and other combined), which is a fairly consistent pattern for both the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail.

Total # of Articles

Figure 16: Total Numbers of Articles Relating Climate Change and Other Issues in the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, 1988-2007

From Figure 17, it can be seen that the four strongest linkages, in decreasing order of strength, are international cooperation (425 articles in the Toronto Star and 492 articles in the

Globe and A1ail), energy (242 articles in the Toronto Star and 184 articles in the Globe and Mail), transportation (173 articles in the Toronto Star and 170 articles in the Globe and Mail)
and science research and development (166 articles in the Toronto Star and 112 articles in the

Globe and Mail).
In order to determine how the portrayal of various linkages changes throughout the period of 1988-2007, a slightly different approach was taken from constructing area graphs, such as in Figures 6, 7, II, 12, 14 and 15, since it is quite difficult to see eleven linkages on one area graph. For each linkage, the total number of articles each year containing that linkage was subtracted from the total number of climate change articles, as presented in Section 4.1. This 53

method allows for the observation of the linkages individually over the years. The weak linkage categories (agriculture, defense, education, health, land and water management, economy and social order) did not show any specific trends, nor did they substantially contribute to the total number of articles. An example for agriculture articles is seen in Figures 18 and 19 for the

Toronto Star and the Globe and Alai!, respectively.

Those articles with the greatest linkages were examined for their changes over the twenty-year period. The strongest linkages are with energy, international co-operation, science research and development and transportation. The changes in energy articles from 1988 to 2007 can be viewed for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail in Figures 20 and 21, respectively.

Issue Participants
The types of interest groups that are presented in the Canadian news media were coded

and identified.

These groups were divided in to non-government interest groups and

governmental actors.

4.6.1 Interest Groups
Any non-government interest group that was active within an article was coded as one of the following: environmental, scientific-professional, industry or other. Figure 28 shows the comparative numbers for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail for each type of interest
g~oup.

Figures 29 and 30 show how the frequency of the appearance of interest groups changes o\cr the ) e~1rs from 1988 to 2007. The proportions of each of the environmental, scientificprotessional and industry groups remain relatiycly constant throughout the twenty ) ears, but the presence ofl'thcr interest groups increases in both newspapers from 1998 to 1007.

Figure 30: Total Numbers of Articles Depicting Governmental Actors in the Toronto Star and the Globe and

Both newspapers are fairly equivalent in their representations of all the types of governmental actors defined here. Governmental actors at the national level (Le., national

leaders, national legislative bodies and federal agencies) are clearly the predominant ones shown in both newspapers. National governmental figures were portrayed in 858 articles from the

64

Toronto Star and 861 articles from the Globe and Mail. These numbers are considerably larger
than the local/state/provincial representations (286 articles). To see how the presence of government actors changes from 1988 to 2007, area graphs were constructed to show the proportions of articles in the Toronto Star (Figure 32) and the

Globe and Mail (Figure 33). Both newspapers primarily show national governmental actors
throughout the years 1988-2007. Local and state governments generally appear to a greater extent after 1997, in the case of both newspapers. Courts do appear, rarely, but more so after 2003 for both papers.

Treatment Solutions
The two types of treatment solutions for climate change effects are mitigation and

adaptation. This section aims to identify the types of treatment solutions that are covered by the Canadian news media and the parties that are responsible for their implementation (nongovernment or government).

4.7.1 Types of Treatment Solutions
The articles were coded for the types of treatment solutions as follows: no solution

presented, mitigation, adaptation, or mitigation and adaptation. Figures 34 and 35 show the total numbers and percentage for all articles coded from the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, respectively. These figures show that the main type of treatment solution illustrated in the two

66

newspapers is mitigation strategies, with 71 % of articles proposing mitigation strategies in the

Toronto Star and 74% for the Globe and Mail. For both news papers, approximately a quarter of
the articles (25% for the Toronto Star, 22% for the Globe and Mail) did not present any type of treatment solution at all. Adaptation strategies were not wel1 represented (3.5% for the Toronto

Star, 3.3% for the Globe and Mail), nor were articles that contained both mitigation and
adaptation (0.74% for the Toronto Star, 0.35% for the Globe and Mail). The proportions for each type of solution strategy are similar for the two figures.

4.7.2 Responsible Parties
Articles were also coded for the responsible parties to see where the Canadian news media portray responsibility for solutions strategies in the government or non-government's domain. Articles were coded as having one of the following responsible parties: none,

government, non-government or a mix of government and non-government parties. These total numbers and percentages ofthe total are shown in Figures 38 and 39 for the Toronto Star and the

Figure 38: Parties Responsible for Climate Change Treatment Solutions in the Globe and Mail, 1988-2007

From these two figures it can be seen that according to the media in this case, governmental actors are primarily responsible for climate change solutions, as roughly half of the articles in both newspapers (51 % for the Toronto Star and 53% for the Globe and Mail) portrayed a governmental authority associated with the climate change treatment strategies. About a quarter (26% for the Toronto Star and 24% for the Globe and Mail) of the articles did not specify any responsible party. Non-government parties were given responsibility in 14% of the Toronto Star articles and 12.27% of Globe and Mail articles. Mixed responsibilities, i.e., government and non-government (either the private sector or the general public) were held responsible in 8.9% of Toronto Star articles and in 11 % of Globe and Mail articles. Both

newspapers showed similar portrayals of responsible parties, in that the proportions of each type of responsible party are comparable. Figures 40 and 41 show the time series of frequencies of each type of responsible party for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, respectively, from 1988 to 2007. These graphs clearly show that the government is the dominant responsibility holder throughout the entire

twentyÂ· year period from which the articles were collected, in both the Toronto Star and the

Globe and Mail. Also, from Figure 41, in the Globe and Mail, non~government responsibility is
rarely shown before 1997; after 1997, there is a noticeable increase in the appearance of nongovernment accountability for climate change solutions. The Toronto Star articles do not exhibit this same pattern, rather some non-government responsibilities are fairly consistently shown all through the years 1988-2007.

Scientific Information
The goal of this section was to ascertain the different types of scientific information that

is presented to Canadian newspaper readers, since climate change information and the debate is highly dependent on scientific information. The various coding sub-categories used to classify the scientific information sources in the coding process were: environmental, industry or other, as outlined in Section 3.4.8. Figure 42 presents the total frequency of each sub-category of scientific information. The majority of the articles (947 for the Toronto Star and 945 for the Globe and Mail) did not contain any scientific information. Scientific information was presented slightly more in the Toronto academic, government,

Star (611 articles) than in the Globe and Mail (519 articles). Academic sources were the most
often used, with 349 used in the Toronto Star and 303 used in the Globe and Mail. Government

73

sources were used with less than half the frequency of academic sources for each paper (144 for the Toronto Star and 119 for the Globe and Mail). Environmental and industry sources were the least frequently used. Both newspapers had 24 articles each containing environmental sources. The number of industry sources used was quite similar; the Toronto Star had 13 articles based on information from industry sources, while the Globe and Mail had 15.

Figure 41: Total Number of Climate Change Articles Containing DilTerent Scientific Information Sources in the Toronto Star, 1988-2007

Changes in the use of the different types of information sources from 1988 to 2007 are shown in Figures 43 and 44. Both newspapers show somewhat similar trends throughout the timeframe, but there are a few anomalies to point out. Other information sources appear most in the Toronto Star from the years 1988 to 1992. It was observed during coding, that many of the articles from the beginning of the study included scientific information from unspecified sources, a trend which does not appear as much throughout the latter years of the study, as scientific research regarding anthropogenic climate change increases and progresses. In the Globe and

74

Mail, other information sources do not appear as frequently as they do in the Toronto Star from
1988 onward, but this is one of the times that they do appear more in the former. There is also a period in 1997 and 1998 in the Globe and Mail where other information sources appear more frequently. In 1992, in the Globe and Mail, virtually all of the articles contained scientific information and were from academic sources, an incident that does not occur again in any other year. Also, for both newspapers, environmental sources appear the most often in the late 80s and the late 90s.

Discussion
Overall, the representation of climate change does not differ greatly between the two

newspapers, the Toronto Star and the Globe and ~Mail. The total number of articles is similar for both newspapers, with the Globe and Mail having slightly less than that of the Toronto Star and each newspaper containing over 1400 articles. Generally, both newspapers show similar trends in their displays of anthropogenic climate change content with some deviations, which will be discussed further. The trends from Section 4 are analyzed and discussed in this section. category is looked at separately, beginning with issue salience. Each coding

5.1

Issue Salience
The salience of anthropogenic climate change increases throughout the twenty-year

period from which the articles were collected. In the first ten years of the study, the average number of articles during this time is 29.6 for both newspapers, and in the second half, the averages for the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail are 108 and Ill, respectively, which indicates a three-fold increase in the presence of climate change articles. Since there is such a large increase, it is logical to say that the public awareness of climate change has increased as well. During this timeframe, there are periodically some distinct swells in the annual number of articles, most of which relates to international agreements and talks that occurred in those years. Another characteristic about the pattern of salience is the cyclical nature of anthropogenic climate change coverage in both of the newspapers, referring back to Figure 1, with both

77

newpapers following similar patterns. There is a typical rise-and-fall pattern noticed here that has also been observed in past studies (Ungar, 1992; McComas & Shanahan, 1999; Williams, 200t; Liu, Vedlitz & Alston, 2008). There is low salience in the early 19905, which is consistent with previously-made observations (Ungar, 1992; Williams, 2001; Liu, Vedlitz & Alston 2008). However. the cyclical patterns are more prominent in the latter half of the twenty-year timeframe. In the Globe lInd Mail, salience remains relatively low until the 1997 peak (67 articles), declines slightly in 1998 and 1999 (63 and 56 articles, respectively), rises in the years 2000,2001 and 2002 (71, 74 and 163 articles, respectively), falls off again in 2003 and 2004 (68 and 63 articles, respectively) and then again rises in 2005 (110 articles), 2006 (146 articles) and 2007 (301 articles). The Toronto Slar pattern shows a clear decline in salience after 1990, a general increase between 1993 and 2002, with the exceptions of 1996 and 1998. After the 2002 peak (164 articles), there is a similar decline in 2003 and 2004 (55 and 61 articles, respectively), as seen in the Globe and .fl.tail, and substantial increases in 2005, 2006 and 2007 (120, l52 and 302 articles, respectively). Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) found in their study of Hous/on Chronicle articles that in 2005, there was a spike of articles that related climate change and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that year. This was not the case for either of the Canadian newspapers, likely due to the fact that these storms did not directly affect Canada or the region around Toronto as they would have in the coastal region in the area of Houston. climate chanae There is another notable characteristic of the salience of anthropoaenic t::> . t::> owr the twenty years. There are a few noticeable spikes during which greater numbers of climate change articles \vere published. for the Toronto Star, these spikes correspond to the years 1990, 2002 and 2007, as can be seen in figure 2. Reviews of the articles from each of

78

these years reveal that they correspond with various climate change-related events. In 1990, there were several articles related to the Second World Climate Change Conference held in Geneva, Switzerland that year, as well as the release of the First Assessment Report on climate change by the IPCC. The surge in articles in 2002 was largely due to coverage of the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol that year. Despite the increase in 2002 climate change articles, there is not a large spike in the Toronto Star in the year 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was signed. The reason for this is unclear. In 2007, the large rise in climate change articles is attributed to a UN climate change conference held in Bali, during which several countries aimed to develop a new international agreement on climate change that would replace the Kyoto Protocol after its expiry in 2012, and also, prior to that, the release of the Fourth Assessment Report .by the IPCC. The Second and Third Assessment Reports did not appear to cause major increases in climate change coverage in the years that they were released, 1995 and 2001, respectively. Some other key events in 2007 that received the attention of several articles were the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference held in Sydney, Australia in September and the signing of the Sydney Declaration on Climate Change that occurred there, as well as a meeting of the G-8 countries to discuss and negotiate climate change emission reductions in Germany in June of that year. A small increase in articles is observed in 1992, due to coverage of the Earth Summit conference held in Rio de Janeiro, during which a Global Warming Convention was signed by 153 countries in which they agreed to reduce GHG emissions, but with no specific targets. Although the salience of climate change has increased in newspapers at both the regional and national levels in Canada, the levels of GHGs continue to rise, making the problem of climate change worse, indicating that Canada is not meeting its targets for the Kyoto protocol. In 2007, Canadian GHG emissions totaled approximately 747 megatonnes, which is 4% higher than

79

2006 levels, 26% above 1990 levels and 33.8% over Canada's Kyoto Protocol target of 558 megatonnes (Environment Canada, 2009a). This fact suggests that despite the increasing

salience in the Canadian news media, the political decision makers are failing to take enough action to mitigate climate change. If the government does not show initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, it is difficult to expect individuals who reside in the country to do the same.

5.2

Issue Image
The eventual outcome of anthropogenic climate change is still largely unknown and it is

still currently difficult to say exactly how damaging or possibly beneficial its effects will be (Heal and Kristrom, 2002). It is likely that the media presentation of the image will affect the way that policies are developed in regards to anthropogenic climate change. For both newspapers, over the twenty-year time span, the most prevalent image is clearly that climate change is destructive or harmful. The prevalence of these types of articles is likely to promote this destructive image to the pUblic. The public should generally be aware from these articles that climate change is problematic and requires solution strategies in order to rectity this problem. From Figures 6 and 7, it can be seen that the Globe and Mail had more mixed (0.61% for the Toronto Star and 1.] % for the Globe and Mail), that is destructive and constructive together, and constructive (0.34% for the Toronto Star and 0.57% for the Globe and Mail). A possible reason for this could be that the two newspapers are catering to different audiences. In 1993, the

Globe and Mail had a large surge in articles portraying a neutral image. Reviewing the Globe and Mail articles from 1993 did not reveal a clear event or cause of this anomaly.

80

5.3

Issue Scope
The scope of climate change refers to the size of the geographical region or jurisdiction

that is impacted by anthropogenic climate change as implied or stated in the article. The scope of climate change that is portrayed may have implications for how the public views the ramifications of climate change and who should be responsible for its solutions. In both the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, it is observed that the majority of the articles are national and globallinternational (1215 of 1482 articles from the Toronto Star and 1210 of 1411 articles for the Globe and Mail). Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) also found that majority of the articles in the Houston Chronicle (a regional paper) were also on the national and globallinternationallevels. They assert that while this finding is logical due to the global scale of climate change and its effects, it may reduce action on the part of local and state/provincial authorities if they do not see it as part of their jurisdictional policies. When comparing the frequency of the scopes presented in the newspapers, it is seen from Figure 10 that the Toronto Star published more than double the number oflocal articles than the

Globe and Mail (134 compared to 64), which is reasonable since the Toronto Star is a regional
newspaper and would be expected to focus a certain amount of climate change articles from a local perspective. However, both of these values are still substantially lower than the values for national or global/international articles The number of articles devoted to state/provincial issues is consistent for both newspapers (156 for the Toronto Star and 155 for the Globe and Mail); similarly, the multi-state/multi-provincial numbers for both newspapers are comparable (43 for the Toronto Star and 54 for the Globe and Mail). Generally, over the course of the twenty-year period, for both of the newspapers, the distribution between national and globallinternational articles is fairly equal. In 2002, for both

81

the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, the largest portion of the articles are national-based; a review ofthe articles from that year reveals that it is likely due to the focus on countries' (mainly Canada's) strategies for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, which was ratified that year. The relative number of articles with a sub-national scope is fairly consistent over the years. At the national and regional levels, these two Canadian newspapers portray anthropogenic climate change in a similar manner, as a large-scale, national and international/global problem. Since it has been well established that the media have considerable influence over the way that the public and policy makers view various issues, it stands to reason that because the media are representing climate change as one with such a large scope, there is relatively little focus on the part of the public and government on finding smaller-scale

solutions, both mitigation and adaptation, at the regional community or even the individual levels. Cook et al. (1983) and Wanta, Golan and Lee (2004) have clearly demonstrated that the news media are influential in the way that the public views major societal issues and thus, there may be the perception that national and international bodies are the most responsible for climate change solutions. This aspect should be investigated further in future studies. It is clear that there needs to be more media focus at the regional level, since it has been shown here that majority of the articles in both the regional and national newspapers highlight national and international climate change issues. Every place on earth will not be affected by climate change in the same way. The example of regional effects in the Toronto and Great Lakes region, discussed in Section 2.2, shows how a specific area will be impacted by climate change. Thus, specific solution strategies may need to be developed for regional areas. The public and policy makers often use the media as a source of information (Weingart, Engles & Pansegrau, 2000). McCombs and Shaw (1972) observed the ability of the media to influence public

82

thinking through salience. If more attention is paid by the media to regional solutions, it would likely prompt the public and decision makers at the regional level to take action. Although climate change effects will very likely be felt at national and global levels, there are also regional adaptations that need to be considered, and thus awareness should be raised at this level. Larger scale effects may be easier to predict than more local impacts, but regional impacts will be felt and should thus be addressed in policy decisions.

5.4

Country of Focus
This category is included to determine how much content in the Canadian news media is

centered on Canada and other international areas, especially the United States, since the two are in such close proximity and have many economic and political interactions. As one might expect from Canadian newspapers, most of the articles have Canadian based content (1025 of 1482 from the Toronto Star and 972 of 1411 from the Globe and Mail). A fair number of articles (271 from the Toronto Star and 252 from the Globe and Mail) have ties to the United States, and roughly the same numbers were seen for all other countries combined, which speaks to the importance of Canadian ties to the United States. European Union Countries (105 articles from the Toronto Star and 122 articles for the Globe and Mail) and other countries (132 articles from the Toronto Star and 140 articles from the Globe and Mail) occur less than half as much as the United States in both newspapers. There are several instances where Canada and the United States are working together in international agreements, and therefore, they were both coded in the articles. One example is when Canada entered into the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate in October of2007 (the United States had previously entered in 2005), which aims to promote clean technologies and development strategies within its member countries (Asia-Pacific Partnership

83

on Clean Development & Climate, no date). Such examples express to the public the importance of international agreements as solutions to climate change and the need for countries to work together to find climate change solutions.

5.5

Issue Linkage
Anthropogenic climate change is an issue that can be linked to many social, economic

and political issues because of its wide-ranging effects. For example, drought caused by climate change could affect agricultural practices that are used and heat waves could have an effect on public health and energy consumption. For this reason, it is important to examine the links that are portrayed in the Canaqian news media, to establish which links are most prevalent. The strongest linkage for both newspapers that is observed from the content analysis is with international cooperation (425 articles in the Toronto Star and 492 articles in the Globe and

Mail), which is likely due to the coverage of international attempts to mitigate climate change
and its associated risks. There was much coverage devoted to climate-related conferences (e.g., the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992) and international. agreements (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol signing in 1997). The Toronto Star has 67 fewer articles linking climate change and international cooperation, partly due to the discrepancy noted earlier where the Globe and Alail saw an increase in articles in 1997 due to the coverage of the Kyoto Protocol, which was only seen to a lesser extent in the Toronto Star. Both newspapers also show reasonably strong links to three other categories: energy, transportation and science research and development. In Canada, 80% of GHG emissions can be attributed to energy production from fossil fuels, which consists of 44% from "stationary sources" (e.g., electricity generation, space heating, manufacturing, construction, etc.), 27% from transportation, and an additional 9% from "fugitive sources" (e.g., venting or flaming of gasses from landfills or mines) (Environment Canada, 2009b). Thus, with

84

such large sources of GHGs, it is logical that the media might focus on energy and transportation as areas in which GHG emissions could be reduced. Links to energy are made somewhat more often in the Toronto Star (242 articles) than in the Globe and Mail (182 articles). Transportation was coded 173 times in the Toronto Star and 170 times in the Globe and Mail, and is more or less covered equally by both newspapers. Many articles (166 articles in the Toronto Star and 112 articles in the Globe and Mail) are linked to science research and development. Zehr (2000) established, after an examination of scientific uncertainty in four major American newspapers, that scientific uncertainty was a prominent theme amongst the articles that were examined and that science was portrayed by the press as being an "authoritative knowledge provider for climate change" (p. 98), which may be used to provide a level of credibility to their stories. Smaller linkages are seen in both papers for economy, agriculture, land and water management and health. In contrast to this study, Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) found that in the regional newspaper, the Houston Chronicle, had a fairly strong linkage to climate change, which is not seen in this study. This may speak to the differences in American and Canadian emphasis on how society will be most impacted by climate change. An example is seen in some 2001 articles, when the Bush administration decided to reject the Kyoto Protocol, citing fears that its implementation could hurt the American economy. Energy articles make the biggest contribution in the late 1980s and early 1990s (until around 1991), decline around the mid 1990s and then start to appear more often after 1998. This trend is similar for both newspapers. It is also noted that during years when there is coverage of international conferences and treaties, the appearance of energy articles declines slightly, notably 1992 (Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro) and 2002 (ratification of the Kyoto Protocol), which is mostly likely due to increased coverage of such events.

85

It is quite apparent that international agreements get extensive coverage, particularly in years when there are major international treaties and conferences, e.g., 1992, 2002, 2007, thus they are portrayed as one of the major solution strategies to climate change. For the Toronto

Star. after 1999 there appears to be an increase in general of articles related to international cooperation; this same trend occurs a few years earlier, 1996 for the Globe and Mail articles. Science research and development also shows a relatively strong linkage to climate change in the articles from both newspapers. From Figure 23, for the Toronto Star, science research and development articles appear most from 1988 to 1991 and do not appear frequently again until after 1999. The period after 1999 shows that science research and development articles appear more in the years when media attention to climate change is relatively low (e.g., 2000, 2001, 2003-2006). A similar trend is observed in the Globe and Alail articles, from

Figure 24, although science research and development articles do not appear to contribute to the overall article total as they do in the Toronto Star. A handful of science research and

development articles are seen in each year from 1988 to 1996, and then increase each year after 1999, similarly following the pattern of the Toronto Star. Science research and development articles also decrease in 200] and 2007, relative to the years surrounding them. McComas and Shanahan (1999) observed that in periods when climate change media coverage declines, scientific uncertainty is a bigger theme, which may explain why more articles with sciencerelated issues appear when media coverage on climate change is decreased. In the Toronto Star, transportation articles appear fairly consistently throughout the twenty-year period from 1988-2007. There are a couple of years around 1995 and 1996 when there are no transportation-related articles, and a few years, 2000, 200 I and 2003-2006, when transportation articles appear more frequently than in 2002, which could probably be attributed

86

to increased media attention on the Kyoto Protocol ratification. In the Globe and Mail, in 1994, transportation articles account for roughly half of the articles presented. A review of the articles does not suggest any particular reason or event that might have caused such an anomaly. After 1997, the appearance of transportation-related climate change articles noticeably increases, with the exception of2002, similar to the Toronto Star.
It is important for climate change to be linked to societal issues to show the public and

policy makers the things that climate change affects and that these linkages may be part of the solutions to this problem. International cooperation, the strongest linkage, is very important because it makes countries aware ofthe science of climate change and prompts action from these countries .. Energy and transportation are also key aspects in climate change solutions, and they are being exposed to the public through the news media as such. Reducing GHG emissions from energy production and transportation is necessary to combat climate change, as seen from Table 1 in Section 2.3, and the public and decision makers need to be informed on these issues to find appropriate solution strategies. As Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) note, relating climate change and science in the news media may have both positive and negative consequences for policies. If climate change is portrayed as an uncertain science it could either prompt more government research and funding to increase knowledge about climate change (Meyer, 2006) or it could possibly cause confusion amongst the public and policy makers about the risks and solutions, which could eventually lead to fewer solutions implemented (Zehr, 2000; Boykoff & Boykoff, 2004). Despite the strong linkages to international cooperation, energy, transportation and science research and development, there are much fewer articles that connect the public and their individual lives to the topic of climate change. From Figure 17, it is apparent that issues such as

87

health (e.g., how climate change may cause increased health risks) and education (e.g., how climate change is being incorporated in school curricula), which might more relate to the daily lives of the public than the strongest linkages, are represented much less often than the largerscale issues (international cooperation, energy, transportation, science research and

development). McManus (2000) asserted that a lack of coverage relating directly to individuals may cause disconnect between the public and climate change, which could result in inaction towards mitigation and adaptation strategies on the part of the public. Other issues, such as defense and social order, were also found to be rarely liked to anthropogenic climate change, as seen from Figure 17. Climate change impacts have the potential to affect the way that society behaves as the planet changes. Food shortages brought on by increased occurrences droughts' could spark disruptions in social order and adaptations in defense and policing may need adaptation. This type of issue also goes hand-in-hand with health, as food shortages can lead to malnutrition. As these are more personal issues, it might be expected that the newspapers would provide more coverage of these issues to appeal to the public. That is not the case, as seen from the low numbers of articles relating climate change to these issues in Figure 17. The newspapers instead show the societal issues that are often more large-scale in scope: international co-

operation, energy, transportation and science research and development, which will likely to do little to inform the public about necessary personal day-to-day climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions (McManus, 2000). Similarly. policy makers will likely tend to focus on larger-scale issues
jf

they are the ones that the public feel are most important (Beder, 2002).

While the larger-scale issues are equally important as those that affect the public on a daily basis, Figure 17 shows an imbalance in their portrayal in the Canadian media. A wider variety of

societal issues, including smaller-scale issues and strategies to deal with these issues should be

88

shown because the media is a major player in influencing public opinions and policy decisions, and it may prompt more action on a regional level.

5.6

Issue Participants
There are many groups, both governmental and non-governmental, that have interests in

climate change.

A variety of both types of groups are found in the articles from the two

newspapers used in this study.

5.6.1 Interest Groups
For the Toronto Star, environmental (434 articles), scientific-professional (434 articles), and industry (391 articles) groups are fairly equal in prevalence. In the Globe and Mail, there is some variation amongst these groups. The numbers for industry groups (431 articles) and

environmental groups (418 articles) are fairly similar, but the presence of scientific-professional groups (332 articles) is lower. The Toronto Star seemed to place more emphasis on scientificprofessional groups, and the Globe and Mail portrayed industry groups slightly more than the

Toronto Star did, which may be due to the different audiences the newspapers are targeting.
While the proportions of each of the environmental, scientific-professional and industry groups remain relatively constant throughout the twenty years (Figures 28 and 29), the other interest groups do not show this same pattern. In both newspapers, other interest groups appear in the latter years of the 1988-2007 timeframe (for the Toronto Star, after 1998; for the Globe

and Mail after 1995). This observation is consistent with findings by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston
(2008). The appearance of other types of interest groups in the later years shows that

anthropogenic climate change gained interest and importance from more diverse sections of the

89

public and that more and more interest groups can and should become part of climate change action.

5.6.1 Governmental Actors
Government officials and agencies playa large part in creating and enacting policies. The coding of governmental actors aims to identifY the governmental actors that are involved in the climate change issue, and identify the jurisdictions they represent. Both newspapers primarily show national governmental actors throughout the years 1988-2007. Local and state governments generally appear to a greater extent after 1997, in the case of both newspapers. The presence of local and state governments in the news media is important because it signals to the public that these levels of governments also have a role to play in climate change solution strategies. Since national governmental actors appear more often in the two newspapers the public is still likely to be under the impression that most of the responsibility for climate change solutions lies with national government figures. Courts do appear, rarely, but more so after 2003 for both papers. This finding suggests that, while it does not yet seem to be a widely us,ed tool, it has become somewhat more popular for climate change lawsuits to be brought against government and corporations to ensure that action is being taken to mitigate this issue.

5.7

Treatment Solutions
Governments generally take action in response to public concerns (Rosenbaum, 1977;

Soroka, 2002). Fischer (1991) distinguishes six steps of the policy process during which the media have the potential to influence it, which include the articulation/identification of issues and the implementation of policies. Lambeth (1978) and Fico (1984) further suggest several

90

functions that the media have in the policy-making process. Alerting the public to problems, informing the public of policy proposals and solutions and contributing to the content of policy are among these roles. Fico's (1984) study suggests that the media actually have a greater ability to influence during functions that involve the transmission of information to the public, and less so for government actions in a legislative setting. Thus, the types of treatment solutions and the parties responsible that are presented in the news media will affect how the public views these issues.

5.7.1 Types of Treatment Solutions
Changes in the presentation of treatment solutions do not vary much over the course of the twenty years of the study timeframe. At both the regional and national levels, the Toronto

Star and the Globe and Mail appear to be interested in conveying information about solutions, as
roughly 75% of the articles in both newspapers involved the presentation of some form of climate change solution. The majority of articles in both papers (71 % in the Toronto Star and 74% in the Globe and Mail) focus on mitigation strategies (see Figures 33 and 34). While adaptation strategies are not portrayed to any great extent in either newspaper, it appears that in years where there are major international agreements, namely 1997 (Kyoto Protocol signing) and 2002 (Kyoto Protocol ratification) the number of articles with adaptation strategies seem to drop off in favor of those stories that focus on mitigation strategies, which is often the focus of these types of international accords. There is a need for the news media to focus on adaptation strategies. The results from this study and Liu, Vedlitz and Alston's 2008 study show a strong tendency for newspapers to represent mainly mitigation in their stories that present climate change solutions. While

mitigation is indeed necessary to reduce further anthropogenic climate change in the future, the 91

atmosphere has been impacted sufficiently to cause some degree of global warming (IPCC, 2007b) that may warrant current and future adaptation strategies to reduce the vulnerability of physical and human environments. Thus, a combination of the two types is necessary and should be reflected in media representations of anthropogenic climate change solution strategies.

5.7.2 Responsible Parties
Trumbo (1996) established that climate change frames in the news media dealing with judgments and solutions are associated with government officials and various interest groups. As such, the extent to which government and non-government parties are responsible for climate change solutions is examined here. For both newspapers, about half of the articles (51% for the Toronto Star and 53% for the Globe and Mail) illustrate that government parties are responsible for climate change solutions. Non-government and both government and non-government parties together account for 23% and 24% of the articles in the Toronto Star and the Globe and lvlail, respectively. Government parties are the main responsibility holders for the treatment of climate change solutions as portrayed by the two papers, but nonÂ· government parties (industries and individuals) also need to be shown more in order to inform them of what they can do to help combat climate change. It follows from Wanta, Golan and Lee's 2004 study, in which public perceptions were found to be influenced by media portrayal, that the representation of the government as more of a responsible party for climate change could influence the public in perceiving that they are not as accountable for climate change solutions. As McManus's study (2008) indicates, if fewer

associations are made about a given issue in the media to the daily lives of citizens, the public may feel disconnected and inaction may result.

92

The government is shown to be the dominant responsibility holder throughout the entire twenty-year period from which the articles were collected, in both the Toronto Star and the

Globe and l\1ail. From Figure 40, in the Globe and Mail, non-government responsibility is rarely
shown before 1997. After 1997, there is a noticeable increase in the appearance of nongovernment accountability for climate change solutions. The Toronto Star articles do not exhibit this same pattern, but show that non-government parties are responsible for climate change solutions fairly consistently from 1988-2007.

5.8

Scientific Information
Scientific information is important in the understanding of the problem of climate change

itself and the effects that it has on the earth, as discussed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Scientific information sources that are presented in the Toronto Star and the Globe and

lv/ail were mainly from academic sources (349 articles and 303 articles, respectively), with
government sources used about half as frequently in both newspapers. This finding is consistent with the Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) study that also found that most of the scientific information presented in articles originates from scientific-professional sources. It is possible that academic sources are the most frequently used because they are more abundant than government, industry and environmental expert sources and/or the newspapers deem the scientific information from scientific-professional sources as the most accurate and the most free of bias. Both newspapers show somewhat similar trends throughout the twenty-year timeframe, but there are a few anomalies to point out. Other information sources appear most in the Toronto

Star from the years 1988 to 1992. It was observed during coding, that many of the articles from
the beginning of the study included scientific information from unspecified sources, a trend

93

whkh docs not uppear as much throughout the latter years of the study. as scientific research
regarding anthropogenic clilllate change increases and progresses. In the Globe and Alail. other inl'twmation sources do not appear as frequently as they do in the Toronto Star from 1988
onw~lfiJ.

but this is one of the times that they do appear more in the former. There is also a

period in 1997 and 1998 in the Globe and Mail where other information sources appear more Ih:qucntly. In 1992, in the Glahe and Mail, virtually all of the articles contained scientific inlixm:ltioll and were from academic sources, an incident that does not occur again in any other year. Trumbo (1996) observed that over a
ten~year

period from J985-1994, the presence of

sdcntilic innmmniol1 sources actually declined. This finding is consistent with the observation here that the amount of scientific information in the Toronto Star declines from around 199011.)94. Thl! Globe and Mail articles do not exhibit a similar pattern, and the reason for this is not

apparent.
For hoth newspapers. environmental sources appear the most often in the late 80s and the

late 90s. The bte 80s corresponds to a time known as the second "green wave", in which environmental isslles were coming to the forefront in public opinion polls; the first occurred in the late 60s/early 70s (I1arrison. 1996). Environmental groups may have been pushing their own research in an

5.9

Other Comments
Overall, both newspapers portray climate change in a very similar manner. The coverage

is mainly national and international and majority of the solution strategies that are shown are mitigation strategies. This finding suggests that the Toronto Star, despite being a regional

newspaper, is treating climate change as more of a national issue, which is what might be expected from a national newspaper. The Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail are shown here to be quite similar in terms of climate change content and it is likely that othcr issues would be portrayed similarly (Le., from a national perspective) in both newspapers, despite the differences in scope. Although there is the need for both mitigation and adaptation to be implemented simultaneously (Kane and Shogren, 2000; IPCC, 2007a), it may be expressing to the public and decision makers the importance and dominance of mitigation as a climate change solution, when both are necessary to address this problem. Since it has been established that the media does indeed influence public opinion and policy decision makers (see Section 2.4.1), it would be logical to expect that regional newspapers would address more local and regional issues in order to address impacts and solution strategies that are pertinent to these smaller areas. The results from this study, however, clearly indicate that local climate change coverage is a relatively low priority for the two newspapers studied here, and particularly for the Toronto Star. There is a possi bility that journalistic behaviour could affect the way that climate change is presented in the media. Matters such as deadlines and lack of knowledge of the reporters could result in heavy usage of material from international and national wire services, for example, the Associated Press or the Canadian Press, respectively. If this situation is indeed the one that exists, it is likely that a higher level of national coverage would ensue, since these wire services often cover more national and international issues (Associated Press, 2009). While the

95

Toronto Star is a regional newspaper, it showed more of a national perspective with

to

climate change. It is likely that several of their climate change articles were obtained from various newswire services, which would diminish the number oftruly local articles printed in the Toronto Star, which is given by the relatively few local articles found in this newspaper from 1988-2007. It might be expected that a regional newspaper would provide a greater amount of regional and local coverage. but it is not the case here. This finding is also consistent with the regional newspaper (the Houston Chronicle) examined by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008), where most of the articles were either national or international in scope. The journalistic norms and pressures that journalists face and which affect media coverage of climate change are. highly influential in the communication between science and policy makers (Boykoff, 2008a). Climate change and events surrounding this issue that are covered by the newspaper provide a source of information to policy makers and especially the public. The press has a role in both reporting information and influencing the public. They attempt to report on the facts surrounding this issue, but their reporting can influence how the public views the issue. Boykoff and Boykoff (2004) found that biased reporting often results when journalistic norms are maintained, which could lead to the inaccurate presentation of scientific information and consensus. While policy makers may receive multiple sources of information, the public often relies heavily on the media, so for the many members of the public, the media may lead the debate on climate change and influence perceptions. There also remains the question of whether the media is leading the debate on climate change or simply following it. It could be argued that it is doing both. The media's general purpose is to report on events that have occurred, so in some sense it should be reporting on the debate and its actors. The various actors that in the debate often include the ones

96

observed in this study, mainly from various national government bodies and almost equally amongst interest groups. On the other hand, the political agenda of a given newspaper, in addition to journalistic norms and behaviours, likely affects the way that the newspaper chooses to portray these climate change events. The events that they to portray will shape

relations and discussions amongst scientists, decision makers and the public (Boykoff, 2008a).

97

6 Conclusions
The aim of this study was to determine how parts of the Canadian news media portray anthropogenic climate change over a 20-year period at the national and regional levels, using a content analysis for two Canadian newspapers, the Toronto Star (regional) and the Globe and
Mail (national). The content was analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine how content

patterns varied over the time period. Issue salience was measured, as were several other aspects of the climate change problem: the place of origin of the content, its image, prospective

solutions and factions responsible for these solutions, the actors involved in this issue (both governmental and non-governmental), and scientific information associated with this issue. The objectives are listed below, along with a discussion of the findings for each objective.

6.1

Review of Objectives

Objective #1: Determine the prominence (salience) of climate change in Canadian news media
by working out the total number ofarticles and the total word count for each year.

It was determined that the total number of articles and the total word count each year follow a very similar pattern and show a strong correlation, and thus, either measure could be used to describe salience. Overall, there is increasing coverage of climate change in the two newspapers that were examined in this study. The results also show a cyclical pattern, a rise and fall of salience in the two newspapers, which is consistent with other findings from similar studies (McComas & Shanahan, 1999; Liu, Vedlitz & Alston, 2008). There are also years that have larger numbers of climate change-related articles relative to the surrounding years (1990, 2002, 2007). These years are consistent with certain climate change events that occurred in those

98

years:

the Second World Climate Change Conference and the release of the IPCC First

Assessment Report in 1990, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in 2002, and the UN Bali climate change conference, the release of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the signing of the Sydney Declaration on Climate Change by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 2007.

Objective #2: Assess the prominence o/Canadian, American and other international content in

the articles.
Articles were coded for the countries that were present in each article. The majority of the articles involved Canada (69% for both newspapers). The second most prominent country was the United States (found in 18% of articles in both newspapers), which is likely due to the close proximity of the two countries and the strong econom ic ties between the two countries. The European Union countries and other countries occurred much less frequently.

Objective #3: Examine various attributes regarding climate change as they are presented in the

articles: issue image (positive vs. negative), issue scope (local. national, international, etc.), linkage to other issues (e.g., energy, agriculture, health, etc.).
The climate change articles from both the Toronto Star and the Globe and ,Mail were coded for each of the attributes. The results show that climate change is portrayed mainly as a destructive or harmful problem. Positive portrayals and mixed portrayals were less evident. The scope of climate change, as shown in the two Canadian newspapers, is largely on the national and international levels, which is consistent with American findings from Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008).

99

The articles were coded if they were linked to other public issues. The strongest linkages were to international cooperation, energy, transportation and science research and development. Table 3 provides a summary of the percentages ofthe articles that pertain to each linkage.

International cooperation showed a strong linkage because of a great deal of coverage of international agreements and conferences. Energy and transportation also receive a lot of

attention because they are causes of global warming and many climate change mitigation opportunities lie in these areas. Science research and development is a strong linkage because science is important in understanding the causes and effects of climate change, as well as in finding solutions.

Objective #4: Outline the types ofclimate change treatment solutions (mitigation vs. adaptation)
that are presented in the articles and the parties that have an invested stake in climate change (e.g., government, industry, environmental groups, etc.).
Both non-governmental and governmental groups were found to appear frequently in both the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail. Non-governmental groups (industry,

environmental, and scientific-professional) all appear with similar frequency, which is summarized in Table 4. Other types of non-governmental interest groups (e.g., church groups) are portrayed more frequently after 1998.

Mitigation is the dominant type of climate change solution strategy that appears (in 71 % of Toronto Star articles and 74% of Globe and Mail articles), while adaptation and mixed strategies are shown much less frequently (less than 4% in both newspapers). Government parties are responsible in roughly 50% of the articles in both newspapers, while non-government and mixed (government and non-government) parties are shown in approximately a quarter of all articles in both the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail.

Objective #5: Determine the number ofarticles that contain scientific information and establish

the source(s) of that iriformation.

101

Approximately 75% of articles contain some fonn of scientific or expert infonnation. Most of this infonnation comes from scientific-professional sources, while industry, government and environmental sources appear less frequently.

Objective #6: Compare and contrast how climate change is depicted at both the national and

regional levels.
Overall, climate change is portrayed similarly in the Toronto Star and the Globe and

Mail, with a few minor exceptions.

The Globe and Mail portrayed climate change as

constructive (in 0.57% of articles) and mixed (in 1.1 % of articles) slightly more than the Toronto

Star (0.34% of articles constructive and 0.61 % with a mixed view). There are more articles
focused on the local level in the regional Toronto Star (9% of articles) than in the national Globe

and Mail (4.5% of articles). In terms of interest groups, the Globe and Mail showed more
industry groups (431 articles) than the Toronto Star (391 articles), and the Toronto Star represented more scientific-professional groups (434 articles) than the Globe and Mail (332 articles). Even though there are small differences in portrayal, the two newspapers represent climate change more similarly that what might be expected from two newspapers with such differing scopes, suggesting that there may, in fact, not be many differences in general between the two levels of newspapers.

Objective #7: Discuss how decision makers and the public may be affected by the portrayal in

the Canadian news media.
Climate change was largely portrayed as a large-scale national and international problem. Many of the government leaders that were shown in the articles were national leaders and

102

government is shown to have the most responsibility for climate change solutions. This finding would suggest to the public that much of the solutions should come from national government figures and bodies and might imply that individuals do not need to assume as much responsibility as the government. A strong linkage to international cooperation speaks to the importance of international agreements as climate change solutions. Strong linkages to energy and transportation inform the public that these issues are the main causes of climate change and also have the greatest potential for mitigation opportunities. The association of climate change and science research and development show the need for scientific research in the understanding of climate change, but scientific uncertainty may lead to debate and inaction. Mitigation

strategies are most commonly portrayed in these articles, suggesting that these are the most important solution strategies.

6.2

Contributions to Knowledge
The body of existing literature that deals with climate change and the news media

continues to grow. This is an important area of work because the news media are an important avenue for conveying information about climate change science and solution strategies to the public and decision makers. This study took an existing content analysis framework that was used by Liu, Vedlitz and Alston (2008) in their study of a regional newspaper, the Houston Chronicle, and applied it to two newspapers, one at the regional level (the Toronto Star) and one at the national level (the

Globe and Mail). By applying their framework to both the national and regional newspapers,
differences and similarities in the portrayal of climate change between the two levels were identified. This study tested the Liu, Alston and Vedlitz (2008) methodology when applied to another regional newspaper and a national newspaper. The previous study was conducted in the

103

United States, where many studies of the climate change and news media have occurred in the past (e.g., Zehr, 2000; Boykoff & Boykoff, 2004; AntiI1a, 2005). Other climate change and news media studies have largely come from the United Kingdom (e.g., Carvalho & Burgess, 2005; Boykoff, 2006), New Zealand (e.g., BeU, 1994) and Australia (e.g., McManus, 2000). The application of the framework to Canadian newspapers allowed for the investigation of another country's perspective on climate change. Anthropogenic climate change is currently an important political issue. This study

reviewed and critically analyzed this topic and assessed public perceptions may be influenced by portrayals in the news media. Salience levels of climate change were also investigated.

6.3

Recommendations for Future Studies
While this study provides a great deal of insight into the aspects of anthropogenic climate

change that are portrayed in the Canadian news media at the national and regional levels, there are several factors that still remain to be investigated. This study examined a twenty-year period, but the timeframe could be extended to include years to explore climate change prior to 1988 and any subsequent years after 2007 for future studies, as current events involving climate change could influence its salience in the news media. Also, in order to achieve a better picture of anthropogenic climate change representations in the Canadian news media, more newspapers at each level, national and regional, could be used in the content analysis, instead of just the two used here. There are several other regional newspapers across the country and to see if there are regional differences amongst these newspapers would be worthy ofinvestigation. It may also be interesting to determine if there are major differences in the way that anthropogenic climate change is presented in broadsheet newspapers versus in tabloid newspapers. The coding process could be made more detailed, for example to include specific types of mitigation strategies.

104

which wou Id allow for the examination of how such strategies have evolved since this issue has entered the public domain. The coding elements that were chosen mainly looked at the portrayal of climate change itself. Further coding elements could be included that would address some journalistic behaviours in reporting on climate change. For example, having a code for the origin of the article would provide insight into the numbers of articles that are written by staff writers or simply pulled off of the newswire to fulfill a deadline. Another approach might be to compare and contrast climate change coverage in multiple countries to see if regional coverage differs in those countries. Within a given country,

especially one as big as Canada, it would also be useful to investigate different regional newspapers and perhaps more local newspapers to investigate whether there is in fact a difference between national and regional newspapers. Newspapers from varying types of

regions should be studied to observe regional differences in climate change portrayal, for example, rural vs. urban, arctic vs. prairies, as different types of regions have differing interests in terms of climate change impacts and solutions. For example, the arctic is identified by the IPCC (2007b) as a region of particular concern with regard to climate change impacts since accelerated warming has been observed in this region, affecting the ecosystem and human habitat there. Rural farming communities, on the other hand, could experience either increases or

decreases in cereal production, depending on the extent of global temperature increases in the future (fPCC, 2007b). A future content analysis could explore various newspapers from the different regions to see if the media climate change coverage there accurately retlect the climate change impacts and solutions strategies particular to those areas. Rather than simply comparing newspapers on the local/regional and national levels, this type of analysis would provide a truly regional look at anthropogenic climate change coverage.

105

This study only used descriptive statistics in the analysis of the data.

However,

relationships amongst the various attributes could be examined, which would require further statistical analyses. For example, is there a relationship between the countries presented and the interest groups and/or government parties? Are there relationships amongst the linkages? Are there statistical relationships between the types of solution strategies and the interest groups or responsible parties? Other measures of media salience could also be investigated to give a wider picture of salience, such as article placement or picture accompaniment. The research presented in this study could very well be complemented by qualitative analysis techniques. Such methods could help determine how many other aspects, such as

. journalistic norms, reporters' attitudes and beliefs, new scientific information or natural/physical and policy incidents (Uu, Vedlitz & Alston, 2008) shape the depiction of the problem of anthropogenic climate change by the Canadian news media. Also, the use of interviews or

public opinion polls about climate change along with the content data could provide some insight into how the Canadian public is actually influenced by the news media with regards to anthropogenic climate change.

6.4

Conclusion
Climate change is an issue of growing concern, and the increasing presence of it in the

news media is evidence of this fact. The national and regional newspapers investigated in this study both mainly depict climate change as a large-scale national and international issue, despite the differences in scope. Public perceptions can be influenced by the representations in the news media, and as a large-scale, global problem, anthropogenic climate change is often portrayed in the media as such. Personal impacts and solutions, for example, health issues and region-

specific adaptations are rarely shown, and thus, a greater focus on regional and local climate

106

change solutions and effects is required, Since different areas may need region-specific mitigation and adaptation solutions. The news media have been, and will remain, important in communicating information to the public and decision makers about the science of climate change and solution strategies.
