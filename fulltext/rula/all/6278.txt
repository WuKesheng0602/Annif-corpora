ABSTRACT

Photochemical Degradation of Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes (BTEX) Using UVIH 20 2 Durkhani Kakar MASc., Environmental Applied Science and Management Program Ryerson University Toronto, 2010

The oxidation of benzene, toluene, ethy Ibenzene, and xy lenes (BTEX) by advanced ox idation processes in water was investigated. The degradation of BTEX by UV-185 and UV254 nm in conjunction with
Hz~

was studied. It was observed that the recommended

Hz~

concentration to degrade 100 mgTOCIL of BTEX was 250 mglL and 300 mglL for UV-185 and UV-254 nm, respectively. In addition, it was observed that using the lamps in series did not have any advantages in the TOC removal of BTEX. Under acidic condition, pH 3, UV185IH20 2 removed 10% more than UV-2541H20 2. At the recommended H20z concentration, 90% of BTEX mineralization was occurred with UV-185 nm/ H2~ under acidic condition of pH 3. It was observed that 21-32% BODnDC ratio of BTEX was decreased with an increase in residence time (within 140 min) in the photoreactor.

CHAPTER! INTRODUCTION

Preserving and protecting the environment have become of prime importance. Due to the exponential increase in human population, industrial developments, and human activities, there are higher levels of environmental pollutants. Water, one of the most valuable resources, is polluted by these organic contaminants. In the United States, the treatment of wastewater did not receive much attention before the 1900, because the release of wastewater into large bodies of water did not present such a nuisance and health problems as it does today. In the early 1900s, the health problems caused by wastewater brought about an increased demand for more effective means of wastewater management (Metcalf and Eddy, 1991).

Wastewater treatment technologies including physical, chemical, and biological methods are classified into three main categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments. They are widely used to remove contaminants from wastewater to achieve different levels of contaminant removal. These treatment processes include screen, oil, and grease removal units, dissolved air floatation, adsorption, stripping, coagulation, flow equalization, filtration, disinfection, biological treatment including any combination of aerobic lagoon, anaerobic lagoon, facultative lagoon, activated sludge process, and/or other biological. treatment processes (US EPA, 2002). In 2008, the world's total daily production of crude oil was over 73 million barrels (E1A, 2009). Over 9 million barrels of 73 million barrels were processed into gasoline (EIA, 2009). Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) are components of gasoline-

derived contaminants. BTEX are also widely used as industrial solvents for organic synthesis and equipment cleaning (Shim et aI., 2005). The BTEX components of petroleum products are of particular concern because of their toxicity. These chemicals are prone to be released to the environment through continuous accidental spills from road surface, domestic waste, and major leakage from tankers, pipelines, industrial activities, and storage tanks. BTEX are relatively soluble and they migrate with the groundwater (Lovley, 1997).

The biodegradation ofBTEX has been studied both aerobically (Zilverntant; Mason et a!., 2000; Schreiber and Bahr, 2002; Shim et aI., 2006) and anaerobically (deNardi et aI., 2007; Lovley, 1997, Shim et at, 2006). The results of these studies show that the biodegradation is a common degradation process for BTEX in aquifers and soils. The aerobic processes are commonly utilized in the contaminated fields and research to degrade BTEX. Under proper conditions, microorganisms can be cultivated to remove BTEX. However, biodegradation processes take a long time to degrade BTEX. Borden et al. (1997) demonstrated that toluene can be biodegraded in a petroleum contaminated site under methanogenic condition only atler a lag phase of 60 to 246 days. Aquifer materials from contaminated sites can degrade low concentration (1.4 mg/L) of BTEX aerobically (Cho et aI., 2006; Bahr and Schreiber, 2002). It has been shown that in nitrate reducing experiments, benzene and ethylbenzene were not degraded by indigenous microorganisms during the course of 4 months of experiment (Alvarez and Vogel, 1995).

Most existing water treatment processes have limitations and are not cost-effective. Among other chemical processes, an attractive alternative to the degradation of toxic and recalcitrant chemicals in wastewater is advanced oxidation processes (AOP). AOPs are fairly new technologies, which have developed in the last 35 years (Zhou and Smith, 2001). AOPs have become predominately important due to their ability to rapidly remove pollutants from

2

wastewater. AOP has emerged as an effective method for purifying water and air (Mathew, 1987). AOP produce highly reactive intermediates, mainly hydroxyl radicals ("OH), which oxidize chemicals unselectively. These processes can be combined with UV irradiation. The energy from the UV wavelength is able to break a chemical bond and hence produce a free radical. These radicals henceforth attack the organic pollutants and mineralize them. Though relatively expensive, complete mineralization of organic compounds is possible through the photolytic reaction. Lee et al. (2001) reported that using AOP to treat 400 m3/day textile wastewater would cost 55% more compared to the use of the intensified biological treatment. Therefore, it is important to optimize the parameters ofthe AOP to render it cost-effective.

BTEX were chosen for this study because these compounds are notorious as pollutants in groundwater, soil, and air. Available data support that BTEX are hazardous to human health and benzene is a possible carcinogen.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW

This chapter contains three parts. Section 2.1 describes the properties of BTEX. Section 2.2 presents a review of experimental and field work perfonned on BTEX, and Section 2.3 is a review of AOP processes.

2.1. BTEX
2.1.1. Presence ofBTEX in Environment
BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) are hazardous pollutants that are found in the air, water, and soil. BTEX are volatile mono-aromatic hydrocarbons, which are commonly found together in crude petroleum and petroleum products. Benzene can be found in synthetic rubber, plastic, nylon, insecticides, paints, dyes, resins-glues, furniture wax, detergents, cosmetics, and cigarette smoke. Toluene is used as a solvent for paints, coatings, gums, oils and resins. Ethylbenzene can be found in paints, inks, plastic, and pesticides. Printing, rubber, and the leather industries use xy lenes as solvent. In addition, BTEX are used as diluents in nuclear hot laboratory cells (Skarabakova et aI., 1994). Typically, BTEX make up about 18% of gasoline. The breakdown of BTEX in gasoline is as follows: 11 % benzene, 26% toluene, 11% ethylbenzene, and 52% xylenes by weight (Health Assessment Section, 2008). When gasoline contacts water, BTEX accounts for 90% of the soluble fraction of the gasoline components in water (Bolduc et at, 2002).

2.1.2. Health Effects
To limit human risks and to attain the aesthetic quality of drinking water, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined guideline values for these components as follows: benzene, 10 ,.t1/L; toluene, 700 J..lI/L; ethylbenzene, 300 J..lI/L ; and xylenes, 500 J..llfL (WHO, 1993). Exposure to any of the individual chemicals can cause neurological impairment via parent chemical-induced changes in neuronal membranes. In addition, benzene can cause hematological effects, which may ultimately lead to aplastic anemia and acute myelogenous leukemia. There is evidence that ethylbenzene is carcinogenic in other tissues (ATSDR, 2004). The potential health effects of exposure to BTEX at levels higher than the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) are presented in Table 2.1.

2.1.3. Properties of BTEX
At room temperature, BTEX are colourless and flammable volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Most people can begin to smell benzene in air at 1.5-4.7 parts of benzene per million parts of air and smell benzene in water at 2 mg/L. Most people can begin to taste benzene in water at 0.5-4.5 mg/L. One part per million is approximately equal to one drop in 40 gallons (ATSDR, 1997). For toluene, Alexander et at (1982) reported that the odour threshold is 0.024 mgfL and two taste threshold measurements of 0.12 and 0.16 mgiL (average value 0.14 mglL). They reported two odour thresholds of 0.0016 and 0.0032 mg/L (average value 0.0024 mgfL) for ethylbenzene and two taste threshold measurements of 0.064 and 0.08 mg/L (average value 0.072 mgfL). For xylenes, Middleton et a1. (1958) stated that taste and odour cou ld be detected at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 mgIL.

The molecular weights ofBTEX range between 78-107 g/mol. The BTEX have a low solubility in water except for benzene (1755mgIL). The physical properties of BTEX are

listed in Table 2.2. The vapor pressure and the Henry's law constants are listed. The vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure of the gas in equilibrium with respect to the liquid at a given temperature. The vapour pressure dictates compound's tendency to evaporate. High vapour pressures mean that the compound is more likely to volatilize out of solution. The
0-

xylene has the lowest vapour pressure (8.72 x 10-3 atm). This means that the o-xylene will volatilize slower compared to the other BTEX. The property of a chemical that expresses its partition between water and air is the Henry's law constant, which predicts the behaviour of an organic compound in the environment. It also predicts the movement of organic matter from water to air and vice versa. High values means that the chemical compound will move toward the gas phase, while low values predicts that it will stay in the aqueous phase (Petrucci and Harwood, 1997). The Henry's law constant of toluene is relatively greater than the other BTEX; this indicates that toluene will escape a water solution faster than benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes.

2.2. Previous Work on the Degradation of Aqueous BTEX
The natural attenuation ofBTEX has been documented at many sites where the BTEX were biodegraded primarily by indigenous microorganisms. Laboratory work has been perfonned in a closed system to demonstrate the biodegradability of BTEX by various microorganisms. Several peer reviewed papers (deNardi et aI., 2007; Shim et aI., 2005; Chakraborty et aI., 2005; Schreiber and Bahr, 2002; Flyvbjerg et aI., 1993; Prenafeta-Boldu,

2002) have been published to demonstrate the biodegradation of BTEX under aerobic and
anaerobic conditions.

deNardi et al. (2007) demonstrated that 75-90% of BTEX can be removed when

treated in conjunction with the addition of protein, carbohydrates, and ethanol in a bench scale horizontal-flow anaerobic immobilized biomass reactor. Shim et al. (2005) have studied the degradation of BTEX as the sole carbon source under aerobic and hypoxic condition by the coculture of P. put ida and P. jlurorescens in a defined mineral salts medium. H20 2 dissolved in water with catalase were used as the additional Oz source and no aeration was provided to avoid stripping of the BTEX. Concentrations of BTEX up to 150 mglL were used. The results of the aerobic studies of BTEX show that the biodegradation is a common process in aquifers and soils. Aerobic processes are more commonly utilized for the degradation of BTEX. However, in soil and groundwater, oxygen is often depleted. Due to the low water solubility of oxygen in groundwater, the flux of oxygen will not be enough to support aerobic degradation. Depending on the experiments under proper conditions, microorganisms are able to degrade the components of the BTEX. Chakrabony et al. (2005) demonstrated that
dechloromonas aromatica (strain RCB) is capable of anaerobic degradation of benzene under

nitrate reduction. In addition to nitrate, dechloromonas aroma/ica could alternatively degrade benzene both aerobically and anaerobically with perchlorate or chlorateas as suitable electron acceptors. Furthennore, with nitrate as the electron acceptor, strain RCB could also utilize toluene, ethylbenzene, and all three isomers of xylene (onho, meta, and para) as electron donors.

Under anaerobic conditions, the biodegradation pattern for these compounds israther complex. Under strict anaerobic and sulfate reducing conditions, benzene and ethylbenzene were not degraded by aquifer-derived miroorganisms (Edwards et aL, 1992; Wilson et aL,
1986). Under strict anaerobic conditions, where sulfate was the tenninal electron acceptor,

Ed ward et at. (1992) demonstrated that toluene and the three isomers of xy lene were
9

completely mineralized to C02 and biomass by

aquifer~derived

microorganisms.

The

biodegradation under denitrifying conditions are less favorable. Benzene cannot be degraded with nitrogen as the terminal electron acceptor (Schreiber and Bahr, 2002). The degradation of a-xylene otten depends on the existence of primary substrates, either toluene or phenol (Flyvbjerg et aI., 1993). Due to this cometabolic bellavior, lag periods are prolonged for degradation of xylenes and ethylbenzene (Hutchins et aI., 1991). TabJe 2.3 summarizes the removal efficiency of the BTEX degradation under different conditions. The studies on the degradation of BTEX demonstrate that BTEX can be consumed by microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, These two processes can take several days to several months. On the other hand, degradation of BTEX under AOP takes only a few minutes to a few hours.

Not applicable because degradation was not significant Daifullah and Mohamed (2004) studied the degradation of BTEX by the UV

irradiation of the magnetically stirred clear solutions containing 100 mg/L BTEX in a quartz cylindrical flask (12 cml ) at 20Â°C. The UV lamp (high pressure mercury lamp) emitted 300 nm light. The oxidant used in their experiments was H20 2. More than 90% of BTEX were removed within the first 10 minutes irradiation.

Cho et al.; (2006) studied solar photocatalytic degradation of BTEX.

The solar

reactor had 8 quartz tubes (1.524 cm diameter), which were connected to 8 modules with width and length of 75 cm and 100 cm respectively. The total volume of the 8 quartz was 0.73 L. The quartz tubes were packed with 1.0 \\1% Ti02 slurry. The 8 modules and 8 quartz tubes were connected in series, the contaminated water flow through these moduJes and
13

quartz then back to the lOL reservoir at a rate of 3 Llmin. The UV wavelength from the sun was 365 nm. In their study, the solar light'Ti02 slurry system degraded more than 70% of BTEX within 4 h.

2.2.1. BTEX Intermediates
Some of the potential aromatic and aliphatic metabolites of BTEX are benzoate (C 6 H 5C0 2), catechol (C6 H4 (OH)2), 3-methylcatechol (C 7 Hg 0 2), 4-methylcathechol (C 7 Hi OZ)' succinate (C 4 H60 4) and adipate (Alvarez and Vogel, 1995). Phenolic intennediates are produced during high dosage of HzO z with p-xylenes (Stephan et aI., 2000). During toluene oxidation, benzaldehyde (C7H60) and benzoic acid (C6HjCOOH) have been detected (Hisahiro et al. 2002). Ouidri and Khalaf (2009) reported that during photo-oxidation of toluene, the major intennediates fonned are benzaldehyde (C7H60) and p-cresol (C7HgO). In addition, traces of benzyl alcohol (C6HjCH20H), benzoic acid (C 6 H5COOH), pyrogallol (C6H6 0 3 ), and hydroquinone (C 6 H4 (OH)2) were also found. A t the early stage of photocatalytic degradation of gaseous benzene in the air streams experiment, phenol (C6H60) was identified to be the major intennediate produced (Wang, and Ku, 2003).

2.3, Advanced Oxidation Processes
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) refer to a set of chemical treatment processes designed to remove organic and inorganic materials by oxidation in wastewater and drinking water. The AOPs are promising technologies for the removal of contaminated ground and surface water as well as wastewater containing non-biodegradable or inhibitory organics to microbial groMh. These processes generate free radicals ('OH), which are highly reactive and therefore attack organic chemicals mineralizing them or converting them into less harmful or lower chain compounds (Gogate et aI., 2004; Legrini et aI., 1993; Zhou and Smith,

J4

2002). In AOPs, the organic radicals are formed either by photolysis of the organic substance
or by reaction with hydroxyl radicals ("OH) (Legrini et at, 1993). The products of the organic molecules could be intermediates, or at the final stage, HC03",

cr, NO)-,

CO 2, and H20. The oxidation of organics is defined by the extent of their

degradability to the final oxidation products as follows (Braun and Oliveras, 1997): Â· Â· Primary degradation, which causes structural change in the parent compounds. Satisfactory degradation, a primary degradation that reduces the toxicity or converts nonbiodegradable organics to biodegradable ones. Â· Complete mineralization or ultimate degradation, changing the organics into C02 and water. Â· Improper degradation, a change in the structure of the parent compounds in a way that increases the toxicity of the wastewater. The major advantages of the AOPs are their ability to remove a wide range of chemicals (Stefan et aI., 1996; Aye et aI., 2004), and their ability to destroy the organic compounds without transferring them to another medium or generating secondary waste disposal problems. In wastewater treatment, UV/03 and UV/H202 have been successfully used to degrade organic compounds (Bolduc and Anderson, 1997). To improve the generation of radicals, UV-light can be coupled with different chemicals: UV- H202; UV-Ti0 2; UV-03; and UV-fenton reagent. The radicals generated by different AOPs are listed in Table 2.4 (Gulyas, 1997).

2.3.1. UVI "202 Process
In this research, UV and UV with H202 were used to degrade BTEX. The UV/H2 0 2 combination is one of the most widely used AOP for various wastewater treatment methods. For instance, Beltran et al. (1993) studied the treatment of atrazine in water using a

Toor and Mohseni (2007) studied the treatment of raw surface water containing disinfection byproducts using a UV/H 202 process with a H20 2 concentration of 0-23 mg/L. It was observed that the UV/H202 process was effective in reducing disinfection byproducts at a UV dosage greater than 1,000 mJ/cm

Tabrizi and Mehrvar (2006) reported

an optimum HZ02 concentration of 720 mgIL for the degradation of a 100 mgIL solution of aqueous linear alkylbenzene sulfonate in a pilot-plant photoreactor with the UV - 254 nm. Depending on the photochemical properties of the pollutants, UV alone may be used to remove pollutants from the water if they can absorb light at the specified wavelength. In order to improve this process, H20 2 can be added to enhance the generation of hydroxyl radical. The major reactions including literature values of relevant quantum yields or rate constants for organic compounds (RH) involved in a UVI thOz process are summarized in Table 2.5 (Legrini et at, 1993; Crittenden et al.. 1999; 10hnson and Mehrvar, 2008). The mechanism most commonly accepted for the photolysis of H202 is the cleavage of one H20 2 molecule into two hydroxyl radicals (OH) per quantum of radiation absorbed, which is shown in Reaction (2.1) (Legrini et aI., 1993; Crittenden et aI., 1999; Tabrizi and Mehrvar, 2004). When an organic compound (RH) presented in water and wastewater, the reactions between generated hydroxyl radicals and organic pollutants may be differentiated by the mechanisms of Reactions (2.1) to (2.10). The final step in the reaction is the combination of radical-radical (Reaction (2.3) (Legrini et aI., 1993). Due to its highly reactive nature, other water constituents such as carbonate and bicarbonate can react with hydroxyl radicals, where hydroxyl radicals react to thOz. therefore causing a reduction in the overall efficiency of oxidation process with respect to the contaminant of interest. Hydrogen peroxide is commercially available. It has a minimal capital investment, thennally stable, and very soluble in water. The energy required for the 0-0 bond to break in hydrogen peroxide is 48.5 kcallmol. The energy supplied by the short wavelength UV light is sufficient to break 0-0 bond (Clarke and Knowles, 1982). These properties make H10 Z an advantageous oxidant for the industrial wastewater. Hydroxyl radicals are able to attack
17

pollutants unselectively by adding to the double bond (Reaction 2.11), extracting a hydrogen atom (Reaction 2.12), transferring an electron to a halogenated compound (Reaction 2.13) or by producing an organic radical (Reaction 2.14) as listed in Table 2.S.

2.4. Biodegradability of Organic Chemicals
Many factors affect the organic biodegradability of chemicals. The most important factors to consider in biodegradability tests are: chemical structure a nd concentration; source and quantity of microorganisms; and the physicochemical conditions in which the test is performed. The structure of the chemical compounds is important because it detennines the solubility and volatility of the substance, which detennine its bioavailability. It also dictates the accessibility of active sites in molecules, which are attacked by enzymes of degrading microorganisms (Boethling and Alexander, 1979). The concentration of chemicals establishes the toxicity ofa substance to microorganisms (Madsen et aI., 1991). Various species of microorganisms live in different environmental conditions. Some are able to immediately degrade chemicals, completely or to an extent. Other microorganisms have to develop appropriate enzymatic mechanisms for degradation (Grady, 1985). Biodegradation could be a result of action of a single species of microorganisms, but more often it occurs due to the combined activity of several microbial species. Tn addition, am ixed culture usually has a higher biodegradation potential and is the actual carrier of biodegradation processes in the environment (Broholm et aI., 1993). Physicochemical conditions are important because they detennine the behaviour of substances and microorganisms. The quantity and the quality of nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, etc.) affect the growth of microorganisms. The quantity of oxygen present, pH, temperature, and light affect the performance of microorganisms and the compounds in waste water (APHA, 1998).

2.5. Theoretical Chemical Oxygen Demand (TCOD)
The theoretical COD value of a specific compound is calculated from a stoichiometric ratio. If this theoretical value corresponds to the experimental value, it is concluded that the oxidation of the organic material is complete. The theoretical COD of a compound with a structural formula, CxHyOz, can be determined from the two redox equations that describe the overall oxidation reaction (Petrucci and Harwood, 1997).

(2.25)

From Reaction 2.25, it can be noted that the theoretical oxygen demand of one mole ofa compound CxHyOz demands to 1,4'(4x+y-2z) moles of O2Â· The molar mass ofCxHyOz can be expressed as (12x+y+16z) g/mol and the molar mass of oxygen is 32 grams. It is concluded that the COD of (12x+y+16z) grams of the compound CxHyOz is equal to y..Â·(4x+y-2z)Â·32 gÂ·(4x+y-2z) g O2 Â· Hence the theoretical COD per unit mass of CxHyOz is

When the procedure of the COD test is strictly followed, for almost all compounds, the experimental result will not differ more than a few percent from the theoretical value. This leads to the following two conclusions: 1. During the COD test, the organic materials are completely oxidized 2. The precision and reproducibility of the test are good Equation (2.26) can be used to calculate the theoretical COD per unit mass for different structural formulas CxHyOzÂ· Equation (2.26) was used to calculate the theoretical oxygen demand of BTEX. The total theoretical COD of a solution was calculated by mUltiplying the concentration of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes by its COD per compound value as sho\\'n in Table 2.6. The total organic carbon (TOC) of a solution was determined by multiplying its concentration by the carbon to molecular weight ratio.

Based on the literature review, biological process is a common process to degrade BTEX, however it is a slow process that could take up to months. It can only treat low concentration of organic contaminants. It is difficult to apply to the remediation of highly contaminated sites. BTEX are also hazardous and volatile therefore, it is necessary to treat them immediately to avoid any health and environmental effect. AOP can be used as an ex-

22

situ remediation method. To date limited studies have been performed on BTEX with AOP. Therefore the objectives of this study were as follows:

Â· Â·

To determine the degradability ofBTEX by UV-185 and UV-254 nm To determine the recommended concentration of H202 to degrade 100 mgTOC/L of BTEX using UV-185 and UV-254 nm

Â·

CHAPTER 3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND
METHODOLOGY
3.1. Materials
Materials used in experiments are as follows:

3.1.1. BTEX
The following BTEX were used in experiments: benzene manufactured by EMD with GC assay of 99.0%; toluene manufactured by BDH with GC assay of 99.5%; ethylbenzene manufactured by Alfa Aesar with GC assay of 99%; and xylenes manufactured by J.T.Baker with GC assay of99.9%.

3.1.2. Hydrogen Peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide is a pale blue liquid that appears colourless when in dilute aqueous solution. It has a molecular weight of 34.04 glmol with a density of 1430 gIL. It is used as a disinfectant, an oxidizer, and a bleaching agent. It is a weak acid with strong oxidizing capability. In this study, hydrogen peroxide (30 wt% with density of 1110 giL) was used as the oxidizing agent.

24

3.1.3. Catalase
The catalase enzyme is available in two fonns, namely bovine liver and Aspergillis
niger.

Catalase bovine liver manufactured by Calbiochem with a molecular weight of

250,000 kDa was used in this study. Each mg of catalase consisted of 2380 units (1 unit is the

amount of enzyme that catalyses the reaction of 1 nmol of substrate per minute) and it was stored at 5Â°C. The bovine liver catalase has the abllity to decompose hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide concentration less than 200 mgIL can be removed effectively by adding 2.5 units/mL of catalase and leaving it undisturbed for 2 h (Ito et aI.,
1998).

Each molecule of catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains composed of more than 500 amino acids. Four porphyrin heme groups are located within this tetramer. The heme group is responsible for the catalase enzymatic activity. To date, the exact mechanism of the catalase catalysis has not been precisely detennined, but the reaction is believed to occur in two steps (Boon et aI., 2008).

Where Fe-E represents the iron center of the heme (the cofactor) attached to the rest of the enzyme (E). The heme consists of a proptoporyphyrin ring and a central iron (Fe) atom. A protoporphyrin ring is made up of four pyrrole rings linked by methane bridges. Four methyls, two vinyls, and two propionate side chain are attached. The bovine liver catalase was used prior to the BOD testing. The concentration of H20 2 was measured using the H202 kit (Section 3.2.5). Once the concentration of H20 2 was determined, catalase was added to the sample and the sample was left undisturbed for 2 h.
25

Subsequently, the sample was used for BOD analysis.

3.1.4. Removal of Hydrogen Peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide is a known bactericide and therefore it should be removed from the solution prior to using it for the biological oxygen demand (BOD) testing. In the experiments of this study, the bovIne liver catalase was used to remove H20 2 from the BTEX solution treated with UVI H202. The structure of catalase and its mechanism for tb02 removal is explained in section 3.1.3. Hydrogen peroxide Lovibond CHECKIT was used to determine the concentration of th02 in solution, refer to Section 3.2.4 for method of measurement of H202. According to Ito et al. (1998), when solution contains less than 200 mglL of H202, the H202 can be removed by adding catalase and leaving it undisturbed for 2 h. This procedure was pursued in the following experiments.

3.1.5. Methanol
Methanol manufactured by EM Science with a GC assay of 99.99% was used in the preparation of gas chromatography calibration solutions.

3.1.6. Other Reagents and Materials
The deionized water produced by the MILLIÂ·RX-75 deionizer was used for all experiments. Polyseeds, the BOD seed inoculum capsules, manufactured by Interlab Co were used in the BOD tests. The procedure for using the Polyseeds is discussed in Section 3.2.5.2. The H2 0 2 measurement kits were used to quantify H202 in the samples, as discussed in Section 3.2.5. The Accu-Test Twist caps vials with digestion reagent manufactured by Bioscience Inc. were used for the COD tests, as discussed in Section 3.2.7. All chemicals (KH 2P04, K2 H P0 4, NaHp04.7 H20 , N~CI, MgS04.71hO, FeCL).6H20, CaCI2) for the BOD experiments were purchased from Aldrich Canada as discussed in Section 3.2.6.

3.2. Analytical Methods
Wastewater is characterized in terms of its physical, chemical, and biological compositions. The analysis used to characterize wastewater varies from precise quantitative determination of chemicals to the more qualitative determination of biological species. In the next section, the analytical methods used during these experiments are described.

27

3.2.1. Determination of BTEX Concentrations
The BTEX concentration was analyzed using a Gas Chromatography (GC), PE AutoSystem GC with built-in Autosampler. BTEX were transferred from 10 mL aqueous samples to the vapor phase by bubbling helium (He) gas for 11 min through the aqueous samples contained in the purging chamber of Tekmar 2016 purge and trap auto sampler at ambient temperature. After purging, the trap was heated and the compound was desorbed and transferred into BO-WAX column (30 m x 250 11m) in a Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL, which was equipped with flame ionization detector. Both the injector and detector temperatures were set at 200Â°C. The temperature of the oven was set at 45Â°C remaining constant for 3 min, after it was ramped up at a rate of lOoe/min to a maximum temperature of 350Â°C. The total run time was set to 10 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 45 mUmin and the retention time for BTEX was 2-8 min. Figure 3.1 illustrates a sample of GC chromatogram for the determination of BTEX concentration.

3.2.1.1. Sample Preparation for GC Calibration

The stock solutions for BTEX were prepared by dispensing 9.8 mL of methanol into a 10 mL glass-stoppered volumetric flask. The flask was undisturbed for about 10 min or until all methanol wetted surfaces were dried. The flask was weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg at ambient temperatures; one or two drops of the pure liquid standards (benze ne, toluene, ehtylbenzene, and xylenes) were added to the flask using a 50 ilL syringe.

The flask was then reweighed and capped and the solution was mixed by inverting the flask several times (Kessels, 1992). The concentration of the BTEX standard in mg/L was calculated from the net gain in weight. These stock standards were transferred into a Teflon

sealed screw cap bottle with minimal headspace and stored in the refrigerator. The stock standards were used to prepare the standards for calibration by dilution with methanol and water. The standards were analyzed in the GC. From the GC results obtained, the area under the peak was plotted against the known concentration of BTEX used. The concentrations of the samples were obtained from the calibration curve (Figure 3.2). Triplicate samples were prepared and analyzed to demonstrate the reproducibility of this technique. The results fell within 5-10% standard error.

3.2.2. pH and Temperature Measurement
The measurement and control of pH and temperature are highly important in the water treatment systems. The most significant environmental impact of pH involves synergistic effects. Synergy is the process whereby two or more substances combine and produce effects greater than their sum. For example when acidic waters (low pH) come into contact with certain chemicals and metals, this often makes them more poisonous than normal. To exemplify this concept, fish that usually can withstand pH values as low as 4.8 will die at pH 5.5 if the water they are swimming in contains as little as 0.9 mglL of iron. Mixing acidic water with small amounts of aluminum, lead, or mercury, and one have a similar problem one that far exceeds the usual dangers of these substances (DCNR, 2010). The steps involved in wastewater treatment require specific pH levels. In order for coagulation (a treatment process) to occur, pH and alkalinity must fall within a limited range. Chlorination, a disinfecting process for drinking water, requires a pH range that is temperature dependent. The pH of water determines the solubility and biological availability of chemical constituents such as nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon) and heavy metals (lead. copper, cadmium, etc.) (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010). Furthermore, in

advance oxidation processes, measurements of pH can indicate that the reaction is moving
30

toward completion (for example, organic acid and carbon dioxide are produced and hence. the pH drops). The temperature and pH of the samples were measured by a portable pH and pH/ISE Meter (230A plus, Thermo Orion). Before use, this measuring device was calibrated using either pH 4.0 I and 7.00 or 7.00 and to.O I buffer solutions, depending on the expected sample range, at room temperature. During pH measurement, the temperature was displayed automatically at the same time. The measurements were done immediately at room temperature after collecting wastewater sample.

3.2.3. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Measurement
The YSI Dissolved Oxygen Meter model 58 equipped with an YSI 5739 BOD probe was used to measure the DO in the BOD bottles. The DO membrane and electrolyte were changed prior to the calibration and adjustment of the probe. The DO probe was adjusted before its use to obtain the DO readings that corresponded to the calibration values for the local altitude and temperature. The DO membrane was visually inspected (for wear, tear and/or presence of air bubbles) and replaced, if necessary.
3.2.4. Hydrogen Peroxide CHECKIT

The Lovibond Hydrogen Peroxide CHECKIT unit has three compartments, which functions as both a sample container and a comparator in a compact unit. The outer compartments are used for the analysis of low (0.2-2 mglL) and high (lO-lOO mgfL) concentrations ofH 2 0 zÂ· The middle compartment is used as a reference. It was filled with theÂ· water to be tested without addition of any reagent tablet in order to compensate for any inherent color or turbidity present in the sample. Three types of reagent tablets are part of this CHECKIT; LR (IO\\'er range), HR (high range), and acidifying tablet, which are used to detect the concentration of H20z in the sample.

Rl = 0.999 Rl = 0.999 RI= 0.999 RI= 0.992

32

To measure the concentration of H 2 0 2 , each compartment was filled to the ] 0 mL mark with the sample water. LR reagent tablet was added to the low range compartment and HR and the acidifying tablets were added to the high range compartment. The tablets were crushed with a clean stirring rod and the stopper was placed. The unit was inverted several times until the tablets were fully dissolved. Next, it was allowed to stand for 2 minutes. Then, CHECKIT was given a final shake and the colour produced was compared against the standards using daylight. The resulting sample colour was visually matched with the coloured plastic foils to indicate the concentration of the H 2 0 2 under test. For example, if the colour of sampled water is unchanged when the tablets were added to the sample water in the kit, the solution did not contain H 2 0 2 in the range of detection Â«0.2 mg/L). If the colour changes to pink, then the solution contains H 20 2 Â· For example. if the colour ofthe sample is dark orange. based on the nomenclature of the kit. the concentration of H202 of the sample is 100 mgIL. In contrast, if the colour of sample changes to light pink, the concentration is 0.2 mgIL

3.2.5. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
The biological oxygen demand (BOD) is a biochemical procedure for determining the uptake of dissolved oxygen by biological microorganisms in a sample of water. BOD tests were performed as per Standard Methods (APHA, 1998) for the examination of wastewater. The following four buffers were required for BOD analysis: phosphate buffer, magnesium sulfate, ferric chloride, and calcium chloride. These buffers were prepared by dissolving the required chemicals in distilled water, diluted to 1L. The chemicals required for each stock solution are as follows: Â· Phosphate buffer: 8.5 g KH2P04; 21.75 g K2HP04, 33.4 g NaHp 0 4.7H 20 and 1.7 g NH 4 Cl Â· Magnesium sulfate buffer: 22.5 g MgS04.7H20
33

Â· Â·

Ferric chloride: 0.25 g FeCL].6H 20 Calcium chloride: 27.5 g CaCL2 Dilution water for BOD was produced by aliquoting I mL of each of the above stock

buffer into I L of distilled water and saturated with DO by aeration. The diluted water must have a pH falUng between 6.5 and 7.5. The pH for unknown samples must be verified. If the pH of the sampled water is not within the range, the sample must be neutralized by I N sulfuric acid (H2S04) or I N sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The phosphate buffer has the abinty to bring the pH of the diluted sample between 6.5 and 7.5. The sample should not be diluted by more than 0.5 % of total volume of the BOD bottle of300 ml.

3.2.5.1. Standard Check Solution

Standard check solution was made of glucose-glumatic acid. Glucose (C 6H I2 0 6) and glutamic acid (C 5H9N0 4) were first dried for I h in an oven at I Q3Â°C and the solution was made by dissolving 150 g glucose and 150 g glutamic acid in distilled water, diluted to I L.

3.2.5.2. Seed Source

Polyseed, manufactured by InterLab, was the seed source for the BOD tests. Each capsule of Poly seed contains specialized microbial cultures ideal for use in a broad range of areas involving the degradation of industrial and municipal wastes. One capsule was added to 500 mL distilled water and was aerated for 30 minutes before BOD analysis. Different volumes of BTEX solutions were used in each test. The necessary volume of samples was added to the 300 mL BOD bottles. Four mL of aerated seed solution were added to each of the BOD bottle and then each BOD bottle was filled by slowly adding sufficient dilution water such that the stopper could be inserted without leaving an air bubble but not so much that it would overflow. Initial DO concentration was measured using the
34

dissolved oxygen meter (YSI 58 Dissolved Oxygen Meter, YSI Inc.) equipped with a BOD bottle probe (YSI 5750 Non-Stirring BOD Bottle Probe, YSI Inc.) As a reference test, two bottles were filled with dilution water and incubated with the rest of the bottles. In addition, four bottles with different seed volumes and dilution water were also incubated to determine the effect of Polyseed. Two bottles of glutamic acid and glucose with seed and dilution water were prepared for each batch of samples. This allowed for testing of the seed against a prepared standard. The samples were incubated in a C25K Classic series refrigerated incubator shaker (New Brunswick Co., Inc). Final DO was measured after 5 days of incubation for all BOD bottles and the blanks. BOD then was calculated using the following equation:

BOD = (D) -D2 )-SCF P

3.2.6. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
Chemical Oxygen Demand is defined as the amount of oxygen required to oxidize the organics in a solution by a strong oxidizing chemical under acidic condition. The unit of measure for COD normally is mg/L, which implies the oxygen uptake per litre of the

35

solution. The theoretical oxygen demand oxidizing an organic compound to carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia, can be calculated by the stoichiometry of oxidation (Petrucci and Harwood, 1997):

Where n, a, b, and c are the number of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atom, respectively per unit organic molecule. The chemical Equation (3.4) is balanced; the coefficient of O 2 determines the theoretical oxygen demand for the organic molecule. The COD can be determined by different methods. Given that the samples in this experiment had no suspended solids present and the predicted COD value was above 50 mg/L, the closed refluxed method was chosen, because it is economical (APHA, 1998). In the closed refluxed method, a mixture of potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid is used to oxidize the organic compounds. The oxidation of organic compounds by potassium dichromate under acidic condition is as follows:

The COD analysis was measured by the pre-packaged, mercury-free and premixed COD vials (Bioscience Inc.) based on Section 5220 of Standard Methods (APHA, 1998).

In the preparation of a 10 gCODIL of stock standard solution, potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) was pre-dried to a constant weight at 110Â°C. and 85034 g of it were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to I L. A series of working standard solutions, covering the expected range of sample concentrations (20-900 mgCODIL) were prepared by accurately diluting the 10 gCODIL of stock standard solution with distilled water. A standard calibration curve was prepared using potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP). At least five standard KHP solutions with COD equivalent to 5 - 150 mgCODIL were used, the same reagent volumes. tube and digestion procedures were used as for the samples. According to the requirements of the test method for using the COD vials (Bioscience, Inc.), blanks of the ranges 20-900 and 100-4,500 gCODIL were used to zero the spectrophotometer before sample testing. The highest standard (I50 mgILCOD) ofthe range 5-150 mgCODlL was used to zero the spectrophotometer (A = 440 and 600 nm were used for
37

low and high range, respectively}. The standard curve of the range 5-150 mgCODIL had a negative slope and the 150 mg/L standard would read a negative absorbance if using a blank for zeroing the spectrophotometer (the spectrophotometer cannot read negative absorbance). If the samples could not be tested within 5 h of collection, they were preserved with concentrated sulphuric acid, to a pH no greater than 2, and were refrigerated at 4Â°C until analysis. The MICRO-COD Test Method accu-Test TM Low Range (5-150 mglL COD) developed by Bioscience was used in this study, which is a colourimetric method of measuring COD. 2.5 mL of sample solution were added to the COD vial. The tubes were sealed and then thoroughly mixed by inverting them several times. The twist cap vials were heated in COD heater block (Bioscience Inc., preheated to 150Â±2Â°C) for 2 h. After 2 h, the vials were removed and allowed to cool down in a rack. The outsides of the vials were wiped to remove dust and then placed into the light path of the spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 1110 Pro, Biochrom Ltd.) to measure their COOs under a standard curve covering the expected range of sample concentrations. The software, SWIFT II 1000, installed in a computer connected to the spectrophotometer was used for COD analysis. A wavelength of 600 nm for COD range 100-4,500

gCOD/L was first set and the absorbance was zeroed by a blank. A standard curve for this COD
range was generated by selecting 'Run' and then 'Standards' to get the absorbance readings of a series of standards with known COD concentrations. Absorbance (optical density) is a measure of the amount of light absorbed by a solution. Absorbance is equal to the logarithm of the ratio of incident light to transmitted light. Each replicate of each standard was measured and stored, and the mean values were calculated. A standard curve (Figure 3.3) was then created using the mean absorbance values. The standard curve showed linearity between absorbance values and known standards concentrations, and was displayed in a graph view,
38

with the results of samples superimposed upon it. The measured absorbance was compared to the calibration curve and corresponding COD was reported in mgIL. An unknown COD concentration was measured by selecting 'Open" selecting 'Standards', and then selecting 'Run Samples'. The samples were only run after the standard curve was created. Each replicate of a sample was measured and compared to the standard curve. Each sample's result was displayed as it was collected. The calibration curve was checked every time a sample was measured. Eckenfelder (2000) states that there are some drawbacks to the COD method of detennining the contents of organic carbon in a sample: aromatics compounds and volatile straight-chain aliphatic compounds cannot be oxidized using the COD method. Therefore, using the COD method for these compounds would give a lower COD value than the actual theoretical oxygen demand. The percentage removal of COD can be calculated as foliows:

oxidized to C02 and H2 0. The quantity of carbon dioxide produced is measured by means of an infrared analyzer. In these experiments, the Apollo 9000 Total Organic Carbon (TOC) Analyzer was used, which utilizes combustion (680 to 1000Â°C) with a reusable platinum catalyst for the lowest detection limits while maximizing TOC recovery. Due to the presence of the catalyst, the organic matter is completely oxidized to C02 and H20. The non-dispersive infrared sensor (NDIR) quantifies the amount of C02 produced by the catal)1ic reaction in the TOC analyzer (Apollo 9000, 2003). Before sample analysis, the TOC analyzer was calibrated using standards prepared using potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) as an organic carbon source for TOC calibration. The KHP was dried in an oven (Binder-World) at 105Â°C for 2 h before the preparation of stock standard sol ution and stored in a desiccator. In the preparation of a 1,000 mglL of KHP stock standard solution, an accurate 2. t 25 mg of KHP was dissolved in distilJed water and was diluted to 1 L. A series of accurate dilutions were performed, using the stock solution of 1000 mgIL to obtain working standard solutions, covering the expected range of sample concentrations Le. 1-400 mg/L (Figure 3.4). Through running TOC standard calibration analysis, a TOC calibration curve for the range of 1-400 mgIL was obtained for analyzing TOC concentrations. A response factor correlates the raw counts of the instrument to a known amount of carbon in the standard. Both stock and working standard solutions were capped and stored in a 2 to SoC refrigerator. The percentage removal ofTOC can be calculated as follows:

3.3. Photochemical Treatment
Two experimental setups were used in this study: batch and continuous, as described in the following sections.

3.3.1. Batch PhotochemicaJ Setup
Figure 3.5 shows the photoreactor setup used in all batch photochemical experiments. The reactor in these experiments was a 300 mL glass Erlenmeyer. The working volume was 250 mL. A Philips UV lamp (PL-S 9W TUV) with wavelength of 254 nm was immersed in the reactor filled with the prepared synthetic BTEX wastewater. The reactor was wrapped by aluminum foil to prevent the transmission of UV light from the reactor. The vessel contained a magnetic stirring bar placed on a magnetically stirred plate to thoroughly mix the solution and to avoid any mass transfer limitation.
3.3.1.1. Batch Photochemical Experiments

A series of experiments were performed to determine whether a closed or open sy~1em should be used for the treatment of BTEX and to show the role of H2Ch in the degradation of BTEX using a UV-254 nm lamp in the batch reactor. A typical degradation experiment was performed in a 250 mL test solution containing BTEX in deionized water in the presence or absence of H202. The concentration of BTEX used was 90-300 mgCODIL. Samples were withdrawn periodically (every 20 min) by pipitting out 5-10 mL from the sample port and they were analysed for COD, BOD, and GC.

3.3.2. Continuous Photoreactor Setup
Figure 3.6 shows the experimental setup for all the continuous photochemical experiments. The feed reservoir had a volume of 4 L. The flow of the synthetic water to the UV photoreactor was adjusted with a valve located at the outlet of the feed reservoir. The feed reservoir was filled to capacity (4L) and during each run only 1.5 L was used to avoid any pressure head change. The UV reactor purchased from Siemens Company (SL-l S) had a total working volume of 1.35 L with an 8 cm external diameter and a 34 cm total length. The power of the UV lamp was 17 W with a 1 cm diameter and a 30 cm length. The quartz sleeve of the UV lamp was 2.5 cm in diameter and 34 cm long. Two wavelengths of UV light (254 and 185 nm) were used.

3.3.2.1. Continuous Pbotochemical Degradation Experiments
A number of experiments was performed to show the degradation andtor disappearance of BTEX under different conditions. A 4-L glass spherical container (feed
re~ervoir)

with a sampling port was used to prepare the BTEX solution. The container was

filled its capacity (4 L) with the deionized water placed on a magnetically stirred plate. 0.4632 mL of BTEX was injected into the glass feed reservoir. The solution was stirred with a Teflon-coated magnetic bar overnight to solubilize BTEX into the deionized water.

Prior to the start of photolytic experiment, a sample was taken for the TOC measurement. The required amount (0-350 mg/L) of 30% H20 2 was added to the BTEX water solution and stirred for 5 min to ensure that the solution was well mixed. Another sample was taken to measure the TOC. The feed reservoir outlet valve was adjusted to feed the BTEX solution into the 1.35 L UV reactor. The flow was adjusted such that the residence

time of solution in the UV reactor was in the range of 20 min to 6 h. These residence times were chosen to determine the time for the mineralization of BTEX. Literature values show that in batch, the degradation ofBTEX occurred in 10 min (Daifullah and Mohammed, 2004) and in a continuous flow, the solution was circulated for 4 h in the UV reactor (Cho et aI., 2006). The reaction time or the residence time was not exactly the same as the literature, because the setup and equipment were not the same. Daifullah and Mohammed's (2004) reactor had a power rating of 500W; while the power supplied by the sun to reactor used by Cho et aI., (2006) was 15 W. A timer was set from the time the first drop flowed to the UV reactor (marked as number 8 in the diagram) until the first drop was collected at location 10. The timer ensured that the residence time was indeed as set by the valve. Samples were collected from the UV outlet port and analyzed. The initial TOC of the BTEX used in each experiment was 100 Â± 10 mg/L, unless otherwise specified. Triplicate runs were performed for each residence time and analyzed using the TOC analyzer and BOD. Both COD and TOC give an indication of how much organic carbon is present in the
~ample. Since COD analysis takes approximately 3 h to attain results, COD was not used for

all experiments. The process of analyzing the sample with TOC is less time consuming than COD; TOC analysis takes approximately 20 minutes. In addition, H202 has COD as well. Since H202 was used in these experiments, it interfered with the true COD value of the BTEX. Experiments were performed on each individual compound in a similar manner. The temperature and pH were also monitored during each experiment. Each experiment was conducted in triplicates. The average results were reported and the value of standard error was calculated. A sample calculation of standard error is shown in Appendix B. To assess the biodegradability of BTEX, a series of BOD tests were performed on the BTEX solution and the UV treated BTEX solution. For the BOD test of BTEX, oxygen

47

consumption was measured. To measure biodegradability of a chemical its ratios of BOD/COD or BODffOC must be measured. A high ratio of BOD/COD and BODffOC would translate into high growth and activity of the microbial community. Therefore, if the BOD/COD and BODffOC value is high, one can conclude that the BTEX and its intermediates are biodegradable.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this chapter, the results obtained from photochemical degradation of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) using both batch and continuous photoreactors are presented. BTEX were degraded by UV-254 nm, UV-185 nm, and a combination ofUV and H20 2 to determine which one has the ability to degrade BTEX at a faster rate.

4.1. Photochemical Degradation of BTEX
4.1.1 Dark Reaction
A series of control experiments were conducted to quantify the loss of BTEX through volatilization. In the dark experiments, solutions of BTEX were used in the batch reactor without light and with no H2 0 2 for an hour to verify whether volatilization and! or deposition contributed to the loss of BTEX The results of these experiments are illustrated in Figures 4.1,4.2, and 4.3. In the dark experiments, solutions of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes were placed into an open batch system. The COD of each solution was measured at the beginning of the experiment and three samples were taken within an hour. Figure 4.1 illustrates that when these solutions were left open to the air with no UV- light and no each of the solution had decreased with time.

Neither UV lamp nor HzOz were used.

At 20 min, 2.9%-4.1 % COD of each of the solution had evaporated. After an hour in the open system, 10-15% COD of the BTEX had escaped from the solution. Figure 4.2 illustrates that when the solution was stirred in an open batch system with no light and no H20 2, the rate of disappearance of COD of BTEX increased by 76-85%. After
20 min of stirring in the open system, the COD concentration dropped by 32.5-45% for each

of the solutions. After an hour of stirring, 65- ) 00% of COD of BTEX disappeared. Toluene was entirely volatilized out of the solution within an hour of stirring in an open system, while
65% of benzene volatilized. The results of these experiments demonstrated that a closed

reactor system was required to avoid the loss of BTEX due to volatilization. The purpose of these experiments was to show the requirement of a closed system for the degradation of BTEX. A solution of BTEX was stirred, for an hour, in the batch photoreactor (closed system) with the UV light off and with no H2~. The results of the closed dark reaction are illustrated in Figure 4.3. It was observed that there was a 0.5% (2.5 mgCODIL) change in the COD concentration of BTEX. Comparing a 0.5% loss of COD in a closed batch system to a
65 -100% loss of COD in open batch system, it was concluded that a closed system would

avoid the changes in concentration of BTEX due to evaporation. Therefore, a closed reactor system was used as depicted in Figure 3.5 for the photodegradation ofBTEX. A series of dark reactions were conducted with the BTEX solutions in the continuous flow photoreactor to detennine the evaporation of BTEX in the continuous setup. The results of these experiments are illustrated in Figure 4.4. Each bar represents an experiment. It was observed that the change in the TOC concentration increased with an increase in the residence time.

Experiments with longer residence time (Le. 6 h) demonstrated changes in the TOe concentration in the range of 3.2-5%.; while experiments with residence time of I h showed changes in the TOe concentration in the range of 0.9-1.1%. Therefore, there was no significant degradation of BTEX in the absence of UV light.

4.1.2. Photoreaction of BTEX
In order to determine whether photolysis contributed to the degradation of BTEX, DTEX solutions were exposed to UV light in both batch and continuous reactor without any

(h02.
The average COD, TOe or concentration of BTEX values of triplicate experiments were calculated and graphed. In addition, the standard error for each data point was. calculated. Refer to standard error calculation in Appendix B. The standard error for all data was less than 5%, with the exception of the BOD test results, for which the standard error was as high as 9.9% (see data points at \0 min in Figure 4.10, 40 min and 120 min in Figure 4.23). In the closed stirred batch system, DTEX solutions were irradiated by UV-254 nm for a period of 3 h. As illustrated in Figure 4.5, the COD removal (%) increased with an increase in the treatment time. For example, the COD removal of the solution within the first hour of reaction was 14.8%. After 3 h oftreatment time, it was 26.8%.

Different concentrations of BTEX [mgTOC/L] were irradiated by UV-254 with TOeIH20 2

BTEX increased (refer to Table 4.1).

In the continuous photoreactor, the BTEX solutions were exposed to UV -185 and

UVÂ·254 nm with no H20 2 for a period of 4 h. As exemplified in Figure 4.6, the degradation
of BTEX with UV-185 nm was higher than that of UV-254 nm, because water has aÂ· continuous UV adsorption spectrum between 175 and 190 nm and in this wavelength range, a direct decomposition of water is the source of hydroxyl radicals (Reaction 4.1) (Chen et at,

2002; Wang and Ray, 2000; MiIlipore, 2000) which can then attack the BTEX compounds
thus degrading them. In addition, UV-185 carries more energy than the longer UV-254 wavelength. UV-185 not only breaks organic bonds, but also generates chemical species called free radicals (Byron, 2000). When the residence time was 1 h, the removal ofBTEX with UVÂ·254 nm was 0.3%.

UV -185 nm had a TOC rem ova] of 6.94%. The removal for both wavelengths increased with
an increase in the residence time. \Vhen the residence time was 4 h, the removal of TOC by

UV -254 nm and UV -185 nm was 8.6% and 12%, respectively.

to the initial supply of hydroxy I radical, which as mentioned above, UV-185 is able to break water molecules into hydroxyl radical (Chen et aI., 2002; Wang and Ray, 2000; Millipore, 2000). Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference in removal ofBTEX by UV-185 and UV -254 nm decreased with time.

4.1.3. Effects of Hydrogen Peroxide on the Degradation of BTEX
The effect of
H2~

alone in the absence of UV light on the BTEX solution in the

photoreactor was tested by taking samples from the reactor every 20 min for 3 h to measure the COD of the solution. In a closed system with BTEX concentration of 100 mgCODIL, a 300 mglL of H20 2 sample was added and the reactor was continuously stirred. The results of this experimental run are illustrated in Figure 4.7. The COD concentration decreased with an increase in time. This dark experiment was conducted on a mixture of BTEXlH20 2 showing a 15.3% COD concentration change within 3 h. The results show that the mineralization of BTEX by
H2~

was a slow process. As

exhibited in Section 4.1.2, the photolysis of BTEX without an oxidizing agent was also a slow process. Therefore, UV was combined with H202 to speed up the degradation process of BTEX, as described next.

4.1.4. Combination ofUV and H 20 2
The photodegradation of BTEX, with the aim to investigate the effect of oxidant (H 20 2), was conducted. H202 in combination with UV -254 was used in the batch setup. The resu Its demonstrated that the addition of oxidants enhanced the removal of BTEX. As shown in Figure 4.8, more than 90% of BTEX was degraded within 40 min irradiation under UV254 nm. The COD value also decreased. After 105 min irradiation, BTEX was not detected in the solution, but the COD had not reached to zero. In a complete mineralization ofBTEX, the

COD value should have decreased to zero. As illustrated in Figure 4.8, the COD removal at the end of the stirred batch experiment with UVÂ·254 nm and H20 2 was 22.5%. This COD removal value is not 100% due to the incomplete mineralization ofthe BTEX but also it demonstrates the interference of
H202 with the COD measurement (Kang et al .Â· 1998). In addition, the theoretical COD of 43

mglL of BTEX in the mass ratio of 11 :26: 11 :52 is 122 mgIL, while the experimental value measured was 148.8 mgIL. This difference in the theoretical and experimental COD values clearly demonstrated the interference of H20 2Â· When hydrogen peroxide is added to potassium dichromate acidified by sulfuric acid. the colour of the solution turns green. This is due to the formation of Crt ions from the reduction of potassium dichromate (Reaction 4.2). Also due to its reductive ability. H202 is able to reduce potassium dichromate and thus interferes with the COD analysis (Kang et at. 1998): (4.2) Kang et al. (1998) analyzed their experimental values by the least square method using a second order linear equation. producing the following equation:

(4.3)

Where
[H2~] = the concentration ofhydrogen peroxide in mg/L

The interference of H20 2 with the COD values were calculated and are presented in Appendix D. There was a 16.1 % difference between the theoretical COD of BTEX and the measured COD subtracted the H202 interference. Even though hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent, it acts as a

reducing agent when reacting with stronger oxidizing agents such as chlorine, potassium pennanganate, and potassium dichromate (Kang et aI., 1999). Figure 4.9 demonstrates that H202 was reduced by dichromate ion in acidic conditions under the irradiation ofUV-254 nm. Therefore, H202 would interfere with the COD measurement of any organic compound. Due to H20 2 interference with the COD value of BTEX, the use of COD analysis in this project was limited. The rest of the experiments were analyzed using TOe and BOD.

4.1.4. Recommended Value of H 20 2 for the Degradation ofBTEX
Considering the fact that the slow rate (10-25% removal in 3 h) of degradation of BTEX with H20 2, UV alone, and the photoactivity of H2(h at 185-400 nm, it can be concluded that the degradation process must occur by direct photolysis ofH20 2. In this section, several experiments were performed using different H 20 2 concentrations with 100 mg/L TOe of BTEX to determine the optimal concentration of H202 for the degradation of BTEX. In order to accelerate the degradation of BTEX, sufficient amounts
0

f H 20 2 are

required to absorb UV light and generate enough hydroxyl radicals. Different concentrations of H202 were added to 100 mgIL TOC ofBTEX under the irradiation of UV-254 nm in the batch reactor. In addition, different concentrations of H20 2 were added to the continuous reactor under the irradiation of UV-185 and UV-254 nm to determine its effect on the degradation of BTEX. It was determined that an increase in the concentration of H20 2 in the reactor led to an increase in the TOe removal of BTEX. As shown in Figure 4.10, it was observed that the rate of removal of BTEX was increased by increasing the H20 2 concentration in the batch reactor with UV-254 nm irradiation. For example, after an hour of treatment with UV-254 nm, the difference in removal of BTEX between the batch reactor

Fignre 4.10: The effect of addition of H 20 1 on the degradation of 100 mgTOCIL of BTEX in a batch reactor onder UV-2S4 nm.

with no H202 and the batch reactor with 100 mg/L H2~ was 16%.

To illustrate the optimal concentration of H20 2for the removal of BTEX with UV-254 nm irradiation, and H202 in the batch reactor, the TOC removal of BTEX was plotted against the concentration of H20 2 used. Figure 4.11 demonstrates that the optimal H202 concentration to degrade 100 mgTOCIL ofBTEX was 300 mglL.

As shown in Figure 4.12, the difference between the removal of 100 mgTOCIL of BTEX by 0 mg/L and 100 mglL of H202 after an hour irradiation under UV-185 was 23.3%. The TOC removal (%) ofBTEX for the same residence time was increased by increasing the concentration of H202 until the H20 2 concentration was 250 mgIL. With 300 mglL of H20 2, the TOC removal (%) was decreased (0.5-8% TOC removal) at all residence times and with 350 mglL H20 2, the TOC removal (%) was decreased even further (1.1-16.9% TOC removal) . The removal of BTEX at 250 mg/L of H202 for 1 and 4 h of residence was 36.6% and 68.8%, respectively.

On the other hand, at I and 4 h residence time, the TOC removal (%) with 300 mgIL of H20 2 was 37.1 % and 52.6 %, respectively. Considering the results of these experiments, it was concluded that under the irradiation of UV-185 nm at any residence time, the maximum percentage removal (of 100 mglDCIL of BTEX) occurred at 250 mglL ofH2 0 2. To illustrate the optimal concentration of H202 with UV-185 for the degradation of 100 mgTOCIL of BTEX, the TOC removal (%) was graphed against the ratio ofH202 and TOC (Figure 4.13).

Similar to the irradiation of UV-185 nm, the TOC removal (%) of BTEX increased with an increase in H202 concentration under the irradiation of UV-254 nm in the continuous flow photoreactor (Figure 4.14). The difference in the TOC removal (%) of 100 mgTOCfL of BTEX by 0 mg/L and 100 mgfL of H 20 2 at any residence time was 24-28%. The TOC removal (%) of BTEX for the same residence time increased with an increase in the concentration of H20 2 until H20 2 concentration was 300 mgfL. At 350 mglL of H 20 2, the percentage removal decreased (19-23%) at all residence times compared to the percentage removal with 300 mglL of H20 2Â· The TOC removal (%) of BTEX at 300 mglL of H 20 2 for 1 and 4 h residence time was 51.2% and 59.9%, respectively. Alternatively, at 1 and 4 h residence time, the percentage removal with 350 mgfL of H20 2 was 36.2% and 38.4 %, respectively. Considering the results of these experiments, it was concluded that under the irradiation of UV-254 nm at any residence time, the maximum percentage removal of 100 mgTOC/L ofBTEX occurred with 300 mgfL ofH 202.

It was observed that when lower concentration of H 20 2 was used, the percentage
. removal of BTEX TOC was low. The low percentage removal ofTOC was due to the smaller fraction of adsorbed incident light, leading to a decrease in the rate of formation of 'OH radicals. Increasing the concentration of H2~ beyond the optimum had a negative impact (decreasing the TOC percentage removal by 28.9% in batch). This negative impact is due to the extra H 20 2 that competed with BTEX for hydroxyl radical and acting as scavenger for the hydroxyl radical as described by the following reaction (Buxton et aI., 1988):

For comparison purposes, the results of the experiments for the optimum H202 for UV-185and UV-254 nm were plotted in Figure 4.15. The results in these experiments showed that the percentage removal of TOC by UV-185/l-h02 increased with time (by 32% TOC removal comparing I h to 4 h of residence time). On the other hand, the TOC removal of UV254/ H20 2 did not increase at the same rate as for UV-185 (comparing the 1 h to 4 h of residence, the removal increase was 8.8%). The experimental optimum value for the degradation of 100 mgIL TOC of BTEX by UV-254 was 300 mgfL H20 2Â· The theoretical oxygen demand of 100 mgTOCIL of BTEX is 286 mg/L, which demonstrates the accuracy of the experimental optimal value obtained. The difference between the theoretical oxygen demand and the experimental is 4.7%. The experimental optimum value for the degradation of BTEX by UV-185 nm was 250 mg/L. which was off by 12.6% from the theoretical value. This optimum value is lower because UV -185 nm has the energy to break the covalent bond of water decom posing it into hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, it is concluded that the remainder of hydroxyl radicals were supplied by the breakdown of water with UV-185 nm. For comparison purposes, the results of TOC removal by UV-254 in a batch reactor and continuous flow reactor with 300 mg of H20 1 are plotted in Figure 4.16. It can be observed that the degradation of BTEX by the flow reactor is higher than in the batch reactor, th is is due to two reasons. The flow reactor is made of electro polished 316L stainless steel, which was designed for the efficient transfer of radiation into water. On the other hand the batch reactor was glass wrapped with aluminum foil, which as demonstrated was not as effective as reactor made out of stainless steel. The other reason for the higher removal of TOC by the continuous flow reactor, the power of the lamp was 17 watts while the lamp used for batch reactor was 9 W. A suitable comparison can be performed ifboth batch and

4.1.5. Acidic, basic, and unadjusted pH
The pH was monitored for all experiments. By increasing the residence time, the pH of the samples decreased. The pH value ofBTEX solutions was dropped to 3.0-3.3 under the irradiation of UV-254 (Figure 4.17) in both the batch and continuous flow photoreactor. Considering that the solution becomes acidic (pH:::::3), experiments were perfonned to evaluate the effect of inlet pH on the removal of BTEX. The pH becomes acidic, due to the formation of carbon dioxide, which dissolves in water producing carbonic acid (H 2 C03) (Crittenden et aI., 1999). Once the recommended concentration of H20 z was determined, a series of experiments were performed under: acidic conditions pH 3, basic pH 11.5 and unadjusted pH. With hydrogen peroxide at its recommended concentration of 300 mgJL and 250 mgfL for UV-254 nm and UV-185 nm, respectively, the TOC removal was higher by 15-25% under the acidic condition compared to basic and unadjusted pH (Figure 4.18 and Figure 4.19). With the inlet adjusted pH of 3, UV-185 nm with 250 mgfL H20 Z had 14.8% TOC removed more than by UV-254 nm with 300 mglL H20 z in the continuous flow photoreactor at 3 h

residence. By lowering the pH of the solution to 3, the production of hydroxyl radical is optimized (DaifuJlah and Mohamed, 2004). In addition, the dissociated fonn of hydrogen peroxide (HO z'), in alkaline solution reacts with hydroxyl radicals more than two orders of magnitude faster than hydrogen hydroxyl radicals, refer to Reaction 2.15 and 2.16. The reaction rate constant for the HOi with hydroxyl is higher (7.5 x 10 1-.f'sÂ·l) compared to the

The discharge of industrial wastewater to the environment must have a pH falling in the range of 6-9 (Correctional Service Canada, 2003). In addition, high pH causes corrosion and safety problems. In the event if UV IH202 is used as a treatment method, prior to discharge of treated water, it has to be neutralized in order to be complaint with regulations and to protect the environment.

4.1.7. Experiments with Acidic pH and Optimal H 20 2
A series of experiments were performed under acidic conditions (pH 3) and with the recommended
H202

concentrations (300 mg/L with UV-254 nm and 250 mg/L with UV-185

nm). It was observed that after 6 h irradiation under UV-185 nm, 91.5% TOC was removed from the solution, while with UV-254 78.1 % TOC was removed. This illustrated that for TOC percentage removal, UV-185 nm performed 14.6% better than UV-254 nm under their respective optimal conditions (Figure 4.20).

'4.1.8. Use ofUV-185 nm and UV-254 nm in Series
Experiments were performed to see the effect ofUV-lights in series. 100 mgTOC/L of BTEX solutions were prepared and 300 mglL of H20 2 was added to the solutions (acidic condition, pH ;:::: 3). The BTEX solution was fed to the UV-185 nm, such that the residence time was 1 h. The same procedure was repeated, except the residence time in UV-254 nm photoreactor was increased by increments of 1 h. A total of 4 experiments were performed with the initial residence time of 1 h in the photoreactor with UV-185 nm followed with 1,2, 3 and 4 h of residence in the photoreactor with UV-254 nm. The results are plotted in Figure

Similar experiments were performed in the photo reactor with UV-254 nm followed by the photoreactor with UV-185 nm. The results are shown in Figure 4.21. It was observed that after 4 h irradiation in either of the arrangements, the TOC percentage removal was the same, 47% was removed. However, at 2 h irradiation, the TOC percentage removal by UV-254 followed by UV-185 is 2-5% higher than UV-185 nm followed by UV-254 nm. In Figure 4.22, the results ofUV-lights in series and UV-Iights alone are shown. It was observed that the use of light in series did not improve the TOC removal of BTEX. The TOC removal efficiency was as follows: UV-185 > UV-254 > UV-Iights in series.

4.2. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
The BOD ofBTEX, under the irradiation ofUV-254 nm in a batch stirred reactor was measured. The ratio of BODICOD indicates whether a chemical is readily biodegradable or not. If BODICOD is less than 0.3, then the solution is not readily biodegradable. As illustrated in Figure 4.23 b, the BODICOD ratio is 0.34 initially, but it was decreased (from 0.34 to 0.24) with an increase in the irradiation time. The BODICOD ratio was 0.24 after 140 min irradiation. Due to the interference of H202 with the COD value of the BTEX, no conclusion can be drawn from the BODICOD ratio.

The BOD analysis was performed on the BTEX solutions, under the irradiation of UV-254 nm and UV-185 nm. As illustrated in Figure 4.24, the BOD decreased (from 57 mglL to 30 mgIL) as residence time in the photoreactor increased (0-140 min). For example, the inlet BOD of solution ofBTEX (100 mgTOCIL) was 57 mgIL. After 2 h irradiation, the BOD was 26 mglL. The pattern for water treated with UV-185 nm and UV-254 nm was similar. In Figure 4.25, the BODITOC results show that biodegradability of BTEX treated with UV-254 and UV-185 is not enhanced. The BODITOC ratio for UV-254 decreased by 32% and for UV-

185 it decreased by 21% after 2 h irradiation. Based on BOOrrOC ratio, it is concluded that biodegradability ofBTEX under the irradiation ofUV-185 and UV-254 is not enhanced.

4.3. Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR) Experiments
Biodegradation experiments were performed using anaerobic barned reactor, which was acclimated to slaughter house waste water from a previous study. BTEX (10 mgIL) was introduced to the ABR with slaughter house waste water. For over a month, the sludge was fed with 10 mg/L of BTEX and slaughter house waste. The initial concentration of slaughter house waste was 900 mgTOC/L. Gradually, the concentration of slaughter house waste was reduced to 0 mgTOC/L. The concentration of BTEX was kept at 10 mgIL. The flow rate was adjusted to 0.63 Lih (the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 2.2 days). During the experiments, sludge washout was observed. There was occurrence of sludge bulking (usually occurs when the sludge fails to separate out from the wastewater). The data for volatile suspended solid (Figure 4.26) demonstrated the bulking of sludge. The TOC in the different compartments during the acclimation period was measured and are plotted in Figure 4.27. The sludge was settling as the concentration of slaughter house was decreased. This could have been due two factors, the hazardous nature of BTEX affecting the health of the sludge, and also due to less TOC available for consumption. The sludge did not seem healthy and the samples collected were bulking. Based on the data obtained, one cannot conclude the performance of ABR for BTEX, therefore the experiment was stop.

CHAPTERS CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following conclusions were drawn from this thesis:

5.1. Conclusions
1. The UVII-h02 contributed to the degradation of BTEX; however, this process was
slow. Under the irradiation of UV-254 nm in the batch photoreactor, the change in eOD of BTEX was 27%, while the change in Toe was less than 10% i n the continuous photoreactor. 2. The recommended concentration of H20 2 to degrade 100 mgTOelL of BTEX is 300 mg/L under the irradiation ofUV-254 nm. 3. The experimental results demonstrated that maximum removal (68%) of BTEX TOe occurred with 250 mgiL of H202 under the irradiation UV -185 in continuous flow photoreactor at flow rate of 0.45 Lih (3 h residence time). 4. The continuous flow photodegradation of BTEX were perfonned in three pH conditions; it was observed that the Toe percentage removal was the highest with pH 3.With the recommended quantity of H202 (300 mgiL and 250 mg/L) and acidic pH. the maximum mineralization was 80% and 90% for UVÂ·254 and UV-185 nm, respectively. However, the [ower pH may cause discharge environmental issues. The

90

discharge of industrial wastewater to the environment must have a pH in the range of 6-9, 5. During the batch UV-H 202. the concentration of BTEX was zero after 90 min irradiation under UV-254. however the eOD was 116 mg/L. This eOD value leads to conclude that the BTEX have been transfonned into its intennediates. 6. Using UV-185 and UV-254 nm in series did not improve the TOe removal, after 4 h of exposure; its TOe removal was 47%; white the TOe removal by UV -185 and UV254 alone were 68% and 60%, respectively. 7. The photochemical degradation of BTEX produced intennediates, which did not improve its biodegradability. The BOD of BTEX decreased as the irradiation time increased. In addition the BODITOC ratio of BTEX under the irradiation of UV -185 and UV-254 and optimum quantity of HzO" decreased by 21 % and 32%, respectively.

5.2. Recommendations
I. Due to the volatile nature of BTEX, further experiments should be perfonned to investigate the effect of volatility on the photodegradation results ofBTEX. 2. Water from nature that is contaminated with gasoline that has other chemicals present in it, therefore the interference of other chemicals on the degradation of BTEX should be taken into account in future studies. 3. Further studies should be perfonned to identify the by-products that are produced during the photodegradation ofBTEX. 4. Kinetics studies should be perfonned for UV-1851H202 to demonstrate the pseudo first order reaction. 5. Further studies should be perfonned under the entire pH range. In addition, cost optimization may be considered when treating the waste under extreme acidic Dr basic

91

conditions (not within the discharge limits: pH 6 -9). Neutralizing waste prior to discharge would be an additional cost. 6. Photo degradation experiments may be perfonned on post biodegradation of BTEX contaminated water. 7. Actual petroleum contaminated wastewater, from contaminated site or from a spillage site, could be used in the UV/H 20 2 process to evaluate its experimental findings and the possibility of application in practice. The contaminated water from site would have sludge and particulates, which will reduce the intensity of light. To avoid reducing intensity of light, filtering of water may be perfonned.

A. Determination of BOD
The BOD of samples was calculated using the following equation:

(3.3) (3.4)
For example, for the determination of the initial BODs of BTEX, each of 300 ml BOD bottle contained 20 mL initial wastewater (P=20J300), and the volume of seed solution used in glucose, glutamic acid (GGA) test was 4 mL. The volume of the seed solution used in seed control was J 0, J 5, 20 mL, respectively. The average initial BOD 5 was measured to be 57.02 mg/L. The calculation of SCF was shown in Table A.I. All details for BOD test are in Section 3.2.6.

The average inlet BODs ofBTEX (100 mgTOe/L) was determined to be 57.02 mg/L.

B. Standard Error Calculation The standard error of the mean was used as the error bar in this study. It is defined as the standard deviation divided by the square root of number of samples as follows (Skoog et al., 1998)

Standard Error

(B.I)

Where s = the standard deviation N = the number of samples

Sample standard deviation is used to analyze the accuracy of an experimental measurement for a finite set of experimental data. Sample mean (x) and sample standard deviation (s) are determined as follows (Skoog et al., 1998),

sample value

Between + I and - t standard error is the range in which there is a 68% probability that the true mean value was measured. For a stronger probability, the limits were extended to +2 and
-2 times the standard error and, therefore, provided 95% confidence.

Excel files were programmed to calculate the standard deviation and the standard error. For example, in Figure 4.6, the error bar for UV-185 nm at 180 min was calculated to he
3.17.

Table B.l lists the experimental data and calculated data for degradation of BTEX in continuous flow photo reactor with no hydrogen peroxide under the irradiation of UV-185 nm.

C. Percentage RemovaL! RemovaJ Efficiency

The percentage removal (removal efficiency) of eOD and TOe can be was calculated using equations 3.7 and 3.8, respectively. As a sample calculation, the TOe removal is shown using Equation 3.8 as follows:

TOC, , TOC% = ~. -~---=--; x 100% TOC; )

(3.8)

Where TOCi=the initial or inlel concentralion

TOCr = the final concentralion.

For example, the TOe percentage removal of BTEX in continuous flow photoreactor with no hydrogen peroxide under the irradiation ofUV-185 nm after J80 min was (see Table 8.1 for inlet and tinal values)

Removal(%)= 99.8-89.09 xIOO%= 10.73%

D. H 20: Calculations

The initial COD for hydrogen peroxide can be calculated using Equation (4.3) as follows: (4.3)

The hydrogen peroxide values were measured prior to the BOD test The results for the

102

experiment with 43 mgIL BTEX (with theoretical COD of 122 mglL) in the batch setup with UV-254
11m

are tabulated below (Table 0.1). The concentration ofH 20 2 added to the solution

was J 00 mglL. Equation 4.3 was used to calculate the COD of H20 2 as follows:

Given that the hydrogen peroxide Lovibond CHECKIT gives a range for the concentration of H20 2 therefore the corresponding calculated COD value is also a range. Given that the theoretical COD of BTEX was 122 mg/L and the measured COD was 148.81 mg/L, the higher value indicates the interference of H20 2Â· According to Kang et al., (1998), the calculated value of H2 02 must be subtracted from the measured COD value to eliminate the
103

interference of I-h02. Hence the corrected initial COD value of BTEX in the solution based on Kal1g et a1., (1998) would be 102.414, which is off by 16.1 % from the theoretical value of 122.
