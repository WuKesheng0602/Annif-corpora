ABSTRACT
DENITRICATION AND N 20 PRODUCTION IN CANADIAN LAKES: EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT RATIOS ACTING THROUGH PRIMARY PRODUCER SELECTION

Joseph Bautista Master of Science Molecular Science January, 2009 Ryerson University

Anthropogenic nutrient loading to aquatic systems may increase atmospheric release of nitrous oxide (N20) greenhouse gas by enhancing denitrification andlor nitrification. High Si:N loading may favour diatom abundance, whereas low N:P loading may favour cyanobacteria dominance. Systems with diatom or green algal dominance may have greater export of organic matter to sediments, whereas systems dominated by cyanobacteria may have organic matter recycled within the water column due to differences in cell density and sinking. With increased export of organic matter to sediments, denitrification and N20 production may be stimulated. In laboratory benchscale microcosms, nitrous oxide production was affected by Si:N loading ratios as predicted, although N:P loading did not affect N20 production in the manner predicted. However, the predicted effects of nutrient loading ratio on microphyte community composition were not supported by microscopy. Field mesocosm experiments indicated no significant relationship between N 20 production and nutrient loading ratios.

1. INTRODUCTION
Worldwide biogeochemical nitrogen cycling in aquatic environments is characterized as the maintenance of small scale nitrogen conversions over global sediment fields. Open to atmospheric and terrestrial nitrogen pools, the N-cycle in aquatic systems is dynamic as N-deposition and agricultural run-off affect loading and sediment nitrogen-processing rates. Sinks in the N-cycle, principally denitrification, may create a nitrogen deficit situation allowing nitrogen to become an important limiting nutrient in some aquatic ecosystems (Howarth & Marino, 2006). Human activities in watersheds may increase loading of other nutrients (e.g. phosphorus, silica, potassium) to aquatic systems. The nature of the activity may influence the nutrient loading ratios to aquatic systems. In response to changes in nutrient ratios, the primary producer community composition may change as low N:P, for example, may favour cyanobacteria (Bulgakov & Levich, 1999) while high N:Si favours diatoms (Anderson, 2000). Shifts in community composition could impact denitrification in the sediment layer if organic carbon becomes redistributed and recycled near the sediment layer (due to algal growth, e.g. diatoms, or sinking algae) as opposed to organic carbon being recycled in the water column. If more organic matter is deposited on the sediment, organic matter remineralization in sediments will increase while remineralization in the water column will decrease. In turn, this should increase benthic nitrification of mineralized N, and denitrification coupled to nitrification. It may also increase the production of N20 as a by-product of nitrogen cycling processes (nitrification and denitrification). Nitrous oxide is an important greenhouse gas and nitrogen cycling in aquatic systems has potential to contribute significantly to global climate change. Enhancement of nitrous oxide production due to shifts in nutrient loading
2

ratios could be an important outcome of human activities in watersheds that has not been considered previously. This study will develop an understanding of Si:N and P:N loading effects on seasonal microbial community diversity and their contribution to deposition and accumulation of sediment organic matter, remineralization of organic matter, and the production of N 20 and N2, representing the permanent N removal from an aquatic system. Analysis of the conditions for nitrous oxide production becomes the main focus in this research for future applied greenhouse gas management (Aelion & Shaw, 2000).

1.1 Nitrogen Cycling
Nitrogen (N) is an important component in fertilizers to increase crop yield and a constituent of fossil fuels, released during combustion as nitrogen oxides (NOx). The ability of nitrogen to exist in many different oxidation states makes it a reactive element. Many microorganisms exploit the reactivity of nitrogen as an electron donor or acceptor in their metabolism, and microorganisms are responsible for most N transformations in the global nitrogen cycle within the biosphere. These key transformations include nitrogen fixation, ammonia assimilation, assimilatory nitrate reduction, and ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification (Figure 1-1). Under N-limiting conditions, nitrogen fixation transforms atmospheric nitrogen (Le. N2) into biologically available nitrogen (Le. NH3, NH/) via enzyme-catalyzed reduction. As a result, nitrogen may be incorporated into biomass. The reciprocal process where NH3 and NH4+ are generated through the breakdown of organic nitrogen (N-remineralization) is known as ammonification. An alternative NHJlNH/ fate, nitrification, results from the oxidation of these compounds into N0 2- and N03-. Nitrification is an aerobic process. Denitrification

3

transfonns nitrate through several reduction steps into a final gaseous product of N20 (partial reduction) or N2 (complete reduction). Denitrification is a process in which the oxidized nitrogen fonn is used as a terminal electron acceptor when oxygen is absent or present at very low concentrations.

1.1.1 Atmospheric Nitrogen Cycle Overview
Global nitrogen is predominantly N2. constituting 78% of the atmospheric gases, where N20 makes up 99% of the remaining atmospheric N-compounds. Nitrous oxide accounts for about 0.0003% of the total atmospheric gases (Machefert, et. al., 2002) or 318 ppb (global average) in 2004 (Hall et. ai., 2007). The remaining environmental N-gases include nitrogen oxides, and ammonia. Dinitrogen gas is derived from a complete nitrate reduction by microbial denitrification. Partial denitrification contributes nitrous oxide and nitrogen oxides to the troposphere which contains 0.6 Tg N as reactive nitrogen oxides (Le. NOx, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and HN03) (Logan, 1985). The majority of nitrogen oxides (NOx) within this region react photochemically with oxidants (i.e. H02, R02 , and OH) to form HN03 within 1 to 30 days. The ability of HN03 to exist as an aerosol or cloud moisture (liquid state at 47.6 torr and 20°C) allows this compound to be a persistent pollutant. Anthropogenic acid deposition results from sulphur and nitrogen oxide mixing with precipitation. Nitrogen oxides playa larger role in acid rain formation since they increase at a greater rate than sulphur oxides due to natural and industrial activities (Logan, 1985), The largest ammonia contributor is supplied by ammonification and volatilization from animal excreta (Freney et. at., 1983). As a result nitrate salt (Le. NH4N03) is produced, when nitric acid reacts with ammonia base: NH3(g) + HN03(g or aq) -7 N~03 (8 or aq) The majority of ammonia gas (NH3) is cycled back to the biosphere in precipitation, or dry deposition. In transitional gas conditions, these reactants would be involved in cloud condensation or neutralizing acidic aerosols (Lawson, 1988).

1.1.2 Soil Nitrogen Cycle Overview
In terrestrial systems nitrogen is frequently a limiting nutrient because most organisms cannot use elemental atmospheric nitrogen and mineralized nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by denitrification. Atmospheric nitrogen is incorporated into the soil by means of nitrogen fixation, including biological nitrogen fixation and abiotic (e.g. lightning) fixation. In natural soils, atmospheric nitrogen fixation and denitrification are roughly in balance. However, human activities can unbalance these processes, increasing N input relative to denitrification. Anthropogenic nitrogen fixation may be accomplished by the Haber-Bosch process to produce fertilizer (Howard & Rees, 1996) for agricultural application. Fossil fuel and biomass combustion release NOx indirectly which may be returned to soils in wet and dry deposition, and biological agricultural practises (e.g nitrogen soil recovery from clover and soybean field planting) can increase biological nitrogen fixation (Galloway et. al., 1995; Smil, 1997). Leguminous plant roots are a main participant in the latter process by integrating atmospheric nitrogen into soil matrices via symbiotic Rhizaobium bacteria. These anaerobic diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) microbes commonly utilize nitrogenase enzyme as an integral part of this process. Nitrogenase consists of a Mo-Fe complex that binds nitrogen gas to the enzyme where it undergoes electron reduction in the Fe site (Igarashi & Seefeldt, 2003; Masukawa et. al., 2007; Rees
& Howard, 2000). The resultant free ion NHYNH4+ forms are unstable in aerobic

conditions and will immediately be incorporated in organism biomass (Delwiche, 1981). Along with nitrogen fixation, reduced nitrogen is also supplied to the system by dead organic soil matter through ammonification via heterotrophic bacteria. Nitrate is the most prevalent free ionic nitrogen form in oxic soil because 1) ammonium is assimilated

6

preferentially and 2) nitrifiers rapidly convert available ammonium (i.e. that not assimilated) to nitrate. Although nitrate may be incorporated in microbial soil biomass, it may also be involved in the denitrification process where it serves as a terminal electron acceptor to produce NOx intermediate products (Delwiche, 1981). These NOx products may be cycled back into soils by microbes, lighting and forest fires (Galloway et. ai., 1995). Human activities (e.g. fertilization, combustion of fossil fuels, and cultivation of legumes) combine to increase N loading to soils (Galloway et. al., 1995; Vitousek et. at., 1997). When denitrification fails to increase in proportion, excess nitrogen may be exported from soils to ground water and surface water, increasing N loading to these environments (Galloway et. ai., 1995).

1.1.3 Aquatic Nitrogen Cycle Overview
While nitrogen fixation is likely a dominant source of aquatic nitrogen in pelagic ocean waters, terrestrial run-off and anthropogenic additions are the most important inputs of bioavailable N in freshwater and near-shore marine systems (Moore et. ai., 2009). Nitrogen input through anthropogenic means and nitrogen fixation to a minor extent is offset (wholly or in part) by the permanent removal of nitrogen to the atmosphere by denitrification. When inorganic nitrogen is introduced into the aquatic environment, it cycles in the water column as a dissolved mineral form of N or becomes assimilated by primary producers. The biomass of primary producers (algae and cyanobacteria) may be recycled within the water column, however some portion will sink to the sediments and be recycled there. N-pools in the sediment include: organic N, porewater ammonium from remineralization of organic matter, pore water nitrate, and dissolved nitrogen gases

7

(Blackburn & Henriksen, 1983). These N-pools are constantly manipulated by microbially facilitated processes: remineralization, ammonification, ammonia assimilation, assimilatory nitrate reduction, dissolved reduction of nitrate into ammonia (DRNA), nitrification and denitrification.

1.2 Overview of Specific Nitrogen Cycling Processes

1.2.1 Remineralization of Nitrogen
Remineralization is the regeneration of inorganic nitrogen when organic nitrogen is metabolized, typically remineralization involves the production of ammonium through deamination or degradation of urea. This process is a by-product of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and is mediated by a wide variety of heterotrophic microorganisms (e.g. algae, fungi, bacteria) in sediments. The transport of nutrients from the sediment to the water column is an internal loading of nitrogen as it is distinguished from the external loading of terrestrially-derived nitrogen into an aquatic system. Internal loading may be an important source of ammonium from remineralization (ammonification) to the water column. Deep open waters like Lake Michigan favours this internal recycling where 95% of nutrient loading is internal, with nutrients recycled from the sediment to the water column (Brooks & Edgington, 1994). Nitrogen may continuously cycle between the sediment and water column, until it is permanently lost to the atmosphere through nitrification/denitrification processes (Presing et. al., 2001). Remineralization may also occur by means of N-rich metabolite excretions from zooplankton and fish, and release of contents during cell lysis due to parasitism. The remineralization rate from the sediment

8

to the water column is defined by primary production, the deposition rate of the primary production and sediment resuspension (Farias, 2003).

Ecological Significance of Remineralization The importance of remineralization is to regenerate inorganic nitrogen making it available to phytoplankton. This intemalloading of nitrogen can be the major source of nitrogen that would support primary pelagic production during late summer and fall (Farias, 2003). With an upwelling of nutrients into the water column, the pelagic microbial community becomes more diverse with increasing competition than their benthic counterparts (McCarthy et. al., 2007). McCarthy, et. al. (2007) suggest that Atmosphere

phytoplankton (Le. cyanobacteria) can be nitrogen limited even when there is abundant nitrate if ammonium concentrations are low. During summer when phytoplankton biomass is at its highest, the N-compounds are incorporated as follows: ammonium> urea> nitrate (Presing et. ai., 2001). Therefore, the supply of remineralized nitrogen may determine microbial community dominance and influence the trophic status of the lake system as shown in the conceptual diagram (Figure 1-2) illustrating aquatic N-cycling. Although the sediment region would become the source of recycled dissolved inorganic nitrogen (i.e. nitrate and ammonium) delivered to the overlying water, the benthic region (e.g. Northwestern Atlantic ridges) may be an N-sink as nitrate flux into the sediment may exceed ammonium efflux during the summer (Laursen & Seitzinger, 2002). Principally, all microorganisms involved in organic degradation participate in ammonification. During ammonification, organic nitrogen compounds (e.g. urea, amino acids) become hydrolyzed and deaminated to form carbon dioxide, ammonia, and ammonium under oxidizing conditions. For every molecule of urea oxidized, two molecules of ammonia are produced. Amines are produced under anaerobic ammonification. Heterotrophic bacteria facilitate this assimilation of nitrogen into the ammonifying organism. This incorporation of ammonium is utilized for metabolic purposes where the excess is distributed into the surrounding sediment for local uptake by primary producers and bacteria or use as an energy substrate by nitrifiers (Farias, 2003).

10

Factors Influencing Remineralization This remineralization process is largely determined by the amount of available and reactive organic matter (derived from benthic primary production and deposition), sediment redox properties (oxic conditions vs. anoxic conditions), bioturbation and nutrient accumulation and burial rate (Farias, 2003). Internal loading of remineralized nitrogen from sediments to the water column may be facilitated by diffusion or turbulent mixing and resuspension of sediments. Resuspension may increase remineralization by exposing buried metabolites for reoxidation and transferring substrate particles to the oxic layer (Aller, 1994). Sediment disturbances by benthic organisms (e.g. Tubifex tubifex) may also occur frequently during summer to increase nutrient exchange between sediment and water and stimulate remineralization (Scott et. al., 2008). Warm temperatures in the summer (e.g. Great Lakes) may increase remineralization effects, with nutrient flux from sediments increasing with lake temperature and mixing (Klump et. aI., 2009).

1.2.2 Nitrification
Nitrification is mediated by chemolithotrophic bacteria: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). AOB belong to the Proteobacteria group where they are further characterized into subclasses of Beta (Le. Nitrosospira and

Nitrosonomas) mainly inhibiting freshwater and Gamma (Le. Nitrosococcus) mainly
inhibiting marine environments, and NOB of the Alpha Proteobacteria subclass (i.e.

Nitrobacter) and Nitrospira genera are most widely studied in aquatic systems (Fortunato

11

et. ai., 2009). In lake environments, nitrification is initially facilitated by Nitrosomonas to
produce nitrite from the oxidation of ammonium: NH/ + 111202 ~ NO-2 + H20 + 2H+,
~G

= -290 kJ/mol

and then by Nitrobacter to oxidize the resultant nitrite into nitrate (Risgaard-Petersen, 2003):
~G

= -82 kJ/mol

Generally, ammonium oxidation will proceed at a higher rate than nitrite oxidation. This is for reasons that ammonium oxidizers have higher half-saturation constants for substrate uptake and tolerance of lower oxygen concentrations before inhibition, and a greater substrate affinity than nitrite oxidizers (Miranda et. ai., 2008). This process occurs in the water column and in the oxic sediment layer. The sediment consists of two layers, the oxic and anoxic layers, where nitrification and denitrification occur respectively (Liikanen et. ai., 2002). Organic nitrogen is known to stimulate nitrification by supplying ammonium through remineralization (Meyer et. at., 2001).

Ecological Significance of Nitrification While nitrifying chemoautotrophs assist in nitrate production, nitrification also becomes an important pathway for carbon fixation, especially during dark cycles and deep water bodies. Both Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter mainly assimilate carbon dioxide through the RuBisCo of the citric acid cycle where the latter synthesizes polyhydroxybutyrate to decrease the inhibitory effects of organic matter (Poughon et. ai., 200 I). Carbon fixation via nitrification may account for a significant fraction of total fixed carbon. In coastal marine sediments, nitrification accounted for as much as 50% of total carbon fixation

12

(calculated from Laursen & Seitzinger, 2002). Nitrifiers may also compete with methane oxidizers for oxygen, which could suppress either methane or ammonium oxidation depending on the organic carbon available (Henriksen & Kemp, 1988). Elevated ammonium conditions, such as in Seine Estuary, France, created conditions of up to 60% total oxygen consumed by nitrification (Andersson et.

at., 2006). Even in coastal marine

sediments with relatively low ammonium, nitrification may account for as much as 10% of oxygen consumption (calculated from Laursen & Seitzinger, 2002). Nitrification functions to remove ammonium, a by-product of metabolism that could otherwise accumulate to toxic levels, by converting it into nitrate. Further, oxic sediment nitrification supplies nitrate and nitrite which can be used by primary producers in the water column (passell, et.

at, 2007) or sediments, or which can diffuse into anoxic

sediments and be permanently removed through denitrification. However, highly labile carbon favours use of oxygen in respiration in freshwater environments, and methanotrophs have a greater affinity to oxygen and may reproduce 1O-fold faster than nitrifiers (Megmw & Knowles, 1987). Nitrification is also ecologically significant as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, may be formed as a nitrification intermediate (Bouwman et. ai., 1995).

Factors Influencing Nitrification Nitrification optimally operates under conditions of substantial exchangeable N~+ pool, low temperature, a moderately alkaline pH (8.0 - 8.5), low light, and relatively moderate dissolved oxygen content (Skadsen, 2002; Zhou, 2007). Sensitive to water temperature, nitrifier biodiversity changes and nitrification rates increase with a temperature rise from

13

4°C to 24°C (Miranda et. al., 2008). As a self limiting system, nitrification lowers surrounding pH levels during nitrite production. However, photosynthesis may raise pH permitting nitrification to proceed without becoming self-limiting, thus producing a fairly narrow pH range in which nitrifiers function. As pH becomes greater than -8.5, the availability of ammonium decreases (as NH/ deprotonates, forming ammonia gas) (Skadsen, 2002). Therefore, algal blooms producing pH greater than 9 may hinder nitrifier processes (Lundholm et. ai., 2004). High alkaline conditions during summer algal blooms may promote phosphorus release from the sediment and accumulate toxic NH3 which may further inhibit nitrifier activity (Focht & Verstraete, 1977; Vrede et. aI., 2009). The relationship with benthic photosynthesis is thus complex. Moderate levels of photosynthesis produce moderately alkaline conditions and provide labile organic matter for mineralization. Although these factors enhance nitrification, high rates of photosynthesis increase ammonium competition and create more extreme alkaline conditions which are detrimental to nitrifiers. Organic rich sediment containing easily assimilable carbon may provide sediment heterotrophs a competitive advantage over nitrifiers. As a result, nitrate may be produced with low yield (Krishnan & Bharathi, 2009). The presence of organic carbon may diminish the rate and yield of nitrate production by diverting nitrogen from the nitrifiers to the heterotrophs. This depends on the C:N ratio and the quality of the organic compounds. High C:N and higher levels of labile organic carbon inhibits nitrification by decreasing nitrite oxidizing bacteria, whereas low C:N and high refractory organic carbon content enhances nitrification (Xi a et. ai., 2008).

14

Microbial photosynthesis and respiration processes may also alter pH conditions as well as oxygen content, and inorganic carbon and nitrogen pools (Garnier & Billen, 2007). Nitrification may be conducted as this aerobic process by itself or its efficiency could be improved with the coupling of reducing agents by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria (Poughon et. aI., 2001). De Beer (2002) demonstrated that despite the inhibition effects of daylight, nitrification rate was proportional to the oxygen produced during photosynthesis. However, an excess may reduce nitrification due to oxygen limitation as oxygen is consumed in the remineralization process (Joye & Hollibaugh, 1995). Competition of active binding sites may limit nitrifying rates with the exposure of seasonal precipitation. The precipitation of CaC03 is characteristic of hard water lakes in early summer (e.g. Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario), where Mg+2 and Mn+2 compete with Ca+2 for C03- binding sites essentially enhancing carbon precipitation (Le. MgCOv3 and MnC03). Since nitrification is driven by chemolithotrophs, inorganic carbon becomes less available to support this nitrifying process (Farias, 2003; Hodell & Sche1ske, 1998; Jahnke & Jahnke, 2000). Similarly in the presence of iron (essential in N-fixation processes as it is a co-enzyme in the nitrogenase complex), the ferrous and ferric iron form prevalent in low pH environments may decrease nitrification as they strongly complex with organic matter to lower the supply of ammonium through organic matter remineralization (Baeseman et. aI., 2006; Routh et. ai., 2008). In addition, H 2S irreversibly inhibits nitrification (Joye & Hollibaugh, 1995). Mainly in marine environments, the associated free sulphide intermediates (i.e. HzS and S2-) from dissimlatory sulphate reduction will inhibit both nitrification and denitrification. Sulfide inhibition of nitrification is particularly important in marine systems where sulphate

15

reduction can contribute up to 20-40% organic matter reduction (Blackburn & Blackburn, 1993; Heggie et. ai., 2008; Hulth et. at., 1999; Joye & Hollibaugh, 1995). Iron oxide may potentially decrease sulphide inhibition by binding to HS- to form FeS. These metal bound sulphides (e.g. FeS) are an abundant component in freshwater sediments (Holmer
& Storkholm, 2001).

Seasonal factors influence plume sedimentation, sediment resuspension, and horizontal advection to increase sediment deposition (Filstrup et. at., 2009). Potentially spring nitrification rates may perform optimally as inhibiting labile carbon in sediment is low and turbulent mixing results in low light penetration (Filstrup et. at., 2009; Ward et. at., 1982). Possible seasonal transition in dissolved inorganic nitrogen composition from ammonium (spring) to nitrate (summer) may occur (Sugimoto et. ai., 2008). Summer nitrification may experience competition with heterotrophs as their populations increase with periphyton layer. Although ammonium pools are relatively high due to summer ammonification, nitrification becomes restricted to the diminished oxic layer until lake freezing (Kemp et. ai., 1990). During winter nitrate may be at its highest despite cold temperatures inhibiting nitrification as denitrification is also inhibited by low average winter lake temperatures (Filstrup et. al., 2009).

1.2.3 Denitrification
The denitrifying process is the reduction of nitrate through several intermediate N-species, ultimately to dinitrogen gas, although the term can also be applied to the reduction of any

16

one intermediate to N2, or to a second intermediate (Tesoriero, et. ai, 2000). The overall process can be represented as: 2NO)- + 12 H+ + 1Oe- ~ N2 + 6H 20 (non-specific e- donor) Denitrifying bacteria are ubiquitous, and are phylogenetically diverse with bacterial groups: Bacillus, Enterobacter, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Spirillum, and other anerobes containing some or all of the suite of enzymes to catalyze steps in the denitrifying pathway (Zhou, 2007). While denitrification is generally considered a bacterial process, the ability to denitrify has been reported in some archaea and eukaryotes (fungi) as well (Zumft, 1997). Most denitrifiers are facultative anaerobic heterotrophs that utilize denitrification as an alternative respiratory system and are able to grow equally well or better in oxygen. Conversely, the oxidation of inorganic carbon may be a different energy source for autotrophic denitrifiers that are not as widespread_ Intermediate steps between the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas form nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide in order of sequence. By-products of this respiratory pathway are formed as well and are released as bicarbonate and sulphate ions, and carbon dioxide (Rivett et. aI., 2008)_

1.2.3.1 Nitrate Sources for Denitrification
Coupling of Nitrification and Denitrification With ample nutrient supply, stable bacterial community and minimal sediment bioturbation, the coupling of nitrification with denitrification is made possible (Lorenzen

et. al., 1998). Under high organic sediment load via the mineralization process,
ammonium is made available for nitrification. Respiring bacteria readily consume

17

oxygen to metabolize organic carbon. At the periphyton surface where oxygen is plentiful (either by diffusion or photosynthetic production), nitrate becomes a dominant form of inorganic nitrogen. However, the nitrifiers must also compete with autotrophs for ammonium, and this competition can reduce nitrogen loss by denitrification when bacterial respiration out competes nitrifiers for available ammonium (Risgaard-Petersen, 2003). On the other hand, coupled nitrification/denitrification may be supported by photoautotrophs during photosynthesis as the depth of nitrification increases with greater sediment oxygen penetration (Rysgaard, et. ai, 1994).

In the case of active sediment bioturbation, resuspension and/or benthic primary
production under low N03- and NH4+ concentrations during summer, nitrification in the sediment oxic layer will become evenly distributed allowing for the nitrification/denitrification coupling to become less efficient. This potentially may provide a greater opportunity for nitrate to be incorporated into primary production instead of denitrification (Rysgaard et. ai., 1995). However, bioturbation by various invertebrates either produced no effect or increased denitrification by providing additional oxygen surface area to improve nitrification (Howe et. al., 2004; Karlson, 2007; Svensson et. af., 2001). A greater oxygen depth penetration decreases the likelihood of nitrate loss to the water column, by delivering nitrate directly to the denitrification layer. However, this same oxic layer may act as a barrier to prevent the uptake of nitrate from the water column, even under high nitrate concentrations, as nitrifiers may become inhibited by an oxygen excess. Under 02 concentrations greater than 200 j.1M, nitrifiers may retreat to the lower oxic region above the anoxic/oxic boundary (Jensen, et. ai, 1994). Essentially, nitrification is the limiting factor for this coupling to exist. Thus, any

18

conditions where ammonium and oxygen supply cease it would consequently stop nitrification and subsequently denitrification under conditions of little water column nitrate diffusive supp1y (B1ackburn et. ai., 1994).

Diffusion from the 'Vater C01umn In addition to coupled nitrification-denitrification, denitrifiers may receive nitrate by direct diffusion from the water c01umn. Nitrate is soluble in water, possibly traveling great distances under less stagnant waters (Le. rivers, streambeds) and is delivered to the anoxic layer depending on periphyton constituents (Duff et. aI., 2008; MennillodBlondin et. al., 2008; Rust et. al., 2(00). Microphytobenthos particularly prokaryotes, may significantly affect this diffusion of nitrate as well as ammonia from pore water by means of assimilatory uptake (Seitzinger & Nixon, 1985). Nitrate uptake by assimilation may out compete denitrification for available nitrate when photoautrophic production is high. Despite these interferences, nitrate diffusion is dependent on both the oxic zone depth and the nitrate concentration within the water column, as implied by Fick's laws of diffusion (Lavery et. aI., 2(01). Denitrification supported by direct diffusion is restricted to the thickness of the oxic zone that controls the nitrate diffusional supply. Diffused nitrate is dependent on oxygen sediment depth penetration. The nitrate gradient profile becomes less steep with a longer diffusional path created by this sediment oxygen penetration on the sedimentwater interface and a.-;sociating bacterial nitrifying interactions (Risgaard-Petersen el. ai., 1994). Under these oxic conditions, nitrate diffusive flux may approximate net denitrification and will be lower than the gross denitrification rate where some coupled

19

nitrification-denitrification occurs. Nitrate diffusive flux would approximate gross denitrification rates without coupled nitrification, where denitrification is supported solely by external nitrate (Groffman et. at., 2006). Nitrate diffusion may slow above nitrate concentrations greater than 4 mg L- 1 that would support N-accumulation along the sediment-water interface and decreased nitrate concentration gradient within the sediment (James et. at., 2008). These high nitrate situations are a result of saturated enzymes in denitrifier bacteria which may also result in low substrate efficiency and velocity.

1.2.3.2 Ecological Significance of Denitrification
Nitrogen losses in freshwater through denitrification have been estimated to account for between 1% and 36% of the total N-loading, also removing as much as 40-50% of inorganic nitrogen loading in estuaries (Seitzinger, 1988). In some cases, lakes were estimated to retain more than 50% of their N-inputs where a maximum 87% of N-inputs were removed (Alexander et. at., 2002). It was estimated that global lake N-removal to be 19.7 Tg N yr-I from watersheds, about 4 times the N-removal quantity than in estuaries (-5 Tg N yr-l) (Seitzinger et. at., 2006). Small lakes (size < 50 km ) may remove 9.3 Tg N year'l which is almost half of the total global lake N-input (13.0 Tg N year'I), a greater quantity than the large lake N-removal quantity of 3.7 Tg N year'I. These global estimates may be attributed to these smaller lakes generally having a greater surface area (2.6 x 106 km2) in comparison to large lakes (1.2 x 10 km
6 2 ).

2

Such values were suggested

to be underestimated, leading to a more significant effect of small lakes removing nitrogen via denitrification especially for countries with high lake densities (e.g. Canada) (Harrison et. al., 2008).

20

--------------------------------------~

Nitrogen availability in open lake bodies and especially in estuarine environments are based on denitrification because there are very few aquatic organisms (Le. cyanobacteria) that can utilize N2 as a nitrogen source (Risgaard-Petersen, 2003). Marine systems are generally nitrogen limited, and most of their eutrophication problems including hypoxic and anoxic dead zones and formation of harmful algal blooms can be attributed to nitrogen pollution (National Academy of Science, 2000). Denitrification becomes important to these systems as it is the major processes, besides anaerobic ammonia oxidation (ANAMMOX) that can ameliorate these impacts by permanently removing nitrogen (Conley et. ai., 2009). Denitrification is also ecologically significant as some toxic (NOn and environmentally destructive (N20) intermediates are formed. Nitrite accumulation is typically negligible and nitrite is often not measurable in aquatic systems. Nitrous oxide production resulting from denitrification in aquatic systems, however, does contribute significantly to the atmospheric pool. As described above, this can contribute to radiative forcing and, potentially, to stratospheric ozone depletion.

1.2.3.3 Influential Environmental Factors of Denitrification
Organic Carbon Globally, lakes are accumulating organic carbon at an estimated rate of -42 Tg C yr-t. where large lakes contribute to about 15% (6-7 Tg C yr-I) (Filstrup et. ai., 2009). An increase in organic matter loading to sediments could stimulate remineralization and nitrification/denitrification (Wetzel, 1983). Jordan, et. al. (2009) stated that ammonia
dcposit~

from invertebrates may not contribute to enhanced denitrification rates if not

21

associated with an increase in labile carbon, as the lack of organic carbon for heterotrophic denitrifiers to accept electrons may hinder denitrification (Rivett et. al., 2008). Improved NHt+ fluxes and anoxia resulting in the sediment release of phosphorus from oxidized iron may be an effect of both a large organic deposit and reduced denitrification (Eyre & Ferguson, 2002; Lavery & McComb, 1991; Owens & Stewart, 1983). Heterotrophic denitrification mainly depends on bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within the immediate vicinity of the porewater and groundwater rather than the total carbon content of the region (Rivett et. al., 2008). This process is able to convert 0.93 mg N L- 1 nitrate from 1 mg L- 1 carbon based on the stoichiometry (Jacinthe

et. al., 2003; J~rgensen et. ai., 2004):
5CH zO + 4N03- ~ 2Nz + 4HC03- + COz + 3HzO Primarily controlled by mineralization, DOC may vary in concentration according to pH, temperature, oxidant concentrations, sorption affinities to mineral surfaces and DOC chemical composition (Hartoget. ai., 2004).

Local Redox Potential Denitrification may only be permitted to react with a relatively small quantity of dissolved oxygen or nitrate (Hartog et. ai., 2004). Apart from the redox properties of the periphyton layer, rates of denitrification/nitrification may depend on the thickness of the periphyton layer (upper organic layer of sediment). This periphyton layer may also prevent water column carbon and dissolved inorganic nutrients from penetrating into deeper sediment regions by acting as a physical biomass barrier (Woodruff et. al., 1999).

22

Nutrient impenneable sediment barriers, such as a thick periphyton layer, define nitrification as the major supplier of nitrate substrate to the denitrification process in some instances (Jordan et. ai., 2(09). Traditionally denitrification rates are measured in the sediment, however, Ishida,

et. al. (2008) have shown that the periphyton layer were also capable of denitrification.
Microbial metabolic activity consumes oxygen within periphyton, creating a solute gradient that would permit an anoxic layer deep in the periphyton where denitrification (simultaneously inhibiting nitrification) can occur, limiting nitrate diffusion into sediment and denitrification in sediment (Ishida et. al., 2008; Krause-Jensen et. al., 1999). The metabolic photoautotrophic activity may be dependent on the periphyton assemblages which are characteristic of their substrate and nutrient environment. Nitrifiers may benefit from this periphyton layer as algae and cyanobacteria within this biofilm supply labile carbon by the release of extracellular organic compounds and algal decomposition (Ishida

et. aI., 2(08).

Dissolved Oxygen Denitrification requires low oxygen concentrations (02 < 1 - 2 mgIL) in order to proceed (DeSimone & Howes, 1998). Oxygen saturation regulates the genes that encode the enzymes required for denitrification, where gene expression is inhibited by high oxygen concentrations (02) 1 IlM) (Canfield et. al., 2005; Curie et. ai., 2009; Seitzinger, 1988). Therefore, it is essential for denitrification to operate near the oxic/anoxic interface in sediments and biofilms. Sediment oxygen penetration depths and bottom water nitrate concentrations may vary independently within estuaries (Revsbech et. al., 1980).

23

Balance between periphyton production and respiration, as well as sediment porosity and chemical oxygen demand will determine oxygen depth penetration. As previously stated, sediment oxygen penetration decreases with oxygen consumption (Duff et. aI., 2008). Oxygen penetration may increase with photosynthesis activity during daylight, where produced oxygen may reduce immediate surface denitrification rates by as much as 70%. As a result, water column nitrate may penetrate deeper into the anoxic sediment strata without stimulating denitrification (Blackburn & Henriksen, 1983).

Electron Acceptors and Donors Under anoxic conditions, obligate anaerobes become dominant and utilize available electron acceptors according to their free energy (Korom, 1992):

N03-: ~G=-72.3 Kjlelectron > Mn4+:~G= -50.3Kj/electron > Fe3+: ~G= 4.6Kjlelectron > S04-2 : ~G= 21.4 Kjlelectron

Based on relative abundance in freshwater systems and energy yield, nitrate is typically the most favoured alternate electron acceptor once oxygen is depleted. Once nitrate supplies have been exhausted, the oxidation of organic matter may proceed with other electron acceptors, typically in the sequence Mn4+, Fe (Froelich et. ai., 1979). The reduction of nitrate by Fe+2 ions may be conducted as either biotic or abiotic processes, or even both. Gallionellaferruginea bacteria are known to facilitate the biotic nitrate reduction. Generally found near the anoxic/oxic boundary since it requires a small
3

+, S04-2and then fermentation

24

quantity of oxygen, G. ferruginea reduce nitrate into nitrite under conditions of abundant ferrous iron (Korom, 1992). The abiotic fonnation of nitrite from the oxidation of Fe+2 may continue as long as there is available organic carbon which Fe+3 can oxidize in order to regenerate Fe2+ (Davidson et. aI., 2003). Under organic poor surroundings, denitrification may continue as Fe+3 terminally accepts electrons and precipitates into oxyhydroxide or oxide mineral (Korom, 1992). Metal catalysis (e.g. Cu+2) may playa role in promoting these. reduction reactions (Ottley et. aI., 1997).

Temperature and pH Nitrate and oxygen limit denitrification with temperature as a minor influence on a global scale (Silvennoinen et. al., 2008), although correlation between temperature and denitrification may be weak in some studies (Silvennoinen et. al., 2008). Denitrification may operate at temperatures ranging from 2 to 50°C, where optimum temperatures lie between 25 and 35°C (Brady & Weil, 2002). It could be assumed as the temperature increases, oxygen consumption increases while oxygen solubility decreases, subsequently facilitating other electron acceptors to continue the carbon degradation process (Harrison

et. aI., 2008; Liikanen et. al., 2002). Although climate could affect N loading by
changing the runoff balance and evapotranspiration, denitrification is subject to more significant immediate effects (e.g. nutrient runoff) (Harrison et. al., 2008). Although optimal pH levels for denitrification are site specific, heterotrophic denitrifiers may prefer a pH range between 5.5 and 8.0 (Rust et. ai., 2000). Acidic environments (around 3.5 pH), such as industrial mining work areas, were shown to have a relatively low nitrate consumption and low pH would seem to inhibit denitrification

25

(Baeseman et. al., 2006). Dissimilatory ferric iron reduction may also inhibit denitrification as these pathways compete for electrons under low pH conditions (Rust et.

at., 2000). Nitrite may be reactive under these pH conditions, particularly with ferric iron
and light, existing as nitrous acid (protonated form) which was demonstrated to inhibit nitrate reduction at low concentrations of 0.04 mg L- t HN02-N (Abeling & Seyfried, 1992). Under alkaline conditions (pH > 8), denitrification may be stimulated by the production of nitrate from ammonium or nitrite by the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fanning, 2000). Nitrate reduction by iron is pH dependent as ferric oxide or oxyhydroxide precipitation are formed from Fe+3 under neutral or alkaline conditions, hence denying iron access in denitrification (Ottley et. al., 1997).

Seasonality Denitrification rates become relatively low during spring/fall seasons ensuring that sediment nitrogen maintains high concentration nitrate gradients. Although spring denitrification rates may be relatively small, these rates may could be at least twice as great as those in winter due to improved daylight water penetration from relatively low microphytobenthos and high mineralization (Heggie et. al., 2008). Both spring and fall seasons were reported to have the lowest seasonal ammonium and NOx concentrations in the water column. According to the relatively high summer microbial efficiency and velocity from well-mixed lake conditions, high net ammonium release and low NOx uptake may lead to greater organic matter decomposition, enhanced ammonium release, and improved anoxic conditions for denitrification (Risgaard-Petersen, 2003). However, Spooner &

26

Maher (2009) reported that denitrification efficiencies may be at their lowest from receiving bay sediment of a dairy farm. Denitrification may also become less efficient under reducing conditions (Le.low electron acceptors) where DRNA is favoured. Simultaneously, maximum benthic microbial consumption of surrounding oxygen may lower oxygen sediment penetration, limiting nitrification and coupled denitrification (Filstrup et.

at., 2(09). Low microbial activity during the winter may contribute to low

denitrification and accumulation of nitrate in the water column. As water begins to warm in the spring, water column nitrate is the dominant source of nitrate supporting denitrification (Risgaard-Petersen, 2(03).

1.2.4 DRNA
Dissimlatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DRNA) functions in the anoxic sediment layer to produce ammonia from available nitrate pools. Denitrification competes with DRNA for nitrate as their nitrogen source, however, denitrification is generally dominant in freshwater environments (Scott et.

at., 2(08). The reduction of ammonia is

orchestrated by obligatory anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria which produce their energy from electron transport phosphorylation in the initial reduction step (Le. N03- reduction to NOn (Strohm et.

at., 2007; Tiedje, 1988). Conditions of high surrounding organic

matter for electron donation in the presence of limited nitrate contributes to optimum N03- reduction, and subsequent optimum phosphorylation (Tiedje, 1988; Tiedje et. al.,

1983). The later reduction of nitrite to ammonia serves as a co-enzyme oxidation station
to re-energize the electron transport chain and to detoxify harmful nitrite. As previously stated, nitrification may act as an ammonia sink, converting ammonia back to nitrate and

27

may potentially be stimulated by DRNA (Burgin & Hamilton, 2007). An increased periphyton layer low in nitrates is also known to contribute to DRNA competition for ammonia (Harrison et. ai., 2008; Liikanen et. aI., 2002). By strictly observing the free energy produced between denitrification and DRNA (Tiedje, 1988):

Denitrification
2N03- + 2H+ + 5H z ~ N2 + 6 H 20, i1Go = -1,120.5 kJ per reaction

DRNA
N03 + 2 H+ + 4Hz ~ NH4+ + 3 H 20, i1Go

=-599.6 kJ per reaction

According to the greater free energy produced, denitrification may be the favoured reaction. However, Tiedje, (1988) demonstrated that denitrification had a lower free energy yield with respect to the net redox reaction of DRNA. This energy difference is attributed to DRNA having a greater electron transfer efficiency (8 electrons transferred per mole of nitrate in comparison to 5 electron transferred per nitrate mole) found in denitrification's electron transport chain. These findings corresponded with the greater amount of cells produced with DRNA when compared to the denitrification process (Strohm et. al., 2007). DRNA activity also will increase with increased sediment mineralization (Harrison et. ai., 2008; Liikanen et. al., 2002). Increased saline conditions may favour DRNA over denitrification but become less significant in lake environments due to the inhibition nature of sulphic compounds (abundant in marine conditions) on nitrification and denitrification (Sabumon, 2009).

28

1.3 Nitrous Oxide Production in Aquatic Systems
1.3.1 Nitrous oxide Production by Nitrification
In nitrification, production of nitrous oxide is initiated by the oxidation of ammonia to
nitrate that may produce unstable intermediates (e.g. hydroxylamine, NH20H) that are likely bind to enzyme complexes and contribute to production of NO and N 20 specifically under low oxygen (De Bie et. al., 2002; J~rgensen et. al., 1984; Kester et. al., 1997). The redox potential of this ammonia oxidation is -248 ± 25 m V when nitrate is produced in the presence of organic carbon (Sabumon, 2009). Facilitated by the enzyme ammonia mono oxygenase in proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers (Le. genera:

Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus, Nitrosopspira, Nitrosovibrio and Nitrosolobus)
(Laanbroek et. al., 1994), ammonia is initially oxidized to hydroxylamine in either oxic or anoxic environments (Schmidt et. al., 2003):

Aerobic
6GO = -120 kJlM

Anaerobic
6GO =-140 kJlM
The anaerobic production of hydroxylamine produces greater free energy as the N204 dimer was more productive than the anammox nitrite and nitrate electron acceptors (Bodelier et. al., 1996). The enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase further oxidizes hydroxylamine into nitrite, where nitrite is oxidized into nitrate by nitrite oxidizers (Fernandez et. ai., 2008). Under low oxygen and high N~+ content, nitrous oxide is produced from the incomplete nitrification process (Goreau et. al., 1980):
I

"

29

Nitrification is the primary source of nitrous oxide produced in the water column. In sediments, however, while nitrous oxide may be produced by nitrification, denitrification is the major contributor (Silvennoinen et. al., 2008; Sutka et. al., 2006).

1.3.2 Nitrous oxide Production by Denitrification
Summer periods in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes can see the establishment of anoxic to hypoxic conditions in the hypolimnion (e.g. 5 to 30 flM O2) suitable for nitrous oxide accumulation from denitrification (Twining et. at., 2007; Yoh et. al., 1983). Nitrous oxide production via denitrification occurs in the oxic/anoxic sediment boundary under conditions of high copper complexation by organic ligands (i.e. bioavailable copper complexed to carbonate in alkaline lake water/seawater) and reduced sulphur species (Mengis et. al., 1997). Copper nitrite reductase enzyme requires copper to immediately reduce nitrite toxic effects by converting it to nitrous oxide (Granger & Ward, 2003). Ideal N20 production conditions would involve a reducible bioavailable copper form in low concentrations due to its metal toxicity. Lake humic organic matter, and thiolligands produced by surface eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms prevent copper toxicity and are also other sources of competitive copper complexation (Twining et. al., 2007). A similar siderophore compound may be generated by methane-oxidizing bacteria in the presence of limited copper (Kim et. al., 2004). Although copper sediment may be variable within different sediment sites, copper remains a trace metal in lakes since it readily undergoes chemical complexation, precipitation, and adsorption from the water column into the sediment. Other metal complexation options for nitrous oxide reductase could be iron which is the closest chemical substitute and may experience similar metal

30

conservation strategies within the phytoplankton community under metal limitation (Twining et. al., 2007).

1.3.3 Global significance of Nitrous Oxide Production in Lakes
In the last century, nitrous oxide production from anthropogenic sources has been

estimated to contribute about one third of the global total for N 20 production (Khalil & Rasmussen, 1992; Seitzinger et. al., 2000). Freshwater systems contribute less than 20% of the total annual global N 20 emissions (Khalil & Rasmussen, 1992; Seitzinger et. al., 2000; Wang et. aI., 2009). Oxygen deficient regions contribute to benthic nitrous oxide saturation within freshwater lakes, specifically mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes (Svensson, 1998; Wang et. aI., 2009; Yoh et. ai., 1983). The hypolimnetic region in oxic lakes and marine environments during summer stratification is also a source of saturated N 20, where nitrous oxide (relatively inert) diffuses from the sediment into the water column (Mengis et. al.. 1996). Periods of transient oxygen change further emphasizes N20 accumulation (Naqvi et. aI., 2000). Of the dinitrogen gas produced during denitrification, N20 was reported to be in a range of 0.1 - 0.5% of the atmospheric Ntotal. Dong (2006) recorded a 3.3% N20:N2 ratio where eutrophic conditions may create values as high as 6% (Dong et. al., 2006; Seitzinger & Kroeze, 1998). Therefore, an estimated 19.7 Tg N year- 1 (lakes and reservoirs) of global N removed by denitrification could produce 197 to 985 Gg of N per year according to Seitzinger (1998).

1.3.4 Nitrous Oxide as a Greenhouse Gas
In a recent of ozone depleting substances (ODS), it was shown that N 20 emissions were
the single most significant ODS and are expected to remain the largest throughout the 21 st century (Ravishankara et. ai., 2009). Nitrous oxide is 310 times and 15 times more efficient greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and methane, respectively, on a per molecule basis (Liikanen et. al., 2002). It is estimated that N20 concentrations are increasing by 0.25% per year by anthropogenic means (Twining et.

at., 2007), and N 20

has become the third most important greenhouse behind CO2 and C~ (Meyer et. al., 2008). Global N20 emissions from rivers, estuaries, and continental shelves are calculated to be 4.9 (1.3-13.0) Tg N in 2050, of which two-thirds are from rivers (Seitzinger & Kroeze, 1998). As an anthropogenic based greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide saturation is associated with applied ammonium. De Wilde and de Bie (2000) reported an average N 20 saturation value of 0.14% (1 mol N 20 per 700 mol N~+) and ranges of 0.04 - 0.42% N20 saturation (1:1 molar ratio, N20:NH/) were recorded in the ScheIdt Estuary (De Wilde & De Bie, 2000). Lake Taihu N20 saturation values were found to be from 70% to 1597%, where the late summer season and most eutrophic locations produced the greatest saturation values. In comparison to nitrous oxide saturation in rivers, flowing systems may be N20 saturated at values from 631 % to as high as 2708% (Wang et. al., 2009).

1.4 Influence of Nutrient Cycling on Denitrification

1.4.1 Phosphorus Biogeochemical Cycle
Phosphorus (P) is the tenth most abundant element in the world. Within the pelagic region, P can exist in both inorganic and organic forms. It is prelevant in the P04-3 form either as a free orthophosphate (Pi) or combined with organic compounds. Rarely, are Pproducts found as phosphine gas (PH3), or phosphide (-3) aquatic environments (Morton

et. at., 2005; Nriagu & Moore, 1984).
Phosphorus loading may become variable seasonally and annually from climatic variation, and can be reflected in phytoplankton biomass and community composition (Quigg et. at., 2003; Van Donka et. ai., 2008). Some phosphorus may not participate in phosphorus cycling as it enters the system associated with detrital material, poor lability and high C:P or C:N ratios (Klump et. al., 2009). Considering that fundamental role of P in cell function and cell structure (e.g. phospholipids in membranes and energy currency) and information storage (e.g. nucleic acids), phosphorus becomes readily taken up as biomass and has a relatively low existence in open water as an ionic free form (deDuve, 1991). Phosphorus is regulated under the photosynthesis production regime (Karl,2007) and commonly associated with other elemental cycles (e.g. C, 0, S) and other trace elements (e.g. Fe, Zn, Co) (DeLong & Karl, 2005). Naturally, phosphorus is globally distributed by the combined forces of continental weathering and fluvial discharge, and is continually buried and layered within the sediment floor. Within the last the few centuries, anthropogenic P additions through riverine, sewage loading. and atmospheric deposition had resulted in organic P accumulations into the coastal zones and P-output into the

33

pelagic environment. Photosynthesis is the base of the aquatic food web, supplies reduced organic carbon to all heterotrophic organisms (e.g. bacteria to whales). Deep sediment receives pelagic P through means of gravitational influence of organic particulates, the active migration of zooplankton and fish and the downward movement of dissolved organic matter. This dissolved organic matter is degraded by benthic microbes and Pi is allowed to cycle back to the surface via diffusion and convection (intemalloading) to support further primary production. This regeneration of P is termed "the biologicial pump" (Karl, 2007). Considering that phosphorus is required for the growth and development of all organisms, the N:P ratio underlies the growth potential and structure of phytoplankton comrnunites (Vrede et. ai., 2009). Most of P cycling is conducted by prokaryote (Le. bacteria and archaea) metabolic activities (Bratbak, 1987) since their relatively higher surface area/volume ratio are more efficient at uptaking P04 · These phosphates are central to transmission and energy production through the hydrolysis of the adenosine
(

triphosphate (ATP) molecule (deDuve, 1991). Alfred Redfield recognized that the relative ratios of inorganic N and P concentrations in the marine pelagic environment reflected the particulate matter whose biomass was dominated by phytoplankton. The classic Redfield ratio C:N:P ratio of 106: 16: 1 (Redfield, 1934) implies a relationship among C, N, and P, and suggests that limits on biomass production may be inferred by the ratio of available nutrients (Redfield, 1958). Further, it can be implied that an excess of inorganic N (N:P > 16) represents biomass degradation. Conversely, an excess of inorganic P (N:P < 16) implies the removal of N through denitrification. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus may be increased with increasing anaerobic decomposition rates.

34

Recent studies have suggested that increased nitrogen fixation may lead towards P limitiation in freshwater ecosystems (Bergstrom et. al., 2005; Bergstrom & Jansson, 2006; Vrede et. ai., 2009). Mesocosm studies have showed that with increased P loading there was a significant resultant particulate N content (Vrede et. aI., 2009). The relevance here is that this particulate N can be recycled either in the water column with little of the N passing through the denitrification pathway, or it can settle and be recycled in the sediments with a significant portion passing through the denitrification pathway. N fixation was positively related to total phosphate concentrations, and presumably P loading (Granhall & Lundgren, 1971; Levine & Schindler, 1999; Tonno & Noges, 2003) . . This suggests that increased particulate N linked to P loading is often in the form of cyanobacterial biomass, with N fixation permitting full exploitation of available P. When N is not limiting, P loading may increase biomass of other autotrophs as well as cyanobacteria. However, N:P loading would appear to be an important predictor of cyanobacterial growth relative to growth of other autotrophs (Smith, 1985). Lake water column mixing with increased summer temperatures will enhance microbial-mediated P release from sediments and internal loading. During winter periods phosphours may accumulate in the sediment due its sorption onto iron oxides. Eutrophic lakes particularly may have high internal P loading which may favour cyanobacteria as excess N is lost to denitrification (Vrede et. al., 2009), to be replaced by N-fixing cyanobacteria. A recently published 37-year whole-system study demonstrated that a nutrient management strategy which reduced nitrogen loading without reducing phosphorus loading could not control eutrophication, rather it shifted community composition to cyanobacterial dominance (Schindler et. al., 2008).

35

In a Canadian context, governmental actions (e.g. banning phosphates in detergents and government grants for improved sewage systems) of the Canada Water Bill 1970s were implemented to decrease phosphorus loading (Le. municipal sewage plants and argricultural runofO into lake ecosystems (McGucken, 2000). However, Lake Erie experienced a rise in total phosphorus from 1990 to 1997 and generally decreased its rate in 1999 and 2000 (Dolan & McGunagle, 2005). In the early 1980s, zebra mussels were introduced to Lake Erie in which a large quantity of organic matter was removed from the water column to the sediment. This situation could enhance denitrification by moving organic N remineralization from the water column to the sediments, thereby decreasing N:P in the water column and favouring cyanobacteria (Bykova et. at., 2006). During summer in lake Erie, nutrients associated with organic matter settle from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion causing the decrease of total phosphorus that ranged 0.012 ug L- t yr -I to 0.57 ug L- t yr-. (Rockwell et. at., 2005). Relevant to this thesis, nutrient management plans which specifically target N, trophic changes that enhance deposition of organic matter and denitrification, and physicaVbiological factors that enhance P release from sediment all have potential to change N:P loading ratios (external and internal considered), in a way that favors cyanobacterial growth. As will be discussed below, changes in primary producer community could affect delivery of organic matter to sediments through differences in buoyancy. This could affect where organic nitrogen is recycled (water column versus sediments), which consequently affects nitrogen processing.

1.4.2 Silica Biogeochemical Cycle
(

Silica exists in the environment as Si02 as part of macrocrystalline fonnations (quartz, rock crystal, amethyst, etc.), microcrystalline fonnations (flint, chert, jasper, etc.) and is a large component of sand and sandstone (Hem, 1985). Silicates (silicon combination with other elements) make up feldspar, hornblende, mica, asbestos and other clay minerals. Silica is also found in granite, basalt and shale. Silica is present in rock at 7-80% on average, and 50-80% in soil. The common silica aqueous fonns are H4 Si04 and H 3Si04-. High dissolved Si may be around 40-60 uM relative to low dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (NOx + 1.9uM N~+) and dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations. During organic matter diagensis in sediments, flux of Si(OH)4 to the water column relative to carbon mineralized has a mean ratio of 0.6 Si: 1C, with a range between 0.30 to 0.86 in marine systems (Jahnke & Jahnke, 2000). Biologically. Si is essential in animal dietary needs and a nonessential nutrient for plants. Dissolved Si is essential for diatoms to construct frustules and Si can be a limiting nutrient for diatom growth. Dissolved Si can be used as a unique tracer for diatomaceous organic matter, flux of dissolved Si and inorganic nitrogen following organic matter diagenesis may be correlated since diatoms require Si02 to fonn new frustules and to divide (Ouillard & Kilham, 1977; Heggie et. ai., 2008). A Si:N flux of -1: 1 is an indicator of diatom predominance in organic carbon (Brzezinski, 1985; Heggie et. aI., 2008). Dissolved Si availability will influence diatom abundance and its distribution. Changes in Si:N and Si:P, particularly decreases in eutrophied environments associated with increased N and P loading, have resulted in phytoplankton community and food web changes (Fransz & Verhagen, 1985; Ragueneau et. ai., 1994). For example, the Black sea

37

experienced a shift from diatoms to other non-sliceous phytoplankton mid-1960s during dam construction, as the Mediterranean was formerly P limited (1960s to 1970s) before becoming Si limited in the late 1970s (Ludwig et. al., 2009). Silica limitation may be a likely scenario in the Sargasso Sea water column as biogenic Si02 (BSi), associated with diatoms populations, have slower reminerlazation rates than particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen. Baek, et. al. (2009) demonstrated that diatoms may deal with these nutrient limitations (N and P) by constricting diatom growth, shifting the community to lower chlorophyll production and smaller cells that would better exploit the limited Nand P as it was turned over during rain events. Sinks for Si in aquatic systems are at a minimum except for burial as it does not participate in organic matter respiration as electron donor or acceptor. Silica sinks may be brought about by local hydrologic management, eutrophication and sinking of organic matter to sediment, and sediment biodeposition by invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels) (Ragueneau et. al., 2005). River dam construction (e.g. Nile River and Mississippi River) showed decreased dissolved Si concentration on the flowing side, whereas, the river build up on the opposing dam side collects Si load via diatom debris (Rabalais et. aI., 2000; Turner & Rabalais, 1994). Similar effects noted in Ludwig (2009) for the Mediterranean becoming Si limited, so be sure to see that paper. The resultant reservoirs increase lake residence times that assist to retain this Si. Eutrophic conditions are characterized as an increase in aquatic primary production, typically caused by increased Nand/or P loading, limiting silica (Schelske et.

a!., 1986; Schelske, 1988; Schelske et. aI., 2006). Although restricted Si02 may result in
diatom decline, Schelske (2006) supported that immediate P loading may by pass this

38

nutrient effect and favour diatom growth under high N:P nutrients. Along with increased diatom growth, enriched N:P may improve diatom silica utilization (Schelske et. al., 1986). Diatom sedimentation increases allowing for the improved store of sediment (BSi) and possible nutrient burial, subsequently leading to the reduction of water column BSi. Closely linked to the carbon cycle, global silica cycles are controlled via their biogenic silica form through diatom vectors. About 95% of diatom BSi is assumed to be recycled annually within the Great Lakes, where they are evenly distributed to 40% of the lake basin (Schelske, 1985; Schelske et. al., 2006; Thomas, 1981). Detrital matter dissolution could significantly reduce BSi dissolution rate in the sediment. For example, BSi accumulation in Lake Superior increases annually at 10 mg g'! when annual silica utilization in the water column is 0.21 mg Si02 L- 1 (3.5 !lmo} C 1). Since 95% of the silica is recycled, BSi accumulation would result in only a small net change in water-mass silica concentration 0.01 mg Si02 L- 1 (0.17 !lmol L- 1) (Schelske et. al., 2006). This is relevant within coastal zones where anthropogenic induced eutrophication are relatively high, and within lakes of long residence time. Research driven by changes in diatom production and its influence on biogeochemical silica cycles have been conducted in the Great Lakes. Shifts in Si:N and Si:P (decreases) have resulted from increased Nand P loading within these lakes, and from constructed obstacles (e.g. damming projects) that have retained Si in reservoirs. The net result has been a reduction in diatom abundance and increase in other algae and cyanobacteria in many systems. Therefore, shifts in elemental ratios involving Si can influence phytoplankton community composition.

1.5 Influence of Nutrient Loading and Nutrient Ratios on Phytoplankton Composition
Evidence has suggested that phytoplankton species composition is particularly sensitive to nutrient load as nutrients become limited, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus. Subsequently, ecosystem productivity becomes affected with the manipulation of trophic level complexity and stability, and microbial community species richness and abundance distribution. Anthropogenic point source discharges, NH/ and N03- atmospheric deposition, and agricultural runoff have been known to elevate chlorophyll a (chI a), phytoplankton biomass, and TP content in lake systems (e.g. the Laurentian Great Lakes). Non-point nutrient loading (i.e. smaller tributaries discharges) may account for a predominate portion of the total nutrient loading (Smith et. al.. 2007). Under eutrophic conditions, horizontal distribution of lake phytoplankton may be dominated by cyanobacteria (e.g. Anabaena) as wind currents may progressively move nutrients and microbial flock into the pelagic zone (Ishikawa, et. aI, 1999). Cyanobacteria are also capable of utilizing bicarbonate (HC03-) more efficiently than diatoms and green algae. Bicarbonate is the dominate species of dissolved inorganic carbon in many lakes (Filstrup et. al., 2009). Eutrophic diatoms, Fragilaria crontenensis and Auiacoseira, may dominate lake regions of constant mixing or nutrient loading from rivers at certain times, particularly when water temperatures are colder (Liukkonen et. aI., 1993). Filamentous green algae Spirogyra may out compete aquatic macrophytes in response to more frequent but less intense nutrient additions (Simons, 1994; Van der Linden, 1989). Green algae may increase growth rate despite the low N:P ratio content in hypereutrophic lakes with high nutrient loading (Vrede et. al., 2009).

40

Community composition and diversity shifts according to nutrient limitations where microbial adaptive qualities favour an increased contribution to total population. If a nutrient is less than half-saturation for uptake, then the environment would suggest a probable nutrient limitation scenario. Potential nutrient limitations (Baek et. al., 2009; Justic et. al., 1995) are shown as follows: N limitation: DIN < IIJM; DIN:soluble reactive P < 10; Si:DIN > 1; Dissolved organic nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium) <

P limitation:

SRP < IIJM; DIN:SRP > 22; Si:SRP > 22; SI:P> 20 and DIN:P > 20; Phosphate < 0.2 IJM

Si limitation: Si < 2 jJM; Si:SRP < 10; Si:DIN < 1; Si:P < 10 and Si:DIN < 1; Silicates < 2.0 IJM Generally, low N:P ratios in whole-lake, mesocosms and laboratory studies produce cyanobacteria dominance (Home & Commins, 1987; Vrede et. al., 2009; Zevenboom, 1982; Zevenboom et. al., 1982). Lake cyanobacteria N-fixation become favourable with N:P ratios lower than 16:1 and total inorganic N concentrations ofless than 3.6-7.1 jJM (Home & Commins, 1987; Vrede et. at., 2(09). Often participating as an asscessory algae in phytoplankton communities, green algae dominance is defined by their adaptive strategies to endure unique aquatic niches instead of competiting against phytoplankton for limited nutrient resources. For example, filamentous Spyrogyra sp. may anchor to

41

-

shallow and turbulent lake areas where phytoplankton generally wash away (Hainz et. al., 2009; Hoshaw & McCourt, 1988; Umrath, 1941).

1.6 Differences in Buoyancy and Sinking Rates of Different Phytopla nkton
Differing plankton buoyancy may be advantageous during low nutrient situations, as cells may increase its nutrient uptake by migrating towards nutrient rich environments within the water column (Britton & Timm, 1993; Ebert et. al., 2001; Fennel & Boss, 2003; Kolokolnikovet. al., 2009; Shigesada & Okubo, 1981). Phytoplankton population is controlled by nutrient limitations, seasonal temperature, and light gradients in the water column. Internal loading of nutrients from sediment results in concentrations highest below the thermocline in the mid-late summer, while light decreases with depth. Phytoplankton that can maintain buoyancy are often found in greatest density near the thermocline where they optimize growth by balancing light and nutrient availability. A phenomenon then occurs, known as the deep chlorophyll maximum, when both gradients (light and nutrients) intersect at mid-water column. In subtropical and tropical oceanic environments, the chlorophyll maximum is around 100 m depth. Lake water has a shallower chlorophyll maximum as light penetration is much more turbid and internal loading of nutrients delivers nutrients to the thermocline. Within a shallow lake with sufficient light and moderate temperature, most phytoplankton biomass grows near the surface with a continuous population sinking towards the bottom (Kolokolnikov et. al.· 2009).

42

Phytoplankton groups may differ in buoyancy. In green algae, the carbon storage product (starch) induces cell sinking, whereas the energy storage product in diatoms (Le. lipids) can create positive cell buoyancy. Euphotic zone nutrient depletion may decrease lipid production allowing an increased lipid degradation via metabolic B-oxidation to occur causing diatoms to be less buoyant (Wilhelm et. al., 2006). Diatom buoyancy may also be diminished by the uptake of silicates from the water column that increases frustule density. Depending on the amount of DSi converted to diatom BSi, a protective protein coat (frustule protection) may be formed and possibly slow down sinking rates with greater coating as it becomes degraded by environmental shearing (Sommer & Stabel, 1983). During stages of growth, diatom sinking rates could be at 0.3 to 3 m d- 1 or the end of their living cycle at 1 to 10 m d- 1, or over 100 m d- 1 in winter when larger diatom cells sink rapidly out of marine euphotic zones (D'Asaro, 2008). Intracellular gas vesicles that contain oxygen maintain buoyancy in cyanobacteria (Kinsman et. aI., 1991). Certain cyanobacteria are able to actively control their buoyancy by changing their cellular carbohydrates (Bormans & Condie, 1997). Other morphological adaptations may reduce sinking in various phytoplankton. For example. production of chitin fibres in the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii increases drag and reduces sinking rates (Durkin et. aI., 2009). Exterior algal formations of spines, fibres and mucus secretions may also reduce sinking rate. With other cases, algae sedimentation occurs regardless of adaptive advantages as is with the interaction of ph)10plankton and calcite precipitation. Known as whiting events in Lake Ontario. rapid sedimentation proceeds as calcite crystals aggregates with phytoplankton algae and bacteria (GaIman et. al.· 2008). Typically, the larger the ph)10plankton size. the greater

43

the sinking rate (Smayda, 1970), although as a whole, phytoplankton sinking rates (-0.4 to >2.2 m datI) may be determined by cell or colony density rather than phytoplankton sizes «10 to > 1000 urn) as shown in the Dutch coastal zone of the North Sea (Peperzak

I {

et. al., 2003).
Relevant to this thesis, diatoms and green algae are expected to sink more rapidly than cyanobacteria, resulting in greater export of organic matter (including organic N) to sediments. Diatoms and green algae are typically larger than cyanobacteria and have greater density due to carbohydrate storage product (green algae) or luxuriant Si uptake (diatoms). Nutrient loading conditions that favour diatoms and green algae relative to cyanobacteria would facilitate this transport of organic matter to sediments. This, in tum, could alter nitrogen cycling if nitrogen is recycled primarily in the water column (cyanobacteria dominated system) versus in the sediment (diatom or green algae dominated system). It should be noted that luxuriant Si uptake by diatoms may be a shortterm. Diatom populations may adapt to high Si levels and uptake may exhibit saturationtype kinetics over time (Thamatrakoln & Hildebrand, 2008). Therefore, nutrient loading conditions that specifically favour green algae may have the greatest long-term effect on nitrogen transport to sediments.

1.7. Research Rationale and Approach
The majority of studies on nitrogen biogeochemistry are conducted under marine conditions with some findings carrying over to freshwater knowledge. Most commonly these studies have been carried out in microcosms, using sediment cores or sediment slurries. However, generalizations from controlled microcosm experiments can be

44

challenging to extrapolate to field conditions as scale of experimental systems can strongly influence outcome (Petersen & Hastings, 2001; Petersen et. aZ., 2003). An important aspect of this thesis is that research in microcosms was repeated in field mesocosms to determine if results were scale dependent. Past studies of controls on denitrification have focused on N-form assessments (i.e. NOx, NH", +. N 20, N 2) and manipulated experimental conditions have attempted to directly explain denitrification rates (Balderston et. al., 1976; Goering & Dugale, 1966; Kana, et. al. 1994; Laursen & Seitzinger, 2002; Meyer et. al., 200 1; Nielsen, 1992; Risgaard-Petersen, 2003; Seitzinger, 1988) on occasion relating N:P, C:N, and Si:N aspects to individual lake organisms (Le. algae, bacteria, macrophytes, and invertebrates) (8ykova et. al., 2006; Hopfensperger, et. aI, 2009; Ishida et. al., 2008; Koho et. aI., 2008; Uikanen & Martikainen, 2003; Ragueneau et. al., 2002; Silvennoinen et. al., 2008) or food web stfllcture to denitrification (Hansen & Kristensen, 1998; Mermillod-Blondin et.

al., 2()()..t; Welsh, 2003). There is a fundamental need to address the subtle influences of
nutrient mtios on phytoplankton community as a whole and how they affect
denitritk~ltion

rJ.tes and nitrous oxide production in a controlled microcosm and field

mesocosm set of experiments. Rt'Cent denitrification studies have focused on sediment microcosm enclosures that involve the peril'ldiC subsampling of dissolved gases in water above the sediment. Microcosm Sl'tups may either reconJ N2 nu.'{ measurement within static incubation enclosures (Cornwell et.

enclosures to remove background dinitrogen gas (Seitzinger et. al., 1983; Seitzinger. 1988). Preincubation difficulties may include bottle effects produced by extended degassing periods and sediment sample decoupling from water column nitrate and carbon flow (Nowicki, 1994; Seitzinger et. al., 1993), Steady state microcosms ideally run less than 12 hours at about 50% oxygen saturation to reduce oxygen effects on the nitrification/denitrification processes (Groffman et. al. 2006; Jenkins & Kemp, 1984). Studies have showed that denitrification may be influenced by various environmental factors: organic carbon availability (Arango & Tank, 2008; Klump et. al., 2009; Pfenning & McMahon, 1997), nitrogen availability (Bernot et. aI., 2006; Martin et. at., 2001; Royer et. ai., 2004), substrate type (Groffman et. ai., 2006; Hopfensperger et. ai., 2009; Porter et. at., 2006) and periphyton community (Heggie et. ai., 2008; Smith et. ai., 2007). However, microcosms encompass small sediment volumes and it is difficult to replicate the natural physical environment of lakes in microcosms, making it difficult to extrapolate results from microcosm experiments to real ecosystems. In general, mesocosms, depending on experimental intentions, allow natural irradiation exposure, seasonal temperature and rain event effects, and gas exchange. Mesocosms have a larger volume than microcosms, encompass a greater sediment surface area, and do a better job replicating the physical environment being studied. Results from mesocosms may be easier to extrapolate to natural systems, although this comes at a cost in experimental control. Aquatic systems are particularly susceptible to environmental variability and may not respond consistently with in-lab microcosm results. For example, seasonal light exposure may intensify microbial competition, and wind disturbances promote lake mixing that may increase phytoplankton diversity. Discrepancies between

46

microcosmlmesocosm studies were also found to include differing algal material, incubation temperatures, and the use of single versus double exponential decay models (Foree & McCarty, 1970; Gillman et.

at., 2008; Jewell & McCarty,

1971; Lehmann et.

at.,

2(02). Also, area specific nitrification/denitrification processes in aquatic systems may be patchy, and microcosms may capture hot spots or cold spots, whereas mesocosms integrate more surface area and rates measured are more likely to reflect natural rates.

1.8 Hypotheses
The research presented in this thesis was designed to test two primary hypotheses, each with three related sub-hypotheses. The research made use of both microcosm and mesocosm experiments to take advantage of greater experimental control offered by microcosms, and greater represention of natural systems offered by mesocosms. Results of microcosm experiments reflect potential response to changes in elemental loading ratios, while results from mesocosm experiments reflect the more likely responses in a more complex system.

Hypothesis I: An increase in Si:N relative to Redfield ratio will cause an increase in
diatom abundance relative to other photoautotrophs.

,

Hypothesis la: An increase in diatom abundance relative to other
photoautotrophs will result in greater sinking of organic matter to sediment.

Hypothesis Ib: An increase in organic matter deposition will increase
denitrification.

Hypothesis Ie: An increase in organic matter deposition will increase N!O
production and evasion from mesocosms.

47

Hypothesis 2: An decrease in N:P relative to Redfield ratio would result in a relative increase in phytoplanktonic cyanobacteria. Hypothesis 2a: An increase in Cyanobacteria abundance relative to other photoautotrophs will result in less sinking of organic matter to sediment. Hypothesis 2b: A decrease in organic matter deposition will decrease denitrification. Hypothesis 2c: A decrease in organic matter deposition will decrease NzO production.

2. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Microcosm Experiment
General denitrification examination under microcosm setup is not representative of the absolute environmental values that the setup is simulating, but instead indicates the relative sediment chemical change of these conditions (Liikanen et. aI., 2002). Although stagnation is brought about by the slow water turnover and the gradual gas gradient, microbial interaction associated with nutrient ratio proceeds to influence denitrification rates.

2.1.1 Microcosm Experimental Setup
Microcosms contained silica sand (- 7-8 cm depth) in 1.85 L straight-sided glass jars (8 cm diameter, 20 cm depth). Sand substrate was chosen because it was more conducive for microbial activity than the less porous clay sediment with pockets having limited nutrients and moisture. Denitrification rates in sandy sediments may have a greater value than those in muddy sediment, and may have a greater potential for observation (Ehrenhauss et. al., 2004; Mermillod-Blondin et. al., 2002; Rust et. al., 2000). However, there have been numerous studies on substrate effects on denitrification and the results are equivocal. Sometimes sandy sediment seems to have a higher rate, where other occasions, silty sediment seems to have a higher rate. In a cross-system comparison, there was no systematic difference in rates (Seitzinger & Giblin, 1996). Nutrient-rich water was continually pumped through a peristaltic pump and delivered via a glass pipe into each microcosm in which the end was positioned 3 cm above the sediment surface. Glass microcosms were assumed inert with a minimal effect on silica loading (through leaching)
(

(

and silica dissolution from sand likely constituted the majority of the background silica in

this experiment. All microcosms were contained in a single water bath to maintain a relatively stable daily temperature (20-23°C over the experimental period). Experimental duration simulated was 3 months (August - November 2007). Fluorescent lights were maintained on a 14: 10 light:dark cycle mimicking summer photoperiod. Light intensity was 60 to 80 !lmol m,2 S'I at the water surface. The experimental design consisted of six different nutrient treatment combinations of Si:N (high = 2: 1, low 0.5:1) and N:P (high

5:1). These ratios are within the range of measured nutrient ratios in freshwater systcms. Nitrogen loading to each microcosm was constant (200 !lmol N mesocosm" d"), while Si and P loading varied among treatments (Table 2-1). Each treatment maintained four microcosm trials (Figure 2-1) that allowed for a 20% total volume nutrient renewal (370

(Appendix A, Part D), with concentrations of N, P, and Si modified to deliver target nutrient loading rates. Autoc1aved nutrient stocks solutions were continually pumped by a multichannel peristaltic pump from 20L carboys (Figure 2-2). Simulating an open water system, gas exchange was allowed through the opening at the top where exccss nutrients overflowed into the water bath reservoir. Physical disturbances were kept to a minimal ali the microcosms were left to establish microbial communities.

2.1.2 Microcosm Maintenance
Nutrient stock for each nutrient trial was replenished every week in each carboy, maintaining a nutrient media excess of l00ml to compensate for leaks, pump variation, and condensation within the interior carboy walls. Iron within the CHU-IO media periodically precipitated as a red layer at the bottom of the carboy. Iron resuspension involved the gentile mixing of the carboy within its immediate area and during media

renewal. Periodically, connecting tubes were cleared of algae and trapped air bubbles by removing and flushing lines with distilled water before reconnection. Microcosm flow rate gradually slowed down and was intermittently adjusted to maintain the 15 - 20% volume renewal per day.

2.1.3 Microcosm Setup
Treatment carboys were arranged in random order against a supporting wall, and equally spaced below a fluorescent light source producing all UV-spectra required for plant maintenance. Silica sand was washed repeatedly (minimum of 2 washes) with distilled water to remove floating particulates and was allowed to stand for 24 hours to permit air bubbles to settle out. Sand was then placed in each microcosm to a 1.5 cm depth and a height of 2.5 em from the nutrient glass capillary. Although there is some evidence that would suggest that benthic algae may be able to metabolize Si02 from sand grains (Lewin, 1955), Carrick and Lowe (2007) analyzed algal growth with substrates containg silica and without and found that there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between each sediment. However, algal biomass was greater under silica supported substrate where it may be used to emphasize microbial population and adequately simulate lake environments. Polyethylene tubing connecting to the water system (carboys, peristaltic pump, and microcosms) was filled with distilled water upon tube connection, which was also submerged in water to prevent air bubble entry that could disrupt flow. Watec flow rates were adjusted using the peristaltic pump adjustment control and fine adjustment for each individual microcosm with a four-way channel splitter that contained a fine knob adjustment for each port.

2.1 .2 Microcosm Maintenance
Nutrient stock for each nutrient trial was replenished every week in each carboy, maintaining a nutrient media excess of lOOml to compensate for leaks, pump variation, and condensation within the interior carboy walls. Iron within the CHU -10 media periodically precipitated as a red layer at the bottom of the carboy. Iron resuspension involved the gentile mixing of the carboy within its immediate area and during media

51

renewal. Penodically, connecting tubes were cleared of algae and trapped air bubbles by removing and flushing lines with distilled water before reconnection. Microcosm flow rate gradually slowed down and was intermittently adjusted to maintain the 15 - 20% volume renewal per day.

2.1.3 Microcosm Setup
Treatment carboys were arranged in random order against a supporting wall, and equally spaced below a fluorescent light source producing all UV -spectra required for plant maintenance. Silica sand was washed repeatedly (minimum of 2 washes) with distilled water to remove floatmg particulates and was allowed to stand for 24 hours to permit air bubbles to settle out. Sand was then placed in each microcosm to a 1.5 em depth and a height of 2.5 em from the nutrient glass capillary. Although there is some evidence that would suggest that benthic algae may be able to metabolize Si02 from sand grains (Lewin, ] 955), Carrick and Lowe (2007) analyzed algal growth with substrates containg silica and without and found that there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between each sediment. However, algal biomass was greater under silica supported substrate where It may be used to emphasize microbial population and adequately simulate lake environments. Polyethylene tubing connecting to the water system (carboys, peristaltic pump, and microcosms) was filled with distilled water upon tube connection, which was also submerged in water to prevent air bubble entry that could disrupt flow. Water flow rates were adjusted using the peristaltic pump adjustment control and fine adjustment for each individual microcosm with a four-way channel splitter that contained a fine knob adjustment for each port. A 24 hour flow through of all water (distilled) filled carboys

52

was perfonned to ensure a constant rate before another 24 hour flow through was perfonned with the actual experimental nutrient treatments. Microbial inoculum was added without nutrient loading, sequentially to all microcosms. After 2 hours for settling time, nutrient flow commenced. This was done to prevent washout immediately after inoculation. A dilute bleach solution was added to the water bath to prevent algal growth from occurring within the water bath.

2.1.4. Microbial Inoculation
The algal community was selected to represent the Great Lakes microbial community (Figure 2-3): diatoms (i.e. Navicula pelliculosa, Fragilaria crotonensis, & Aulacoseira sp.), cyanobacteria (i.e. Nostoc sp. & Anabaena sp.), and green algae (Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Spirogyra sp.). Navicula pelliculosa is a common diatom within freshwater bodies as this genus has the greatest recorded taxa (Kociolek, 2005), whereas Fragilaria crotonensis, & Aulacoseira sp are commonly found in eutrophic lakes (Moos et. at., 2009). Notably, Chlorella may potentially produce N20 (Weathers, 1984). Most cultures were obtained from Ward's Scientific (St. Catharines, ON). Fragilaria crotonensis and Aulacoseira sp. cultures were obtained through University of Toronto Culture Collection of Algae and Cyanobacteria (UTCC), now the Canadian Phycological Culture Centre. Algae and cyanobacteria were cultured using CHU-lO media (Stein, 1973), modified according to J. Acreman (UTCC). All media was sterilized and cultures were transferred aseptically. Algal suspensions were maintained on a mixing table under a fixed light source (fluorescent grow lights) that simulated

53

scheduled an 8-hour daylight exposures. Algal concentrations were comparable to seasonal trends (i.e. spring and sununer) of the Great Lakes.

2.1.5 Gas Measurements
Chemical analyses included N0 3-, dissolved silica, ortho-phosphate, NH/, and total organic carbon (TOC) as illustrated in figure 2-4. Oxygen and nitrous oxide probes were calibrated using two-point calibrations. Initially, distilled water at room temperature was

55

moderately sparged with air by an air bubbler in a beaker (-20 minutes). The signals (in pA) for 100% oxygen and nitrous oxide saturation were recorded for each probe. The beaker was then sparged with N2 for - 20 minutes and the signals for 0% oxygen and nitrous oxide saturation were recorded. The temperature of this water standard was also taken to convert probe measurements from pA to )lM concentrations. Dissolved oxygen and nitrous oxide concentrations were measured using microsensors (Unisense AlS, Aarhus, Denmark). Preliminary microcosm gas preparation involved turning the light source off during the day for about 30 minutes, before turning the light on and recording gas values. Microsensors were submerged mid-depth for about 5-10 seconds until readings were stabilized before recording the next adjacent microcosm. The light cycle was recorded first (estimated at about 5 minutes to record all microcosm readings) before the lights were turned off where the dark cycle readings were recorded for the same duration. Conditions affecting gas exchange across the air-water interface (e.g. temperature, pressure, air circulation) were assumed constant across all microcosms, and gas flux was estimated according to: Flux

=k(measured concentration 02

equilibrium concentration)
1 )

where flux is measured in mmol

or N m- 2 h- 1, k is a piston velocity (units of m h3 ·

and

gas concentrations have units of mmol 02 or N m-

Equilibrium gas concentrations are

calculated based on water temperature (Weiss, 1970; Weiss & Craig, 1973; Weiss & Price, 1980). Piston velocity is estimated from an empirical wind velocity-piston velocity relationship (Laursen & Seitzinger, 2005), using a wind velocity of 0 m S-I. Respiration, net primary production, and net N20 production were determined based on changes in

56

dissolved gas concentrations through time under constant conditions (e.g. measurements 3 hours apart under dark conditions or light conditions), and correcting for flux.

2.1.6 Organic Carbon
At the end of the 3 month experiment, water column samples were drawn from the midregion of the water column and examined for their Total Organic Carbon content by the Shimadzu TOC-V (serial #: HS 1104285065) analyzer and total organic content by the standard Ash technique. Water columns samples were collected on site and stored at freezing. Water samples were thawed later and examined by the TOC analyzer. Samples were drawn into the analyzer by a carrier gas (150 mllmin flowrate) into a combustion tube containing an oxidation catalyst and then heated to 680°C. As a result, carbon dioxide is formed from the burnt total carbon in the sample. The revenants of this sample are swept from the combustion tube to an electronic dehumidifier where it becomes dehydrated and cooled. After passing through a halogen scrubber, the carbon dioxide becomes quantified by a non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, 200 1). Whereas, the latter procedure required 50mL water samples to be filtered through a pre-combusted Whatman GFIF syringe filter. The filter was dried, weighed, and ashed at 500°C for 24 hours to remove organics. The final mass was used to determine the organic content as mass lost on ignition.

2.2 Mesocosm Experiment
Small microcosm are acceptable for small scale variability due to their small sediment surface area, however, error values might extrapolate to larger scale problems. A small surface area may also limit water column microbial flock and biofilm formation that are

57

associated with late spring/summer ecosystem behaviour. Mesocosm setup (large scale microcosms, Figure 2-6) was carried out the following summer in order to coincide with environmental and temporal events experienced by local lake water bodies. This mesocosm framework was based on the microcosm setup of the previous summer. Mesocosm nutrient loading ratios were to follow the same nutrient ratio regime as the microcosm experiment, although loading rates were reduced for better representation of loading to natural systems (Table 2-2) (Cook et. at., 2009; Downing & McCauley, 1993; Schindler et. aI., 2008; Turner, 2002). This was modified by removing the high N:P treatments, as microcosm experiments found no differences in oxygen consumption, production, or net N20 production between high N:P (25:1) and middle-range N:P (15:1). Therefore, the mesocosm experimental design was restricted to 4 different treatments with triplicate mesocosms for each treatment for a total of 12 mesocosms at each location. Mesocosm chambers consisted of cylindrical plastic drums of equal size (50.8 cm diameter, 96.52 cm height, 163 L volume) arranged in random order in an open field. Two duplicate runs of this 12 mesocosm setup were conducted in two different field sites: Markham region and City of Hamilton. Water exchange (10% volume replacement) was conducted after weekly samples were collected. Water was removed from mesocosms and replaced with municipal tap water (Markham mesocosms) or with pond water (Stoney Creek mesocosms). The Stoney Creek mesocosms, then, had a continuous reinoculation with aquatic microorganisms, including algae and cyanobacteria. The experiment was conducted over an 8 week period in August and September of 2008.

Silica sand was added to mesocosms, covering the bottom of each drum to a depth of -10 cm. Sand was washed several times to eliminate floating particles and debris. Silty sediment was collected from Christie Lake in Dundas, ON using an Ekman dredge. This sediment was added to the mesocosms to a depth of - 3 cm, providing finer particles, organic matter, and natural microbial inoculum. Mesocosms were filled with municipal tap-water. Mesocosms were assigned trial treatments and were randomized on the experimental field. Mesh was fitted at the opening to limit access by mosquitoes while still allowing gas exchange and light penetration. Mesocosms were allowed to settle for one week to allow silt to settle, stratification to begin, and the release of trapped air bubbles before nutrient loading began. Within the first 24 hours, sediment traps (two per mesocosm) that consisted of a 50ml centrifuge tube were deployed at the bottom of each mesocosm (Figure 2-5). They were inserted in sediment and later collected using a rod with a centrifuge cap glued to the end. Each centrifuge tube contained 2-3 marbles to prevent floating. In theory, a dense periphyton layer will accumulate during experimental operation and will add to benthic organic content and sediment microbial community present.

2.2.1 Weekly Sampling of Mesocosms
Nutrients were replenished within each mesocosm by removing 10% of the water column and replacing it with municipal tap water (Markham) or pond water (Stoney Creek), and adding nutrients from stock solutions. Water column samples were collected using a siphon tube and gravity filling of sample vessels. Water samples were collected from mid-depth. Samples for nutrient analyses (50 rnl) were filtered (Whatman GFIF) and frozen before nutrients were replenished in mesocosms in order to assess the previous week's conditions. Water samples were taken from the water supplies used for volume replacement (tap and pond water) as well as precipitation whenever rain events occurred during the week. Precipitation measurements were based on Pearson AirportlButtonville Airport and Hamilton Airport, for Markham and Hamilton areas respectively. Volumes of water exchanged and concentrations of nutrients in water exchanged (by replacement,

60

nutrient amendment, and rainfall) were used to calculate actual nutrient loading to mesocosms. Samples for N 2 0 were processed by the gentle gravity filling of 10 ml water sample, IOto a syringe, from the siphon tube. The sample was transferred immediately into a 20 ml serum bottle previously flushed with N2 (minimum 20 volumes flushed). This serum bottles were then vigorously shaken to equilibrate the gas between the water sample and the headspace. After 5 minutes of shaking, a syringe was used to withdraw 10
ml of gas was and transfer it to an N 2-flushed exetainer. Samples for dissolved O 2 , N 2,

and Ar were collested by gentle gravity filling of exetainers, inserting the siphon tube into the bottom of the exetainer and allowing three volumes to overflow the exetainer before removing the tube. Samples were preserved by pipetting in concentrated ZnCh solution to a final concentration of 0.5% volume/volume (20 ilL into 4 ml water sample). Exetainers were capped, taking care to avoid trapping bubbles, and were stored under water in a refrigerator. Temperature readings were recorded by using a temperature probe at mid-depth in the water column. Temperature was used to determine headspace equilibrium for N 2 0 analyses and to determine theoretical gas equilibrium concentrations. Gases were analyzed as described below.

2.2.2 Mesocosm Location
Summer mesocosms were located in two different locations: Markham township and Hamilton region. Separate locations determined if differing water supply, continuous versus one-time direct inoculum with aquatic microorganisms, and geographical location in field were causative factors that would influence biogeochemistry and phytoplankton community structure. Temporal seasonal effects and general geographical location were shared between the two experimental sites.

61

2.2.2.1 Markham
Markham is a township north of the city of Toronto. The municipal water codes comply with the Ontario Drinking Water System Regulation. Under Ontario Regulation 170/03, water samples are collected by provincially approved York-Durham regional environmental laboratories certified with Waterworks licences. Tested drinking water from all water municipalities maintained a consistent amount of nitrite and nitrate levels that were 0.010 mg/L and 0.590 mgIL respectively (The Corporation of the Town of Markham Annual Regulatory Water Quality Report, 2008).

2.2.2.2 Turtle Pond
Situated in Stoney Creek (municipality of Hamilton), Turtle pond is a small (- 10 ha) flood basin pond of Lake Ontario. The pond is shallow (- 1.3 m) with very turbid water. Turtle pond experiences frequent blooms of cyanobacteria during the summer and autumn.

2.3 Organic Carbon and Sediment Analysis
Water column organics were measured by collecting 250ml water samples. Within 24 hours, suspended organics were collected by vacuum filtration and filters (pre-combusted
GFIF) were dried, weighed, and combusted at 500°e. Ashed filter were reweighed to

determine mass lost on ignition (organjc fraction ). Sediment trap and ediment core were collected by gently draining the mesocosms (siphon tubes) until les than 20 cm water depth was present. Sediment cores were collected using a centri fuge tube with the end cut off, fonning an open barrel that could be inserted and then capped to maintain

62

suction while the core was removed. Three sediment cures were collected from each mesocosm (random locations), transferred to a plastic jar, and homogenized as a composite sample. Sediment samples were stored at -20°e. Sediment core and sediment samples were used for organic carbon analysis (combustion as above) and phytopigment analysis .

2.4 Chemical and Gas Analysis
2.4.1 N2 , O 2 , and Ar - Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry
Dissolved gas samples were drawn from the mid-region water column of each mesocosm via siphnning from a Tygon tube into a 5mJ glass vial. Gentle water transfer was maintained until vial overflow to ensure that air bubbles were not formed and that water samples were not degassed. A supersaturated ZnCh solution was added to the water sample and was encapsulated allowing no air bubbles to be trapped inside. This was perfomled to preserve the gaseous content within the water sample and to prevent the metabolic breakdown of the gas. Samples were refrigerated for storage instead of frozen to prevent degassing. Samples were analyzed for N 2 , O 2 , and Ar using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) (Kana et. al., 1994, 1998). With high N2 background associated with gas analysis, MIMS becomes an appropriate gas technique as it measures N2 directly under in situ conditions. Gas ratios (N 2:Ar and 02:Ar) are measured by mass spectrometry as ratios can be measured with much greater precision «0.05% CV among replicates) than direct measurement of individual gases. Ar is a non-reactive, relatively abundant gas and is generally assumed present at 100% saturation with respect to

63

temperature.

N 2 and

O 2 can then be calculated from measured gas ratios assumi ng Ar to

he at equilibrium. The instrument was standardized u~ing a gently and continu ously mix d di still d water sample, held in a water bath and equilibrated for several hours. Th standard wa.' assumed to be at lOU% saturation with respect to all th ree gases at the temp rature of the water bath. Measured ratios in the c:;tandard were normali zed to theoreti cal gas ratios at equilibrium (Weiss , 1970). This nurmalizati on was appli ed to rati o<; measured in gas samples to detennine in situ gas ratios.
N2

and O2 were then calculated from ratios

Samples were first drawn in the M IMS by a peri staltic pump where gall molecules fro m thi water sample were then wept through a semi-permeable microbore silicone membrane by an internal turbomolec ular vacuum p ump. The ga<; <;ample wa<; drawn into a loop in erted into a liq uid nitrogen trap to capture water vapour and carbon dioxide from the main gas tream . The remaining N 2, O 2, and Ar are detected by a quadrapole mass pe trometer. Using Ar as the inert internal <;tandard,

64

betwe n inlet and outlet water, flow ratc and core surface area produce a more dynamic nutrient ffect than steady-state conditions . However, batch trials may require a more complicated setup that may run for several days or weeks. Microcosm studies have identified the positive influence of algal and bacterial community (i.e. structure and biomass) on benthic periphyton . Microphytobenthos and henthic bactelia may be compared within these sediment deposits. By alternating periphyton characteristics
~e.g.

nutrient load, sediment substrate, redox potential, etc), sediment

denitrification rates will be affected (Ishida et. at., 2008). Although stagnation is brought about by the slov.· water turnover and the gradual gas gradient, microbial interaction associated with nutrient ratio proceeds to influence denitrification rates.

2.4.2 Ammonia Assay
The combination of anunonia sample with hypochlorite and indophenol reagents forms a hlue colour that is analyzed using a UV -Vis spectrometer. This phenol reaction is catal zed by sodium nitroprusside. Analysis was conducted using a UV -Vis spectrometer at 640nrn. Protocol details are as listed in Appendix A. part A.l (Greenberg et. al., 1999; Solarzano, 1969).

2.4.3 Nitrate Assay
itrate analysis was performed by running prepared samples through a cadmium column that quantitatively reduces nitrate to nitrite. A peristaltic pump was used to maintain constant flow. This nitrogen union with sulphanilarnide and N-(l-napthyl)eth lenediarnine dihydrochloride creates an azo-dye that is a vibrant pink colour. Sample concentration are determined through UV spectroscopy at 543nm. Protocol details are as

65

listed in Appendix A. part A.2 (Methods for chemical analysis of waler and wastes. 1979; Greenberg et. al. , 1999; Wood el. ul., 1967).

2.4.4 Ortho-Phosphate Assay
The ascorbic acid method was us~d to determine dissolved orthophosphate (phosphorus) concentrations. A molybdenum blue is developed with reducti on of heteropholy acid (phosphomolybdic acid) frum the reaction of amm onium molybdate and potassium antimonyl tartrate with orthophosphate in the presence. Molybdenum blue intensity is reciprocal to orthophosphate concentration, which is analyzed under the UV -Vis pectrometer at 880nm. Protocol details are as listed in Appenilix A. part A.3 (Edwards et.
ai., 1965; Greenberg et. 01., 1999; Murphy & Riley, 1962).

2.4.5 Dissolved Silica Assay
The mo\ybdo ilicate method was used for Si0 2 analysis. In this assay, silica and pho ph ate are reacted with ammonium molybdate (pH 1.2) to form heteropoly acids. The phosphate aspect (molybdophosph oric acid) is eliminated with the addition of oxalic acid leaving the molybdo il icic acid intact. A yell owish colour is produced in proportion to molybdosilicici acid content and is read at 410 nm using the UV -Vis spectrometer. The
detailed nutrient assay was based on wa')tewater treatment standards and are noted in

Appendix A, part AA (Eaton el. ai., 1995; Greenberg et. ai., 1999).

2.4.6 GC-ECD
Perkin Elmer

20 Analysis

utosystem XL gas chromatography was instal1ed with a Supe1co Plot

1010 column for sample analysis. A hydrogen gas carrier gas was used at a flow rate of

66

45.0 mllmin with a general air flowrate at 450.0 mllmin. The split ratio was set a default of zero reading and was adjusted according to the gas pressure. The oven temperature was set on a 35°C isothermal temperature program. Samples were injected at a injector temperature of 185°C with sample detector temperature set at 200°C. Protocol details are as listed in Appendix A. part B.

2.5 Microbial Analysis 2.5.1 Lugol Sample/Light Microscopy
Microbial community is monitored individually or as individuals of a whole community. Microbial samples were stored using lugol iodine solution. The Lugol solution consisted of 109 potassium iodide and 5g iodine for every 100mI water mixture. Two Lugol samples were taken at a mid-intermediate period (established community) and near the termination of the experiment (community maturity). Characterization was accomplished by identification through a light microscope and then numerated based on haemocytometer counts that determined microbial cell density.

2.5.2. Phytopigmentation Analysis
Mesocosm sediment cores and sediment traps would be sent to DHI organisation (independent, international and research organisation) for phytopigmentation analysis which is approved and controlled by the Danish Accreditation Scheme (DANAK). Samples will be stored in liquid nitrogen after being filtered onto GFIF filters. Upon analysis, samples will be analyzed by a Shimadzu LC-lOA HPLC system according to methodology described by Wright, et. al. (1991). Protocol details are as listed in Appendix A. part C.

67

2.6 Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were perfonned using SYSTAT (2008) software for PC computers. Repeated-measures analysis was used to assess differences in mesocosm nutrient (PO/!, Si, N0 3-, NH/) concentrations, microcosm TOC and TOM concentrations, N 2 0 and O2 microcosm readings, mesocosm %N2 saturation, and %0 2 saturation. The different microcosmlmesocosm assay results as stated were defined as experimental units, with N:P loading, N:Si loading, location effects were taken as the between-unit factors and the time, time x location, time x N:P, time x Si:P taken as the within-unit factors. The general linear model was perfonned on mesocosm inorganic nitrogen loss, mesocosm Si0 2 loss, and mesocosm PO/'- Joss.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Microcosm Experiment
After the initial two weeks of microbial inoculation, a consistent green colour from primary producers was visible throughout the 3-month experimental duration on the sediment surface. Benthic growth was visible in all microcosm trials (Figure 3-1); however, growth density was subject to nutrient loading regime, as a thin growth layer was present in low nutrient loading treatments, or when flow was disrupted due to tube blockage. Microbial growth consistency was re-established once nutrient flow continued (Figure 3-2). Gas concentrations were measured weekly using Unisense AJS dissolved oxygen and nitrous oxide micro sensors directly above the sediment in the water column (Figure 3-3).

3.1.1 Nitrous oxide production
ANOV A indicated different trends in nitrous oxide production between the light and dark cycles as shown in Figure 3-4 (a and b). Both Si:N and N:P loading ratios affected N2 0 production in the light, but only N:P affected N2 0 production in the dark (Table 3-1). Regarding P loading (figure 3-4), it would seem that nitrous oxide production during the light cycle generally increase with increasing P load (relative to N). For example. low Si:N = 0.5 and low N:P =5 initially produces -18 nmol N 20 m- 2 h- t and then decreases to 2 t -8 nmol m- h- N20 at Redfield N:P = 15 and at high Si:N = 2. Also, low N:P produces N20 -28 nmol m- 2 h- t (high Si:N, yellow bar, Figure 3-4 a.) that decreases to -10 nmol m- 2 h- t occuring at the high N:P ratio. High N:P, which should favour green algae over cyanobacteria, resulted in lower N20 production which is not consistent with hypothesis 2, 2a, and 2c. Increased Si:N loading on the other hand showed a general increase of nitrous oxide production at low N:P, but a reduction in N20 production at high N:P. Redfield N:P ratio showed the greatest difference between Si loading with -8nmol m- h-I N20 2 I produced at low Si:N = 0.5 in comparison to the high Si:N = 2 with -15 nmol m- h- N 20 produced. The effect of Si:N loading on N20 production was strongly dependent on N:P loading, as shown by significant Si x P interaction terms (p < 0.00 1 in light, p = 0.002 in dark) (Le. the tendency for high silica to increase N20 production was reversed where N:P was high). Increased N2 0 production with high silica loading at low N:P was consistent with hypothesis 1, and lc as the competitive balance was tipped from cyanobacteria more toward diatoms. The results of reduced N20 production at high N:P

are also consistent with the predictions of hypothesis 2, and 2c. While low N:P favours cyanobacteria, high N:P with low silica loading should favour green algae, which are generally denser than diatoms or cyanobacteria, and sink exporting carbon and organic N to sediments. High N:P with high silica loading should favour diatoms, which are less likely to sink than green algae due to carbon storage as lipids. This should reduce organic N export to sediments, and therefore N 20 production by denjtrificatioo.

Values of N 20 production in the dark cycle were generally lower in magnitude compared to their light cycle counterparts. Statistical evidence also showed that N 20 flux changed over time in both the light and dark situations, as indicated by the significant effect of date. Similar to other diural studies, overall dark nitrous oxide flux values were relatively lower than their light cycle counterparts, which would suggest a greater importance of autotrophic influence on denitrification processes during the day. Although nitrifiers are light sensitive, photosynthesized oxygen may increase the sediment oxic layer and support denitrification via coupling with nitrification (Risgaard-Petersen et. at., 2005; Rysgaard et. ai., 1994). As shown in figure 3-4b (dark conditions), denitrification may have become relatively less important in the dark.

3.1.2 Photosynthesis/Respiration
High silica loading relative to nitrogen consistently increased oxygen flux, both in light (Figure 3-5a) and in the dark (Figure 3-5b). Phosphorus loading (relative to nitrogen) had no effect on oxygen flux under light conditions, however increased P loading (relative to N) did increase oxygen consumption by sediments in the dark (p = 0.033) (Table 3-2). The increased loading of silica appears to have stimulated overall metabolic activity, perhaps by selecting for a more productive community of photosynthetic organisms, particularly diatoms. As discussed, diatom biomass will contribute to the periphyton layer with increasing Si:N loading. The potential for reducing agents (Le. organic carbon) within this layer may rise and possibly account for the increase in respiration rate with this shift in loading ratio.

3.1.3 Total Organic Carbon
Total organic carbon analysis of samples from the water column is a proxy for microbial biomass, and would be expected to correlate with phytoplankton biomass. Organic carbon decreased as phosphorus loading (relative to N loading) decreased (Figure 3-6; Table 3-3). However, as noted in the previous section, decreased P loading did not reduce oxygen production during the day. This suggests that either community with high N:P loading is more productive. per unit biomass, or that much of the production in these communities is benthic. The latter possibility would also be consistent with expectations of hypothesis 2a. However. total organic matter (TOM) in sediments did not increase with higher N:P loading (Table 3-4; Figure 3-7) as would be expected from hypothesis 2b. Further. sediment TOM decreased with increased Si:N loading, contrary to expectations from hypothesis 1b.

3.1.4 Community Composition Analysis
Preserved samples were characterised using light microscopy and cells were enumerated with a haemocytometer. Primary producers were identified by their size, cellular shape and internal membrane structure, which were visually enhanced by iodine staining characteristics of cellular components. Given that samples were seeded with eight morphologically distinct microphytes, identification of cells in mixed communities may potentially be relatively simple. Community composition was defined by the percent contribution of each type of microphyte to the mixed culture. lbese percentage contributions were used as the dependent variables in the MANDY A analysis. The MANDY A full model found that community composition did vary significantly among nutrient loading treatments and over time (Table 3-5; full model, p < 0.001). Silica loading (relative to N) did not have a significant effect on commnity composition (p = 0.449), however P loading (relative to N) did have a marginally significant effect on community composition (p =0.084). The temporal effect (p < 0.001), on the other hand, showed a significant difference between the initial results with those taken three months later. Generally, an increase in P loading relative to N resulted in a decrease in the relative abundance of green algae and an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria (Figure 3-8); consistent with hypothesis 2, and 2a. An increase in relative abundance of diatoms was expected with an increase in Si loading. This was not observed and diatoms were consistently a minor part of microphyte community composition. Small diatoms may be very difficult to observe and identify with general light microscopy (Le. not using phase contrast and sediment-free samples). It is likely that diatom abundance was under

77

reported. The results, while not supportive of the hypothesis that increased Si:N loading would favour diatom dominance, should not be taken as evidence against the hypothesis as there is extensive research supporting this issue (Carrick & Lowe, 2007; Schelske et. al., 1986,2006). Upon further statistical analysis, univariate F tests showed that Navicula (diatom, p < 0.001) and Nostoc (cyanobacteria, p

=0.032) were the genera that were most

responsive to treatment, and best explained the overall community response to different treatments. Considering that diatoms readily take up silica as part of their frustule structure and cyanobacteria can store large amounts of phosphorus in polyphosphate granules within their cells, microbial cultures of Navicula and Nostoc may be most effectively linked to alterations in Si:N and N:P. Again, Navicula were probably undercounted and the Nostoc results may be the most robust from this data set. Nostoc was sensitive to N:P loading and was greatly reduced in dominance when N:P loading increased to 25 (Figure 3-8). A comparison between panels (Figure 3-8a and 3-8b) showed that the green algae may have slowly increase in microcosms and become more dominate during the latter stages of the experiment. Although Spirogyra was inoculated into all microcosms, it was not detected in any September or December samples.

r

I "

It also appeared that the medium N:P loading (15:1) produced the lowest diatom
dominance as compared to the other N:P treatments that created relatively similar diatom abundance. Redfield nutrient ratio is ideal for general microbial growth and may create competition for resources in a limited spaced microcosm. For this reason, cyanobacteria and green algae may have a competitive advantage as their free-floating nature accesses a greater water surface area for nutrients in the water column over benthic diatoms. Low

r

78

flow conditions (5 cm/s average horizontal velocity) such as this microcosm setup would lead to buoyant cyanobacteria species (i.e. Anabaena) (Bormans & Condie, 1997). Nonetheless, the ability of diatoms to specifically utilize Si and its ease of buoyancy manipulation due to their relatively high surface area may give competitive advantages over other species under extreme N:P conditions. Regardless, cyanobacteria dominance was shown to be relatively consistent among microcosm nutrient loading regimes.

3.2 Mesocosm Experi ments
Large scale mesocosms were setup in outdoor fields of two locations, Markham and Hamilton, and simulated indoor microcosm parameters from the previous summer. Through statistical analysis of the microcosms it was concluded that there was no significant difference between the high N:P nutrient trial in comparison to the medium N:P (Redfield) nutrient ratio in terms of nitrous oxide and oxygen flux. Therefore, the high N:P loading ratio (25:1) was not included in mesocosm experiments. Altogether, there were 12 mesocosms for each location with 3 mesocosm trials for each nutrient loading treatment (N:P = 5, Si:N = 0.5; N:P = 5, Si:N = 2; N:P = 15, Si:N = 0.5; N:P = 15, Si:N == 2). All mesocosms were exposed to the local weather, surrounding temperature conditions and used the local water system for replacement (municipal water). The Hamilton mesocoms used nearby lake water (Turtle pond) as well as the local municipal water system for replacement, as described in the Methods section. The Hamilton mesocosms, then, had a continuous inoculation of pond microphytes over the course of the experiment. Summer conditions also brought up potential mosquito control problems. Mosquitoes were prevented from entering mesocosms by fixing net barriers on the mesocosm openings. Although large insect vectors were efficiently denied entry, smaller insects (Le. midges) were able to spawn within the Markham mesocosms. Removal by net sifting was the only means of eliminating such contaminants and can only account for visible, moving insect larvae. Barriers were only removed for sample collection and nutrient replacement each week.

3.2.1 Denitrification
A Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer (MIMS) at the University of Montreal was used to analyze water samples for dissolved N2 and O2 as described in the Methods section. Denitrification rates were not directly measured, but relative differences in denittification can be inferred from differences in saturation of water with respect to N 2. Similarly, differences in respiration can be inferred from differences in saturation of water with respect to O 2 .

ANOVA found that the only significant effect on %N2 saturation was the differing locations (p = 0.022) (Table 3-6). With a high denitrification rate, a greater degree of N2 product becomes saturated in the water column, hence an increase in %N2 saturation value. Hamilton mesocosms can be inferred to have had generally greater denitrification rates than Markham mesocosms (Figure 3-9).

Nutrient loading involving Si:N had a significant effect on Markham mesocosms as was shown in the high Si:N nutrient ratio trial that produced a greater oxygen staturation rate than the low Si:N trial. Hamilton mesocosm Si:N nutrient trials were comparable and showed no difference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High silica loading may have favoured a productive benthic periphyton layer dominated by diatoms in the Markham mesocosms, explaining the difference in % O 2 saturation during the day between Si:N loading regimes. However, phytopigment analysis of sediments must be completed to provide support for this.

3.2.3 Nitrous Oxide Production
Nitrous oxide production was not measured directly; however, differences in dissolved N 20 concentrations can be used to infer differences in net production. ANOVA results showed that experimental treatments (nutrient loading ratios) had no significant effects in mesocosm trials (Table 3-8). Nitrous oxide concentrations were shown to decrease with time (Figure 3-11), despite cooling of water, which would increase solubility. This suggests that net production rates decreased through the late summer into early autumn.

3.2.4 Nutrient Analysis
A general pattern for nutrient concentrations is that there is a significant difference between site locations and temporally. Nutrient assay results are categorized by location, according to Markham or Hamilton results. The nutrient and organic assays involved in this study were TOe, NH4+, N03- , Si, and P04-2 (Figure 2-4).

3.2.4.1 Water Column Total Organic Carbon (TOC)
Toe in mesocosm water samples was shown to vary between locations (Table 3-9). Mesocosms located in Hamilton generally had higher TOe concentrations on any given date than Markham mesocosms (Figure 3-12). Although TOe concentrations varied among dates within each location, there was no clear temporal pattern as seen for N20 concentrations, suggesting net carbon production was more temporally variable than net N20 production. Their periphyton layers may ultimately define mesocosm denitrification rates and sediment metabolism. Periphyton organic matter may act as an electron donor for utilization of heterotrophic bacteria including denitrifiers. Hamilton mesocosms (-7 TOe Ilg L- 1) generally have greater water column TOe content than Markham (-5 Toe Jlg L- 1) throughout experimentation, which may translate to more carbon available in the periphyton or sediment layers. This organic carbon availability could account for the higher % saturation of N2 and lower % saturation of O 2 seen in Hamilton mesocosms relative to Markham mesocosms.

3.2.4.4 Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen Loss
Possible inorganic nitrogen fates could be sediment burial, microbial biomass assimilation, and loss by denitrification (either directly or through coupled nitrification/denitrification). The lag growth of seeded microbial community in each mesocosm may be a probable explanation to initially high nutrient values. As the microbial community, including phytoplankton, matures and becomes established, more nutrients may be removed contributing to dissolved inorganic nitrogen loss. ANOV A results showed a significant difference in nitrogen loss from mesocosms based on location (Table 3-12). Loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonium + nitrate + nitrite) was generally greater from Hamilton than from Markham mesocosms. This was particularly true during the first four weeks of the experiment, with no difference between locations beyond week 5 (Figure 3-15). While loss could be attributed in part to burial or assimilation, the results are consistent with the higher % N2 saturation data and, taken together, suggest denitrification rates were not affected by nutrient loading ratios but were affected by location.

3.2.4.5 Silica
The Si:N loading ratio as well as time and location had a signficant effects on dissolved silica concentrations in mesocosms (Table 3-13). All mesocosms showed a general decrease in silica concentration with time. As expected, Si:N loading ratio of 2 consistently resulted in higher silica concentrations than Si:N loading of 0.5. Hamilton mesocosms generally had higher concentrations of silica than Markham mesocosms, and typically Hamilton mesocosms with Si:N loading of 0.5 had higher dissolved silica concentrations than Markham mesocosms with Si:N loading of 2 (Figure 3-16). Silica loss was also related to Si:N loading ratio (Table 3-14; Figure 3-17). Higher silica loading resulted in a greater rate of silica loss, perhaps by stimulating diatom growth and the silica uptake associated with these microphytes. Diatom-dominated communites would be expected to have high silica uptake. The loss of silica from all mesocosms, regardless of location and nutrient loading regime, may suggest a general movement toward dominance by diatoms in later summer to early autumn. That Markham mesocosms have lower silica may also suggest these mesocosms have generally greater diatom abundance. If this is the case, it might be consistent with hypothesis that a diatom dominated community (Markham) may export less carbon to sediments and have lower denitrification rates than green algae dominated communities (Hamilton), although the results of phytoplankton analysis in support of this is not yet available.

3.2.4.6 Phosphate
Ortho-phosphate concentrations were influenced by location and time according to the ANOVA results (Table 3-15). Hamilton mesocosms had generally higher concentrations of phosphate than Markham mesocosms (Figure 3-18). Phosphate concentrations decreased through time with concentrations in Hamilton mesocosms decreasing at a greater rate than Markham mesocosms. Interestingly, N:P loading ratio had no influence on phosphate concentrations. It should be noted that phosphate concentrations were consistently near the detection limit and patterns should be interpreted cautiously. ANOV A results showed a significant effect of N:P loading ratio and location on phosphorus loss in mesocosms (Table 3-16). Although P uptake decreased with time at both locations and for both N:P loading ratios, uptake under the low N:P loading regime (i.e. higher P loading) was of greater magnitude as might be expected (Figure 3-19). The decline in P uptake was sharper in Markham mesocosms than in Hamilton mesocosms, perhaps suggesting Markham mesocosms were more rapidly approaching a balance between primary production and remineralization.

3.3 Conclusions
3.3.1 Hypothesis 1: An increase in Si relative to Redfield ratio will cause an increase in diatom abundance relative to other photoautotrophs.
Diatom niches may uniquely improve their nutritional uptake of surrounding inorganic nitrogen under high Si:N load, relative to the Redfield ratio. Such an accumulation of silica by diatom frustules would suggest a competitive advantage over other photoautotrophs as silica is essential for diatom division, consequently improving their number and density. On the other hand, Iugol counts via light microscopy indicated the contrary as cyanobacteria became the dominate photoautotroph. This may be attributed to the physical constraints of contrasting microbes that may hinder microbe identification; as a result, diatom numbers were underestimated. This would support the use of phytopigment analysis, which would be implemented during succeeding mesocosm sediment analysis, where the results are not yet available. Microcosm nitrous oxide results supported this hypothesis as N20 increased with increased Si:N load. However, silica load may have induced a greater diatom population in the water column a'i sediment TOM accumulation declined under the low Si:N nutrient treatment. Mesocosm experiments experienced silica loss between experimental weeks, however. Si load was shown to have no significant difference between trials.

r
100

Hypothesis 1a: An increase in diatom abundance relative to other photoautotrophs will result in greater sinking of organic matter to sediment.

While the evidence leading towards a shift in microbial diatom dominance to other photoautotrophs (e.g. cyanobacteria and green algae) may be inconclusive, comparable mesocosm measurements using sediment traps, and organic C analysis of sediments (ashfree dry mass) may prove otherwise. Under similar high Si:N treatments, these mesocosms experienced an increased TOM (sediment organics) and DOC (water column organics) concentration, in association with elevated chlorophyll c (fucoxanthin diatom phytopigment) content (Mandrapilias, 2009).

Hypothesis 1b: An increase in organic matter deposition will increase denitrifica tion.
Mesocosms experienced an incline in percent N2 saturation within the water column that would indicate an improved denitrification rate throughout experimentation. Hamilton produced a greater denitrification rate (%N2 saturation) in comparison to Markham mesocosms, which may be directly linked to the benthic region where the periphyton layer is located. However, organic sediment analysis is pending. Analysis of specific dates apart from the averages calculated may yield promising results.

101

Hypothesis Ic: An increase in organic matter deposition will increase N 20 production and evasion from mesocosms.
Early microcosm experimentation showed evidence that high Si:N, in association with low N:P, results in a greater N 20 production, which would suggest that diatomaceous organic matter settled downwards to support the periphyton layer. However, this was not the case as microcosm TOM decreased with increased Si:N treatment, which would indicate that nitrous oxide production might not have been stimulated by silica-based organics. On the other hand, the larger scale mesocosms indicated that nutrient treatments showed no significant effects on nitrous oxide production, which could be attributed to the issue of scale, and experimental parameters that adequately represent environmental conditions. Mesocosms are inherently distorted representations of nature. Experimental scale may be an issue, as they are of short duration, subject to reduced biological material and energetic exchange, exposed temporal and spatial variability, simplification of complex physical and biological processes, prone to enclosure effects (large edge effects) which may compromise natural lake system results (Englund & Cooper, 2003; Schindler, 1998). Conversely, mesocosms allow for a greater degree of control, replication and repeatability than whole ecosystems or environmental plots (Kareiva, 1989; Kemp et. al., 1980). Peterson, et. al. (2005) explains that there must be functional similarity where experimental conditions, relationships and behaviours are made similar to nature in order to test hypothesis (Petersen & Englund, 2005). The problem of scale with respect to data collection, either from the microcosm parameters translated to the mesocosm setup, or the setups as a whole extrapolating their

r

r

r

102

findings to the environment, may be categorized as the microcosmlmesocosm spatial scale relative to their natural counterparts, their reduced temporal scale, and the degree of ecological complexity these containments are capable of simUlating. Experimental scale becomes an issue where results become significant (stable) with increasing mesocosm size as variability between trials decreases. However, there is a need to adjust variables (light penetration) influenced by scale since the ratio of edge perimeter to the internal mesocosm area decreases with increasing size (Petersen et. ai., 1999). The great strength of these mulitscale setups (microcosm and mesocosm) is that factors, such as nutrient load, may be constant so that specific variables under certain conditions may be directly extrapolated into natural systems without the issue of scaling effects. Peterson and Hastings (2001) and Langhaar (1951) had mentioned that these factors are significant aspects to a dimensional approach to mesocosm design that translates specific attributes of interest to larger environmental conditions. Temporal distortion between microcosm and mesocosm may not be an issue as both were conducted under a 3-month period, nonetheless, this brief period is only a small aspect of conditions lakes experience seasonally year after year. Yet, intimate biological and physical conditions present in microcosms may not translate well to larger scale mesocosms due to their lower ecological complexity. Mesocosms may undergo depth scale effects that may involve benthic-pelagic coupling (Hargrave, 1973; Oviatt et. al., 1986), primary production productivity (per unit area), and differences in light and gas flux per unit volume according to depth (Petersen et. al.. 1997). Due to this complexity, regions of data collection (Le. N20) from different depths within the mesocosm water column may be variable. Whereas, the small scale microcosm

103

may produce consistent results at depth at the cost of variable results between trials. Consequently, scaling distortion issues concerning the microcosm light source may occur and significantly effect the photoautrophic microphytobenthic organisms (Petersen & Hastings, 2001). For example, mean field-approximations of insignificant spatial or temporal variability (e.g. light intensity, temperature, etc.) were assigned to microcosm setups which may offer a degree of control with lower variability (Petersen et. al., 2003). Under shallow depth and transparent boundaries, microcosms were significantly effect as they were exposed to increased light intensity, elevated sediment light, consistent light exposure, increased benthic-water column interactions, reduced surface-bottom mixing, and increased nutrient delivery to the benthic surface (Petersen et. ai., 1997). Chen et. aI., (1997, 2000) also mentions that microcosm may experience a high ratio of periphyton layer area to water volume, creating greater sediment metabolic potential as nutrient uptake is also increased. This may encourage microphytobenthic interactions with denitrification via organic contribution, thus stimulating nitrous oxide production. Since microcosm systems may be less complex, they may not fully represent the full effect of seasonal variability experienced by mesocosms (Petersen et. aI., 2003). Opposed to the controlled continuous nutrient delivery within the microcosm setup, the weekly load nutrient renewal in mesocosms may be influenced by variable environmental conditions as nutrients were possibly consumed by phytoplankton that are favoured in larger radius containers (Chen et.

104

Microcosm wall growth was shown to be minimal. Numerous studies had experienced an increased difficulty in parameter control (i.e. temperature and light regulation) when mesocosm size has increased (Brockmann, 1990; Kemp et. at., 1980; Petersen et. ai., 1999; Whittaker, 1961). It would seem that a controlled environment (microcosm) might lead towards a more conclusive distinction between Si:N load and N20 production than a more turbulent and possible nutrient starved environment that the mesocosm setup may be exposed to.

3.3.2 Hypothesis 2: An increase in P relative to Redfield ratio would result in a relative increase in phytoplanktonic Cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria becomes dominate under nutrient restricted conditions (low N:P) as they are able to utilize atmospheric N and saturated N2 in water via heterocyst structures. However, nitrous oxide yield decreased with decreasing N:P load in the microcosm experiment which was opposed the hypothesis statement. Under low N:P load in microcosms, lugol counts confirmed the abundance of cyanobacteria and decrease of green algae in phytoplankton although numbers may be undervalued as stated earlier. Diatom dominance in phytoplankton may also occur under high N:P and high Si:N, where cyanobacteria become out competed. On the other hand, green algae may proliferate and sink to the benthic region as it becomes dense under high N:P (low Si:N). Similarly to Si load, mesocosm experimentation showed no significant effect of P load among treatment trials.

105

Hypothesis 2a: An increase in Cyanobacteria abundance relative to other photoautotrophs will result in less sinking of organic matter to sediment.
Microbial characterization and numeration of lugol samples via light microscopy have indicated a direct link with cyanobacteria dominance to low N:P load in the microcosm experiment. Although N:P loading showed no significant effect on phosphate within the larger mesocosm setup, N:P loading ratio and location were influential on water column phosphorus loss. There was a greater P-Ioss under low N:P than high N:P treatments within both locations (Figure 3-19) which may suggest a stimulated cyanobacteria activity, and a possible circulation of nutrients within its water column niche. This water column cyanobacteria productivity was further supported in the microcosm setup as there was a greater TOe content in the low N:P trial than in the high N:P treatment.

Hypothesis 2b: A decrease in organic matter deposition will decrease denitrification.
Hamilton mesocosm contained a greater Toe quantity within the water column than Markham mesocosms, which may suggest that Hamilton nitrogen saturation rates were generally greater due to an increased organic potential. Similarly to hypothesis lb, there is a need to analyze sediment organics in order to directly link microbial dominance to nutrient load in order to characterize the events in both the water column and the bethic region.

r I

106

Hypothesis 2c: A decrease in organic matter deposition will decrease N 20 production.

Cycled water column nutrients by cyanobacteria in mesocosm may suggest a lower organic accumulation from the water column to the sediment, hence a generally lower nitrous oxide concentration. However, there were no direct links between benthic organics endorsed by nutrient loads (N:P and Si:N) with nitrous oxide production as mesocosm N20 production was not affected by nutrient loading rates, according to ANOV A results (Table 3-8). Instead, N20 production was a result of denitrification effects that may be seasonally influenced and location dependent.

107

3.3.3 Further Study
A need to emphasize a direct connection between microbial dominance to nutrient load with respect to the Redfield ratio must be further studied. Analysis of water column and specifically sediment samples through additional phytopigmentation and chlorophyll become significant. Specifically, the HPLC quantification of zeaxanthin (cyanobacteria); lutein and chlorophyll b (green algae); and fucoxanthin and chlorophyll c (diatom) would quantify microbial abundance. Manipulation of temporal data based on nutrient load effects of each week instead of data averages may also yield significant conclusions. Considering that the coupling of nitrification to denitrification is sensitive to the sediment oxic layer, depth profiles may be conducted in small scale microcosm sediment in order to determine immediate heterotrophic effects on periphyton thickness, oxygen demand, and denitrification rates. Ecosystem effects involving food webs may also define microbial effects on denitrification, as predator prey and competition models may characterize sediment organic disposition, consequently influencing N20 via denitrification. Variations of the large scale mesocosm approach should also explore aquatic chambers within littoral zones of different eutrophic lakes. This may illustrate environmental effects sensitive to seasonal properties, with an on-going yearly mesocosm setup to historically track seasonal changes. Current biogeochemical analytical techniques and experimental designs are always open for discussion.

Appendix A. MicrocosmlMescosm Analysis Part A: Nutrient Assay Analysis 1. Ammonium 1.1 Reagent Preparation
Reagent preparation involves making a phenol solution (diluting 11.lmlliquefied phenol (89%) with 95% v/v ethyl alcohol to lOOml), 0.5% w/v sodium nitroprusside solution (diluting 0.5g sodium nitroprusside in lOOml water), and oxidizing solution. The oxidizing solution is made by initially dissolving 200g trisodium citrate and 109 sodium hydroxide to lL. A phenoVsodium nitroprusside combination was used instead. By taking 80ml of this mixture to 20ml sodium hypochlorite (commercial bleach), the final oxidizing reagent was formed. Sample standards were made by dissolving 3.l89g anhydrous NH4CI (1.22mglml) in lL water (Greenberg et. al., 1999; Solarzano, 1969). There were 4 standards (Le. 0.25ml, 0.75m!, 1.25ml, 2.50ml stock dissolved with 25ml water) made including a water blank. In cases where samples or standards were too concentrated, the highest standard concentration was diluted before incrementing the standard curve concentrations. For example, all the samples from the mesocosm were too concentrated. A second dilution series was made from the most concentrated standard of the first dilution series.

1.2 Sample Analysis

1
Frozen water samples were thawed and Sml water samples measured in screw capped test tubes. For each sample, OAml phenollsodium nitroprusside solution and then Iml oxidizing solution were immediately added. Samples were allowed an hour up to 24 hours to develop under low light conditions at room temperature (22°C to 27°C). UV-Vis spectrometer analysis at 640nm was carried out on all samples (Greenberg et. ai., 1999).

2. Nitrate 2.1 Cadmium Column Construction
The cadmium column was constructed from a steel cylinder with dimensions length 18.S cm and a 3.Smm diameter. Both cylinder bolt ends were fitted with steel wool to prevent Cu-Cd granule leak and plastic aquarium tube adapters to connect to external setup. Preliminary washing of stock Cu-Cd granule was conducted by rinsing 20g of granules with 6N HCI followed by Millipore water. The secondary wash involved a rinse with SOml 2% CUS04 (Sg CuS04SH20 diluted to 2S0ml water) for at least S minutes or until blue colour partially fades. Successive SOml 2% CUS04 washings were repeated until a brown colloidal precipitate was formed. A gentle water wash was followed afterwards to remove all precipitated Cu. Granule packing was set up by placing the column setup (column end with bolt fitting down and the open cylinder end up) in a plastic tube filled

with buffer (13g N~CI and 1.7g disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate dissolved in lL
with 8.S pH adjustment with concentrated NH40H before dilution) (Methods for chemical analysis of water and wastes. 1979; Greenberg et. al., 1999; Wood et. al., 1967).

130

About 5-10 granules intervals were placed in the column opening and pushed down using a metal rod. Due to the granule varying sizes and rigid form, numerous granules at one time may prematurely clog the column. It is essential that the column be immersed in the buffer at all times ensuring that there is a buffer head space a few millimetres above the opening for an easy granule decent and to allow air bubbles to escape. The column is capped tight with the bolt ending when the granules are level with the column mouth ensuring that the buffer level will also immerse the bolt ending. Column is stored in the same tube with dilute buffer (3OOml buffer mixed with 500ml water) and positioned standing up in the fridge.

In the circumstance of column leaks, sample collection is based on a final 6.5ml total second sample collection as it is the volume of two cuvette volumes (i.e. first volume for rinse, second volume for sample reading). With this column, 13ml total sample was collected where 6.5ml taken as for analysis. Due to the constant transfer of the peristaltic pump tube from sample to sample, minute air bubbles may gather internally. This is rectified by shaking the tube to gather all the air bubbles and reverse flow the column into a beaker of buffer making sure that the column is immersed in buffer within the plastic storage container.

2.2 Sample Preparation/Column Operation
Upon column use, it was hooked to a peristaltic pump with buffer filled tubes. Air bubbles were prevented from entering the initial column/pump hook-up by connecting the pump tubes while the column is still stored in its buffer. The storage tube can be removed when there are no air bubbles coming from column as the pump reverse pumps

131

buffer from the column to an empty vessel. The empty vessel is replaced with a 200ml diluted buffer solution where it is forward pumped into the column. The column becomes activated for experimentation when a l00ml mixture volume of 25% 1.0mg/L nitrate standard and 75% buffer solution ran through the column. Nitrate standards were prepared by drying KN0 3 in an oven at lO5°C for at least 24 hours before use. Nitrate standards were made daily by weighing out 0.18045g dry KN0 3 (lOOuglml) and diluting to 250ml with water. By collecting 25ml from this stock, and then diluting it to 250ml with water would produce a lO.Ouglml. From this stock, 5 standards were produced (i.e. 0.05 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L, 0.2 mg/L' 0.5 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L) including a blank which was Millipore water. Samples were prepared using 25ml screw cap test tubes, 2 test tubes (i.e. sample test tube and collection test tube) for every one sample. The sample test tube consisted of 15ml buffer and 5ml sample. Whereas, the collection test tubes remained empty (Methods for chemical analysis of water and wastes, 1979; Greenberg et. al., 1999; Wood et. ai., 1967). Samples were processed through the Cd column at a rate of 0.043m11s. After column activation, sample collection was performed by discarding the first 10m1 and then collecting the second lOml. The second collection is subjected to a colour reagent at a ratio of 0.260ml for every 6.5ml sample immediately after collection. This colour reagent is made by dissolving 1.0g sulphanilamide with 80ml water and 10m185% phosphoric acid. Once the solid has been dissolved, O.1g N-(l-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride is added where the whole solution is diluted with water to lOOml. considering that this solution is light sensitive, the container was wrapped with aluminium foil and kept in a dark compartment when in use. A pink colour development

will mature after 10 minutes and will over develop if the samples are not analyzed before 2 hours. A UV-Vis spectrometer is used to identify the colour development at 543nm (Methods for chemical analysis of water and wastes, 1979; Greenberg et. al., 1999; Wood

et. al., 1967).

3. Phosphorus 3.1 Reagent Preparation
The volume reagent combination was determined by the number of samples being analyzed. This combination was made as a series of additions in this order: 50ml 5N H2S04, 5ml potassium antimonyl tartrate solution (1.3715g K(SbO)C4 H406 112H zO dissolved in 400ml and diluted to 500ml with water), 15ml ammonium molybdate solution (4g (NR.)6M070z4 4H20 dissolved in lOOml water), and 30ml ascorbic acid solution (1.76g ascorbic acid dissolved in lOOml water, stored in the fridge) (Edwards et.

al., 1965; Greenberg et. aI., 1999; Murphy & Riley, 1962).

3.2 Sample Preparation
Frozen samples were thawed and measured at 5ml into each screw capped test tube. Phosphorus standards were created by dissolving 219.5mg anhydrous KH 2 P04 (50.0 Ilg/ml P04-3) in lL water and taking 1.25ml to dilute to 25ml. a 2.50Ilg/ml stock phosphate solution was created. A standard series of 4 concentrations and a water blank was used. A 0.8ml reagent combination was added to each sample and mixed thoroughly_ This was analyzed under the UV-Vis spectrometer at 880nm ensuring that samples were read between 1000n and 30min.(Edwards et. ai., 1965; Greenberg et. al., 1999; Murphy

133

& Riley, 1962). In cases where samples or standards were too concentrated, the highest

standard concentration was diluted before incrementing the standard curve concentrations. For example, all the samples from the mesocosm were too concentrated. A second dilution series was made from the most concentrated standard of the first dilution series.

4. Silica
Silica standards were made fresh from the dilution of stock solution (4.73g Na2Si03 9H20 dissolved in lL water). There were 4 standards made with a water blank. Frozen samples were prepared by placing 5m1 of each sample in individual screw cap test tubes when they were uniformly thawed. Upon analysis, O.lml diluted HCI (2:1) and O.2ml anunonium molybdate were added rapidly and in succession. After mixing and a 5 to 10 minute resting time, O.2m1 oxalic acid was added and mixed thoroughly. From 2 to 15 minutes, the samples turned shades of yellow and were measured under the UV -Vis spectrometer at 410nm (Eaton et. al., 1995; Greenberg et. al., 1999).

Part B: Gas Analysis

Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) initially ran a 15N2 gas blank (lOOJll
15N2

purged in a vial) at set parameters. The blank along with subsequent samples were

manually injected into the GCIMS via a glass 100111 glass gastight syringe. Injection preparation for each sample injection consisted of drawing ambient air and emptying the syringe. Then the syringe is inserted into the rubber septum of the sample vial where lOOJll is drawn in and emptied into the room. Re-insertion of the syringe into the vial

134

follows with a drawn in 90111 gas which is pumped back into the vial twice (2 pumps). While still in the inserted in the vial, the syringe will draw in 80111 and then down to 50lll. At this time, the syringe should be placed vertically over the injector port once the prerun program on the GCMS is at the 0.1 seconds countdown, in order to prevent gas sample loss. With a swift controlled manner the syringe should be directed into the injector port once the LCD monitor indicates "READY", and injection proceeds immediately by pushing the syringe barrel downwards. With the same swift motion, the whole syringe apparatus should be lifted vertically up to prevent the syringe from bending, and where the "RUN" button is pushed immediately after to active the sample sequence. After the sample run, the chromatogram is selected by selecting "mass" and 30 <Enter> (Holt, 2007).

Part C: Phytopigment Analysis (Denmark)
According to Schluter, et. al. (2000) water samples would be initially stored in liquid nitrogen after being filtered onto GPIF filters. Upon analysis, filters were thawed and placed in 3m} 100% acetone (resultant 90% acetone estimation), sonication on ice for 10 minutes, and extracted at 4 °C for 24 hours. The contents (cells and filter) were filtered using 0.2 llm Teflon syringe filters and disposable syringes. HPLC vials were filled with 1 ml of the resultant sample and O.3ml HPLC grade water. These samples were injected into a Shimadzu LC-lOA HPLC system according to methodology described by Wright

et. al., (1991). This HPLC system would be calibrated using pigment standards provided
from The International Agency for 14C Determination, VK1, Horsholm, Denmark (Schhiier & Havskum, 1997; Schluter et. al., 2000).

Part D: Algal Nutrient Stock Solution (CHU-10) 1. CHU-10 Reagent Preparation
Sterile technique is involved with reagent use. Pipets, reagent bottles, and glassware were autoclaved before use. The following reagents were prepared first before CHU-I0 formula was made.

1.1. Reagent Preparation
1.1.1 Fe-EDTA A lL volume of distilled water was boiled to remove carbon dioxide and dissolve Fesubstrate. This warm water (about 90% volume) initially dissolved S.2g EDTA in aiL volumetric flask. After EDTA had been dissolved, SAg KHC0 3 and S.Og FeS04 ·7HzO were added. Venting periodically once every few minutes must be performed as pressure may build inside. Adding ImllL into the CHU-lO stock will give a final Fe concentration of lmglrnl. May need to shake before use as Fe may precipitate out of solution. Other substitutes may be used and were defined in the original recipe.

1.1.2. Trace Metals Metals should be mixed and completely dissolved individually in order of the list below as precipitation may occur. Reagents are dissolved in a IL volumetric flask. Reagents NazEDTA H3 B03 MnClz·4 H ZO ZnS04·7HzO Na Mo04·SH zO CuS04·SH20 Co(N03h·6HzO LOOg 2.86g 1.8Ig 0.222g 0.390g 0.079g 0.0494g

1.1.3. F12 Vitamin

Requires a small reagent volume to manufacture. The reagents were measured and diluted with a smallest available volumetric flask. For every Iml stock F12 vitamin made, the reagents were measured as follows: Vitamin BJ2 (pharmaceutical vitamin used, may be filtered before use) Biotin Thiamin HCI Img/ml O.lmg/ml 200mgIL

2. CHU-IO Stock Solution
Stock Solution was mixed in following order: Reagents Na2Si03 -9H2O Ca(N03h 4H2O K2 HP04 MgS04 7H 2O Fe-EDTA Na2C03 F/2 Vitamins Trace Metal Mix Cone. 5.8 gIL 57.56 gIL 10 gIL 25 gIL 20 gIL mlIL 10ml Iml Iml Iml 0.8ml Iml Iml Iml

Generally, CHU-I0 was initially acidic. The pH was adjusted according to the microbes involved. NaOH and HCI were used for pH adjustment. Stock diatoms and green algae require 6.4 pH, and cyanobacteria stock used 8.5 pH. For a general community, a neutral pH was ideal. Solutions were stored in the fridge (Stein, 1973).
