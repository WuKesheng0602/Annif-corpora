Activated Fc Receptor Supra molecular Complex
Veronika Petrenko Master of Science Molecular Science 2009 Ryerson University Department of Chemistry & Biology
ABSTRACT

Phagocytosis is a part of immune response. IgG opsonized particles of greater that 1Jlm are recognized by Fey receptors on the surface of professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils. IgGs are part ofimmune system and is a cognate ligand of the Fc receptor. Live Cell Affinity Receptor Chromatography (LARC) was used to capture an activated Fey receptor supramolecular complex from the surface of live human neutrophils, by allowing IgG opsonized microbeads to bind to the cell surface. The cells were burst in PBS, collected and digested along side with controls. Isolated FcyR complex was analysed by LC·MSIMS. Fc and control experiment lists of SEQUEST correlated proteins were screened for a total cumulative score of at least 2400 and a minimum of three different peptides. This served as the basis of protein involvement in the FcyR mediated phagocytosis, which were then searched with iHOP for their interaction partners. Gathered interactions were !hen exported and Cytoscape, Osprey and String algorithms were used to generate network of interacting proteins. PAKs 2-4 and PAK6 were detected with LARC. PAK2 and PAK4 were predicted by algorithms to have a central role in particle uptake. From Western Blotting, endogenous PAKs2-4 and PAK6 were detected in murine macrophages. Immunofluorescent staining was then used to verity presence of these proteins in the forming phagosome and showed localization of PAKs to the phagosome. The same effect was observed with transfection of GFP constructs of PAKs. Upon transfection with dominant negative PAKs reduction in phagocytosis was observed. Thus p21 activated kinase accumulation during phagocytosis was observed and validated that LARC is an accurate and a reliable method of capture of activated supramolecular complex from the cell surface.

INTRODUCTION

Phagocytosis
Receptors expressed on the cell surface recruit proteins to the inner portion of the cell membrane
(Corbett~Nelson.

Mason et al. 2006).

Formation of the active supramolecular

complex requires rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins and recruitment of proteins that are essential for the proper receptor function. Hence, the activated receptor supramolecular complex is comprised of the receptor membrane cytoskeleton and the associated proteins in the activated plasma membrane sub domain (Marshall, Booth et al. 200 I). Phagocytosis is a process internalization of particle such as bacteria, parasites or dying cells of size greater than 1 !lID
(Garcia~Garcia

and Rosales 2002).

Fc receptor mediated

phagocytosis is triggered by binding of IgG opsonized particles to the surface expressed Fcy receptors (Greenberg and Grinstein 2002). Molecular interactions with the Fc receptors not only result in phagocytosis, but also other cellular responses including antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, cytokine production and release of pro inflammatory messengers (Daeron 1997;
Sanchez~Mejorada

and Rosales 1998), all of which playa role in defence against

pathogens. The professional phagocytes are capable of particle engulfment, they are: neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic and mast cells. Although retinal pigmental epithelium cells and Sertoli cells are not termed professional phagocytes they also phagocytose. A large part of the information that is available regarding the signaling events that occur during phagocytosis come from the studies done in murine macrophage cell lines. Signaling differences between

macrophages and neutrophils, as expected, have been observed. It was reported that ERK in

1

FcyR mediated phagocytosis in macrophages is activated but not required for particle uptake (Karimi and Lennartz 1998), while its inhibition in human neutrophils inhibits phagocytosis (Mansfield, Shayrnan et aL 2000). There are several Fc receptor isoforrns. FcyRI, FcyRIla and FcyRIIIb are the main

receptors of human neutrophils (McKenzie and Schreiber 1998). Differential expression ofFcyR isoforrns such as presence of FcyRIIIB exclusively in neutrophils which lacks a transmembrane portion and the cytoplasmic tail and is linked to the membrane through glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI); (Figure J); (Ravetch and Bolland 2001) and may result in signalling variation among phagocytic cells. Murine macrophages have FcyRI, FcyRIla, FcyRIlb and FcyRIV, of which

FcyRIlb has been shown to have a negative effect on phagocytosis (Figure J) (Garcia-Garcia and Rosales 2002).

Phosphorylation of the intracellular portion of the Fc receptors or ITAMs by Src family kinase upon binding of IgG opsonized particles initiates cascade of signaling events leading to particle uptake. FcyRIIB contains an ITIM phosphorylation of which is inhibitory to phagocytosis. Binding to Fcy receptor (FcyR) by Fc portion of IgG initiates intracellular signaling through phosphorylation of FcyRs' immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motifs (ITAMs)

(Isakov 1997) by Src family tyrosine kinases (Figure 2); (Fitzer-Attas, Lowry et a1. 2000). Phosphorylation of ITIMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibiting motifs) on FcyRJIB, on the other hand, leads to inhibition of phagocytosis.

Figure 2. Early signaling events during Fe mediated phagocytosis. Src kinase phosphorylates ITAMs leading to recruitment of more Src to the site of phagocytosis. Activated ITAMs then recruit Syk kinase leading to activation ofPI3K.
Phosphorylated ITAMs then recruit more Src family kinases (Kiefer, Brumell et a1. 1998), and serve as docking sites for the SH2 domains of Syk (Turner, Schweighoffer et a1. 2000). This leads to activation of downstream signaling events resulting in actin polymerization, formation of phagocytic cup and particle internalization. Many signaling proteins are activated and recruited to the site of phagocytosis, including PI3K, PLCs, PLD, PKC, ERK, JNK, small Rho GTPases family proteins, numerous guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), as well as proteins required for actin rearrangement to occur including WASP, Arp2l3 complex, cofilin and myosins (Greenberg and Grinstein 2002).

PI3K is involved in many different signaling events including cell growth and movement. Syk phosphorylation leads to activation of PI3K (Garcia-Garcia and Rosales 2002). PI3K is

required for phagocytosis and its activation has been shown to be required for pseudopod extension (Cox, Tseng et a!. 1999) and phagosome closure (Araki, 10hnson et a1. 1996)s. PI3K inhibition leads to arrest in phagocytosis (Cox, Tseng et a1. 1999). Type II PI3Ks convert

PIC4,5)P into PI(3,4,5)P by phosphorylation of the 3' group on PIP2, which can activate a number of GEFs. Depletion of PI(4,5)P is accompanied by an increase of PI(3,4,5)P in the nascent

phagosome membrane, with the concentration of PI(3,4,5)P remaining high until phagosome closure. Lipid mobility was shown to be reduced in the membrane around the particle while lipids on the unstimulated membrane remained freely mobile (Marshall, Booth et a1. 2001; Corbett-Nelson, Mason et a1. 2006). 1>IP3 accumulation at the plasma membrane allows regulation of filopodia extension through regulation of Cdc42. Rac! is also positively regulated by PI(3,4,5)P (Araki, Johnson et a1. 1996; Srinivasan, Wang et a1. 2003). ERK activation during FcyR mediated particle uptake was demonstrated to be dependent on PI3K (Coxon, Rane et a1. 2000). Type I PI3K phosphorylates PIP converting it into PIP2 which serves as a substrate for PLC. Type III PI3K converts PI to PIP and this is important for later stages of phagocytosis and may contribute to activation ofNADPH oxidase. Phosphoinositide specific PLC isoforms catalyze hydrolysis phospholipids, in this process phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate is converted into DAG and IP3 (inositol-! ,4,5-

triphosphate) leading to activation of PKC and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, respectively (Figure 3); (Wilde and Watson 2001). Ca2+ increase is associated with phagocytosis with the highest concentration found in the cytoplasm around the phagocytic cup (Sawyer,

4

Sullivan et a1. 1985). However, at low Ca2+ concentration phagocytosis is not disrupted (Di Virgilio, Meyer et a1. 1988). Phagocytic cup closure was also shown to be dependent on

activation ofPKC (Larsen, DiGennaro et al. 2000).

Figure 3. Phospholipids involved in phagocytosis.
PLD catalyses hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) into phosphotidic acid (PA) which can activate PLCy and PLA2 (Lennartz 1999). PI(3,4)P is required for PLD activity. Expression of PLD mutants correlates with a decrease in phagocytosis (Delame,. Taylor et al. 2001). It was also demonstrated that both PLD I and PLD2 are essential in phagocytosis of IgG opsonized particles in murine macrophages (Corrotte, Chasserot-Golaz et al. 2006). PLDI is found on

endosomes during the formation and maturation of phagosomes while PLD2 is associated with the plasma membrane and is activated upon stimulation ofFcyRs leading to production ofPA, in

turn stimulating PIP2 production which leads to activation of PLD 1 on the late endosomes
(Corrotte, Chasserot-Golaz et al. 2006) that are then involved in fusion to the phagosome. PLD

5

can also activate PKC via conversion of PLD-generated PA into DAO by phosphatidic acid phosphatase 1 (Lennartz 1999). Small Rho GTPases play a prominent role in phagocytosis. Members of the family

include proteins such as Rac, Cdc42 and RhoA. Involvement of Cdc42 in phagocytosis is well established. It is mainly involved in modulation of actin dynamics leading to formation of the phagocytic cup. Cdc42 is recruited early in the process around the tips of extending pseudopods (Hoppe and Swanson 2004). It must be inactivated to allow depolymerization ofF-actin around the phagosome (Hoppe and Swanson 2004). Cdc42 is critically involved in initiating the early events in phagocytosis through its ability to activate p21 activated kinases and WASP that triggers the localized polymerization of actin (Robinson and Badwey 2002). Cdc42 was shown to co localize with WASP and actin in the core of the podosome (Linder, Nelson et al. 1999). Actin polymerization is driven by Arp2/3 complex activation through the WAVE complex downstream of Rac (Figure 4); (Bosse, Ehinger et a1. 2007). Rac is classified as a member of the Rho GTPases (Bokoch 2005). Rac has been shown to be present during phagocytosis and is involved in variety of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal reorganization, regulation of cell growth and activation of protein kinases (Bokoch 2005). Rac1 and Rac2 are closely related, low molecular weight OTP-binding proteins that have different roles during phagocytosis. Rac 1 is involved in the formation of the phagocytic cup while Rac2 was linked to NADPH oxidase activation (Gu, Jia et a1. 2001). Both isoforms have been implicated in regulation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase with Rac2 being the predominant in that function in human neutrophils (Heyworth, Knaus et a1. 1993; Bokoch 2005). The amount of

6

Rae! and Rac2 that is expressed may play a role in the ability to regulate the Nox complex. Human neutrophils have been shown to express between 1140 (Heyworth, Bohl et al. 1994) and

y.. (Li, Yamauchi et al. 2002) of Rae! compared to Rac2, but show equal proportions in murine
neutrophils (Li, Yamauchi et al. 2002). Rac1l2 are also differentially expressed during

phagocytosis: activation of Racl occurs in phagocytic cups and during closure while Rac2 is active during phagosome closure with activity at the lower portion of the phagocytic cup (Hoppe and Swanson 2004).

Figure 4. Role a/small Rho GTPases during phagocytosis. Cdc42 and Racl both playa role in
actin dynamics. Rac1lCdc42 lead to elongation of actin filaments by stimulation of Arp2/3 complex via WAVE and WASP activation. Another mode of action ofRac and Cdc42 is through p21 activated kinases and LIM kinases activation of which arrests function of cofilin, required for severing of actin. Together Rac and Cdc42 act on Arp2/3 complex and cofilin regulating actin polymerization.

DOCK180 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and ELMO (an adaptor protein) function together for optimal Rac activation (Lu and Ravichandran 2006). Also signaling from focal adhesions leads to the local inactivation of Rac1 by inhibiting paxillin (a multi-domain focal adhesion adaptor molecule) via dephosphorylation and blocking of the DOCK180/ELMO signaling (Lu and Ravichandran 2006). Rho was found to be essential for actin accumulation around the pseudopod extensions and for FcyR-mediated Ca2+ signaling (Hackam, Rotstein et al. 1997). RhoA activity is

increased in the presence of active PTP-PEST (protein tyrosine phosphatase 12) (Sastry, Rajfur et al. 2006) which is involved in membrane ruming and motility and is associated with a decrease in Racl (Sastry, Lyons et al. 2002). RhoA activates ROCK, leading to myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which is dependent on RhoA and ROCK activities (Vicente-Manzanares, Cabrero et at. 2002). It was demonstrated that MAP3Kl binds to pI15 RhoGAP and that RhoA can regulate MAP3Kl by binding to its amino terminus (Gallagher, Gutowski et al. 2004). Cytoskeletal rearrangement is crucial to progression of particle uptake. Actin dynamics are central during phagocytosis with actin localization at the sites of particle attachment and in pseudopod extension during particle engulfment. During actin polymerization, actin monomers are added to the actin's free barbed ends, the number of which has to be increased for efficient polymerization to occur. There are three mechanisms by which free barbed ends can be

generated. The first one involves uncapping existing barbed ends by gelsolin related proteins or by a capping protein (Hartwig, Bokoch et al. 1995). The second mechanism involves de novo actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex (Pollard, Blanchoin et al. 2000). The third way

8
I

in which barbed ends can be freed is through severing of actin by cofilin (Chan, Bailly et a1. 2000). Cofilin is a final GTPase effector that binds actin. It promotes actin depolymerization by dissociation of actin monomers from the pointed end of actin filaments (Bamburg 1999). Formation of free barbed ends can also be done by cofilin through severing of actin filaments (Chan, Bailly et a1. 2000). Availability of free barbed ends can increase actin nucleation of the

Arp2/3 complex (DesMarais, Ghosh et aI. 2005).
WASP and WAVE family proteins are scaffolds that link upstream signals to the activation of the ARP2/3 complex, leading to actin polymerizat~on. The VCA region of WASP acts as a platform for actin polymerization: CA domains bind to the Arp2/3 complex while V domain binds actin monomers bringing them to the Arp2/3 complex (Takenawa and Suetsugu 2007). The WHI domain of WASP can bind to and form heterodimers with the WIP family of proteins which help to maintain stability of WASP complex (Ramesh, Anton et a1. 1997; Krzewski, Chen et a1. 2006). WIP was shown to act as a scaffold that links Nck and CrkL with WASP at the sites of active actin nucleation (Frischknecht, Moreau et al. 1999; Moreau, Frischknecht et at. 2000; Sasahara, Rachid et a1. 2002). WASP was shown to bind to Cdc42 (Symons, Derry et a1. 1996). Profilin contributes to Cdc42-induced nucleation of actin filaments in high speed supernatant of lysed neutrophils. complex (Yang, Huang et a1. 2000).
It enhances nucleation by activating Arp2/3

Proline rich domains of WASP and NWASP can bind

proteins with SH3 domain and profilin which has a role in supplying actin monomers to WASP (Yang, Huang et a1. 2000). WAVE is also capable of binding profilin (Miki, Suetsugu et al.

1998). WAVE promotes Arp2l3 dependent actin polymerization downstream of Rho-GTPase

Initial mechanism of regulation of WAVE induced actin nucleation sites that Rac and Nck cause disassociation of the WAVE complex, releasing active WAVE and leading to actm polymerization (Eden, Rohatgi et a1. 2002). without binding to it. The Src family of tyrosine kinases phosphorylate WASP which is enhanced by Cdc42 binding (Torres and Rosen 2003) together contributing to activation of the Arp2/3 complex (Takenawa and Suetsugu 2007). Cortactin is an Src substrate that drives actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex and also stabilizes the cortical actin network (Perrin, Amann et al. 2006). Cortactin binds the Arp2/3 and to the actin filaments, which helps activate the Arp2/3 complex and stabilize the newly created branches between the filaments (Weaver, Young et a1. 2003). Expressed mutants of cortactin that decreased binding of Arp2/3 complex or dynamin 2 also decreased actin dynamics (Schafer, Weed et a1. 2002). Arp2/3 mediated actin polymerization regulates the accessibility of cortactin to dynamin 2 and drive the fission of clathrin-coated pits in an actin polymerization dependent manner (Zhu, Zhou et a1. 2005). Dynamin 2 is a GTPase recruited early during phagocytosis in macrophages. Since PI3K inhibitors blocked dynamin 2 from being recruited to the site of phagocytosis (Gold, Underhill et a1. 1999) it should function downstream of PI3K.
It is recruited to the forming phagosome

WAVE2 relays Rac signaling

through interaction with amphiphysin 11m which is also required for phagocytosis (Gold, Morrissette et a1. 2000). Interaction of Dynamin 2 with cortactin was shown to be involved in organization of actin filaments at membranes (Schafer, Weed et a!. 2002). Actin rearrangement may also be regulated by dynamin 2 via its interaction with profilin. Dynamin was shown to

10

modulate localization and function of Rac (Schlunck, Damke et al. 2004) through which it may regulate cytoskeletal events during phagocytosis. It is also associated with endocytic vesicles (Gold, Underhill et al. 1999) which fuse with growing phagosomes. Myosins are motor proteins that provide the propulsive force for movement from their interaction with actin. ATP hydrolysis by myosins provides energy which is converted into A number of different myosins were shown to be

involved in phagocytosis; among them are myosin I (Allen and Aderem 1995), myosin II (Olazabal, Caron et al. 2002) myosin Va (AI-Haddad, Shonn et al. 2001), myosin VII (Titus 1999), myosin X (Cox, Berg et al. 2002). Myosins IC, V and IXb were found around Myosin X was shown to be

involved in PI3K dependent signaling (Cox, Berg et al. 2002). The ERK signaling cascade was shown to activate MLCK which then activates myosins (Mansfield, Shayman et al. 2000). Activation of ROCK by Rho inactivates myosin phosphatase which allows phosphorylation of myosin light chain by MLCK (Figure 5); (Vicente-Manzanares, Cabrero et aI. 2002). The presence of many different myosins around the forming phagosome is an indicator of myosin involvement in the internalization of the forming phagosomes with them either acting as motor and/or structural proteins. Myosins may also play a role in movement of vesicles to the

phagocytic cup during focal exocytosis. Oxidative burst is another process that has been associated with phagocytosis. The first NADPH oxidase (NOX) to be identified was in phagocytic cells and it remains one of the best studied ones (Bokoch and Knaus 2003). NADPH oxidase is a membrane associated enzyme complex composed of cytosolic and membrane associated components (Babior 1999; Bokoch

11

and Diebold 2002), activation of which leads to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS);
(Figure 6); (Babior 1999).

Cytosolic subunit p47phox is phosphorylated upon leukocyte

activation leading to translocation of p47phoxlp67phox to the internal membrane where they interact with flavocytochrome b558 (cyt b), forming an active oxidase (Babior 1999). The

combined action of ERK, Akt, and PKC results in translocation of p47phox resulting in the assembly of NOX in human neutrophils (Chen, Powell et a1. 2003). NADPH oxidase is also regulated by Rho GTPases with Rac2 predominantly functioning in human neutrophils (Heyworth, Knaus et al. 1993). The GTP bound form of Rac2 activates Nox by binding to p67phox subunit (Diekmann, Abo et a1. 1994).

NOX complex and nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) may function together to increase the destruction of pathogens via the formation of reactive species. NOS2A generated NO has been shown to be involved in innate immunity (Diefenbach, Schindler et a1. 1999) by being a precursor for cytokine signaling. Racl and Rac2 were shown to be interacting partners ofNOS2 in activated murine macrophages. Rac2 however may be involved in stimulation of NOS2

activity and may affect its cellular redistribution (Kuncewicz, Balakrishnan et al. 2001). Src is capable ofNOS2A tyrosine phosphorylation (Hausel, Latado et a1. 2006).

Figure 6. Respiratory burst in phagocytosis. Oxidative burst is one of the processes associated
with phagocytosis. NOX complex is activated through combined action of PKC, ERK and Akt. The binding of Rac2 to p67phox subunit of NO X leads to activation of the complex. The active NADPH complex forms reactive oxygen species inhibitory to pathogens being taken. Nitric oxide synthase leads to production of NO, which upon reaction with oxygen can form N02 or ONOO. Membrane replenishment during phagocytosis allows macrophages to engulf a large amount of particles from their surface, unlike the enucleated human neutrophils which lack intracellular granules and thus cannot ingest as many particles (Roos, Voetman et a1. 1983). Focal exocytosis has been shown to playa role in supplying the ever growing need for membrane

13

at the site of particle intake. Lack of SNAREs, proteins involved in membrane fusion events, has been shown to reduce phagocytosis (Booth, Trimble et at. 2001). Rab GTPases are associated with vesicle trafficking and are implicated in focal exocytosis. reduced phagocytosis (Cox, Lee et a1. 2000). Rab 11 deficient cells have

Rab7 which regulates traffic to and from

endosomes, is important for phagosome maturation in macrophages (Harrison, Bucci et a1. 2003). Dynamin 2 was also implicated in movement of vesicles to the forming phagosome (Di, Nelson et a1. 2003).

Figure 7. Summary ofsignaling during FcyR mediated phagocytosis in neutrophils. Binding of IgG coated microbeads to Fc receptors leads to their phosphorylation through recruitment of Syk and Src family kinases leading to activation of PI3K which is followed by activation of Cdc42 by guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for it. GTP bound Cdc42 then stimulates activation of the Arp2/3 complex leading to actin nucleation and polymerization. Cdc42 activation also leads to downstream phosphorylation of cofilin which inhibits severing of actin filaments. Racl has similar effect on cofilin and Arp2/3 complex however it is activated later on during phagocytosis (Hoppe and Swanson 2004). Internalization of the phagosome can be done through motor action of myosins which can be activated through Rho-ROCK-MLCK action or via PKC mediated phosphorylation of MLCK. NADPH oxidase activity is dependent on regulation of its subunits by Rac2 (Bokoch 2005), PKC, ERK and Akt action (Chen, Powell et al. 2003) that leads to generation of reactive oxygen species. NO is also produced during phagocytosis which is a result of signaling through activation of p38 and ERK which leads to iNOS gene transcription and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Live-cell Affinity Receptor Chromatography In depth characterization of FcyR mediated phagocytosis and capture of the fully functional supramolecular receptor complex signaling events was made possible through manual screening of proteins in an MSMS database developed previo~sly using the method of Live-cell Affinity Receptor Chromatography (LARC) (Jankowski, Zhu et a1. 2008). LARC is based on the in situ isolation of fully functional supramolecular FcyR complex. LARC is an extension of previously established methods that are based on the binding of ligand microbeads to the cell surface of nascent phagosomes (Marshall, Booth et a1. 2001). Some phagocytic proteins are

thought to remain on the internalized micro bead after phagosome closure (Garin, Diez et a1. 2001). Assembly of the receptor complex and its capture from the cell surface is accomplished by micro beads coated with Fc receptor cognate ligand (IgG) followed by careful comparison to control beads is needed to identify proteins that are specifically bound to the Fc receptor. There are a number of algorithms available that can be used to construct protein interaction networks. Specifically In/ormation Hyperlinked Over Proteins (iHOP) (Hoffmann

and Valencia 2004) allows navigation ofPubMed abstracts and provides easy access to published data as relevant to the gene or protein product queried. Relevant protein relationships can be stored and used in developments of interaction models which can be exported (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005) and visualized through network building software such as Cytoscape (Shannon, Markiel et a1. 2003), String (Jensen, Kuhn et a1. 2009) or Osprey (Breitkreutz, Stark et a1. 2003) which allows visualization, modification and manipulation of complex gene networks. Since my research we focused on p21 activated kinases, these proteins are reviewed in some detail in the following pages.

pl1 activated kinases (PAKs)

PAKs are serine/threonine protein kinases with 6 isoforms identified in both human and mouse. They are divided into two groups: PAKs 1,2,3 belong to group I and are distinct from the second group (PAKs 4,5,6) in that they are activated by Rho GTPases, specifically Cdc42 and/or Racl (Eswaran, Soundararajan et al. 2008). Separation of the two groups is not only based on their regulation but also on the protein structure (Figure 8). A highly conserved Cterminal catalytic kinase domain is common to both group I and II PAKs, the regulatory Nterminal domain is the source of structural variation. Group I PAKs contain GTPase (P21)

binding domain (PBD) and an auto-inhibitory domain (AID) that overlaps PBD. AID is absent in group II PAKs. AID acts as a pseudo substrate forcing the kinase domain to adopt an

autoinhibited inactive conformation. Upon Rho GTPase interaction with PBD, the activating loop is phosphorylated which is otherwise prevented. The functions of different PAK isoforms were studied through generation of genetic knockout mice. PAK!, 3 and 5 gene knockout mice were viable, while deletions ofPAK2 and 4 genes resulted in embryonic lethality (Eswaran, Soundararajan et al. 2008). PAK4 deletion

mainly lead to lethality from defects in the fetal heart. Also, neuronal development and axonal outgrowth abnormalities were reported (Qu, Li et aL 2003). Mice that were double knockouts with PAK5 and PAK6 genes had behavioural and locomotory defects, but they were fertile and viable (Nekrasova, Jobes et aL 2008). Different expression patterns are also observed from isoform to isoform, with Ubiquitous expression of PAK2 while PAKl, 3 and 5 are detected in the brain, but not exclusively. PAK4

18

and PAK6 have high expression in testis and prostate, with PAK4 also being found in the colon (Eswaran, Soundararajan et al. 2008).

Figure 8. Group / and Group II PAKs structure comparison. Despite a high degree of variation in the PBD, especially in the Group II PAKs, the kinase domains are highly conserved. Group II PBDs share only 40% similarity to those of Group I PAKs. The degree of similarity is shown in per cent below the domains relative to PAKI for Group I and PAK4 for Group II. Group I PAKs have an auto inhibitory domain which is lacking in Group II. PAK2
PAK2 can be activated by small G proteins, Rac1, Cdc42 or through caspase cleavage (Rudel and Bokoch 1997). Caspase cleavage leaves a 34kDa activated Pak2 lacking most of the N-terminal regulatory 'domain including the AID domain. Caspase 3 cleaves PAK2 adjacent to Asp-212 and this residue is inaccessible in PAKl and is absent in PAK3 thus this mode of

19

activation of PAKs is only possible with PAK2.

Protease-dependent activation of PAK2

independent of RhoGTPases. This cleaved Pak2 has a function that differs from full length Pak2 which normally stimulates cell survival and cell growth, while the truncated analogue was shown to function in programmed cell death (Jakobi, McCarthy et al. 2003; Koeppel, McCarthy et al. 2004). Transfection of truncated PAK2 promoted apoptosis (Lee, MacDonald et al. 1997). In comparison, kinase dead mutant transfected cells had delayed apoptosis and decreased formation of apoptotic bodies (Rudel and Bokoch 1997). Phosphorylation plays a role in PAK2 activation by Cdc42 and Racl. Dephosphorylation is also an important means of PAK2 regulation. Protein phosphatase lA was shown to act on phospho-Thr-402, required for PAK2 activity, leading to down regulation of its kinase activity (Wang and Wang 2008). Cdc42 activation of PAK2 via phosphorylation of serine 14 induced c-Abl activity (Roig, Huang et al. 2000). c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase involved in a variety of cellular responses. PAK2 and c-Abl were also shown to co localize in the cytoplasm of dorsal ruffles and it can also phosphorylate c-Abl interacting proteins (Machuy, Campa et al. 2007). Abl mediated PAK2

tyrosine phosphorylation leads to down regulation of PAK2 activity (Roig, Tuazon et at. 2000) while phosphorylation of Ser 637 and 638 by PAK2 diminishes the ability of c-Abl to interact with its binding partner Abi2. However interaction with Crk is stimulated, where Crk is phosphorylated by c-Abl (Jung, Pendergast et al. 2008). PAK2 was reported to form a complex with Fyn and Nck (Lamalice, Houle et al. 2006). Furthermore, cotransfection of Pak2 and Syk leads to the activation of JNK (Miah, Sada et al. 2004). Pak2 coexpressed with an inactive form of Cdc42 or kinase-inactive Pak2 interacts to a

20

lesser extent with Syk, suggesting that Pak2-Syk association is enhanced by Pak2 activation (Miah, Sada et a1. 2004). PAK2 was shown to playa role in clathrin-independent endocytosis of IL2R, with cortactin playing a role downstream ofPAK2 (Grassart, Dujeancourt et a1. 2008). Enhanced activation of PAK2 by Rac! and Cdc42 was observed when PAK2 was coexpressed with Src family tyrosine kinases, which led to phosphorylation of Tyr 13 0 in a small fraction of cellular PAK2 (Renkema, Pulkkinen et a1. 2002). This phosphorylation may be

dependent on the conformational change observed in PAK2 as a result of binding to GTPases (Renkema, Pulkkinen et a1. 2002). One of the major effectors ofPAKs are LIM kinases. They are involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics through inactivation of ADF/cofilin. PAK2 and PAK4 were

shown to regulate LIMKI and 2. MRCK and Rho kinase can phosphorylate and thus activate LIMK (Bokoch 2003), providing a parallel signaling mechanism. Cellular contractions can be in part mediated by PAK2. MCLK phosphorylation by

PAK2 on Ser439 and Ser991 inactivates it and thus prevents it from phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain (Goeckeler, Masaracchia et a1. 2000). However, binding of

calmodulin, an MLCK activator, prevents Ser991 phosphorylation by PAK2 (Goeckeler, Masaracchia et a1. 2000), which could be a more important site for inhibition of catalytic activity by PAKs. PAK2 is capable ofR-MLC (regulatory myosin light chain) phosphorylation resulting in increased contractility (Zeng, Lagunoff et a1. 2000). Regulation of contractile activity by

PAKs is likely a complex interplay between other molecular messengers such as Ca2+/ Calmodulin. Another myosin which maybe regulated by PAK2 is myosin VI, which is an

21

unconventional myosin in that it translocates towards pointed ends on actin filaments while others move towards barbed ends (Bokoch 2003).
PAK3

This member of the PAK family was shown to be involved in genetic disorders,
specifi~ally

mutations in the PAK3 gene lead to X-linked non-symptomatic mental retardation

syndrome (MRX); where mental retardation is accompanied by normal brain development and few symptoms. PAK3 mutations in MRX affected subjects led to absent or abnormal axonal connections, implicating PAK3 in formation of axonal connections in the human brain (Hofmann, Shepelev et al. 2004). PAK3 may also be needed for dendritic development and has been implicated in the spine morphogenesis (Kreis, Thevenot et al. 2007) where cytoskeletal rearrangement plays an important role. Actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines is under the control of RhoGTPases, of which Cdc42 was shown to stimulate the function of PAK3 (Kreis, Thevenot et al. 2007). Dissociation of active RhoGTPases from PAK3 has been reported, after initial activation has occurred (Manser, Leung et al. 1994). Dendritic spines undergo actin based motility (Fischer, Kaech et al. 1998). It was shown that PAK3 kinase activity induces formation of long, thin dendritic outgrowths, and it was implicated in GITIIPIXIRaclPAK complex in regulation of dendritic spine formation through downstream regulation of MLC by PAK proteins (Zhang, Webb et al. 2005). ARHGEF6 was implicated in PAK3 activation in dendritic cells during spme

morphogenesis (Node-Langlois, Muller et al. 2006), however it was also shown to be an activator of Cdc42 and Racl (Baird, Feng et al. 2005). PAK3 was shown to phosphorylate myosin ID

22

(Wu, Lee et al. 1996) and myosin VI on Thr406 which significantly enhanced its actin translocating activity (Yoshimura, Homma et al. 2001). MEKK1, a protein that serves a role in stress response signaling, is indirectly activated by PAK3 (Siow, Kalmar et al. 1997). transfected with constitutively active PAK3 or Cdc42 JNKI (Bagrodia, Derijard et al. 1995). There are four PAK3 splice isoforms that have been identified, all of which are expressed in brain, specifically in neurons (Kreis, Rousseau et al. 2008). Alternatively spliced exons band c are inserted in the regulatory PBD/AID domains of PAK3, resulting in molecular weight differences in expressed proteins: PAK3a, PAK3b, PAK3c and PAK3cb had weights of 65, 68, 69, and 72kDa, respectively (Kreis, Rousseau et al. 2008). The presence of those inserts also

Cells

PAK3 were shown to activate

alters kinase activity; PAK3b, PAK3c and PAK3cb showed high kinase activity independent of presence of Cdc42, in contrast to that of PAK3a. Also it was shown that presence of insert b reduces binding of Cdc42. The novel PAK3 isoforms also showed altered formation and

localization of focal adhesions resulting in major changes in cell morphology (Kreis, Rousseau et al. 2008). Because of the location of those insets, they could bring new regulatory modifications to PAK3 leading to functional diversification during signal transduction, such as redirection of alternatively spliced PAK3s to other GTPase activation. Knock down of PAK3 function in

hippocampal splice cultures leads to thin, elongated and immature type spines while constitutively active PAK3 showed no effect (Boda, Jourdain et al. 2008). alphaPIX was shown to function with PAK3 in spine morphogenesis. Defects result in mental retardation. Constitutively active PAK3 potentially rescues the phenotype resulting from aphaPIX gene destruction (Node-Langlois, Muller et al. 2006). PAK3 is responsive to

23

thormbonin and other G protein coupled receptors, although JNK activation occurs in their response it is independent ofPAK.3 (Malcolm, Chambard et a1. 2000).
PAK4

PAK4 plays one of the major roles in cytoskeletal reorganization (Eswaran, Soundararajan et a1. 2008). It is a known effector of Rac 1 (Zhang, Chernoff et a1. 1998) and was shown to be central for podosome formation in human macrophages (Gringel, Walz et a1. 2006). PAK4 is involved in a protein complex composed of SSH-IL, LIMK, and 14-3-3zeta through which it regulates the actin depolymerization process by regulation of ADF/cofilin. Phosphorylation of SSH-IL by PAK4 exerts a negative effect on it (Soosairajah, Maiti et al. 2005). Pak4 regulates LIMKI and SSH-IL via phosphorylation which serves as a mechanism of regulation of actin dynamics (Soosairajah, Maiti et a1. 2005). Down regulation of PAK4, an

inhibitor of neutrite outgrowth, was observed in neuroblastoma cell lines (Nowicki, Kosacka et a1. 2007). PAK4 was shown to be up regulated in prostate cancer (Ahmed, Shea et a1. 2008) and recently implicated in cell motility of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Kimmelman, Hezel et a1. 2008). It was reported that variation in expression levels of PAK4 is proportional to LIMKI mediated phosphorylation of cofilin. This also correlated to changes in cell morphology and a change in cell migration behaviour downstream of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Ahmed, Shea et al. 2008), which is known to increase cancer invasiveness. HGF was previously shown to stimulate PAK4 activity in a PI3K dependent manner which contributed to HGF-induced changes in actin organization (Wells, Abo et a1. 2002). Over expression or activation of PAK4

24

was found to be key step in oncogenic transfonnation due to its ability to promote cell survival, resulting uncontrolled proliferation (Liu, Xiao et al. 2008). PAK4 was also shown to be required for full stimulation of pro-survival pathway in response to TNF alpha stimulation (Li and Minden 2005).. NFkappaB and ERK pathway activation was reduced in the absence of PAK4 (Li and Minden 2005). Inhibition of apoptotic signals by PAK4 is also consistent with its phosphorylation of a proapoptotic protein BAD on Ser112 and inhibition of caspase activation (Gnesutta, Qu et al. 2001). Inactivation of BAD

promotes cell survival through inactivation of a mitochondrial pathway and cytochrome c release (Downward 1999). Expression of constitutively active or wild type PAK4 showed reduction in apoptosis in response to TNFalpha stimulation and UV radiation (Gnesutta, Qu et al. 2001). Interestingly, and consistent with anti apoptotic properties of PAK4, it is capable of inactivation of caspase 8 in a manner that is not dependent on its kinase activity (Gnesutta and Minden 2003). PAK4 activates GEF HI by phosphorylation leading to activation of Rae and inhibition of Rho pathway (Callow, Zozulya et al. 2005). This interaction also stimulates lamelopodia

fonnation and is associated with mierotubules thus blocking stress fiber fonnation (Callow, Zozulya et at. 2005). As a result ofPAK4 being targeted by Akt (a survival protein), GEFHl is also phosphorylated during .Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium infections, this in turn controls cell survival through regulation of actin dynamics as a result of GEFHl regulation of RhoA, Rac 1 and actin (Kuijl, Savage et at. 2007). PAK4 can antagonize Rho activity through direct interaction with RhoGEF (Barac, Basile et al. 2004). Direct interaction of PAK4 with PDZ-RhoGEF negatively regulates activation of

25

Rho (Barac, Basile et at 2004). PAK4 also interacts specifically with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and weakly activates the JNK signaling. Downstream activation of NFkappaB and ERK pathways is reduced in the absence ofPAK4 (Li and Minden 2005).
PAK6

Limited data is available for PAK6 which belongs to the second group of p21 activated kinases. It was originally identified from its interaction with androgen receptor and was shown to have cytoplasmic localization (Lee, Ramos et al. 2002). Similarly to other members of group II PAKs, PAK6 lacks the AID domain, resulting in alternative regulation of this protein as compared to those belonging to group I PAKs. Activated Cdc42 has stronger PAK6 binding than GTP-Rac. This binding was observed as a result of interaction with androgen receptors (AR) but does not stimulate kinase function. PAK6 was demonstrated to inhibit AR (Lee, Ramos et al. 2002) for which kinase activity was necessary (Schrantz, da Silva Correia et al. 2004). Protein phosphatase IB and IQGAPI were shown to be PAK6 interacting partners using affinity purification and LC-MSIMS (Kaur, Yuan et al. 2008). PPIB is a member ofPP2C family of Serffhr protein phosphatases involved in negative regulation of the cellular stress response pathways including p38 and JNK (Takekawa, Maeda et al. 1998), as well as down-regulation of NFkappaB (Prajapati, Verma et al. 2004). PAK6 is activated via phosphorylation by p38 and its upstream regulator MKK6 at Ser-165 and Tyr*566. During this, an auto phosphorylation site Ser-560 remains unaltered thus PAK6 is regulated by both auto phosphorylation and MKK6 (Kaur, Liu et al. 2005).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Live-cell affinity receptor chromatography (LARC)

RAW264. 7 cells were obtained from ATTC and grown in DMEM+5% FBS. To minimize the presence of proteins from the growth media prior to the experiment, cells were washed four times in ice cold, isotonic medium containing 20 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCI and 1 mM each of CaCb and MgCb. The Fc receptor ligand, IgG, was bound onto polystyrene beads in PBS

(Marshall, Booth et al. 2001). The beads were washed followed by binding to the surface of live cells on ice in an experimental medium before washing away unbound beads. 2Jlm polystyrene beads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN) coated with human IgG were added to live RAW 264.7 cells in experimental medium on ice for 30 min. Free beads were washed off 3 times in ice cold medium. Incubation on ice prevents IgG receptor complex internalization. The cells were

warmed for 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and in some cases 10 min at 37°C to activate receptors to their full potential. The experiment was quenched with ice cold experimental buffer; the cells were scrapped, to collect the beads before the receptor complexes could be internalized. At this point the bulk of the beads could be washed from the cells by vigourous mechanical action (Figure 9). A French Press was used to disrupt the cells followed by isolation of ligand coated microbeads with a sucrose gradient in a 1 ml sample volume (Beckman, USA); (Burkhardt 1998). The same beads with ligands were used for traditional immuno affinity chromatography (lAC) of the receptor complex from crude lysates. For the negative control the same beads

without the ligands were incubated with crude extracts or growth media. The beads without ligands incubated in crude extracts or only used experimental buffer were isolated through sucrose gradient centrifugation. Proteins from isolated beads were gradually extracted with salts

27

(Foster, de Hoog et al. 2006) from 0 to 1000mM NaCI in steps of 50 or 100mM. The LARC experiment was perfOImed multiple times and each time compared to affinity ligand capture of the receptor complex or to beads alone incubated with crude extract or growth media.
LC-MS~IS

The Bradford method was used to measure protein content (Bradford 1976). 100 Ilg of protein were digested in Tris pH 8.8 in 1 M Urea and 5% acetonitrile with 1 Ilg of trypsin (Calbiochem) for 12h at 37°C. The sample was reduced in 2 mM OTT and then re-digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were directly subjected to LC-MSIMS or additionally diluted in 0.1 % acetic acid and separated by propyl sulfate chromatography (Link, Eng et al. 1999) using a discontinuous gradient in 50 mM steps to 850 mM and then 1.0 M NaCI creating 15 fractions. All the digested samples were collected by zip tip eluted in 2 III and diluted to 20 III and manually loaded via a 20 III loop of a Rheodyne injector on to the column (Marshall, Jankowski et al. 2004). Samples and controls were resolved separately by CIS reversed phase

chromatography (Vydac O.3mm 10, 15 em column). Samples were analysed over a 90 minute gradient from 5% to 65% acetonitrile with a flow rate of 21l1lmin with an Agilent 1100 series capillary pump via a metal needle to form an electro-spray (McCombie, Adams et al. 1992) into a Decca XP-lOO ion trap (Thermo Electron Company). MSIMS data files from the LC-ESI-ion trap analysis were searched against a non-redundant library of proteins, cDNAs, EST (McCombie, Adams et al. 1992) and genomic DNA using SEQUEST (Yates 1998). digestion was done with trypsin only fully tryptic peptides were accepted.

Screening and Analysis

Data set of proteins putatively associated with phagocytosis was obtained through visual inspection of LC-MSIMS data obtained through LARC of IgG opsonized microbeads (Jankowski, Zhu et al. 2008). To account for non-specific binding, data from control experiments were screened. The presence of three unique peptides and a score of at least 2400 (Chelius, Huhmer et al. 2002) was used as the basis of acceptance of proteins in the construction of These conditions represent 99%

protein interaction models of FcyR mediated phagocytosis.

probability (Cargile, Bundy et al. 2004) of a protein presence in the pathway. Proteins that met the criteria above were examined for interacting partners from the same data set using iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2004). From the interacting partners interaction models (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005) were created and exported into Cytoscape (Shannon, Markiel et al. 2003), String (Jensen, Kuhn et al. 2009) and Osprey (Breitkreutz, Stark et at. 2003) where they were merged leading to improvements in model visualization through the application of different algorithms.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting

RAW264.7 lysates were probed for PAK2, 3, 4 and 6. RAW lysates were prepared by scraping cells grown to 80,90% confluency in 75crn2 flask inAMEM+lO%FBS. Approximately 5 ml of 2xSDS,PAGE sample buffer containing around 5mM PMSF, 5mM AEBSF, 5mM EDTA and eukaryotic protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the scrapped cells and immediately denatured for 10min at 100°C. Approximately 50J,tl of cell lysate along side a

molecular weight marker (MWM) were run on a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel with 4% stacking and 7% separating gels (Schagger, Borchart et al. 1987). Proteins from SDS,PAGE

The membrane was stained with Coomassie stain

without acetic acid, destained with 50% methanol, dried and marked with a pencil to indicate the location of the MWM. The membrane was then soaked in 100% methanol to fully de stained and blocked with either 5% skim milk in PBS+O.l% Tween (PBST)or 5%BSA+l% donkey serum in PBS+O.l % Tween for 30min. The membrane was washed 3 times with PBST and then primary anti bodies were added for 30 min, then washed 3 times. The membrane was incubated with 1: 10000 dilution of secondary HRP conjugated antibody in PBST for 30 min, then washed extensively with PBST and developed with ECL developing solution (Haan and Behrmann 2007). PAK2 - blocked with 5%BSA+ 1%DS in PBST, 1: 100 goat anti-PAK2 (sc7117, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 5%SM in PBST.

Immunostaining
Cells were scrapped and grown on 2.5 cm glass cover slips in 6 well plates in I mL AMEM+10% FBS. Cells were grown for 24-48hrs until-30% confluency. Sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or 2 Ilill polystyrene beads were incubate at a room temperature for 30min with rabbit anti-SRBC or human IgG, respectively, then washed 3x with PBS (Marshall, Booth et a1.

31

2001). Cells were incubated with SRBC or polystyrene beads for 5-7min at 37°C, then washed 3x with ice cold PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed 3x with PBS and put into 5% glycine in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with PBS+O.1% TritonX-lOO, washed 3 times with PBS and blocked with 5%SM in PBS. Primary and secondary Cy-3

conjugated antibody concentrations were 1:25 and 1: 10000, respectively, diluted in PBS. Slides were mounted with Dako mounting media (Dako, Denmark) and allowed to dry overnight in the dark. Confocallaser scanning microscope (LSM) was used to analyze cell staining.

Transfections
Competent DH5a cells were transformed with different plasmid vectors of GFP fused to endogenous proteins. Transformed cells were plated on selective LB media and incubated at 37°C o/n. A single colony was picked and grown in 3mL of selective LB media. 100mL of

selective LB media was then inoculated with the 1OO~ of starter culture and grown in a shaker over night at 37°C. DNA was extracted from 100mL cultures with MaxiPrep Kits (Quaigen). RAW macrophages were grown on coverslips in 6 well plates inAMEM+10%FBS o/n at 37°C with 5%C02. Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, USA) was used

according to manufacturers directions. Transfected cells were grown o/n at 37°C with 5%C02. Cells were fed SRBCs opsonized with rabbit anti-SRBC and images were taken with LSM.

Double stain phagocytosis assay
RAW264.7 cells were grown on cover slips in AMEM+lO%FBS in 6 well plates for 24-48 hours at 37°C with 5% C02. Cells were transfected with EGFP-PAK2, EGFP-PAK3,

Transfected RAW264. 7 macrophages were incubated with bead~ for 2 hours then washed 3x with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed 3x with PBS and 5% glycine in PBS was added to each well for 30 min. 1: 10000 diluted in PBS Cy5-conjugated to anti human IgG was added to each well and allowed to incubate to 30 min. Cells were then washed 3x15 min in PBS and mounted with Dako mounting media and dried overnight. Images were taken with a scanning laser confocal microscope. The number of beads engulfed was counted for all the transfected cells; number of beads engulfed by cells with empty GFP vector, wild type and dominant negative constructs was then compared usingANOVA.

RESULTS

LARC

After manual screenmg of LC-MSIMS positive and control data, a list of proteins involved in uptake of IgG-opsonized particles was generated. Selected spectra are illustrated in
Figure 10. Proteins identified through LARC are summarized in Table 1. Nearly 900 proteins

were identified including channels and receptors. Of those 341 have at least three interactions with other proteins on that list, as determined by the Osprey interaction network builder algorithm. Fc receptors as well as co receptors were detected. Proteins such as serine and

tyrosine kinases and phosphatases were detected. Proteins that act on membrane lipids such as PIP5K, PBK, PLD, PLC, PLA2, SHIP and their numerous isoforms were detected. Rho family

GTPases including Rho, Rac, Cdc42 and PAKs including GEFs and GAPs specific for those proteins were identified.
Arp proteins, coronin, myosins, dyneins, profilin, cofilin, filamins,

tropomyosin, dynamin are other proteins detected and associated with the cytoskeletal alterations during phagocytosis in neutrophils. Two classes of PBK were observed. The p110 subunit which is required for FcyR

mediated phagocytosis by macrophages (Leverrier, Okkenhaug et al. 2003) was identified with 9 different peptides with a score of 4369.13. PBKC2y had 11 unique peptides with a correlation score of 5739.68. PBKC2a was also detected and is involved in Ca2+ dependent inactivation of MLCP by ROCK (Yoshioka, Sugimoto et al. 2007) and thus stimulation of myosin based contractile activity.

The presence of the Class I and Class II PI3K can be expected through the importance of PIP2 and PIP3 as second messengers that can lead to activation of PKC, PLD, PLC and other enzymes that act on membrane lipids. PLD2 had 20 different peptides with 4 of them

phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues while PLDI had 9 different peptides correlated with SEQUEST. cPLA2S had 8 different peptides with nothing found in controls. PKC theta was identified with 8 different peptides. Rho family GTPases playa dominant role in particle uptake (Greenberg and Grinstein 2002), consistent with this a number of Rho GTPases were detected by LARC, including Cdc42 through 4 peptides and a total correlation score of 136346.39, and Rac2, which is involved in activation of p67phox subunit of NADPH oxidase (Bokoch 2005), was identified with different peptides and a score of 105143.33. 3850.29 with 0 control. four

Akt was detected with 3 peptides, a .score of

One of the functions of Akt is activation of p47phox of phagocyte and is dependent on PI3K activity in human

NADPH oxidase (Chen, Powell et al. 2003) neutrophils (Tilton, Andje1kovic et al. 1997).

LARC did not detect some of the proteins thought to be associated with phagocytosis. ARF6 which was shown to have a function in cytoskeletal rearrangements beneath the phagocytic cup (Zhang, Cox et a1. 1998) was not detected. However its activator PORI that functions downstream of Rac (D'Souza-Schorey, Boshans et a1. 1997) was detected. LIMK1I2, effectors of Cdc42 and Rac (Greenberg and Grinstein 2002), were detected with scores not significant for acceptance in the protein model. Protein detected with scores below the threshold could be activated away from the receptor or have very low abundance or displaced during the processing.

37

A large number of proteins was identified including peptides that were correlated to proteins previously known to be involved in particle uptake along with the novel proteins. Identification of different protein isoforrns was possible which is important since they may have different functions, cellular distributions or play a role at different stages of the process. Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) of 4 different classes were identified by LARC, specifically
DGK~l,

02,

E, ~

and

t.

DGK is involved in production of PA from DAG, which together may

function as second messengers modulating activity of enzymes such as PIP5K (Jenkins, Fisette et al. 1994) and PKOyl (Jones and Carpenter 1993). DGK isoforrns contain different domains

which alter their function and localization. Class I DGKs (a,~,y) have a Ca2+ binding domain and are activated in Ca2+ presence with
DGK~

colocalizing with actin filaments. Class II DGKs (0,

11, K) contain PH like domains on its N-terminus which may be involved in lipid interactions. Class III DGKE has a preference for arachidonoyl-D (Goto, Hozumi et al. 2008). The only

member of Class IV, DGK1; is associated with the nucleus and is transported into the cytoplasm and was found to be expressed in lung macrophages (Katagiri, Ito et al. 2005). Low abundance regulatory proteins believed to be relevant to Fc receptor (Greenberg, Chang et al. 1994) were identified through LARC with significant scores. False positive

identification of proteins was minimized by only accepting proteins with at least three distinct peptides correlated to the protein. Possible incorporation of false positives into the protein model is further reduced by having control experiments. Reliability of the data from tandem mass spectrometry of the Fc receptor is supported through the presence of peptides having at least three daughter ions in a row from the b or y ion series (DeSouza, Diehl et al. 2005).

38

The quality of the data is seen from the presence of sharp, discrete and resolved peaks with separation time of less than lOs. Shape and distribution difference in the chormatograms of the elution profiles between positive and controls permits to account for presence of the proteins that are not specifically involved in the Fc receptor complex.. Variation in elution conditions including change in salt concentrations led to identification of a greater number of proteins associated with phagocytosis (Figure 11). Further increase in the detection of proteins came from different incubation times, since some proteins are present at different stages of engulfment.

Table 1. LARC generated data set of proteins that may be involved during FcyR mediated phagocytosis in human neutrophils. Proteins that were accepted to specifically associate with the activated supramolecular Fey receptor complex had a total cumulative score of at least 2400, a minimum of thee different peptides and low scores in the control experiments. Those proteins that did not meet this criteria were not added to the list. Grey highlighted lines represent the search terms that were used to produce a set of proteins that are listed in that section.

Models o/supramolecular Fq receptor complex/orm human neutrophils
The generated networks represent detailed protein-protein interactions during FcyR mediated phagocytosis in human neutrophils. Probability of false positives is minimized by

requiring at least three interacting partners of each protein and .that all of the protein interactions in the network come from previously published sources. Incorporation of the interacting proteins into the network was made possible by availability of iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005). Three different algorithms were used to build interaction networks - Cytoscape (Shannon, Markiel et al. 2003), Osprey (Breitkreutz, Stark et al. 2003) and STRING (Jensen, Kuhn et al.

2009) (Figures 7, 8, 9). From the generated models list of proteins that are predicted to playa
central role in phagocytosis were compared (Table 2). From the consensus between the models
prot~ins

such as Src, Rac, Cdc42, NOX, PI3Ks and PLCs were found to playa central role in the These proteins were previously impllicated in

Fc receptor supramolecular complex.

phagocytosis, suggesting accuracy of LARC. Although few proteins identified were found to vary between models there was a close degree of an agreement on critical proteins that were previously established in FcyR mediated phagocytosis (Jankowski, Zhu et al. 2008).

Figure 12. Th e netH'ork of interacting proteins generatedj;'om application of Osprey.
341 proteins and 1971 known interactions were detected with at least three interactions in the data set. A global dual spoked ring layout was used, where proteins in the outer ring represent those that are predicted to playa more important role in phagocytosis based on the number of interactions which was obtained through data mini ng by iHOP.

Figure 13. The network of interacting proteins generated with Cytoscape. Cytoscape is one of the algorithms that is used in construction of protein interaction networks. Interaction data was obtained from iHOP. Spring embedded layout was used for interaction model visualization. Proteins that are clustered in the center are those that are predicted to play a more central role in FcyR mediated particle uptake.

The list of proteins established to be involved in FcyR driven phagocytosis in human neutrophils was input into the program, generating protein interaction network. The proteins that are found in the center of the model are those that are predicted to have an important function during phagocytosis .

p21 activated kinases

PAKs are likely associated with the Fc receptor supramolecular complex based on both human neutrophil and data gathered from a murine macrophage cell line. PAK2-4 and PAK6 were positively identified with LARC (Table 3). The presem;:e of these proteins in both data obtained with human neutrophils and RAW264.7 cells supports that they are involved in Fc receptor mediated particle uptake. PAK2 and PAK4 were predicted to play an important role during phagocytosis via the application of interaction model building algorithms. Specific peptides identified with LARC and correlated with the proteins are summarized in Table 4. These peptides were then searched using BLAST to confirm the protein sequence correlation and the presence of those peptide fragments within the published protein sequences
(Figure 16). All of the peptides that were identified with LARC were found within the protein

sequence returned from BLAST queries. Selected LC-MSIMS spectra of PAK2-4 an PAK6 is illustrated in Figure 17. The presence of these proteins in macrophages, and specifically at the site of particle uptake was confirmed by western blotting, immunostaining and cell transfections with GFP fusion to PAKs.

Western blotting ofPAKs The presence ofPAK2-4 and PAK6 in RAW264.7 macrophage celllysates was confirmed using Western blotting (Figure 18). A band around 58kDa upon incubation with goat polyclonal antibody against PAK2 corresponds to the presence of PAK2. Ooat polyc1onal antibody against PAlO detected a band at 66kDa which corresponds to the presence of PAK3 in cell lysates. PAK4 presence was detected with anti PAK4 rabbit monoclonal antibody which yielded a strong band around 66kDa. PAK6 western blot shows two bands one at the weight of around 80kDa which corresponds to full protein.

Presence of these proteins in RAW lysates was confirmed with western blotting.

Immunostains ofPAX proteins

Localization of PAK2, 3, 4 and 6 to the cell membrane near the site of engulfment of IgG opsonized particles was observed through staining of formaldehyde fixed cells with appropriate primary antibodies and detected with the addition of Cy-3 conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with a laser confocal microscope. PAK.2 has higher signal at the formation of the cup which indicates its accumulation during phagocytosis is a result of activation of the Fc receptor. PAK3 also shows some localization to the membrane around the engulfed sheep red blood celL PAK4 is seen to localize around the beads that are being internalized. Accumulation ofPAK6 is seen underneath the formed phagosome as well as around it (Figure 19). To take into account a possibility of non specific binding of secondary antibody and producing a false signal, cells were stained with the Cy-3 conjugated secondary antibodies alone. Images of the control experiments were taken with the same setting as those when primary antibodies were used. No fluorescence was observed on the beads or SRBC when macrophages were stained with secondary antibodies alone, meaning that signal when primary antibodies are added was only due the specific binding of the antibody to its target protein.

Transfection of wild type GFP-PAKfusion proteins

RAW cells were transfected with GFP constructs of wild type PAK2-4 and PAK6 to confinn their localization at the site of particle uptake. Dominant negative mutants of PAKs

were also transfected to see if these proteins have an effect on phagocytosis. ImageJ was used to analyze fluorescent signal intensity across line drawn through the cells. The presence of a well defined ring around the SRBC in the cell undergoing phagocytosis transfected with wt EGFP-PAK2 is interpreted as a localization of PAK2 to the cup around the engulfed particle. This is supported by the signal intensity of cells transfected with EGFP-PAK2 constructs where the signal is higher on membrane around the engulfed particle as compared to the rest of the cell (Figure 20A). The line scan corresponding to the fluorescence intensity

distribution throughout the cells shows unifonn intensity in the cell body with the signal much higher at the site of phagocytosis (Figure 20A2). Cells transfected with the EGFP-PAK.3 construct show some nuclear localization and protein accumulation at the site of phagocytosis (Figure 20B). Higher intensity around engulfed SRBC as compared to the rest of the cell can be seen from the signal intensity distribution which was quantified with Image J. PAK4 linked to GFP transfected cells show no nuclear localization. increase in intensity is observed at the fonnation of the cup (Figure 20C). A EGFP-PAK6 wild type construct localizes to the site of phagocytosis as seen from the image taken with the LSM and the distribution of signal intensity plot (Figure 20D). fluorescent signal is stronger around the engulfed SRBC as compared to the rest of the cell.

RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with dominant negative mutants of proteins linked to GFP. A reduction in protein accumulation at the cup was observed for all of the

transfections (Figure 21). Marked reduction is observed for PAK2 mutant. The PAK2 protein is present at the cup in the same intensity as in the rest of the cell as observed through application ofImageJ software to quantify fluorescent signal. A similar effect is seen with PAK3. The PAK6 mutant seems to accumulate at the site of phagocytosis however the degree of accumulation seems to be lower than that for the wild type EGFP-PAK6.

Effect of PAK wild type and dominant negative mutants on phagocytosis

Plasmids containing the GFP control alone, PAK2, PAK3, and PAK6 wild type and the corresponding dominant negative mutants were expressed in RAW macrophages and transefectants identified by the GFP fluorescence from live
cell~

during phagocytosis assays with

IgG coated beads. The expression of dominant negative mutants showed a significant reduction in Fc receptor function as measured by IgG coated microbead engulfment and internalization over two hours (ANOVA p=O.039). Analyzing the GFP control alongside both GFP WT and DN mutants for PAK2, PAK3 and PAK6 shown an overall F ration of 3.68 with a probability of p=O.0023. Cells transfected with PAK3 WT engulfed significantly greater number of beads and PAK2 DN internalized significantly less beads than the appropriate GFP tagged controls (Figure 22). Hence we observed that PAK proteins playa role in the function ofthe Fc receptor:

DISCUSSION
HPLC

LARC identified numerous proteins from the Fc receptor complex. Many of the identified proteins were previously shown to playa role in phagocytosis: Different subset of proteins was captured from the control beads. From the variation of the LC elution profiles (Figure 11) it appears that the chromatographs of the non-specific proteins are different from those that are involved with the activated supramolecular Fey receptor complex. Thus the use of ligand

receptor microbeads apparently captured a complex group of proteins from the surface of live cells that showed different chromatographic characteristics compared to non-specific binding to the similar control beads. From this we conclude that the Fc receptor supramolecular complex has likely been captured from the surface of the live human neutrophils.
LS-lt-fSIMS

Control experiments allowed for elimination of the false positive identification. Proteins present in the Fc complex LC-MSIMS data with significant scores are supported through previous biochemical data found in literature. Comparison to controls leads us to believe that the Fc receptor was captured. Close to 900 proteins that have a positive score of minimum of 2400 and are either absent from the controls or have non-significant scores as compared to the Fc LCMSIMS application. The list of specific proteins included integral membrane proteins, the

cytoskeletal and many associated proteins. The list of proteins associated with the ligand coated microbeads contained specific members of the Fc receptor family and many proteins that are known to associate with the membranes and cytoskeleton in contrast to the control beads. Hence a large number of proteins were observed to be specifically associated with the ligand coated
81

microbeads at the site of the activated receptor complex. From the LC-ESI-MS/MS data we conclude that the Fc receptor complex was differentially captured from the surface of live cells by its cognate ligand IgG affixed to microbeads. Stringent criteria for protein acceptance into positive LARC experiments such as the presence of the score of at least 2400 and presence of at least three different tryptic peptides, compared to control experiments for non specific binding, minimized the possibility of false positive acceptance of proteins into the protein interaction models.

Agreement with Literature
Proteins that have been established to associate with the Fc receptor pathway by previous genetic and biochemical experiments were specifically observed on the ligand coated microbeads. Members of the Fc receptor superfamily itself, Src, Syk, PI3K, PLC, PLD, NOX, Rae, Cdc42, actins and myosins have been shown to playa role in phagocytosis (Greenberg and Grinstein 2002) and were detected with LARC. Hence it appears that the use of LARC has

successfully captured many proteins that are known to be tightly associated with Fc receptor function. However, there were hundreds of new proteins identified by LARC that might be

associated with the Fey receptor singaling. Hence, further protein interaction modeling might assist in the depiction of the interactions between these various proteins and the level of their association with the Fc receptor supramolecular complex.

Protein-Protein Interaction ~fodels
The model of Fc receptor complex that arises from protein interaction networks is in agreement with the literature. IHOP was found to efficiently assist with the examination of the genetic and biochemical literature to reveal the interactions of the proteins detected from LARC

82

or their homologues in a variety of heterologous cells and conditions. After filtering for proteins from the Fc ligand specific data that showed at least three previous interactions with the primary data set, the basis for a model of protein-protein interactions was revealed. different protein-protein interaction algorithms to calculate
~e

We used three

central or nodal proteins that

might exert the greatest influence on the regulation of the entire receptor supramolecular complex. All three programs revealed that members of the Src, PI3K, Cdc42, NOX complex, PLC, PLD, Racl, RhoA, MAPK., dynamin-2, NOS2 and others are apparently central interactors in the Fc receptor complex in agreement with previous experiments. However hundreds of new proteins and isoforms not previously known to associate with the activated Fc receptor were detected and from this we conclude that LARC has the capacity to capture most previously established interactors and many novel members of a receptor pathway.

p21 Activated Kinases (PAK)
The Fc receptor is somewhat unique in its capacity to drive actin assembly and thus to form the pseudopods that may reach out from the cell to capture IgG coated particles of greater than 1 micron in size. These particles include bacteria that are recognized by the adaptive

immune system. PAK kinases are thought to be regulated by the Rho GTPase family to drive actin formation (Eswaran, Soundararajan et a1. 2008). P21 activated kinases were found to be associated with the activated Fc receptor from the LC-MSIMS data. PAK2, PAK3, PAK4 and PAK6 were predicted to playa role in FcyR mediated phagocytosis in both human neutrophils and murine macrophage cell lines (Tables 3, 4). From the protein interaction models that were constructed with Cytoscape, Osprey and String, PAK2 and PAK4 were predicted to playa more important role during phagocytosis (Table 2). Because of the agreement between neutrophils and

83

macrophage data means that it is likely that PAKs play an important role in Fc mediated phagocytosis and that LARC shows reproducibility between the receptor complexes captured from live human primary cells or cultured murine macrophages.
Western Blots

Protein expression of selected proteins detected with LARC was confirmed with Western Blots. PAK2, PAK3, PAK4 and PAK6 were detected with Western Blotting in RAW264.7 macrophages (Figure 18). The bands that were observed on Western Blots correspond to the correct preited molecular weights of these proteins. The Western blot results indicate that the proteins significantly detected by LC-ESI-MSIMS (Chelius, Huhmer et aL 2002) can be unambiguously confirmed by entirely independent biochemical methods. Detection of these

proteins in an isolated receptor complex would likely support detection of these proteins with the LC-MSIMS at the activated Fcr receptor complex.
Laser Confocal ~ficroscopy

Putative Fc receptor associated proteins can be further suported by immunostaining and the use of GFP fused protein expression. Based on the presence of PAK2-4 and PAK6 in the murine macrophage cell line as confirmed with Western blotting, PAKs were immunostained to see whether they associate with the Fe receptor. PAK2, PAK3, PAK4 and PAK6 were found to be present in the phagocytic membrane around the IgG opsonised polystyrene microbe ads or sheep red blood cells (Figure 22). Furthermore, PAK2 and PAK6 show accumulation at the site of phagocytosis, as believed from the higher fluorescent signal present at the cup formation as compared to the rest of the cell body. Some signal increase is observed around the engulfed particle when formaldehyde fixed cells were stained with antibodies specific for PAK3 and

84

PAK4. The presence of PAKs on the fonning phagosome, as observed from LSM images of the immunofluorescent staining, potentially supports the idea that the protein capture and identification with LARC is a suitable method of detection of proteins at the activated Fcy receptor. The differential staining is consistent with selective enrichment of some signal factors at the site of the active receptor. To further support validity of LARC, cells were transfected with GFP constructs of PAK proteins expressed in macrophages (Figure 20). Similar data was gathered with the live cell

imaging of the transfected cells as that with the immunostaining of fixed cells. EGFP-PAK2 and EGFP-PAK6 are seen to accumulate around the engulfed red blood cells during phagocytosis. This is further supported from the fluorescent intensity plots, constructed with ImageJ, which show a higher signal intensity around the engulfed particle. Higher intensity around the IgG opsonised particle may indicate involvement of these proteins in the Fc receptor function. EGFP-PAK3 shows a slightly higher signal intensity, which could potentially localize to the activated Fey receptor. The PAK4-GFP construct is seen to be present in the membrane around the engulfed particle. Accumulation of PAKs during phagocytosis of IgG opsonized particles is evidence of their association with the activated Fey receptor, whether directly or indirectly. Hence we conclude that LARC is able to capture proteins recruited to the plasma membrane sub domain surrounding the activated Fc receptor complex as a result of Fc receptor interaction with the ligand coated microscopic particles.
Role of PAK in Receptor Function

The experiments with GFP labeled controls, wild type PAK proteins and their corresponding dominant negative mutants have shown that the specific isofonns of PAK that

85

were shown to be tightly associated with F c from both human primary cells and murine macrophages playa role in receptor function. The general enhancement of receptor function by expression of all three wild type kinases compared to the general trend of inhibition from their corresponding mutants shows that while PAKs are required for Fe function there is redundancy derived from the multiple isoforms. The significant enhancement of receptor function observed from the expression of the PAK3 and marked loss receptor function in the presence of the PAK2 DN indicates that individual PAK proteins have a significant effect on the function of the Fe supramolecular complex

86

FUTURE OBJECTIVES

Additional independent experiments explaining dominant negative PAK-GFP constructs are required in order to obtain stronger statistical correlation about the functional importance of p21 activated kinases during phagocytosis. Repetition of these experiments with different GFP mutants will be an asset since a particular mutation may not fully impair protein function under different circumstances. Silencing RNA experiments would be an asset to this project and would provide valuable data regarding the effect of p21 activated kinase knockouts on phagocytosis. Experiments with application of pharmaceutical agents blocking PAKs would further yield an insight into their function (Eswaran, Soundararajan et a1. 2008). All of the mentioned

experiments would further improve the quality of already existing data and would prove validity ofLARC without any ambiguity.

87

CONCLUSION

Chromatographic, mass spectrometric, Western blot, calculations from the literature, immunocytological, GFP fusion and mutatant expression data all show that LARC captured the activated Fe receptor complex from the surface of live primary human cells in agreement with previous results from murine macrophages. Data gathered here indicate that PAK2, PAK3,

PAK4 and PAK6 are recruited to and may playa functionally significant role in Fc receptor mediated phagocytosis. Moreover, the detection and presence of Fc specific proteins and

subsequent calculations support a general case for the capture and identification of proteins associated with an activated receptor complex through application of Live-cell Affinity Receptor Chromatography.
