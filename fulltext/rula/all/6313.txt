BEHAVIOR OF REINFORCED HIGH AND ULTRA HIGH

STRENGTH CONCRETE BEAMS

Shahid Mohammad Neaz Master of Engineering, Civil Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada, 2011

ABSTRACT

Load-deflection behaviour of reinforced beams with high strength concrete (HSC) and ultra high strength concrete (UHSC) were studied based on experimental investigations. Four concretes including one HSC and three UHSC were considered for construction of beam specimens. Two different cross-sections of reinforced beams namely Type A and Type B. were considered for testing under single point loading. In addition, three, sets of Type B beam were tested with three different shear span to depth ratio (aId) for each concrete mix. The test results confirmed that flexural strength of fibre reinforced concrete increases with the increase of compressive strength - of concrete and the initial stiffness of UHSC are very high compared to HSC. It was observed that Type B beam with aId ratio less than 2 show the pattern of shear failure. As such, a theoretical model was studied to verify the performance and the shear load capacity of beams.

Introduction
1.1 Introduction

Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is a composite material made primarily from hydraulic cements, aggregates and discrete reinforcing fibers that are uniformly distributed and randomly oriented. The fibers that are randomly distributed in the matrix act as crack arrestors. Once the matrix cracks under tension, the debonding and pulling out of fibers dissipate energy leading to a substantial increase in toughness (ACI Committee 544). The main areas of FRC applications are slabs-on ground, tunnel linings, and precast and prestressed concrete products. Recently, elevated slabs of steel fiberreinforced concrete (SFRC) have been successfully used where fibers provide the primary reinforcement. A wide range of FRC systems, including glass fiber-reinforced concrete (GFRC), engineered cementitious composite (ECC), slurry-infiltrated concrete (SIFCON), and fiber-reinforced ultra high strength concrete (UHSC) I ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) are in use in the industry (Chote and Barzin. 2009). Within these different fibres, the character of fibre reinforced concrete changes with varying concrete fibre materials, geometries, distribution, orientation and densities. The applications of UHSC/UHPC are limited to few market sectors due to lack of standard guidelines for - design procedures. We know that steel reinforced concrete is the most widely used structural material for construction in the world. Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete structures subjected to deicing salts and/or aggressive environments constitutes the major cause of their deterioration, leading to costly repair and rehabilitation and significant reduction in service life. In an effort to slow and/or prevent infrastructure deterioration, it has become a primary concern for scientists and engineers to mitigate the corrosion of - steel rebar and to look for alternative reinforcing materials to use in the place of steel to prevent corrosion altogether "(Achillides and Pilakoutas, 2004). Fibre reinforced concrete with steel fibre especially UHSC/UHPC also provides a solution to this problem. Tests have shown that though the fibres located close to the surface may corrode slightly, but this superficial corrosion does' not lead to the mechanical properties of the concrete (Rossi,1998). Studies also show that specimens with service level cracking in aqueous solutions (with or without chlorides) exhibit autogenous healing at the cracks (Para nt, 2003; Pimienta and Chanvillard, 2004). Steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) possesses many excellent dynamic performances such as high resistance to explosion and penetration, as compared to plain concrete and even the traditionally reinforced concrete in civil and defence engineering. Findings also indicate that SFRC is a· better energy absorbing and impact reSisting

1

material. For example, the steel fibrous concrete is six times better in receiving impact loads than the non-fibrous concrete. SFRC such as UHSC/UHPC has gained wide acceptance in a variety of applications in recent years, including industrial floors, hydraulic structures, bridge decks, airport pavements, explosion and penetration resistant structures, etc (Wang et aI., 2008).

1.2

Project Objectives

The use of HSC and UHSCfUHPC in construction can improve strength, ductility and durability performance of infrastructures as well as can provide better service life, lower maintenance and

~conomy.

The use of UHSC/UHPC in construction is new and veri limited research has been

conducted to study the structural performance of such concretes. The objective of this project is to investigate the strength and deformation characteristics of high strength concrete (HSC) and fiber reinforced ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC)/ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). The effects of various parameters such as concrete types, concrete strength (ranging from 70 MPa to 180 MPa) and
,

shear span-depth ratio (afd) on strength characteristics of reinforced beams with shear and longitudinal reinforcements are studied.

Background, Literature Review and Design Codes

2.1

High-Performance Concrete (HPC)

The American Concrete Institute (ACI) defines high-performance concrete (HPC) as concrete meeting special combinations of performance and uniformity requirements that cannot always be achieved routinely when using conventional constituents and normal mixing. placing and curing practices. A highperformance concrete is something which demands much higher performance from concrete as compared to performance expected from routine concrete. Strength criteria of HPC include compressive strength. modulus of elasticity. shrinkage and creep; and durability criteria include freezethaw. scaling, abrasion and chloride permeability. Specification of HPC often requires the concrete to meet several criteria. HPC has high strength of 70-140 MPa @ 28 to 91 days (ASTM 39), high early compressive strength of 20-30 MPa @ 3-12 hours or 1-3 days (ASTM 39), and high early flexure strength of 2-4 MPa @ 3-12 hours or 1-3 days (ASTM 78) (Rossi, 2008) .

Ultra High-Performance Concrete (UHPC)

With the demand of further higher strength, researcher has introduced Ultra High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) that produced a very dense and high compressive' strength. The Association FranQaise de Genie Civil Interim Recommendations for Ultra High Performance Fibre-Reinforced
"

Concretes (2002) states that UHPC tends to have the following characteristics: compressive strength is
greater than 150 MPa, internal fibre reinforcement ,to ensure non-brittle behavior, and high binder content with special aggregates. Further, UHPC tends to have very low water content (less than 0.2) and can achieve adequate rheological properties through a combination of optimized granular packing and the addition of high-range water reducing admixtures (Benjamin and Jussara, 2007). Its tensile strength is limited to around 8MPa and UHPCs can be very brittle. To solve these problems, it was natural for researcher to add fibres. Three major types of steel fibre-reinforced UHPCs exist today: Type 1: UHPCs with high proportions of short fibres. The fibre content for this product is between 5% and 10% by volume, and the fibres do not exceed 6 mm in length. The fibres enhance the tensile strength of the concrete, but they do little to boost ductility. The material is therefore used in structures with high percentages of traditional reinforcing bars (Rossi, 2008). 3

Type 2: UHPCs with intermediate proportions of long fibres. Examples include DUCTAL® and CERACEM®, introduced in France in 1995 and 1998, respectively. Fibre contents for these products ranges between 2% and 3% by volume, and the fibre are between 13 mm to 20 mm long. The fibres enhance the tensile strength and ductility of the concrete and are intended to replace all or part of the reinforcing bars that would normally be used in prestressed or reinforced concrete elements (RoSSi, 208). Type 3: UHPCs with very high proportions of fibres of various lengths. Example of this product is CEMTECMultiscale®, introduced in France in 2000. Th~ fibre content of this product can be up to 11 % by volume and the fibres can range from shorter than 1 mm and up to 20 mm long. The fibers significantly increase both the tensile strength and ductility of .. . the concrete and can replace all the traditional reinforcing bars in an element. Just as with fiber-reinforced

composites formed using an organic matrix, the matrix in a Type 3

UHP~

transfers stresses

between fibers and ensures certain physical and chemical properties of the material (Rossi, 2008).

2.2.1 Ductility
A major goal for developers of UHPCs was the full or partial replacement of traditional reinforcing bars. So it's necessary that the selected UHPC ensures a certain level of ductility in structures. Ductility at the material scale is related to behavior before localized cracking-that is, before the peak stress is

Fig. 2.1: Determination of the ductility index

Ductility at the structural scale is conditional. First, the fibers must be well oriented with respect to macrocracks that develop in the structure. Second, the structure must not be too thick because a unit width of crack opening in a deep member produces less rotation and less ductility than, the same amount of c~ack opening in a shallower member (a purely geometrical effect). For UHPC, a reasonable maximum thickness is about three times the maximum fiber length. So, the maximum thickness for a UHPC with a maximum fiber length of 30 mm (1.2 in.) should be about 100 mm (4 in.). For prestressed structures, the fibers in the UHPC will generally be used to replace stirrups for shear behavior. Because shear cracks are more numerous and have smaller widths than flexural cracks in a reinforced concrete ·Iement of the same dimensions, the structural scale is less important.

2.2.2 Durability
, When considering UHPCs, it's natural to be, concerned about the potential for corrosion of the

st~'el

fibers. Even though fibers located close to the surface can corrode slightly, tests' show that. this superficial corrosion does not lead to a loss of mechanical properties (Rossi, 1998). Also, studies show that specimens with service level cracking in aqueous solutions (with and With~ut chlorides) exhibit autogenous healing at the cracks (Parant, 2003; Pimienta and Chanvillard,2004) .Type 2 UHPC with crack openings of 55 and 200 IJm (2.2 and 7.9 mil) showed 0% and 12% redu'ctions in bearing capacity after exposure to chloride solutions. After similar exposure, Type' 3 UHPC specimens showed a 14% increase in bearing capacity' compared with uncracked reference specimens stored in air. The crack widths on these specimens, however, weren't measureable. For very fine cracks less than about 50 IJm (2 mil). autogenous healing

to be sufficient to prevent corrosion damage. Unfortunately. no

tests have been conducted on UHPC specimens subjected to simultaneous fatigue loading and chloride exposure.

Flexural Design of Fiber-Reinforced Concrete

Despite the fact that FRC has been used in the construction industry for more than four decades, applications are still limited to a few market sectors. This is mainly due to the lack of standard guidelines for design procedures. To facilitate the design process, technical guidelines for FRC have been developed by RILEM (The International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures) Committee TC162·TDF for SFRC (Vandewalle et aI., 2000; Vandewalle et aI., 2002; Vandewalle et aI., 2003) during the past 15 years. The committee proposed a three point bending test of a notched beam specimen for material characterization. The elastically
\,

equivalent flexural strength at specific crack mount opening displacement (CMOD) is empirically related to the tensile stress-strain model. The compression response is described by a parabolic-rectangular stress-strain model. The strain compatibility analysis of a layered beam cross section is required to determine the ultimate moment capacity. Similar to the RILEM, German guidelines for design of flexural members use the strain compatibility analysis to determine the moment capacity (Teutsch, 2004). In the UK (Barr and Lee, 2004). the practice of FRC traditionally followed the Japanese Standard JCI-SF4 (JSCE·SF4); however, it has recently shifted toward the RILEM design methodology. The Italian . guideline is also based on load-deflection curves deduced from flexural or direct tension tests (di Prisco et aI., 2004). The current U.S. design guidelines for flexural members are based on empirical equations (Swamy et aI., 1975; Fischer, 2004). Particular types of fibers and natures of concrete were not specified in the guidelines. Henager and Doherty (1976) proposed a tensile'stress block for SFRC that is comparable with the ultimate strength design of ACI318-05. In this paper a design methodology for strain softening FRC is discussed for· ultimate strength and design for serviceability. The design procedures are based on theoretical derivations of Soranakom and Mobasher (Soranakom and Mobasher, 2007; 2008), in addition to ACI 318-05 and RILEM TC 162-TDF
~

(Vandewalle et aI., 2003).

2.3.1 Strain-Softening FRC Model
Tensile,and compressive response of strain-softening FRC such as steel and polymeric fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC and PFRC) can be Simplified to idealized stress-strain models as shown in Fig. 2.2 (a) and (b). In these materials, the contribution of fibers is mostly apparent in the post-peak tensile region, where the response is described by a decaying stress-strain relationship. It is possible, however, to

(Jp

for the softening response, which

According to the RILEM model (Vandewalle et aI., 2003) shown in Fig. 2.3, the ultimate tensile strain t3 is defined as 0.025. The ultimate compressive strain tcu is limited to 0.0035, which is the lower bound value of typical SFRC (Swamy and AI-Ta'an, 1981; Hassoun and Sahebjam, 1985), and the yield compressive strength for FRC is adopted as

The location of neutral axis parameter k can be derived by solving the equilibrium of internal forces. The moment can be computed from taking the force about the neutral axis, while the curvature is obtained by dividing top compressive strain with the depth of neutral axis.

Using these expressions, the moment M and curvature 4> represented in terms of their first cracking values (Met and 4>et) are defined as (2.9) (2.10) where band h are width and height of beam, respectively. The moment capacity at ultimate Compressive strain (A

Load and resistance factor design (LRFD) is based on the reduced nominal moment capacity ct>p Mn. exceeding the ultimate factored moment Mu that is determined by linear elastic analysis and load coefficients in accordance to AC1318-05 Section 9.2. The reduction factor ct>p addresses the uncertainty of using post-crack tensile strength in predicting ultimate moment capacity.

The nominal moment capacity Mn can be obtained by using Eq. (2.13) and (2.14) with the reduction factor (2.13)

Shear Strength of High-Performance FRC

Shear failure in reinforced concrete beams is generally catastrophic because of the brittle behaviour of plain concrete.

Shear failure occurs when the principal stress exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete and the principal crack propagate diagonally. by producing diagonal tension or '. shear compression failure modes,depending on the ratio between the shear span and the effective depth of the beams (Campione et 81.,2006). If the shear strength and shear toughness of concrete can , be improved, the shear failure of RC beam could be avoided and the behaviour of concrete could be changed from brittle to ductile. In both failure modes the addition of fibres in a suitable percentage and geometry produces a Significant increase in shear strength and in some cases can also change the failure mode shear to flexure. In these cases, fibres can partially substitute transverse stirrup~ and have

(opening, sliding and tearing). Research has clearly established the potential use of fibre reinforcement for increasing the shear capacity of RC beams (Calixto et aI., 2002; Dupont and Vandewalle, 2003)! Following sections will discuss different models in determining the shear strength of RC beams with stirrups containing fibre reinforcement

2.4.1 Narayan and Darwish (1987) Model
Narayan and Darwish proposed an equation for calculating the contribution of concrete and fibre to the shear capacity of RC beam, and the contribution of stirrups is calculated on the basis of the design codes .He proposed that the shear capacity of steel-fiber-reinforced RC beams

This approach is based on Eurocode 2 (CEN 1992). The contribution of fibres to shear capacity is independently com puted using toughness enhancement in flexure by the fibres. The shear capacity of beam is given by·

There are two deficiencies in the approach taken by RILEM. First, because FRCs behave differently in shear than in flexure (Mirsayah and Banthia, 2002), the use of flexure properties to determine the shear response makes limited sense. Second, since fibre is integral part of any FRC, their shear response should not be separated from the plain concrete.

2.4.3 Majdzadeh et al. (2005) Model
Majdzadeh et at proposed a new equation where the shear contribution of concrete, fibres and stirrups were taken into consideration. For contribution of the concr~te, a modified Eurocode 2 (CEN 1991) expression was used and for contribution of fibre, an equation based on the results of direct shear tests on FRC speCimens was used. To account for contribution of stirrups, the expression in Eurocode 2 was

Materials

The following sections discuss the materials and their corresponding properties used in this study. Three UHSC/UHPC mixes namely Ductal1, Ductal 2 and Ryerson concrete and one HSC namely King concrete were used. Ductal1 was produced to provide a compressive strength of above 150 MPa and Ductal 2 was produced to provide compressive strength of above 170MPa. Ryerson concrete was developed at Ryerson with compressive strength of about ,140 MPa. The general mix proportions are provided in Table 3.1 for Ductal1 and Ductal2.

the Ryerson Concrete was supposed to provide compressive strengths between 115-130 MPa, the specimens needed to be tested between 23-24 days after casting when they attained an average compressive strength of 128.6 fvlPa. It was essential to test the specimens within that time frame or consequently the specimens would continue to gain strength and exceed the desired compressive strength range . The compressive strength development of Ryerson Concrete is shown in Figure 3.2. The comp ressive strength attained for Ryerson Concrete appeared to reach a maximum value of 152 MPa after 75 days. The control cylinders had a standard deviation of 5.62 MPa and a coefficient of variation of 4.4%.

Testing

The specimens were tested in a testing set-up with a maximum load carrying capacity of 1400 KN. The load was applied through a single-ended actuator to the center of each specimen!.. which was supported on two steel rollers covering the entire width of the specimen. A LVDT was placed under the beam
~long

the loading point to measure the deflection. Fig. 3.6 shows the test setup. A computer aided data

acquisition system was used to monitor the load-central deflection response throughout loading history until failure of the specimens. Suring testing, over all behaviour including cracking, cracking propagation and failure models of the beams were observed.

The values of experimental loads are compared with those obtained from the model in table 5.1. Figure 5.6 shows the comparison of experimental and model predicted loads for a specific aid ratio of 1.0, 1.4 and 1.74. Experimentally predicted load was higher compared to theoretically predicted load predicted by Narayan and Darwish'model for beams with aid ratio 1.0. However, for beams with dId of ratio>

1.0, the model seems to over predict the shear capacity. Reasonably, Narayan and Darwish model failed to predict (significantly under predicted) the shear capacity of HSC (King) beams without fibre as the ratio experimental to predicted load is 3.81.

Conclusion and Recommendations
6.1 Conclusion

load-deflection behaviour and strength characteristics of reinforced beams with high and ultra high strength concretes are studied based on experimental investigation. The effect of concrete types (HSC or UHSC). concrete compressive strength (70 MPa to 175 MPa) and span to depth ratio (a/d) were studied. Four concretes including one high strength and three ultra high strength concrete were considered for the construction of experimental beam specimens. High strength concrete (HSC) was based on coarse aggregate with a compressive strength of 70 MPa while fibre reinforced ultra high strength concrete (UHSC) with no coarse aggregate had strength ranging between 135 MPa and 175 MPa. Two different cross-sections of reinforced beams namely Type A and Type B were considered for testing. All the load tests were conducted under single point loading and their load carrying capacities with deflections were compared. Three sets of Type B beam were tested with three different shear spans to depth ratio (a/d) of 1.0, 1.4 and 1.74 for each concrete mix. The following conclusions are drawn from the study:

·

The strength of HSC/UHSC beams increases with the increase of concrete compressive strength

·

The initial stiffness and ductility of fiber reinforced UHSC beams are found to be high compared with HSC (no fiber) beams with lower strength.

·

The shear capacity of HSC/UHSC beams decreases with the increase of ald. However, the trend of decrease is observed to be non-linear for UHSC and linear for HSC.

·

The theoretical model proposed by Naryan and prawish (1987) under-predicted the shear capacity of UHSC beam with aId

= 1.0 but o~er-predicted the shear capacity of beam with

aid > 1.0. Research is needed to develop theoretical models specifically suitable for
UHSC.

6.2

Recommendations for Future Work

Both the literature review and this study show that study on the strength and ductility behaviour of fibre reinforced UHSC/UHPC beams is still very limited. The following are some recommendations for future investigations:

31

Conduct beam tests without any shear or main reinforcement to determine the flexure and shear strength of HSC/UHSC beams and develop theoretical models/code based

provisions/modifications for design purposes.

Conduct further research to determine the long term durability and structural performance of HSC/UHSC in an aggressive environment.
