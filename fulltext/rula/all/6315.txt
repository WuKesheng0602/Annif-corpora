ABSTRACT
THE EFFECT OF ALKALIS FROM SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTING MATERIALS ON ALKALI-CARBONATE REACTION Steven Jagdat 2010, M.A.Sc., Department of Civil Engineering, Ryerson University While much research has been completed on Alkali-Aggregate Reaction (AAR) over the years, few studies have focused on the lesser known Alkali-Carbonate Reaction (ACR). With the increasing use of supplementary cementing materials (SCM), it is important to determine the effects of SCM on ACR. In this research, the concrete prism test was used to evaluate the reactivity of Pittsburgh aggregate when used with cement and a combination of one or two types of SCM. Several concrete prism mixes were completed using eight (8) different types of SCM including slag, silica fume, metakaolin, and five different types of fly ash. The results from the concrete prism test showed that all of the mixes tested were not effective in reducing the expansion due to ACR to levels below the CSA expansion limit (0.04% at 2 years). However, it was found SCM did help reduce expansion due to ACR on a marginally reactive aggregate. The Concrete Microbar test was completed to evaluate the test's validity on determining ACR aggregates with and without SCM. The results from this experimental program suggest that the microbar test should not be used for the acceptability of an aggregate. SCM with low-alkali contents such as metakaolin and CI-LA fly ash were found to help reduce the detrimental expansion of concrete due to ACR.

CHAPTER! Introduction
1.1.

Overview

Over the years, countries all over the world have seen significant distress and deterioration to their infrastructure. As part of the current stimulus package and economic restructuring, a large amount of government funding has been put towards the repair or reconstruction of many concrete structures. However, a major portion of these costs could be prevented if the concrete structures were designed from a durability standpoint. Concrete is the most widely used material in the world next to water. It is important as a society to be sustainable in our development of structures as many natural resources are being depleted. No longer should we only design for the compressive strength of concrete as most structural engineers do, but we should try to be sustainable in our production of concrete and design long lasting structures. In most cases, concrete usually fails from deterioration (wear and tear) rather than from structural deficiencies. This is why the durability of concrete should also be an important design factor when producing concrete structures. Concrete durability depends on many factors such as the type of cement used, the water to cement ratio, the environment the concrete is exposed to, and the type of aggregates used to name a few. For many years now, researchers have been investigating the use of different types of aggregate in concrete. The aggregate type is of utmost importance because it plays a vital role in how the concrete will behave and perform over the years. Reactivity of

aggregates can cause deterioration to many concrete structures including pavements, bridges, buildings, and dams to name a few. Certain aggregate constituents react with the alkaline pore solution in the concrete (Le. the cement paste) and a deleterious product results. The cement

- 1-

paste in concrete is a highly basic liquid (PH around 12.5) consisting mainly of dissolved alkali hydroxides in the fonn of potassium and sodium, with minor amounts of other elements such as calcium and sulphate. When these alkalis react with the aggregate in concrete, expansion will occur and can further lead to cracking and severe deterioration of the concrete. This reaction between the aggregates and the alkalis in the pore alkaline solution is known alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR). Alkali-aggregate reactions have become a great concern due to aggregate

durability problems and the poor quality concrete that may arise if the proper precautions are not taken. There are two main types of AAR, Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) and the lesser known Alkali-Carbonate Reaction (ACR). This thesis focuses predominantly on alkali carbonate

reaction and how the use of various supplementary cementing materials (SCM) effects the expansion in concrete due to ACR. The most common method of testing for ACR is by

perfonning a concrete prism test as outlined in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C1293. However, the disadvantage of this test is that it takes at least one (1) year to see significant results. Recently, RILEM has standardized a new test method called the concrete microbar test which can evaluate the reactivity of an aggregate within one month. As part of the ACR experimental program, concrete microbars were tested to evaluate the validity of the new RILEM AAR-5 test method, especially when SCM is used. This thesis also attempts to correlate the results of the concrete prism test with the RILEM microbar test for concrete mixes containing reactive carbonate aggregate (Pittsburgh), with and without SCM.

1.2. Objectives
The three (3) main objectives of this M.A.Sc. thesis are as follows: 1. To establish a database on the effects of alkalis from various SCM on the expansion due toACR. 2. To determine the effects of SCM on a marginally reactive aggregate and to determine if the alkalis from the SCM will activate the marginally reactive aggregate. 3. To evaluate the reliability and the validity of the concrete microbar test for ACR

1. Establishing a database for the effects of SCM on ACR
Very little work has been focused on the use of SCM on alkali-carbonate reactive aggregates. In fact, only one study (Rogers and Hooten, 1992) has ever dealt with using SCM such as slag, silica fume and fly ash. This thesis provides more extensive results on the effects of SCM on the expansion due to ACR. The concrete prism test was the main test used to evaluate the effects of SCM on the expansion due to ACR. While there are other tests to determine if an aggregate is alkali-carbonate reactive, the concrete prism test and the concrete microbar tests are the only test methods capable of testing the expansion of the conCrete containing SCM and not just the aggregate. The SCM included in the database includes slag, silica fume, metakaolin and five (5) different fly ashes.

2. Determining the effects of SCM on a marginally reactive aggregate
With the increasing use of SCM in the concrete industry, it is important to know if adding SCM to a concrete mix can cause a marginally reactive aggregate to have deleterious expansion. A

-3-

marginally reactive aggregate is considered to be an aggregate that has alkali-carbonate reactive constituents but does not exceed the CSA expansion limit of 0.04% after I-year. In this study, a marginally reactive aggregate was created by combining reactive Pittsburgh aggregate with non-reactive aggregates (i.e. aggregate dilution). The diluted mixes were combined with SCM to determine if the alkalis from the SCM would cause the expansion of the mix to exceed the CSA expansion limit.

3. Evaluation of the Concrete Microbar Test As mentioned, the benefit of the microbar test is that expansion results can be seen in one month compared to one year with the concrete prism test. However, this test has not been standardized by CSA or ASTM and its validity in determining alkali-carbonate expansive aggregates is still in question. Specific microbar mixes with the same composition as concrete prism mixes were made to make a comparison between the two tests. The concrete prism test is the more reliable test and has been standardized by CSA. ASTM, and local testing laboratories. As part of the evaluation of the concrete microbar test, the expansIons of the microbars were compared to the corresponding concrete prism expansion and a correlation between the two tests was attempted.

CHAPTER 2 Literature Review
The main objective of this thesis was to study the effects of various supplementary cementing materials (SCM), including slag, fly ash, silica fume and metakaolin, on alkali-carbonate reaction in concrete. Literature associated with this objective is reviewed in this Chapter.

2.1.

Alkali Aggregate Reactions (AAR)

Alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) was first recognized in 1940 by Stanton (1940) who noticed there was detrimental expansion of concrete through the reaction between cement and aggregate. This reaction was later termed alkali-silica reaction. There are two types of AAR namely, alkalisilica reaction (ASR) and alkali-carbonate reaction. Alkali-Carbonate Reaction (ACR) was later discovered in 1957 by Swenson (Swenson, 1957) and studied in the early 1960s (Hadley, 1961). In general, AAR is a deleterious reaction between certain types of reactive aggregate and the concrete pore solution. The pore solution of concrete is usually very basic or alkaline with a pH values typically greater than 12. Alkalis in the pore solution derive from the cement paste, SCM, as well as external sources alkalis such as deicers and groundwater. When these alkalis combine with the reactive aggregate and moisture, concrete deterioration occurs in the form of expansion and cracking. A brief background of ASR is provide in the following section, however, the rest of the review and this thesis concentrates more specifically on the lesser known ACR.

2.1.1.

Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR)

Alkali silica reaction (ASR) was first discovered as a concrete durability problem in the early 1940s. ASR involves the reaction between active silica constituents of an aggregate and the alkalis in pore solution. The aggregates in concrete are surrounded by the cement paste matrix. This paste has interconnected microscopic pores that water or ions in solution can easily migrate through. The moisture available from capillary pores and the migration of water through the interconnected pores is a part of the overall ASR.

The reactivity of silica in the aggregate depends on the type and forms of silica that are present in the aggregate. When silica is completely crystalline it is chemically and mechanically stable, although there are some exceptions. There are a few forms of crystalline silicon dioxides: quartz, tridymite and crystobalite. Quartz is stable unless it is microcrystalline or highly strained (Dent Glasser and Kataoka, 1981).

ASR can be considered to be a deterioration that affects the serviceability and the aesthetics of the structure, rather than its integrity because the crack width is usually between 0.1 mm and, in the extreme cases, 10 mm (Neville, 1996). Also, the crack depth is usually less than 25 mm. Combined with other forms of deterioration, such as chloride attack, ASR can cause extreme deterioration problems (Neville, 1996).

ASR has been recognized in more than 50 countries around the globe; it is likely that that problems associated with ASR exist in a larger number of countries, but concrete distress in several instances may have been attributed to other causes (Fournier and Berube, 2000). AAR

- 6-

related problems were first identified in Canada in the 1950s. Extensive research has been carried out on ASR over the past six decades. The main areas of research dealt within Canada and worldwide are as follows (Fournier and Berube, 2000):

Â·

Further understanding of the mechanisms involved in the deleterious process of ASR in concrete

Â·

Identifying the rock types or specific petrographic faces at risk and developing quick and reliable test methods to assess the potential alkali-reactivity of concrete aggregates.

Â· Â·

Developing specifications for preventing ASR in new concrete structures. Developing management actions for existing concrete structures affected by ASR.

2.1.1.1.

Alkali Silica Reaction Mechanisms

There have been many cases of ASR reported in most parts of Canada. The problem is fundamentally related to the increased solubility/instability of amorphous, disordered, poorly, micro or cryptocrystalline forms of silica in high pH solutions (Fournier and Berube, 2000). Two categories of ASR reactive rocks are recognized in Canada according to the silica form involved:

1- Rock types containing poorly crystalline or metastable silica minerals. Concrete structures that incorporate even as little as 1 to 2% of these silica minerals, has shown to greatly expand in only a few years; as long as the other components of ASR exist (Fournier and Berube, 2000).

-7-

2- Rocks that contain quartz having very fine quartz grains or some variety macro-granular quartz. This category is common in Eastern Canada; it is characterized by a delay of expansion and cracking of concrete that can take from 10 to 25 years to become apparent in the field when other conditions essential for ASR are present (Fournier and Berube,

2000).

The mechanism for most alkali silica reactive Canadian aggregates can be explained by two processes. First, the reactive silica, mostly found in the aggregates, combines with the alkali hydroxides found in the pore solution (which is mostly contributed by the cement). This reaction produces a gel-like substance known as alkali-silica gel. Secondly, when the concrete absorbs moisture the gel consumes this moisture and expands, depending on the characteristics of the gel. This process can also be explained as follow:

Â» Â»

Alkali hydroxide + reactive silica gel ~ reactive product (ASR gel) Gel reaction product + moisture --+ expansion

At tirst the gel is restrained from expanding into the cement pate; however, cracking occurs when the tensile stresses that are developed exceed the tensile strength of the cement paste. As soon as adequate micro cracking has occurred, the gel spread out freely through the cracks in the ccmcnt paste. It continues spreading, but generally loses its expansive properties by the absorption of calcium through an ion-exchange process with the hydrates of the paste (Fournier and Berube, 2000). The gel reaction product can be reproduced with very little water, but it will not produce damaging expansion if excess water is not available or cannot penetrate the paste. A high-quality low watcr-to-cementious ratio paste will add some protection but is not sufficient to prcyctlt damage on its 0\\11 (Rear et. aI., 1994).

2.1.1.2.

Conditions required for Alkali Silica Reaction to Occur

The alkali-silica reaction occurs between the alkalis in the cement paste and reactive silica found in aggregates. As mentioned previously, the three necessary components for ASR expansion to occur are the following: 1. Reactive form of silica. 2. Sufficient alkalis (usually from the cement) 3. Sufficient moisture within the concrete

The same requirements mentioned above are also required for ACR to occur with a reactive source of carbonate aggregate in place of silica. discussed more in detail in the ACR section 2.1.2. The requirements for AAR to occur are

2.1.1.3.

Mitigation Methods

Aggregate Selection The most successful measure against ASR is certainly the use of the non-reactive aggregates. However, this solution is often not practical or economical due to the availability of material close to the construction site and the cost of transportation.

Low-alkali cement and concrete: The use of low-alkali cement is a method of supporting ASR because alkalis are needed for the reaction to occur. Limiting the cement content of the mix will also lower the total available

-9-

alkalis in the concrete. Higher alkali contents results in more ASR reaction product, which can lead to more expansion (Leming and Nguyen, 2000). ASR can be considerably reduced or even prevented by use of low-alkali cement or by limiting the total alkali content of concrete under a limiting value. CSA recommends a limit for the concrete alkali content ranging from 1.7 to 3.0 kglm 3 Na20e, depending on the degree of reactivity of the aggregates.

Use of supplementary cementing materials The use of SCM reduces the permeability of the concrete, which reduces the ability of the gel to absorb water and expand (Neville, 1996). Alkali dilution, reduction of concrete permeability, and consumption of Ca(OH)z through pozzolanic reaction are also thought to play a role in the beneficial effect of SCM against ASR. These affects are important but are considered secondary compared to other methods (Shehata and Thomas, 2002). SCM's will be discussed further in Section 2.2.

2.2.

Alkali-Carbonate Reaction (ACR)

ACR was first recognized in Canada in 1957 (Swenson, 1957). Since then, many studies have been carried out throughout the U.S. and the rest of world. Although ACR studied for over 50 years now, there is no real consensus as to how the mechanism of ACR works. In simple terms, ACR is the reaction between the alkali hydroxides in the pore solution, usually derived from cement paste, and carbonate or dolomitic rock aggregate. In particular, it has been found that argillaceous dolomitic limestone, often found in Kingston, Ontario is very susceptible to ACR. The composition of the carbonate rock involved determines which type of reaction occurs. For example, non-dolomitic carbonate aggregate particles may develop reaction rims which

- lO-

dissolve more rapidly in dilute acid than the interior of the particle. Similarly, impure dolomitic limestone (that is, limestone composed of large dolomite crystals in a fine-grained calcite and clay matrix) aggregate particles may develop silica-enriched rims (Stokowski, 1997). The rims that form do not affect the concrete expansion itself, but may contribute to degradation of the aggregate.

2.2.1.

Requirements for ACR

In order for ACR to occur, there are three requirements that must be met (Leger, 1995). These requirements are listed below as follows: Â· Â· Â· Reactive carbonate aggregate High alkali (pH) pore solution from cement Sufficient moisture

As mentioned in Section 2.1.1, these requirements are very similar to the requirements needed for ASR to occur with the exception of the aggregate type. Other factors that associated with AAR and that can effect the expansion due to AAR are also discussed in this section.

2.2.1.1.

Presence of Reactive Aggregate

The first and most important requirement in order for ACR to occur is that there must be reactive carbonate aggregates used in the concrete. As mentioned previously, argillaceous dolomitic limestone is very susceptible to ACR. ASTM C 33 classifies the reactive carbonate aggregates as those containing calcite, fine clay particles and other detrital minerals scattered within the matrix of dolomite. It is believed the small clay particles expel as an impurity as the crystal

growth of the carbonate forms (Gillott, 1963). The clay minerals which have been reported most frequently are illite and chlorite. Dolomite is simply the common name for calcium-magnesium carbonate CaMg(C03)2. In the calcite, calcium (Ca) is sometimes partially replaced by

magnesium (Mg) in amount which vary from a fraction of a mole percent up to several mole percent. Ozol (1994) and Swenson (1967) determined which aggregates were more susceptible to ACR expansion based on their lithological characteristics. Alkali-expansive carbonate

aggregates are usually grey, very fine grained, dense and of close texture in hand sample (Gillott, 1975). They concluded that there is a potential for ACR expansion if the aggregate has the following physical characteristics: Â· Â· Â· Clay content, or insoluble residue content from 5 - 25% Calcite-to-dolomite ratio of approx. I: 1 Increase in the dolomite volume up to a point which interlocking texture becomes a restraining factor Â· Small size of the discrete dolomite crystals (rhombs) suspended in a clay matrix

2.2.1.2.

High Alkali Hydroxides in the Concrete Pore Solution

The reaction with the cement paste's alkalis is the second requirement for ACR to occur. The alkalis found in portland cement mainly come from feldspars, micas and clay minerals contained in the limestone and argillaceous material used as raw material in cement manufacture (Gillott, 1975). Alkalis are normally driven off to an appreciable extent during firing in the kiln but complete volatilization is inhibited by sulphates (Martin and Gibson, 1996) which are derived from the fuel used in firing or from gypsum. Alkalis can also come from principal minerals

- 12-

found in cement klinker (Fletcher 1969). The pore solution of concrete is highly alkaline, primarily a result of the sodium and potassium ions released during cement hydration. Excess alkalis are also derived from admixtures, mixing water, fly ash, GGBFS, silica fume, and external sources (CCAA 1996). The excess alkalis from SCM are a major focus of this thesis. Sodium hydroxide (NazO) and potassium hydroxide (K20) can both produce expansion in reactive aggregates. Swenson and Gillott (1960) reported that sodium hydroxide was more

aggressive than potassium hydroxide. An alkali content greater than 0.45% NazO plus 0.658% of the weight percentage K20 is considered to be the lowest possible alkalinity that can be use in order for there to be ACR (Swenson and Gillott, 1960). According to ASTM, low-alkali cement contains an alkali content of less than 0.60% NazO equivalent (NazOe). However, Hadley (1968) reported concrete containing some reactive aggregates and low-alkali cement, less than 0.60% NazOeÂ· still suffered damage due to ACR. The alkali hydroxides found in the pore

solution is normally related to the alkali content of the cement used. However, the amount of alkali content needed to initiate and sustain expansive or deleterious AAR varies from one aggregate to another (Fournier and Berube, 2000).

2.2.1.3.

Presence of Sufficient Moisture

The third requirement required for ACR to occur does not have anything to do with the concrete itself, but it deals more with the environment the concrete will be placed in. If ACR is to occur there must be a presence of an adequate amount of moisture. In Canada, any outdoor concrete will definitely be subjected to moisture due to the moistlhumid air, rain, sleet, snow, ice, etc. Concrete structures such as footings, bridge decks, dams and sidewalks are more likely to show

- 13-

signs of distress from ACR due to constant exposure to moisture and the atmosphere. ACR is not likely to oeclir if the concrete has an internal relative humidity less than 75 percent (CCAA 1996). Alkali-aggregate reactivity typically occurs in concretes that are exposed to internal

relative humidity of approximately 80 to 85% (Nevitle, 1996). Concrete takes up water from its external surroundings to replenish the self-desiccation losses caused by water movements within the material. Therefore, concrete that is located in a dry environment will generally not be susceptible to AAR.

It should be noted that ifany one of the requirements described in Section 2.l.2.1 is not met, then
ACR witl not occur.

2.2.1.4. Tcmperature

Other Factors That Are Commonly Associated with ACR

In gcneml, as the temperature aceclcmtes, the alkali-aggregate reaction increases. While the reaction of AAR increases with temperature, the sam,~ cannot be said about the expansion due to AAR. Studies (Lerch, t 956; Swenson and Gillott, 1960) reported that the expansion due to AAR increases with increase in temperature up to a certain point. For example, in ASR the greatest
cxp~ltlsion occurs at

3S c e, a minimum at 100e and no significant expansion at 60Â°C

(GuJmund$$l)ll, 1973). Figure :!-l shows the change in expansion of different alkali-reactive

aggregates 3t ditl'crent tempcmturcs (Gillott, (957).

Figure 2-1 Length change data for various sorts of alkali-expansive aggregate (Gillott, 1975)

Supplementary Cementing Materials/Pozzolans ASTM defines a pozzolan as "a silicecous or siliceous and aluminous material which in itself possesses little or no cementitious value but will, in finely divided form and in the presence of moisture, chemically react with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) at ordinary temperatures to form compounds possessing cementitious properties" (ASTM CI2S, 2000). Reduction of AAR has been achieved when certain types of SCM or pozzolans are added to the concrete mix. Suppression of expansion was reported by Johnston (1974) even when waste glass was used as coarse aggregate. While some materials work, the effectiveness of a pozzolan not only depends on the nature of the pozzolan itself, but also on the type of reaction that occurs when it combines with portland cement and an alkali-expansive aggregate. When pozzolans are calcined, they become more active and it is believe water is driven off by combination pairs of hydroxyls

- 15 -

attached to adjacent surface silicon atoms leaving strained silicon oxygen groups at the surfaces (Hockey, 1965). Pozzolanic reactions form supplementary cementitious compounds similar to calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H). Some pozzolans like fly ash for calcium aluminate silicate hydrates (C-A-S-H) which also acts as a cementing compound. The crystal chemistry of these compounds implies that water as well as calcium and hydroxyl are removed from the pore solutions by combination with the silica from the pozzolan (Gillott, 1975). Pozzolans ability to remove lime has been suggested as the most significant factor in reducing expansion due to AAR (Mather, 1952). Another benefit of pozzolans is that they may lower the hydroxyl (OH-)

concentration to the point at which the amount of expansive reaction is significantly reduced (Diamond in Gillott, 1975). Pozzolans can also cause changes in amount of reaction, decrease in permeability of the cement paste, and change in solution concentrations so that the gradient no longer favours migration of water into the potentially expansive aggregate (Gillott, 1975). The change in permeability due to different pozzolans will also be briefly focused on in this thesis.

Test Methods for Determining Aggregates Susceptible to ACR

Before an aggregate is used in concrete, tests must be performed on them to determine if they are suitable for concrete or if they may cause some sort of hazard to the general public. When it comes to testing ACR, there are many different tests that can be performed. The test methods described below are of great importance when it comes to accepting an aggregate that may be susceptible to ACR. While some test methods are quick, the most reliable test methods may take up to one year to see results. A description of the different tests conducted for aggregates susceptible to ACR is provided below. In addition to the tests mentioned below, this thesis

- 16-

partly focuses on the new RILEM microbar test for ACR which will be described in detail in Section 2.5.

2.2.2.1.

Petrographic Examination (ASTM C 295)

Essentially this is the first step in testing aggregate for ACR. Microscopic examination in a thin, polished section, possibly accompanied by other methods such X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, SEM, microprobe analysis, image analysis, and bilk chemical analysis, is used to identify the presence and distribution of potentially reactive material in aggregate (Fournier and Berube, 2000). In some cases, a petrographer with ACR experience could recommend accepting an aggregate based only on the knowledge of its petrographic characteristics; however. most of the time, additional testing on concrete is required to confirm preliminary indications from petrography. When a fractured surface affected by AAR is examined under a microscope, cracks are often seen within and adjacent to particles of expansive aggregate but rarely radiate from these particles (Gillott, 1975). When viewed microscopically, concrete affected by AAR also exhibit rims surrounding the reactive aggregate. The rims form due to a reaction between the aggregate and cement but do not necessarily indicate deleterious reactivity will occur (Gillott, 1975).

2.2.2.2.

Rock cylinder method (ASTM C 586)

If the petrographic examination indicates that the aggregate is potentially reactive, then samples of the aggregate can be tested using the rock cylinder method. This method is very effective in

- 17 -

determining the expansive capabilitics of carbonate rocks susceptible to AeR. The aggregate is first cut, cored, and shaped into a small cylinder approximately 9 mm in diameter and 35 mm in height. The ends of the cylinder are conical (like the tip of a pencil) to fit into a specially designed length comparator. The cylinders are stored in 50 to 100 mL storage bottles with alkali solution, usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The cylinder's length is periodically measured and results can usually be seen within 28 days. If the expansion is greater than 0.10% (ASTM, 1999) or if there is a significant change in volume, then the aggregate can be classified as potentially expansive (Famy and Kosmatka, 1997). Since every aggregate has different lithological

properties, the acceptance or rejection based on this test alone is not recommended by ASTM. The acceptance of an aggregate should be confimlcd by the results of the concrete prism expansion test.

2.2.2.3.

Concrete Prism Expansion Test (CSA A23.2-14A & ASTM C 1105)

Sometimes the petrographic examination of an aggregate indicates that an aggregate may be suitable for concrete, but the long tenn field perfonnance of the same concrete was poor. There have been cases where the rate of expansion are very slow but occur for a long period of time and cause deterioration of the concrete (Gillott, 1975). Test methods have been developed to detennine perfonnance based test results that would be indicative of field results. The main and most reliable test method is the concrete prism expansion test. The concrete prism test is applicable to both alkali-silica and alkali-carbonate reactive aggregates. Prisms are prepared using a specific quantity of cement, coarse-to-fine aggregates ratio, and water to cement ratio
(wlc) (i.e. 420 kg/m of portland cement, coarse-to-fine aggregate ratio of 60:40, and w/c ratio of
3

- 18-

0.42 to 0.45 except when supplementary cementing materials are used). When SCM is used. the CSA limits the w/c ratio to 0.35 to 0.40. One of the most important factors when conducting the concrete prism test is to establish a pre-defined alkali content. The portland cement used should have an alkali content of 0.9 Â± 0.1 % Na20e. CSA recommends raising the total concrete alkali content to 1.25% Na20e by mass of cement. To evaluate the expansiveness of coarse aggregate, a non-reactive fine aggregate must be used and vice versa. The concrete is prepared and cast into prisms (usually 75 x 75 x 275 mm). The prisms are kept in their moulds for 24 hours at 23 degrees centigrade CC), and then stored above water in a sealed plastic container lined with a damp material to maintain a humidity of over 95%. After the one day curing, the prisms are placed in a room controlled at 38Â°C. Length change measurements are made periodically up to 1 year with concrete containing cement and 2 years with concrete containing SCM. Aggregates can show different expansion rates in the Concrete Prism Test. Generally, the more rapid the onset of expansion and the development of micro-cracking due to ACR, the faster the leaching of alkalis out of the test prisms and the leveling off of the expansion cure (Fournier, and Berube, 2000). Expansions greater than 0.04% at one year are considered to be indicative of potentially reactive aggregates (Farny and Kosmatka, 1997).

2.2.2.4.

Chemical Composition Test (CSA A23.2-26A)

The chemical composition test also known as the chemical method for potential alkali-carbonate reactivity, is simply a chemical analysis done in the laboratory to determine if there are reactive forms of dolomite [CaMg(C03)2] in the aggregate. ACR susceptible aggregates fall within a certain range of CaO, MgO, and Ah03 contents (Fournier and Berube, 2000). A representative

- 19-

sample of the potentially reactive aggregate is reduced in size and passed through the 160-/lm sieve. The crushed aggregate sample is then homogenized and sent for chemical testing. The results from the test are plotted as shown on Figure 2-2. Carbonate aggregates that fall into the "considered potentially expansive" zone are considered susceptible to ACR. The only

shortcoming of this test method is that it does not identify aggregates that may be ASR expansIve. Even if an aggregate is not considered expansive for ACR, it should still be tested for ASR.

While there are many tests to determine whether or not an aggregate is susceptible to ACR, it is generally agreed upon that the concrete prism test results should always be given more importance than the other test methods.

- 20-

2.2.3.

How does ACR Occur?

In simplistic terms, ACR will occur when alkalis such as sodium or potassium hydroxides from cement paste enter the aggregate pores and react with dolomite crystals. The dolomite crystals are then broken down into other crystals by chemical reactions where magnesium (Mg2+) in the dolomite mineral structure is replaced with calcium (Ca2+) from the pore solution. This process of breaking down dolomite crystals into brucite and calcite minerals is known as "dedolomitization". Dedolomitization will usually result in volume changes in the concrete from the production of reaction products and disintegration of aggregates which in tum, will cause further deterioration in the concrete. However, the volume change that occurs is a reduction (i.e. the volume of solid products of the dedolomitization reaction is less than that of the dolomite which is replaced) (Swenson and Gillott, 1960). Studies using X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis (Gillott, 1963) showed that the rate of dedolomitization corresponded fairly closely to the rate of expansion of powdered rock and powdered mixtures which failed to expand. Gillott (1963) found that dedolomitization, but no expansion, occurred when alkali was introduced to the powdered rock. Therefore, dedolomitization could not account for the

difference between expansive and non-expansive materials. Gillott also found that the rate of dedolomitization was faster for fine-grained rock powders than coarser ones but the expansion due to ACR was greater on the coarse rock powders. While every aggregate has different

lithological characteristics that affect the expansion due to ACR, it was found that alkalicarbonate expansive concrete have a few common characteristics. Ozol (1994) found that ACR expansion is more likely to occur by: Â· Â· increasing coarse aggregate size moisture availability

- 21 -

Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·

higher temperature non air-entrained concrete high alkali content of concrete high pH of the liquid phase in cement pores high proportion of reactive stone in coarse aggregate lower concrete strength

2.2.4.

Mechanism of ACR - Dedolomitization

As mentioned above, the expansion mechanism behind ACR is dedolomitization.

The

dedolomitization process is the break down of dolomite by reacting with alkalis (high pH), to form calcite (lime) and hexagonal plates of brucite crystals (Swenson and Gillott, 1960). However, this is only the first phase of the dedolomitization process as shown in Equation 1 below:

Equation 1 - Dedolomitization:

CaMg(C03)z + 2 OH' (Dolomite) (Alkalis)

-+

CaC03 + Mg(OHh + (Calcite)

cot

(Brucite) (Excess Carbonates)

The alkali reactants in the reaction are usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) and generate the excess carbonate end products Na2C03 or K2C03, respectively. The excess carbonate products are important because they are used in the second phase of dedolomitization.

- 22-

In the second phase of dedolomitization, the excess carbonates react with calcium hydroxide
(portlandite) which is found in the concrete matrix. The product results in the reproduction of more alkali hydroxides, thus maintaining a high pH. The second phase of dedolomitization is known as the alkali regeneration phase and is shown in Equation 2 below:

Equation 2 - Regeneration of Alkalis

cot

+ Ca(OHh -. CaC0 3 + 20HCalcium Hydroxide Calcite More Alkalis

Excess Carbonates

The alkali products that form in Equation 2 fuel Equation 1 and will continue to react with the dolomite to form more mineral crystals and carbonates. The two reactions will keep driving each other until all the reactants are exhausted (Swenson and Gillott, 1964). (i.e. the reaction will continue to occur until all the dolomite or portlandite (calcium hydroxide from hydration) are used up).

During dedolomitization, dolomite and lime are replaced by brucite and calcite, minerals with a slightly greater volume than the reactants. As mentioned above, when AAR occurs, rims often form around the expansive aggregate. It is believed that considerable expansion occurs locally, at the rims and in the zones surrounding reactive aggregate particles, where calcite and brucite are deposited (Stokowski, 1997). This is the reason why we usually see a loss of bond between aggregate particles and the cement paste in ACR. Generally, small micro-fractures are

developed at the reactive rims and spread out into the aggregate and propagate into the paste. Dedolomitization may also cause depletion of chemicals producing voids in the dolomitic aggregate particles.

- 23-

2.2.5.

Expansion due to ACR

While the mechanism of ACR (Le. dedolomitization) has been agreed upon, the theory about what causes ACR expansion is still questionable. There are discrepancies among researchers as to what initiates the expansion, the dedolomitization itself or something else.

There are two main theories on how ACR expansion occurs in concrete.

The first theory

conducted by Swenson and Gillott concluded that the migration of alkali ions into the restricted space of the fine-grained matrix surrounding the dolomite rhomb caused an increase in porosity of the aggregates (Swenson and Gillott, 1969). Therefore, according to Swenson and Gillott, the role of dedolomitization is to open channels through which moisture and solutions enter the rock where surface hydration and sorption leads to moisture imbibition and the generation of swelling pressure. The moisture migration takes place in response to a gradient in the relative vapour pressure and is accompanied by a lowering in the partial free-energy of the water (Powers and Steinour, 1955). Swenson and Gillott further concluded that the uptake of water by dry clay minerals were a result of the dedolomitization reaction. Since ACR reactions only occur with argillaceous dolomitic limestone, the clay particles inside the aggregate would be more susceptible to water absorption after dedolomitization exposes them and would swell causing expansion. This theory argues that dedolomitization does not cause the expansion itself, but rather it exposes the clay particles in the aggregates making it easier the adsorption of alkali ions and water molecules on the surfaces of the "active" clay minerals scattered around the dolomite grains (Swenson and Gillott, 1969).

- 24-

The second theory of ACR expansion was first conducted by Tang who concluded that ACR expansion was in fact due to the dedolomitization mechanism itself (Tang et aI, 1987). Tang argued that the growth and rearrangement of mineral crystals in the first phase of dedolomitization causes the expansion.

In particular, they found that the crystallization of

brucite exerts pressure as it is formed which causes the expansion. Deng and Tang (1993), supported the idea that dedolomitization caused expansion directly. They proposed that

expansion was caused by the crystallization of brucite and calcite in voids. They stated that dedolomitization causes a reduction in volume in the beginning (about 5%). However, after the alkaline solutions penetrate into the interior of the reactive rock and dedolomitization takes place, the fine-grained reaction products of calcite and brucite form and fill voids in the rock as shown in Figure 2-3. By including the void volume that occurs between these products when formed, an increase in overall volume was found. Deng and Tang (1993) and Qian, et a1. (2001) proposed that clay minerals provide a pathway through which H20, K+, Na+, and OH' migrate into the interior of the reactive rock.

While there is evidence to support both theories, a third theory may be recognized by the combining the first two theories. Ozol (1994) suggested that both theories may be correct and that ACR expansion is a result of both brucite crystallization and clay mineral absorption. Unfortunately, there is no agreement as to how the expansion and deterioration is formed in ACR and more research is necessary.

2.2.6.

Recognizing Signs of ACR

Once deterioration due to ACR begins, it is importanr to disting uish when and where ACR is occurring so we can tend to the problem immediately. However, in some cases, ACR is difficult to identify and can easily be confused wi th other forms of deterioration. ACR expansion is us ually indicated by map or pattern cracking (Figu re 2-4) on the surface of a structural member. The cracks develop in response to a stress distribution which arises from di fferenc es in the amount of expansion in adj acent parts of the concrete element (G illott, 1975).

In general, areas which have moisture more read ily avai lable will suffer greater expansion. The
map or pattern cracking caused by ACR can be very easily confused with map cracking due to drying shrinkage, freezing and thawing, and sulphate attack. However, concrete elements

affected by ACR and ex posed to sun, moisture, and fros t ac tion us uall y show more extensive

- 26 -

cracking and deterioration (Fournier and Berube, 2000). Furthermore, surface cracking due to AAR rarely penetrates more than 25 to 50 mm of the exposed surface. The width of surface cracks exhibiting ACR can range from about 0.1 to 10 mm in extreme cases (Fournier and Berube, 2000). ACR can be more severe at joints, possibly from water accumulation and/or chloride ingress, and display joint closing or shoving. Figure 2Â·5b shows a pavement structure where the joint has expanded about 1.2% due to ACR expansion. The differential concrete swelling between

adjacent members as shown in Figure 2Â·5b can cause misalignment, separation, or distortion of adjacent structures. Furthermore, the expansion or swelling can cause excessive deflection, closure of joints and in severe cases spalling. This type of expansion or movement due to ACR has the same distress signals as excessive loading, thermal or moisture movements, differential shrinkage, foundation effects, hydraulic pressure, creep, impact and vibrations (BCA, 1992). ACR does not commonly have exudates or gel protruding from the cracks like ASR but may show extrusion of fillers or sealers as in Figure 2Â·6.

Concrete affected by ACR may also exhibit pop outs where part of the concrete has spalled from the original structure and leaves a conical depression. Pop outs are usually caused by fre ezing

- 30 -

and thawing of unsound aggregates. However, it should be noted that ACR can cause aggregates to deteriorate by microcracking and causing open channels for water to enter and freeze. While there are a few ways to distinguish between ACR and other distresses with similar signs of deterioration, the only actual way to determine if the structure is undergoing ACR expansion is through petrographic examination or through the other test methods mentioned above. In a petrographic examination, ACR can be recognized by:

Â· Â· Â· Â· Â·

Loss of bond between aggregate particles and cement paste Calcium-rich rims around dolomitic aggregate particles Fractures radiating from the interfacial zone of the aggregate Calcium-rich deposits in cracks Brucite in cracks, voids and paste, if argillaceous dolomitic limestone aggregate particles are also present.

Reactive aggregates such as dolomitic limestone exhibit visible alterations of the aggregate surface in contact with cement paste when viewed in the stereo microscope. These alterations around the aggregate-cement interface are known as reaction rims. Reaction rims must be carefully examined to distinguish them from natural alterations of the aggregate surface such as carbonation. In the petrographic study, reaction rims can be examined in detail and reaction product deposits or alterations to the cement paste can also be identified. Cody et al. (1994) observed reaction rims in reactive concrete in Iowa. The rim sequence they reported was

unaltered dolomite on the aggregate interior, a dark-colored dolomite reaction rim, a lightcolored dolomite reaction rim, a light-colored cement reaction rim in the paste, and dark

presumably unaltered cement paste. These rims are thought to have developed from the dedolomitization reaction, shown in Equation 1 (Cody in Sutter, 1995).

ASTM C 856 states the basic texture of most ACR aggregates as being relatively larger rhombic dolomite crystals in a fine-grained calcite matrix with clay and silt-sized quartz. Substantial amounts of both dolomite and calcite are present. In order to distinguish reactive from nonreactive aggregate, it is imperative that the aggregate mineralogy and other characteristics, such as porosity, texture, and grain size are known. Milanesi, et al. (1996), conducted a study using X-ray diffraction studies on rock cylinders and showed that dedolomitization occurs at different degrees of intensity, depending on the petrographic characteristics of the rock. Qian, et al. (200 I) said it was important to also determine the crystallinity of the individual dolomite crystals for ACR expansion because it may affect the dedolomitized rate of aggregate in alkali solutions. When viewed under a microscope, typical signs of ACR include cracks in the aggregates and rims surrounding reactive aggregate. These cracks may extend into the paste. They may be randomly oriented but may sometimes occur just under the surface of the aggregate as if a thin layer of the aggregate was about to pop off. Cross sections of elongated or flat particles affected by the reaction may show one or more lengthwise fine cracks nearly centered in the particle (Federal Highway Administration (FHW A), 1997). Figure 2-8 shows a typical snapshot of concrete affected by AAR when viewed under a microscope.

ACR in Concrete Structures

As mentioned previously, ACR expansion can lead to severe map or pattern cracking and thus cause deterioration of concrete structures. In 1969, the Ontario Department of Highways started reviewing the presence of alkali-aggregate reaction in their bridges in particular. The program started because they started to realize the extensive damage done by AAR to concrete bridges, dams, and pavements. They classified the cracks on their structures on a scale from 1 to 5, with

- 33 -

a rating of 1 for a network of cracks less than 0.5 mm and a rating of 5 given to concrete with a network of cracks usually wider than 3 mm.

The cracking of concrete structures is very important to its life cycle and its load carrying capacity. Cracking can cause many detrimental effects in concrete because it creates channels

for water movement and exposes the aggregates. This can lead to an increase in saturation of the concrete and increased porosity and permeability which reduces freeze-thaw durability. Cracks also make the concrete's microstructure structurally weaker and also diminish the aesthetics of the concrete. Map cracking caused by ACR also makes the aggregates more susceptible to erosion, accelerates chloride ingress from deicing salts, and can lead to corrosion of reinforcement, a problem that is very serious in many mass concrete structures.

2.2.8.

Preventative Measures

If we want to prevent ACR, we have to go back to the requirements needed in order for ACR to occur. If we eliminate the use of reactive aggregates, high alkalis from the cement and the availability of moisture then perhaps we can stop the effects of ACR. However, this is not an easy solution and some methods of control are not guaranteed to work. The most effective way to eliminate ACR is to eliminate the use of reactive dolomitic limestone (Le. use non-reactive aggregates). However, this can not always be done based on the local availability and cost of resources. Sometimes, it may be more economical to use what materials are high in demand then repair later rather than to transport and use expensive non-reactive aggregates. It was found that the coarse aggregate contributed more to ACR than the finegrained or sand particles (Milanesi et ai, 1996). Therefore, reducing the nominal maximum size

- 34-

of the aggregate may have some benefits.

A better solution would be combining/blending

reactive aggregates with non-reactive aggregates. By diluting the reactive aggregates the amount of reactivity should be less and there may be methods of preventing excessive expansion. This thesis focuses on diluting highly reactive dolomitic limestone by combining different percentages of reactive and non-reactive aggregates.

The second suggestion would be to use low-alkali cement. In theory, low-alkali cement would contribute fewer alkalis to the concrete pore solution and keep the pH relatively constant. In ASR, deleterious expansion and cracking of concrete could be significantly reduced and even prevented by using a low-alkali cement and limiting the threshold value of the total alkalis to 3.0 kg/m3 Na20e (Fournier and Berube, 2000). Table 2-1 shows the typical alkali content

contributed by different cement contents. The "safe alkali limit" is very different for ACR aggregates. Fournier and Berube (2000) suggested that the lowest recommended value of

1.8 kg/m 3 Na20e for structures with a relatively high risk level of AAR is expected to provide a sufficient safety factor to account for potential contribution of alkalis to the concrete pore solution by other sources than the cement. If the threshold value is not low enough, it is believed that the use of low-alkali cement only slows down the dedolomitization process but does not eliminate it all together. It was believed that using low alkali cement with a high volume of mineral admixture would help suppress the expansion due to ACR. Rogers and Hooton (1992) found that there were cracks due to ACR expansion in concrete containing low-alkali (0.56% NazOe) cement and when 20% silica fume, fly ash and slag were used. Their research showed than neither the use of supplementary cementing materials (SCM) nor low-alkali cement was effective in reducing ACR expansion. In general, when the alkali content of concrete is lower

- 35-

than 1.8 kglm 3, or the content of slag in cement is more than 50 percent, expansion due to ASR is effectively diminished (Tang et aI, 1994).

The interesting characteristic with ACR is that it can sustain itself. As shown in Equations 1 and 2 in Section 2.1.2.4, ACR regenerates the alkalis causing more dedolomitization. This is why some researchers believe that ACR will continue to occur even if there is low-alkali cement (low pH). Some researchers (Farny and Kosmatka 1997) believe that the more alkaline the pore solution is, the faster the reaction will occur. However, (Ozol 1994) found that at a pH lower than 12, the reaction proceeds slowly, if at all. Ozol also concluded that chemicals, such as deicers, increased the pH locally and increased ACR.

The moisture availability and humidity is usually hard to control because it is based on the climate in which the structure lies. Here in Canada, it is not likely that we can provide a dry environment with our heavy rain and snow, not to mention the high humidity we get in the

- 36-

summer. We can however, control the concrete's susceptibility to moisture. Concretes can be sprayed with sealers or waterproofers to minimize the moisture from penetrating towards the aggregates. Anything that will reduce the permeability of the concrete will have some beneficial effect on reducing AeR. SCM's are excellent at reducing the permeability of concrete and limiting moisture ingress. Section 2.3. SCM's will be discussed as a preventative measure by itself in

Another option to minimize moisture availability and humidity would be by

designing and building the concrete structure indoors.

Although there is no way to completely prevent ACR, there are a few design suggestions that may be used to minimize ACR. In terms of concrete mix design, a low water to cement ratio would be best so the permeability and porosity of the mix remain low making it less vulnerable to moisture attack. Petrographic examination and other tests of the aggregate should be done to see if it is reactive. The service record of the aggregate should also be reviewed to see if other concrete structures experienced any deleterious problems due to ACR

For reactive aggregate use, the following preventative measures in addition to others mentioned above can be taken to minimize ACR (Famy and Kosmatka 1997):

Â· Â· Â·

blend aggregate according to Appendix in ASTM C 1105 limit aggregate size to the smallest practical dilution of the potentially deleterious aggregate to less than 15% of the total aggregate or 20% of the coarse or fine aggregate.

- 37-

Deicing chemicals and cleaning compounds should be examined carefully to ensure that they are not an external source of alkalis and advance ACR.

2.2.9.

Repair of Structures Affected by ACR

The problem with ACR is that once it begins and because it is self-regenerating, it will continue to react until the reactants (dolomite and hydrated lime) are exhausted. Due to this mechanism structural damage caused by ACR can only be repaired by complete replacement of affected members. However, remedial actions may be taken to improve the appearance of the structure and in some cases provide support or reinforcement. MTO usually carries out routine repairs to the affected members not to fix the ACR problem itself, but to ensure structural integrity and control the rate of deterioration from other mechanisms such as corrosion of reinforcing steel (Rogers et ai, 2000). In concrete pavements, curb, gutter and sidewalks, Rogers et al (2000) found it useful to cut stress relief slots and replace the space with asphaltic concrete. The use of slot cutting helps relieve the stress build-up due to AAR and has been used on many AAR affected gravity dams. The only problem that may arise with slot cutting is that the expansion rates and movements often increase after the cutting and before the relief gap closes (Gocevski and Pietruszczak, 2000). Remedial actions can be taken to limit the moisture ingress as mentioned above. Ventilated cladding, silanes and siloxanes have shown beneficial effects in reducing deleterious expansion due AAR by allowing water vapor to permeate outside and the progressive drying of the concrete (Fournier and Berube, 2000). Flexible waterproof membranes can be used to limit moisture and to accommodate expansion when it occurs

- 38-

Some cracks due to ACR can be repaired by filling them with an epoxy resin injected under pressure. However, this type of treatment only prolongs deterioration for a few years after which time reflective cracking due to ACR is seen. Strengthening of an AAR affected structure can be done by chipping away of the badly cracked surface and applying an overlay on top. Strengthening can also be done by introducing

reinforcing by straps, steel plates, beams, composite materials, and post-tensioning (Fournier and Berube, 2000) Repair of ACR does not usually last for long, and signs of cracking can be seen again within about 3 to 10 years. Therefore, it is important that each region or municipality provide regular inspections to determine the degree of damage or distress due to ACR and for the safety of the public.

Case Study:

The Iowa Department of Transportation conducted a case study with durable and non-durable concrete pavements. The researchers (Cody et ai., 1994) concluded that dedolomitization

reactions were the primary cause for deterioration. Cody et al., reported altered aggregates exhibiting reaction rims, paste alterations of varying degrees with deposition of brucite and calcite rimming reactive dolomite aggregates (Sutter, 2005). What was revealed from their experiment was the difference in composition of their aggregates compared to what the aggregate composition should have been. Cody et at. reported a reactive dolomite structure with CaO/MgO ratios ranging from 1.483 to 1.775, which is higher than the standard 1.391 ratio for a 1: 1 stochiometric CaO/MgO ratio. Also, the rocks they analyzed were not predominately calcite crystals intergrown with dolomite grains. Even though the aggregate exhibited high porosity

- 39-

they didn't show a strong, interlocking crystal fabric that may accompany dedolomitization. The reactive dolomitic aggregates contained many small, euhedral to subhedral, dolomite crystals as compared to durable aggregates which were primarily coarse, tightly interlocked, dolomite crystals with few euhedral or subhedral outlines (Sutter, 2005). The durable aggregates also had a much lower porosity. Non-durable dolomite aggregates did not contain significantly higher clay concentrations as compared to durable dolomites which may cause the expansion based on first theory of how ARC expansion occurs mentioned above. A very important discovery made by Cody et al. (1994) was that ACR could be induced to some extent by using deicing solutions rich in calcium and magnesium. This means that cement would not be the only contributor of alkalis required for ACR to occur. Although this hypothesis is not confirmed by other

researchers, it is still important to keep in mind for future studies and perhaps to avoid the use of magnesium chloride and calcium chloride deicers on highways and roads.

Supplementary Cementing l\1ateriaJs
Nature of SCMs

SCMs were defined in Section 2.2.1.4 as mineral admixtures which react with Ca(OH)2 resulting from the hydration of portland cement to form hydration products such as C-S-H and C-A-S-H. SCMs are used as partial replacements of cement in concrete and can usually improve the fresh and mechanical properties of concrete. Each SCM or pozzolan is distinct and unique in terms of physical characteristics, chemical compositions and mechanisms involving concrete properties. The following section briefly discusses the various types of SCM used in this study.

- 40-

2.3.1.1.

Slag

Slags are non-metallic residues or by-products resulting from the production of metals from ore or refinement of impure metals. The slags used in concrete come from the blast furnace

production of iron from ore, hence the name blast furnace slag. Blast furnace slags are high in lime, silica and alumina (ACI 233R-95). When blast furnace slag cools in air, the molten slag crystallizes to form inert calcium magnesium silicates. The slag is then quenched with water and ground to cement fineness (approximately 15 Ilm) in order to become hydraulic and hence a useful mineral admixture (Mindess et al., 2003). However, if slag were to be mixed with water alone, it would take several months to reach the equivalent 28-day strength of a concrete made with portland cement.

The hydraulic reaction with slag is believed to be halted by the presence of impervious coatings of amorphous silica and alumina that form around the slag particles early in the hydration process. The slag needs to be activated by alkaline compounds such as soluble sodium salts (NaOH, Na2C03 or NaSi0 3) or calcium hydroxide. The slag produces a cementing compound similar to C-S-H but with a lower calcium to silica (CIS) ratio. 2.3.1.2. Silica Fume

Silica Fume (SF) is a by-product found in the manufacturing of silicon metal and alloys. The material is formed by vapor phase oxidation in the stack gases and collected in baghouses (Mindess, 2003). A good-quality silica fume will have up to 98% of amorphous silica (i.e. material that is formed by rapid cooling which inhibits crystallization). Silica fume is usually a very fine spherical material ranging in size from about 0.1 to 0.3 Ilm which is about 100 times

-41-

finer than portland cement CACI 243R-3). Furthermore, silica fume has a very large surface area which can cause problems with workability of concrete due to the high requirements for cement to coat the silica fume particles. Silica fume exhibits a high pozzolanic reactivity due to its high fineness and glass content. Condensed silica fume is essentially silicon dioxide in noncrystalline form. Silica fume is usually used at low replacement levels between 5% and 10% by mass of the total cementing materiaL Silica fume also provides excellent reduction in permeability due to its high fineness. 2.3.1.3. Metakaolin

Metakaolin is a special type of pozzolan made from calcined clay. It is formed by the calcination of high purity kaolinitic clay at a temperature between 650Â°C and 800Â°C (Sabir and Wild, 2001). The thermal activation of many clay minerals in air at these high temperatures leads to dehydroxylation which is the breakdown or partial breakdown of the crystal lattice structure forming a transition phase with high reactivity. The final product is an amorphous

aluminosilicate usually ground very finely to an average particle size of about 1 to 2!lm. Like other pozzolans and calcined clays, metakaolin reacts chemically with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) that results in the formation of additional calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). Results have shown that in terms of hydration, most of the metakaolin is hardly reacted after one day, but is fully reacted within 28 days in water activated paste (Khatib and Wild, 1996). On the other hand, when alkali-activated, the metakaolin is almost fully reacted at 28 days as well, but after one day, a quarter of the metakaolin was reacted (Love et aI, 2006). The high degree of

metakaolin resulted in long-chain highly aluminous C-S-H, with most of the bridging sites occupied by Ae+ rather than Si4 +.

- 42-

e.g. The production of metakaloinite (Ah03 . 2Si0 2) or AS 2 by calcining clay rich in kaolinite. When the AS2 reacts with CH from cement in the presence of water, cementitious aluminum containing C-S-H gel form together with crystalline products which include calcium aluminate hydrates and alumino-silicate hydrates. (Sabir and Wild, 2001).

Different sources of metakaolin will produce different results. For example, it was found that higher surface area metakaolin had enhanced dissolution of cementitious phases and provided additional, well-dispersed sites for nucleation of hydration products (Lagier and Kurtis, 2007). The use of metakaolin greatly improves mechanical and durability properties of concrete. Like silica fume, metakaolin increases the water demand at normal dosages and that water demand increases the higher the metakaolin replacement is (Badogiannis et aI, 2005). The slump is somewhat reduced, but its consistency is not as sticky as silica fume and provides a nicer finish. Due to these facts, it is not agreed upon whether or not metakaolin improves "workability" because even dry mixes were relatively easy to compact and produce good cohesion. However, at low waterlbinder ratios it is important that proper curing (water or steam curing) is employed and in most cases that a high range water reducer (HR WR or superplasticizer) is used to ensure a suitable workability.

Like other pozzolans, metakaolin concrete show reductions in temperature rise (i.e. lower heat of hydration) along with improved durability and increased strength. The increased strength in metakaolin concrete is due to a combination of the filler effect and accelerated cement hydration. The filler effect is a phenomenon we can relate to the interfacial transition zone (ITZ). Since metakaolin is a very fine material, the particles can fill most of the little voids between the

aggregate and the cement paste creating a very strong bond. The ITZ was found to be between 14% and 22% lower in metakaolin mixes (Asbridge et aI, 2002). If a low water to cement ratio is used with the addition of metakaolin, the strength of the concrete will be governed by the strength of the aggregate. (i.e. the aggregate will be the weakest link). It was found that

metakaolin enhances strength considerably in the early ages of curing and even after 365 days it can display higher strengths than silica fume mixes with the same replacement level (Caldarone etat, 1994).

Metakaolin has shown to produce concrete with improved sulfate resistance, suppression of ASR expansion and elimination of efflorescence in colored concrete (Pera, 2001). One of the reasons for the improved durability from metakaolin is due to the removal of calcium hydroxide by the pozzolanic reaction will reduce the alkalinity in the concrete. Therefore, there is less Ca(OH)2 in the pore solution which will suppress ASR and less Ca(OHh will also mean that sulphate attack from alkalis will be lowered if Na2S04 is in reaction and no more CaS04 will form. However, studies have shown that even though metakaolin removes Ca(OH)2 from the cement paste, replacement levels in excess of 15% are required to fully consume all the Ca(OHh produced. Oriol and Pera estimated that between 30% and 40% of metakaolin is required to remove all the Ca(OH)2 in portland cement mixes with a water binder ratio of 0.5. Metakaolin was found to reduce the long-term OH-, Na+ and K+ ion concentrations in the pore solution, therefore decreasing the pH and suppressing ASR (Ramlochan et aI., 2000).

Metakaolin changes the microstructure and diffusion properties of concrete in positive ways. Firstly, with the addition of meta kaolin the average pore size is reduced due to the metakaolin's

- 44-

fineness and the pore refinement produced by the pozzolanic reaction. Volumes of the capillary pore sizes were found to be between 0.05 to IOJlm. Secondly, since the pores are smaller and fewer there will be less interconnectivity between pores which decreases permeability. This is perhaps the main advantage of using metakaolin in concrete. The reduced permeability will provide better resistance to freezing and thawing, deicer-scaling, as well as sulphate attack and ASR as mentioned above. The reduction in permeability is why metakaolin concretes exhibit improved durability. However, research has also shown that when the replacement level of metakaolin is over 30%, there was an increase in porosity (Bredy et aI., 1989). Also related to pore size and permeability is the rate of diffusion. Metakaolin also significantly lowers the chloride ion diffusion coefficient of concrete and lowers the pore solution alkalinity without suppressing steel passivation. The chloride and alkali binding capacity is also improved in metakaolin concretes. capillary action. Metakaolin is greatly beneficial in reducing the water absorption by

Usually, an increase in the metakaolin content will create a reduction in

absorption by capillary action (Khatib and Clay, 2003). Even aggressive solutions such as sea water (which can cause sulphate attack) and toxic metals such as chromium or lead are greatly reduced due to the lower permeability, low water absorption, and the low diffusion rate of chloride ions of metakaolin concrete.

In terms of volume changes in concrete, at levels above 15% replacement, metakaolin will reduce both creep and shrinkage (Pera, 2001). More specifically, autogenous shrinkage was found to increase with an increase in metakaolin up to 10%. For more than 10% metakaolin by replacement, autogenous shrinkage decreased. This occurrence was due to the pozzolanic For chemical

reaction, in addition to cement hydration, removing water from the system.

- 45-

shrinkage, more than 15% metakaolin replacement level was found to significantly decrease chemical shrinkage. The total creep (basic creep and drying creep) were significantly reduced as the replacement level of metakaolin increased (Brooks and Johari, 2001).

In addition to the calcination of clay, another source of metakaolin may come from calcining waste sludge from the paper recycling industry. This would be beneficial and more economic because we can use metakaolin as a byproduct. Presently metakaolin is more expensive than Portland cement and silica fume, but the overall production cost is less than that of Portland cement. There are also not very many sources of metakaolin in North America which is another reason why its uses are limited. If we can use byproducts to form metakaolin at low production costs and sources are more readily available, metakaolin would definitely be a great advantage to the concrete industry.

2.3.1.4.

Fly Ash

Fly ash is the most commonly used SCM in the world. It is a fine powder like material that results from the combustion of pulverized coal in electric power generating plants. During combustion of coal, the coal's mineral impurities (such as clay, feldspar, quartz and shale) are carried away from the combustion chamber by exhausting gases. The material that is carried away is fused together and when cooled, it solidifies into spherical glassy particles called fly ash (Famy and Kosmatka, 1997). The size of fly ash ranges from about 1 /lm to more than 100/lm.

Fly ashes are divided into two main classes, F and C, which reflect the composition of the inorganic fractions. Class F fly ashes are produced from bituminous and subbituminous coals

- 46-

while Class C fly ashes are derived from the lignitic coals of west em states (Mindess et ai, 2003). Class C fly ashes contain high levels of calcium oxide, much of which is in the glassy fraction. Fly ashes often contain alkali oxides often in the form of soluble salts that improve the efficiency of the electrostatic precipitators and may occasionally influence the rate of setting (Mindess et ai, 2003). CSA A23.5 further classifies the different types of fly ash based on the calcium content as shown in Table 2-2 below.

Table 2-2 CSA classification offly ash based on Calcium content Type Low Calcium (F) Intermediate Calcium (CI) High Calcium (CH) CaO (%) < 8Â±1 > 8 and<20Â±2 >20

Fly ash is primarily silicate glass containing silica, alumina, iron and calcium. However, crystalline compounds can be present in small amounts. The amorphous phase of fly ash varies in composition from one fly ash to another and is different than the amorphous phases of silica fume or slag.

2.3.2.

SCMs as a Preventative Measure

A lot of studies have paid close attention to using SCM as a preventative measure to control the expansion due to AAR. Most studies have focused on ASR but few have considered the effects of SCM on ACR. In general, there have been many studies that have shown SCM or a

combination of SCMs can significantly reduce and control deleterious expansion due to ASR in concrete (Fournier and Berube, 2000). This thesis focuses on determining the effects of SCM on ACR and provides further evidence for past literature in this field of study.

- 47-

As mentioned in Section 2.1.2.1.4, the main benefits of pozzolans include reducing the amount of Ca(OH)z , lowering the OH concentration and reducing the permeability of the concrete. Typical pozzolanic capacity of each type of SCM or in other words, the SCM's ability to consume Ca(OH)z is shown in Table 2-3. While the use of SCMs have been effective in

controlling expansion due to ASR, the use of SCMs, even in large amounts, were found to be not effective in counteracting expansion due to ACR (Williams and Rogers, 1991; Berube and Fournier, 2000).

Table 2-3 Typical Pozzolanic Capacity of Selected Pozzolans (Mindess et at, 2003)
Pozzolan Blast Furnace Slag Silica Fume Fly Ash - Class C Class F Metakaolin mg Ca(OH)2 consumed per g 40 400 500 850 1000

Both fly ash and slag have been very effective in controlling the expansion due to ASR. 30 to 35% low- to moderate-calcium and low-alkali fly ash, 50% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), or 10 to 12% silica fume, as replacement by mass of portland cement in concrete are necessary to provide adequate protection against ASR (Berube and Fournier, 2000). A larger proportion of high-calcium fly ash is generally required to achieve similar reduction levels of expansion than low calcium ashes, especially when highly reactive aggregates are used (Thomas, 1996).

- 48-

2.3.2.1.

Fly Ash

One of the mechanism by which the ash controls alkali-silica reaction is by increasing the alkali binding capacity of the hydrates and thus reducing the alkalinity of the pore solution. (Thomas et aI., 1999). According to Thomas et al. (1999), the increased binding capacity of cement fly ash hydrates has been linked to the lower Ca/Si ratio of the hydrates compared to Portland cement pastes without fly ash. However, Shehata and Thomas (2000) showed that fly ash's ablility to reduce the pore solution alkalinity was not the only factor in reducing expansion due to ASR. The efficacy of fly ash in reducing pore solution alkalinity was found to be related to the oxide compositions of the ash. The higher the CaO and Na20e, and the lower the Si02, the lower the efficiency of the fly ash in reducing pore solution alkalinity (Shehata and Thomas, 2000) Furthermore, they found that low-calcium fly ashes (Type F) were more effective in controlling expansion due to ASR compared to high-calcium ashes (Type CH) at the same replacement level.

2.3.2.2.

Slag

Slag is effective in limiting expansion from ASR, but there is not a consensus on what the minimum amount required should be. This minimum level is a function of the aggregate and the alkali level in the concrete. The CSA recommends a minimum of 50 percent replacement, which is difficult to achieve in practice because of low early strength concerns and resistance to deicing salts (Thomas and Innis, 1998). Past experience with ACR has shown that even with high replacement levels (50%), slag is not effective in controlling the expansion due to ACR (Williams and Rogers, 1991).

- 49-

2.3.2.3.

Silica Fume

As mentioned previously, the main benefit of silica fume is its ability to refine the pore structure of concrete due to its high finesses. Thus, silica fume helps minimize the deleterious expansion due to AAR by reducing the permeability. However, Shehata and Thomas (2000) showed that the use of silica fume also resulted in a decrease in expansion due to ASR due to silica fume's ability to decrease the pore solution alkalinity.

2.3.2.4.

Ternary Blends

Ternary blends are concrete mixes containing portland cement and two types of SCM (i.e. three types of cementing compounds). Past literature with ternary blends has shown that a synergistic effect is observed between the different types of SCM so that a lower replacement level of SCM can be used combined compared with the amount of the individual SCM material (Bleszynski et al. 2000; Shehata and Thomas, 2000). It is not known how ternary blends have performed with ACR affected concrete. However, this thesis will provide results on the effects of ternary blends with 1. Portland cement, silica fume and fly ash; 2. Portland cement silica fume and slag; and 3. Portland cement fly ash and slag. The concrete prism expansion results of these mixes will be presented in Chapter 4.

2.4.

Effect of SCl\1 on Pore Solution Alkalinity

The main focus of this thesis was to determine whether alkalis from SCMs contributed more to expansion due to ACR or to if a beneficial effect would take place if SCM is used. As

- 50-

mentioned, SCMs contain their own alkali contents. The question postulated is how much alkalis, if any, are contributed by SCM? Sometimes alkalis from SCMs exceed the alkali content found in portland cement. To further study this we have to have an understanding of the alkali release characteristics of concrete with SCM. Most of the research in this field has been focused mainly on silica fume and fly ash, with none prominently focused on slag.

In general, the release of alkalis from portland cement is relatively quick while the release of
alkalis from SCM will be released over a longer period of time. The release of the alkalis from SCM is dependent on the reactivity of the SCM and overtime the amorphous phases are released. Studies (Thomas and Shehata, 2004) have shown that the OH is directly related to the CaO and NazOe content, but is inversely related to the Si02 content. The NazOe represents the total amount of alkali available to the system whereas the SiOz represents the binding ability of the hydrates (Shehata and Thomas, 2006). The ability to bind alkalis is commonly a way of stating that phenomenon that occurs when the hydration products that form from SCM entrap alkalis in these hydration products. If the alkali concentration of the pore solution drops, then alkalis from the hydrates will be released to compensate for the drop and to maintain equilibrium. Bhatty (1985) argued that the amount of alkali released is a function of the hydrate composition (Ca/Si) and alkali concentration of the solution.

When a reactive aggregate is introduced into the system, it reacts with alkalis in the pore solution and depletes the amount of alkalis in the system. As a result, the cement or SCM hydrates will release alkalis to maintain equilibrium. Gillott and Rogers (1994) concluded that the increase in expansion is attributed primarily to the release ofNaOH caused by reaction between reactive

phases in the aggregate and Ca(OHh. While there is much work that shows that a certain pH is required to sustain ASR, the same cannot be said about ACR. Since the dedolomitization mechanism can lead to the regeneration of alkalis, there is no clear consensus on what the minimum pH or alkali ion concentration should be. Furthermore, each aggregate susceptible to ACR is expected to have a different minimum alkali ion concentration to be deemed expansive.

Shehata and Thomas (2006) found that the total alkalis contributed from fly ash with a CaO > 20% were larger than those contributed by CaO < 20%. This may be why Type CH fly ash is not as effective in mitigating expansion due to ASR compared with Type F or Cl fly ash. Furthermore, the total alkalis available were much greater in the Type CH fly ash and are expected to contribute much more alkalis to maintain equilibrium when reactive aggregates are introduced in the system

Ternary bends showed superior performance in terms of binding and retaining alkalis. However, silica fume on its own did not show a high capacity to bind or retain alkalis in its hydration products when used at replacement levels of 5% or 10% (Shehata and Thomas, 2006). It is believed that silica fume initially retains alkalis but overtime releases them into the pore solution (Shehata, 2001). The ternary blends performed better due to the initial binding of alkalis by silica fume and the ability of fly ash to bind and retain alkalis at later ages (Shehata, 200 1).

l\tlicrobar Accelerated Test for ACR (RILEl\tl Test Method AAR-OS)

As mentioned in Section 2.1.2, the concrete prism test is the most reliable test to determine the effects of ACR on concrete. However, it takes up to 1*year to see reputable results (2*years when SCM is used). For years researchers have been trying to develop a rapid and reliable test

- 52-

method for the determination or screening of an alkali-carbonate reactive aggregate, similar to the Accelerated Mortar Bar Test (AMBT) for testing ASR.

In the early 2000's, an accelerated concrete microbar method was developed in China (Xu et al., 2000). The microbar allowed results to be seen within 28-days compared to I-year with the concrete prism test. The concrete microbar test was very similar to the AMBT except only coarse single-sized aggregates (5 - 10 mm) were used. The cross-section of the microbars was increased to 40 mm by 40 mm with a length of 160 mm, due to the increase in aggregate size compared with the AMBT. Since no fine aggregates were used in the mix, a low w/c ratio of 0.30 had to be used to avoid segregation (Lu et al., 2006). The microbar was tested in Austria where ACR expansive concrete which reacted in the field but passed the AMBT, gave significantly higher expansion in the microbar test (Lu et ai, 2006). In 2003, RILEM then

developed an AAR-05 method and organized a multi-laboratory trial to optimize the microbar test procedure. To improve the workability of the mix, the aggregate size was changed in the RILEM method from 5 - 10 mm to 4 - 8 mm. In a separate study, Lu et al. (2006) found a better correlation with the concrete prism test using an aggregate size ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 mm. Part of this thesis was to evaluate microbar method as multi-laboratory test with the use of ACR aggregate from the Pittsburgh quarry in Kingston, Ontario. The results from many of these multi-laboratory tests depend on their ability to correlate well with the results of the concrete prism expansion test. Other studies (Lu et ai, 2006)were carried out testing Pittsburgh aggregate, as well as other types of aggregates affected by AAR in Canada and China. The effects of cement alkalinity, SCM, w/c ratio, bar size and particle size were all key factors that were manipulated to produce the most reliable results to correlate with the concrete prism test.

- 53 -

One of the important changes to the test method was the increase in bar size from 160 mm to 285 mm. The change in bar size had no significant effect on the expansion of the test specimens, but the change to 285 mm allowed the North American type length comparator measuring devices to be used. Furthermore, the length of the specimens could now be constant with the length of the concrete prisms and the mortar bars from the AMBT. The w/c ratio was also changed from the original value of 0.30 to 0.33. An interesting discovery was found which showed that the for both low-alkali and high-alkali cement, the addition of alkalis (from both NaOH and KOH) to the cement paste led to reduced ultimate expansion after 28-days compared with the control without added alkali (Lu et aI, 2006). It was suggested that the results derive from the microbars' first 24 hours in water which only the alkalis from cement induce the ACR reaction. For this reason, it was concluded that high-alkali cement be used directly in the

standard test procedure in order to get high ultimate expansion.

Fly ash was used in the microbar test to distinguish between aggregates susceptible to ASR versus ACR. The theory behind this came from past experience showing that fly ash was more likely to reduce expansion due to ASR and have no effect on expansion due to ACR.
Andi~-<;akir

et al. (2009) also tested the use of SCMs in the concrete microbar test and

concluded that a good correlation existed between the 30-day concrete microbar test and the 14-day AMBT. However, they did not correlate these results with the concrete prism test. It was ultimately decided by Lu et al. (2006) that there as no obvious correlation between the expansion in the concrete prism test and the concrete microbar test. However, an expansion criteria of 0.1 % at 28-days was determined as being the highest possible expansion for aggregates to be

- 54-

considered "safe". Moreover, it was suggested that if an aggregate fails the concrete microbar test, it should not be rejected until the performance is confirmed by the concrete prism test. The full experimental test procedure carried out in this thesis is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

2.6.

Permeability of Concrete

The permeability of concrete has a large influence on the long term durability of the concrete. Permeability is defined as the rate of flow of a fluid under pressure in a porous material. This transport property is highly affected by the porosity and the pore structure. The pore structure can be defined through pore size. distribution, shape, and connectivity. The porosity of a

material is defined as the ratio of the volume of all the pores in a material to the whole volume. Hence the pore structure affects the permeability, and the pore size affects the permeability in a way that the larger the pores, the easier the water or fluid to flow through. The distribution of the pores plays a big role in the flow of fluids within the concrete. The connectivity can help the flow of liquid through the concrete. If the pores are connected, fluids are allowed to move in many paths of flow, but if they are disconnected the fluid is trapped and cannot move on. A low permeability concrete generally possesses high strength and is resistant to the ingress of water and salt solutions. In general, as the w/c ratio decreases, the porosity of the past decrease and thus the concrete becomes more impermeable. The permeability of concrete is primarily

dominated by the large capillary pores rather than gel pores (Mindess et aI, 2003). The first defense against permeability is to reduce the water to cement (w/c) ratio this will slow down the penetration of chloride salts by decreasing capillary pores. The w/c ratio should be less than 0.4 to minimize chloride penetration. Increasing the cement content and reducing the water content by using water reducers and superplasticizers will create a denser concrete, which ultimately decreases permeability The permeability of concrete is important to our studies with AAR

- 55-

because it controls the rate of entry of moisture and any substance that may contain aggressive or deleterious chemicals. While the concrete permeability is related to the concrete's susceptibility to ACR, it is unsure whether SCMs provide beneficial effects due to the material itself or whether the decrease in permeability is the primary factor for any beneficial results. The use of SCMs and pozzolans has been shown to reduce the permeability of concrete by refining the concrete pore structure. These SCM generally have a lubricating effect which reduces water demand (except for silica fume). This water reduction reduces internal voids and bleed channels and keeps harmful compounds out of the concrete.

2.6.1.

Effect of SCM on permeability

Supplementary cementing materials have a very significant effect on the pore solution chemistry of concrete, depending on the amount and composition of the material. SCM with low alkali content will draw more alkalis into the hydration products than they release to the pore solution, which will lower the pH value and assist in the defense against alkali-aggregate expansion of concrete. (Duchesene, 1994) As mentioned already" the use of SCM will reduce the permeability of concrete due to the pore refinement. Silica fume and metakaolin also reduce the permeability of concrete by acting as microfillers to greatly reduce voids.

2.6.1.1.

Slag

As portland cement hydrates, it forms C-S-H gel and Ca(OHh. C-S-H is the "glue" that provides strength and bonds the concrete together. Permeability is related to the proportion of C-S-H to Ca(OH)2 in the cement paste. The higher the proportion of C-S-H to Ca(OH)2. the lower the

- 56-

permeability of the concrete. When s lag is used as a cementitio us material in a concrete mixture, it reacts with Ca(Ollh to form add itional C -S- H, wh ich in turn lowers the perm eability of the concrete (Fernandez and Malholtra, (990). Typical res ul ts show the hi gher the perc en tage of slag in a concrete mi xture, the lower the penneability o f the concrete. Concre te contai ni ng 25 to 65 % slag w ill generally lower the permeability.

Conventional concretes made with only Portland cement may have coulomb "alues of 6 to 15 times higher that the same mi xture with silica fume or slag cement. The majority of this difference is due to the inherent o f these modified concretes. Conventional concrete may have 5 to 10 fold decrease in cou lombs passed when 7% silica fume is added to the m ix . While the actual chloride ingress after 90-day ponding tests may decrease only one or two times.

- 57 -

2.6.1.2.

Fly Ash

Recent testing has shown that properly proportioned concretes using a combination of fly ash, normal or high-range water reducing admixtures, and air entraining admixtures have the ability to produce the same low levels of permeability as latex modified and silica-fume concretes. Fly ash increases the cementitious compounds, minimizes water demand, and reduces bleed channels - all of which increase concrete density. These factors yield concrete of low permeability with low internal voids. Durability is increased with regard to freeze-thaw damage and disintegration from attack by acids, salts or sulfates. Through pozzolanic activity, fly ash chemically combines with water and calcium hydroxide - forming additional cementitious compounds which result in denser, higher strength concrete. Concrete density is also increased by the small, finely divided particles of fly ash which act like micro-aggregates to help fill in the tiniest voids in the concrete.

2.6.2.

Rapid Chloride Permeability Test

One of the most common permeability tests used in concrete research is the Rapid Chloride Permeability Test (RCPT). The RCPT is used as test method in this thesis in determining the permeability of different concrete mixes with SCM. The RCPT was first developed by Whiting in 1981 (Whiting, 1981). The RCPT (ASTM C1202 or AASHTO T277) has been criticized by many scientists and researchers all over the world during the past decade because of its lack of scientific bases and harsh testing conditions. Some confusion lies in the fact that ASTM C1202 recognizes that a correlation between that rapid chloride permeability test and the 90-day ponding test results is necessary, while AASHTO T277 does not require this correlation. Whiting found that the coefficient of correlation (r2) was 0.92, but the estimated quantitative

- 58-

error was 30 % (Whiting, 1981). This correlation is widely scrutinized by the industry especially in concrete mixes with silica fume, fly ash and high-range water reducing admixtures (Shane, 1999). The RCPT is performed by monitoring the amount of electrical current that passes through a sample 50 mm thick by 100 mm in diameter in 6 hours (Figure 2-10. RCPT). This sample is usually cut as a slice of a core or cylinder. A voltage of 60V DC is maintained across the ends of the sample throughout the test. One lead is immersed in a 3.0% salt (NaCI) solution and the other in a 0.3 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.

Based on the charge that passes through the sample, a qualitative rating is made of the concrete's permeability. (Table 1. rating of chloride permeability) Versatile and easy to conduct, the RCPT has been adopted as a standard and is now widely used (Stanish, 1997). Several discussions have been published regarding the validity of the test method (Hooton, 2000).

The current that passes through the sample during the test indicates the movement of all ions in the pore solution (that is, the sample's electrical conductivity), not just chloride ions. Furthennore, supplementary cementing materials (such as silica fume, fly ash and GGBFS) or chemical admixtures (such as water reducers, superplasticizers, or corrosion inhibitors) can create misleading results largely due to the chemical composition of he pore solution, rather than the penneability. As a result, some researchers do not recommend the RCPT to evaluate the chloride penneability of concrete containing these materials. (Shi, 1998) The conditions under which the measurements are taken may cause physical and chemical changes in the sample, resulting in unrealistic values because the steady-state migration has yet to be achieved. (Stanish, 1997) The high voltage applied during the test increases the temperature of the This

concrete sample, which can accelerate hydration, particularly in younger concretes.

increase in temperature is also apparent in lower quality concretes, which further increases the charge passed. The heat energy produced will further damage the low quality concrete as increase in charge passed continues. These criticisms of this technique not only create a loss of confidence in measuring chloride ion penetrability, they contribute to a loss of precision. The RCPT has difficulties creating consistent and repeatable results. The precision statement in

- 60-

ASTM C1202-97 indicates that a single operator will have a coefficient of variation of 12.3%; will means that two properly conducted test on the same material by the same person should differ by no more than 35%. (Stanish, 1997) The multi-laboratory coefficient of variation has been found to by 18.0%. Due to this variation, three samples are usually conducted and the test results averaged, which brings the multi-laboratory average down to 29%. The test method procedure and the samples tested using the RCPT in this thesis will be discussed in Chapter 3.

Summary

Alkali-carbonate reactivity has been known about since the 1950's but there still is a lack of knowledge when it comes to the deterioration of concrete. While researchers agree that ACR causes expansion which can lead to deterioration of the concrete, there is no agreement as to what causes the expansion. Some researchers argue that it is the clay particles in the dolomitic aggregate while others say it is the crystallization of brucite that causes expansion. The fact that ACR can self-regulate itself by regenerating alkalis makes it more difficult to control and prevent. There are many tests that can show if ACR exists in concrete. However, new more efficient test models are being developed to determine the reactivity of dolomitic limestone. Unfortunately, there is no cure for ACR but by using certain methods and procedures, we can help minimize the deleterious effects on concrete done by ACR. Continuing research is needed to provide answers as to how the expansion mechanism in ACR works, and to investigate solid preventative measures to halt the advancement of ACR expansion. This thesis attempts to find

- 61 -

ways of reducing the expansion due to ACR through the use of SCM. The materials and the experimental test procedures used in this thesis will now be discussed in Chapter 3.

- 62-

CHAPTER 3 Materials and Experimental Details
The primary objective of the experimental program was to investigate the expansion of concrete containing alkali carbonate reactive aggregate and determine how the contribution of alkalis from supplementary cementing materials (SCM) affects the expansion of the concrete. While many studies have focused on effects of SCM on ASR, limited attention has been paid to the use of SCM in concrete containing aggregates that are susceptible to ACR. Previous studies (Rogers et al., 2000) have used typical binary blends of Portland cement with fly ash, silica fume, or ground granulated blast furnace slag to address the potential for ACR expansion. This thesis will expand on the results of those previous studies, with the intention of developing a database that can be used for future references. In addition, the effects of SCM on marginally reactive ACR are also examined. The thesis also looks at the mechanisms by which different SCM affects the expansion. Additionally, the efficacy of the newly developed accelerated microbar test (RILEM AAR-05) in predicting the expansion of concrete with carbonate reactive aggregate is investigated.

3.1

Materials

The following section describes the materials used in the production of concrete for the different experimental test methods performed.

3.1.1

Aggregates One

Two different types of aggregates were used throughout the experimental program. aggregate was highly-carbonate reactive, while the other one was classified as non-reactive.

- 63-

The reactive aggregate was taken from the Pittsburgh quarry in Kingston, Ontario, Canada and is referred to as Pittsburgh aggregate. The Pittsburgh aggregate provided by the MTO was a crushed argillaceous dolomitic limestone which has a typical prophyrotopic-M texture (Qian et ai, 2002). Pittsburgh aggregate for concrete was sampled from the 0 to 24-foot horizon and was comprised of 5 to 15 percent clay-silica fraction and about 35 to 40 percent dolomite, with the remainder being calcite (Swenson, 1959). As mentioned in the literature, aggregates with a calcite to dolomite ratio of 1: 1 often experience high reactivity and expansion. The Bulk

Relative Density (BRD) of the Pittsburgh aggregate was 2.661 and the absorption was 0.69%.

The 19.0 mm crushed non-reactive limestone aggregate was from Dufferin Construction's Milton quarry and was taken from the Niagara Escarpment Dolomite Annabelle Lockport formation. The Bulk Relative Density (BRD) of the non-reactive coarse aggregate was 2.696 and the absorption was 1.15%.

3.1.2

Sand

The only type of sand used throughout the course of tile experimental program was concrete sand from St. Mary's Cement Sunderland pit. The sand was non-reactive and originated from the Oak ridges Moraine Deposit in Southern Ontario. The BRD of this non-reactive sand was 2.655 and the absorption was 0.65%.

- 64-

3.1.3

Cement

High-alkali and low-alkali Type 10 General Use Portland cement were used in this project. Different shipments of the same type of cement were used throughout this experimental program. The main concern in having different shipments of cement was that the alkali content (i.e. the equivalent sodium oxide) would be different for each batch and this could affect the results of the expansion. The first batch of cement used had an alkali content of 0.98 NazOe which was used in the concrete prism testing as a control batch and then the alkalinity was raised to 1.25 NazOe using sodium hydroxide solution as per CSA A23.2 - 14A-2004. The second and third batches of cement had alkali contents of 1.08 and 0.97 NazOe, respectively. The final batch of cement had an alkali content of 1.02 NazOe and was used for additional concrete prim testing and for all microbar mixes. Two (2) other low-alkali cements with alkali contents of 0.6 and 0.8 NazOe were also used for control mixes during the concrete prism experimental program to determine the affect of added alkalinity from the cement paste.

3.1.4

Supplementary Cementing Materials (SCM)

The SCM investigated in this study included five (5) different types of fly ashes having different chemical compositions, one (1) slag with a low alkali content, one (I) silica fume of high silica and low alkali content, and one (I) type of high reactive metakaolin with a low alkali content. The chemical composition of the cementing materials, their specific gravity, and their percent fineness (passing the 45-micron sieve) are listed in Table 3-1. All of the materials used are representative of cementing materials found in North America. The fly ashes have a variety of chemical compositions denoted herein by its Calcium Oxide (CaO) content and its alkalinity (or equivalent sodium oxide content NazOe). The CaO content for the fly ashes used ranged from

- 65-

7.24 to 34.16 percent and the NazDe contents ranged from 1.5 to 8.7 percent. According to CSA A23.5 "Supplementary Cementing Materials", the fly ashes are classified as being Type F

Â«

8%

Â± 1% CaD), Type CI (> 8% and:::; 20% Â± 1% CaD), or Type CH (> 20% CaO). For this study, the alkali content was classified as being low-alkali LA (NazOe:::; 2.0), moderate-alkali MA (> 2.0 and:::; 3.5 NazOe), or high-alkali HA (> 3.5 NazOe). For example, a low-calcium, low-alkali fly ash composition would be labeled Type F-LA fly ash. For ternary blends, the amount of silica fume (which was usually a replacement level of 5 percent) was listed first, followed by the second type of SCM. For example, a mix design containing 5% silica fume and 20% lowcalcium high-alkali fly ash would be labelled as 5/20% SF/F-HA. The same SCM's were used throughout the entire duration of the experimental study for use in concrete prism tests, concrete microbar tests, as well as in Rapid Chloride Permeability Testing (RCPT).

3.1.5

Superplasticizer

Superplasticizer (SP) is a common name for a high-range water reducing admixture. In mixes containing silica fume and metakaolin, a small amount of SP was added to increase the workability of the mix. The SP used was a non-chloride containing admixture manufactured by Euclid Admixture Canada Inc. The type of SP was a naphthalene sulfonate based admixture with a specific gravity of 1.210 and a total solids content of 40.5% (Ontario DSM, 2008). The solids content consisted of calcium lignosulfonate and sodium lignosulfonate.

Mix Designs

Over sixty different concrete prism mixes were used to evaluate the expansion of Pittsburgh aggregate from Kingston, Ontario due to ACR. combinations of SCM were used in this study. Mixtures with different alkali levels and As mentioned in the literature, Pittsburgh

aggregate is a highly reactive dolomitic limestone that causes severe expansion in concrete. It was determined from preliminary mixes during this study that when Pittsburgh aggregate was diluted to only 10 percent of the aggregate proportion of a mix design, the expansion would be similar to that of a marginally reactive aggregate. Once the dilution percentage was determined, several mix designs were carried out to examine the affect of alkalis on what would then be considered a marginally reactive concrete mix.

3.2.1

Control Mixes

Five (5) different control mixes were carried out with different alkali dilution levels. The mixes had Portland cement with equivalent sodium oxide values of 0.6, 0.8, 0.98 and 1.25 percent. Five (5) additional control mixes were carried out using aggregate dilution. Instead of using 100 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate in the mix designs, trial batches were carried out with replacement levels of 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate. As mentioned above, the main purpose of the aggregate dilution was to determine which dilution percentage would produce a marginally reactive aggregate (with expansion of around 0.04% at 1 year).
3.2.2

Fly Ash Mixes

Fifteen (15) fly ash mixtures containing different replacement levels of fly ashes with different chemical compositions were used in the concrete prism testing. Four (4) mixes contained a

68

moderate-calcium, low-alkali content; three (3) mixes contained with a high-calcium, low alkali content; three (3) mixes contained a low-calcium, high-alkali content, three mixes (3) contained a high-calcium, moderate-alkali content, and two (2) mixes contained a high-calcium, high alkali content. Twelve (12) of the fifteen (15) fly ash mixes mentioned above were then tested using an aggregate dilution of 10 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate

3.2.3

Slag Mixes

Two (2) different mix designs were carried out using ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS). A replacement level of 30 percent GGBFS was used for two different alkali levels. Similar to the fly ash mixes, two GGBFS mixes were also completed using 10 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate with GGBFS replacement levels of 30 and 40 percent.

3.2.4

Silica Fume Mixes

Two (2) silica fume mix designs were completed based on typical economical and construction mix designs. Concrete mixes with silica fume replacement levels of 5 and 10 percent were made. Based on the initial readings for the silica fume mixes carried out in this study, only one mix design was carried out using the aggregate dilution of 10 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate and 5 percent silica fume.

3.2.5

Metakaolin Mixes

Two (2) metakaolin mixes were carried out for both the concrete prism test and the concrete microbar test. Similar to silica fume, metakaolin is very fine, and high replacement levels are

- 69-

uneconomical and concrete can become too hard to work with in its fresh state. Therefore, replacement levels of 10 and 15 percent metakaolin were used. Both of these replacement levels were also used for an additional two (2) mix designs using an aggregate dilution of 10 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate.

3.2.6

Ternary Blends

Ternary blends are concrete mix designs that incorporate ordinary Portland cement with two (2) different types of SCM. In this study, ternary blends were primarily carried out with ordinary Portland cement, 5 percent silica fume and one (1) other SCM. In one case, a ternary blend was carried out with 20 percent high-calcium, low alkali fly ash and 30 percent slag. Seven ternary blends were made using fly ashes, two with stag, and four ternary blends were diluted with 10 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate. A summary of the concrete mixtures used in this thesis are presented in Tables 3-2 and 3-3.

3.3

Experimental Program & Details

As in the introduction to Chapter 3, the main purpose of the experimental program was to determine what affect different SCM's had on concrete expansion due to ACR. To evaluate this, an experimental program consisting of the following three (3) test methods was considered: Â· Â· Â· Concrete Prism Test (CPT) Concrete Microbar Test for ACR Rapid Chloride Permeability Test (RCPT)

Concrete Prism Test

The main portion of the experimental program was based on the results obtained from the concrete prism test to evaluate the reactivity of different SCM on ACR. More than 60 concrete prisms were cast and tested according to CSA A23.2 - 14A "Standard Concrete Prism Test". As outlined in the standard, 420 kglm 3 of cementitious material was used in all mix designs with a
W/CM ranging from 0.42 to 0.45. The designed coarse aggregate to sand ratio was 60:40. As

mentioned on Table 3Â·2, the alkali content of the mixes varied from 0.6 to 1.25 % Na20e to evaluate the effect of alkali dilution on ACR. Only a few SCM mixes had alkali contents of 0.80 % Na20e while all the other mixes with SCM had alkali contents of 1.25 % Na20e. This was achieved by adding NaOH to the mixing water as per CSA A23.3-14A; however, the alkali content of the SCM was not included in the calculation for Na20e. Table 3-2 and 3Â·3 show the full list of mix designs cast for the experimental program. The upper half of Table 3-2 presents the control mixes and binary blends containing OPC with the type of SCM used. The lower portion of Table 3Â·2 shows the ternary blends completed with OPC, 5% SF and a specific type of SCM. One (1) mix has a ternary blend ofOPC mixed with High-Calcium Fly Ash and GGBFS. Also shown in the upper portion of Table 3Â·2 is the different alkali levels used in the mix designs. For the control mixes, two different mixtures were done at an alkali content of 1.25%. For example, in Table 3Â·2 the alkalinity of 1.25% raised from 1.08 indicates that the original alkali level in the cement was 1.08% Na20e but was raised to 1.25% by adding NaOH to the mixing water. Similarly, the same thing was done with an original alkali level of 0.98% Na20e. For the mixes containing SCM's, all of the mixes listed on Tables 3Â·2 and 3-3 have an alkali level of 1.25% Na20e except where there is an addition "xz" in the mix design box. This

Â· 73-

indicates that two different alkali contents of 1.25 and 0.80% Na20e were used for that particular mix design. Table 3-3 is interpreted exactly as Table 3-2, except that Table 3-3 contains only 10% Pittsburgh aggregate.

The Pittsburgh aggregate was used as the coarse aggregate for this experimental program and the fine aggregate was non-deleteriously reactive sand. When completing the diluted mixes with 10% Pittsburgh aggregate, the reactive coarse aggregate and the non-reactive coarse aggregate were mixed thoroughly to ensure that the total coarse aggregate used in the mix was evenly distributed. The mix design ingredients per cubic meter of concrete (based on the SSD

conditions for the aggregates) are as follows:

OPC+SCM 420 kg

Coarse Aggregate* Fine Aggregate 1026 kg 684 kg

\Vater** 176.4 to 189 litres

* Coarse aggregate includes reactive and non-reactive aggregate where applicable ** Includes superplasticizer where applicable

The coarse aggregate was separated on the 12.5 mm (Yz"), 9.5 mm Ws"), and 4.75 mm (No.4) sieves. One third of the total aggregate mass was taken from each size fraction. The concrete was mixed as per ASTM C192. Three (3) concrete prism specimens measuring (75 x 75 x 275 mm), were cast for each mix in steel moulds with I-inch stainless steel studs embedded in the center of the prism at each end. After casting, the specimens were moist cured at room temperature (23Â°C) using wet burlap and plastic sheets to reduce evaporation. After 24 hours of curing, the specimens were de-molded one by one, and their initial lengths (day zero readings) were measured using a standard length comparator following the test method outlined in ASTM CIS7. The lengths were compared to an Invar bar with a pre-determined length of

-74 -

approximately 285 mm. The effective gage length was taken as 260 mm after adding the length of the embedded studs.

After taking the initial reading at day zero, the samples were then placed in 5 gallon polyethylene pails with airtight lids. The pails and lids were lined with an absorbent micro fibered cloth that helps to retain water and prevent evaporation. 100 mm diameter PVC pipe were cut to a height of 25 mm and were placed in the containers as spacers. A perforated checkerboard rack was placed on top of the PVC pipe spacers so that the prisms would sit upright on the rack 30 to 40 mm above the bottom of the pail. The pail was then filled with water to a depth of 25 mm with the cloth on the side of the walls extending into the reagent water. The airtight pails containing the specimens were transported and stored in a temperature-controlled heat room at 38.0Â°C Â± 2.0Â°C. Subsequent length readings were taken periodically as per ASTM standards. The pails were taken out of the heat room and placed in room temperature 16 to 20 hours before
leng~h

measurement readings were carried out. The lengths were measured with reference to the

invar bar and the change in length was determined as a percentage. The percent expansion of each specimen was calculated as follows:

% Expansion after N weeks = Measured length (N weeks) -- gage length (day zero) x 100 gage length (day zero) The invar bar, which is used as a reference length for each measurement, is expected to change over time due to wearing and excessive use. To compensate for the wear and tear length changes of the invar bar, a correction factor was determined every week by comparing the invar bar to a reference invar bar only used for calibration purposes. Once the readings were corrected, the

-75 -

average expansion readings of three specimens were reported as a percentage for the particular mix design at its age when testing. The results of these findings are presented in Chapter 4.

3.3.2

Microbar Test for ACR

The concrete microbar test is a method that has been proposed by the NRC to evaluate the expansion of concrete due to AAR. This new test method had been adopted from the Chinese test method for alkali-carbonate reactive aggregates (Xu et ai, 2000). RILEM has actually

standardized the test as indicated in Chapter 2. The testing procedure carried out on this portion of the study follows the test method proposed by RILEM AAR-05 and the NRC (GrattenBellew, P.E. et ai, 2003).

The concrete microbars differ from the concrete prisms and mortar bars because its size is in the middle of the two. The concrete microbars used for this study had cross-sections of 40 x 40 mm and gage lengths of 275 mm. The length of the microbar in this study differs from the original Chinese test method length of 160 mm so that the North American length comparator could be used to make subsequent measurements. The microbar moulds were made of teflon and could produce two (2) microbars per mould with stainless steel studs embedded at the ends identical to the concrete prism.

All of the aggregates used to produce the concrete for the microbar test were crushed aggregates and were passed through a 9.5 mm sieve and retained on a 4.75 mm sieve. There was no fine aggregates used in the mixes. The cement used was Type 10 Portland cement with an alkali content of 1.04% Na20e. The alkali content of the cement or any SCM was not taken into

-76 -

consideration because of the high alkali solution that the microbars are saturated in. For all mixes the water to cement ratio was approximately 0.33. The water content was slightly

adjusted for workability and when very fine-grained SCM such as silica fume and metakaolin was used, a portion of the water was replaced by superplasticizer. When reactive and nonreactive aggregates were used, the aggregates were blended in a bowl to ensure an even distribution. The coarse aggregate to cementing materials ratio is 1: 1. Where SCM was used, the replacement level was strictly based on mass and no specific gravity or chemical composition was taken into account.

The mix design ingredients for three microbars (based on the SSD conditions for the aggregates) are as follows:

OPC+SCM 1500 g

Coarse Aggregate* 1500 g

\Vater** 495mL

... Coarse aggregate includes reactive and non-reactive aggregate where applicable ** InCludes superplasticizer where applicable

The mixing procedure is similar to ASTM C305 for mixing mortar. The water is added into the Hobart bowl and then the cement is introduced. After 30 seconds, the water and cement are mixed at slow speed for 30 seconds. The sides of the bowl are scraped down and the paste is allowed to stand for approximately 15 seconds. The cement paste is then thoroughly mixed on medium speed for one minute and additional water is added if required. Once the cement paste had reached the desired consistency, the aggregates are added to the Hobart bowl and mixed by hand. The aggregates were mixed by hand because it has been found that due to the coarse aggregates within the mix, the Hobart mixers do no perform well and may become damaged. Once mixing by hand is completed, the aggregates are sufficiently covered with the cement paste

-77 -

and there is a uniform consistency, the mix can be molded. The mixture was placed inside the molds in two layers and each layer was tamped approximately 25 times to ensure proper consolidation without over consolidation. After the molds had been filled they were vibrated for a few seconds to remove air bubbles from the mixture. The molds were then wet cured in a curing room at 23Â°C and covered with plastic for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the microbars were de-molded and immersed in distilled water in plastic containers. The airtight containers were placed in the oven at 80Â°C for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the containers were removed from the oven and the microbars from each container were quickly patted dry and measured for initial length and mass. This length was considered the zero day length for the microbars. After the initial measurements, the microbars were transferred to aIM NaOH solution at 80Â°C, sealed with saran wrap for evaporation prevention, and were returned to the oven. Subsequent length and mass measurements were made periodically up to 56 days. The percent expansion of each bar is calculated in the same manner as the concrete prism samples. The percent expansion of each specimen was calculated as follows:

% Expansion after N weeks == Measured length (N weeks) - gage length (day zero) x 100 gage length (day zero)

Similarly, there is a correction factor for the invar bar that is taken into account for the final measurements. The results from the microbar test are presented in Chapter 4.

Rapid Chloride Permeability Testing

Chloride ion penetration testing was performed on thirteen (13) mixtures in accordance with ASTM C I 202 except that some samples represent microbar mixtures (no fine aggregate) rather than concrete. Eight (8) mix designs were based on concrete prism mixes and five (5) were

based on concrete microbar mixes. A list of all mixes prepared for the RCPT is presented on Table 3-5 below. Three (3) 100 mm diameter cylinders were cast for each mixture and wet cured for 28-days in a moist room. After 28-days, the cylinders were taken out and cut parallel to the top of the core into 50 mm th ick slices usi ng a water-cooled diamond saw as shown on Figure 3- 1. The top of the cylinders had more paste due to finishing, and the bottom of the cylinder genera lly contained more coarse aggregate due to consolidation. As a resu lt, testi ng was carried out from the portion of the cylinder between 25 mm to 175 mm depth for a better distribution of paste and aggregate.

Figure 3- 1 Typical size of RC PT specimens

After cutting, the slices were washed clean and air dried at room temperature for I ho ur prior to conditioning. The slices were then put inside a vacuu m desiccator for 3 hours ensuring the cut faces were exposed (Figure 3-2). After 3 hours with the vacuum sti ll runni ng, de-aerated water was introduced into the des iccator completely submerging all the spec imens. The specimens

- 80 -

were vacuumed in the desiccator for an additional I-hour at which time the vacuum pump was turned off. Air was allowed to enter the dessicator through the vacuum line and the specimens remai ned in the water for 16 to 20 hours.

Figure 3-2 Conditioning of RCPT specimens in dessicator with vacuum.

Figure 3-3 RCPT setup using the PROOVE it Software

After the conditioning stage, the specimens were taken out of the water bath one by one and sealed with a rubber gasket on one side. A high viscosity specimen-cell sealant was used with a

screen/mesh. The specimens were set on the screen on one half of the cell and the gasket was set in place to seal the specimen to the screen. A 100 mm diameter outer ring covered the

- 81 -

circumference of the specimen and another vulcanized rubber gasket and the other half of the cell was set in place. The two halves of the test cell were clamped together with bolts until there was an air-tight seal. One half of the cell (negative side) was filled with 3.0% NaCl solution and the other half of the cell (positive side) was filled with a 0.3 N NaOH solution. The positive and negative ends of the cell were attached to the power supply using banana clips. The voltage was set to 60V for the 100 mm diameter specimens and the test time was set for a maximum of 6 hours.

Automatic data processing equipment called "PROOVE it" was used to evaluated and determine the results of the test (Figure 3-3). The results of the RCPT and the other test mentioned above are presented in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 4 Results and Analysis
4.1 Concrete Prism Test

The concrete prism expansion measurements were taken periodically for at least two years. The average expansion of three prism specimens was reported as the expansion measurement for the mix. The actual measured expansions of all mixes are listed in Appendix A. If not specified, all concrete prism mixes have an alkali content of 1.25%. AU results for the concrete prism test are compared with the 0.04 % expansion limit suggested in Appendix B ofthe Canadian Standards Association CSA A23.1.
Effect of Alkali Content on Expansion due to ACR

4.1.1

The expansion development of the control mixes with different alkali content is shown on Figure 4Â·1. All mixes contain only 100 percent Pittsburgh aggregate, different low alkali

cement, and no SCM. After one year, the results indicate that all four mixes exceeded the 0.04% expansion limit. As expected, the mix with 1.25% alkalinity had the highest expansion after one year and the mix with 0.60% had the least. However, the two year expansion results show that 0.80% alkalinity mix had the greatest ultimate expansion and the 1.00% alkalinity mix had the least. However, the difference in expansion was not significant. One can argue that all tested levels of alkali contents produced the same expansion. This shows that the expansion would take place even if low alkali cement is used. The reason is most likely due to the regeneration of alkalis which sustain the reaction even at low initial alkali levels.

Effect of Aggregate Dilution on Expansion due to ACR

The expansion of the concrete prism specimens generally followed the expected expansIOn results when d iluting the m ix with non-reactive aggregate. Specificall y, the mix with 100%

reactive (Pittsburgh) aggregate had the highest expansion, and the mix with 5% reactive aggregate had the lowest expansion. It should be noted that all mixes had an alkali level of 1.25%. The expansion results for the fi ve mixes (5%, 7%, 10%, 15% and 20%) that were diluted are shown on Figu re 4-2. The only anomaly noted was that the mix wi th 7% reactive aggregate had a slightly higher expansion than the mix w ith 10% reactive aggregate; however, this slight d ifference in ex pans ion is considered to be negligible since both values are close to the 0.04% expansion lim it.

Effect of Slag

Past literature has shown that the use of slag has not been effective in reducing expansion due to ACR (Williams and Rogers, 1991). The results from this study are shown on Figure 4-3 where the use a replacement level of 30% was used for slag. Two different mixes were carried out, one with an initial alkali level of 0.80% and one with an alkali level of 1.25%. The results show that the use of 30% slag initially inhibits the expansion due to ACR for both mixes. However, at the two year mark the mix with an alkali level of 1.25% surpasses the control mix while the mix with the lower alkali level has a considerably lower overall expansion compared to the control

Effect of Silica Fume

Figure 4-4 shows the concrete prism

results when Silica Fume is used as a

replacement of cement. Replacement levels of 5% and 10% silica fume were used as these are the practical levels used in the industry to maintai n workabil ity and economy. The early age results indicate that the higher the replacement levels of silica fume, the lower the expansion results. However, it was noted that around two years, the mixes wi th silica fume surpass the expansion res ults of the control mix. Further, the 5% and 10% silica fu me mixes have almost identical expansion resul ts at two years regardless of the early age d ifference in expansion. The main benefit of si lica fume was that it reduced the expansion of the concrete prisms at early ages. The mechanism by which th is occurs will be disc ussed in Chapter 5.

Effect of Metakaolin

The use of metakaolin has not previously been tested on the expansion due to ACR. In the first few weeks while hydration is taking place, there is actually shrinkage with metakaolin mixes as opposed to expansion with other SCM. Generally as the replacement level of metakaolin

increases, the expansion decreases due to many reasons that will be discussed later. The results from this study (Figure 4-5) shows that the use of 10% metakaolin significantly reduced expansion due to ACR and 15% metakaolin further reduced expansion due to ACR. Based on the results of Figure 4-5, it is interesting to see whether or not a higher replacement level of metakaolin (more than 15%) would suppress expansion due to ACR enough to the meet the

- 87 -

I-year expansion limit of 0.04% . However, metakaolin is unlikely to be used in the industry at replacement levels higher than 15% due to poor workability.

Effect of High-Calciu m Low Alkali (CH-LA) Fly Ash

The conc rete prism expansion results of mixes containing CH-LA Fly Ash are shown on Figure 4-6. It was antici pated that the use of the CH-LA fl y ash would be beneficial in concrete due to the low alka li leve l compared w ith regular Port land cement. However, as mentioned in the

literature, the high calci um percentage in the CH-LA fl y ash wo uld contribute to expansion, compared to low-calcium fl y ash, due to the higher calcium hydroxide in the system. T he resu lts show that the use of 25% CH-LA fly ash with an alkal i level of 1.25% was not effective in suppressing expansion due to ACR; however, the use of 25% CH- LA fl y ash w ith an alkali level

- 88 -

of 0.80% was much lower than the control mix.

The results also show that even with a

replacement level of 30% CH-LA fly ash, there was no significant reduction in expansion. None of the mixes tested met the 2-year expansion limit of 0.04%.
It is expected that a higher

replacement level of fly ash would continue to suppress the expansion due to the decrease of the alkaline pore solution regardless of the additional calcium hydroxide products.

Effect of Low-Calcium High Alkali (F-HA) Fly Ash

The concrete prism results on Figure 4-7 show that in the early stages, the use of F-HA fly ash reduces the expansion due to ACR compared to the control mix. However, at the two year

read ing, the expansion results show that the F-HA mixes reach a similar expansion level compared with the contro l mix. If this trend continues, the expansion of the mixes using F-HA

- 89 -

would surpass the expansion of the control mix. [t is hypothesized that due to the high amount of al kalis contai ned in the F-HA fly ash, the dedolomitization process is rep lenished due to the excess alkalis. In gene ral, the use of F-HA fl y as h in concrete to control expansion due to ACR is not recommended.

Effect of CI-LA Fly Ash

The conc rete prism expansion results of mixes containing CI- LA Fly Ash are shown on Figure 4-8. It was ex pected that the use of the CH-LA fly ash would be beneficial in concrete due to the low alkali level compared with regular portland cement. The results show that the

use of 15% and 20% C I- LA fly ash with an alkali level of l.25% were effective in reducing

- 90 -

expansion due to ACR. Furthennore, the use of20% CI-LA fly ash with an alkali level of 0.80% significantly reduced the expansion due to ACR; however, the expansion reduction was not lower than the 2-year expansion limit of 0.04%. It is expected that a higher replacement level of fly ash would continue to suppress the expansion due to the decrease of the alkaline pore solution and limited calcium oxide reactants.

surpassed the expansion of the control mix at 91 weeks and at the 2-year mark. Although the mix with 30% CH-MA fly ash did not exceed the control mix's expansion at the 2-year mark, if the trend continues the mix wi ll eventually surpass the expansion of the control mix. The results show that, as the CH-MA fly ash replacement level increases, ultimately the expansion also increases. The increase in expansion is believed to be from the additional alkalis in the fly ash reacting w ith the pore solution to regenerate the dedolomitization process.

4.1.10 Effect of CH-HA Fly Ash As expected, the use ofCH-HA fly ash did not prove to be effective in any of the mixes tested. Figure 4-10 shows that after about two months, the concrete expansion of mixes with CH-HA fly ash exceeded the expansion of the control mix. The high expansion results are caused by the high amount of additional alkalis in the fly ash. Furthennore, the high calcium content of the fly ash contributes more ions for calcium hydroxide to fonn. The additional alkalis and calcium ions from the CH-F A fly ash directly fuel the dedolomitization mechanism and contribute to ACR expansion. The mixes tested contained a high replacement level of CH-HA fly ash. The use of CH-HA fly ash at any replacement level is not recommended for controlling expansion due to ACR.

4.1.11 Effect of Ternary Blends (with Silica Fume)

The use of ternary blend mixes has been proven to beneficial in minimizing the expansion due to ACR compared to a binary blend alone (Shehata and Thomas, 2002). The concrete prism

expansion results of mixes containing ternary blends of portland cement, silica fume, and another SCM is shown on Figures 4-11a and 4-11b. It was found that except for the mix with 25% Slag, all ternary blends had lower expansion results after two years. The mixes that performed the best were those mixes containing some sort of low-alkali fly ash. The CH-LA fly ash had the lowest expansion out of the all the mixes tested, followed by the CI-LA fly ash. Using a ternary blend with 30% Slag did reduce the expansion process for two years, however if the trend continues, the expansion will eventually reach and exceed the expansion of the control mix. Similarly, the expansion of ternary blend mixes with CH-MA fly ash would eventually exceed the control mix's expansion after two years. Overall, the mixes with ternary blends prove to be better than mixes with just Portland cement and binary blends of PC/SCM. However, the expansion results for the ternary blends are still not as good as using metakaolin as a partial replacement of OPC.

4.1.12 Effect of Ternary Blend (with Fly Ash & Slag) A ternary blend mix of slag and CH-MA fly ash was done with the anticipation of reducing the expansion due to ACR. The mix had 30% slag and 20% CH-MA fly ash . Figure 4- 12 shows the concrete prism expansion results of the slag and fly ash ternary blend. Also shown on

Figure 4- 12 is the concrete prism expansion of the ternary blends with silica fume for the same slag and CH-MA fly ash. The results show that while all the mixes exceeded the 2-year

expansion limit of 0.04%, the ternary blend m ix w ith fly ash and slag had a lower expansion than the ternary blends wi th silica fume. The reduced expansion results for the slag and fly ash

ternary blend may be due to the high replacement level of cement, and accordingly lower initial alkali content. However, similar to the silica fume ternary blends, if the expansion trend

continues, the fly ash and slag ternary blend wi ll eventually reach and might surpass the expansion level of the control mix.

4.1.13 Effect of the Amount of SCM
The replacement level or actual the amount of SCM in a mix, has a significant role on the concrete prism expansion results. Figure 4-13 shows the effects of the amount of different SCM (excluding fly ash) on the concrete prism expansion due to ACR. Figure 4-13 shows the amount of slag, silica fume and metakaolin used in the concrete prism mixes and their corresponding 2-year expansion results. From Figure 4-13 we can see that overall, the use of metakaolin was the most effective in controlling the expansion due to ACR, while slag was the least effective. Figure 4-13 also shows the general trend for the replacement level or dosage for the SCM. Generally, the higher the replacement level of SCM, the lower the expansion results will be. Figure 4-13 can be very useful because if similar trends continue we can somewhat determine the optimum SCM dosage that will satisfy the 2-year expansion limit of 0.04%. For example, from the figure, it appears that a minimum dosage of20-25% metakaolin is needed to control the expansion due to ACR. However, due to the nature and fineness of metakaolin, such a high replacement level is not always feasible or economical. The beneficial effects of metakaolin are further discussed in Chapter 5.

4.1.14 Effect of the Amount of Fly Ash
Sim ilar to Figure 4- 13, Figure 4- 14 shows the amount of the different types of fly ash used in the concrete prism m ixes, and their corresponding expansion results. Unlike the other SCM

mentioned in Section 4.1.11, certain types of fly ash do not have a favourable effect on the concrete prism expansion. Figure 4- 14 shows that the amount of CH-HA and CH-MA fly ash have a directly proportional relationship with the concrete ex pansion at replacement levels higher than about 30%. Spec ifically, as the amounts of CH-HA or CH-MA fl y ash increase, the

concrete prism expansion also increases. On the other hand, Figure 4-14 also shows that the use of CH- LA and F-HA fly ash have an inversely proportional re lation hip w ith the concrete prism

- 98 -

expansion. As the amounts of CH-LA or F-HA fly ash increase, the concrete prism expansion decreases. The use of CI-LA fly ash seems to have reached an optimal dosage at a replacement level of 20%. Out of all the fly ash mixes
t~sted,

the CI-LA was most effective in reducing

expansion due to ACR and the CH-HA fly ash was the least effective. Part of the reason why the CI-LA fly ash performed so well was because it had a higher fineness than the F-LA fly ash.

4.1.15 Effect of Aggregate Dilution with SCM The main objective of diluting the reactive aggregate in this study is to produce an expansion level close to 0.04. This would mimic marginally reactive alkali carbonate aggregate, which was

- 99 -

hard to obtain during the duration of this study. After detennining the dilution level required to get an expansion close to 0.04%, the effects of SCM on the expansion was examined. As mentioned in Section 4.1.2, different dilution mixes were made to detennine its effects on the expansion due to ACR. Figure 4-15 shows how the I-year concrete prism expansion changes as the level of dilution increases. The figure shows dilution results for control mixes and mixes using 30% CH-MA fly ash. The results on Figure 4-15 show that for both types of mixes, as the amount of reactive aggregates increase, the concrete prism expansion significantly increases as well. The mixes shown on Figure 4-15 were initially carried out to detennine the best dilution level that could meet the 0.04% expansion limit at I-year. From the results, it was detennined that up to 10% reactive aggregates could be used for the control mix and still remain under the 1year expansion limit.
It was found that the CH-MA mixes, could use up to 15% reactive

aggregates and remain under the limit. It should be noted that the results from Figure 4-15 are not meant to show a regression curve. The results simply show that with the use of CH-MA fly ash, a higher amount of reactive aggregates could be used compared to the control mix and still pass the CSA expansion limit. For all subsequent dilution mixes, 10% reactive aggregates were used to create a marginally reactive aggregate. The concrete prism expansion results of the dilution mixes are presented in Sections 4.1.16 to 4.1.19.

4.1.16 Effect of Slag with 10% Reactive Aggregate Figure 4-16 shows the concrete prism expansion res ults of using 30% and 40% slag with 10% reactive aggregates. The results show that the use of slag with aggregate dilution reduces the expansion due to ACR more than the dilution control mix with 10% reactive aggregates. However, it was found that the expansion with 30% slag was less than the expansion with 40% slag indicating there is an optimum replacement level of slag. However, the values were very close. This is most likely due to the high calcium oxide content in slag, which will be discussed in C hapter 5. It was also noted that for both the 30% and 40% slag mixes, after two year measurements, the expansion results did not exceed th 0.04% limit.

4.1.17 Effect of Metakaolin with 10% Reactive Aggregate
Two dilution mixes with 10% reactive aggregates were tested using metakaol in. Similar to the non-dil uted mixes, replacement levels of 10% and 15% metakaolin were used. The resu lts of the aggregate di lution mixes wi th metakaolin are shown on Figure 4- 17. As seen on the figure, using metakaolin significantly reduces the concrete prism ex pansion results compared to the control mix. Furthermore, after two years of testing, the expansions of both mixes were

sign ifican tl y under the 0.04% expansion li mit. The only difference in the res ults compared wi th the non-di luted mixes is that the amount of metakaol in replaced did not have a considerable

- 102 -

change in results, which is expected since the expansion values are very small.

Figure 4-17

shows that using 10% and 15% replacement levels of metakaolin yield practically the same expansion results. If the similar trend continues, the use of metakaolin would continue to result in a reduction in expansion due to ACR. With aggregate dilution and only 10% metakaolin, economic and durable mixes could be produced.

4.1.18 Effect of Fly Ash with 10% Reactive Aggregate Figures 4-18 and 4-19 show' the effects of using aggregate dilution with the different types of fly ash on expansion due to ACR. Figure 4-18 shows the concrete prism expansion results with F-HA and CI-LA fly ash, while Figure 4-19 shows the results with CH-HA and CH-MA fly ash. According to Figure 4-18, the use of F-HA and CI-LA fly ashes both reduce the concrete prism expansion results more than the control mix, with the CI-LA fly ash producing the most favorable results. It was noted that for both F-HA and CI-LA fly ashes an optimum amount is required for best results. Both mixes showed an increase an expansion when the replacement level of fly ash changed from 20% to 25%. Nevertheless, all the mixes tested using aggregate dilution with F-HA or CI-LA fly ash had expansion levels lower than 0.04% after two years. Figure 4-19 shows that while the use of CH-MA reduced the expansion due to ACR, the use of CH-HA fly ash increased the expansion results compared to the control mix. In addition, the use of CH-HA fly ash with 10% reactive aggregates exceeded the I-year expansion limit of 0.04%. Figure 4-19 shows that using higher replacement levels of CH-MA fly ash reduce the concrete prism expansion results. All dilution mixes with CH-MA fly ash did not exceed the 0.04% expansion limit after two years. The mix with 30% CH-MA fly ash had a higher expansion than the mix with 40% and 50% CH-MA fly ash. However, the mix with 40% CH-MA fly ash was only slightly more expansive than the mix with 50% CH-MA fly ash. This suggests that in addition to economic reasons, a significant reduction in expansion is not seen when using higher replacement levels of CH-MA fly ash (greater than 50%). Overall, the lowest expansion results for all fly ash mixes tested were those using CI-LA fly ash, followed by mixes containing high replacement levels of CH-MA fly ash. From the results, it is clear if a marginally reactive

- 104-

aggregate were to be used with a moderate replacement level (20-30%) of C I-LA fly ash, the expansion would meet the 0.04% expansion limit after two years.

Whi le the use of ternary blends with aggregate di lution reduce the expansion due to ACR, fo r economic reasons the use of the same SCM with a binary blend and aggregate dilution would produce similar expansion results.

4.2 Concrete l\ficrobar Test
Concrete microbars were cast and measurements were taken periodically in accordance with the RILEM AAR-05 test method. While the test method only requires a month of testing, microbar measurements in this study were carried out for 56-days. The average expansion of three

concrete micro bar specimens was reported as the expansion measurement for the mix. The actual measured expansions of all mixes are listed in Appendix A. All concrete microbars were exposed to the same environment, submersed in aIM solution of NaOH stored at 80Â°C. It is believed from the earlier work of Xu et at (2000) that an expansion limit of 0.1 0% after 28-days would be an effective criterion for ACR susceptible aggregates. However, there is still some skepticism whether this limit is acceptable since it may vary for different aggregates. For the analysis in this thesis, all mixes will be compared to the control mix containing no SCM, as well as the corresponding results of the concrete prism mixes.

4.2.1

Effect of Aggregate Dilution on Concrete Microbars

Six (6) different dilution mixes ranging from 5% reactive aggregates to 100% reactive aggregates were tested for expansion using the concrete microbars. The results of concrete microbar dilution mixes are shown on Figure 4-21. The expansion of the concrete microbar specimens generally followed the expected trend when diluting the mix with non-reactive aggregate. Specifically, the mix with 100% reactive (Pittsburgh) aggregate had the highest expansion, and the mix with 5% reactive aggregate had the lowest expansion. The only anomaly noted was that the mix with 7% reactive aggregate had a slightly lower expansion than the mix with 5% reactive aggregate after about 3 weeks. The microbar mixes generally follow the same expansion trend as the concrete prism expansion mixes mentioned in Section 4.1. Visually, the

- 108-

most notable difference in the microbar graph and the concrete prism graph is that the microbars have a more linear trend line. However, this is most likely due to the accelerated nature of the microbar test including the abundant supply of alkalis.

4.2.2

Effect of Slag on Concrete Microbar Expansion

As noted previously, past literature has shown that the use of slag has not been effective in reducing expansion due to ACR. The results from the concrete prism show that initially slag does reduce the expansion due to ACR, but at about two years the effects of slag have no benefit. The results of the concrete microbar expansion with the use of slag are shown on Figure 4-22. Only a single mix was carried out which had a replacement level of 30% slag. Similar to the

- 109 -

concrete prism results, initially the slag reduces the microbar expansion; however, after 40 days the microbar mix with slag- started to exceed the expansion of the microbar control mix. While the trend of the microbar mix may be the same as the concrete prism expans ion results, the magni tude of the expansion is much different. The microbar mixes seem to have a smaller

deviation in ex pans ion compared to the concrete prism mixes. Specifically, the microbar mix with slag has on ly a small difference in expansion (about 0.05%) throughout the entire 56-day period.

4.2.3

Effect of Silica Fume on Concrete Microbar Expansion

In addition to the slag mix, Figure 4-22 shows the concrete microbar expansion results when silica fume is used as a replacement of cement. A replacement level of 10% silica fume was used to maintain workability and economy. Similar to the concrete prism results, the early age results of the microbar expansion indicate that the expansion is reduced compared to the control mix. However, it was noted that around the 21-day reading that the mix with silica fume surpass the expansion results of the control mix. The results from the microbar test suggest that silica fume is not effective in controlling expansion due to ACR. The microbar results do not coincide with the concrete prism results when silica fume is used as a SCM. Figure 4-22 also shows the concrete microbar results for a ternary blend mix with 5% silica fume and 30% slag. While neither the slag nor the silica fume mix alone proved to be effective in reducing the microbar expansion, the ternary blend mix showed a slight reduction in the concrete microbar expansion. The ternary blend mix results for the concrete microbars are similar to the expansion results for the concrete prisms.

4.2.4

Effect of Metakaolin on Concrete Microbar Expansion

Two microbar mixes were completed using metakaolin at replacement levels of 10% and 15%. The use of metakaolin was expected to produce much lower expansion results compared with the control mix. However, as shown on Figure 4-23, both microbar mixes with metakaolin had a higher expansion than the control mix at 56-days. The expansion of the mix with 15%

metakaolin initially had a lower expansion than the control mix, but at around day 35, the expansion of the metakaolin mix surpassed the control mix. The results from the concrete

microbar test do not have simi lar results to the concrete prism mixes and therefore cannot be correlated well.

Effect of Fly As h on Concrete Microbar Expansion

Four different types of fl y ashes were used in the concrete microbar mixes to determine the effects of each type on the expansion due to ACR. Figure 4-24 shows the concrete microbar expansion results of the different fly ash mi xes tested. The best fl y ash which reduced the concrete microbar expansion was the mix with 20% CI-LA fl y ash. The worst fly ash tested was the mix containing 40% CH-HA, followed by the mix with 30% CH-LA and the mix with 30% CH-MA fly ash. Only the mix with CI-LA fly ash had a lower expansion than the control

mix.

A ternary blend mix containing 5% silica fume and 20% CIÂ·LA fly ash was also

completed. The results from the concrete microbar test show that the ternary blend mix further reduced the expansion due to ACR. Comparing the microbar results with the concrete prism test, some mixes show similar performance while others do not. The CIÂ·LA and CH-HA microbar mixes agree with the concrete prism expansion because they both have respectively, a lower expansion and a higher expansion than the control mix. Both the CH-LA and CH-MA concrete prism mixes had a lower expansion than the control mix but the micro bar results have a higher expansion than the control mix. While these results do not agree, perhaps if the concrete prism measurement were to be carried out for a longer period of time, the CH-LA and CH-MA mixes would surpass the expansion of the control mix. At this time it is inconclusive whether or not the microbar mixes are a suitable measurement for detecting expansion due to ACR for fly ash mixes.

Effect of Aggregate Dilution and SCM

Two (2) mixes containing 10% reactive aggr gate and one type of SCM were used. One mix had 10% metakaoli n whi le the other mix had 25% CI-LA fly ash. The ex pansion results of the concrete microbar test for these two mixes are shown on Figure 4-25 . The different series on Figure 4-25 appear to be undu lating due to the small scale at which they are plot. The results show that while the dil ution reduced the expansion due to ACR, the SCM did not have a significant impact on the expansion results. The mi x with 10% metakaolin had a higher concrete microbar expansion compared to the control mix with 10% reactive aggregate. Although it

appeared the use of 25% CI-LA fly ash reduced the expansion of the concrete microbar, the fi gure shows that at 56-days the expansion results of the fly ash mix surpass the control mix.

Correlating the Concrete Prism Test with the Concrete Microbar Test

The purpose of the concrete microbar test was to determine if it could be used to evaluate the expansiveness of an aggregate in a shorter period of time than the concrete prism test. From the results mentioned above, a good correlation could not be achieved with certain mixes containing SCM. In particular, the mix with metakaolin showed completely opposite results in the concrete

- 115 -

microbar test compared to the concrete prism test. Two (2) figures were developed to determine the correlation between the microbar test and the concrete prism test. The first figure.

Figure 4-26, shows a correlation with no SCM while Figure 4-27 shows the correlation between the two tests with fly ash as the SCM. As shown on Figure 4-26. a fairly good linear correlation was developed for mixes containing only cement and aggregate. The dilution mixes are plotted on the figure and the resulting R2 correlation is around 0.99. However, it is suggested that this correlation value may not be completely accurate due to the minimal data points. The suggested 0.10% limit for the microbar test. commonly used in the accelerated mortar bar test, will be used to help evaluate the mix. As seen on Figure 4-26, the 28-day limit of 0.10% is plotted for the microbar data and the I-year limit of 0.04% is plotted for the concrete prism test. The mixes plotted on the lower left quadrant are mixes that pass both limits of the concrete microbar test, and the concrete prism test. Figure 4-27 shows the correlation between the microbar test and the concrete prism test for mixes containing different types of fly ash. The R2 correlation value for mixes containing fly ash was found to be around 0.89. Again, due to the minimal data points this correlation value may not be very accurate. It was found that only the mix with 10% reactive aggregate and 25% CI-LA fly ash fell within the lower left quadrant which passed the limits of both the concrete microbar test and the concrete prism test. Based on the two correlation figures, it was decided that the concrete microbar test would not be a good measuring tool for determining the expansion due to ACR of a concrete mix with SCM. However, if only cement and aggregates were to be used, the concrete microbar test could be used as a means of screening the aggregate. The only problem that arises with this is to determine a suitable 28-day expansion limit. Based on Figure 4-27, it is suggested that the 28-day expansion limit be lowered to around 0.04%. If an aggregate is tested for screening using the concrete microbar test and the 28-day

expansion results fall below 0.04%, it is fairly safe to say that the aggregate will perfonn well and should also meet the I-year concrete prism results. The results from this thesis are in general agreement with the earlier work described in the literature (Lu et aI., 2006) which suggested that an expansion criteria of 0.10% at 28-days was detennined as being the highest possible expansion for aggregates to be considered "safe".

4.3 Rapid Chloride Permeability Test
The rapid chloride permeability test was performed on selected mixes to determine the chloride ion permeability as a measure of the concrete permeability to explain the effects of role of permeability on the obtained expansion results Table 4-1 below shows the average permeability readings for concrete prism mixes that were moist cured for 28-days. The results from the permeability test indicated that the mix with the metakaolin had the best permeability rating and therefore was least likely to have high amounts of moisture penetrate through the concrete. In comparison, the control mix had the worse permeability reading followed by the fly ash mixes.
It was noted that while the silica fume mix had a low permeability, the ternary blend mix with

- 118 -

5% silica fume and 30% CI-LA fly ash did not have a much lower permeability. Furthermore, the ternary blend mix was still not as low as the two metakaolin mixes. The results from the permeability test indicate that the reason for the low concrete expansion results for the metakaolin mixes may be due to low ion diffusivity which reduces the rate at which alkalis reach reactive sites within the aggregates. These results will be discussed further in Chapter 5.

Similar to the concrete prism mixes, a few selected mixes from the concrete microbar were tested for permeability. Table 4-2 shows the permeability results for microbar mixes that were moist cured for 28-days. Even though they are not concrete mixes, the permeability results from the test are still compared to ASTM C 1202 for their permeability reading. As seen in the concrete prism test results, the mixes with metakaolin had the best permeability readings. The only significant change in the readings was that the mix with 25% CI-LA fly ash had a higher reading than the control mixes indicating that the permeability of the mix had no effect on its ability to reduce the concrete prism expansion due to ACR. These results will also be discussed further in Chapter 5.

CHAPTERS Discussion
This thesis focused mainly on two objectives: 1. To establish a database on the expansion due to ACR with and without using SCM and understanding the role of alkalis from these SCM, especially when used with marginally reactive carbonate aggregates 2. To validate the use of a rapid and reliable performance test for testing ACR aggregates in concrete with and without SCM.

The experimental program composed of three main tests: 1. The concrete prism test 2. The concrete microbar test 3. The rapid chloride permeability test The method and procedures for these tests were described in Chapter 3 while the results were presented in Chapter 4. In this chapter, the results from all three of these tests are combined and discussed.

5.1

Effect of Alkali Content of the mix on ACR

In general, as the alkali content of the mix goes up, the expansion due to ACR is expected to increase since there are more alkalis in the concrete's pore solution to fuel the ACR mechanism. Furthermore, the dedolomitization reaction regenerates alkalis causing the ACR reaction to keep occurring. However, it is expected that the short term effects of the alkali content are different than the long term effects. As shown on Figure 4-1, the mix with the highest alkali content had

121

the highest expansion at the early stages. This is because there was an abundant amount of alkalis in the alkali rich'mixes that could be used to fuel the ACR mechanism right away. Also, the C-S-H could not bind excess alkalis in the mixes with a high alkali content at early ages. On the other hand, at the later stages Figure 4-1 shows the expansion of the mixes with the lower alkali content were about the same if not higher than the mixes with the high alkali content. Rogers and Hooten (1992) reported cracking and expansion of concrete containing Pittsburgh aggregate and a low-alkali cement of 0.56% Na20e. In this study, the mix with the lowest

alkalinity tested was 0.60% Na20e which supports Rogers and Hooten's work in proving that even with using low-alkali cement expansion due to ACR is inevitable due to the regeneration of alkalis. As mentioned in the literature (Swenson and Gillott, 1960) the ACR mechanism will keep occurring until either dolomite or portlandite is exhausted. Keeping this proposed

mechanism in mind, all the mixes contained the same amount of dolomite and portlandite. The only difference in the mix was the amount of alkalis (Na20e) added to the mix. The results indicate that the high amount of alkalis initially increases the rate of expansion but does not necessarily increase the ultimate magnitude of the expansion for control mixes (without SCM) only. Again, this is because alkali ions are more readily available for the reaction to take place while in the low alkali content mixes, the alkalis have to be regenerated from the dedolomitization process. The dedolomitization process would therefore continue to occur until the dolomite or portlandite is exhausted. Since all mixes have the same amount of portlandite and dolomite, the magnitude of the expansion should be the same for all mixes, it just may take a longer time for low alkali mixes to reach that point. The results therefore support the literature that dedolomitization is a self-sufficient process.

5.2

Effect of Aggregate Dilution on ACR

In the case of highly reactive aggregates such as the Pittsburgh Aggregate used in this study, the only effective way to control the expansion due to ACR was through aggregate dilution (either with or without SCM). According to ASTM C 1105, dilution to control ACR should be: a maximum of 20 % reactive rock in the coarse aggregate, 20 % reactive rock in the fine aggregate, or a total of 15 % reactive rock if the coarse and fine aggregate both contain reactive rock. However, we have shown in Chapter 4 that a minimum dilution of 10% reactive Pittsburgh aggregate should be used to control the expansion due to ACR. Based on the suggested

mechanism of ACR, the dedolomitization process will keep occurring until either all the portlandite or dolomite is exhausted. By reducing the amount of reactive carbonate aggregates in the mix, we are also reducing the dolomite content in the mix, and hence reduce the process of ACR and its associated expansion. The aggregate dilution results for the microbars presented in Section 4.2.1 followed a similar trend as the concrete prism results. If the 28-day expansion limit of 0.10% proposed by RILEM is applied, it would appear that a higher amount (approximately 50%) of reactive Pittsburgh aggregate could be used and still meet the limit. However, from the results of the concrete prism test we know this is not true. While the microbar test is designed to be a rapid test to determine possible reactive aggregates, it does not address the complete tribulations of the ACR mechanism. The author believes the main reason why the aggregate dilution mixes for the microbars were so skewed from the concrete prism results was due to the smaller nominal aggregate size of the Pittsburgh aggregates in the microbar mixes. The aggregate size in the microbars ranged from 4.75 mm to 9.5 mm. According to Walker (1978), it was found that the larger coarse aggregates contributed more to ACR expansion than the fine-grained particles.

- 123 -

Since the microbars contained smaller size aggregates, the magnitude of expansion due to ACR would not be as high' as the concrete prism mixes. While the microbar test increases the

dedolomitization reaction, the test still needs to compensate for the reduction in aggregate size. Another option to put the microbar test to better predict the expansion would be to reduce the acceptance limit. Using Figure 4-21 and the findings from the concrete prism test indicating that a maximum of 10% reactive Pittsburgh aggregate is needed to control the reaction, the microbar expansion limit should also be around 0.04%. However, this limit might not be appropriate for

other aggregates, particularly silica reactive aggregates.

5.3

Effect of Slag on ACR

From the results in Chapter 4, it was seen that slag was not very effective in controlling the expansion due to ACR in both the concrete prisms and the concrete microbars. Not much

literature has been carried out in terms of the mechanism by which slag effects AAR. One theory suggested by the author argues that since slag has a higher CaO content than OPC, there is a greater possibility of producing Ca(OHh in slag concrete than in normal concrete. In ACR, the increased availability of Ca(OH)2 may lead to a reaction with Na2C03 formed by dedolomitization and regenerate NaOH. Therefore, slag may lead to more alkali regeneration due to the increased availability of Ca(OH)2 and thus prolong the expansion mechanism at later ages. This may partly be the reason why Rogers and Hooten (1992) found that the use of 50% slag with low-alkali cement was not effective in controlling expansion due to ACR. One study, (Thomas and Innis, 1998) actually found an increase in concrete expansion when slag and carbonate aggregate were used. In this study. the use of 30% slag with an alkali content of

- 124-

1.25% and 0.80% NazOe did not effectively control the expansion due to ACR. However, at early ages (less than 28-days), the use of slag reduced the expansion due to ACR more than the control mix. Further studies must be carried out to determine the alkali binding capacity of slag. One hypothesis is that slag has similar alkali binding properties compared with silica fume. That is to say, slag may initially binds alkalis as a result of hydration, but slowly releases these alkalis to the pore solution which increases the alkalinity and pH. If this is the case, the increased alkalinity leads to an increase in the dedolomitization reaction as well as exposure to water and swelling of clay minerals within the reactive aggregates (Gifford and Gillott, 1995).

The microbar mix with 30% replacement of slag performed almost identical to the control mix. While the results from the microbar mix with slag does not follow the same trend as the concrete prism mixes with slag the end result is still the same. In other words, at late ages the mixes with slag have no beneficial effect on expansion due to ACR. The results of the microbar test are believed to be a contributed by two factors. The first factor is that the reduced size of the reactive Pittsburgh aggregate in the microbars automatically has a lower contribution to the dedolomitization reaction since there is a lower quantity of dolomite (which comes from the aggregate) in the mix. Secondly, since the microbars are submerged in a high alkali solution, the alkalis that may be bound by hydration products in the early ages do not have a significant role and dedolomitization is fueled by the external alkalis. With regards to the effectiveness of slag, any reduction of expansion in the microbar is believed to be from slag's ability to reduce permeability.

- 125 -

While no RCPT samples were actually tested in this study, similar studies (Thomas and Innis, 1998) conducted with slag have shown that concrete with GGBFS have a lower permeability achieved through pore refinement. Pore refinement limits the migration of fluids in the case of ACR, reduces alkalis from migrating to the core of the concrete specimen (prism or microbar). Any reduction in expansion due to ACR in concrete made with only slag is believed to be mainly through the reduction in permeability (Le. the reduction of the rate of migration of fluids) which slows down the ACR mechanism. While it is not clear from this study or past studies, it is believed that at a chemical level the use of slag does not provide any significant advantage such as the ability to bind alkalis in its hydration products.

5.4

Effect of Silica Fume on ACR

As seen in Chapter 4, the use of silica fume alone did not prove to be very effective in controlling the concrete prism and concrete microbar expansions. The results show that in the early stages, silica fume slightly reduces the expansion due to ACR compared to the control mix. However, at later stages the expansion with silica fume exceeded the expansion of the control mix. The late expansion is due to the late alkali-release properties of silica fume (Shehata and Thomas, 2002) which initially bind alkalis during the hydration process but eventually releases them. According to the RCPT results, the silica fume mix had a low susceptibility to chloride ion permeability. This is usually the case in silica fume mixes because the fine particles fill the voids within the concrete matrix and reduces the size of the interfacial transition zone between the aggregate and the paste (i.e. pore refinement). Thus, silica fume mixes are usually more dense and are less likely to have moisture penetration through the surface. The low permeability

- 126 -

of silica fume mixes may be the cause for the initially low expansion results. However, past literature has shown that silica fume mixes, at replacement levels of 5% or 10%, do not show a high capacity to bind or retain alkalis in its hydration products (Shehata and Thomas, 2006). If this is the case, the internal alkalis will react with the Pittsburgh aggregate to cause ACR to occur. Furthermore, the alkalis that are released from the hydration products of silica fume will be in excess of the alkalis that regenerate through the dedolomitization process, and will react with dolomite to cause further deleterious expansion. The inability to effectively bind alkalis at all ages may also be the reason for the concrete microbar results. Since there is an abundance of alkalis in the submersed microbar solution, these alkalis are readily available to react with the Pittsburgh aggregate. The silica fume cannot retain much alkalis in its hydration products so the excess alkalis react more quickly, which leads to higher expansion compared with the control mix. Although the silica fume mix is low in permeability, when submerged in an aggressive solution, the permeability does not last very long and any hairline crack can have very detrimental effects on the expansion.

5.S

Effect of Metakaolin on ACR

The use of metakaolin in concrete showed the best results out of all other SCM with respect to minimizing expansion due to ACR in the concrete prisms. However, the use of metakaolin in the concrete microbars had a higher expansion than the control mix. While there is clearly no correlation between the two tests, the most reliable test is the concrete prism test and the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the microbar test is not a reliable test when metakaolin is used. Khatib and Wild (1996), showed that the porosity and pore size distribution of metakaolin significantly reduces at 14-days and 28-days curing. The metakaolin microbars were only cured

- 127 -

for i-day and then put in a very aggressive solution. The author believes that it may be possible the metakaolin did not completely hydrate and as a result, the pore structure did not get "refined". If this was the case, the aggressive solution would have been able to penetrate or migrate through the microbar easily and attack the specimen internally. Again, the migration of the alkali solution to the core of the specimen would accelerate dedolomitization and cause an increase in expansion. The poor development of C-S-H and the attack from the high alkali solution might also cause the hydration products to decay or become weaker allowing alkalis into the matrix and causing expansion through dedolomitization. The results from the microbar test are sometimes ambiguous (as in this case), which is why there is debate to determine if the microbar test is a reliable test. The microbar test might suffer implications if the necessary precautions are not taken into consideration. In this study, the microbars were put in plastic containers, sealed with an adhesive plastic wrap, and covered tightly with the lid. These precautions were taken to avoid evaporation of water from the NaOH solution. If evaporation occurred, the alkalis in the solution would remain but the concentration would be greater, giving way to a more aggressive solution than anticipated for. The high

expansion results from the microbars made with metakaolin may be a result of evaporation leading to the micro bars being submerged in a much more alkaline solution. Another problem that may arise when dealing with the microbars is the possibility of thermal shock. The concrete microbars are demoulded and measured one day after it has been cast and cured. However, once the initial measurement has been taken, the concrete which is at room temperature, is automatically submersed in water at 80Â°C. Furthermore, when measurements of the microbars are taken periodically, there is a short duration where the microbars cool down (until the measurement is recorded) and are then re-submersed in the 80Â°C solution. The sudden change in

- 128-

temperature results in thermal shock and can cause microcracking of the concrete.

These

microcracks allow ingress of the alkali solution which can then penetrate the core of the microbar specimen and accelerate dedolomitization. Thus, the higher expansion results of the metakaolin microbars may also be due to microcracking caused by thermal shock of the microbars. If we just look at the chemical composition of metakaolin, we see that is has a very negligible alkalinity which means not very much alkalis are contributed from the metakaolin itself. However, the alkalinity from the pore solution from the cement, and the alkalis that are regenerated from dedolomitization are still factors that affect the expansion. The main question is: what makes metakaolin so effective at reducing the expansion due to ACR. The answer lies in the hydration process by which metakaolin undergoes a pozzolanic reaction and reacts with the portlandite (CH) to form supplementary calciumÂ·silicate-hydrate products (De Silva and Glasser, 1992). The supplementary C-S-H that form from metakaolin's pozzolanic reaction have a low Ca:Si ratio, which allows them to entrap alkalis from the pore solution (Kostuch et aI., 2000). As mentioned before, the dedolomitization process will keep occurring until either Keeping this in mind, metakaolin therefore reduces

portlandite or dolomite is exhausted.

expansion due to ACR in two ways: by depleting the amount of portlandite in the mix by means of the pozzolanic reaction and by entrapping the alkali ions from the pore solution thereby reducing the pH and the alkalinity. One study (Ramlochan et ai., 2000) found that while using 10% metakaolin reduced the amount of alkalis in the mix, using 20% metakaolin was able to reduce the alkalinity by more than 75% and the long-term OH- concentration was reduced to less than 0.20 to 0.25 molll (which is the suggested alkalinity required to sustain ASR). Figures 5-1a and 5-lb show the hydroxyl ion concentration of mixes containing highly reactive metakaolin.

In addition to the low expansion results in the concrete prism test, the mixes with metakaolin also performed very well in the RCPT. The metakaolin results from the RCPT were found to be very low to chloride ion penetration which implies that the rate of diffusion is also very low. Metakaolin reduces permeability the same way silica fume does by pore refinement. The very fine metakaolin particles fill most of the voids and pores in the concrete matrix. Since these pores are now smaller and fewer, there is less interconnectivity between pores which decreases permeability. While the permeability definitely plays a role in decreasing the expansion due to ACR, it is still believed that the main reason the metakaolin mixes performed so well was due to metakaolin's ability to deplete a large amount of portlandite and its high capacity to bind alkalis thus signifieantly reducing the alkalinity the mix.

5.6

Effect of Fly Ash on ACR

There is no doubt that different types of fly ash have different effects on concrete expansion due to ACR. Furthermore, the replacement level of the fly ash will also have a significant effect on the expansion. The results shown in Chapter 4 for the various fly ash mixes will now be discussed. The first thing noted after looking at all the fly ash mixes was that none of the fly ash mixes were able to maintain the two-year CSA expansion limit of 0.04%. However, all the fly ash mixes had a lower concrete prism expansion compared to the control mix with no SCM, except for the CH-HA fly ash.

In this study, the moderate-calcium fly ash of Na20e ::s 3.0% at moderate levels (20-30%) performed the best out of the five fly ashes tested. Moreover, the high-calcium fly ash of NazOe > 4.0% performed the worst and the results were not effective even at higher replacement levels (40-50%). An interesting observation in this study was found with the use of the lowcalcium, high-alkali (F-HA) fly ash. The results show that after 2-years, the expansion of the F-HA at low to moderate replacement levels (15-25%) had almost the same expansion results even compared with the control mix. This was also the case when these two ashes were used with alkali-silica reactive aggregate (Shehata et aI, 2009, cement and Concrete Research, in press). The high efficacy of the CI ash was attributable to its higher fineness, compared to the low-calcium ash. In addition, the CI ash might have had more amorphous silica compared to the F ash used in this study. However, no XRD was done to evaluate the glass phases in the two ashes.

- 131 -

The results from the test support the literature that in general, the expansion of fly ash concrete increases as the Na20e ~r CaO contents of the fly ash increases. (Shehata and Thomas, 2002). If we try to relate this theory to ACR and the dedolomitization process it is clear that higher alkali content will cause the expansion due to ACR to occur faster as discussed in Section 5.1. The disadvantage of having a high-calcium fly ash is that it causes a higher pore solution alkalinity at early ages due to the additional Ca2+ ions. This is the reason why we see the mixes with highcalcium fly ash did not prove to be very effective.

The results from the concrete microbar also support the evidence stated above. Figure 4-24 shows the concrete microbar expansion of each type of fly ash mix. The effectiveness of the mix to control the expansion due to ACR are shown in order from top to bottom starting with the worst fly ash with high-calcium and high-alkalinity (CH-HA fly ash). While the microbar results correlated well with the concrete prism results for the fly ash mixes, there is still limited testing with SCM to prove its reliability. The microbar results for fly ash mixes postulate that the most critical factor in determining whether or not a fly ash will be effective is its CaO content. The reason for this is because the microbars are submersed in a highly aggressive alkali solution and after the initial one-day hydration period, the alkali abundance will be high for every mix regardless of the initial alkalinity.

Only a few fly ash mixes were test for chloride ion penetrability by means of the RCPT. It was found that at moderate levels (20-30%), the CI-LA fly ash had a lower permeability than the mix with CH-MA fly ash. This shows that fly ash mixes with different compositions also have a difference when it comes to pore structure refinement. The difference in permeability may be

- 132-

due to the difference in hydration of the two ashes. The CI-LA fly ash most likely forms more stable hydration products as a result of the pozzolanic reaction with Ca(OHh than the CH-MA fly ash which has more Ca2+ ions that will increase the alkalinity of the pore solution.

For the fly ash mixes, the permeability of the different ashes were not so different to constitute the significant difference found in the concrete prism and microbar expansion results. Keeping in mind that the mechanism of ACR causes alkalis to regenerate, the author believes that the CaO content of the fly ash is the main factor to determine whether or not a fly ash will be effective in controlling the expansion due to ACR followed closely by the alkali content of the fly ash. It was proven from the test results provided in Chapter 4 that mixes with high-calcium fly ash have higher expansion than moderate or low-calcium fly ashes of similar alkali levels. In this study for example, the expansion of the concrete mix with CH-LA fly ash was considerably higher than the mix with CI-LA fly ash after two years.

5.7

Effect of Ternary Blends

The ternary blend mixes (containing 5% silica fume with fly ash or slag) usually showed a reduction in the concrete expansion compared with the mixes containing only one type of SCM, especially at the early ages. It was found however that at the later ages (2-years), some ternary blend mixes with silica fume and fly ash gave higher expansion results than the mix with just fly ash alone (i.e. the expansion ofthe mix with CI-LA fly ash was lower than the ternary blend with
SFICI-LA fly ash).

In some cases, the ternary blend mixes formed a synergistic effect.

Specifically, the effects of the ternary blend mixes were better than the sum of the reduction of

- 133 -

the silica fume and the reduction from fly ash alone. The synergistic effect is illustrated in the table below:

Sample Control 5% Silica Fume 20% CH-LA Fly Ash 5/20% SF/CH-LA FA

Expansion at I-year (%) 0.346 0.329 0.298 0.171

Reduction in
% Expansion

0.017 0.048 0.175

Expansion at 2-years (%) 0.365 0.382 0.376 0.306

Reduction in
% Expansion

-0.017 -0.011 0.059

If we look at the 1-year analysis, the sum of reductions in the expansion due to 5% silica fume and 20% high-calcium, low-alkali (CH-LA) fly ash = 0.017 + 0.048 = 0.065%. The reduction in the l-year expansion due to the combined ternary blend of 5/20 SFICH-LA Fly Ash = 0.175%.

From these results we can see that after I-year, the ternary blend reduced the expansion almost 270% more than sum of the reductions from just silica fume or fly ash alone. Similarly, the 2year expansion results show the same synergistic properties. However, looking at the 2-year results we can see that the use of silica fume or 20% CH-LA fly ash alone was not effective in reducing the expansion due to ACR because the expansion results were actually larger than the control mix with no SCM. The ternary blend on the other hand, was able to reduce the 2-year expansion. Although the reduction by the ternary blend was not significant, the 2-year expansion was still reduced enough to be lower than the control mix.

Shehata and Thomas (2002) found that the reason ternary blend mixes perform so well at reducing expansion is partly attributed to the fact that the SCM lowers the pore solution alkalinity. They also found that silica fume was more effective at reducing the alkalinity of the

- 134-

pore solution at early ages, while fly ash was effective at reducing the pore solution alkalinity beyond 28-days. The combined effect of the silica fume and fly ash resulted in a lower pore solution alkalinity at both early and late ages.

The main reason why ternary blends work so well then is because they have a high capacity to bind alkalis and the reduce the availability Ca(OH)2. Initially, the silica fume will have a higher rate of reaction (before fly ash or slag) and this early pozzolanic reaction will cause hydration products to form and bind alkalis before 28-days. At this time however, dedolomitization has already begun but the silica fume is still reducing the alkalinity of the pore solution. After 28days, the silica fume begins to release alkalis and alkalis are also being regenerated from the dedolomitization process. However, also at this time the slower forming hydration products from the fly ash are forming and binding excess alkalis which results in a "net unchanged pore solution alkalinity" (Shehata and Thomas, 2002). Although the fly ash binds alkalis at later ages due to the formation of low-calcium hydration products, alkalis are still being regenerated until the Ca(OHh is exhausted.

The effects of a ternary blend with CH-MA fly ash and slag proved to be more beneficial that a ternary blend of silica fume with either CH-MA or slag. The results are thought to be from a similar early age reduction in the pore solution alkalinity from the moderate level of slag (30%). Similar to the silica fume ternary blends, the addition of fly ash results in the reduction of the pore solution alkalinity at later ages. The slag is believed to bind some alkalis in its hydration products at the early stages although there is no past literature that proves this is the case. Only one study (Adhikari, 2008) prior to this used a ternary blend mix of fly ash and slag for

- 135-

alkali-aggregate reaction. The from that study showed that ternary blends of fly ash and slag reduced expansion due to ASR more than binary blend of just one. This study provides further evidence to this, but the mechanism by which the fly ash-slag ternary blend reduces the expansion needs further research. The fly ash-slag ternary blend mix showed the same

synergistic effects as the silica fume ternary blends in that the reduction in expansion of the ternary blend mix was greater than the sum of the reductions in expansions of the both binary blend mixes ofOPC with fly ash and slag.

Only one ternary blend mix with silica fume and CI-LA fly ash was completed in the concrete microbar experimental program. However, the results from the test showed that the ternary blend performed the best out of all mixes tested. The same synergistic properties were seen with the microbar mix as with the concrete prism results. The fact that the microbars were submerged in a highly aggressive alkali solution did not seem to affect the results of the mix. However, this may also be in part to the low permeability of the mix. The results from the RCPT showed that the ternary blend mix had a very slightly lOWer chloride ion penetrability compared to the mix with just silica fume. Therefore, the ternary blend can be expected to have a reduction in the rate of migration of pore fluids, and thereby reduce susceptibility to ACR.

5.8

Effect of Aggregate Dilution with SCJ\t1

As mentioned, 10% aggregate dilution mixes were completed to determine the effects of SCM on a marginally reactive aggregate. When SCM is used on a "marginally reactive" aggregate, it was found that the expansion due to ACR was reduced below the 0.04% CSA limit in all cases, except for the mixes with CH-HA fly ash. The theories in Sections 5.1 to 5.8 above apply to the

- 136-

same cases of SCM for the marginally reactive mixes. As discussed in Section 5.1, when the aggregate content is diluted, there is less dolomite to react with alkalis in the dedolomitization process. This has a significant impact on the overall reaction over time because there is less dolomite to fuel the reaction and once it is used up, the reaction will cease. Another benefit of aggregate dilution is that there are less reactive aggregates in the mix that will regenerate alkalis due to dedolomitization, hence not as many alkalis will be available compared with the control mixes. The addition of SCM to the diluted mixes uses up Ca(OH)z by the pozzolanic reaction which then limits alkalis from regenerating. The best results in terms of ACR expansion

reduction, were seen with 10% reactive aggregate and the use of metakaolin. The expansion results after 2-years were found to be 0.018% which was more than halfofthe 0.04% CSA limit.
It is expected that this blend with metakaolin should also remain under the CSA limit after 3-

years. The other benefit of using SCM with aggregate dilution is that the amount of reactive aggregates used can be increased, which could result in a cost savings of more expensive nonreactive aggregates. In other words, instead of using 10% reactive aggregates to control the expansion due to ACR, a mix with 20% reactive Pittsburgh aggregate could be used with 30% CH-MA fly ash and produce similar expansion results, as shown on Figure 4-15 in Section 4.1.15. Not much work has been focused on diluting aggregates and the use of SCM, therefore, the long term effects of diluting aggregates is unknown. For this reason, it is

recommended that monitoring of the diluted mixes be carried out until the three year measurements are complete. From the results from Chapter 4 and the discussion above, it

appears that a marginally reactive aggregate with SCM could effectively control the deleterious expansion due to ACR in concrete.

CHAPTER 6 Conclusion
6.1 Summary

The purpose of this research was to determine the effects of different types of SCM on the expansion due to ACR. Taking this into consideration, a database can be established which can be used by the industry to determine the most effective ways to reduce expansion due to ACR if a reactive carbonate aggregate is used in concrete. This research also focused on the newly standardized concrete microbar test to determine its validity as a quick and reliable method of determining an aggregate's susceptibility to ACR.

This research was comprised of three main experimental components. The first and main portion of this research focused on the concrete prism test. The concrete microbar test was also used to determine the effects of SCM in this new test and to provide results on the validity of the test. The RCPT ended off the experimental program and was carried out to determine whether permeability or chemical reactions within the concrete played a more important role in reducing the expansion due to ACR.

The effects of SCM on ACR were predominantly evaluated based on the expansion results. The effects of binary blends and ternary blends of SCM were tested in both the concrete prism expansion test and the concrete microbar test. Furthermore, concrete mixes were completed using aggregate dilution where the reactive Pittsburgh aggregate was limited to 10 percent of the total aggregate mass to make a "marginally reactive" aggregate. The effects of SCM were also investigated on this marginally reactive aggregate. The permeability results determined the ability of the SCM to reduce the pore structure of the concrete which would lead to a reduction in the rate of migration of fluids. As mentioned, a dense or refined pore structure limits the

moisture within the concrete matrix and limits the expansion due to AAR.

6.2

Conclusions

The following conclusions have been drawn from the results of the experimental program

I. The amount of alkalis in the mix, particularly when no SCM is used, does not determine the ultimate expansion due to ACR. However, the higher the amount of alkalis, the faster the rate of expansion. 2. As expected, the expansion due to ACR is directly proportional to the amount of reactive aggregates in the mix. The higher the amount of Pittsburgh aggregate, the greater the expansion. This is due to the higher dolomite content which fuels the dedolomitization reaction. It was found that a "marginally reactive" aggregate could be established when 10 percent reactive Pittsburgh aggregate is used. 3. The use of slag as a partial replacement of cement was not effective in reducing the expansion due to ACR at moderate levels (25-30%). The use of slag initially reduces the expansion due to ACR but at late ages, the mixes with slag surpassed expansion of the control mix. This is likely due to initial alkali binding by slag that delays the expansion. 4. The use of 5-10% of silica fume as a partial replacement of cement initially reduced the expansion due to ACR. However, at late ages the silica fume mixes exceed the

expansion of the control mix. The results are believed to come from the hydration of silica fume which initially binds alkalis at early ages but cannot retain these alkalis and as such, release alkalis into the pore solution at later ages.

5. The use of metakaolin at replacement levels of 10-15% showed the greatest reduction in expansion due to ACR compared with any other SCM. Metakaolin is believed to reduce expansion due to ACR in three (3) ways:

i. By reducing the amount of portlandite (CH) by means of a pozzolanic
reaction since portlandite is essential for the regeneration of alkalis.

- 139-

11.

By fonning secondary C-S-H hydration products which has high capacity to entrap alkalis and significantly reduce the OH- concentration.

111.

By significantly reducing the penneability of the mix and limiting moisture migration to the reactive sites.

6. The use of fly ash at moderate levels (20-40%) generally reduces the expansion due to ACR except when a high-calcium high-alkali fly ash is used. This study found support to show that fly ash mixes with a low-calcium content and/or a low-alkali content perfonn better and have less deleterious expansion due to ACR than mixes with a high-calcium or high-alkali content.

7. Ternary blend mixes consisting of 5% silica fume and one other type of SCM lowered the expansion due to ACR more than one type of SCM alone. Many mixes showed that ternary blends cause a synergistic effect on the reduction due to ACR (i.e. the reduction in expansion caused by the ternary blend is greater than the sum of reductions caused by each type of SCM individually.

8. Ternary blend mixes with Portland cement, fly ash and slag were found to reduce the expansion due to ACR more than the ternary blends with silica fume and the same fly ash or slag. However, it was noted that the cement replacement percentage of the fly ash and slag ternary blend was much more than the ternary blends containing silica fume.

9. In general, it was found that as the replacement percentage of silica fume, slag, or metakaolin increased, the expansion due to ACR decreased. However, it was found that most fly ash mixes often had an optimum replacement level to reduce the expansion due to ACR.

10. As the dilution or the percentage of reactive Pittsburgh aggregate increased the expansion due to ACR increased. It was noted that less than 10 percent reactive aggregates were needed to control ACR to below the CSA limit of 0.04%. However, it was also noted that if SCM is used, the amount of reactive aggregates could be increased while still

- 140-

maintaining the CSA limit. For example, when 30% CH-MA fly ash is used, the amount of reactive aggregates needed to control ACR below the CSA limit increased to about 20 percent.

11. When slag, is used at moderate to high replacement levels (40-50%) on a "marginally reactive" aggregate, the expansion due to ACR is reduced enough to meet the CSA limits. Similarly, the use of meta kaolin at low replacement levels (10-15%) on a marginally reactive aggregate, the expansion due to ACR is significantly reduced below the CSA limit. The use of fly ash at moderate replacement levels on a marginally reactive aggregate was generally shown to reduce the expansion due to ACR below the CSA expansion limit except when a high-calcium high-alkali fly ash is used.

12. The concrete microbar mix for the control mixes showed a good correlation when compared with the expansion results from the concrete prism test. However, the results of the two tests differed greatly in some instances when SCM was used in the mix. The concrete microbar test seems to be an effective test method for screening reactive aggregates without SCM. However, the author believes that if an aggregate's expansion exceeds the expansion limit by RILEM for the concrete microbar test, it should not necessarily be ruled an aggregate susceptible to ACR. Further testing should be done with the concrete prism test to validate the reactivity of the aggregate.

13. The results from the Rapid Chloride Permeability Test showed that the metakaolin and ternary blend mixes had the lowest chloride ion permeability while the control mixes had the highest permeability followed by the fly ash mixes. While the results from the RCPT generally have a directly proportional relationship to the concrete prism expansion of the same mix (Le. as the permeability decreases, the expansion due to ACR decreases), it is believed that permeability is not as significant as the role of alkalis and the type SCM in the mix that control expansion due to ACR.

- 141 -

The use of SCM does not worsen the expansion and deterioration of concrete containing alkali-carbonate reactive aggregates, especially in the case of marginally reactive aggregate.

6.3

Recommendations

The following recommendations are made strictly based on the results obtained in this thesis:

1. The curing method in the RILEM test method for concrete microbars only allows one day of curing before exposing to an 80Â°C water bath. After two days the concrete micro bars are exposed to a very aggressive solution ofNaOH. It was believed that for some mixes containing SCM, the curing process could not be developed in only two days and the after exposing the microbars to an aggressive solution the hydration product such as C-S-H could be compromised or damaged. It is recommended that the microbars be cured for at least 7-days to allow hydration to take place properly, and then start the conditioning stages for the micro bar test. 2. The concrete microbar test should be tested further to determine its validity when SCM is used. From this study, the mixes containing SCM did not perform similarly to the concrete prism mixes. However, it should be noted that

corresponding

recommendation NQ. 1 mentioned above may compensate for these results. 3. It is recommended that further studies on the mechanism of slag be carried out. The mechanism by which slag "binds" alkalis in its hydration products and releases them into the pore solution has not been focused on and could provide evidence why slag mixes expand at later ages. 4. Research specifically focused on ternary blends containing portland cement, slag, and fly ash should be continued. While synergistic properties were found in this research it is recommended that the mechanism of this type of ternary blend be studied as well as the different possible combinations.

- 142-

5. It is strongly recommended that further laboratory tests and field trials be conducted on mixes with metakaolin. There seems to be a great potential for the use of metakaolin in reducing the expansion due to ACR. Furthennore, metakaolin provides durability by refining the pore structure of concrete and increases the mechanical characteristics of the concrete including the compressive strength. Metakaolin in addition to aggregate dilution could be a possible solution to severe deleterious expansion due to ACR.
