Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate the microstructures, tensile lap shear strength, and fatigue resistance of 6022-T43 aluminum alloy joints welded via a solid-state welding technique­ultrasonic spot welding (USW)­at different energy levels. An ultra-fine necklace-like equiaxed grain structure is observed along the weld line due to the occurrence of dynamic crystallization, with smaller grain sizes at lower levels of welding energy. The tensile lap shear strength, failure energy, and critical stress intensity of the welded joints first increase, reach their maximum values, and then decrease with increasing welding energy. The tensile lap shear failure mode changes from interfacial fracture at lower energy levels, to nugget pull-out at intermediate optimal energy levels, and to transverse through-thickness (TTT) crack growth at higher energy levels. The fatigue life is longer for the joints welded at an energy of 1400 J than 2000 J at higher cyclic loading levels. The fatigue failure mode changes from nugget pull-out to TTT crack growth with decreasing cyclic loading for the joints welded at 1400 J, while TTT crack growth mode remains at all cyclic loading levels for the joints welded at 2000 J. Fatigue crack basically initiates from the nugget edge, and propagates with "river-flow" patterns and characteristic fatigue striations.

1. Introduction The required reduction of climate-changing, environment-damaging, and human death-causing emissions is propelling the transportation industry to improve fuel efficiency [1­6]. Vehicle lightweighting is one of the most effective methods to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Lightweight aluminum alloys have been increasingly used in the automotive industry due to their low density, high specific strength, superior ductility, machinability, recyclability, and environmental friendliness [7­12]. The manufacturing of lightweight vehicles inevitably involves welding and joining processes. Welding is indeed an essential aspect of automobile manufacturing, as emphasized by Bhadeshia [13] and Gould [14]. Resistance spot welding (RSW) is a well-established traditional joining technology for steels in auto-body construction. However, when it is used to weld aluminum alloys,

some defects (gas pores, cracks, contraction cavity, void, etc.) may occur, leading to unstable weld quality, along with large energy consumption (about 20 kWh per 1000 joints) and short electrode life [10,15,16]. Some other joining techniques have thus been explored, including self-piercing riveting, adhesive bonding, and laser welding. The adhesive bonding and self-pierce riveting would increase the weight of the body structures and the cost of surface treatment [17,18]. Fusion welding techniques like laser welding are limited again due to the presence of potential defects in the weld of aluminum and magnesium alloys [15,19­21]. Therefore, solid-state spot welding techniques have been developed to join lightweight aluminum and magnesium alloys. One method is friction stir spot welding (FSSW) [12,16,22­29], and the other is ultrasonic spot welding (USW) [16,30,31]. USW is considered an emerging technology, which is being investigated as a candidate replacement technology for RSW in the welding of aluminum alloys [14], due to its shorter weld cycle (typically <1 s), lower energy consumption, environmental friendliness, and superior joint strength [12,16,22­26]. There are a number of studies on similar and dissimilar solid-state welding of Al alloys, including 2009, 5754, 6061, and 6111 alloys as well as Al/Mg/Al tri-layered clad sheet [15,25,30­39]. For example, Bakavos and Prangnell [32] studied ultrasonic spot welded (USWed) AA6111-T4 joints along with the joining mechanisms and microstructural changes. The failure load increased with increasing welding energy, a peak load value was reached, and then the failure load decreased with increasing energy. It was observed that the extensive plastic deformation occurred within the weld zone which is not only localized at the interface but develops throughout the entire thickness of the welded sheet [15,25,32,40,41]. A similar trend of changes in the tensile lap shear failure load was reported in [30,35] for the 5754 Al alloy and in [39,42] for the ZEK100 Mg alloy. Chen et al. [38] showed that the deformation at a high strain rate of ~103 s-1 during USW of the Al 6111-T4 Al alloy could considerably increase the vacancy concentration at the weld interface, which was estimated to be ~100 times higher than that in a conventionally solution-treated and quenched material. Haddadi and Tsivulas [15] also conducted USW of the AA6111-T4 alloy, and observed that the "folds" or "crests" appeared at a longer welding time and the microstructure and texture varied significantly depending on the location within the weld. Zhang et al. [30], Mirza et al. [33], and Macwan et al. [35] studied the USWed AA5754 alloy joints along with the tensile and fatigue resistance, and they observed the necklace-like structure consisting of fine grain sizes along the weld interface. While the effect of process parameters (vibration amplitude, welding time) on the tensile and fatigue properties of the USWed Al6022 joints was studied [43,44], to the authors' knowledge, no detailed microstructural evolution, especially via electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis, is available in the literature. In the present work, a detailed microstructural characterization is performed by using EBSD, with emphasis on the effect of welding energy on the microstructure evolution, grain growth, and grain boundary misorientation. The lap shear tensile properties and fatigue resistance will also be evaluated in relation to the welding energy. 2. Materials and Methods The material used in this study is a 1.3 mm thick sheet of Al6022-T43 alloy, with its nominal chemical composition listed in Table 1. The USW is conducted using a 2.5 kW dual-wedge reed Sonobond MH2016 HPUSW system operated at 20 kHz in an energy mode. The welding parameters used are shown in Table 2. The welding energy (Q) is determined by the level of power (P) and weld time (t), where Q = P × t. For example, a welding energy of 1000 J at 2 kW is equivalent to ~0.5 s. The test coupons with dimensions of 80 mm length and 15 mm width are sheared for the lap tensile tests and fatigue tests, where the length direction is parallel to the sheet rolling direction. Prior to welding, the sample surface is ground using 120 grit sand paper, cleaned by ethanol, and dried by compressed air. During USW, the welding tip is positioned at the center of a 20 mm overlap with a vibration direction perpendicular to the rolling direction.

The USWed samples for electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) examinations are cut along the weld joints center and parallel to the vibration direction using a slow diamond cutter, and then are cold-mounted using epoxy and mechanically polished with abrasive papers, diamond paste, and colloidal silica. EBSD analyses are carried out at a step size of ~0.8 µm by means of an Oxford integrated AZtecHKL advanced EBSD system with NordlysMax2 and AZtecSynergy along with a large area analytical silicon drift detector. An acceleration voltage of 20 keV, a working distance of 15 mm, and a sample tilt angle of 70 are selected for acquiring the data. AZtecHKL and MTEX software are chosen to analyze the EBSD data. Fairly high indexed EBSD solutions are obtained for all the samples (i.e., 90.0% for the BM; 86.7% for USWed joint made with a welding energy of 1400 J; 79.4% for 800 J). Hence only low noise reduction filters are applied for analyzing the EBSD results. When the EBSD data is rotated, a CS1 data acquisition coordinate system and normal projected maps (IPF-Z) in AZtecHKL software are used. The tensile shear tests are performed by a fully computerized United testing machine at a constant crosshead speed of 1 mm/min in air at room temperature to acquire the maximum failure load. Load-controlled fatigue tests are conducted using a fully computerized Instron 8801 servo-hydraulic testing system at different maximum cyclic loads. A load ratio of R (Pmin /Pmax ) = 0.2, a frequency of 50 Hz, and a sinusoidal waveform are selected for the tests. Two spacers with a thickness of 1.3 mm, width of 15 mm, and length of 35 mm are attached at both ends of the specimen to avoid the specimen bending moment and rotation during the tensile and fatigue tests. The fracture surfaces of the selected tensile and fatigue failed samples are examined via SEM to identify fracture mechanisms. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Microstructure Characterization Figure 1 shows several typical cross-sections of ultrasonic spot welded joints made with varying levels of welding energy (a­c), and the Sonotrode welding tip tooth penetration as a function of welding energy (d). It is seen that the thickness and pattern of the teeth change with increasing energy. At a lower energy of 800 J (Figure 1a), the tip penetration is shallow and the dent is not fully formed due to the low temperature arising from friction and vibration, which is not enough to generate sufficient plastic deformation because of low energy and short welding time. At this low energy level, the pattern is almost kept in line, i.e., the upper and lower tip tooth dents are oriented vertically as indicated by the vertical dotted line in Figure 1a. Also, the workpieces do not exhibit bending and the reduction in the sheet thickness in-between the welding tips is small at this energy level. With increasing energy to 1400 J and 2000 J (Figure 1b,c), the dents are fully formed due to the materials being softened enough and the penetration being deep. In Figure 1b,c, the red tilted dotted lines and circles show that the sheets become increasingly thinner and the pattern changes to shearing between the welding tip teeth. It means that they are out of phase or out of alignment due to the displacement caused by severe deformation at higher levels of welding energy. A similar phenomenon was also observed in [15,45]. It can be seen from Figure 1c that at higher levels of energy, the pattern changes and bending occurs more obviously, in comparison with Figure 1b. As seen from

Figure 1d, the welding tip penetration increases almost linearly with increasing welding energy from a Materials 2017, 10, 449 of 16 depth of ~330 µm to ~960 µm. Patel et al. [46], Macwan et al.

It is seen from Figure 2a that the BM has a somewhat deformed grain structure that is elongated along the rolling direction (RD), where the grain size varies between 12­26 µm with an average size It is seen from Figure 2a ultra-fine that the BM has a somewhat deformed grain structure that is elongated of ~19 µm. An equiaxed "necklace"-like grain structure occurs along the welding line, as along the rolling direction (RD), where the grain size varies between 12­26 µ m with an average size seen in Figure 2b,c. This is likely due to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) during USW. Similar results were reported in a USWed 5754 Al alloy [33]. The equiaxed grain size along the of ~19 µm. An equiaxed ultra-fine "necklace"-like grain structure occurs along the welding line, weld line in Figure 2d,e slightly larger due to the higher temperature at a higher (DRX) level of during as seen in Figure 2b,c. This is appears likely due to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization welding energy. The dynamic recrystallization basically happens along the weld line in the weld USW. Similar results were reported in a USWed 5754 Al alloy [33]. The equiaxed grain size along nugget zone because of the higher temperatures caused by the more powerful friction and more the weld line plastic in Figure 2d,e appears slightly larger due to the higher temperature at a higher severe deformation [15,17,32,38,48­50]. The equiaxed grain structure in the bulk metal away level of welding energy. The dynamic recrystallization basically happens along the weld line in to the weld from the bond interface shown in Figure 2d is smaller than that in Figure 2a,c. This is likely due effect of higher that exceed the recrystallization temperature. Similar friction results were nugget the zone because of temperatures the higher temperatures caused by the more powerful and more also reported in an USWed copper alloy [51]. The Several other authors observed formation of away severe plastic deformation [15,17,32,38,48­50]. equiaxed grainalso structure inthe the bulk metal fine grains near the faying surface during USW [15,32,33] and during friction stir welding (FSW) of from the bond interface shown in Figure 2d is smaller than that in Figure 2a,c. This is likely due to aluminum alloys [50,52­56]. With an increasing amount of deformation, the dislocation density the effect of higher temperatures that exceed the recrystallization temperature. Similar results were increases leading to the build-up of internal stored strain energy, which is the driving force for the also reported inof an USWed copper [51].

It is known that with increasing temperature, the yield strength of materials trend, i.e., determines they first increase with increasing welding energy up to 1400 J, and then decrease with decreases, which the density or extent of microbonding through metallurgical adhesion and further increasing energy. It is known that with increasing temperature, the yield strength of mechanical interlocking during USW [32,34,39,47,59]. The temperature and strain rate are relatively materials decreases, which determines the density or extent of microbonding through metallurgical low at lower energy inputs such as 400 J and 800 J (Figure 4). In this stage, the strength of the adhesion and mechanical interlocking during USW [32,34,39,47,59]. The temperature and strain rate USWed are joints is mainly determined by the net microbond area [15,32,34,39,47,59].

It is seen that interfacial failure in between two a welding energy of 800 J and 2000 J, respectively. It is seen that interfacial failure in between two welded sheets occurs at a lower energy of 800 J (Figure 5a), while TTT crack growth appears at a welded sheets occurs at a lower energy of 800 J (Figure 5a), while TTT crack growth appears at a higher energy of 2000 J (Figure 5b). In the mode of interfacial failure, larger deformation appears at higher energy of 2000 J (Figure 5b). In the mode of interfacial failure, larger deformation appears at the nugget edge in comparison with the nugget center (Figure 5a); this corroborates well the plastic the nugget edge in comparison with the nugget center (Figure 5a); this corroborates well the plastic deformation-induced high temperature during USW that occurs at the nugget edge than at the nugget deformation-induced high temperature during USW that occurs at the nugget edge than at the center [15,32,34,38,39,63,64].

It is seen that at lower cyclic load levels, the fatigue life of the presented USWed joints isthe in in agreement with that reported in the literature. At higher cyclic load levels, the fatigue life of agreementUSWed with that reported in the literature. At higher cyclic load levels, theWith fatigue life of the presented joints made with a welding energy of 1400 J is indeed longer. respect to the presented USWed joints madeat with welding energy of 1400of J is indeed longer. respect to the effect of the welding energy, the a higher maximum loads 2­3 kN, the 1400With J samples show a effect of the welding energy, at the higher maximum loads of 2­3 kN, the 1400 J samples show a longer fatigue life compared with the 2000 J samples. This corresponds well to the tensile lap shear longer fatigue life compared with the 2000 J samples. This corresponds well to the tensile lap shear test results shown in Figure 4, where the 1400 J samples have a higher tensile lap shear strength than test 2000 results shown in Figure 4, where the 1400 J samples have a higher tensile lap shear strength than the J samples.

As seen in Figure 7a, the nugget pull-out failure mode is observed at the higher cyclic load levels As (1.5­3.0 kN), while through-thickness crack at growth mode is observed at seen in Figure 7a,the thetransverse nugget pull-out failure mode (TTT) is observed the higher cyclic load levels the lowerkN), cyclic loadthe levels (0.5­1.0 through-thickness kN).

During USW weld concavity, residual stresses, surface conditions, surface protective coating, and zinc inclusions at aweldment) higher energy input, a small notch tip that experiences a higher stress concentration in at the lower cyclic micro-level load level than the higher cyclic load level. During USW at a higher caused the higher and more severe deformation at the notch of two sheets occurs, energyby input, a smalltemperature micro-level notch tip that experiences a higher stress concentration caused by and the stress concentration leads to the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks perpendicular the higher temperature and more severe deformation at the notch of two sheets occurs, and the stress to the loading direction [32,33,42,46,61].

4. Conclusions Ultrasonic spot welding of the Al6022-T43 alloy was conducted at different levels of welding energy, and the microstructure, tensile lap shear strength, and fatigue life were evaluated. The following conclusions can be drawn. (1) An ultra-fine "necklace"-like equiaxed grain structure is observed along the weld line as a result of the occurrence of dynamic crystallization. The equiaxed grain size along the weld line appears slightly larger at a higher level of welding energy due to the higher temperature. High-angle grain boundaries are present in both the base metal and ultrasonic spot welded (USWed) joints, and the misorientation angles of the grain boundaries increase with increasing welding energy. A tensile lap shear strength as high as ~94 MPa is achieved at a welding energy of 1400 J. As the welding energy increases, the tensile lap shear strength, failure energy, and critical stress intensity factor of USWed joints first increase, reach their maximum values, and then decrease. The failure mode in the tensile lap shear tests is observed to be interfacial fracture at the lower energy levels, nugget pull-out at the intermediate optimal energy levels (i.e., 1200­1400 J), and transverse through-thickness (TTT) crack growth at the higher energy levels due to the presence of stress concentration at the nugget edge. While fatigue life of the USWed joints made at the energy levels of 1400 J and 2000 J is equivalent within the experimental scatter at the lower cyclic loads, the joints made at 1400 J exhibit a longer fatigue life at the higher cyclic loading levels. The fatigue fracture mode changes from nugget pull-out to TTT crack growth with decreasing cyclic loading levels for the USWed joints made at 1400 J, while TTT crack growth mode occurs at all cyclic loading levels for the USWed joints made at 2000 J. Fatigue crack is observed to initiate from the nugget edge due to the presence of stress concentration, and propagate along fan-shaped divergent directions with some "river-flow" patterns, exhibiting characteristic fatigue striations perpendicular to the fatigue crack growth direction.
