TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY STUDY OF NET-ZERO ENERGY HOUSE FOR CANADA - CASE STUDY OF TEAM NORTH 2009 US DOE SOLAR DECATHLON COMPETITION

Toktam Saeid Masters of Applied Science Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 2010

Abstract
In October 2009, Team North competed in the US DOE 2009 Solar Decathlon competition. Team North's mission was to design and deliver North House, an energy efficient solarpowered home while training Canada's next generation of leaders in sustainable design. In North House, the PV system on the roof was the primary energy generation, complimented by a custom PV cladding system on the south, east and west facades. A solar assisted heat pump system, including a three-tank heat transfer and storage system, the horizontally mounted evacuated-tube solar thermal collectors on the roof and a variable capacity heat pump met the hot water and space heating demands. A second variable capacity heat pump was utilized for space cooling. The solar thermal system was studied using TRNSYS simulation. For the initial assessments the simulations were run for Baltimore. Then, the analyses were extended to different cities across Canada. In all scenarios the same house was linked to the system. The minimum annual solar fraction of the different cities was 64% and

it rose up to 81 %.
Finally the data measured during the competition were analyzed and compared with the data resulting from the simulation. According to competition measures, during the 10 days of competition in Washington DC, the PV system generated 271.6kWh of electricity and the solar thermal system produced 91.7kWh while the house consumption was 249. 1kWh. result, North House was evidently a net-positive house.

Introduction and Literature Review 1.1 Background

Canadians are fortunate to have diverse sources of energy, but only recently have they come to recognize the additional potential in reducing the energy they waste. Making sure the energy supplies go further yields significant benefits for all Canadians. Energy is required for heat, light, transportation, cooling, and power for equipment. Between 1990 and 2004, the demand in Canada for energy has increased by 23% (NRCan, 20068 ). This increase has mainly been caused by the growth in both population and economic activity. According to studies done by Natural Resources Canada, without significant ongoing improvements in energy efficiency in all end-use sectors, energy use would have increased by 36%, instead of the actual 23% (NRC an, 2007). Population is forecast to increase by 11 % between 2005 and 2020; therefore, this growth is expected to contribute a 20% increase in energy use between these years (NRCan, 2006b). Generally, there are two types of energy use: primary and secondary. Primary energy refers to the energy required to transform one form of energy to another and also the energy used to bring energy supplies to the consumer (NRCan, 2008). Organizations such as the US Department of Energy (DOE) are concerned with national energy numbers, and are typically interested in primary or source energy. In 2005, the total amount of primary energy consumed by Canadians was estimated at 12 369 pJI (NRCan, 2008). Globally, buildings use 30 to 40% of the primary energy (Houvila, 2007). However, this energy is typically generated from biomass in low income countries and it comes mostly from the burning of fossil fuels in middle and high income nations (Houvila, 2007). Secondary energy use is the energy used by fmal consumers in various sectors of the economy (NRCan, 2008). Secondary energy use' encompasses energy required for space heating and cooling in the residential and

lOne petajoule (PJ), which is a million billion (1 Ol~) joules, is equivalent to the energy required by 8900 households (excluding transportation requirements) over one year.

commercial/institutional sectors. Commercially, it comprises energy required to run machinery in the industrial and agricultural sectors. Secondary energy use accounted for 69% of the primary energy use in 2005 (NRC an, 2008). All subsequent references in this chapter to "energy" should be interpreted as secondary energy.
In 2005, total Canadian GHG emissions are estimated to have been 747.5 megatonnes (Mt),
ll

66% of which resulted from secondary energy use (NRCan, 2008). Within the United States, the building sector accounts for approximately 48% of annual GHG emissions, with 36% of the direct energy related GHG emission (Nassen et aI., 2007). Figure 1 shows the distribution of secondary energy use and GHG emissions, by sectors in Canada.

Energy efficiency refers to how effectively energy is used to provide a certain level of service or output. A number of recent studies have addressed the significant potential for energy efficiency improvements in Canada. Although these studies vary in methodology, they share a common goal which leads to energy efficiency improvements. Some of the studies that support this potential are: Â· A 2006 study assessed how consumers would make energy choices. It indicated that energy conservation, efficiency and renewable energy can reduce the growth of the energy demand between 16% and 56% by 2025 (MKJA and Marbek Resource Consultant, 2006). Â· The National Round Table on the Economy and the Environment released a long-term climate change study in 2006 that examined how technologies could reduce emissions. It suggested that energy efficiency could achieve approximately 40% of

GHG emissions inc.!ude carbon dioxide (C0 2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20)

their goal of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, more than any other single source (NRTEE, 2006). Â· A paper in Ontario covering the residential, commercial/institutional and industrial sectors, 2005 to 2025, concluded that electricity saving potentials from energy efficiency would be in the 3% to 13% range (Ontario Energy Association, 2006). Â· A 2002 BC Hydro study focused on technologies that were commercially viable by the year 2005. It demonstrated that electricity demand could be reduced by 11 % to 15% per year for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors by 2016 (BC Hydro, 2002) Energy efficiency is becoming noticeably important to the extent that the G8 1ll countries recently committed to implement national energy efficiency programs and advance international cooperation, notably on efficiency standards, sustainable buildings and improvements in industry (NRCan, 2006a). On the other hand, lack of fmancing, perceptions of risk and lack of access or availability of new technologies and the absence of specific, usable information can be counted as the obstacles of the new market intervention from society's point of view.

1.2

Energy Demand in the Residential Applications

1.2.1 Residential Sector Contribution in Energy Consumption
Over half of the global population is now living in urban settlements in which three quarters of global resources are consumed (Robinson et aI., 2009). Energy derived from fossil fuels is dominant among the resources; therefore, it is important that proposed settlements are designed to minimize their net energy consumption. The residential sector within the United States consumes approximately 20-25% of the primary energy, meaning that households account for about 50% of the C02 emission within the U.S. building sector (Greening et aI., 2001; Abrahamse et aI., 2007; Stein and Meier, 2000). In Canada, residential sector contributes approximately 80 megatons of GHGs to the environment yearly (Syed et aI., 2008).

The mix of energy used in the residt.ntial sector ':1 as changed over the period. Specifically, natural gas and electricity have become more dominant than oil. These increases resulted mainly from increased availability of natural gas and lower natural gas prices relu.tive to oii (NRCan, 2008). There are also other factors that affect residential energy demand. Figure 2 sh.o ws some of these choices such as, the spacious living space, the aging population that tends to remain in their homes longer and using more devices that consume energy.

Figur,Â· 2: Residential energy indicators, 1990 and 2005 (NRCao, 2008)

The average unit energy use of all major household appliances decreased every year. However, the increased number ofrninor appliances offsets the benefits of the energy efficiency gains of major appliances (NRCan, 2008). Energy efficiency of existing buildings and houses could be Improved by incorporating the new technologies. For example, existing houses could be retrofitted with highly efficient mechanical equipments, windows, doors and lighting. Where feasible, buildings and houses would :llso use renewable energy technologies, Ulcorporate on-site, off-site generation and be interconnected with other buildings and houses within the community.

1.2.2 The Need for Sustain ability
The number of high efficiency new homes in Canada increased in the period from 2002 to 2006. New buildings and houses incorporated the most energy efficient insulation and air tightness systems; windows and doors; new buildings system integration through 4

commissioning; lighting and dayUghting technologies; heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, and high performance metering, monitoring and control systems. One study done in Warsaw. Poland indicated that the amount of energy use for heating purposes can be characterized by an index for seasonal heating demand. This index described the heat needed to heat 1 m2 of heated area during a standard heating season as Es [kWh!m2a] (Wojdyga, 2009). Buildings built in the years 1979-88 in Poland were characterized by the value of an index for seasonal demand at a level of 340 kWhlm2a, in comparison with lowenergy buildings whose demand for heat reaches a level of 30-40 kWhlm2a, and occasionally 10--15 kWh! m2a, in the case of passive houses (Wojdyga, 2009). A net zero-energy building (NZEB) is a residential or commercial building with greatly reduced energy needs through efficiency gains such that the balance of energy needs can be supplied with renewable energy technologies (Torecellin et at, 2006). The NZEB deftnition emphasizes both demand-side and supply strategies. This can be done by the combination of applicable efficiency measures and renewable energy supply options (Torecellini et at, 2006). There are several options that can be considered in order to achieve this goal, for example, Â· Reduce site energy use through low-energy building technologies by daylighting, high-efficiency HVAC equipment, natural ventilation, evaporative cooling, etc; Â· Use renewable energy sources available at the site like photovoltaic(PV), solar hot water, low-impact hydro, and wind located on-site; Â· Use renewable energy sources available off site to generate energy on site; like biomass, wood pellets, ethanol, or biodiesel that can be imported from off site; Â· Purchase off-site renewable energy sources utility-based wind, PV or other "green" purchasing options. Biofuels such as waste vegetable oil from waste streams and methane from human and animal wastes can also be valuable energy sources. Fuel cells and micro-turbines do not generate energy; rather they typically transform purchased fossil fuels into heat and electricity (Torecellini et aI., 2006). One of the disadvantages with these central resources is that they require infrastructure to move the energy to the building, which is not always available.

Due to the increase in GHG emissions in recent decades, a concern has risen over the climatic changes across the globe. In order to address such concerns, an international treaty has been set forth, known as the Kyoto Protocol
IV

(IPCC, 1997). The mission of this treaty is the

stabilization ofGHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a certain level. To meet this target, Canada promised to reduce its GHG emissions by utilizing renewable energy technology, thus avoiding expensive investments in large central power stations and in transmission and distribution systems (Syed et aI., 2008). By the year 2030, Canadian communities should meet energy demand through the integration of energy systems, making the best use of local on-site renewable sources interconnected with the public energy distribution systems (NRCan, 2006a). Increasing the energy efficiency levels of regulated equipment, and eliminating the least efficient models through performance-based regulations, could also contribute to overall energy efficiency improvements within the building and housing stock.

Sustain ability

1.3.1 Definition of Sustainable Development
Sustainable development is dermed as "development that meets the need of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Commissionv, 1987). The concept of sustainable development has gained popularity in recent years. It was originally introduced as a microeconomic concept in forestry, meaning a strategy aimed at providing wood continually without denuding the forest (Renn et aI., 2009). In recent years, the concept of sustainability has been evolved. It includes economic development, ecological stability and compatibility with social goals and values (Renn et aI., 2009). Inviting the public to be part of the decision making process for derming the targets of sustainable development and facilitating the implementation of sustainable policies has been a major objective in most environmental policy circles.

The concept has been widely applied to governmental economic planning. For the Wuhan, China, government, the strategic thinking such as energy saving and sustainability was gradually reflected, as a result of employment of the Ecological Footprint (EF). As a result, the government increased technology investment, actively developed new resources and improved utilization of available resources and productivity (Wu and Liang, 2009). There is a growing consensus that social and economic sustainability depends on limited natural capital. Therefore, not only is the acceptance of the concept of sustainability and taking the idea into the actions a serious concern, but also developing a concept of sustainability that can accomplish the right balance between preservation and change is a big challenge. Energy and energy efficiency are significantly related to sustainable development (Rosen, 2002). One of the important factors for accomplishing sustainable development is the requirement of energy sources that are fully sustainable. Society needs to utilize the energy resources such that the development results in the minimal negative environmental, health and societal impacts while preserving the life cycle of the resources. Moreover, reduction of environmental impacts can be achieved through increased energy utilization efficiency, for example cogenerating electricity and heat rather that generating them separately (Rosen, 2002). The term 'sustainable development' is a combination of two words and unites three aspectseconomic progress, avoiding environmental damages and sustaining a peaceful society - in one vision (Renn et aI., 2009). However, whether the combination of ecological stability, economic development and social compatibility can simultaneously be accomplished is still unclear.

1.3.2 Renewable Energy
There are various supply renewable energy technologies that are available for zero energy building. Technologies available today include photovoltaic (Py), solar hot water, wind, hydroelectric, and biofuels. All these renewable sources are preferable over conventional energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. In Toronto, Canada, it is proposed that 120 megawatts of electricity be generated in the City from renewable energy sources by 2012 and up to alOOO megawatts by 2050 (Toronto's Sustainable Energy Strategy, 2009).

7

1.3.2.1 Wind Energy
Among other renewable alternatives, wind has a significant potential, and wind fanus have become common all over the world due to its clean and renewable nature. In 2001, Denmark generated 2000 MW of electricity from more than 7,500 wind turbines (Sabin, 2004) . In 2002, Germany produced 3300 MW, while the United Kingdom intended to increase its wind energy capacity to 6000 MW by 2010 (CanWEA, 2003). Canada had a wind-generated electricity capacity of 311 MW resulting in contributing to around 0.5% of electricity production by the end of 2003. This trend helped Canada to reach over 1000 MW in 2006, and the Canadian provinces are targeting over 9000 MW wind-generated electricity by the end of2015 VI( (NRCan, 2007). According to the Canadian Wind Energy Association, Canada has a wind energy potential of 28000 MW, which could provide 20% to 25% of Canada's electricity demand (CanWEA, 2003). Micro wind turbines offer an alternative energy source to the countries which are moving towards reducing energy consumption and GHG emission. Hence, they offer a good environmental benefits and cost economics. They are suitable for the residential application due to their small size, reliable power output and their compatible and robust structure (Syed et al., 2008).

1.3.2.2 Solar Energy
Solar energy has earned a considerable worldwide potential among all renewable energy technologies due to its accessibility. Direct solar energy, such as Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) or Photovoltaic (PV), has an enormous potential in the path of sustainability. Currently solar energy technology is available in the form of low temperature heat (non-concentrating collectors), high-temperature heat (CSP) and direct electricity (PV). Looking at the advantage of the building integration of renewable technologies, more and more countries have set targets for using photovoltaic systems in the building sector. Rooftop installations in Japan (more than 70,000), USA (1,000,000), and Europe (1,000,000) indicate the worldwide increase in attention to Building-Integrated PV (BIPV) systems. The European

Commission (EC) had a target of increasing the PV electricity production to 2000 MW by
2010 in comparison to 52 and 200 MW in 1995 and 1999, respectively (Ayoub et aI., 2000;

Bakos et at, 2003). A solar thermal power plant in a region with abundant sunshine can reach a continuous production 0[30 MW/k.m2, whereas the maximum yield that can be obtained from biomass is 2 MW/k.m2, and from wind parks is 1.5 MW/k.m2 (Voorthuysen, 2009). Each kilowatt of photovoltaic micro power can potentially offset 1.58 tons of CO2/year when replacing coal use, 1.30 tons of C02/year when replacing oil use, and 0.73 tons of CO2/year when replacing natural gas use (Ayoub et aI., 2000). The problem that needs to be addressed with solar systems is that they would deliver a surplus of electricity in the summer and have a deficit in the winter. This seasonal and day-evening variation problem can be effectively resolved if the electrical utility allows net-metering. In net-metering, a system owner receives retail credit for at least a portion of the electricity he/she generates. In study done in Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates as the operation sites (Lecoufle et aI.,
2009). the annual electrical output of each of the different options was simulated for the PV

and CSP options. Global Irradiation (GRI) and Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) were considered as the used solar resources for the case ofPV and CSP respectively. Considering light slope terrain for both scenarios, more than 2,000 full load hours was achieved by the PV plant using tracking systems. For the CSP technology with storage, the power generation reached more than 3,000 full load hours per year. Although it is known that the performance of PV modules goes down in hot climates, the results are still relatively high (Lecoufle et aI.,
2009).

If a desert area equal to the size of France is covered with solar panels or solar thermal power plants, both having an efficiency of 15%, the whole current global consumption of oil, coal, gas and uranium can be replaced (Voorthuysen, 2009). All Canadian capitals compare favorably with the major cities in Germany (Berlin) and Japan (Tokyo), two world-leading countries in terms ofPV installed capacity (Pelland et al., 2006). Figure 3 shows the promising solar energy potential of Canada as given in PV maps obtained from NRCan's website.

Considering the fact that the global electricity consumption in 2003 was 1,686 GWavcragc (Voorthuysen, 2006), if humanity decides to make an approach towards the Solar Age, a widely supported action should be taken. In order to do so, hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of solar fields must be built, complete with power stations, thermal storage tanks and solar fuel factories.

1.3.2.2.1

S olar Heating System

Technologies such as solar hot water systems and solar space heating with larger solar collector areas and storage units for enlarged solar fractions have been utilized more than before. However, solar heating systems still suffer from a necessity for an additional heat source, in most cases based on fossil fuels. The problem is caused by the gap between solar radiation availability driven from day/night and summer/winter shift and thermal energy requirement (Trinkl et aI. , 2009). Using a combination of conventional and renewable energy such as combined heat and power systems and solar photovoltaic technology can enhance the energy performance of new

buildings and houses. One study (Nurzia et al., 2008), presented a solar heating and cooling plant in an office building for a typical northern Italian town (Alpine climate) and a typical southern Italian town (Mediterranean climate), indicated that the deployment of combined solar heating and cooling system is a feasible solution in all countries where high solar irradiation matches high cooling loads in buildings. The system layout was considered as follows: in warm months the cooling demand was satisfied by an absorption chiller driven by a solar collector field and a reversible heat pump operating in series. A hot storage matches the variability of solar radiation, while a cold storage smoothes the non-stationary demand of cooling. During winter, the reversible compression heat pump operates for space heating. The Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the heat pump was improved by utilizing the solar collectors as a thermal source at the evaporator of the heat pump (Nurzia et al., 2008). As both solar heating and heat pumps are innovative technologies for sustaining ecological heat generation, their combination has been subjected to research continuously. Fundamental research regarding the combination of a heat pump and solar collectors was conducted in a simulation (Freeman and Mitchell, 1979). The development of a solar heat pump system with latent heat storage was another innovation (Comakli et al., 1993). The possibility of waterlice phase change storage into such system for industrial applications led to promising results (Trinkl et al., 2004). The annual simulation results of the solar heating system offered promising prospects for further applications of both the heat pump and the solar thermal system in Central Europe (Trinkl et al., 2009). The proposed solarlheat pump heating system was also found to be more suitable for buildings because of acceptable space demand, as well as the reduction of electric energy demand for the heat pump by managing the source and sink. temperatures. However, for the solar system to be more efficient, some integrated storage with high energy density and high energy capacity is required. Water is a very good medium in the heating applications since a good stratification can be maintain in the storage (Cabezaet al., 2006). By utilizing conventional hot water storage with a 30Â°C temperature difference, it is possible to store approximately 30 kWhthennal/m3 of storage (Martin and Setterwall, 2009). A similar study indicated that by an appropriate design of thermal energy storage using phase change material technology (PCM) it is possible to triple the capacity to over 90 kWhthermal 1m3 (Martin and Setterwall, 2009).

Introduction to Building Simulation Tool (TRNSYS)

1.4.1 TRNSYS Evaluation as a Simulation Tool
Building energy software tools arose in the 1970s, followed by refmement within the professional realm in the 1980s, and expansion of scope, scale, and diverse user applicability in the 1990s (Mills, 2004 ). Today, the U.S. Department of Energy lists 342 tools on their Web directory (DOE, 2008). Building energy simulation programs ideally model all aspects of a building that influence energy use and thermal and visual comfort for the occupants. Integrated energy performance simulation tools usually model the transient response of the building structure, through transfer functions or a fmite difference method. The simulation packages require standardized codes to insure that a proposed building simulation will meet a minimum performance guideline. A number of standards and guidelines have been developed in an effort to assist end users in choosing an appropriate tool. ANSIIASHRAE Standard 140 (ASHRAE, 2005) is one of those standards assisting simulators in assessing tool capabilities and helping software developers in verifying their work. A number of studies done in applying ASHRAE Standard 140 to TRNSYS indicated the reliability and validity of the results obtained from TRNSYS simulation. It was identified that there is a great deal of leeway within a given software package to make widely varying assumptions and yet still fall well within the range of acceptability (Bradley et aI., 2004) Given such sensitivities, it might be concluded that it would be difficult to obtain a consistent set of assumptions that would cause a software package to pass the entire ASHRAE test. However, TRNSYS did acceptably pass all the tests using the conformed assumption set defmed by the ASHRAE test (McDowell et aI., 2004)

1.4.2 Introduction to TRNSYS
TRNSYS consists of a suite of programs: The TRNSYS simulation Studio, the simulation engine (TRNDll.dll) and its executable file (TRNExe.exe), the Building input data visual interface (TRNBuild.exe), and the Editor used to create stand-alone redistributable programs known as TRNSED applications (TRNEdit.exe) (SEL, 2004). A TRNSYS project is typically set up by connecting components graphically in the Simulation Studio. The user can create projects by drag-and-dropping components to the workspace, connecting them together by linking the outputs of one component to the inputs of another component and fmally set the 12

global simulation parameters. The user can check a component's configuration and the link between two components. The simulation can be executed once all the necessary components are placed on the assembly panel, the parameters and initial values are defmed for each component and the necessary links between components are made and the internal connections from. Once they are completed the results can be viewed and printed using an online plotter. Based on the results, adjustments can be made to the components in the proj ect in the Assembly Panel and more simulations can be run. All the information required simulating the building is described in a special window called TRNBuild. TRNBuild is the tool used to enter input data for modeling multi-zone buildings. The user can also edit the building description through the simulation studio by selecting "Edit Building" icon. It allows user to specifY all the building structure details, as well as everything that is needed to simulate the thermal behavior of the building, such as windows optical properties, heating and cooling schedules, etc.

it

When performing building energy simulations, it is important to keep in mind that there are many considerations that can significantly affect the output. Getting results that approach reality is a difficult task, even if various systems, constructions and geometry are accurately accounted for. Occupancy behaviour can throw off any assumed results by 50% or more. Hence, the intent is to use the software to assess the relative impact on design decisions, before tackling a rigorous simulation aimed at predicting realistic values of annual energy use. 13

1.5 Introduction to North House and the Solar Decathlon Competition
1.5.1 Solar Decathlon Competition
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have established the Solar Decathlon as an international competition to increase awareness about solar-powered homes and demonstrate that a well designed house can generate enough electricity to meet the needs of a household.

1.5.1.1 The 2007 Solar Decathlon Participants and their Designs
Twenty student teams from universities in the US, Puerto Rico, Germany, Canada and Spain participated in the third Solar Decathlon held on 2007. The student teams assembled real-life, 800

rr super-efficient solar homes (Johnson, 2007).

Georgia Tech was one of teams that participated in the Solar Decathlon 2007 competition. An estimation of the expected household energy consumption was fundamental for the design of the photovoltaic system. For the preliminary analyses, the team generated a typical average and peak. daily electric demand profile which then was translated into the total PV supply for the house. The analysis tool and simulation they used included: EnergyPlus for the thermal system assessment, RETScreen with EnergyPlus for the mechanical system selection, and steady state heat approximation for exploring options to reduce heating and cooling load, electric demand and wattage profile of the actual appliances and loads (Choudhary et al., 2008 ). ElementHouse, the University of Illinois's entry, utilized EnergyPlus to provide accurate estimations on power use and generation. Coupling EnergyPlus with daylighting simulation performed with Radiance, assisted the team to fmalize the building envelope which embraced the passive and low energy ideas to minimize the annual heating and cooling loads (Wang et aI., 2009). The University of Illinois's house was the only entry that featured an all-electric design. No solar thermal collectors were used; space and water heating was accomplished primarily through heat pumps. The house module was sensibly conditioned with autonomous, custom mini-split heat pumps using all radiant and natural convection heat exchange for the interior side (Bames et al., 2009).

The Santa Clara University (SCU) team designed a solar house with the goai of being highly sustainable by using streamlined technologies, providing as much power as needed, and by minimizing the energy usage within the building. The energy and thermal loads were modeled using EnergyPlus. The thermal energy design decisions for their house were based largely un a combination of the solar decathlon contest requirements and technologies that were sustainable anC commercially available (Elizondo, Lebassi, & Gonzalez-Cruz, 2009). The University of Texas house was called the BLOOMHouse. The team developed a prefabricated 6.6 kW stand-alone solar-powered modular house that could be adapted to a specific site and modified for the needs of a different site within a different climatIc zone, and client context. The house was designed to meet the target of $0. 1OIkWh for power
ill

the year

2015, and to introduce the ideas of how to integrate renewable energy technologies into residential buildings (Garrison, 2008). Current community development programs in the United States and other cOill1tries consist primarily of planning and zoning regulations that focus on economic and population growtr The Pennsylvania State University entry focused on a building-centred community development process. The design and construction of two prototype homes for two different communities were then presented as case studies for the competition (Floras Phelps et al. , 2007).

1.5.1.2 The US 2009 Solar Decathlon Competition
In 2009 Solar Decathlon, 20 college and university teams from around the world deSIgned,

built and operated their versions of the most attractive, effective , and energy-efficient solarpowered home The 2009 Solar Decathlon competition consisted of lO contests that centered on the ways in which energy is used in people's daily lives. During the competition the teams receIved points for their performance in ten contests and opened their homes to the public.

In October 2009, Team North, a consortium of Ryerson University, University of Waterloo

and Simon. Fraser University competed in the 2009 Solar Decathlon. Team North's mission was to design and deliver a home called "North House", a compelling and marketable solarpowered home while training Canada's next generation of leaders in sustainable design . The combination of al-tive and passive solar design, integrated energy production, customized component, and mob,le interactive technologies is a powerful vehicle of advancement in Canadian new housing industry, as wet as improvement in the health and well-being of Canadian residents.

1.5.1.3.1

Team-Based Operative Strategies

Given the complexity of the task and the number of parallel activities and feedback loops that need to be occurring simultaneously, a typical hierarchical project structure would simply not work. In order to navigate through tbe intensive activities of design, energy modeling, envelope design, product testing, proto typing, component development, business modeling, life cycle costing, materials acquisition, fundraising, document production, construction, transportation and shipping, installation, balancing, and monitoring that will comprise the project, several layers of organization had been created that were task specific and tried to recognize the synergies between teams (North House Project Manual, June 2, 2009). The organizational diagram illustrated in Figure 7 shows the operations and interactions within our student-faculty team.
16

Figure 7: Team North organization diagram

The teams were not divided according to discipline but according to the various activities that need to be undertaken and involved individuals [rom different disciplines. Representatives from mdustry partners were invited to join the discussions. Team North considered building manufacturers and suppliers not as contractors but as design collaborators, and encouraged the possibility of the design research to develop new products in collaboranon with industry.

1.5.2 North House
North House is more than green, developing a new and innovative green housing model that makes sustainable living attractive and rewarding. Energy efficiency is only half of the sustainable living equation. North House goes beyond carbon counting to help support daily living j)attems and energy use routines. The design approach is based on three strategies: A House for Climate Extremes, Holistic Solar Living and DReSS (Distributed Responsive System of Skins). Following descriptIOns are obtained from the North House project manual.

Figure 8: North House

17

1.5.2.1 A House for Climate Extremes
North House was designed with a highly insulated, efficient, passively and mechanically conditioned interior that was wrapped by a layered envelope that modulated the house's response to various climates, solar and shading conditions. The footprint of the house was compact and efficient, minimizing envelope surface area and maximizing opportunities for east-west passive ventilation. The interior consisted of a dense pack of service on the north side of the house, opening to a generous and flexible living space. The flexible living space accommodated sleeping, eating and living functions with custom reconfigurable furniture that maximized openness and multi-functionality. This flexible framework allowed North House to be customized for different living needs, to be adapted to multiple regions across the country and to take advantage of new technologies and developments in envelope and solar technologies. The modular design of North House also allowed the building to be easily divided into component modules for fabrication, transportation, assembly and future expansion to accommodate a variety of familial situations.

1.5.2.2 Holistic Solar Living
The team defined Holistic Solar Living as an approach to making and living that incorporates the energy and benefits of the sun in all ways possible. The consideration of daylighting, passive systems, microclimate generation, maintenance, food production, solar phase change materials, and solar responsiveness is essential to this perspective. Strategies deployed included a responsive system of louvers that wrapped the entire house in a luminous array, alternatively shading and allowing panoramic views of the landscape, locating the bed on the east side of the house to witness the sunrise, and having the kitchen, dining and outdoor eating on the west side to enjoy afternoon and sunset light. Holistic Solar Living also includes using the sun's energy to grow vegetable and herbs in the garden and along the south facing windows and drying and canning to preserve food to limit refrigeration.

1.5.2.3 DReSS (Distributed Responsive System of Skins)
The North House was structured and constructed in layers. The exterior layers of the house comprised a 'thick' Responsive Envelope that physically mediated energy production, environmental conditions, and the personal comfort preferences of the occupants. It was composed of flexible layers integrated with PVs to generate solar energy. The layers provided 18

passive solar gain when necessary, shading at other times, opened to the exterior when views were desired, and were capable of mitigating extreme climatic shifts by closing down when the house was in conditioned mode or opening up to allow the house to breathe during the temperate seasons. The house incorporated incremental, simple, adaptable, distributed systems throughout to achieve its energy, living, and sustainable goals. 1.5.2.4 Adaptive Living Interface System The Adaptive Living Interface System (ALIS), developed especially for North House, was comprised of interactive technologies combined with ambient and haptic information cues, which helped the residential occupant both to control the systems of the house, and provide feedback on the operation of the house, in this way supporting behavioural transformation towards energy saving living patterns. The ALIS was moving beyond automated controls to directly address the needs of residential occupants by providing an easy-to-use ubiquitous interface, supporting residential tasks, integrated with the user's lifestyle and providing meaningful performance feedback. Three types of user interface components comprised the ALIS. First, a standard web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection was developed. This GUI included traditional application-style tools which provided an overview of building state and performance and which supplied alerts according to user-specified events. Furthermore, the GUI was extended to a set of mobile components for a SmartPhone. A set of small, peripheral, always-on information components were defmed. These components provided a continuous overview of the house, delivered appropriate alerts, and served as a quick navigation button into remote controls. Finally, an ambient and subtle information system was explored. It was integrated into the house itself, and it changed its behaviour, as conditions changed, in ambient and non-intrusive ways. 1.5.2.5 Customizable Components Team North was collaborating with a custom fabricator to optimize shop-built CAD/CAM production techniques and technologies for the North House prototype, to lighten the structure as much as possible in order to facilitate transport, assembly, disassembly and material use. Use of shop-built prefabrication and component assemblies supported efficient transportation, assembly and disassembly on the National Mall in Washington, DC. North 19

House was conceived as a prototype of mass-customization, and demonstrated a given range of systems and technologies. Each system, however, had the capacity to be completely removed and replaced with alternative systems - to allow modification, research, and testing long into the future.

1.6

Significance of Study

Canada has one of the coldest climates in the world. Most parts of the country go through a long winter season. In addition, there is a prevalence of single-family housing across Canada. As a consequence, total end-use energy consumption in Canada is high. In Canada, 78% of all residential energy use is for space heating and water heating (NRCan, 2008). In order to avoid utilizing conventional energy sources, renewable energy technologies that are available for zero energy buildings need to be developed. There are various renewable energy technologies. Technologies available today include photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, wind, hydroelectric, and biofuels. PV systems provide a clean, sustainable, and environmentally friendly source of energy. It has been estimated that if a 30m2 PV array were to be installed on the roof of an average Canadian house, it would supply approximately 4000 kWh annually, approximately 45% of the house electrical consumption (Ayoub et al., 2000). Using NZEB design goals gives us the opportunity of designing more than a low-energy building with an energy savings goal and takes us into the realm of a sustainable energy endpoint. North House is a simple yet innovative solar powered house that produced more energy than it consumed. The solar heating system provided 100% of the heating and hot water needs even when available solar energy was reduced.

1.7

Objectives of the Thesis

The overall objective of this thesis is to investigate the energy performance of North House.

In order to do that, the energy balance of the house utilizing new renewable and energy
efficient technologies was studied using TRNSYS simulation. Finally the data obtained from the simulation were compared to real time data obtained from ten days of competition to test the performance of the system. To reach these objectives the following case studies were conducted: 1. Different HVAC designs; 20

2. Each system, including the solar heating system, cooling pond and exterior shading was modeled in TRNSYS independently to study their performances individually; 3. The final overall design was simulated in TRNSYS and the results were compared to real time data; 4. The system performance was studied for five Canadian cities.

1.8

Scope of the Study

This study is limited by a simple control system modeled in TRNSYS. The actual North House HVAC control was a complex control system that needs to be programmed in order to use in TRNSYS. The PCM material was not integrated in the TRNSYS model. In TRNSYS weather library the closest location to Washington DC is Baltimore. In reality, they are slightly different in terms of the ambient temperature and the solar radiation. Therefore, when comparing the data collected during the competition and the simulation data, this consideration needs to taken into account.

North House Building Simulation 2.1 North House Building Description

The North House engineering design focused on delivering a low-energy and highly efficient net-energy-positive solar building that was capable of adapting to the various climates of Canada. To achieve this, North House optimized the use of the sun by using passive solar design principles to minimize energy consumption, while deploying distributed buildingintegrated photovoltaic and solar-thennal technology to maximize energy production. This was complemented by an integrated smart control system, which sought out the optimal low energy approach to operate the home and still maintain a high degree of occupant comfort. To achieve this goal, numerous technical challenges were met in the design and construction of North House that, in some cases, defied conventional norms of residential design. Areas of notable technical innovation were as follows ( North House Project Manual, June 2, 2009) VITI: Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· Building Orientation and Fonn Passive and Active Building Envelope Domestic Hot Water and HVAC System Distributed Photovoltaic System Integrated Smart Control System

Most of the engineering work had been evaluated through a series of computer models, including overall annual building energy simulations, window heat transfer simulations, PV power production simulations, and HVAC systems integration simulations. These simulations had been made part of the iterative integrated design process intended to optimize and refme all of the components of the house. Results from the simulations gave the team valuable insight regarding the perfonnance of the design, which was considered in conjunction with other design requirements before any decisions were made.

vm Note from the author: The information provided in Chapter 2 is obtained from North House Project Manual, submitted to DOE on June 2, 2009. Since this thesis will be using as a future reference, essential information on the house required to be included.

2.1.1 Building Orientation and Form
Contrary to most solar homes orientated with a longer facrade along the east-west axis to maximize solar exposure to the south, North House took on a compact form. The surface area to internal volume ratio was reduced resulting in less solar exposure. The beneficial trade-off was the reduction of the amount of energy to heat and cool. While this reduced the solar exposure of the home to the south, the reduction in Southern exposure was compensated for by installing a full-height floor-to-ceiling glazing wall system on the South, East, and West facrades to maximize solar gain.

2.1.2 Passive and Active Building Envelope
The building envelope had a significant role in the overall passive solar design strategy of North House by carefully controlling energy and mass flows between the exterior and interior of the house. North House featured both active solar technologies and passive technologies.

23

2.1.2.1

Passive Technologies Walls Description

2.1.2.1.1

One of the significant energy loads in a typical Canadian home is space heating. The most effective way to reduce heating load is to have a highly insulated and air-tight building envelope to minimize heat transfer. The opaque walls were constructed out of 2x6 wood sandwich panels insulated with 5.5" of closed-celled Soy-Lock polyurathane spray foam insulation, with an additional 3.5" of spray foam outboard of the sandwich panel in between the offsetting 2x4 wood studs. The exterior layer of spray foam minimized thermal bridging from the studs. Nominal R-values are typically reported, however, they are not representative of the actual heat transfer across the wall, since the short-circuiting thermal bridges from the studs are not accounted for. The wall system had a nominal R-value ofR-64, and an actual R-value ofR47 with studs. The floor had a little less insulation, with a nominal R-value ofR-51 and R-36 with joists, since it did not have any insulation outside of the sandwich panel. This was due to the fact that the permanent installation of the home will have an insulated foundation. The walls in North House were more than three times more insulating than the walls ofa typical Canadian home.

2.1.2.1.2

Phase Change Material (PCM)

Phase change materials (PCM) embedded underneath the finished floor helped to effectively utilize the solar gains by storing the free heat during the day and releasing it at night. Although PCMs are typically placed above suspended ceilings, PCMs in North House were placed underneath the floor to effectively collect the solar radiation that shines down from the sun through the highly glazed fa~ades. The PCMs consisted of a salt-hydrate solution which changed phase at 24Â°C. Due to the large amount of latent heat, the application of PCMs can reduce the conventional thermal mass. PCMs helped stabilize daily temperature fluctuations of the home and reduced peak space heating and cooling loads and allowed for HVAC sizing to be reduced leading to significant savings in HVAC design.

2.1.2.1.3

Windows Description

As part ofthe highly insulated building envelope, North House used some of the most insulating high performance windows available in the industry. A highly glazed fa~ade on the 24

east-, west-, and south-face covered the main living space of the home. In total North House had a window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of approximately 70% yet still was a net-positive home. The fa9ades of North House were constructed with a highly insulated quad-layered krypton filled glazing unit (lGUs) which was able to harness passive solar heat from the sun with its relatively low U-value of 0.474 W/m2K (R-12) yet relatively high SHGC of 0.404. The quad glazed configuration featured two sheets of glass sandwiching two layers of plastic films which had selective low-e coatings. Placing the low-e coatings in this configuration limited the amount of long-wave thermal radiation transmission from indoors to outdoors while still allowing significant amounts of solar gain through the glazing. Figure 10 illustrates different layers of the quad-layered window unit. Despite specifying a high-performance glazing unit, most of the desired performance may be lost through a poorly designed frame. These IGUs were combined with highly insulated wood mullions and innovative warm-edge spacers to ensure a high level of thermal insulation through the window assembly. The result of the investigation was the production of a high-performance curtain wall system that was approximately four times more insulating than a typical aluminum curtain wall.

Shading (External Blinds)

One significant problem with buildings with highly glazed fa9ades is overheating due to excessive solar gains. This problem was overcome by the use of dynamic shading through the form of exterior venetian blinds (Figure 11). The exterior venetian blinds were able to block unwanted solar gains which helped to significantly reduce the cooling load of the home. The control of the dynamic shading system was innovatively coupled with the home's 25

HVAC control system to maintain a high level ofthennal comfort while using minimal energy. The central home automation set the modes of the blinds and automatically detennined the angle of the sun from the time of the day. The exterior venetian blinds had four modes of automated operation: open, gain, block, and closed. Using location, orientation, time of day, and time of year the blind controllers were continuously aware of the location of the sun. Gain and block modes oriented the slats parallel and perpendicular to the sun's rays respectively. Transitions between modes were coordinated based on the interior temperature of the house. When the heating system was activated, the blinds were open, allowing maximum heat gain. When the cooling system was activated, the blinds blocked the direct rays of the sun. In the deadband between heating and cooling temperature set points the blinds attempted to maintain temperature by alternating between block and gain modes. In the event of overheating, the blinds were closed completely. Under low light conditions or high wind the blinds were retracted. Careful consideration was taken by the design team to avoid unwanted cyclic behaviour of the blinds when the HV AC system was running and to ensure that the PCMs were fully charged before the transition to blocking mode; thus, all systems worked together to provide a high level of thermal comfort whjle using a minimum amount of energy. The exterior blinds were not only part of the thennal management system of the home but were also part of the lighting system, since they allowed varying degrees of daylight.

Active Technologies Solar Thermal and HVA C System

2.1.2.2.1

The mechanical system in North House was designed with the goal of collecting enough solar energy to cover the majority of the domestic hot water and space heating demands throughout the year, while conserving every last watt of electrical power. A comprehensive description and a detailed design are provided in Chapter 4.

2.1.2.2.2

Distributed Photovoltaic System

In order to achieve North House's goal of maximizing power production throughout the year, in a variety of climatic conditions, energy production systems are integrated into virtually every surface of the building envelope. Many different PV array configurations were initiated and studied to evaluate the different design configurations. A detailed design analysis is presented in the following sections.

2.1.2.2.3

Integrated Smart Control System

North House integrated controls system offers many opportunities for technical

innovation. Because the building's integrated control system has to efficiently manage the operation of multiple subsystems and provide feedback to the user regarding the performance of the house, the control system was being custom designed and built. At the heart of the integrated control system was the Central Home Automation Server (CHAS), which managed both the Graphic User Interface (GUI) as well as all subsystems of the house. Depending on internal and external conditions', the CHAS was able to make highlevel decisions to enhance the energy performance of the house. For example, the CHAS determined the operation of the external shading system depending on the internal air temperature of the home, the amount of incoming solar radiation, the exterior wind speeds, and the expected position of the sun. HVAC control, external shade automation, bed actuation, interior and exterior environment, and water consumption monitoring were implemented with the Beckhoff programmable logic controller. Using a human body metaphor, the Beckhoffwas considered the spinal cord of North House. The Beckhoff communicated with the CHAS via an ADS interface over ethernet.

27

Coordination by the CHAS was accomplished over this interface by changing space heating, cooling, and hot water set-points. The solar thermal controller was connected to a data logger which allowed for the CHAS to query the amount of solar thermal energy collected allowing daily feedback. Data were also collected via ADS interface in a database for historical analysis for the occupants.

2.2

Energy Modeling Summary

Energy and mass flows in buildings are inherently dynamic and complex. Any attempt to capture the interactions between various building elements (such as envelope, energy systems, occupants, appliances, etc.) requires sophisticated modeling techniques. Even when a sophisticated, integrated model is available, the predictions rely heavily on occupant behaviour. From the onset of the North House project, computer simulations were used to assess the performance of the building and its components. The TRNSYS simulation was used to assess the energy performance of the house.

2.2.1 House Energy Balance
The total energy balance of the North House was based on the performance analyses of the active and passive energy systems incorporated into its design. Tables 1 and 2 summarize how each house component was modeled.
Table 1: Summary oBhe North House energy consumptions

Consumption Space Heating Annual idealized demand profile was predicted by TRNSYS. Based on these results, an average demand value was calculated for each month and applied to the model. Space Cooling DHW Appliances and Plug Loads Annual idealized demand profile was predicted by TRNSYS. The system was modeled in TRNSYS and was coupled to the solar thermal system. Energy consumption of appliances was based on product specification, modified where necessary, for expected occupancy use. Where hot water was used, the values account for water heating energy but did not reflect the DHW system conversion efficiency. Plug loads were based on anticipated usage schedules and average power draws. lighting lighting consumption was estimated based on the wattage of

28

I the lighting components and an occupancy schedule.
Table 2: Summary of the North House energy productions

Production PV Electrical production was modeled in TRNSYS and NREL's PVWatts calculator using the selected PV modulus and representative areas of the east, west, south fa~ade and roof over one year period for Toronto. The possible accumulation of snow was neglected. Inverter efficiencies and losses were neglected. Solar Thermal This system was modeled in TRNSYS in combination with the DHW model. The reported value was the useful collected heat, some of which would be lost in dissipaters when demand was insufficient to take advantage of the collected heat (Chapter 4). The solar thermal system was designed to operate with a large thermal storage system once the house is situated in its permanent location.

2.2.2 Detailed House Model in TRNSYS
Building energy analysis was perfonned using TRNSYS. The models focused mainly on predicting annual space heating and cooling energy, beginning with a very simple model and progressively adding building elements representative of the North House design. Emphasis was placed on establishing the relevant model inputs to reduce the house energy demand. The results indicated that the demand for space heating and cooling can be decreased drastically primarily by providing appropriate solar protection and thennal mass. Table 3 summarizes the model inputs. The building geometry and construction were based on the drawing set.

The energy consumption of the major appliances utilized in the North House and the SUI House projects are compared to a typical home's appliances assumed by CMHC standards (NRCan, 2005). The results are provided in Tables 1 and 2 in Appendix A. The energy consumption by appliances, excluding the miscellaneous appliances, was reduced by 57% and 45% for the case of the North House and the SUI house respectively.
2.2.2.2 Schedules

Internal gain and ventilation schedules were created to approximate the occupancy of the house. Different internal gain schedules were constructed for weekdays and weekends to account for appliance use such as clothes washer, clothes dryer and oven. The ventilation

schedule included, in addition to the minimum ventilation requirements, a bathroom exhaust fan and a range hood fan that provided additional ventilation during certain hours in the day. 2.2.2.3 Lighting Design The general strategy for the artificial lighting of North House was to achieve maximum integration with the architecture so that the lighting fixtures become invisible when not in use. North House as designed so that little or no artificial lighting is required during daylight hours: the ample glass on the three perimeter walls of the living space, combined with the dynamic shading system allowed for ample day-lighting; the window at the shower on the north side provided ambient light in the densepack service zone. Artificial lighting was used to complement daylight when necessary and used a combination of energy efficient fluorescent and LED lighting to maximize amenity, comfort, and appropriate colour rendering and minimize energy use. The main living space provided a combination of ambient and task lighting. Ambient lighting was provided by a flexible framework of fluorescent lights located behind a custom-designed diffusing soffit, allowing for easy reconfiguration and response to the variable interior arrangements. Specific task lights dropped below the soffit to illuminate work surfaces; the kitchen counter, for example, was illuminated by a combination of pendant LED task lights which hung below the soffit and LED lighting integrated behind translucent Corian panels installed along the length of the counter. A custom sculptural diffuser was suspended from the living room ceiling and masked the presence of an array of remote phosphor LED downlights and sensors and included lenses that provided decorative and ambient effects above the dining area. The remote phosphor technology of the living space fixtures had a fixture efficiency of over 50 lumens per watt compared to compact fluorescent efficacies of 36 lumens per watt. Task lighting in the living area was provided by a work lamp that can be stored in the mobile workstation. For bedtime reading, a portable LED reading lamp could be clipped on to the bed's suspension cables, which also carry a low voltage current.

In the densepack service zone, the majority of the electric lighting was provided by T5
fluorescent tubes concealed in continuous coves within the dropped wood ceiling. In the bathroom, a high-eRI linear fluorescent source was integrated seamlessly into bathroom rrnrror. All of the interior lights were controlled with zone controls and user profiles developed 33

through the Central Home Automation Server (CHAS). As a general sustainability strategy, the team tried to minimize the impact of manufacturing by using fewer fixtures, and by buying locally manufactured products. The lighting choices for North House included careful consideration oflife cycle costing and safe disposal. For example, all fluorescent sources use mercury. The Philips T5 lamp selection has the lowest rated level of mercury at l.5gm and with a 40,000 hour plus lamp life this light source could match the life of the home.

2.2.3 Distributed Photovoltaic System
2.2.3.1 Initial Solar Resource Assessment
Many different PV array configurations were studied to evaluate the different design configurations: 1. The first scenario consisted of a horizontal roof covered in photovoltaics and a 5-foot high band at the top of the east, west and south facades. 2. The second case represented a roof covered in photovoltaics but tilted 12 degrees towards the south (maximum tilt to stay within solar envelope) with PV installed on the east and west facades where possible. 3. The third case represented an area, the size of the roof, tracking the sun in two axes. 4. The last scenario was the same as the second case, but for a greater slope of the roof (39 degrees). According to the analysis conducted by engineering team (North House project Manual, June 2, 2009), the largest production would be achieved by utilizing the last option. The third case had the second largest PV production followed by the first scenario. The second had the least electricity generation. On the other hand, the third scenario would be difficult to produce due to the size of the roof, and would not fit within the solar envelope. Also, if the two-axis tracking was constrained within the solar envelope, it was found that there would be no gain in electricity generation compared to a static roof with vertical sides. Moreover, third and fourth cases could not be used during competition because of the competition rules and regulations (Appendix D) but were good for comparison purposes. The concept of a "partial tracking" (repositioning) system as seen in Figure 3 was evaluated. The array in this concept was split in four sections and stayed within the solar envelope at all 34

time. In the morning, the two sections on the west side of the house would tilt towards the east. At around midday, the two sections on the north side would tilt towards the south. Finally, in the evening, the two sections on the east side of the house would tilt west. This was an interesting concept but it was proven by design team, to result in almost the exact same power production as a fixed tilted roof at 11.5 degrees.

Figure 12: Repositioning system

From the analyses, it was found that the single most important variable for PV energy production is the total PV area. Based on these findings, the following PV layout was chosen.
2.2.3.2 Final PV Configuration

Integrating PVs into every surface on the building resulted in using the surface area on the building as an active energy producer. as well as avoiding some of the complexities of solar tracking which plagued many large PV installations in the past, particularly in cold climates. In addition, the precise orientation of the house and its solar exposure would become less of a problem since PV panels were mounted on a large area on the building at different orientations. A large array of typical photovoltaic (PV) panels was located on the flat roof. The rest of North House's electrical power production came from building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) panels located on the south, east, and west fa9ades, which operated when the sun was at a low angle. The combination of both horizontally- and vertically-mounted PV allowed North House to make use of its surface area to collect solar energy without re-orientating itself.

35

2.2.3.3 Simulation models and results
The modeling of the photovoltaics was initially done in TRNSYS by the engineering team. All facade PVs were assumed to be Day 4 Energy 36MC panels. In this configuration, the roof contained 56 panels divided into 4 strings of 14 panels, of which two inverters handled two strings each. The east- and west- facades each contain 13 panels each attached in series. Only one inverter was needed for these two strings as only one side of the house faces the sun at any given time. The south-fayade contained 8 panels in series. The model assumed no losses in the lines or the inverters. These losses should be fairly small (between 5-10%). As shown in table 5, the total PV output for during the competition (10 days) was estimated to be 197 kWh. Table 6 shows the energy production for the competition period. Since Washington, DC weather data is not included in the TRNSYS library, the weather data for Baltimore was used.

These results were modified based on selection of Schuco PV panels. Solar electric power was generated with four arrays: one on the roof (Day4 panels), and one each on the east, south and west facades (Schuco panels) of the building. Five Xantrex inverters were used to convert the DC power into grid quality AC power. The rooftop arrays were the main power producers and the facade arrays allowed for a more even energy production over the course of the day and year. The model was representative of typical output for the city of Toronto, where the house will be permanently located. Solar power generation from each individual inverter was available via the Xantrex display unit. Total power generation and cumulative energy production were monitored with the power logic branch circuit power meter. The Branch Circuit Power Meter (BCPM) allowed for the measurement of power and energy readings for the grid connection, solar feed, and each breaker circuit in the main electrical panel. The data were collected by the ClIAS and logically grouped for feedback to the user and historical analysis. The entire PV array and BIPV was expected to produce approximately 10,940 kWh annually. All of the power produced by this array was converted into grid quality power by inverters and fed directly into the electrical grid. An estimated 10% of the energy would be lost in the 37

winter if the snow was allowed to accumulate on the roof array. Table 7 shows the data from the simulation, and Figure 13 illustrates the data graphically.

Design Process of the HV AC System 3.1 Preliminary design of the North House HVAC system

The Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a system where multiple mechanical components are linked together to fonn an overall system. The system provides desired comfort and an ideal indoor environment. An integrated HV AC system incorporating a heat pump, radiant panels, infloor heating and solar Domestic Hot Water (DHW) was initially designed for the Solar Decathlon house. Figure 15 provides a complete schematic illustrating the interconnection between the various components. A brief description of the system components is also provided in the following section.

3.1.1 Domestic Hot Water System (DHW)
The system consisted of vacuum tube solar collectors, a circulation pump, an external heat exchanger, an 800L pre-heat tank, and a 300L auxiliary tank. The pre-heat tank was directly heated by the solar collector through the glycol loop. The auxiliary tank was utilized for space heating and water heating purposes. It could be charged either by the solar collector using the external heat exchanger when the solar energy was available or by the heat pump when the solar gain was not sufficient. The water temperature in the auxiliary tank (AUT) had to be maintained around 55-60Â·C. In case the temperature in AUT dropped below 55Â°C, an electric heater located inside the AUT was activated to charge the tank. From the auxiliary tank, the hot water passed through a mixer, where it was mixed with the cold city water for the water services. The infloor heating loop and radiant panels were also connected to the AUT for space heating purposes.

3.1.2 Infloor System Layout
The infloor system was divided into four zones: dining room, living room, bedroom, and a washroom. The infloor system was connected to the auxiliary tank through a circulation pump. The temperature for infloor heating was around 30- 35Â°C, which was achieved by mixing the heated water with the return water.

3.1.3 Radiant Panels
Radiant panels do not rely on the movement of air but rather transfer energy directly to any building surface the panel "sees". Radiant heat, like that from the sun, travels in straight lines until it reaches a solid object. The energy radiated does not initially warm the air, it warms the glass areas, walls, furniture, floors, and people, and they, in turn, warm the air. The critical design parameter for a radiant ceiling system is the difference between the mean panel temperature and the average unheated temperature of all surfaces within the space. If the average unheated surface temperature (AUST) and the temperature of the air in a room equal the mean panel temperature (MPT), there will be no net energy exchange. When the AUST falls below the MPT, the panels radiate energy into the room. For this design the panels could be heated up to 60"(.

41

3.1.4 Heat Pump
A variety of options were considered for the selection of the heat pump for the house. The critical factor in the selection of an appropriate heat pump was the capacity of the unit. Generally, the vast majority of the heat pump systems manufactured is designed to support moderate to large heating/cooling loads typical for a single family home. However, the north house was a small house with a highly insulated building envelope, so the cooling/heating loads were minimal when compared to an average house. This led to the idea of designing and developing a custom-built heat exchanger.

3.1.5 Grey Water Heat Recovery System (GWHR)
A grey water heat recovery unit manufactured by GFX was utilized. The grey water heat recovery system used drain water from the house's water services to preheat city water going into the auxiliary tank. One of the complications introduced through the use of GWHR was the configuration of it. Since the system was vertically mounted, height restrictions of the plumbing fixtures in the competition were a critical factor. In order to resolve the problem, a horizontally mounted unit was considered but a reduction in efficiency and plumbing complexities would have been a challenge.

3.1.6 Heat Recovery Ventilation System (HRV)
The exhaust air collected from the kitchen and bathroom exchanged the heat with the fresh air through a Heat Recovery Ventilation unit (HRV). Extra exhaust was released from the kitchen exhaust. In addition to the HRV, a basic ERV (Energy Recovery Ventilator) system could have been considered. An ERV system can recover both sensible and latent heat and it may be beneficial in certain applications and climates (e.g. air conditioned house with hot and humid outside air), but the fan power is usually higher than that ofHRV and the sensible heat recovery efficiency is generally also lower than that ofHRV.

3.1.7 Air-Handling Unit (AHU)
The indoor air was circulated through the Air Handling Unit (AHU) and distributed to the living room and bedroom through the diffusers. The AHU was composed of the evaporator, filter and a fan. The fresh air passing through the Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV) was sent to air handling unit (AHU) and then was delivered to the house. 42

3.1.8 Option 1 System Analysis
The operation of the system and heating and cooling modes were investigated under a variety of different conditions. In all the heating/cooling scenarios, energy recovered from the exhaust air and the ventilation was achieved from the HR V system. The exhaust was collected from the kitchen and bathroom. There were several parameters that made the design not suitable for the competition. The system complexity was the major issue. In order to simplify the HV AC system, another system configuration was proposed.

3.2

Alternate Design

In the new layout the infloor heating was located in the bathroom and changing room. The
radiant panel heating was completely eliminated. Thus, a cooling pond was added in order to meet the house cooling requirement. Figure 16 illustrates the second option.

In order to break down the description of the overall system, the mechanical systems are

discussed in terms of domestic hot water heating, and space heating and cooling.

3.2.1 Domestic Hot Water (DHW) Heating
Two tanks were used for DHW heating. A stratified preheat tank was used for space heating as well as DHW heating purposes, and an auxiliary tank was used to provide DHW between 55-60Â·C. Water in the preheat tank was heated in multiple ways: solar thermal collectors, a desuperheater, and grey water heat recovery system. Primarily, an array of solar thermal collector was used to provide heat to preheat tank. A glycol loop was fed through solar thermal collectors and then transferred heat through an external heat exchanger to cooler water drawn from the bottom of the preheat tank. If the solar gain was not available to the thermal collectors, a desuperheater connected to a two stage air-source heat pump was activated to provide additional heat. During the summer, the hot water coming from the preheat tank might have high temperatures. When this occurred, cold city water (5-10'C) was mixed to bring the temperature down to the 55-60'C range.

3.2.2 Space Heating and Cooling
The conditioning of the house was divided into three different areas: the washroom and change room area (infloor heated), the living, eating, and sleeping areas (force-air heated), and the mechanical room (un-conditioned space). A two stage air source heat pump connected to an integrated air handling unit with a heat recovery ventilator/economizer was the primary source for both heating and cooling of the house. For the washroom and change room areas of the house, an infloor hydronic system was installed. It was used as both infloor heating, as well as cooling. During the summer, a small pond, located on the north side of the house, was used to assist the infloor cooling. For heating, a closed water loop, running through the preheat tank, was the main source of hot water for the infloor heating. In cases where the temperature of the closed loop water

44

exiting the preheat tank was not sufficient, additional heating was provided by a clamped electric heating element. Phase change material (PCM) was incorporated in the floor of the living, eating and sleeping area of the house.

3.2.3 Description of the Mechanical System for Different Scenarios
Different scenarios were considered in order to meet the house heating and cooling energy demands. A grey water heat recovery unit was utilized to preheat the city water going into the auxiliary tank for all the hot water production scenarios.

3.2.3.1 Cooling Scenario A: Sunny Days
Hot water system: Â· Â· Â· Primary hot water heating: solar thermal collectors Secondary hot water heating: de superheater Tertiary hot water heating (electric element): auxiliary tank

Space cooling: Â· Primary Space Cooling: Two stage air source heat pump connected to integrated air handling unit (AHU) with heat recovery ventilator (HRV) Â· Extra Cooling: When possible, the infloor hydronic system circulated water to the small pond. This only occurred when the temperature of the small pond was lower than the temperature of the water in the infloor hydronic system and if the slab temperature was higher than its ideal temperature.

3.2.3.2 Cooling Scenario B: Cloudy Days & Nights
Hot water system: Â· Â· Primary hot water heating: desuperheater Secondary hot water heating (electric element): auxiliary tank

Space cooling:

45

Â·

Primary space cooling: Two stages air source heat pump connected to integrated AHU with HRV. For nights that required cooling, if the ambient enthalpy and outdoor relative humidity were less than the indoor enthalpy and indoor relative humidity the economizer functioned and bypassed the HRV.

Â·

Extra cooling: The same condition as scenario A

3.2.3.3 Heating Scenario C: Sunny Days
Hot water system: Â· Â· Â· Primary hot water heating: solar thermal collectors Secondary hot water heating: desuperheater Tertiary hot water heating (electric element): auxiliary tank

Space heating: Â· Primary Space heating: Two stage air source heat pump connected to integrated air handling unit (AHU) with heat recovery ventilator (HRV). Infloor hydronic heating with a clamped electric back-up heating coil was the heating source for the washroom & change room floor areas.

3.2.3.4 Heating Scenario D: Cloudy Days, Nights & Early Mornings
Hot water system: Â· Â· Primary hot water heating: desuperheater Secondary hot water heating (electric element): auxiliary tank

Space heating: Â· Primary space heating: Two stage air source heat pump connected to integrated air handling unit (AHU) with heat recovery ventilator (HRV). Infloor hydronic heating with a clamped electric back-up heating coil was the heat source for the washroom and change room floor areas. Studies were performed to investigate the impact of different components on the energy balance of the house. The solar assisted space heating system and utilization of a small pond were modeled in TRNSYS separately for cooling and heating seasons. In order to integrate 46

the dynamic shading which had a significant impact on energy balance of the house, the proportional controller was considered. Due to the importance of the shading system on the heating and cooling demand, PID controllers were also investigated. For each analysis, the results were presented for the cities of Toronto and Baltimore, which provided the closest available weather data to Washington, D.C. in TRNSYS.

3.3

Solar Assisted Space Heating System

Radiant systems are widely used in residential building applications. However, air based systems are still the more popular option in North America. By analyzing the performance of both air based and radiant heating systems involving solar collectors, radiant floor systems were able to use more of the available solar energy to assist in covering space heating demands (Haddad et aI., 2007). The incorporation of solar thermal energy in the CIESOLXIX building reduced the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system and resulted in an annual reduction of 13 tons of CO 2 emissions (Rosiek and Battlles, 2009). In their proposed study, real data of an existing building were used to demonstrate the benefits of properly matching the passive and active solar techniques. The designed system was able to provide sufficient energy to supply an absorption machine during the summer and sufficient to cover the whole heating demand (Rosiek and Battlles, 2009). Several comparisons of different solar collector types and their mounting orientations were considered for the solar-assisted space heating system. The two solar collector types that were studied were flat plate collectors and vacuum tube collectors. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the optimal installation of the solar thermal system to maximize the solar thermal capture/utilization so as to reduce the overall space heating energy consumption of the house. The fluctuation of consumption for an electric heating element, as auxiliary heating, was analyzed according to the size of tanks, as well as according to the variation of the flow rate and the position of the auxiliary electrical backup heater in the tanks.

3.3.1 Description of the System
The mechanical system was described by separating it into three different loops: the energy acquisition loop, the heat exchanger loop, and the domestic hot water loop. The fIrst loop was the energy absorbing and collecting loop. It was made up of an array of solar collectors of 9m2 total surface area associated with a heat exchanger and with a preheat tank of 750L of storage capacity. The second loop was made up of a heat exchanger inside the preheat tank connected to infloor radiant loops. In order to study the effect of the infloor heating system more precisely, infloor heating was modeled for all the zones in the house, including washroom and change room. Also a one-ton air source heat pump (ASHP) acted as the main back-up heating for this system. The third loop was used for the production of hot water. It was made up of an auxiliary tank of300L equipped with two auxiliary heaters that could provide 2kW of heating each. The temperature was maintained at 55Â°C or above to be able to have the possibility of taking three showers of 15min length each, consecutively in the morning, as required by the competition's rule. A waste heat recovery heat exchanger was placed at the drain to recover part of the energy back to the inlet city tap water before going into the hot water tank.

In this study the focus was mainly on the fIrst and second loops, but the third loop was
simulated as well to allow the model to be more similar to how this system would perform in the competition.

3.3.2 Simulation Scenarios
A comparison between flat plate and vacuum tube collectors, and their orientations (vertical, horizontal and 20 degree tilt angle) was reported as the fIrst part of the study. The study of different types of collector (fIrst part of analysis) was based on preheat tank average temperature. For each case three different collector flow rates were considered, 0.3, 0.5 and

0.8Vs. The simulation time step was one minute and the simulation was run over one year
(8760hr). For the second part of the study, the main focus was the performance of the vacuum tubes integrated in the overall system. The installation was optimized to reduce the overall energy consumption which was mainly by the heat pump. For the vacuum tube collector, the simulations were run for: 48

The installation was optimized to reduce the overall energy consumption which was mainly by the heat pump. The simulation time step was one minute and the simulation was run over one year. Smaller simulation time steps increased the simulation time significantly while there was no additional information provided. On the other hand, the ASHP module did not produce consistent results when the time step was larger than 2.5 minutes. The selected tilt of 10 degrees was to conform to the competition rules regarding the allowed total height of the structure. The electricity consumption of the heat pump was analyzed while the size of the tanks was changed, as well as when there was a change in flow rate. Two flow rates of 0.1 and 0.2 Us were used in the simulations. These flow rates were determined based on preliminary test runs to find an optimum flow rate range that minimized the pressure drop while yielding good heat transfer coefficient. Also a flow rate of zero was simulated to allow for a comparison of heat pump consumption in the various cases. The zero flow rate to the infloor loop represented the case that there was no infloor heating. Figure 17 shows the layout and the different components of the simulation model created in TRNSYS.

3.3.3 Results from Simulation
The study of different types of collectors, vacuum tube and flat plate, for the city of Toronto, confmned that utilizing vacuum tubes results in a higher preheat tank temperature leading to a reduction in the heat pump power consumption. From the analyses of all the scenarios, it was seen that the house temperatures were maintained above the required temperature of 22Â·C for the heating season. This allowed the team to confirm that the annual heating demand was met by all the scenarios for both Toronto

and Baltimore. The temperature of the preheat tank varies between 20 to 70Â·C over the year. Useful energy gain from solar thermal collectors was around 3700kWhlyear for Toronto. Comparing the scenarios between the flat plate collectors and vacuum tube collectors, the vacuum tube collectors showed better results. There was a higher reduction in the one-ton ASHP's energy consumption. Figures 18 and 19 show the varying heat pump consumption for different tank sizes and flow rates with the vacuum tube collector system, consecutively.

From these results, the scenario where the flow rate was at O.2Us and the preheat tank size was 750L indicated the lowest energy consumption of the ASHP for both Baltimore and Toronto. It was worth noting that for Baltimore, if the flow rate to the infloor slab was low (O.IUs), increasing tank size would not decrease consumption, whereas for Toronto, regardless of flow rate, a larger storage tank proved to be better. Without the infloor heating system, the ASHP consumption increased drastically. The simulations showed that for Baltimore, the infloor heating system was capable of meeting most of the annual heating demand, and in Toronto, the ASHP was required, but consumption of the ASHP was reduced to 8% of consumption required if only the ASHP was utilized. Figure 20 indicates that the heat pump consumption increased when vacuum tube system was replaced with the flat plate.

The calculations demonstrated that with the higher flow rate ofO.2Us, the 750L tank. was the best choice in terms of heat pump consumption. Although the infloor system met most of the heating demand for Toronto and Baltimore both, the use of a heat pump was still necessary when the weather was at an extreme temperature (cold or hot temperature) or when no solar is available. The heat pump energy consumption for Baltimore was found to be lower than that of Toronto due to the milder climate.

3.4

Heat Dump Capacity of the Small Pond

The cost and energy effectiveness of passive cooling systems are both worth considering by homeowners. These techniques can be utilized in the overall system to reduce, and in some cases eliminate, mechanical air conditioning in areas where cooling is a dominant problem. Earl y studies for the climate of Shiraz, Iran indicated that utilizing a roof pond can reduce the cooling demand by 79.0% and 58.1 % for the cases of shaded-pond, and un-shaded pond respectively (Raeissi & Taheri, 1996). For the climate of Baghdad, Iraq, integrating an evaporative cooling system using a roof pond with the help of a mechanical ventilator for real-life conditions where the ratio of the roof area to exterior walls is reasonably large, the cooling load could be reduced by around 29% (Kharrufa and Adil, 2008). An alternative study showed that in an actual building the drop in cooling load for a single room is between 28% and 30% (Niles, 1976). Studies done in the Delhi climate indicated that the pond in a shade (e.g. by a tree) works better than the shaded-pond (e.g. under the deck) (Spanaki, 2007) (Tang and Etzian, 2004). The reason is that in the first case the pond water exchanges thermal radiation with the sky at night, whereas the shaded pond, which is shaded both in day time and at night, water exchanges heat with the ambient temperature in the shade. The cold sky as a heat sink for radiating bodies was considered as a potential alternative to conventional cooling techniques (Chen et al., 1991). The Cooling Storage Roof (CSR) research agency in Omaha, Nebraska concentrated on maximizing summer radiative and evaporative heat loss from exposed CSR surfaces (Chen et al., 1990). The coupling of the CSR with auxiliary cooling/heating systems could provide additional energy conservation. Combining that with the ground-coupled heat pump could result in load control features in addition to energy conservation advantages (Chen et al., 1990)

3.4.1 Description of the System
The analyses were perfonned assuming the pond orientation to be on the north side of the house. The pond dimensions were defmed to be 2.2 m wide, O.3m deep and a length of 12.3m due to the land restriction. The system was described by having one loop made up of an exchanger coil, with the outer diameter of 0.0 16m inside the pond and it was also connected to infloor radiant loops. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the reasonable length of spool, the diameter of the pipe and various flow rates.

54

3.4.2 Simulation Scenarios
A comparison between various coil diameters and tube lengths were analyzed while different flow rates were taken into consideration. The simulations were run for the cooling season, defined to start from May 1st to October 15th, when the house needed to be cooled down; therefore, the simulation time period was considered to be from 2880hr to 7032hr. The purpose of the study was to reduce the overall energy consumption by finding the best case. The simulations were done: Â· For different coil tube diameters

Furthermore the electricity consumption of the pump located in the pond loop and the heat pump were simulated to allow the comparison of the various cases. Furthermore the electricity consumption of the pump located in the pond loop and the heat pump were simulated to allow the comparison of the various cases.

3.4.2.1 Simulation Results
From the analyses, it was seen that the lowest pressure drop could be achieved by having the flow rate of 500kglhr (Tables 3and 4, Appendix B). The outside coil tube diameter of O.029m and inside ofO.027m for the case of Baltimore and O.022m, O.0 199m for Toronto were obtained when having flow rate of 500kglhr. All simulations were done considering that the house temperature was maintained below the required temperature of24Â·C and above 22Â°C. Comparing the scenarios between different tube lengths and diameters resulted in the minimum total pump consumption of21lkWh for Toronto and 27 1kWh for Baltimore as shown in Table 10.

A study of the pond pump consumption along with heat pump consumption over the cooling period indicated the pond cooling capacity met the cooling demand of the house. For the case of Baltimore the heat pump consumption is more. It could be explained by studying the outside temperature profile of both cities since the cooling capacity of the pond decreases with increasing ambient temperature and relative humidity. Figure 22 and Figure 23 show the temperature and humidity profiles of the two cities. While there is no dramatic difference between the humidity profiles of the two mentioned cities illustrated Figure 22, Figure 23 shows that Toronto is on average roughly 5Â°C colder than Baltimore.

The green graphs in figures 24 and 25 summarize the cooling demands of 1055kWh for Toronto and 4062kWh for Baltimore. Several occasions were detected for Toronto with zero cooling demand. The study of the house temperature for the case without the pond identified the time when cooling was not yet turned on but the house required to be cooled down. In order to measure the extra cooling power, simulations were conducted having the ti me extended from 2000hr to 8000hI. The data gathered revealed a need for 835 .37kWh and 647.96kWh of extra cooling demand for the city of Toronto than Baltimore respectively.

According to the obtained results indicating in table 11, it was more beneficial to use the cooling pond for the city of Baltimore. The total energy consumption of271kWh for the case with the pond was estimated to be half of the case without the pond, which was around 406kWh. In Toronto the heat pump consumption was obtained to be 67.0 kWh which was less than the pond pump consumption of211 kWh.

Utilizing PID Controller for External Shading

In the studies done by researchers for Toronto, Edmonton, Montreal, and Vancouver, Canada,

even the vegetative cover has an important role in saving residential heating and cooling ene_rgy use. According to the results obtained from their simulations by increasing the vegetative cover of the neighborhood by 30% (corresponding to about three trees per house), the heating energy in Toronto can be reduced by about 10% in urban houses and 20% in rural houses, whereas cooling energy can be reduced by 40% and 30% (Akbari and Taha, 1992). Studying peak power and cooling energy savings from shade trees in two houses in Sacramento, CA (Akbari et aI., 1997) yielded a seasonal cooling energy saving of30%, and a peak power saving of 27% in one house and 42% in the other. The houses were different in the floor area. Also the study of possible reduction of energy demand in residential dwellings in China using Simulink, which is based on Matlab, indicated that the shading factor can effectively reduce the amount of required sensible coolinglheating (Mozaffari, 2003).

3.5.1 Introduction to PID Controller
The PID controller calculation involves three separate parameters; the Proportional, the Integral and Derivative values. The Proportional value determines the reaction to the current error. Proportional control is how most drivers control the speed of a car. The only outputs used as a signal are not zero and one. There are proportional values from zero to one. The 61

Integral value determines the reaction based on the sum of recent errors, and the Derivative value determines the reaction based on the rate at which the error has been changing. Controllers are used in industry to regulate temperature, pressure, flow rate, chemical composition, speed and practically every other variable for which a measurement exists.

3.5.2 Simulation Scenarios
The goal was to defme a shading control strategy that could be modeled in TRNSYS simulation and also performed similar to the actual dynamic shading integrated in North House. For the pervious analyses (pond and infloor heating), the proportional controller was utilized in 'the model. A PID controller was utilized to control the external shading in the simulation studio. The optimum proportional gain, integral effect and derivative effect values were determined. In order to establish these values, we proceeded by examination, step by step, changing only one parameter within each simulation. Before running these simulations, the temperature set points were introduced. The temperatures set were at 22'C during heating and 24"C for cooling season, the values of the controlled variable could vary from 0.2 to 1 (1 means all the shadings were closed). The shading factor was set to be 0.2 which means 20% shading at all times. Several comparisons of different parameter values (integral "I" and derivative "D" effect) were studied. The best proportional value was set to be P=0.7 for all the season. The "I" value was varied from 0.5 to 5 hours and the "D" was varied from 5 to 30 minutes. The simulation was run for three periods of the year, heating season, shoulder season and cooling season. Figure 28 illustrates the time intervals defmed.

The numbers of occurrences (# of OCR), meaning when the house temperature was within the range of22-24"C, were calculated for each combination, and the combination with the greatest number of occurrences was selected as the best case for the corresponding season.

Chapter 4
North House Solar Domestic Hot Water and HVAC System 4.1 Description of the Overall System XX

The mechanical system in North House was designed with the goal of collecting enough solar energy to cover the majority of the domestic hot water and space heating demands throughout the year, while conserving every last watt of electrical power. Solar thermal energy was captured through the use of two arrays of flow through evacuated tube solar-thermal collectors installed on the roof. A three-tank. system was incorporated with the solar loop, including two advanced variable-capacity heat pumps. Each tank. was designed to serve a certain purpose: a large preheat tank. (PHT) whose temperature floated between 10 and 80Â°C (50 and 176Â°F) stored collected solar thermal energy, a space heating tank. (SHT) kept at a minimum of 30Â°C (86Â°F) supplied hydronic space heating, and a domestic hot water tank. (HWT) kept at about 50-55Â°C (122-131Â°F) provided hot water for the occupants' daily activities. The tank. temperatures and sizes were chosen to ensure that all space heating and domestic hot water demands were met with ease. Collected solar energy was delivered to the preheat tank. and distributed to the rest of the system. A heat dissipator system (Apricus HD-25 Heat Dissipator) was integrated into the solar therrnalloop in order to prevent overheated fluid from entering the preheat tank. and to prevent the collectors from getting dangerously hot. Fluid leaving the collectors was directed to the heat dissipators via a three-way solenoid valve whenever its temperature exceeded 80Â°C (176Â°F).

In order to save energy, only the required amount of pumping power was used. The pumps
had a three-speed manually chosen setting, and were adjusted to the lowest appropriate setting. Two fully variable speed pumps controlled by Johnson temperature controllers were utilized. One controlled the amount of "desuperheat" being delivered to the hot water tank. (HWT) and the other one controlled the amount of heat being transferred from the preheat

xx The North House final mechanical design and the description of the system were established by the North House engineering team. However. the energy balance study of the system using TRNSYS and the analyses of the data including simulation and the actual data obtained during the competition are done solely by the author.

tank to the exchanger coil of the heat pump assisted solar thermal. They automatically adjusted capacity to the minimum required. Space heat was distributed throughout the living space via a fan coil located in the air handler. Space cooling demands were met through a second custom modulating heat pump to draw the appropriate amount of heat from the air via an evaporator coil in the air handler. This heat was dumped to a cooling pond located in the shaded area under the deck. Figure 29 shows an overall design of the system.

The air handler and heat recovery ventilator were controlled via a Central Home Automation Server (CHAS), which adjusted operation based on frequently measured temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide content. Based on the temperature and relative humidity set points defined by the occupant, the CHAS automatically adjusted the mechanical system to deliver the desired conditions for thermal comfort. The CHAS also provided optional occupant overrides for fine adjustment of temperature and ventilation rates. The Branch Circuit Power Meter (BCPM) allowed for the measurement of power and energy readings for the grid connection, solar feed, and each breaker circuit in the main electrical panel. The CHAS also provided real-time and historical feedback regarding the performance of the

66

house through the GUI, where the occupant could inquire about the status of the house as well as configure system preferences, including home control Modes.

4.2

System Components

4.2.1 Three Tank System
The solar domestic hot water system was designed with the goal of keeping each component responsible for only one task, allowing us to fine-tune the system so that each task was performed optimally. The system consisted of three tanks, each designed to contain sufficient thermal mass at temperatures ideal to perform its intended function. The first tank was the preheat tank (PHT), a Bradford White stratified solar thermal storage tank (Model #: Ecostar S-DC-DW2110RSW) with upper and lower heat exchanger coils. The PHT tank served as a large thermal mass for the collection of solar thermal energy, facilitated through the evacuated tube solar thermal collectors. When adequate sunlight was available, sufficient temperatures were reached allowing simple distribution of heat to the rest of the system through the use of circulating pump and heat exchanger loops. The PHT tank contained two heat exchanger coils: Â· Lower coil for solar thermal loop (so colder water at the tank bottom was delivered to the collectors) Â· Upper coil utilized for supplying heat to low side (evaporator side) of heat pump #2

The tank receiving this heat was the space heating tank (SHT). The SHT was custom built from a plastic drum. It contained hand-bent copper heat exchanger coils (200 feet refrigerant tubing and 50 feet of water tubing). This 113.6 L (30 gallon) tank was responsible for maintaining a supply of warm water for the hydronic forced-air heating system ensuring there was a constant supply of warm water for space heating needs. Space-heating was achieved by cycling warm water to heat exchanger coils located in the air handler. The inner four coils (four circuits of 50 feet each) acted as a condenser for the solar assist heat pump, described in the following sub-chapter. In order to achieve the best possible performance of the solarassist heat pump, it was desirable to have direct heat exchange between the condenser coils and the hydronic fluid in the space heating tank.

67

The fmal tank was a Bradford White typical domestic hot water tank (Model #: M-2-HE40S6DS) with upper and lower auxiliary electric backup heaters (each 4500 Watt) for the absolute worst-case scenario when no solar energy was available for a long period. This tank ensured there was a constant supply of hot water for domestic needs. To increase the effective capacity of the domestic hot water tank, the cold water supply was plumbed to enter through the hydronic heating coils in the space heating tank in order to get preheated before entering to the HWT. This causes the domestic hot water tank to immediately begin to recharge when hot water was drawn, assisting the system to have an immediate response to meet the specific heat requirements of the occupant. If conditions are such that solar thermal alone cannot supply adequate heat, a solar-assist heat pump was activated, pulled heat from the preheat tank and upgraded its temperature for delivery to both the space heating and domestic hot water tanks. Such a heat pump assisting the solar thermal system provided a high-performance backup to the solar thermal, reducing reliance on the electric-resistance backup elements located in the HWT. More details on this heat pump are included below.

4.2.2 Direct-Flow Solar Thermal Evacuated Tubes
Viessman direct flow evacuated tubes were utilized (Model #: Vistol 200-T). The tubes were installed in an east-west orientation, with 24 degrees in south-facing tilt.

4.2.3 Variable Capacity Heat Pumps
There were dedicated heat pumps for both cooling and heating function. The heat pump Efficiency was improved because there was no reversing valve. The heat pumps had digital scroll compressors, Copeland TM digital scroll compressors (Model #: ZPD34K5E-PFV), allowing full modulation from 10% capacity to 100 %. This means that the heat exchangers were more efficient due to partial loading most of the time, and cycling losses were reduced or even eliminated. Electronic metering of refrigerant maximized efficiency of the refrigeration cycle. Large heat exchanger surfaces also contributed to improved efficiency. There were several reasons that the digital scroll compressor (DSC) was chosen over the traditional variable capacity compressor. One was because in DSC, the drive motor stays at a constant rotational velocity which results in no inertiallosses. Also, the actuation of the scroll mechanism is achieved using the high-pressure refrigerant already present in the compressor

68

(animation/diagram from Copeland website)XXI, and the electronic expansion control is one of the highlights of DSCs. Currently, digital scroll compressors are only available in nominal capacities as low as three tons, as they are typically used for industrial refrigeration applications. As such, we were forced to use heat pumps with over twice as much capacity as we expected to need. However, the highly-efficient way in which the compressors modulate allowed the system to maintain high-performance at lower capacities, while achieving rapid response when demands were higher than expected. Both heat pumps had a COP of about 5, and a COP of up to 10 for small delta T (temperature difference). The refrigerant used was R-41Oa, which has no ozone depletion potential. The system was designed to allow both heat pumps to efficiently deliver the required amount of heat to exactly where it was needed. Both heat pumps automatically adjusted their capacities in response to a signal from a Johnson temperature controller, allowing them to deliver only the required amount of heat, eliminating wasteful "cycling". For instance, heat pump #1 (HP1) adjusted its capacity to ensure that air was delivered at 12Â°C (54Â°F) for ideal cooling. And heat pump #2 (HP2) delivered most of its heat to the space heating tank (SHT) for space heating and domestic hot water purposes.

4.2.3.1 Heat Pump Assisted Solar Thermal
As the heat pump operated to upgrade the heat in the system, it could work to chill the preheat tank, inherently increasing the efficiency of the solar thermal collection. In the event of a long, cloudy period, it is even feasible to chill the tank to a temperature well below freezing (a glycol/water solution would be used), to the point below the temperature of ambient air so that the heat gain would be still possible by simply circulating fluid in the solar thermal loop.

4.2.3.2 Integrated Desuperheater in Solar-Assist Heat Pump
In order to allow the solar-assist heat pump to deliver heat to multiple tanks, an integrated
desuperheater (Model #: CDAX-5030-H) was installed, simply consisting of an appropriately-sized heat exchanger located upstream of the main condenser coils. This

69

allows high-temperature heat from the superheated refrigerant to be delivered directly to the domestic hot water tank. when deemed necessary. By circulating fluid in this loop via a variable speed pump, under typical operating conditions, up to about 10% of the delivered heat could be transferred to the DHW tank. The combined use of the desuperheater and space heating loads improved efficiency by reducing combined run times and increased effective heat exchange surfaces. A detailed schematic illustrating the high-side, low-side and de superheater exchanger is provided in Figure 30

4.2.4 Cooling pond
In addition to improved efficiency from the digital scroll compressor and electronic metering,
heat from the building was dumped directed to a cooling pond. Therefore, the thermal lift was lower because the cooling pond was cooler than ambient air temperature and often lower 70

than room temperature. Heat pump #1(HP1) acted as a dedicated cooling heat pump, pulled heat from evaporator coils in the air handler and delivered it to a pond located under the deck. As heat was dumped to the pond it increased the pond temperature, which then began to decrease because of the heat transferred to the ambient air through evaporative cooling and natural convection and conduction to the environment. This innovative tactic allowed us to get the benefits of a geothermal ground loop system without requiring any modification to the National Mall ground. Such a concept could be easily adapted to function with a large lake or pond located near the home, reducing the commonly high-cost of similar ground-loop systems. Figures 31 and 32 show the system layout inside the denspack.

Heat exchangers were engineered to maximize efficacy Pond temperature was lower that ambient air temperature resulting in lower thermal lift. Circulator requires 1/8 the power to transfer equivalent amount of heat compared to fan energy of air sourced unit.

Domestic hot water preheat coil Space Heating Tank (SHT)

Cold water supply to DHW tank passed through the coil in the SHT. Replacement water coming into the tank near the desired temperature required less work to bring it up to temperature. Innovative design incorporating closed loops for heat pump condenser and DHW coil. Tank had direct connection to solar tank and air handler hot water coil.

Â·72

This was the heart of the system connecting space heating loads to solar tank and heat pump while minimizing the need for pumps and heat exchangers. Variable speed pump on desuperheater circuit Variable speed pump on solar tank supply to heat pump This feature managed the flow of heat to the domestic hot water tank to maximize energy storage and reduced system cycling. This feature manages the flow of heat to the heat pump and ensures the solar tank is well stratified with cold water in the bottom. This helps maintain maximum performance of the solar collector by lowering the fluid temperature to the collectors.

4.3

System Performance in Simulation

The system was modeled in TRNSYS to evaluate its perfonnance in tenns of energy balance resulting in an estimation of the solar thennal energy production and the house heating demand. By competition rules (Appendix D), in order to earn full points, the following requirements had to be met: Â· Comfort Zone: o o Â· House temperature between: 22"( - 24"( Relative Humidity between: 40% - 55%

Hot Water: o Average temperature of 43.3"( delivered from the tap

Various calculations and simplified simulations were perfonned in order to verify the perfonnance of the solar thennaVmechanical system. A TRNSYS model of the three-tank was assembled. Many of the components used in the system could not be modeled using the available TRNSYS modules. Simplifications were made to the heat pump and heat exchanger bypass loop. The TRNSYS model aided the team in sizing mechanical equipment (heat pump, tanks, backup heaters) as well as the solar thennal collector array size.

4.3.1 Simulation Details
A calendar-based forcing function was set up in TRNSYS, based on the provided approximate schedule of domestic hot water (DHW) competition draws as summarized below. The following assumptions were made based on competition rules and regulations: Â· Â· A shower was set to a 10 minute, 56 L draw of water. Dishwashing was set to a 5 minute, 20 L draw of water.

The HWT monitoring temperature was set to 50'C and for the SHT tank the temperature varied from 35'C to 80'C (low set-point and high set-point). The simplifications made in the TRNSYS model are as follows:

Â·

It was not possible to simultaneously model both a heat pump and a heat exchanger
bypass loop between the preheat tank (PHT) and the space heating tank (SHT).

Â·

It was also not possible to incorporate dynamic heating demands on the system, due
to limitations on the stratified tank module used. o Hydronic heating demand was instead simulated by increasing tank losses in the hydronic tank (SHT) as specified in the following table (corresponding to the appropriate peak heating values for each month)

The simulations were run for Toronto and Baltimore and the simulation time-step was two minutes. For each city, the system energy balance was estimated for the heating season and cooling season individually. Table 19 describes how each season was defmed in the simulation.

Figures 33 and 34 describe the reason why the heating season defmed to end on April 15 and also the cooling period was set to end on October 10.

As shown in Figure 33, the red graph describes the house temperature, the blue one is the house heating demand and the pink is the house cooling demand. The simulation showed that even in October the house would need cooling in order to maintain the temperature below

The same scenario was repeated to set the heating period. Figure 34 below provides an explanation in that regard.

4.3.2 Simulation Results
For all the simulation scenarios the supplied hot water temperature coming out of the HWT was maintained above 43.3 Â·C as required by competition rules. However, the SHT temperature varied based on the heating demand but was well maintained in the temperature range set-points (35-80"C). Figures 35 and 36 show the HWT temperature and the auxiliary heater (electrical heater) signal for the case of Baltimore. The auxiliary heater set point was 50Â·C and it had an off-set of 5Â·C. As illustrated in Figure 35 during the heating season, the electrical heater turned on more often than in the cooling season shown in Figure 37.

The same procedures were performed to study the tank temperature for Toronto. The results showed that the backup heater, inside the HWT, turned on more often during the heating season than in the case of Baltimore. This is due to the colder Toronto weather during the winter. The majority of the heat extracted from the SHT was used for space heating purposes. The space heating demand over one year for Toronto is 1.6 times that of Baltimore. Figures 40 and 4 1 illustrate the HWT temperature and backup electric heater signal during the heating and cooling season for Toronto.

By analyzing the data obtained from the simulation, the total solar thermal energy production of the system and also the energy transfer between components of the system were estimated.

In order to evaluate the system performance, the annual space heating demand of the house
was estimated using TRNSYS. The annual hot water demand was calculated based on the average hot water draw of220 liter/day. The results are indicated in Table 20.
Table 20: Space beating and bot water energy requirements

Baltimore Space heating demand Hot water demand Total 2835 3737 6572 kWh/year kWh/year kWh/year

Tables 21 shows the data obtained from simulation after the three-tank system was modeled. The amount of energy produced by VTC and the energy transfer between the components are described in the table. The space heating demand of the house is also included so that it would be easier to compare the energy provided by the solar system and energy demand by the house. According to results, the system was able to generate enough energy to meet most of the energy required for space heating and hot water purposes. Approximately 3804 kWh of hot water demand and 2971kWh of heating demand were required. The system collected 5317kWh of solar energy (neglecting the system losses), thus the solar fraction for Baltimore over one year was estimated to be 81 %.

The solar fraction is defined as the solar thennal energy collected divided by the total thennal energy demand. For Toronto, this number was estimated to be 71 % as shown in Table 22. This should improve if a more thennally massive storage system is used (i.e., borehole storage or a larger tank).

The solar thennal energy production numbers were found by continuously running fluid through the collector as long as the temperature of the fluid coming out of the collector was higher than the one going in. In reality, the pump was only running when there was approximately SoC difference between the inlet and outlet temperatures (as controlJed by the solar thennal pump controlling unit). These numbers are therefore overestimated, but provide the team with a good approximation of the potential for thennaI energy production. The analyses were continued by running the simulation for different cities across Canada including Vancouver, Edmonton, Halifax and Montreal. The solar fraction varied from each city but it shows that the solar system contributed more than 60% of the system energy requirement. TabJes 23, 24, 25 and 26 show the results.

In Edmonton, Halifax and Montreal the space heating demand was relatively high. Therefore, the amount of energy consumed by the auxiliary heater inside the HWT is noticeable. The VTC production was the highest in Edmonton where the amount of space heating demand has the highest value.

While studying the solar thermal system, the simulation showed that for Edmonton, Halifax and Montreal. during the heating season, when the house needs space heating, the heating

87

system is required to operate over a longer period. Figure 44 shows the house temperature profile in Halifax. The pink graph indicates the space cooling demand and the red graph is the house temperature, It illustrates that even during the period defmed as the cooling season, the house temperature dropped below 22Â·C, as a result heating was required,

Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were performed for Toronto in order to investigate whether the design is close to optimal. In each scenario one variable was changed and the solar fraction for that particular case was calculated. Vacuum tube collector tilt angle (VTC tilt angle), preheat tank (PHT) size, solar collector area and domestic hot water demand (DHWD) were the parameters which were studied, Table 27 summarizes the results obtained from the analyses.

The result obtained from the base case (North House design) was used as a reference. Thus solar fraction of 71 % was compared with the result from different scenarios. As indicated in Table 27, having a larger collector area, bigger tilt angle and reduction of the domestic hot water demand by 60% increased the percentage of the solar fraction. Incorporating a bigger preheat tank slightly increased the solar thermal production; thus, the solar fraction changed by approximately 0.5%. The collector angle could not be increased and the amount of hot water demand could not be decreased due to competition rules. Utilizing more arrays of thermal collector resulted in reducing the number of PV panels. The solar fraction of the existing system compared favorably with that of a bigger collector area; therefore, there was no need to decrease the number of PV panels.

4.5

Competition Measured Data

The system performance can be verified by analyzing the competition measured data. Except for the house temperature and relative humidity (%RH), which were obtained from DOE measures, the data presented in this section are the data collected by Team North. Figure 45 shows how the heating system responded to the indoor temperature. As illustrated in Figure 45 the cooling and heating signal were activated in response to the indoor temperature variations. The house temperature was well within the range. However, on October 16, due to some unfortunate circumstances, the team was forced to completely open the door during the public tour. As indicated in Figures 45 and 46, the outside temperature was relatively low and %RH was high due to the weather condition. It was raining constantly for four days and it

89

was cold. Therefore, the system was not able to stabilize the indoor conditions. Figure 46 explains that the house maintained, on the average, 45%RH when the outside %RH dramatically fluctuated.

During the competition the SHT was maintained between 40Â·C and 60T (Figure 48), but on October 16 it dropped below 40T . The heat pump was constantly turning on and off to increase the SHT (space heating tank) temperature, but the system could not bring the house temperature above 18.63T. This number was the house maximum temperature recorded by DOE.

The temperature fluctuation inside the preheat tank (PHT) and space heating tank (SHT) is graphed in Figure 48. P3 is the pump in the bypass loop. It was activated when the temperature inside the preheat tank was high enough. Therefore, the heat was transferred to space heating tank directly without activating the heat pump. When the water temperature inside the preheat tank is not high enough because of insuffic ient solar availability, the heat pump HP2 signal was activated to keep the space heating tank to the desired temperature.

The solar thennal energy production is summarized in Figure 52. On October 7, the amount of PV generation according to Figure 51 was low; whereas, the solar thennal energy production on the same day was considerably high. The reason for that is because on October 7, teams were allowed to charge their solar thennal systems before the official competition time.

As mentioned before, when comparing the results from the competition data and simulation data, it is necessary to remember that the competition measures are based on Washington DC weather data, and the simulation results are provided based on Baltimore weather data. According to Table 28 the amount of the solar thermal energy production by simulation is more than that of the competition; whereas, the PV energy generation is more during the completion than the amount estimated by the simulation. The inconsistency can be explained by comparing the Baltimore and Washington ambient temperature and solar radiation data for

97

the 10 days of competition. Unfortunately, the solar radiation data for Washington DC was not accessible; therefore, the comparison of the solar radiation was not investigated. Based on the data measured by the team during the competition the outside temperature was compared to the Baltimore weather data. Figure 53 shows that actual outside temperature in Washington was colder than the average outside temperature data for Baltimore.

Energy Consumption

In order to evaluate the estimations based on the system modeled, the competition measured
data require to be analyzed and compared with the expected results from simulation. From the data collected in ten days of competition, the annual consumption of each individual component and system can be estimated. Table 23 explains the deviation in the energy consumption of components when estimated by simulation and by the data collected during the competition. While comparing the data measured during the competition and the data obtained from simulation, it is important to consider that the competition measurement was based on the Washington weather condition (actual data); whereas, the simulation estimations are based on Baltimore average long-term weather data. The weather characteristics of these two

98

geographic locations are slightly different. In addition, the estimated house consumption over one year is significantly higher than the consumption obtained from simulation. The reasons for that are explained in the following sections.

Using the data from ten days in Washington, the energy consumption over one year was estimated by simply multiplying the energy consumption during one day by the number of days in one year (365 days). This approach was used for all the equipment except the cooling and heating heat pumps.

99

In order to calculate the consumption of heat pumps, the cooling degree days and heating

degree days must be measured based on the hourly outdoor temperature (Washington weather data). A cooling degree day (CDD) is a formula measuring how hot it has been relative to a base temperature over a 24 hour period. The greater the number of cooling degree day measurement, the more the air conditioner needs to be running. A similar concept applies to that of heating degree days except a heat pump is the device expected to be working additional time. The cooling degree day is a guideline to help plan for energy usage. The method used to determine the cooling degree day number is to use the average temperature for the day in question. This average temperature would then be subtracted from 18Â°C. The result would be the cooling degree day amount for that particular day. After using this method over ten days for Washington weather data, the accumulated CD Ds and HDDs were obtained. These values were calculated for one year. Finally, knowing the heat pump consumption for CDD or HDD for ten days, the annual consumption can be calculated. The total CDD and HDD for Baltimore were estimated to be 644.8 and 2571 respectively. For the competition period in Washington DC, the total CDD was 8.5 and HDD was 40.3. The analyses of data in Table 23 is broken into three parts Â· Case 1: External shading, Interior Blind, Lighting, Bed, ALIS and miscellaneous loads Â· Â· Case 2: Appliances Case 3: Mechanical equipment

5.1.1 Case 1: External shading, Interior Blind, Lighting, Bed, ALIS
Having an approximately 369kWh energy consumption for the external shading is not considered as an efficient design and it was potentially unnecessary. By either manually controlling the shading and blind, or having a simpler controller, the consumption of 478kWh for both interior blinds and exterior shading, could have been reduced. The lighting in North House was initially designed to be a pioneer design in efficiency measures. However, the result shows that the electrical consumption is as high as in a typical house. According to a study done on the lighting electricity consumption per dwelling in

100

Canada (Fung & Ugursal, 1996), on the average, electricity consumption by a flat apartment in Ontario is 865kWhlyear which is relatively close to the North House lighting consumption. ALIS and Bed were not included in calculating in the house consumption. Miscellaneous loads including TV and laptop were close to the amount expected.

5.1.2 Case 2: Appliances
Expect for the washer and dryer, the appliance loads were as anticipated. In the simulation the oven was one of the appliances integrated into the house. However, during the competition it was not used.

5.1.3 Case 3: Mechanical Equipment
The dedicated cooling heat pump had a high consumption due to the competition public tour. During the public tour more than 1000 people walked through the house. As a result, the house temperature was increased. Therefore, to maintain the house temperature and relative humidity within the acceptable range in preparation for the test period XXTI which was scheduled to take place one hour after public tours, the heat pumps were working during these events. Depending on the outside weather condition either the cooling heat pump or the heating unit was required. In some cases when the weather was cold during the day, excessively cool air entered through the open doors. For that reason the heat pump consumptions were significantly high and since we used these numbers to estimate the annual consumption, the results show high values. The same scenario was applied to HRV and AHU. High consumption of the HVAC control was not predicted; therefore, it was not considered as a consumption measure. The overall results for energy production and energy consumption of North House are summarized in Figure 54. During the 10 days of competition in Washington DC, the PV system generated 271.6kWh of electricity, and the solar thermal system produced 91.7kWh while the house consumption was 249.lkWh. According to the obtained results North House was a net-positive house to a considerable extent.

Conclusion and Reconlmendation 6.1 Conclusion

Team North's goal was to design and deliver North House, while building Canada's next generation of leaders in sustainable design. The combination of active and passive solar design, integrated energy production, customized component, and mobile interactive technologies was a powerful vehicle of advancement in the Canadian New Housing industry. Despite the highly insulated building envelope of North House, energy harnessing was integrated into virtually every surface of the building. A large photovoltaic (PV) array on the roof, complemented by custom PV claddings on the south, east and west facades were the energy producer. The use of a three-tank heat transfer and storage system enabled the evacuated-tube solar thennal collectors on the roofto meet most of the hot water and space heating demands. The house featured both active solar technologies, such as solar thennal heating and PV systems, to maximize energy collection and production, and passive technologies to minimize energy consumption. In order to maintain an optimal balance between energy-efficient operation and a high degree of occupant comfort, these technologies were complemented by an intelligent integrated control system which helped manage the energy consumption of the home while notifying the occupants of their actions. The house was modeled in TRNSYS to initiate the system perfonnance assessment. Analyses were conducted for the city of Baltimore, which was the closest available city to Washington D.C. in the TRNSYS weather library, and five major Canadian cities. From the simulation results, the annual energy collected by the solar thennal system was 5317kWh, which resulted in the solar fraction of 81 % for Baltimore. For Toronto the energy produced was 5920kWh per year and the solar fraction was 71 %. The result also indicated that in different regions of Canada, some of which have extreme climate conditions, the design can still make enough energy to meet most hot water and space heating demands. As indicated in Figure 56, in Vancouver, Edmonton, Halifax and Montreal the solar fraction was estimated to be 69%, 64%, 66% and 67% respectively. Studying the energy balance of 104

the system also indicated that for each of these cities the heating season definition needs to be extended to some extent, meaning that in order to maintain the desired temperature inside the house the space heating system needs to be activated over a longer period than that of Toronto and Baltimore.

North House was predicted to annually consume less energy than it consumed during the competition. Results from the competition measures revealed that there were some unforeseen measures that should have been addressed. These miscellaneous, unpredicted consumptions increase the house energy consumption level. Some of these surprisingly high consumptions included the external shading blinds, ALIS, HVAC control and lighting. The cooling HP and heating HP were two devices which consumed surprisingly more energy that what expected. However, there were some explanations for some of these higher than normal heat pump consumptions. Unlike a typical house mechanical system, the North House heating and cooling systems had to operate in parallel during the competition period. The heating and cooling systems were required to operate simultaneously due to the weather conditions and occupancy level. Having more than 1000 people walking through the house on a cold and humid day required the heating system to prevent the temperature level from dropping significantly due to the cold air entering the house from open doors, and the cooling 105

system had to run when the occupancy level inside the house was high to avoid high temperature. In addition, both heating and cooling were required to maintain the indoor %RH level duo to higher than usual unwanted infiltration because of the public tour. Despite the fact that North House experienced severe weather changes during the ten days of competition, it was identified as one of the net-positive houses while maintaining the required level of thermal comfort. The house energy generation in ten day was 363.3 kWh (PV+ solar thermal) while consuming 249.2 kWh. As a result, the house used 69% of the energy it produced. This number could have been even less if more consideration had been taken to utilize more energy efficient equipment. The result of this combination of technologies produced a home that produced a surplus of energy annually, making the home net energy positive.

6.2

Recommendations and Future Work

Change requires action. To significantly conserve, increase and smartly distribute the energy generation to meet our energy targets - and thereby bring us closer to an innovation which is more than a net positive house - adaption of the following measures should be considered:
It is desirable to utilize more energy efficient appliances and reduce the lighting consumption

by reconsidering the lighting options. The automated components that consume high amount of energy, such as exterior blinds, HVAC controller, need to be replaced by a simpler, thus more energy efficient equipment. The electronic retractable bed which consumed considerable amount of energy could be either optional or removed. The heating and cooling heat pumps need to be replaced by the same type but smaller capacity since the capacities of the heat pumps were oversized for the North House application. When reducing the HP capacity the energy consumption will be significantly reduced. Utilizing an economizer with HRV is another option to reduce the energy demand by the house. The HRV and economizer can be manufactured as one unit. The economizer will be considered as mechanical equipment that helps to cool down the house. There is no heat exchanger inside the economizer to transfer the heat. During the time interval when cooling is

106

required the economizer can help to reduce the energy demand under certain conditions. In the early morning or during the night if the outside temperature and relative humidity are less than the house temperature and %RH , the economizer will by-pass the HRV heat exchanger and send the cooler outside fresh air inside and take the exhaust air out without transferring any heat between two streams. The only difference when economizer is operating is that depending on the amount of cooling required, the fan speed might be on the high cycle. Integrating infloor heating and cooling are the other option that assists in reducing the house energy demand. The infloor cooling can for some cases, such as Baltimore, eliminate the heat pump energy consumption as shown in section 3.4. Utilizing water conservation appliances, ultra low shower head and aerators are the solutions towards reduction of hot water demand. In addition, using a gray water heat recovery system assists in reducing the energy demand by solar hot water system. Having more thermal mass inside the building reduces the heating and cooling demand. PCMs can be added to the ceiling and walls to achieve this goal. A more significant step needs to be taken toward house energy analysis by having a regular progress report based on monitoring the system. The house needs to be monitored over a long period to investigate the performance of the system in more detail.

12.0 Misc. Plug Loads Refer to SUI

According to the above table energy consumption of the major appliances of the North House and the SUI house were significantly improved. Comparing with the typical home appliances, excluding the miscellaneous appliances, the energy consumption was reduced by 57% and 45% for the case of the North House and the SUI house respectively.

Minor and Miscellaneous Appliances:
Energy consumption by minor and miscellaneous appliances and electronic devices is highly variable on the ownership and discretionary usage of the number and type of equipment available. In North House project, plug loads were based on anticipated usage schedule and average power draws. Table 2 indicates the minor appliances suggested for the SUI house. Utilizing selected minor appliances resulted in average 69% reduction in the energy consumption to compare with typical appliances (Fung et al. 2007). The following is a table of certain categories of electronics that could have been used. Values were taken from different manufacturers.

The datalogger box is usually mounted in a vertical orientation to a wall surface at a height above the floor that provides convenient working access. The datalogger box is in a utility room or closet. The box can be mounted horizontally or upside is not available. The datalogger requires a small amount of electric power (approximately the house's electric system. with the burden on each house being about the same. A standard 120 receptacle is usually used to supply this power. The organizers communicate with the datalogger via a wireless modem located inside or adjacent to the data logger box. An external antenna may be required for successful wireless modem communication. However, in the past. no external antennas were required.

All of the scoring in Contest 6: Comfort Zone is derived from the measured dry bulb temperature and relative humidity inside the house, The plan to use a temperature and relative humidity sensor mounted inside a radiation shield to make this measurement. The sensor will be placed in a location that is representative of the temperature and humidity conditions through the entire house. This location will usually be between 4 and 5 ft (1 and 2 m) above the floor in the largest open room of the house. A location adjacent to a standard house thermostat is typical. In a closed bedroom, on an exterior wall, near the floor or ceiling. or near a window are all highly undesirable locations. If there is clearly more than one zone in the house, the organizers will install more than one

Thermocouples The temperatures inside the refrigerator and freezer will be measured with thermocouples. These measurements typically require the placement of a small wire through the refrigerator or freezer door so that the gasket closes around the wire. This approach was used in the past with satisfactory results. The organizers will identify a route for the thermocouple wires to be run from the datalogger to the refrigerator and freezer. If a team is concerned that jamming wires in the door will significantly impair the thermal performance, note that all teams are subject to the same installation approach. If a team is going to use a nonstandard door gasket, the organizers need to be made aware of it.
