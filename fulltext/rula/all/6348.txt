Abstract: Glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) have potential as bio-adhesives due to their ease of application, appropriate mechanical properties, radiopacity and chemical adhesion to bone. Aluminium (Al)-free GPCs have been discussed in the literature, but have proven difficult to balance injectability with mechanical integrity. For example, zinc-based, Al-free GPCs reported compressive strengths of 63 MPa, but set in under 2 min. Here, the authors design injectable GPCs (IGPCs) based on zinc-containing, Al-free silicate compositions containing GeO2 , substituted for ZnO at 3% increments through the series. The setting reactions, injectability and mechanical properties of these GPCs were evaluated using both a hand-mix (h) technique, using a spatula for sample preparation and application and an injection (i) technique, using a 16-gauge needle, post mixing, for application. GPCs ability to act as a carrier for bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also evaluated. Germanium (Ge) and BSA containing IGPCs were produced and reported to have working times between 26 and 44 min and setting times between 37 and 55 min; the extended handling properties being as a result of less Ge. The incorporation of BSA into the cement had no effect on the handling and mechanical properties, but the latter were found to have increased compression strength with the addition of Ge from between 27 and 37 MPa after 30 days maturation.

1. Introduction Minimally invasive procedures are receiving increasing attention in the field of orthopedics. Such procedures utilize injectable cements, usually, but not always, based on either calcium phosphate or acrylic cement chemistry. These materials can be molded to replicate the bone void and will then set in situ. Injectable systems offer many advantages over conventional bone cements and fillers, such as a reduction in the time it takes to perform the surgery alongside reductions in large muscle retraction, scar size and post-surgical pain [1]. Contemporary orthopedic implants often require the surgeon to drill out the surgical site around the implant, in turn causing increased bone loss, damage of adjacent tissues and extended surgical time, but minimally invasive procedures can ameliorate these issues [2]. Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) were discovered by Brown and Chow in the early 1980s and were originally used for treating dental caries [3]. The first CPCs were based on tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA), which, when combined, transform into HA at neutral pH under isothermic conditions and at physiologic pH [4]. Due to this, CPCs are osteoconductive and osseointegrative [3,5] but exhibit long setting times and insufficient mechanical

properties for most load bearing applications, particularly in tension and shear [3]. However, they are now employed as bone substitutes in non-load bearing applications [3]. For example, an in vitro study investigated the stability of fracture fragments following fixation using CPCs, with and without the use of supplemental K-wires for treating unstable fractures of the distal end of the radius; they also examined fracture fragments following alternative techniques of percutaneous fracture fixation [6]. It was concluded that CPCs, on their own, were not sufficient to endure the physiologic flexion-extension movements of the wrist. Supplemental wire fixation (K-wires) with CPCs offered more stability than K-wires alone; however, the combination was found to offer considerably less stability than augmented external fixation [6]. The authors suggested that when CPC is used for treating unstable distal radial fractures then it is best to use supplemental fixation. A second study was conducted that examined the utility of CPC95 (Biopex; Mitsubishi Material, Saitama, Japan), an injectable CPC consisting of -tricalcium phosphate (75 weight percent (wt %), tetracalcium phosphate (18 wt %), and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (5 wt %) in treating fractures of the distal radius [7]. Seven patients experiencing distal radius fractures underwent closed reduction; two were fixed with external fixation while the remaining five were fixed with percutaneous pinning [7]. A 1 cm incision was made, exposing the fracture. An 11-gauge needle (Jamshidi disposable biopsy/aspiration needle; Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA) was then inserted and CPC95 was injected into the fracture site [7]. Patients were placed in a short arm cast following the procedure to prevent mobility of the wrist. It was found that CPC95 had a higher compressive strength (c) (80­90 MPa) than cancellous bone (1.9­7.0 MPa) and a lower c than cortical bone (89­164 MPa) [8,9]. The range of motion for the augmented wrists averaged 56 of extension, 45 of flexion, 19 of radial deviation, 36 of ulnar deviation, 84 of supination and 74 of pronation. Patient grip strength averaged 20.6 kg, 93% of that of the untreated hand [7]. One patient experienced mild stiffness in the fingers, while another reported asymptomatic nonunion of the ulnar styloid [7]. Extrusion of the injected CPC95 into the extensor tendon sheath was discovered in six patients; CPC95 was spontaneously resorbed in five of those patients within six months, while surgical removal of the cement was necessary for one patient at six months following surgery [7]. CPC95 has the potential to be used in treating distal radius fractures due to reports of early mobilization and functional recovery of the treated wrist [7]. Unfortunately, CPCs display a lack of cohesion due to disintegration upon early contact with blood [10]. Additionally, CPCs suffer from long setting times and insufficient mechanical properties for load bearing applications particularly in tensile and shear [3]. Glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) were developed in the early 1970s [11] in the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (London, UK). GPCs have properties suitable for orthopedic applications as they chemically bond to bone [12,13]. The chemical bond occurs via ion exchange at the interface between the GPC and the mineral phase of bone. GPCs set by the reaction between an aqueous solution of polyalkenoic acid (PAA) and an ion-leachable alumino-silicate glass; once mixed, the acid attacks the network modifiers in the glass network, releasing metal cations that cross-link the polyanion chains of the acid, subsequently resulting in a cement containing both reacted and unreacted glass particles [14]. GPCs have, to date, been restricted to dental [15] and ear, nose and throat (ENT) applications [16,17] due to the presence of aluminium (Al) in the glass phase of all commercial GPCs [4]. However, attempts have been made to tailor Al-free versions of these materials for fracture fixation. For example, titanium (Ti) has been substituted for silicon in the glass phase of some experimental GPCs as Ti has excellent biocompatibility and also acts as a former and modifier in the glass structure [18]. Zinc and silver ions have been added to the glass phase of GPCs because of their antimicrobial activity [19], and strontium (Sr) ions have been substituted for calcium (Ca) ions in order to increase radiopacity of the cement and stimulate bone formation around the implantation site [20­22]. Germanium (Ge) has been incorporated into the glass as it adopts the role of a network former and is theoretically able to isomorphically replace Si in the network [23]. The work contained herein expands partly on the authors' earlier work [24], by further investigating the applicability of germano-silicate glasses as the glass component in an injectable GPC for fracture fixation whilst also evaluating the suitability of these

Glasses were prepared by weighing out appropriate amounts of analytical grade reagents and ball milling (1 h). Each mix was then oven dried (100  C, 1 h) and fired (1500  C, 1 h) in a platinum crucible and shock quenched into water. The resulting frit was dried, ground using Retsch PM 100 (Verder Scientific Inc., Newton, PA, USA) and sieved to retrieve a glass powder with a maximum particle size of <45 µm for all glasses. 2.1.1. Polyacrylic Acid Advanced Healthcare Limited (Kent, UK) supplied the PAA40 (MW , 35,000) and PAA200 (MW , 213,000). The acid was freeze-dried, ground and sieved to contain a maximum particle size of <45 µm. 2.1.2. Bovine Serum Albumin BSA (Fraction V), was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) 2.2. Glass Characterization The network connectivity of the glasses was calculated using Equation (1) [25] where SiO2 and GeO2 were considered to act as network formers and CaO, ZnO and Na2 O as network modifiers [24].

where NC = Network Connectivity, BO = Bridging Oxygens, NBO = Non-Bridging Oxygens. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a PANanalytical X'Pert PRO (PANanalytical Inc., St Laurent, QC, Canada). Glass powder samples were attached to a stainless steel disc using a 20 mm glass slide. The powder compacts were then placed in the X-ray Diffractometer and scanned in the range 10 < 2 < 80 , at scan step size 0.05 and step time of 10 s. A generator voltage of 45 kV and a tube current of 40 mA were employed using Cu k X-ray source. 2.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging was carried out with a JEOL Co. JSM-6380LV (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to characterize both the glasses and the fracture surfaces of cements. Compositional analysis was performed with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) Genesis Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer (JEOL Co. JSM-6380LV, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
