Abstract

Modelling and simulation of energy consumption in 86% of the Ryerson campus was presented. Energy simulation models were developed with Carrier HAP for 16 Ryerson buildings. Carrier HAP, commercially available software, was used for the prediction of energy consumption and PRISM software was used for the energy consumption comparison in different locations using weather normal average temperature data. All of the possible sources and uses of energy in the building were accounted for in the modelling and simulation. From the simulation result, it showed that 26% of total energy was consumed· by lighting and 19% of total energy used by plug load and 4% of total energy used by miscellaneous. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by reducing lighting schedule. As a result, annual energy savings of 10% for cooling load and 21 % for hydro demand were achieved, but the heating load increased by 14%. The other part of the energy consumption was for the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, 53% of total energy was demanded in this sector for the 16 Ryerson buildings. PRISM model was developed for compared Ryerson energy consumption and also compared Ryerson campus in different locations. The base case simulation result was compared with the campus planning actual consumption bill for the hydro, steam and DLWC cooling demand for the Ryerson campus. The result was under predicted from the actual bill. Simulation was under predicted hydro consumption by 5.7% and steam consumption by 6.26%. The average energy intensity was determined 1.04 GJ/m2 for the 86% of total area of Ryerson campus. Also energy intensity (GJ/students) compared with different province in Canada, result shows that Ryerson University consumed less energy and this value is 10 GJ/student.

Introduction Energy audit gives an in-depth knowledge of the existing energy consumption

profile of the audited object; it also identifies different factors affecting the energy consumption and brings up cost-effective energy saving opportunities. Energy audit makes an evaluation of the present consumption of energy, the feasible energy saving possibilities and produces the energy audit report. That is why energy audit has become an accepted first step in identification and implementation of various energy efficiency opportunities in residential, commercial, institutional and industrial facilities. The main target of the energy audit is to determine overall picture of the use and distribution of energy, its costs, energy saving potentials and the possibilities to use renewable energy sources. The core tools in the building energy field are the whole-building energy simulation programs that provide users with key building performance indicators such as energy use and demand, temperature, humidity, and costs. There are some building simulation programs as BLAST, DOE-2.1E, eQUEST, Energy Plus, ESP-r, Carrier HAP, IES <VE>, TRNSYS etc (Chowdhury et aI., 2007). This study was to conduct detail analysis of energy audit, whole building energy simulation using computer simulation program, Carrier HAP, for the purpose of energy performance evaluation of Ryerson campus. Ryerson University has a total floor area of 281020 m2 in 28 buildings listed in Table 1, including office buildings, educational buildings and residential buildings. ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 energy standard for buildings and PRinceton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) are selected for the overall energy consumption of 86% of total Ryerson University building area listed in Table 2. This university has two central cooling plants. One of them is located in the Library building with capacity of 3100 ton which serves 66% of total area; the other one is located in the Rogers Communications Center (RCC) with capacity of 530 ton which serves 11 % of total area. Deep Lake Cooling System serves 9% of total area and

own/self cooling system serves 14% of total area. Figure 1 and Table 3 shows Ryerson buildings served by the different cooling systems.

Steam and electricity usage characteristic of a building and its energy-consuming systems as a time-varying function of ambient conditions. Most computer programs can use as much detailed information about the building and its mechanical and electrical system as is available. Where the energy implications of these details are significant, it is worth the effort of obtaining them. Testing fan systems for air quantities, pressures, control set points, and actions can provide valuable information on deviations from design conditions. Test information on pumps can also be useful. Data on building occupancy are among the most difficult to obtain. Because most energy analysis programs simulate the building on an hourly basis for a one-year period, it is necessary to know how the building is used for each of those hours.

1.2.

Selecting an energy program
Energy simulation package selected in this study was Carrier HAP simulation

program. In selecting an energy analysis program, factors such as cost, availability, ease of use, technical support, and accuracy are important. However, the fundamental consideration is whether the program will do what is required of it. It should be sensitive to the parameters of concern, and its output should include necessary data.

11

Time can be saved if the initial input files for an energy program can also be used for load calculations. Some programs interface directly with computer-aided design (CAD) files, greatly reducing the time needed to create an energy program input file. 1.3. Energy programs to model existing buildings Computer energy analysis of existing buildings can accommodate complex situations; evaluate the energy effects of many alternatives, such as changes in control settings, occupancy, and equipment performance; and predict relative magnitudes of energy use. There are many programs available, varying widely in cost, degree of complexity, and ease of use. A general input-data acquisition procedure should be followed in computer energy analysis of existing buildings.

1.4.

Weather data Weather data, usually summarized for 30-year average in default for different

locations in the weather properties of Carrier HAP software (Carrier HAP, 2006) and minimum one year of daily average data is required for PRISM analysis for corresponding year energy consumption (Fels, 1986). The actual weather data for the year in which energy consumption data were recorded significantly improves simulation of an existing building. The purpose of the simulation should also be considered when chOOSing weather data: either specific-year data, data representative of long-term averages, or data showing temperature extremes may be needed, depending on the goal of the simUlation. Usually, the results of the first computer runs do not agree with
,

actual metered energy consumption data. The following are possible reasons for this discrepancy · Insufficient understanding of energy-consuming systems that create the greatest use, · · Inaccurate information on occupancy and time of building use, Inappropriate design information on air quantities, set points, and control sequences. The input building description must be adjusted and trial runs continued until the results approximate actual energy use. Matching the metered energy consumption precisely is difficult; in any month, results within 10% are considered adequate (Carrier· HAP, 2006).

Building energy audit
An energy audit and survey are parts of the energy management process in

buildings. Energy management in buildings defined as the control of energy use and its cost while maintaining indoor environmental conditions to meet comfortable and functional needs. The goal of energy management is to reduce energy expenses to the lowest level as possible without sacrificing comfort, productivity, or functionality. The specific processes by which building owners and operators control energy consumption and costs are as variable as their building types. Many buildings, such as residences and small retail businesses, usually involve the efforts of one person. On the other hand, very large and complex facilities, such as hospitals or university campuses, industrial complexes, or large office buildings, usually require a team effort and process as represented in Figure 9. The objectives of an energy analysis or audit are to identify and develop modifications to reduce energy use and/or cost of operating a building. The results should be presented in a format that provides the information needed by an owner/operator to decide if any, some, or all of the recommended modifications should be implemented (ASHRAE, 2007).

2.1. Types ofenergy audit
Most energy audits fall into three categories. Depending on the physical and energy use characteristics of a building and the owner's needs and resources, one or more of the three different categories of effort can be used.

17

i.

Walk-Through Assessment:

Walk-through is the least costly. preliminary stage audit. It is basically a visual inspection and a quick review of general energy data. It is usually done to determine the need for a more detail audit. The walk-through process could be relatively straightforward if the blueprints and other preliminary information available describes the building and its operation accurately. The process could begin with a walk around the building to study the building envelope. Building features such as building wall colour. external sun-shading devices, window screens and tint, and so on are noted as possible energy conservation opportunities (ECOs). If a model analysis is included in the study, the building must be divided into zones for analysis. The survey inside the building would include confirmation that the air-conditioning system is as indicated on plans. Additions and alterations would be noted. The type and condition of the windows, effectiveness of window seals, typical lighting and power requirements, occupancy and space usage are noted. System and plant data could be obtained by a visit to the mechanical rooms and plant room. Nameplate data could be compared against those in the building's documents, and spot readings of the current indicating panels for pumps and chillers recorded for estimating the load on the system. This involves assessing a building's energy cost and efficiency by analyzing energy bills and briefly surveying the bUilding, accompanied by the building operator. This level audit is most applicable when there is some doubt about the energy savings potential of a building, or when an owner wishes to establish which buildings in a complex have the greatest potential for energy savings. The results can be used to develop a priority list for buildings that are recommended for a Mini-audit or Maxi-audit. ii. Mini-audit:

This audit requires detailed analysis of energy invoices (preferable for the last 35 years), some tests and measurements to quantify energy uses and losses and to evaluate the economic potential of energy conservation measures. So this step energy audit can be called as Energy Survey and Analysis. This includes a more detailed building survey and energy analysis.

18

This level analysis identifies and provides the savings and cost analysis of all practical measures that meet the owner's constraints and economic criteria, along with a discussion of any effect on operation and maintenance procedures. It also lists potential capital-intensive improvements that require more thorough data collection and analysis, along with an initial judgment of potential costs and savings. This level of analysis is adequate for most buildings and measures. iii. Maxi-audit:

This audit is usually conducted as a part of detailed energy study. It contains an evaluation of how much energy is used for each function such as lighting, process, etc. It also requires a model analysis, such as computer simulation, to determine energy use patterns on a year-round basis, taking into account such variables as weather data.

Detailed energy audit procedure can be shown in Figure 10 as flow diagram.

2.3.

Building simulation
Building simulation began in the 1960s and became the hot topic of the 1970s

within the energy research community (Hong et aI., 2000). During these two decades, most of the research activities were devoted to studies of fundamental theory and algorithms of load and energy estimation. The beginning of the 1990s saw the growing global concern to protect the environment. In the building sector, the challenge to professionals is to create a healthy and comfortable built environment with less energy
~

consumption and reduced negative impact on the environment. The demand for green buildings has made the application of building simulation a must, rather than a need. Thus, Building Simulation Programs (BSPs) have gained acceptance as routine analysis and design tools. The building sector, one of the fastest growing in terms of energy consumption, National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) shows that nearly half a million commercial and institutional buildings in Canada provide the spaces for education, healthcare, government, and business services. But they also consume significant amounts of energy and produce carbon emissions. So it is clear that buildings are a primary contributor to global warming and ozone depletion (NRTEE, 2009).

22

The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) released a North American report in spring 2008 revealing that commercial and residential buildings are responsible for 33% of a" energy used and 35% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Canada. Research also shows that significant energy efficiency potential from existing technology in the commercial building sector. It is estimated that substantial energy savings can be achieved from a conventionally designed building through careful planning for energy efficiency. It is identified that heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting account for the major part of a building's energy use (NRTEE, 2009).

2.4.

Energy simulation
Unlike peak load calculation programs, building energy simulation programs

integrate loads over time (usually a year), consider the systems serving the loads, and calculate the energy required by the equipment to support the system. Most energy programs simulate the performance of existing systems, although programs are now available that make selections formerly left to the designer, such as equipment sizes, system air volume, and fan power. Energy programs are necessary for making decisions about building energy use and, along with life-cycle costing routines, quantify the effect of proposed energy conservation measures during the design phase. In new building design, energy programs help determine the appropriate type and size of building systems and components; they can also be used to explore the effects of design tradeoffs and evaluate the benefits of innovative control strategies and the efficiency of new equipment. Energy programs that track building energy use accurately can help determine whether a building is operating efficiently or wastefully. They have also been used to allocate costs from a central heating/cooling plant among customers of the plant. However, such programs must be adequately calibrated to measured data from the building under consideration. Furthermore, energy simulation is necessary because of recent work on computer energy simulation studies and field surveys reveal that air conditioning represents 37-60% of total electricity use in office buildings, in accordance with building's functions (Zhou et aI., 2007)

23

2.4. 1. Characteristics of building energy simulation
Most programs simulate a wide range of buildings, mechanical equipment, and control options. However, computational results differ substantially across programs. The choice of weather data also influences the load calculation. Depending on the requirements of each program, various weather data are used: · · Typical hourly data for one year only, from averaged weather data, Typical hourly data for one year, as well as design conditions for typical design days, · · · Reduced data, commonly a typical day or days per month for the year, Typical reduced data, non serial or bin format, Actual hourly data, recorded on site or nearby, for analysis where the simUlation is being compared to actual utility billing data or measured hourly data. Simulation programs differ significantly in the methods they use to simulate the mass effects of buildings, ground, and furniture. How accurate these methods are and how well they delay peak heating and cooling can lead to significant uncertainty in predicting building heating and cooling needs, sizing equipment to meet those loads, and predicting system energy needs. Both air-side and energy conversion simulations are required to handle the wide variations among central heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. To properly estimate energy use, simulations must be performed for each combination of system design, operating scheme, and control sequence.

2.4.2. Simulation techniques

Two methods are used in computer simUlation of energy systems: · · The fixed schematic technique and The component relation technique.

The fixed-schematic-with-options technique, the first and most prevalent method, involves writing a calculation procedure that defines a given set of systems. The schematic is then fixed, with the user's options usually limited to equipment performance characteristics, fuel types, and the choice of certain components.

24

The component relation technique is organized around components rather than systems. Each component is described mathematically and placed in a library. User input includes the definition of the schematic, as well as equipment characteristics and capacities. Once all components have been identified and a mathematical model for each has been formulated, they may be connected and information may be transferred between them. Although its generality leads to certain inefficiencies, the component relation technique does offer versatility in defining system configurations (ASHRAE,

2007)
2.5. PRISM analysis
Steam consumption for space heating and cooling, domestic hot water and also electricity consumption for air handling unit, lighting, plug load, pump, and exhaust fan for the Ryerson buildings are analyzed using the PRinceton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM). An objective of this study is to explain in physical terms the components of annual as well as monthly steam consumption and hydro consumption, and to discuss how physical parameters and their changes can be observed in the data (Fels, 1986).

2.5.1. PRISM overview
The original version of PRISM (PRinceton Scorekeeping Method) was released in 1986. PRISM, developed at Princeton University, uses utility bills from before and after retrofit installation, together with average daily temperature from a nearby weather station for the same time periods, to determine a weather-adjusted index of consumption, Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC). for houses or buildings. PRISM has been used by utilities, private companies. government agencies, and universities to estimate energy savings from conservation programs. The PRISM which was first developed to study the energy use in single-family houses with heating systems making use of the monthly billing data as well as the normalized daily outdoor temperature. For further development advanced PRISM project at Princeton University was funded by the Electric Power Research Institute, the Wisconsin Center for Demand-Side Research, and eight utilities, and it focused on "model tuning and data pruning." Model

25

tuning mean adding such features as a Heating-and-Cooling model, a Robust model, and an Aggregate version, while data pruning includes improving the reliability and usefulness of the data with functions like automated data correction and "outlier" detection. The main improvement was done on PRISM methodology in order to make the best possible use of the information available in billing data (Fels et aI., 1995) The Advanced Version of PRISM makes it easier than ever to transform run-ofthe-mill billing data into statistically sound savings estimates. With PRISM, utilities and energy analysts can systematically estimate total savings from a conservation or demand-side management program, for large samples of houses or buildings participating in the program, and for comparison groups as well. PRISM is a statistical procedure that processes a year of monthly billing data from a house or building to produce a weather-adjusted Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) index, along with other physically meaningful parameters and extensive reliability statistics. A key feature of the method is its estimation of best reference temperature to which heating and cooling degree-days in the model are computed. PRISM is generally run on the pre- and post-weatherization periods for all buildings in a sample to produce distributions of savings across the sample. With the new PRISM, participant and control groups are easily compared, in graphical and tabular forms. To run the PRISM following data is required: · · individual-building consumption data, including exact meter reading dates, for approximately one year in each period of interest, average daily temperature data, for the periods of interest, from a nearby weather station. PRISM gives results in terms of: · · · heating consumption versus heating degree-days, cooling consumption versus cooling degree-days, building's reference temperature for heating or cooling.

This report analysed electric energy consumption and steam consumption for both heating and cooling demands. In both cases energy consumption depends on degree days. Degree days are essentially a simplified representation of outside air temperature data. They are widely used in the energy industry for calculations relating to the effect of outside air temperature on building energy consumption. Degree days calculated from the sum of heating degree day and cooling degree day. Heating degree days (HOD) is a measure of how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), outside a.ir temperature was lower than a specific base or reference/balance temperature. They are used for calculations relating to the energy consumption required to heat buildings. Cooling degree days (COD) is a measure of how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), outside air temperature was higher than a specific base temperature. They are used for calculations related to the energy consumption required to cool buildings.

3.2.1.3. Lighting systems

Lighting load is a very important part for the overall energy consumption. Lighting load was calcljlated from the electrical drawing based on the lamp types, fixtures, total number of lamp used in the specific area, types of exit lights and plug load assumed for the computers, printers and electrical appliances. Some of these buildings' lighting loads were assumed from the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 standard because lack of lighting information. All of these information were then input in Carrier HAP to estimate electrical energy consumption for lighting and plug load.

3.2.2. Non-energized systems

Non-energized system of the building can be considered as building site, building envelope and building operation which did not use any electricity for operation.
3.2.2.1. Building site

Ryerson buildings are located in geographical coordinate of 43°40' Nand 79°25' W. Figure 12 shows entire Ryerson campus in down town (http://luna.ccs.ryerson.ca/stlhe201 O/downloads/campus_map.pdf).

3.2.2.2. Building envelope

The building envelope consists of those parts of the building that separate the controlled indoor environment from the uncontrolled outdoor environment. It typically includes the foundation, floors, walls, fenestration (windows and doors), and roof. Heat flow through the building envelope is mainly associated with the energy performance of buildings. In order to establish building energy simulation program for the Ryerson buildings, data was collected from architectural drawings and structural drawings for the building envelope including exposure as: · Wall assembly

Modelling Modelling is a major part of building simulation software. It includes building

model, HVAC system model and weather data. In building model it is necessary to consider building static and dynamic behaviour, occupancy loads, comfort requirements and control strategies like air quality, air temperature, and humidity. For HVAC system model could be described as air conditioning process, HVAC system components like terminal units, air handling units, and water, air, steam distribution systems. Figure 14 presents building model and HVAC system.

Building modeling
The dynamic behaviour of the building like transient heat transfer through walls,

energy storage in slabs, internal generated heat gains, and solar heat gains through windows, infrared losses, ventilation and heating/cooling devices are actually taken into account in order to compute heating and cooling load demands. Most of the Ryerson buildings can be modeled as large occupancy zone due to institutional building, surrounded by some of them external glazed and opaque walls.

Figure 18: HVAC system modelling (Bertagnolio & Lebrun, 2008) HVAC is the major part of the energy consumption for buildings. This study was estimated that HVAC systems consume about 53% of the total energy used in buildings. The study also was conducted in Montreal and it is estimated that 50% of the total energy consume in HVAC systems (Huang et al., 2006) The AHU model, including recovery system, economizer, filter, preheating coil, adiabatic humidifier, cooling coil, post heating coil, steam humidifier, main fan and return fan, is shown in Figure 19.

Weather data
Weather Data refers to the temperature, humidity and solar radiation conditions

experienced by the building and its HVAC equipment. Weather data has a significant effect on building loads and equipment operation. Weather data plays a key role in load calculations and system performance calculations. This project conducted building energy simulation for Ryerson University buildings using hourly analysis program Carrier HAP. Carrier HAP also used to refer to information about the geographical location of the building, the nature of local time and local soil properties. Ryerson University is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Figure 20 presents design parameters for weather properties used in Carrier HAP.

Figure 20: Carrier HAP weather properties (Carrier Hf.P, 2006)

HAP deals with two distinct kinds of weather data: · Design Weather Data is used to perform cooling and heating design load estimates. · Simulation Weather Data is required when performing 8,760 hour energy simulations. Simulation weather data refers to the 8,760 hour sequence of actual weather data used to simulate building loads and HVAC equipment operation over the course of a year. Results of these simulations are used to compute annual energy use and energy costs. This data is only used in HAP and not in HAP System Design Load.

Building simulation using Carrier HAP

Carrier HAP OveNiew
The purpose of this project is to application of Carrier HAP whole building energy

simulation program to analyses hourly energy consumption for the Ryerson University buildings. Carrier's hourly analysis program (HAP) by Carrier Corporation provides two powerful tools. The first tool is used to estimate the load and design system. The second tool is used to simulate energy use and to calculate energy cost. It also simulates 8760hr building energy performance to derive annual energy use and energy costs (Carrier, 2006). HAP uses six different calculation methods: · The Loads engine uses the ASHRAE Transfer Function Method to analyze dynamic heat transfer in the building, producing space cooling and heating loads, · The Systems engine simulates the thermo-mechanical operation of· air side systems, · The Sizing engine integrates with both the loads and systems engines to determine required sizes for diffusers, · ·
~ir terminals,

fans, coils and humidifiers,

The Plant engine simulates the operation of chilled water and hot water plants, The Building engine collects energy and fuel consumption data from the system and plant calculations and combines them with utility rate specifications to produce energy meter consumption totals and energy costs. and

·

life-cycle engine in a separate, but integrated program combines energy costs from HAP with purchase, installation and maintenance costs to derive life-cycle costs.

The program is a powerful tool for designing systems and sizing system components.

42

HAP can easily handle projects involving: · · Small to large commercial buildings, Systems including packaged rooftops, packaged and built-up central air handlers, fan coils, · · Many types of constant volume and VAV system controls, Small office buildings, retail stores, strip shopping centers, schools, churches, restaurants, large office buildings, hotels, malls, hospitals, factories and multiuse buildings and · New design, retrofit or energy conservation work.

HAP provides following extensive features for configuring and controlling air-side HVAC systems and terminal equipment. · Part-load performance models are provided for split DX units, packaged DX units, heat pumps, chillers and cooling towers, · Hydronic loops can be simulated with primary-only and primary/secondary configurations, using constant speed or variable speed pumps, · Energy costs can be calculated with simple or complex utility rates, the latter including energy and demand charges, time of day and year pricing, and demand determination clauses such as ratchets, Although HAP is powerful simUlation software it has following limitation: · · · · · Air system has a limit of 100 zones, Spaces up to 50 per zone, Up to 100 plants, Spaces up to 2500 per project, Maximum Wall constructions 8, window constructions 16, door constructions 8, and 16 shade geometrics per space, · · · Systems up to 250 per project, Plants up to 100 per project, Buildings up to 100 per project,

Figure 24: Parameters for the system components in Carrier HAP

CEO and most of the buildings using proportional airflow control model of uncontrolled or partially controlled ventilation air for variable volume systems and constant airflow control model for CAV systems and Engineering Building uses demand control ventilation (OCV) system, defined by C02 differential. Proportional airflow method control the ventilation airflow rate as the supply airflow varies. This ventilation airflow rate is calculates by the sum of space OA airflow ventilation sizing method. This method calculated the design ventilation airllow by summing the space outdoor airtlow requirements for all spaces served by the system. Certain ventilation standards and codes use this process. This system is also typically used when the building is not subject to a ventilation standard or code.

50

"

. .. .. ..
~

C02 sensors are used in each zone to control ventilation air for the demand controlled ventilation (DCV) models. Since occupants are the primary source of CO 2 in most buildings, measuring C02 is a means of indirectly measuring the number of occupants present in a zone. Outdoor ventilation air can then be adjusted as C02

levels change so the proper ventilation per occupant is maintained, while at the same time minimizing ventilation air and therefore the corresponding cooling and' heating loads due to ventilation. In this system C02 data will be collected to establish a control profile which relates a zone C02 levels to ventilation airflow rates. The Carrier HAP program performs a CO2 balance calculation to estimate CO2 levels at all points in the system. The zone CO2 levels and the control profile together determine the amount of ventilation air introduced into the system.

Outdoor air economizer is the factory default builds up in every air handling unit. An economizer is used to vary the flow of outdoor air into the system to reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling or heating. There are different types of control used in the economizer, some of them include: · · · · · integrated enthalpy control, integrated dry-bulb control, non-integrated dry-bulb control, upper cutoff, and lower cutoff As shown in Figure 25, most of the buildings at Ryerson University air distribution system can be described. In this system a portion of the room return air (RA) is exhausted (exhaust air, EA), and the rest is mixed with outdoor air (OA). The mixed air is cooled in the cooling coil (CC) for cooling demand or heated in the heating coil (HC) for heating demand and circulated via the supply fan, return fan, air distribution duct and VAV box arrangement. In response to the demand for cooling or heating from the zone thermostat, the supply air (SA) volume flow rate is varied by modulating the damper by controller. Similarly, controller maintains the supply air temperature near its set point value by modulating the chilled water valve. Also, the OA is controlled by modulating the outdoor air damper by another controller.

In zone component thermostat data can be set one set of data to all zones or data will be defined on a zone-by-zone basis. In the Figure 26, data for the CEO building zone is shown. In this case all zone T-stats set the same, that's why the zone name appear as "All Zones indicating common data for all zones is shown. The Thermostat Schedule defines the daily "occupied" and "unoccupied" system operating periods. In CEO building thermostat schedule selected as unoccupied cooling is not available to the whole system. There are three types of Fanrrhermostat schedule used for this system. Figure 27 shows weekday, weekend and holiday thermostat schedule.

Cooling and heating plant
Cooling and heating plant are the equipment and controls, which provide chilled

water to cooling coils and hot water or steam to heating coils in one or more air systems. Ryerson campus chilled water is supplied by the central chillers plant for 15 buildings and remote steam supplied by the enWave. Chillers plant data and remote steam information were collected from the campus planning and entered to the Carrier HAP software in order to generate plant sizing and energy uses. This report described the chillers plant and cooling towers information, which were located in the Library building and Rogers Communication Centre building. Based on the information was gathered from the Campus Planning Table 21 through Table 24 describe detail information for the chillers plant and Table 25 present cooling tower information.

Figure 29: Chiller input data form (Carrier HAP, 2006)

Air distribution system for these chillers plant selected as variable speed secondary type. One constant speed pump is paired with each chiller in the system. These constant speed pumps maintain a constant flow through the individual chiller or boiler legs in the primary portion of the system. Therefore, each primary pump operates at its design point. A separate variable speed pump, or group of variable speed pumps in parallel, drives flow in the secondary portion of the system. Two-way valves regulate flow through air system coils. A differential pressure sensor measuring pressure

between the supply and return legs of the secondary system controls the secondary pump speed to maintain a constant differential pressure. As a result, the secondary

61

pump rides the system cLirve as flow varies. This configuration is shown in Figure 30 below and Figure 31 shows the required data for the plant properties in the distribution system.

Energy rate

The flat rate of chilled water ($0.23/ton-hr) was calculated from the conceptual model of central chiller plant output data, located in the Library Building. This price was used all HAP model for calculation annual chilled water energy cost. The detail calculation is given in Appendix C. In order to lack of sufficient information from the Campus Planning, flat rate were assumed for steam $0.025I1b and for hydro $0.10/kWh.

Energy calculation and simulation

Buildings are built to provide a safe and comfortable internal environment despite variations in external conditions. Building energy calculation and simulation based on the energy uses in the building for different purposes, i.e. cooling, heating, lighting, plug load, etc. Generally heat loss and heat gain by conduction, convection and radiation is the main part of energy calculation process. Heat transfer through a solid material, referred to as conduction, which involves energy exchange at the molecular level. Radiation, on the other hand, is a process that transports energy by way of photon propagation from one surface to another. Convection heat transfer depends upon conduction from a solid surface to an adjacent fluid and the movement of the fluid along the surface or away from it. These heat transfer processes considered for heat balance method to determined building loads.

Base case simulation of Ryerson buildings using carrier HAP

As a base model for energy audit simulation study, 16 buildings at Ryerson University have been considered. The climate conditions for Toronto are 43.7 degree latitude and 79.6 degree longitude, high dry and wet bulb temperatures are 30.6°C and 21.7°C, the daily range is 11.2°C and CWEC weather location data was used (Carrier HAP, 2006). The heating and cooling load of the air system of the base case building depends on the actual schedules of occupancy schedule, lighting schedule, equipment schedule, fan/thermostat schedule and ventilation requirements. Energy simulation result obtained from Carrier HAP of the Ryerson base case buildings were compared with the Campus Planning energy bills for hydro consumption, remote steam consumption and maximum plant cooling load.

64

6. 1. 1.

Simulation results of the Ryerson buildings Building simulation reports contain energy consumption and energy cost data

produced by the building energy simulation program Carrier HAP. This report contained simulation result for the followings: 1. Comparative reports contain cost and energy results for individual buildings 2. Summary reports contain annual cost and energy use data for individual building 3. Detailed reports contain tables of monthly energy and cost data for individual building 4. Use profiles contain the hour-by-hour energy use profile for a building for one energy source or fuel type. · · · · 6.1.2. Annual components and energy costs HVAC and non-HVAC cost totals Monthly components and energy costs Monthly, daily and hourly air system simulation reports Lighting and plug load simulation result From Carrier HAP simulation result it is estimated that 49% of electrical energy consumption is due to lighting, plug load and miscellaneous uses. Figure 32 presents annual components electrical energy consumption in Ryerson buildings. From this figure it shows that 26% hydro consumption is for lighting, 19% hydro consumption is for equipment and 4% hydro consumption is for miscellaneous electric. So when attempting energy savings, lighting is the first area in a facility to look for savings because changes are usually easy and inexpensive. Table 26 presents' percentages of annual components hydro energy consumption and Table 27 presents annual components hydro energy consumption per square meter.

Heating load simulation
Maximum heating plant load is the sum of total heating load required for

group of buildings operated under a meter. The peak heating load for space heating usually occurs under very cold conditions. It occurs only for a limited time of the yearusually during very cold spell. Ryerson University used remote steam for heating demand. Most of the Ryerson buildings have humidifier for humidification of air which uses direct steam injection in the air distribution system. Table 33 shows peak heating load for Ryerson buildings.

Figure 36: Annual steam demand each building per unit area Ryerson University remote steam is used for a total area of 245842 m2 including Rogers Business Building (RBB) . There are two meters for steam consumption. Meter one serves total area of 223127 m2 (20 Buildings) including central chillers plant (for absorption chillers) located in the Library building and meter two is connected to RBB. The audit area for the 15 buildings (201658 m2 ) covers equivalent of 90.3% from the actual campus planning steam consumption bill of meter one. The calculation for this steam service area is listed in Appendix C. Table 37 shows annual steam consumption bill for 2006 from Campus Planning and compared with steam consumption obtained from Carrier HAP simulation program. Remote steam is supplied at a pressure of 250 psig, at this pressure the enthalpy for this steam is 825.8 BTU/lb. The conversion factor of 3.412 is used for kWh to kBTU.

Hydro simulation

Hydro consumption for the individual building depends on the space uses. The main components of the hydro energy consumptions are air system fans, cooling tower fans, cooling and heating loads, pumps (domestic hot water pump, domestic cold water pump, chilled water supply pump, condenser pump, heating glycol pump, sanitary sump pump, storm pump, fire pump, jockey pump, etc), lighting, equipments, and miscellaneous electric. Table 38 shows hydro consumption was calculated from Carrier HAP simulation for chiller plant model located in the Library Building and RCC Building.

Figure 37 presents annual hydro consumption per unit area (gross area and net conditioned area). From this figure it shows that comparatively Library building hydro demand is high. The reason for this high hydro consumption of Library building is to operate maximum hour of the year comparatively with others building, high plug load (computers, printers, cafeteria and other equipments) used in the study area, especially on the third floor (study area) of the building.

Sensitivity analysis From the energy audit and simulation it is clear that major part of energy

consumption in a building is for lighting, equipments and HVAC systems. Energy can be saved from HVAC system by reducing HVAC system operation when building or space is unoccupied. It can be done by rescheduling for the HVAC operating hours, eliminating HVAC usages in vestibules and unoccupied space, adjusting areas that are too hot or too cold, reducing unnecessary heating or cooling, implementing heat recovery system. Also changes of lighting schedule have significant effect on total energy cost. Figure 39 presents the comparison of cooling load consumption (kWh/m2) with base case economizer setting from integrated enthalpy to integrated dry bulb control and base case lighting schedule reduction by 20%. This comparison shows that economizer control change to the integrated dry bulb control have significant effect on cooling load. In this case cooling load consumption increased from the base case result. Cooling load also depends on the lighting schedule. If the lighting energy consumption increases, cooling energy will be increased. Figure 39 and Table 43 present cooling

86

consumption decreased with reduced lighting sched ule and also Fig ure 40 and Table 44 present electricity consumption decreased with reduced lighting schedule.

6. 1.7. Energy Intensity
Energy intensity was determined based on the total gross area from the total hydro energy and steam energy consumption in GJ of Ryerson University per square meter. The average energy intensity was determined as 0.91 GJ/m2 without chiller and 1.04 with chiller for the 86% of total area of Ryerson campus. Table 46 shows the energy intensity for each building of RU and Figure 42 shows linear regression for intensity versus building gross area.

PRISM analysis

The objective of this section was to assess the validity and usefulness of available energy consumption data in Ryerson University. This analysis includes steam and hydro consumptions for heating and cooling demands. The PRISM analysis conducted was based on the model of Heating-Cooling (HC).

6.2. 1 Energy Bill
Energy bill for electricity and steam consumptions are collected from the Campus Planning department for 44 months (May' 2005-December' 2008). This project covered 90.3% of total steam consumption based on the area analyzed. Energy bill information is listed in Appendix C.
6.2.2. Weather Data

Daily temperature data were collected from the National Climate Data and Information Archive website and Carrier HAP simulation weather data. Data was selected for nearby weather station Toronto Pearson International Airport, Ontario, Canada. The list of data was prepared in Excel file and attached in Appendix D.
6.2.3. Output parameters and energy consumptions

The output parameters from the PRISM were obtained in terms of building's reference (base) temperature based on 18°C for heating and cooling, heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), reliability statistic (R2), cooling/heating slope, annual energy use, base-level versus heating consumption and base-level versus cooling consumption. Table 47 shows the degree days information for 44 months billing period with reference temperature of 18°C.

The method used in this analysis is called PRinceton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) emphasized on the Heating-Cooling (HC) model. The method essentially performs a linear regression analysis between the outdoor temperature parameter and the billing energy consumption. The PRISM test was conducted for heating-cooling (HC) model for weather data from i) Carrier HAP weather simulation, ii) Toronto weather data iii) four years energy consumption data, iv) individual year from 2005 to 2008 data, v} every two years data and vi} one year overlapping data for both steam consumption and hydro consumption. The result of these analyses are listed in Appendix D. Based on these analyses for steam energy demand the best linear regression analysis of HC model was selected. This model was used 2005-2008 Toronto weather data and 2005-2008 steam consumption data. PRISM model was selected for hydro demand based on the 2006 weather data and 2006 hydro consumption. Once the parameters (a, r,3h, r,3c, !' h' !' c) were selected then Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC) could be calculated using Equation (1). The parameters of those selected models are listed in Table 48 to Table 50. The main equation used for the calculation of Normalized Annual Consumption (NAC):

6.2.4. Model selection PRISM model was selected for steam energy demand and hydro demand from the analysis of PRISM software (PRISM Advanced Version 1.0) output parameters. The first step for this software requires to creation of the temperature file and meter file. After successfully running the temperature file (degree days calculation-DDCalc) for the required meter file will be needed to obtained the PRISM output. The output parameters include heating reference temperature, cooling reference temperature, heating slope, cooling slope, base level consumption, reliability statistics (R2) and the coefficient of variation of NAC (CV(NAC». Figure 43 shows temperature file output from PRISM software.

Heating-cooling model (HC) PRISM analyses were run for combined 15 buildings and individual Rogers Business Building (RBB) for an initial assessment of the quality of the data. Two indicators of the goodness of fit from PRISM are CV(NAC), the coefficient of variation, which ideally is very small, and the model's R2-statistics, whose closeness to 1.0 (its maximum value) measures the extent to which consumption correlates linearly with degree-days (computed to the "best" reference temperature determined by PRISM) (Fels & Reynolds, 1992). Figure 44 to 47 present PRISM output for energy consumption versus heating degree-days and consumption versus cooling degree-days for the model.

Figure 47: Steam consumption versus cooling degree-days (HC Model) for RBB

Based on the reliability statistics (R2) and base level consumption PRISM model were selected for steam consumption and hydro consumption (Appendix D). Table 48 shows PRISM model for steam energy demand (temperature and meter file of 20052008) and Table 49 shows PRISM model for hydro demand (temperature and meter file of 2006) for combined 15 Ryerson buildings. Table 50 presents steam PRISM model for RBB for the meter and temperature file of 2008. Hydro PRISM model did not select for RBB due to insufficient data and very low value of R2 (R2=0.2843 for HO model, 0.3728 for CO model, and 0.4 for HC model)

6.2.5. Comparison of PRISM model (HC) for different geographic locations

Energy consumption in high-rise buildings depends on age of the building, number of stories, floor area, geographical location, types of energy used for heating, cooling, lighting, domestic water heating, number of occupancy etc. All of these factors were considered for energy audit and base case simulation for most of the buildings at Ryerson University. Energy demand also depends on the outdoor air temperature to maintain comfort air zone for the buildings. If the outdoor air temperature increases in the cooling season more hydro and steam energy will be required. On the other hand if outside air temperature decreases in the heating season more steam energy will be required to maintain comfort air temperature inside the buildings. Heating degree-days and cooling degree-days are the main parameters for determining energy demand for heating and cooling. These two parameters depend on the base reference temperature and outdoor air temperature and they also differ from geographical locations. PRISM model could predict energy demand for heating and cooling in different geographic

1

104

locations for the same buildings. In this case the total area of Ryerson University is assumed constant, all other energy used for lighting load; plug load and miscellaneous electricity are also constant. The expected energy consumption for the Ryerson University in four different geographic locations were estimated and compared. The geographic coordinates of the selected locations were found using GeoCoding process from GeoCoder.ca that assigns a latitude-longitude coordinates to a valid address. The weather normals for different locations were collected from the National Climate Data and Information Archive website (http://c1imate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/canadae.html) is listed in Table 51 and Figure 48.

From Table 54 and Table 56, it is clear that if the base level consumption is constant then energy demand will depends on the heating degree-days and cooling degree-days only. Figure 49 shows that steam energy demand is higher for Edmonton due to total degree days for the Edmonton location is higher than in other locations at 68°F reference temperature. Figure 50 shows that hydro demand is higher for Vancouver due to heating slope is negative and total degree days is lower than in other locations at reference temperature. Table 57 and Table 58 show Carrier HAP average temperature and PRISM (HC) model result for 15 buildings and Table 59 shows PRISM model for RBB.

According to the information of Ryerson University website, total number of staff is 1700, continue education students are 19039, undergraduate students are 22926, and graduate students are 1085. It is assumed that university staff works on a full time basis (8 hours/day, 5 days a week), undergraduate students have class 4.5 hours/day (5 days a week), graduate and continue education students have class 3 hourslweek. If the academic staff will be considered full time basis, then annually total number of people can be counted as 16105. If the undergraduate student will be considered full time basis then annually total number of student can be counted as 25609.Table 61 shows total energy uses at Ryerson University for the selected audit area.

Conclusion Energy audit and simulation for most of the buildings (86% of area) in Ryerson

University has been carried out. Energy simulation was done using Carrier HAP software. This study was conducted to balance total energy consumption for chilled water balance from the chillers plant. Steam energy balance and electricity consumption were calculated and compared to the actual bill for Campus Planning. For performing accuracy necessary data and information of the buildings has been collected and measured on site as the input of the model. Also this report conducted energy analysis and compared energy consumption for the Ryerson University in different location using PRISM software. Sources of the heat gain, heat loss and typical effect on the whole building have been predicted. The energy consumption profile of the buildings illustrates that 51 % energy used is for HVAC system and 49% energy is used for Non-HVAC system. For the HVAC system, 25% of the energy used during the summer season and 26% of the energy was used during the winter season. Annually, 26% of the hydro energy was used for lighting, 19% was used for equipment and 4% was used for miscellaneous. The three types of energy demands: chilled water demand, steam demand and hydro demand, were analysed in this report. From the analysis it showed that the Engineering building, Kerr Hall, Jorgenson Hall, Library Building and Rogers Business Building required more cooling demand in the summer season compared to other buildings. Because Kerr Hall has a different air distribution system, Library Building operates for the longer hours. and Engineering Building and RBB have lots of exposed area consisting of glass. their cooling are expected to be higher. This is because lots of internal heat gain and heat gain through envelope system. The data also shows that comparatively Kerr Hall needs higher heating demand. It is identified that having air distribution of constant air volume (CAV). Kerr Hall and IMA need more air supply. So both heating and cooling systems require more energy. Engineering Building, Kerr Hall, and Library Building have lots of equipments, lab equipments, computer that lead to higher electricity consumption. In addition, this will result in higher cooling load but lower heating load.

115

This report also performed a sensitivity analysis in two cases. One of these was on HVAC system and other one was on lighting schedule. The HVAC system for the economizer was switched to integrated dry bulb system. The present economizer setting is an integrated enthalpy system. This analysis shows that the present economizer setting is the most desirable system. The potential saving could be done from electricity uses. The entire audit area (86%) of Ryerson campus consumes about 26% of electricity in lighting system. So when attempting energy savings, lighting is probably the first place in a facility to look for savings because changes are usually easy, inexpensive. The second sensitivity analysis was done for the lighting schedule. In this case the program was run for the 16 Ryerson buildings by reducing lighting schedule. The output from the program shows significant saving in this case. It shows that by rescheduling lighting schedule, lighting electricity consumption reduced by 21% as well as 10% cooling demand decreased, but 14% heating load increased. PRISM HC model was established based on the Toronto weather data for hydro demand and steam demand. The results from these models were compared to the actual bills for Campus Planning, base case simulation from Carrier HAP model and PRISM model was established from HAP weather data. This model was also applied for the Ryerson campus in three different locations namely as Edmonton, Vancouver and Fredericton. This model shows that for steam consumption Ryerson University is the second highest and for hydro consumption Ryerson University is the second lowest position. This report also estimated energy intensity for the Ryerson campus. Result shows that Ryerson University in Toronto consumed less energy compared to other universities.

Recommendations Performing building energy simulation needs to account for many of things to the building environment, occupancy behaviour, building thermal

performance, building operating schedule. It also needs to identify the factors of wastes energy. This project was done based on the information gathered from the Campus Planning about the building operation and schedule with some assumption on the plug load and miscellaneous energy uses in the buildings. This project was completed 86% of the entire Ryerson campus, it is highly recommended that for further improvement of this analysis it is required to complete the remaining area for energy audit and find out potential savings from the analysis. It is also recommended to collect actual data for the plug load, electricity consumption for different types of equipment to determine accurate electricity consumption for entire Ryerson campus. The analysis showed that Constant Air Volume (CAV) air distribution system required more electricity for continuous recirculation of air. As a result in this system required more cooling load demand and heating load demand compared to Variable air Volume (VAV) system. Kerr Hall, Victoria Building, Jorgenson Hall and one part of School of Image Art have CAV air distribution system. It is recommended that for the potential savings CAV air distribution system must be replaced with the VAV air distribution system for those buildings. This report performed PRISM modeled and analysis for combined 15 buildings energy consumption (steam and hydro) and RBB only for steam consumption. For better result it is good practise to do PRISM model for individual building. To performed individual analysis for PRISM model, it is more important individual building metering data for different end-uses.
