Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in science and engineering. Simulations can be used to explore and gain llew insights into new technology. and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions. BIOPLUME

m is

a numerical two-dimensional model that tracks the fate and

transport of aromatic hydrocarbons. To help the environmental professional with the data management. visualization. and decision making tasks involved. Interpretations based on model analyses must recognize the significance of uncertainties in in put data. 1\ 10deIs of groundwater systems should be regarded as just OBe tool among many that can be used in the analysis of a ground-water quality problem. Numerical simulation can help the analyst integrate available data. evaluate conceptual models. test hypotheses pertaining to flow and quality changes. and predict system responses to alternative stresses. The models do not replace field data, but they help to guide the design of a more effective and more efficient data-collection program.

General
Leaks of petroleum products have been increasing over the last two decades because underground steel tanks installed in large numbers in the 1950s and 1960s have become corroded. Before 1980, Canada) Groundwater dissolves many different compounds, and most of these substances have the potential to contaminate large quantities of water. For example. one litre of gasoline can contaminate 1 000 000 Htres of groundwater. This problem is particularly severe in the Atlantic Provinces where there is a high usage of groundwater. In many cases, the problem is noticed long after the aquifer is contaminated, for example, when consumers start tasting or smelling gasoline.
In the development of policies and regulations for groundwater protection, in permitting, and
1110St

underground tanks were made of steel. Without adequate

corrosion protection, up to half of them leak by the time they are 15 years old. (Environment

in planning monitoring and remedial actions. the role of mathematical models is growing rapidly. Because water-resource management decisions should be based on technically and scientifically sound methods, quality assurance (QA) needs to be applied to groundwater modeling, both in model development and field studies, and should also play an important part in model selection.

Groundwater is water which occupies the spaces between particles of soil and blocks of rock beneath our feet. Groundwater is ubiquitous; it can be found beneath the Great Plains. the Canadian Shield and mountainous terrain on both sides of the North American continent. Groundwater constitutes almost 70% of the world's freshwater supply. In comparison. lakes and rivers make up only 0.2%. with the rest frozen in snow and ice. Groundwater can dissolve soluble rocks and its circulation is responsible for the formation of caves in limestone terrain. Groundwater, heated at depth. often rises to the surface to form hot springs like those at Banff and Jasper, Alta. and Radium and Fairmont, Be. (Canadian Encyclopaedia)
HydroID;~ic

Groundwater interacts with lakes and rivers as part of the hydrologic cycle. The cycle begins with the formation of clouds through evaporation from the ocean. lakes. rivers. plants and soil. Precipitation frpm the clouds either infiltrates as groundwater recharge or is diverted to lakes and streams as surface runoff. The propOliion of infiltration versus runoff is dependent on the permeability of the soil. soil moisture, the amount of vegetation. topography and climate. Infiltrating precipitation shares the interstices of the soil with air in the zone immediately beneath ground surface. At some depth the infiltrating water will encounter the water table. Below this surface the interstices are entirely occupied by water (no air present as a separate phase). and this is known as the $iVi.l11dwater zone. TIle region above the water table is known as the vadose Z011e. \Vater in the groundwater zone is not stagnant and flows from regions of high water table to lower water table. In many cases, the direction of groundwater flow follows the topographic surface. Eventually, most groundwater will return to the surface of the Earth in areas of groundwater discharge such as wetlands. lakes and rivers. The residence time of the percolating water in the vadose zone may be quite short (i.e., hours to days). depending on the depth to the water table. Conversely. the residence time of water in the groundwater zone varies greatly and transit times as short as a few days to greater than 10 000 years have been measured. In some geological materials such as sands and gravels, or highly

In areas where groundwater is plentiful and easily pumped, such as the aquifers in the sand

plains of south-central Ontario, the large sandstone aquifers in Alberta or the valley-bottom aquifers in New Brunswick. consumption for drinking water purposes is common. Groundwater is used as a source of drinking water by approximately 25-30% of Canadians. In some provinces, such as those in the Maritimes, the domestic use of groundwater is much higher. For example, the provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are 64% and 100% reliant, respectively, on groundwater as a source of water for domestic use. Use in the Prairie Provinces ranges from 24% in Manitoba to 54% in Saskatchewan. In addition, 82<,\; of Canada's rural population depend on groundwater for domestic use.

SIMULATION OF FATE & TRANSPORT OF CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER FOR SUPPORTING SITE ASSESSMENT

In addition to domestic usc. groundwater is widely used in industrial and manufacturing processes and for agricultural purposes. For example. more than half of the groundwater consumed in British Columbia is done so for industrial purposes. In l\1anitoba and Alberta. the majority of groundwater usage is by the agricultural industry. Because groundwater is an integral component of the hydrologic cycle. excessive consumption can adversely affect the sustainable use of surface water. Groundwater is a renewable but limited resource. For example. over consumption of local groundwater combined with the effects of global warming and of urbanization all negatively influence the groundwater component of wetlands ecosystems. In some areas of the country. development in rural areas is now limited by the sustainability (both quantity and quality) of groundwater supplies.
~'lan;J~:pme!lt

of Groundwater

l\1anagement of groundwater as a resource was ceded to the provinces ill the constitution act of 1867. Thus. authority to manage groundwater resources resides in provincial ministries. In practice. however. regional levels of governments often playa large role in regulating the use of groundwater through restrictions on consumptive use and industrial development. The federal government maintains a role in conducting research and providing advice to the provinces on matters related to groundwater contamination and consumption. StHlrc('s of (;roumhV,lll'r Contamination Since groundwater is an unseen resource and travels more slowly than the circulation of most surface water bodies (Le .. centimetres to metres per year). groundwater contamination often goes undetected for extended periods of time. For example. some types of groundwater contamination. such as road salt. have yet to significantly impact surface water quality despite being present as groundwater contaminants for many decades. Unfortunately. groundwater contamination is often detected through the adverse smell or taste observed in water wells adjacent to the source of contamination. The contamination of groundwater occurs through both point and non-point sources. Examples of non-point sources include road salt. agricultural chemicals. atmospheric deposition. land farming of industrial wastes and contamination from urbanizatioll. The most

common contaminants from these types of sources are chloride, nitrate and coliform bacteria. A survey conducted in 1~92 of farm wells in Ontario found that 31 % of the wells surveyed had levels of coliform bacteria above the maximum acceptable concentration (MAC), 13% had nitrate above the l\1AC and 8% had detectable levels of pesticides.
Point sources of contamination often result in elevated concentrations of contaminants that are

more localized, and arc more readily identified. Typical examples of point sources include leaking underground storage tanks, sites contaminated through industrial activity, landfills, subsurface waste injection, mining activities, large-scale chemical spills which occur through road or rail accident and a myriad of lesser sources. An example of a lesser source is the careless disposal of old gasoline used for lawn mowers, etc. As small an amount as a single litre of gasoline can render 1 million L of water undrinkable. In recent years, contaminated industrial sites and landfills have received much public attention. At many of these sites. groundwater becomes contaminated by way of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). TIlese are often mixtures of organic (and sometimes inorganic) compounds that do not mix well with water and have a density greater than water. Drycleaning solvents are a good example of a commonly found DNAPL. Clean-up of sites contaminated with DNAPLs has proven to be costly and ineffective. In Canada, sites contaminated by DNAPLs are only now being discovered and the cost to remediate these sites has yet to be estimated. Groundwater contamination occurs when man-made products such as gasoline. oil. road salts and chemicals get into the groundwater and cause it to become unsafe and unfit for human usc. Some of the major sources of these products, called contaminants. are storage tanks, septic systems. hazardous waste sites. landfills. and the widespread use of road salts. fertilizers. pesticides and other chemicals.

Storage tanks may contain gasoline. oil. chemicals. or other types of liquids and they can either be above or below ground. There are estimated to be over 10 million storage tanks buried in the United States and over time the tanks can corrode. crack and develop leaks. If the contaminants leak out and get into the groundwater. serious. contamination can occur. Septic systems can be another serious contamination source. Septic systems are used by homes. offices or other buildings that are not connected to a city sewer system. Septic systems are designed to slowly drain away human waste underground at a slow. harmless rate. An improperly designed. located. constructed. or maintained septic system can leak bacteria. viruses. household chemicals. and other contaminants into the groundwater causing serious problems.

In the United States today. there are thought to be over 20.000 known abandoned and uncontrolled hazardou~ waste sites and the numbers grow every year. Hazardous waste sites can lead to groundwater contamination if there are barrels or other containers laying around that are full of hazardous materials. If there is a leak. these contaminants can eventually make their way down through the soil and into the groundwater. Landfills are another major source of contamination. Landfills are the places that our garbage is taken to be buried. Landfills are supposed to have a protective bottom layer to prevent contaminants from getting into the water. However. if there is no layer or it is cracked, contaminants from the landfill (car battery acid. paint. household cleaners. etc.) can make their way down into the groundwater. The widespread use of road salts and chemicals is another source of potential groundwater contamination. Road salts are used in the wintertime to put melt ice on roads to keep cars from sliding around. When the ice melts. the salt gets washed off the roads and eventually ends up in the water. Chemicals include products used on lawns and farm fields to kill weeds and insects and to feltilize the plants. When the rain comes. these chemicals get washed into the ground and eventually into the water. We have to remember that since groundwater is part of the hydrologic cycle. contaminants in other parts of the cycle. such as the atmosphere or bodies of surface water. can eventually be transferred into our groundwater supplies. So now that you know the risks to groundwater. what can we do about it?

tanks across the United States. One of the main objectives of this text is to provide engineers and scientists with a modern treatment of remediation methods currently being practiced. but with all eye towards the future. Emcrging new technologies are rapidly coming into place as we learn more about some of the failures of the past. Earlier pump and treatmcnt systems. which did not consider the presence of NAPLs is source zones. have 110t cleaned aquifers to the required levels. t-.lany of the original systems worked adequately for a period of time. but after they were turned off. many sites had contaminant levels return to even higher values than before remediation. There have been success slories as well. with the discovery that many fuel (BTEX) plumes are limited in their extent due to natural attenuation processes. It is now widely recognized that EPA has given up the objectives of trying remediate shallow aquifers to drinking water standards. The actual use of these aquifers is now being considered in the overall evaluation of remedial opOops.

This chapter has given a brief background to set the stage for the subsequent discussion of natural attenuation and defining the associated parameters. These parameters will be examined with the aid of BIOPLUME III. a two-dimensional model which will simulate the natural attenuation process in the saturated zone. Chapter 2 of the project consists of relevant literature on this topic. Chapter 3 talks about computer simulation.

EVOLUI10N OF GROUND WATER INFORMATION A number of classic textbooks in the ground water field have becn written over the past thirty years. The field of ground water hydrology has expanded greatly since the fil:st American textbook by Tolman (1937). Todd's (1959) text, Groul1d Water Hydrology; stood a~ a classic in the field for many years and was updated with a new edition in 1980. DeWiest's text in 1965 and Davis and DeWiest in 1966 further advanced the subject with their books on geohydrology and hydrogeology. Bear's text written in 1972 and 1979 were departures from earlier approaches and emphasized the hydraulics of ground water, pro\l'iding a very theoretical deVelopment of flow and transport in both the saturated and unsaturated zone of engineers, hydrologists, and hydrogeologists. In 1979. Freeze and Cherry's GrouJ1d Water quickly replaced others as the standard in the ground water field for more than a, decade. Their chapters on transport chemical properties. and contamination are still of great use even today. The book by Pankow and Cherry (1996) provides a modcrn and com prchensive coverage of DNAPLs and chlorinated solvents. TIlcre has becn an explosion of literature in the past two decades. and there are numerous new sources of information and data in the ground water hydrology area. TIle United States Geological Survey (USGS) has primaty responsibility for the collection of ground water data and evaluation of these data in terms of impacts on water supply. water quality. water depletion. and potential contamination. Studies performed by engineering consultants for EPA and for industry during the remedial investigation or feasibility study of RCRA and Superfund sites also provide a useful description of applied methods in ground water, Other primary

sources of information are state environmental and water resources agencies. the American Geophysical Union. and the National Ground Water Association. Journals such as Water Resources Research. Ground Water. Journal of Hydrology. the ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering. and Environmental Science and Technology are major resources for exchange of information.

1\lathcmatical models have been widely used to simulate fate and transport of the nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) contaminants for risk assessment and remediation design studies (Chen et aL 1999). Rifai et aL (1987) developed a two-species bioremediation model. known as BIOFLUJ\1E-ll. to predict fate and transpOli of hydrocarbon contaminants that degrade via aerobic reaction. The model was recently updated to describe other anaerobic reaction mechanism for modeling hydrocarbon decay processes. However. many theoretical and field studies have recognized that the contaminant fate in the subsurface is significantly influenced by uncertainties inherent in natural porous media and thus may affect model predictions (Gelhar, 1993). These uncertainties generally emerge from heterogeneity of hydrogeological environment and scarcity of related data. and they can further be related to aquifer characteristics and/or physical. chemical. and biological properties of the NAPLs being released and transported. Such propeliy parameters can vary significantly from one site to another and also exhibit great spatial variability even within the same site. For example, hydraulic conductivity that spans orders of magnitude at the same site is not uncommon. Even with given the heterogeneity that exists in nature. it is simply not feasible to thoroughly define subsurface conditions at a given site. Attempting to do so would require an infinite number of borings. monitoring wells. sampling, and analyses; even if this work were done, the results would still be subject to nonunique interpretations (Adams, 1995). It is therefore essential that the fate and transpoli of NAPLs are simulated under parameter uncertainties. in order to provide robust information for enhancing performances of remediation actions. In the past decades. the increasing awareness for uncertainties of porous media led to an improved understanding of contaminant transport behaviors in subsurface. It has been

recognized that an optimal best-fit model calibration leading to a single averaged model prediction, even with some sensitivity analysis, is of limited usc and furthermore may suggest an

and misleading degree of accuracy. A deterministic model used for risk

assessment and remediation design that underestimates uncertainty inherent in the subsurface might cause severe consequences such as damage to human health or property. Conversely, a site remediation system design based on a deterministic model that overestimates uncertainty would waste resources (Maqsood et al.. 2003). Over the past years. various techniques were advanced and employed to address the effects of parameter uncertainty through transport modeling, including first-order second-moment analysis. response surface methods. reliability analysis-based approaches. and fuzzy set-based approaches (Hanunonds et al.. 1994; Chang et al., 1995). For example, Kaluarachchi et al. (2000) developed a Lagrangian stochastic methodology for analyzing field-scale biodegradation of hydrocarbons in aquifers, using oxygen and nitrate as soluble electron acceptors. TIle subsurface heterogeneity was represcnted using a spatially correlated random hydraulic conductivity field with a log-Ilormal distribution. Hu and Huang (2002) developed a nonlocal. first-order. Eulerian stochastic theOlY for studying reactive chemical transport in a heterogeneous. fractured porous medium under ullcertainty. Li et a1. (2003) proposed an integrated approach based on a modified fuzzy vertex method and applied it to the simulation of petroleum contamination in the subsurface. l\1aqsood (2004) developed an integrated fuzzy approach for quantifying relationships among uncertain hydrogeological parameters through techniques of fuzzy multi-attribute decision analysis and factorial design; furthermore. the health impacts from NAPLs contamination were also assessed. The stochastic method has been used as a more realistic approach for evaluating uncertainties in groundwater flow and transport simulation systems in recent years (Gelhar, 1993; l\1ylopoulos ct al.. 1999; Zhu and Sykes. 2000). It may be generally classified as analytical or numerical. TIle first includes random parameters as coefficients in partial differential equations that describe the system to be modeled. Then the stochastic differential equations are solved. generally using spectral analysis to analyze perturbed forms of the equations. The second involves solving the governing equation using numerical methods based on the probability distributions of the input parameters. among which the most popular approach so far is Monte

Carlo simulation (Lahkim and Garcia, 1999). Such a method consists of iterative individual sampling to produce multiple simulation realizations and then analysis of all of the realizations to present the final output results (Chang et a1.. 1995; Lahkim and Garcia, 1999). The output realization is usually presented in the form of a probability distribution or a cumulative frequency distribution. I\1any applications with such approaches were reported in the field of subsurface now and transpOlt modeling during recent years (Clement et al., 2000; Zhu and Sykes, 2000; Maqsood et a1.. 2003).

Limitations
Bioremediation studies are data intensive and require detailed site characterization of the key parameters for biodegradation. In addition. in many cases, particularly when nutrients or microbial populations are introduced into the subsurface. it is required to know how these evolve in space and time. BIOPLUMEIII has not been updated since 1997. BIIOPLUMEIII is a two-dimensional model and cannot simulate problems in three-dimensions.

Computpr Simulation & its important A computer simulation. a computer model. or a computational model is a computer program. or network of computers. that attempts to simulation/ simulate an abstract model (abstract) model of a particular system. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics). astrophysics. chemistry and biology. human systems in economics. psychology. social science. and engineering. Simulations can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology. and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions. Computer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes. to network-based groups of computers running for hours. to ongoing simulations that run for days.

Note that the term "computer simulation" is broader than "computer modeling". which implies that all aspects are being modeled in the computer representation. However. computer

simulation also includes generating inputs from simulated users to run actual computer software or equipment. with only part of the system being modeled, an example would be flight simulators which can 11In machines as well as actual flight software.

A continuous dynamic simulation performs numerical solution of differential-algebraic
equations or differential equations (either partial or ordinalY). Periodically. the simulation program solves all the equations. and uses the numbers to change the state and output of the simulation. Applications include flight simulators. construction and management simulation games. chemical process modeling. and simulations of electrical circuits. Originally. these kinds of simulations were actually implemented on analog computers. where the differential equations could be represented directly by various electrical components such as op-amps. By the latc 1980s. however. most "analog" simulations were run on conventional digital computers that emulate the behavior of an analog computer.

A special type of discrete simulation which does not rely on a model with an underlying equation. but can nonetheless be represented formally. is agent-based simulation. In agent-based simulation. the individual entities (such as molecules. cells. trees or consumers) in the model are represented directly (rather than by their density or concentration) and possess an internal state and set of behaviors or rules which determine how the agent's state is updated from one time-step to the next.

Distributed moods run on a network of interconnected computers. possibly through the
Internet. Simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred to as "distributed simulations". There are several standards for distributed simulation. including Asgregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP).

Although sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform sensitivity analysis to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. for example. the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a varicty of statistical distributions using the Monte Carlo method. If. for instance, one of the key parameters (i.e. the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure. then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures.

The following three steps should be used to produce accurate simulation models. calibration. verification. and validation. Computer simulations are good at portraying and com paring theoretical scenarios but in order to accurately model actual case studies, it has to match what is actually happening today. A base model should be created and calibrated so that it matches the area being studied. The calibrated model should then be verified to ensure that the model is operating as expected based on the inputs. Once the model has been verified. the final step is to validate the model by comparing the outputs to historical data from the study area. This can be done by using statistical techniques and ensuring an adequate R-squared value. L'nless these techniques arc employed. the simulation model created will produce inaccurate results and not be a useful prediction tool. .Model calibration is achieved by adjusting any available parameters in order to adjust how the model operates and simulates the process. for example in traffic simulation. typical

time. These parameters int1uence driver behaviours such as when and how long it takes a driver to change lanes. how much distance a driver leaves between itself and the car in front of it. and how quickly it stal1s to accelerate through an intersection. Adjusting these parameters has a direct effect on the amount of traffic volume that can traverse through the modeled roadway network by making the drivers more or less aggressive. These are examples of calibration parameters that can be fine-tuned to match up with charjlcteristics observed in the field at the study location. 1\1ost traffic models will have typical default values but they may need to be adjusted to better match the driver behaviour at the location being studied. Model verification is achieved by obtaining output data from the model and comparing it to what is expected from the input data. For example in traffic simulation. traffic volume can be verified to ensure that actual volume throughput in the model is reasonably close to traffic volumes input into the model. Ten percent is a typical threshold used in traffic simulation to determine if output volumes are reasonably close to input volumes. Simulation models handle model inputs in .:tifferent ways so traffic that enters the network. for example. mayor may not reach its desired destination. Additionally, traffic that wants to enter the network may 110t be able to if any congestion exists. This is why model verification is a very important part of the modeling process. The final step is to validate the model by comparing the results with what's expected based on historical data from the study area. Ideally. the model should produce similar results to what has happened historically. This is typically verified by nothing more than quoting the RZ statistic from the fit. This statistic measures the fraction of variability that is accounted for by the model. A high RZ value does not necessarily mean the model fits the data well. Another tool used to validate models is graphical residual analysis. If model output values are drastically different than historical values. it probably means there's an error in the model. This is an important step to
v~rify

before using the model as a base to produce additional models for

different scenarios to ensure each one is accurate. If the outputs do not reasonably match historic values during the validation process, the model should be reviewed and updated to produce results more in line with expectations. It is an iterative process that helps to produce more realistic models.

SIMULATlON OF FATE & TRANSPORT OF CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER FOR SUPPORTING SITE ASSESSMENT

Validating traffic simulation models requires comparing traffic estimated by the model to obscl'Vcd traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial 'comparisons arc for trip interchanges between quadrants. sectors. or other large areas of interest. TIle next step is to compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts. including transit ridership. crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screen lines. cutlines, and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as the central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district. Three sources of error can cause weak correlation during calibration, inpufenvr, model envr,
andparameter envr. In generaL input error and parameter error can be adjusted easily by the

user. ;., lode! error however is caused by the methodology used in the model and may not be as easy to fix. Simulation models are typically built using several different modeling theories that can produce conflicting results. Some models are more generalized while others are more detailed. If model error occurs as a result of this, in may be necessary to adjust the model methodology to make results more consistent. In order to produce good models that can be used to produce realistic results. these are the necessalY steps that need to bc taken in order to ensure that simulation models are functioning properly. Simulation models can be used as a tool to verify engineering theories but are only vaJid if calibrated properly. Once satisfactOlY estimates of the parameters for all models have been obtained. the models must be checked to assure that they adequately perform the functions for which they are intended. TIle validation process establishes the credibility of the model by demonstrating its ability to replicate actual traffic pattems. TIlejmportance of model validation underscores the need for careful planning. thoroughness and accuracy of the input data collection program that has this purpose. EffOlis should be made to ensure conccted data is consistent with expected values. For example in traffic analysis. it is typically common for a traffic engineer to perfonl1 a site visit to verify traffic counts and become familiar with traffic patterns in the area. TIle resulting models and forecasts will be no better than the data used for model estimation and validation. (Wikipcdia)

When a site has low levels of contamination, it may be feasible to allow the regulated substances to naturally attenuate as opposed to an active remediation method. In order to approve monitored natural attenuation. the responsible paliies must demonstrate that the site is likely to reach clean-up standards within a reasonable time. One of the requirements for this demonstration is a fate and transport model. The model may be either analytical or numerical and should include a report with sufficient detail that the reviewer would be able to duplicate the model. In order to assure that the model has been through an acceptable peer review, the model must also be associated with the EPA. dther approved in an EPA document. written by the EPA. or some other disclosed association.

BIOPLUME m is a numerical two-dimensional (20) model that tracks the fate and transport of
aromatic hydrocarbons. TIle user inputs 20 contour maps of hydrologic parameters such as hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity using a digitizing tool. Maps of initial concentrations of petroleum constituents and electron acceptors are input in the same manner. TIle model then calculates concentration contours at user-specified time intervals. using either an "instantaneous reaction" model based on stoichiometry. or a first-order kinetic model.

EPA version of popular 20 flow/transport/aerobic biodegradation model
BIOPLUME III is a 20. finite difference model for simulating the natural attenuation of organic contaminants in ground-water due to the processes of advection. dispersion. sorption. and biodegradation. Biotransformation processes are potentially important in the restoration of aquifers contaminated with organic pollutants. As a result. these processes require evaluation in remedial action planning studies associated with hydrocarbon contaminants.
It is based on the USGS solute transport code MOC and solves the solute transpoli equation six

times to determine the fate and transport of the hydrocarbons and the electron acceptors (02. N03-. Fe3+. S042-. and C02) and the reaction by-products (Fe2+). A number of aerobic and anaerobic electron acceptors such as oxygen. nitrate. sulfate. iron (III) and carbon dioxide have been considered in this model to simulate the biodegradation of organic contaminants. Three different kinetic expressions can be used to simulate the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation reactions. TIlese include, first-order decay. instantaneous reaction and 1\ lonod kinetics. The principal of superposition is used to combine the hydrocarbon plume with the electron acceptor plumes. The model has been integrated with a sophisticated ground-water modeling platform known as EIS. A graphical user platform allows the user to create. enter and edit data for model simulation. Discretization of time and space. hydrogeologic characteristics

CHAPTERS' RESULTS &. ANALYSIS
Case Study 1 Evaluation of Natural Attenuation of Ch10rinated Solvents in Ground Water.

OVERVIEW AND GOAL OF S1lIDY (the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant - Site A) Past disposal of solvents in' the soils at Site A at the Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant (TCMP) resulted in the contamination of the shallow aquifer with pcrchlorocthylene and trichloroethylene. in addition to other contaminants. Contaminated ground water moved in a northwesterly direction from the contaminant sources toward private wells of residence$ just n0l1h of the TCMP boundary., Remediation effortS have included soil excavation and the placement of pumping wells intended to prevent further migration of contaminated
groul1d~ater.

The long-term fate of the ground water plume is still in question. The presence of the cisisomer of dichloroethylene demonstrates that perc~oroelhylene is biologically degrading through reductive dehalogenalion at the site. This is important because natural attenuation studies ~t other sites have demonstrated that natural attenuation (which includes biological

degradati~n) is a large factor in the extent of ground water contamination and the time to
ground water restoration. TIle goal of this study was to assess how natural attenuation has influenced the development of the ground wafer plume at Site A and its role in the eventual restoration of the aquifer.

Background Natural Attenuation
Laboratory and field research have demonstrated that chlorinated solvents are biodegradable under certain environmental conditions. However. unlike the monoaromatic hydrocarbons , benzene. toluene. ethylbenzene. and xylenes (BTEX) that biologically degrade aerobically.,. chlorinated solvents. such as perchloroethylene (PCE)' or trichloroethylene (TCE) degrade,,' optimally under strongly reducing conditions. The reductive dehalogenation may be rapid under sulfate reducing or methanogenic conditions in ground water. Demonstrating that the ground water environment is favorable to reductive de halogenation processes is therefore important in an assessment of natural attenuation at a site and the long tenn fate of a contaminant plume. In addition. the metabolites of TCE or PCE degradation. cis dichloroethylene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), may break down under iron reducing or manganese reducing conditions in addition to sulfate reducing or methanogenic conditions. Hydrogen concentration in ground water Is correlated to the geochemistry at the site. and is a useful indicator of the potential for reductive dehalogenation. '.

'.

The combined effect of dispersion. sorption. and biological degradation on ground water contaminants can be quantified in tenns of the natural attenuation capacity at the site. This . ,. capacity may be large enough to contain the contamination within regulatory boundaries and conttibute substantially to' the collapse of the plume and restoration of the ground water. , .

Site A History and Description
Site A is located on the north end of TCMP (Figure 7). The water table is 15 to 19 feet below ground surface. with the Unit 1 aquifer ranging in thickness from 15 feet near the source area to 28 feet to the west. TIle soils consist of loamy. fine, sands with layers of iron oxide rich zones. TIle Unit 1 aquifer sediments are composed of lacustrine silt and fine or medium sands. TItis is " underlain by the Twin Cities Till (Unit 2) which. due to its high clay content. serves as an effective aquitard to the Unit 1 aquifer. Unit 2 is approximately 12 to 88 feet thick at Site A. ~ Ground water flows in a northwesterly direction toward Rice Creek with a horizontal hydraulic gradient in the area ranging from 0.0025 to 0.005 ft/ft.

Estimation of aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic gradient and
llydJuiYllanJic dispersion are important factors effecting transport. HydJl1ulic COllduCfivityis a measure of an aquifer's to transmit water and is perhaps the single

most important aquifer parameter governing fluid flow in the subsurface. TIle velocity of groundwater and dissolved phase contaminants is directly related to the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated zone. In addition. subsurface varations in hydraulic conductivity directly influence contaminant fate and transport by providing preferential pathways for contaminant migration. TIle most common methods used to quantify hydraulic -conductivity in the subsurface are aquifer pumping tests and slug tests
Hydraulic GradJclli is ,the change in hydraulic head (feet of water) divided by the length of

ground water flow. To accurately detenlline the hydraulic gradient. it is necessary to measure ground water levels in all monitoring wt:lls at the site. Because hydraulic gradient can change over a short distance within the aquifer. it is essential to have as much site-specific ground water elevation information as possible so that accurate hydraulic graaient ca1culatioJ1_s can be made. In addition. seasonal variations in ground water flow directions can have a profound influence on contaminant transport. To detennine the effect of seasonal variations in ground water flow direction on contaminant transport. quarterly ground water level measurement should be taken over a period of at least one year.

Sensitivity analysis was done to analyze the influence of permeability on simulation results. and found that the influence is rather slight in the case study. Assuming an aquifer thickness of 17 feet at the site. IT Corp. estimated in 1988 that the ground water hydraulic conductivity for Unit 1 was 8.3 x 10-3 cm sec-l (8.59 x 103 ft yr-l). Using a gradient of 0.005 and a porosity of 0.2. ground water velocity is estimated at 200 feet per year at Site A. Although it is unknown when solvents were disposed at the site. aerial photographs suggest that trenches and pits were used at the site for waste in the early 1940s. shortly after TCAAP was constructed. Historical ground water data appear to indicate the presence of multiple sources at the site but are difficult to define and fully delineate; however. the ground water contaminant concentrations at monitoring well 01UI08 are the highest detected at the site historically. Thus. for the purposes of this study. the area near well 0lUI08 is generally considered the primary source of chlorinated solvents to the Unit 1 aquifer. The ground water investigation at the site began in 1983. The primary concern was for the residences with private wells to the north and northwest of the site that were in the path of the contaminant plume (Figure 4). Subsequent sampling of these wells showed that TCE and cDCE were present in some of these wells. though none of the contaminants were detected above Minnesota Health Risk Limits (HRLs). No PCE was found in these residential wells. The highest concentrations of cDCE at monitoring wells 01 U902 and 01 U904 situated on the north side of County Road I were roughly 100

TCE. and cDCE concentrations as a function of time are also included for monitoring wells 01 UI08. 01 Ul17. 01U115. 01U902. and 01U904. Prior to 1999. contour maps show the plume consisting of two lobes. one emanating from the area of monitoring well 01UI08 and one from the area of monitoring well 01 U102. to the west of well 01 U 108. This conceptual understanding of the plume changed with analysis in the 1999 Annual Performance Report. when it was discovered that monitoring well 01 U125 was screened at the water table. As a result. water from this well

Results
Monitoring wells 01UI08. 01U117. 01U115, 01U902. and 01U904 were sampled on three occasions from June, 1997 through June, 1998 as part of this study (Figure 9). In addition, monitoring well 01U067. which is upgradient of the source area. was included as a background monitoring location. It is reasonable to assume that PCE and TCE were the only contaminants released at the site. Thus. the presence of cDCE shows that PCErrCE is being reductively dechlorinated in the ground water. However. similar to the chemistry of the deep ground water at TCMP. no vinyl chloride (VC) has been detected in Site A ground water. In. addition. no ethene (the ultimate product of reductive dehalogenation) was found at the site from 1997 through 1998. The absence of VC and ethene suggests that the degradation of PCE is incomplete. leading to the accumulation of cDCE with distance from the source. Table 2 shows the geochemistry of the ground ~ater sampled at Site 'A from 1997 through 1999.

SIMULATION OF FATE & TRANSPORT OF CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER FOR SUPPORTING SITE ASSESSMENT

found at well 01 U108 at 2.4 nanomolar. These concentrations are indicative of redox conditions consistent with sulfate reduction processes. These ground water conditions are not generally considered favorable to the reductive deha]ogenation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds such as TCE . Nonetheless. the presence of cDCE at this site is evidence that reductive dehalogenation of PCE and TCE is occurring. Thus. it was not clear whether a) natural attenuation is effectively reducing contaminant mass in ground water as it moves away from the source area. or b) if the contaminant degradation stops with cDCE, which simply accumulates in the ground water Wit~ distance. , To determine which of the two scenarios is more plausible. we modeled the contaminant plume with the fate and transport model BIOPLUME III to discover whether or not considerable mass removal due to natural attenuation processes is required to account for the observed contaminant concentrations. First. development of the PCE plume was modeled assuming that biological degradation of PCE was negligible. Under this scenario. the effect of the ground water extraction system is included. starting with well 350 in 1988 and continuing with the other eight wells in 1994. In the second simulation. the effect of biological degradation is added. Finally. assuming that the source of contamination will remain constant without intervention. the third simulation includes the effect of source removal in addition to pumping and biological degradation.

Model Simulation 1:
No PCE Biodegradation with Ground Water Extraction Starting in 1988 '

The PCE contaminant plume was modeled using BIOPLUME III using the ground water transport data for the site, but, no biodegradation. The model assumes that the initial concentration of PCE in the source area near well 01U108 was approximately 20 mg/L in 1950. Records indicate that well 350 began operating in 1988 at approximately 4 gpm and was discontinued in 1994. A second system of eight extraction wells downgradient of the source area was started in 1994 with a combined pumping rate of about 30 gpm. The effect of these extraction systems were in~orporated in the model The source area was simulated in

Further dowllgradient. the model predicts that in 1994 PCE would' have exceeded concentrations of 200 J.lZ/L in wells 234377 and 5553 (both private wells approximately 1650 feet from the source area).

Model Simulation 2: Inclusion of Biodegradation at -0.6 yr-1 with Ground Water Extraction Starting in 1988
In this simulation. BIOPLUl\lE III retains all of the calibrations as in Simulation 1 except that a biodegradation rate of peE is included at :"().6 yr-l. Under these conditions. the model predicts,
.
\

.

'

that concentrations in monitoring well, 01 U 108 should be approximately 40 ~L by 1998. TIlis is similar to the 'concentrations now observed in well 01UI08 (Figures 16-21). This simulation predicts that the PeE plume'should reach monitoring well 01 U 115 at 3 ~L in
;

-

1998; no peE should be found in monitoring well 01U904. and no peE is expected to migrate
t

~)

beyond well 01 U904 over the entire 50 years of plume development. This is in contrast to
, j

Simulation 1 which predicted that: without the effect of biodegi-~dation. peE should hive migrated 1600 feet downgradient of the source area at concentrations greater than 200 Simulation 2 accurately describes the development of the plume at Site A Assuming that the source area is not actively remediated and remains constant from now on the model predicts that these peE concclltrations should remain constant in ground water in the future.

Model Simulation 3~-Biodegradation at -0.6 yr-l with Ground vVater Extraction Starting in 1988 Complete Source Removal il1 2000
In the previous two simulations. the source of peE to the aquifer is assumed constant after
\

1990. With biodegradation and pumping included. the model predicts that PCE concentrations'
. .!" -« ·

in the ground water will remain at approximately 40 J.l$iL in monitoring well 01 U 108. with the plume extending a distance of approximately 420 feet from the source area. These concentrations would remain unaltered as long as the source of contamination is unaffected. ,
'

~.

.

Army has proposed a combined soil vapor extraction and ground water sparging system' in the source area near monitoring well 01 U 108 to eliminate any remai~ing contribution of peE to
, " I '

the ground water. Simulation 3 includes the effect of a 90% source relllOval at Site A in 2001
\

while maintaining the initial release assumptions. the biological degradation rate. ground water transport parameters. and the effects of pumping that were included in the previous simulations (Figures 22-25). This was accomplished in BIOPLUME III by reducing the injection concentration (which simulates the source in the model) by 90%. The model shows that once the source of peE is gone. the peE contaminant plume should collapse rapidly (provided that the biodegradation rate is not adversely affected by ground water aeration). with ground water concentrations below 3 J.l$iL by 2005.

TIle increasing public awareness and concern about the hazards of toxic chemicals contaminating aquifers has created an increased need for predictive capabilities to analyze ground-water contamination problems. Several digital models to simulate the movement and concentration of ground-water contaminants have been documented recently. Most simulate the transport and dispersion of a nonreactive solute. but some include mathematically simple reaction terms to represent decay and sorption processes. For applications to field problems, these solute-transpolt models impose data requirements that. in general. exceed our practical capabilities to accurately describe the field properties and stresses of the hydraulic and chemical systems. Thus. interpretations based on model analyses must recognize the significance of unceltainties in input data. Models of ground-water systems should be regarded as just one tool among many that can be used in the analysis of a ground-water quality problem. Numerical simulation can help the analyst integrate available data. evaluate conceptual models. test hypotheses pertaining to flow and quality changes. and predict system responses to alternative stresses. TIle models do not replace field data. but they do offer a feedback mechanism that can help to guide the design of a more effective and more efficient data-collection program. Although the precise date of the contaminant release at Site A in case study 1 is unknown. varying the exact year of the release and the initial concentration does not significantly influence the outcome of the BIOPLUl\ 1E III simulations. If biodegradation is really negligible in the ground water. Simulation 1 shows that very high concentrations of peE should have been detected far downgradient of the source area by 1988 and that dilution/dispersion alone cannot account for the difference between observed concentrations and those predicted by BIOPLUME Ill. Incorporating a biodegradation rate of -0.6 yr-1 is required to simulate the

reduction in the PCE concentrations with distance to levels observed in the past 10 years (Table
4).
In addition. the PCE breakdown products. TCE and cOCE. are 110t accumulating with distance

in the ground water (see trend graphs for indvidual wells.). TIle loss of TCE can be attributed to its dehalogcnation to cOCE. TIle fate of cOCE in the ground water is less clear, VC and ethene _ the products of cOCE reductive dehalogcnation - were never detected in ground water samples. indicating that cOCE is not reductively dehalogenated at this site. However. historical data show that the highest concentrations of cDCE discovered in the dowl1gradient area of the plume were in the range of 100 jlg/L in monitoring well 01 U902. with detections below the HRL in private wells 234377 and 5553 fmiher dowl1gradient. cDCE was never detected at concentrations in the range of I 000 ~lg/L in downgradient ground water that would support thc idea that the mass of contaminants. represented by PCE. TCE. and DCE, was ever conserved in the ground water as it moved from the source area to County Road I. Historical contour maps show that the contaminant plume has basically remained stable since 1991. with some indication that the plume is shrinking in size and concentration (see trend graphs and isocol1centration drawings). It is possible. though 110t yet demonstrated at this site, that cOCE is degrading through anaerobic oxidation, a process that would not yield VC or ethene. Similarly, cDCE is also suspected of degrading without yielding VC or ethene in the deep ground water at TCAAP Simulation 3 includes the effect of a 90% source removal at Site A in 2001 while maintaining the initial release assumptions, the biological degradation rate, ground water transpOli parameters. and the effects of pumping that were included in the previous simulations (Figures 22-25). TIlis was accomplished in BIOPLUME III by reducing the injection concentration (which simulates the source in the model) by 90%. TIle model shows that once the source of PCE is gone. the PCE contaminant plume should colIaFse rapidly (provided that the biodegradation rate is not adversely affected by ground water aeration). with ground water concentrations below 3
~g/L

by 2005.
