1. Introduction
Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem was given more attention in the past couple of decades, while the power industry worldwide develops towards a more competitive environment. The objective function in OPF is the operating cost of the generating units and the solution is the exact economic dispatch with the minimum generation cost and transmission losses [1]. OPF has been frequently solved using typical optimization method and technique on computer using MATLAB and different optimization toolbox like fmincon that has become standard practice to solve a lot of optimization problems. This toolbox from MATLAB has three algorithms, with several options for Hessians, including fmincon trust region reflective algorithm, fmincon active set algorithm, and fmincon interior point algorithm. OPF problem for the power system is defined as a large scale, highly constrained, non-linear, non-convex optimization problem. OPF problem solution targets to optimize the generation
,
,

cost as an objective function over optimal adjustment for control variables of power system, while satisfying different quality and inequality constraints. The equality constraints are the power flow equations, while the inequality constraints are the limits on the control variables ii.e. real power of generating units, generator bus voltages, reactive power of capacitor banks,. transformer tap settings : .. etc.) and operating limits of power system dependant variables,

A large size of power system is very expensive and could cost arou'1d 400,OOO$/km [5 -7] . Also, :nodelin g of a " Power System" is a comp! icated, challenging and difficult task.

The other model is the Economic Model/Structure in the market structure depending on the Independent System Operator . Independent System Operator (ISO) is responsible for controlling the "Power System Optimization" from the Energy Control Center (ECC) . The system operator (ISO) would like to minimize the total cost acquired to purchase the real power as required to serve the load(s) and supply for losses in the transmission system. ISO is the Electrical Engineer who is responsible in the Optimization of the Load Flow and minimizes the total cost in the Control Center [7, 8] .

Energy Control Center (ECC) role and responsibility emphasizing on safety, quality, reliability, and economy, are the key elements to control the operation of any electrical power system. The following tasks are performed to operate the power system with minimum generation cost and low transmission losses and to meet the criteria [8-10]: 1. Maintain the balance between load and generation . 2. 3. Maintain the reactive power balance in order to control the voltage profile. Maintain an optimum generation schedule to control the cost and environmental impact of the power generation. 4. Ensure the security of the network against reliable contingencies. This requires protecting the network against reasonable failure or shutdown of the power system. 5. Maintain all Controllable items: a) Generators b) Transmission System (TS) c) Distribution System (OS)

6. Person in-charge: "load Dispatcher" and "Independent System Operator (ISO)". 7. Schedules all the generating stations power output. 8. Controls other critical controls of the system like transformer taps setting, etc. 9. Monitors through a system called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). Takes corrective action as required. 10. Office is referred to as the Energy Control Center or Load Dispatch Center (LDC). In case the loads and networks configuration changed, the state of the power network will not change, which makes it more difficult to operate the power system. Also, the response of many power network machines is not prompt. That's why changing trends and growth have increased the need for computer-based operator support in interconnected power systems [8-10]. Two control centers are normally implemented in EEC are (EMS) for the operation of the generation-transmission system, and (OMS) for the operation of the distribution system, which is intended to help the dispatchers in monitoring and control of the system. The simplest of such systems perform the function of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition system) and others may have other sophisticated power application functions. The SCADA system accepts telemetered data and displays them to operators has an alarm management subsystem that monitors informs the operators of abnormal conditions [8-10]. Energy Management System (EMS) assists the operator (ISO) in monitoring and control of the electrical network with power application software and contains all the features of SCADA systems in data acquisition, control and monitoring. load management, loss minimization, peak shaving and load shifting are some important activities of EMS implemented (8). EMS and SCADA systems consist of a networked architecture of computers performing online computations with backup support. EMS functions can be categorized as base functions, generation functions, and network functions [8]. Market structures are essentially related to active power scheduling for the current practice in the day that ahead of energy market, defining the Unit Commitment (UC) of the generating units as well as the relevant dispatching that complying with transmission constraints [9, 10].

3. OPF Surveys
Comprehensive Surveys considered for a lot of papers in the field of optimal power flow (OPF). In this project, different approaches to solve the OPF problem for any power system were studied. Each technique and method will have its Pros and Cons. Optimization methods and techniques, which have been used in solving the OPF problems, have wide variety of techniques, such as Newton-Raphson (NR) based techniques [11, 12], interior point methods [13, 14], quadratic programming [15, 16], non-linear (NlP) programming [17-21], linear programming (lP) [22-24], sequential unconstrained minimization technique [25] and other different practical techniques of optimization from different surveys [26-29]. Effective OPF is limited first by the high dimensionality of power systems, and second by the incomplete domain dependent knowledge of power system engineers. The first limitation is addressed by numerical optimization procedures based on successive linearization using the first and the second derivatives of objective functions and their constraints as different searches directions or by linear programming solutions to imprecise models. From the practical methods of optimization was stated that the advantages of such methods are in their mathematical foundation, but disadvantages exist also in the sensitivity to problem formulation, algorithm selection and usually converge to local minima. The second limitation, incomplete domain knowledge, prevents also the reliable use of expert systems where rule completeness is not possible [4]. One of the Optimization methods is linear Programming (lP) and Non-linear Programming (NlP). LP and NLP offer a powerful technique to most of power system optimization problems by increasing the availability of high performance computers at relatively low costs [17-24]. On other hand, lP and NLP optimization technique solve global optimization searching problems by using Newton Raphson (NR) or Gauss-Seidel (GS) as well as lagrange's Function and multipliers (LF) in case of NLP [4]. Also, the application of the Lagrange's Approach could be utilized as an optimization algorithm for NLP in the Optimal Power Flow [27].

4. Wind Generation Technology in OPF
One of the most important challenges in the current and coming years is the optimization control, like the optimal power flow (OPF) including wind generation technology and with consideration of the wind generation cost [30-371. Dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) is "a typical complex, multi-constrained, non-convex, nonlinear programming problem in wind power integrated system" [371.

4.1. Green Energy Types:
There are different sources of Energy such as Fossil Fuels (Le. coal, Natural gas and diesel), Nuclear Power, Hydro Electric Power and the green power [30]. Also, there are a lot of comprehensive surveys in the Renewable Energy types as a green power generation. From the Wikipedia references, we could summarize the types of Green Energy as below: Green energy is created from natural resources that do not cause harmful pollution to Earth's surface or atmosphere. With the concern of global warming and reducing the natural resources, environmentally friendly alternatives are needed. Earth's sun, water and wind power have been used to operate machinery and generate power since ancient times. "The different types of green energy that are currently being considered as alternative sources of power could be described as below [301: 1. Hydropower converts water from rivers into usable energy released from turbines. Today, it is considered very expensive and difficult to build hydropower plants to produce mass amounts of electricity. There are also concerns that their usage may affect wildlife and change the quality of the water [30]. 2. Geothermal energy is produced from steam or hot water from under the Earth's surface. The steam powers electric generators by rotating turbines. One use for it is heating buildings. It is not widely available due to the lack of natural land sites. There are also concerns that geothermic fields may eventually reduce. It is a green energy due 8

to its low emissions. Its production is not affected by weather changes and can continuously work day and night. There are also some concerns about geothermal fields affecting the surrounding land's stability [30]. 3. Wind energy can be used to create energy by rotating large propellers like blades around a hub. The blades slow down the speed of the wind it captures and channels it to a generator that produces electricity. Wind energy usage worldwide is very small; the technology is expensive and its machinery is considered to be noisy. The energy it produces generates no pollution and has been used to power homes and farms
[3~).

4. Solar energy is another form of green energy. Photovoltaic cells can absorb light from the sun to capture electrons and use them to generate electricity. The sun has been used as a source of energy since ancient times. However, it is still considered to be expensive due the cost to produce the photovoltaic celled panels needed to generate energy. These types' panels are usually large and take up a lot of space. Solar energy is also inconsistent and needs a large surface area to generate enough electricity on a large scale. Solar energy is being used to power some homes, cars and in agriculture. 5. Hydrogen is another source of energy that is eco-friendly. It's a common element that can produce an unlimited amount of energy using water and electricity. Hydrogen was once thought to be too dangerous to work with, but it is now being considered as a source of fuel for vehicles. No emissions are created when used in its purest form. Only water is released as a result. It is expensive to produce and store. More research and time will be needed before it could be used on a worldwide scale" [30].

4.2. Cost Comparisons of Green Energy Supply Technologies:
It is well known that the conventional OPF problem only involved the thermal energy power sources [31]. However, with the introduction and development of the renewable energy sources specifically the wind energy [32] started the necessity to incorporate the wind generation cost into the classical OPF problem. Several of literature [31- 37] have been published in investigating the OPF problem with wind generation cost involved.

Generally, the Nuclear power energy has the most expensive total capital cost to establish a nuclear power plant as well as the most expensive operational costs comparing with other power generation plants. However, the net yearly cost (life/capital) including the yearly running cost could be considered as economic power generation unit comparing with some other conventional energy. On other hand, it was very clear that the green energy especially the wind generation is considered as economical cost generation, as shown in Fig.8.

Generally, one of the most important challenges in the current and coming years is the OPF including wind generation technology and the consideration of the wind generation cost in the OPF for the entire power system as in our case study. The wind generation cost based on the reference from the website of the cost comparisons of energy supply technologies, dated on April 28th, 2011 [38], is estimated as 0.14$/KWH for the production cost, as shown in Fig.9.

5. THEORY OF OPTIMAL POWER FLOW (OPF )
During the comprehensive surveys that considered a lot of papers in the field of optimal power flow (OPF). I have found that one of the best researchers that explained the OPF theory in a very organized way is Tarek BOUKTIR and Linda SUMANI [41, in addition to what learned during the course of Power System Optimization Course [7] and other survey papers in the field of OPF [11-29}. In this project, and from thoroughly study for different surveys, different approaches to solve the OPF problem for any power system were studied.

5.1. OPF Problem:
The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) has been usually considered as the minimization of an objective function representing the generation cost and/or the transmission losses. The constraints involved are the physical laws that leading the power generation and transmission systems, as well as the operating limitations of the entire power system and equipment [4-29].

5.2. OPF Solutions & Results:
Effective Optimal Power Flow is limited by the high dimensionality of power systems and the incomplete domain dependent knowledge of power system engineers. [4-29] A practical method is given for solving the Power Flow problem with control variables such as real and reactive power and transformer ratios automatically adjusted to minimize instantaneous costs or losses. The solution is feasible with respect to constraints on control variables and dependent variables such as load voltages, reactive sources, and tie line power angles. The method is based on power flow solution by Newton's (NR) method which modified to Fast Decoupled Power Flow (FDPF) as in the commercial use.

13

Due to its quadratic convergence, the NR method that have modified to Fast Decoupled Power Flow, has rapid convergence independent from system size. However, as the system size (number of equations) increases, the function evaluation at each iteration will be increased. Comparison between three different scenarios for our case study is done by using Fast Decoupled Power Flow (FDPF) with a result that shows the performance of FDPF. All results and data will be discussed later on in this project. Also, full study is done on our case study for three different scenarios for power load flow computation. The code can implement the Algorithm of the power load flow using the FDPF and find the maximum mismatch in the control variables of the real and reactive power for any number of buses that let the algorithm to converge. The challenge in algorithm development is to effiCiently identify the binding inequalities. This logarithmic corresponding to the original problem (OPF) is solved by the FDPF method. The advantages of such methods are in their mathematical foundation, but disadvantages exist also in the sensitivity to problem formulation, algorithm selection and usually converge to local minima. The second limitation, incomplete domain knowledge, prevents also the reliable use of expert systems where rule completeness is not possible. During the comprehensive survey in the OPF field and in the development and adaptive algorithms, some of the Optimization methods considered as a good optimization tools for the OPF such as Linear Programming (LP) and Non-Linear Programming (NLP). LP and NlP offer a powerful approach to these Optimization Problems made possible by the increasing availability of high performance computers at relatively low costs. Also, LP and NLP optimization technique solve global optimization searching problems by using Newton Raphson or Gauss-Seidel as well as lagrange's Function and multipliers in case of NlP. The controllable variables are decomposed to active constraints that effect directly the cost function are included in the NlP and passive constraints which are updating using a conventional load flow program, only, one time after the convergence. The slack bus parameter would be recalculated in the load flow process to take the effect of the passive constraints [4].

14

5.3. Problem Formulation:
The standard OPF problem can be written in the following form [1-381,

Minimize: F(x) Subject _ to : x tnin < x :::; x max
gj (x) = bjVi = 1,2 ... ME

(1)

h j (x) :::; c j Vi = 1,2 ...MI
where F(x) is the objective function, g(x) represents the equality constraints, h(x) represents the inequality constraints and is x is the vector of the control variables, that is those which can be varied by a Control Center Operator (e.g. generated active and reactive powers, generation bus voltage magnitudes, transformers taps etc.). The essence of the OPF problem resides in reducing the objective function and simultaneously satisfying the Load Flow Equations (equality constraints) without violating the (inequality constraints), which are the Physical System Limits at all generator buses and Operating System Limits at load buses [4].

5.4. Objective Function:
The most commonly used objective in the OPF problem formulation is the minimization of the total cost of real power generation. The individual costs of each generating unit are assumed to be function, only, of active power generation and are represented by quadratic curves of second order [4, 7]. The objective function for the entire power system can then be written as the sum of the quadratic cost model at each generator:
NG NG
j

F(x)

= CPTotal = IC~ = I(a
j=! j=l

+bj.Pg j +c j .Pg j

2 )

(2)

Where: NG is number of generation including the slack bus. Pgi is the generated active power at bus-i. ai, bi and ci are the unit costs curve for ith generator.

15

5.5. Types of Equality Constraints:
While minimizing the cost function, it is necessary to make sure that the generation still supplies the "load demands (Pd) plus losses in transmission lines equations are used as equality constraints:
ll ·

Usually the Power Flow

(3)

Where Active and Reactive Power injection at (bus i) are defined in the following equation:
N

F;(V,B) = V; *::L[VjY;j *COS(Oi -OJ -Bij)]
j=1

N

Qi(V,B) = V; *::L[VjY;j *sin(oi -OJ -Bij)]
j=l

(4a)

NB

'p;(V,O) == 2:Vi,Vj'(gif cosOif +bif sinBif ),i = 2,NB
j=1

Qj(V,B) = 2:V;,Vj'(gif sin0if -bif cos Bif),i
j=i

NB

(4b)

=NPV + I,NB

Where: Yij is the Bus Admittance gij is the Conductance, and bij is the Susceptance Vi is voltage magnitude at the bus i and

e ij is the bus voltage phase angle.

The real power balance and reactive power balance are the most important in OPF and they considered as Equality Constraints [7].

5.6. Types of Inequality Constraints:
The inequality constraints of the OPF reflect the limits on physical devices in the power system and the operating limits created to ensure system security. The most usual types of inequality

16

constraints are upper bus voltage limits at generations and load buses, lower bus voltage limits at load buses, var. limits at generation buses, maximum active power limits corresponding to lower limits at some generators, maximum line loading limits and limits on tap setting and phase shifter. The inequality constraints on the problem variables considered include [4, 7]: · Upper and lower bounds on the active generations (Real Power) at generator buses: Pgi min::; Pgi ::; Pgi max, where (i = 1, NG)

(5)

· Upper and lower bounds on the (Reactive Power) generations at generator buses and reactive power injection at buses with VAR compensation: Qgi min::; Qgi::; Qgi max, where (i = 1, NPV) · Upper and lower bounds on the voltage magnitude at the all buses: Vi min::; Vi ::; Vi max, where (i = 1, NB) · Upper and lower bounds on the bus voltage phase angles: 8i min::; 8i ::; 8i max, where (i = 1, NB)

(6)

(7)

(8)

- · Upper and lower bounds on branch MW/MVAR/MVA flows may come from thermal ratings of conductors, or they may be set to a level due to system stability concerns:

(9)
Finally, the generalized objective function F is a non-linear, and the number of the equality and inequality constraints increase with the physical size of the power distribution systems. Different applications of a conventional optimization technique such as the gradient-based algorithms to a large power distribution system with a very non-linear objective functions and great number of constraints are not good enough to solve this OPF problem. Because it depend on the existence of the first and the second derivatives of the objective function and on the well computing of these derivative in large search space [4].

6. Project Case Study Using OPF Methodology
6.1. Discussion and Theory:
In this project the most optimal solution of optimal power flow (OPF) incorporating wind generation cost was studied, to supply power to a new residential compound load located at the outskirts of an industrial area for three different scenarios. This domestic load is typical of long rural line with isolated load area. An interconnected network is generally found in more industrial or urban areas and would have almost multiple connections to other power supply. The benefit of interconnected model is that in case of a fault and/or maintenance a small area of network would be isolated and the rest kept on supply. This represent the scenario one of our case study to feed both the industrial area as well as the long rural line domestic load in the village. However, the challenging in our case study that we have to incorporate a wind generation unit as one type of green energy, that are currently being considered as an alternative source of power, to feed this long rural line for the domestic load without effecting in the total generation cost. A case study conducted for three different scenarios incorporating wind generation cost to feed this long rural line for the domestic load. The results of OPF shows that incorporating wind generation cost as renewable energy source with the entire power system will have a minimum generation cost and minimum transmission losses even if the wind generation cost assumed to be the most expensive one comparing with other conventional generation units. In this project, it's succeeded to have the required code to implement the Algorithm of the Power Flow using the FOPF and find the maximum mismatch of the real and reactive power for any number of buses and let the algorithm to converge. This program succeeded to optimize the best solution for three different scenarios by using (fmincon) as one of optimization tools to achieve the minimum total cost function of generating units and minimum transmission losses.

18

ISO would like to minimize the total cost incurred to purchase real power as required to serve the load(s) and supply for losses in the transmission system. This solution must satisfy physical and operational criteria as set by physical characteristics and the law of the land. The variables at hand and segregate them as those that we may wish to control (control variables) and those that assume values as a result of settings of the control variables and the physical system (dependent variables). List of variables: PG - Real power output of generators QG - Reactive power output of generators VG - Magnitude of Voltages set at the terminals of generators Vl- Magnitude of Voltages set at load buses {) - Phase angles of all Bus voltages phasors List of constraints characterizing the physical system and loads: · (r, x, zl, yl and V) - Transmission line resistance, inductive reactance, complex impedance, and complex admittance and shunt line charging capacitive admittance. · · (VB): System Admittance matrix in the bus frame of reference (complex). (PO, QO) - Real and Reactive power drawn at buses by connected loads.

Now, from the above, we could identify the objective and constraints: Objective Function: The cost of real power from the ith generator is specified as: CPi = l:(ai + bi . PGi + ci . PGi2} ;
(10)

The total cost incurred by the system operator at the energy control centre would be equal to: CP

=l: CPi =l:i (ai + bi . PGi + ci . PGi2)

(11)

So, the objective of the problem would then be: Minimize: CP Constraints Power Balance Transmission System Constraints at every Bus: PGi - POi - Pi (V, 0)

6.2. PROJECT PROPOSAL (CASE STUDY):
Selecting the most optimal way (OPF) to supply power to a new residential compound load located at the outskirts of an industrial area. The area is settled for three big

industrial facilities with a bulky load supplied by two generation stations, one from the north (low generation cost) and the other one in the south (high generation cost) of the industrial area. Now, the industrial area authority decided to build a new village far from the industrial area to the south west direction. Also, a transmission line will be built to connect the industrial area and residential village (compound) with a fixed capital cost.

This project is studying three (3) different scenarios:

in Fig.10. The project studying how to optimize the load sharing between the two generators with consideration that the nearest one to the Village has (high Generation Cost but with less power losses) and the other far one has (low Generation Cost but with more power losses) in the transmission system.

Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem was solved in this project by using MATlAB optimization method and technique on computer. The toolbox (fmincon) has become standard practice to solve a lot of optimization problems. This toolbox from MATlAB has three algorithms, with . several options for Hessians, including fmincon trust region reflective algorithm, fmincon active set algorithm, and fmincon interior point algorithm. The Project used fmincon Optimization Toolbox from the MATLAB to optimize the objective function which is the total generation cost. It was clear that the power transmission losses will account for more Power generation cost. The constraints and the bounds of the optimization problem were the normal physical limits for operating any power system. All the test results of the three different scenarios are attached in the Appendix for the minimum generation cost and transmission losses for the entire power system.

7. Conclusion and Future Work
The OPF problem is the Optimal Power Flow for a power system operation with an objective function, Total Generation Cost, is optimized while satisfying set of system operating constraints. OPF has been widely used in power system operation and load flow planning. The OPF is a nonlinear, non-convex, large-scale, static optimization problem with both continuous and discrete control variables. Mathematical programming approaches, such as linear, and nonlinear programming, and interior point methods have been used for the solution of the OPF problem. The challenging was in our case study to incorporate a wind generation unit as one type of green energy, to feed this long rural line for the domestic load without effecting in the total generation cost. A case study conducted as per the achieved results mentioned above, for a" the three different scenarios incorporating wind generation cost. The results of OPF shows that incorporating wind generation unit as renewable energy source with the entire power system will have a minimum generation cost and minimum transmission losses for the entire power system even if the wind generation cost assumed to be the most expensive one comparing with other conventional generation units. One of the most important challenges in the current and coming years is the optimal power flow (OPF) with consideration of the wind generation cost. The wind generation is considered as dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) which is a typical complex, multi-constrained, nonconvex, non-linear programming problem. Green Energy is created from natural resources that do not cause harmful pollution to Earth's surface or atmosphere. With the concern of global warming and reducing the natural resources, environmentally friendly alternatives are needed. The different types of green energy that are currently being considered as alternative sources of power could be studied in the future work

26

with consideration of the generation cost and its effect on the OPF of the entire power system. That's why; there are a lot of challenges of adhering standards, technology and cost challenges. Using Genetic Algorithms (GA) as another MATLAB optimization toolbox in the future works for the same case study with all different scenarios may be could achieve better results than fmincon toolbox. The application of genetic algorithms (GA) in solving the OPF problem, overcomes the limitations of the conventional approaches in the modeling of non-convex cost functions, discrete control variables (such as switchable shunt devices, transformer tap positions, and phase shifters, further complicates the problem solution.), and prohibited unit operating zones. GA has been developed as a biological approach to search and optimization. They consist of a population of bit strings transformed by three genetic operators: selection, crossover and mutation. Each string (chromosome) represents a possible solution for the problem being optimized and each bit (or group of bits) represents a value for some variable of the problem (gene). These solutions are classified by an evaluation function, giving better values, or fitness, to better solutions . . There are a lot of well-known features of GA as an optimization tool for solving OPF problems: 1. GA does not require "well behaved" objective functions and allow simple handling of discontinuities and non-linearity, which are hard to include in pure mathematical programming methods. 2. Using GA will not obtain only one "Optimal solution, but a large group of solutions 3. GA is well adapted for distributed implementations, allowing computation time to be drastically reduced. The test results in the existing GA-OPF models are limited to small problems, and usually simple fast decoupled load flow (FOLF) is used with no PV-PQ bustype switching, since generator reactive capabilities are incorporated in the functional operating constraints.

Compare between the proposals using these values. The results was showing that the generation cost of proposal 3 (Scenario-3) is the lowest cost (S/MW) and lowest transmission losses.

1.1 How Program Work (Brief Write-up):
The Programs (Proj.m) and (Proj2.m) will read input data from the input data files of the proposals of the different systems, then build the (Admittance Matrix) and the (S' and S" Matrices) for these systems. Proj1.m will work for the proposals (1 and 3) by running the Load Flow algorithm using the Fast Decoupled load Flow (FDLF) Algorithm. This will generate initial conditions for the Optimization process to start with. Proj2.m will work for proposal 2 and it will not run the load Flow Algorithm as the system will then contain two isolated islands and values of unity will be assigned to load Voltage

32

Magnitudes and values of zero will be assigned to Voltage Angles, Real Power and Reactive Power initially. Consequently it will not contain parts 6 and 7. Then both programs will execute part_8 by running the Optimization using the (fmincon) function which applies non-linear constrained optimization. In this part upper and lower bounds for the Variables. An external function called (Constraints.m) will be used to apply the non-linear constraints for the Power Balance Equations. After that the Transmission line Flows will be done and the Output files will be created containing all the calculations for the system including the Transmission losses and the Total Generation Cost.
