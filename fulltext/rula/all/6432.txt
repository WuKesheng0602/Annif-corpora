Foreword
Today, billions of people around the world are turning to social media to socialize, conduct business, keep up with the news, as well as discover, discuss, and share information. The significance of this global adoption of a relatively new communication and information technology cannot be overlooked. As a country, Canada has one of the most connected populations in the world. For many Canadians, social media is now a part of their daily routine. Our survey results show that an overwhelming majority of online Canadian adults (94%) have an account on at least one social media platform. This makes it critical for policy makers, researchers, and others to have a better grasp of what social media platforms Canadians are using to connect and converse with one another. This report provides a snapshot of the social media usage trends and patterns amongst online Canadian adults based on an online survey of 1,500 participants (see Methods on p. 16 for more details). ·

Facebook
Facebook dominates the social media landscape; 84% of online Canadian adults report having a Facebook account making it the most widely adopted platform in Canada. Beyond adoption, Canadians are also the most active on this platform with 80% of people being Monthly Active Users (MAU). Women (88%) are more likely to use Facebook than men (81%). Facebook adoption is almost ubiquitous with young people aged 18­24 (95%); three-quarters of those 55+ years old (75%) are also on Facebook. In fact, this is the only platform where the oldest generation crosses the 50% adoption and monthly usage mark. Facebook adoption is consistently high across all income groups--ranging from 80% to 88%. Those with the least education (75%) are less likely to be on Facebook. Canadians who are not employed (77%) have the lowest adoption, whereas those who work full-time (90%) have the highest adoption of Facebook.

YouTube
YouTube is the second most popular social media platform in Canada; 59% of online adults report having an account on the platform. Canadians are active users of the video-sharing platform with the majority of users being Monthly Active Users (54%). Aside from Facebook, this is the only platform where the MAU is above 50%. Unlike Facebook, men (62%) are more likely to have an account on YouTube than women (55%). There is a large distribution of use across the age groups, but adoption lowers with age; 41% of those 55+ have a YouTube account. 90% of young people aged 18­24 have an account on YouTube and almost the same percentage use the platform at least monthly (88%). YouTube adoption is relatively consistent across income groups-- ranging from 55% of those who have an annual household income of $100,000­$119,999 to 65% of those in the lowest income group. Those with the lowest education (46%) and those not employed (49%) are least likely to have a YouTube account.

LinkedIn
LinkedIn is the third most popular social media platform in Canada; 46% of online adults report having an account on the platform. Almost half of the men (49%) surveyed have a LinkedIn account, whereas women (44%) are slightly less likely to have an account. LinkedIn adoption is quite high across age groups, but those in the oldest age group of 55+ (43%) and youngest age group of 18­24 year olds (40%) have the lowest adoption rates. Generally, the higher the level of education, the higher the LinkedIn adoption. High school graduates (21%) have the lowest LinkedIn adoption, and individuals with a professional degree (69%) have the highest adoption. LinkedIn is particularly popular with those who are self-employed (56%). In fact, this is the only platform where people who are self-employed comprise the highest user group, which makes sense considering that LinkedIn is a business- and employment-related social media platform.

Twitter
Twitter is the fourth most popular social media platform in Canada; 42% of online adults report having an account on the platform. Men and women have similar adoption rates of Twitter; women (43%) are slightly more likely than men (40%) to have a Twitter account, but men are slightly more active users (33% being Monthly Active Users) versus women (31% being Monthly Active Users). Older people are the least likely to adopt Twitter; only 27% of those 55+ have a Twitter account. Young people aged 18­24 (60%) and 25­34 (59%) are the most prevalent user groups on Twitter. Like LinkedIn, the wealthiest Canadians are more likely to adopt Twitter; 46% of those with an annual household income of $120,000+ have a Twitter account. Individuals with doctorates (33%) have the lowest adoption rate of Twitter. Almost half of full-time workers (49%) have a Twitter account, dropping to roughly a third amongst those who are not employed (31%).

Pinterest
38% of online Canadians report having a Pinterest account. Of all social media platforms, Pinterest has the largest adoption difference between men (18%) and women (56%). Even though Pinterest is the fifth most popular platform for Canadians, it is the second most popular platform for online Canadian women with only Facebook having higher adoption. Online adults aged 25­34 are the most prevalent user group on Pinterest with an adoption rate of 54%, while those 55+ are less likely to be on Pinterest with an adoption rate of 30%. Except for Canadians in the highest household income group, Pinterest adoption tends to increase with annual household income. Based on education, a bell curve shape emerges with the highest rate of adoption amongst those who report having some college (39%), college diploma (42%), and bachelor's (39%). Like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, Canadians that are self-employed (28%) and not employed (34%) have the lowest Pinterest adoption.

Instagram
As the sixth most popular social media platform in Canada, 37% of online Canadians report having an Instagram account. Women (46%) are on Instagram at a much higher rate than men (28%). Those with an Instagram account are active users with comparatively high Monthly Active Users across all demographic groups. The youngest age group of 18­24 year olds (67%) dominates Instagram, and high levels of adoption can also be found in the 25­34 year old group (62%). Almost half of Canadians with a Professional degree (47%) have an Instagram account. Those who work full-time (46%) are almost twice as likely to have an Instagram account than those not employed (24%).

Snapchat
Roughly one quarter of online Canadians (22%) report having a Snapchat account. Like Instagram and Pinterest, women (28%) are more likely to adopt Snapchat than men (16%). Young people 18­24 years old (66%) and 25­34 years old (46%) are the largest user groups on the platform. They are also active on the platform with 62% and 39% being Monthly Active Users, respectively. Adoption is relatively consistent across income groups--ranging from 19% to 26%. Snapchat adoption does not follow a predictable pattern in terms of education--ranging from 11% amongst those with a doctorate to 26% amongst those with a bachelor's. There is a large difference in adoption rates between those who work full-time (29%) or part-time (29%) and those who are self-employed (10%) or not employed (13%).

Tumblr
Roughly one-in-ten online Canadian adults (11%) report having a Tumblr account. Women (13%) are slightly more likely than men (7%) to be on Tumblr. 18­24 year olds (36%) are almost twice as likely to adopt the platform as 25­34 year olds (17%); Tumblr adoption drops to 10% or below for those 35 years old and older. Tumblr is most popular amongst those in the lowest household income group (16%). In comparison, those who earn $100,000­$119,00 (8%) and $120,000+ (8%) are half as likely to have a Tumblr account. People who work part-time (20%) are more likely to be on Tumblr than those who work full-time (12%), are selfemployed (3%), or are not employed (8%). Tumblr is the only platform where adoption is higher amongst parttime workers than full-time workers.

Reddit
Less than one-in-ten online Canadian adults (9%) are on Reddit. Of the nine social media platforms detailed in this research, Reddit has the smallest population of users--meaning the platform remains niche in use across Canadian demographic groups. 10% of men and 8% of women report having a Reddit account. Reddit's users are largely comprised of young people. Over one-quarter of young people aged 18­24 (28%) have a Reddit account with the adoption rate dramatically dropping in the older age groups (only 2% amongst those 55+). Reddit users are relatively equally distributed across income groups with slightly higher adoption rates in the higher income groups. 11% of those with $120,000+ annual household income have a Reddit account; those with less than $20,000 annual household income have the lowest adoption (3%). Canadians who are employed full-time (12%) or part-time (11%) are more than twice as likely to adopt Reddit as those self-employed (5%) or not employed (5%).

Methods
Data was collected using a market research data company, Research Now, for panel recruitment. The survey was open from June 1 to July 15, 2017 and was hosted by Qualtrics. We received a total of 1,500 completed responses after data cleaning. The survey was made available to online Canadian adults in French and English. The term "online Canadian adults" refers to Internet users aged 18 and older. To increase the representativeness of the data, we used quota sampling by age, gender, and geographical region to match the distributions in the 2016 Statistics Canada Census2. We recognize gender is not binary; however, the sampling question was phrased to be in line with Statistics Canada for recruiting a representative sample of adult Canadians. Later in the survey, participants were invited to self-identify as "trans*, non-binary, two-spirit, genderqueer, or other" and 0.8% (12 people) did. Considering the small and non-representative sample of this group, the gender-based distributions are only reported based on the counts of participants who selfidentified as female or male. Four respondents were excluded from the demographic-based counts due to their incomplete demographic data.

Ethics
The data is anonymized and presented in aggregate in this report. Prior to data collection, Research Ethics Board approval was obtained from two Canadian universities. Participants were shown a comprehensive consent form. Participants were offered eRewards for completing the survey, which can be transferred to various loyalty rewards programs.

Unfortunately, Research Now does not have panel survey participants from Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.

Reporting
The report is primarily based on two statistics: adoption rate as measured by the percentage of participants with a social media account, and usage rate as measured by the percentage of Monthly Active Users (MAU). All percentages are rounded to the nearest 1%. Income is reported as the annual household income.

Survey Questions
