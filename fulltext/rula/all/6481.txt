Abstract BIOACTIVE COATINGS FOR DIRECT SKELETAL ATTACHMENT APPLICATIONS FOR LOWER LIMB PROSTHESES Doctor of Philosophy, 2017 Omar Rodríguez Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering Faculty of Engineering & Architectural Science, Ryerson University To tackle the current drawbacks with metallic implants used in direct skeletal attachment, novel bioactive glasses are considered as implant coatings in order to reduce bacterial infections and promote bone cell growth. Silica-based and borate-based glasses, with increasing amounts of titanium dioxide at the expense of either silica (for the silica-based glasses) or borate (for the borate-based glasses), respectively, were synthesized and characterized to determine the parameters that define a glass capable of inhibiting bacterial growth, stimulating cell proliferation and offering mechanical stability when enameled into a surgical alloy. The effect of substituting the glass backbone with titanium dioxide, in both glass series, is also investigated with respect to its effect on both biocompatibility and mechanical properties of the resultant glass/implant constructs. Borate-based glasses exhibited greater processing windows compared to the silica-based glasses, making them more desirable for coating applications. They also exhibited superior performance in terms of their in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility, over their silica-based counterparts, due to their higher solubility and greater ability to inhibit S. epidermidis and E. coli bacteria. Specifically, glass BRT0 (control borate-based glass, with no titanium incorporated) exhibited an inhibition zone against S. epidermidis of 17.5 mm and a mass loss of 40% after 30 days, with BRT3 (borate-based glass, with 15 mol% titanium incorporated) exhibiting an

inhibition zone against S. epidermidis of 7.6 mm and a mass loss of 34% after 30 days. Furthermore, borate-based glasses with greater titanium dioxide contents exhibited superior mechanical properties (e.g. bulk hardness, and critical strain energy release rates), which could be attributed to their more closely matched coefficients of thermal expansion with the titanium alloy substrate, Ti6Al4V, to which they were adhered. The critical strain energy release rates in mode I for the silica-based coating/substrate system ranged from 6.2 J/m2 (for SRT0, control silica-based glass with no titanium) to 12.08 J/m2 (for SRT3), whereas for the borate-based systems they ranged from 10.86 J/m2 (for BRT0) to 18.5 J/m2 (for BRT3), with the increase for the borate-based glasses being attributed to the presence of compressive residual stresses in the coating after application.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background
In the field of prosthetics, two technologies for attaching the residual limb and the prosthetic implant are widely utilized: socket attachment and direct skeletal (or bone-anchored) attachment [1]. Socket attachment is the most common method [2], with designs already established for below, through or above-knee amputations [3, 4, 5, 6]. In general, socket attachment consists of wrapping the prosthetic limb around the residual limb, with the prosthesis serving as the socket for the residual limb, with quadrilateral and ischial containment sockets being the most noteworthy technologies [7]. Compared to socket attachment, direct skeletal attachment (DSA) is a relatively new technology, where an implant is attached directly to the patient's bone at the residual limb. Upon healing, the implant in DSA serves as the attachment mechanism between the prosthesis and the body [1]. In achieving osseointegration, the implant is permanently connected to the bone, resulting in high force and moment interaction between the prosthesis and the body [8]. DSA technology offers an advantage over socket technology through a reduction in skin-related complications and residual limb constraints within the socket, as a result of the limited direct contact between the prosthetic implant and the skin [9].

Figure 1.1. Socket attachment [10] (left) and direct skeletal attachment [11] (right) representations. 2

Titanium has become one of the preferred implant materials due to its ability to create a permanent bond to bone via osseointegration [12, 13]. It is this characteristic that has also made DSA devices more favorable than socket attachments for prosthetics. However, there are concerns regarding DSA including potential infection, skin irritation and breakdown, implant failure and risk of a broken bone in the residual limb [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Addressing these concerns will aid in shifting the current paradigm from socket attachment towards DSA. It is important to understand the overall mechanics of the DSA system, as loads that may negatively affect the residual limb bone may occur in this situation [18]. This places a patient at risk of requiring additional treatment if the bone weakens or fractures due to incomplete osseointegration or to detrimental bone remodeling induced by stress shielding [19]. Different approaches have been taken toward improving the patient's experience with DSA, including modifying the implant surface by chemical etching with hydrochloric and/or sulfuric acid, sandblasting, titanium plasma-spraying, hydroxylapatite (HA) plasma-spraying or coating the implant with either a titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer through anodic oxidation or with a bioactive glass [9, 20, 21, 22]. HA coatings have been used for over 20 years in such applications, exploiting its ability to promote bone ingrowth [23, 24, 25]; yet there are concerns with HA use as it has no mechanism to retard bacterial or biofilm colonization at the implant site. Coatings have also been produced based on chlorhexidine and silicone with ammonia couplings [26, 27], but these have little clinical applicability due to erosion of the compounds as they migrate to the surface. Of all the approaches above, coating with bioactive glasses have showed encouraging results [20]. The use of bioactive materials in orthopedic surgery has proliferated since the development of Hench's 45S5 Bioglass® in the 1960s [28] due to its favorable interaction with

3

living tissue. Bioglass® was the first synthetic material to chemically adhere to both hard and soft tissue [28]. Although Hench acknowledged that Bioglass® is unsuitable as a coating [29], he developed criteria for an optimal bone replacement material [30], which included that "the material should resorb at the same rate that bone is regenerated, with byproducts that are beneficial and easily excreted by the body so that bone will restore to a healthy state".

1.2. Motivation
DSA has been evaluated versus socket attachment to assess the feasibility of these two technologies, concluding that DSA provides the amputees with a better overall experience [2]. Hagberg et al. compared the hip range of motion for two groups of patients: those with socket prostheses (43 patients (32 male subjects), with an average age of 51 years) and those with boneanchored prostheses (20 patients (15 male subjects), with an average age of 46 years). 37% (16) of the patients with socket prostheses experienced restricted hip motion in all directions, and 44% (19) from the same group expressed discomfort while sitting. No patient using boneanchored prostheses experienced restricted hip motion, nor did they express discomfort while sitting. These results evidence the advantage of DSA over socket attachment, providing a justification to further improve on this technology. As bioactive glasses influence genetic expression, differentiation and cell proliferation by the release of ions [31, 32, 33, 34], engineering control of the biological response via dissolution products creates an opportunity for innovation. The proposed compositions are expected to provide superior performance as they are expected to inhibit bacterial growth due to the addition of zinc, while the absence of aluminum minimizes the possibility of the coating causing toxicity

4

in surrounding tissues. Furthermore, incorporating titanium in the glass compositions is expected to enhance osseointegration [12, 13, 35]. Furthermore, evaluating the ability of using borate-based bioactive glasses for coating purposes will tackle the fact that silicate-based glasses possess a significantly different coefficient of thermal expansion compared to metallic implants (e.g. Ti6Al4V, with 10.6x10-6/°C in the range of 0-650°C [36] versus 45S5, with 17.0x10-6/°C, in the range of 0-500°C [37], ~60% difference), which plays a detrimental role as the coating fissures around the implant due to the mismatch in contraction when the coating/implant assembly is taken from the high coating temperatures to room temperature.

1.3. Literature Review 1.3.1. Osseointegration and Osseoperception
Titanium has facilitated the securing of implants into the maxilla and mandible by stimulating direct bone apposition to the implant surface [38]. Denser bones, such as the anterior mandible, exhibit better osseointegration than less dense bones, such as the posterior maxilla [39], given that denser bones provide greater bone/implant interface area [38]. At the beginning of the 1950s, Leventhal tested the fixation of titanium screws into the femora of rats [40]. He described how the screws were progressively more attached to the bone, until such a point that the screws were so firmly attached that attempting to remove them resulted in breaking the femur. This was the first indication of the osseointegrative behavior of titanium. Towards the end of the 1950s, researchers evaluated the process for modifying a rabbit's ear chamber, by attaching a titanium implant with central canal and transverse opening to the ear bone, allowing for the bone and vessels to grow into the chamber [41]. Upon experiencing the 5

successful integration of these elements, the researchers expanded to test with dental prostheses, which further proved the reliability of titanium-based implants. Patients with osseointegrated implants have also exhibited what has been termed osseoperception; the capacity to identify tactile thresholds transmitted through the prostheses [12]; this was first observed on dental implant patients who demonstrated a level of functional capacity equal to that of individuals with reduced dentition of the same extension as in the osseointegration group [42]. A study was performed to evaluate the level of osseoperception between patients with osseointegrated prostheses and those with socket-attached prostheses [43]. Testing was performed on 13 patients with transfemoral, transtibial, transradial and transhumeral prostheses, where test patients with same gender and similar age and amputation levels were compared across the two groups. The study consisted of applying small vibrations to different fingers or toes, as applicable, and testing the perception of the patient to the stimuli. It was concluded that patients with osseointegrated prostheses were able to reliably detect vibration pulses through their prostheses, whereas socket prostheses users did not exhibit this ability. Beneficial as the osseointegration process appears to be, it is worth noting that applications requiring only temporary fixation should avoid the use of titanium, since it may require fracturing the bone to which it is attached during the removal process. In prosthetics, this may seldom be the case; however, precautions have to be taken during the design of the implant and its attachment as improper design may result in discomfort for the amputee, requiring the change or removal of the overall prosthesis, which may pose complexity if an osseointegrated prosthesis was used.

1.3.2. Metal Coating and Adhesion Measurement
Coatings can enhance a metal's ability to resist corrosion and wear, and to increase their adhesion and wettability. Metals have been determined suitable as implants due to their mechanical properties, though they can be rejected by the body due to unwanted chemical reactions at the interface between the metal and living tissue. For this reason, an additional property is required for these coatings: that they serve as a suitable biological interface between implant and tissue. Ceramics and glasses have been developed for the purpose of providing a barrier for the implant against bacterial colonization. Several practical coating methods will be discussed, focusing on their suitability for steel, titanium and titanium alloys. Of the accepted coating techniques, enameling is one of the most widely used. Chen et al. [44] described the coating of 1Cr11Ni2W2MoV martensitic stainless steel samples with an ethanol-based suspension of SiO2-Al2O3-ZnO-CaO-ZrO2-TiO2-B2O3-Na2O-KNO3 glass. The suspension was sprayed on to the steel samples at room temperature, then dried at 250°C for 15 mins. Ultimately, the assembly was heat-treated at 870°C for 3 min, the temperature being sufficiently higher than the softening point to allow for the coating to flow on the substrate. The authors observed that low firing temperatures and short sintering times did not help the glass to spread along the substrate, resulting in a porous coat. The enameling technique with an ethanol-based suspension applied to titanium alloy Ti6Al4V has also been investigated by Pavon et al. [45]. The authors used two glass formulations based on the composition SiO2-CaO-Na2O-MgO-P2O5-K2O, with SiO2 contents of 61.1 mol% and 64.1 mol%, to evaluate their effectiveness as coating materials. The substrates were polished with diamond paste then ultrasonically cleaned in an acetone-ethanol bath. Upon application of the suspension on the substrates, the assemblies were air-dried at 75°C overnight,

7

fired at temperatures ranging from 800°C to 820°C, and quenched in air. The glass coating with 61.1 mol% of SiO2 exhibited higher stress distribution compared to the 64.1 mol% formulation, which the authors attributed to a greater thermal expansion mismatch between the glass and the substrate. Lotfibakhshaiesh et al. [46] evaluated a different glass formulation (SiO2-P2O5-CaOSrO-Na2O-K2O-MgO-ZnO, changing the molecular percentage of calcium and strontium oxide) for coating Ti6Al4V through an analogous process to that of Pavon et al. [45], with the exception that the firing environment used by Pavon et al. was air, whereas Lotfibakhshaiesh et al. used a vacuum environment. Successful coating was reported by Lotfibakhshaiesh et al., proving that complete substitution of calcium oxide for strontium oxide favors crystallization due to a smaller processing window. Enameling techniques have also been investigated using isopropanol instead of ethanol. Sola et al. [47] tested bioactive glass compositions (Na2O-K2O-CaO-P2O5-SiO2) suspended in isopropanol and then deposited on Ti6Al4V substrates. The authors investigated different heating profiles to determine the best coating process, using a temperature ramp to heat up the samples and including an isothermal stage for 1 hr at the maximum temperature, as this overall heating schedule allowed for optimum coverage. Mehdipoura et al. [48] evaluated the effect of different processing parameters during electrophoretic deposition of a SiO2­P2O5­CaO­MgO glass on to 316L stainless steel. Prior to coating, the steel substrates were washed with distilled water, rinsed, then degreased by ultrasonic cleaning in acetone for 10 min, and then dried. A triethanolamine-ethanol-glass suspension was elaborated, then by means of electrophoretic deposition, applied to the substrate at constant voltages of 30 Vcm-2, 60 Vcm-2 and 90 Vcm-2. Adhesion was enhanced by sintering

8

the assembly at 800°C. It was determined that porosity and surface cracks increased with processing voltage, with the best coating quality achieved at 30 Vcm-2. Schrooten and Helsen [49] used a reactive plasma spraying technique for coating Ti6Al4V titanium alloy with a SiO2-Na2O-P2O5-CaF2 glass. The substrates were coated with a 50µm-layer of the bioactive glass. Substrate-coat adhesion was measured, and found to be sufficient for load-bearing applications (greater than 48 MPa in shear and greater than 84 MPa in tension). The authors found that adhesion strength was dependent upon the inherent strength of the glass itself: a higher strength bioactive glass was more strongly bonded to the titanium alloy. In order to measure adhesion, indentation-based measurement methods allow a quick and qualitative measurement [37, 50, 51, 52] . Such tests can quantify fracture toughness of the material by the direct measurements of cracking after indentation [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. A common example is the Vickers indentation fracture (VIF) test, which measures the lengths of the cracks emanating from the indents. This technique was first developed by Lawn et al. [53], under the assumption that such cracks were created due to tensile stresses that form during unloading. Anstis et al. [54] validated Lawn's model for several ceramics and glasses by comparing the fracture toughness obtained from the VIF test with the ones obtained from standard fracture tests. Later, Laugier [59] showed that indentation crack geometry in glasses and ceramics were different and claimed that Lawn's model required modification when used for evaluating ceramic toughness, and therefore developed a new model that described the indentation cracking in ceramics more realistically.

1.3.3. Bioactive Glasses for Coatings and Rationale for Proposed Formulations
The potential of bioactive glasses in coating applications was first postulated with the development of Hench's 45S5 Bioglass® in the 1960s [28]. Bioglass® was the first synthetic material to chemically adhere to both hard and soft tissue [28]. In situ degradation of such materials makes them desirable for clinical applications owing to the release of ions into the physiological environment, which can promote antibacterial behavior, bone formation and growth, and tissue healing [31, 60, 61]. Although bioactive glasses have been employed for coating metals [44, 47, 37, 62], these compositions have all, to date, contained aluminum [44, 37], which is associated with defective bone mineralization and neurotoxicity [63]. Other compositions have been deficient in zinc [47, 62, 37], an antibacterial component [60, 64, 65] known to aid the healing process by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, including caries-related bacteria Streptococcus mutans [66]. Although virtually all materials facilitate bacterial ingress which can lead to biofilm formation, bacteria attach less readily to glass [67], providing a rationale for a glass-based solution to bacterial colonization of surgical implants. The current dissertation considers two distinct glass series, one based on silica (SiO2) and one on borate (B2O3), with increasing amounts of titanium dioxide (TiO2) incorporated at the expense of the silicate or borate component, respectively. B2O3 has been shown to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of glasses [68] so that borate glasses have CTEs closer to that of the surgical metals (typically Ti6Al4V, with a CTE of 9.5x10-6/°C in the range of 0315°C [69]). Processing such glasses for coating applications (e.g., through enameling [47, 70], plasma spraying [49] or electrophoretic deposition [48]) requires heat treatment at temperatures high enough to allow for the glass to react with the substrate surface thus creating a chemical 10

bond [71, 72]. Once the bond has formed and the assembly is cooled, the difference in CTE between the glass and metal will induce residual stresses, causing cracks to appear in the glass or at the glass/substrate interface. For this reason, a borate-based glass series is proposed, to evaluate the effect of B2O3 on its coating capability by means of a reduced CTE compared to silica-based glasses, which means that residual stresses at the glass-substrate interface would be reduced since both components would be subjected to comparable amounts of shrinkage during the cool off stage of enameling. A silica-based glass series is also proposed, with a composition analogous to that of the borate-based glass series, to allow for the evaluation of the effect of B2O3 versus SiO2 on resultant properties of the coating. Additionally, TiO2 is incorporated in these glasses as it helps promote a more stable chemical bond when coating such a glass onto Ti6Al4V [68]. Titanium has also been incorporated in bioactive glasses: for phosphate glasses, the addition of TiO2 has been associated with an increase in the crystallization temperature due to titanium acting as a network former with Ti4+ crosslinking phosphate units in these glasses and therefore impending crystallization [73]; in silicate glasses, TiO2 has been shown to enter the glass network as a glass modifier by increasing the concentration of non-bridging oxygen in the glass structure, depolymerizing the silicate network [74]. Limited literature is currently available on the effect of TiO2 inclusion in borate-based glass structures. Calcium oxide (CaO) and phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) are also incorporated into the glasses as Ca and P are the main elements in the inorganic phase of bone, facilitating bone formation and resorption [75]. Sodium oxide (Na2O) is included in the formulation as it has been proven to reduce the glass transition and crystallization temperature [76], facilitating lower enameling temperatures, thus reducing the risk of  to  transformation of the titanium substrate, a transformation which can hinder corrosion resistance [69].

1.4. Research Objectives
The objectives of this research are to: · Design, synthesize and subsequently characterize novel titanium-containing bioactive glasses, based on both silica and borate backbones, for the coating of metallic implants for medical applications: o X-ray diffraction will be performed on all glasses to determine where an amorphous composition is achieved and if crystal phase formation occurs during the glass firing, annealing and sintering process. o Differential scanning calorimetry will be performed to determine thermal characteristics of the novel glasses, including glass transition (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tx). o Energy dispersive spectroscopy will be employed to examine the glasses composition. o Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Magic-angle spinning - Nuclear magnetic resonance will provide information about the chemical bonds in each glass. · Investigate and assess the bioactivity and biocompatibility behavior of the fired glasses in vitro: o Solubility and ion release profile studies will be conducted to examine the timedependent behavior of the bioactive glasses immersed in deionized water. Solubility studies will determine how mass changes as a function of incubation

12

time, while ion release profiles will determine which ions are released and in which amounts from the glass into the incubation medium. o pH changes of the deionized water when exposed to the glass compositions will be studied to understand how glass degradation will affect the environment once it is placed inside the body. o To support the antibacterial claim, in vitro antibacterial analysis will be undertaken to test the ability of the proposed glasses to inhibit the growth of bacteria at the implantation site. o Cytotoxicity studies will be conducted to determine in vitro bioactivity of the glasses by culturing appropriate cells on the bioactive glass then evaluating its proliferation. · Measure and quantify mechanical characteristics of the bioactive glasses as coating materials: o Coating the titanium alloys through enameling with ethanol will be achieved with both silicate- and borate-based glasses on a titanium alloy Ti6Al4V substrate. o In order to achieve proper coating of the metals (i.e., no visible cracks or delamination on the coating), the coating must have a coefficient of thermal expansion comparable to that of the substrate. If this is not true, then the coating may fracture as it cools due to the mismatched thermal expansion coefficient. Determining CTE will facilitate the design of coatings with suitable thermal expansion.

13

o Upon coating, due to the mismatch in CTE, residual stresses and strains will be produced within the glass; these stresses and strains will be computed to assess the effect of the coating process on the glass. o The hardness of each glass will be measured using a Vickers indenter. This measurement will provide insight on the glass ability to withstand plastic deformation. o Strain energy release rate in mode I (opening) will measure the ability for cracks to propagate through the bioactive coating or along the coating/substrate interface. Higher quality glass will require a greater amount of energy to propagate cracks, reducing the chances for failure of the implant in the body. Strain energy release rate will be measure both for the bulk glass and for the glass coating/Ti alloy substrate system.

2.1. Introduction
In this chapter, the procedures for manufacturing the glasses are presented, as well as the procedure for coating them onto metals and the discs used in evaluating the biocompatibility, bioactivity and mechanical properties of the glasses. The nomenclature for the glasses used throughout this dissertation is also introduced in this chapter.

2.2. Glass preparation
The glass compositions and nomenclatures are reported in Table 2.1. TiO2 was added at the expense of SiO2 for the SRT series and at the expense of B2O3 for the BRT series. One batch of each glass was prepared by weighing out appropriate amounts of analytical grade reagents (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada & Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada), firing (14001500 °C for 1h for the silica-based glasses, 1200 °C for 1h for borate-based glasses) in silica crucibles, and shock quenching in water. The resulting frit was then ball-milled and sieved to retrieve glass particulates  20 µm. Table 2.1. Glass formulations (mol%).

2.3. Disc preparation
Approximately 200 mg of each glass were pressed using a hydraulic press with pressure ranging between 2,500 - 3,000 psi. The pressed discs were then heat treated to promote the coalescence of glass particles and create a solid body.

2.4. Coating preparation
Ti6Al4V substrate samples were degreased and cleaned in ethanol prior to coating. For each glass formulation, a suspension of the glass powder in ethanol (ratio of 5:1, ethanol to glass mass) was deposited on the substrates. Afterwards, the coatings were allowed to air-dry for 30 min, then fired at temperatures (Tcoat) ranging between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the crystallization temperature (Tx) of each glass (Table 2.2), for 15 minutes.

3. Characterization of Silica-based and Borate-based, Titaniumcontaining Bioactive Glasses for Coating Metallic Implants

19

The work presented in this chapter [77] is based on the peer-reviewed, published paper: Rodriguez, O., Curran, D.J., Papini, M., Placek, L.M., Wren, A.W., Schemitsch, E.H., Zalzal, P. and Towler, M.R., 2016. Characterization of silica-based and borate-based, titaniumcontaining bioactive glasses for coating metallic implants. Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, 433, pp.95-102.

3.1. Introduction
This chapter outlines the characterization of two novel bioactive glass series, a silicabased glass series and a borate-based glass series that contain increasing amounts of titanium oxide (TiO2). Titanium is employed to exploit its osseointegrative capability at the interface of the metallic implant and the bone. TiO2 was added in increments of 5 mol% up to 20 mol%. Characterization techniques included energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, particle size analysis (PSA) and magic-angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR).

3.2. Materials and Methods 3.2.1. Glass preparation
Glass preparation for this work was done as per Section 2.2. All glass compositions were evaluated.

3.2.2. Network connectivity (NC)
Network connectivity (NC) provides information on the ability for a glass to degrade and interact with the surrounding tissues [78]. Network connectivity for the proposed formulations were calculated using Eq. 3.1:

 =

!" !!"# !"#

(3.1)

where BO is the number of bridging oxygens, NBO the number of non-bridging oxygens and NBS the total number of bridging species. As network formers, 2 BO are contributed to the glass network per SiO2 and B2O3 in each Q2 unit; as network modifiers, 2 NBO are contributed per Ca2+ and 1 NBO per Na+. As for P2O5, recent work by Hill [79, 80, 81] provided insight on the role of phosphates in the glass network, demonstrating its role as an orthophosphate Q0 (glass modifier) in a SiO2-P2O5-CaO-Na2O series. Supported by this work, P2O5 may only be considered as a glass modifier, with 3 NBO per PO43-, and supporting data will be gathered through 31P MAS-NMR. As for ZnO and TiO2, these reagents behave as network intermediates; therefore, in considering ZnO as a glass former 1 BO is added, and 2 BO are added for TiO2. Considering these reagents as modifiers, 2 NBO are contributed per Zn2+ and per TiO62-.

3.2.3. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to confirm that an amorphous state was achieved for all fired materials. Samples were analyzed over the range of 20°  2  80°, with a step size of 0.05° using a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, QC, Canada). CuK (1.54 Å) anode was employed, with a generator voltage of 30 kV and a tube current of 10 mA. Crystalline 21

phases were identified using the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) standard diffraction patterns.

3.2.4. Particle size analysis (PSA)
After grinding and sieving of the glass, particle size analysis (PSA) was undertaken to retrieve the average particle size of the glass powder. Particle size analysis was achieved using a BeckmanCoulter Multisizer 4 Particle size analyzer (BeckmanCoulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Three powder samples per glass were evaluated in the range of 2 µm - 60 µm. Results were analyzed by Multisizer 4 software, with means and standard deviations based on counting statistics of 30,000 particles per measurement.

3.2.5. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
A combined differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analyzer (DSC-TGA) (SDT 2960 Simultaneous DSC-TGA, TA Instruments, DE, USA) was used to measure the glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tx) for both glass series. A heating rate of 20 °C min-1 was employed using an air atmosphere with alumina in a matched platinum crucible as a reference. Sample measurements were carried out every 6 sec between 20°C and 850°C.

3.2.6. Energy dispersive analysis (EDS)
Samples were analyzed using a JEOL JSM-6380LV Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA). Compositional analysis was performed with beam energy of 20.0 keV. EDS results were acquired using Oxford 22

EDS Aztec software, with standard deviations provided by the software based on counting statistics.

3.2.7. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
Silica-based and borate-based ground glass ( 20 µm) was used for this technique in ambient air (23 ± 1°C). The spectra were collected using a PerkinElmer Spectrum One IR (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Analysis was performed in the wavenumber ranging from 600 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1.

3.2.8. Magic-angle spinning- Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS-NMR)
For the silica-based series, 29Si and 31P MAS-NMR spectra was acquired with high power cw 1H decoupling on a Bruker AVANCE III 200 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a 7-mm CPMAS probe. The MAS rate was 4.5 kHz for 29Si and 5 kHz for 31P. The pulse time and recycle delay were 4 µsec and 60 sec, respectively, for the
29

Si MAS-NMR, and 3.25 µsec and 60 sec, respectively, for the 31P MAS-NMR. For the borate-

based series, 11B and 31P MAS-NMR experiments was carried out on an Agilent DD2 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) at the magnetic field of 11.7 Tesla. A zirconia rotor with a diameter of 3.2 mm was used for
11

measurements. Direct polarization 11B and 31P MAS-NMR spectra was taken at 160.3 MHz and 202.3 MHz, respectively, with 0.725 µsec pulse length (/8-pulse angle) and 5 sec recycle delay for 11B MAS-NMR, and with 2.8 µsec pulse length (/2-pulse angle) and 120 sec recycle delay for 31P MAS-NMR. 23

Si chemical shifts were referenced externally to the ­Si(CH3) resonance of tetrakis

trimethylsilyl silane [(CH3)3Si]4Si, which was assigned a chemical shift of -9.9 ppm with respect to tetramethyl silane C4H12Si at 0 ppm.
31

P chemical shifts were referenced externally to

ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NH4H2PO4, which was assigned a chemical shift of 0.81 ppm for the silica-based glasses (1.0 ppm for the borate-based glasses) with respect to 85% phosphoric acid H3PO4 at 0 ppm.
11

B chemical shifts were referenced externally to boric acid

H3BO3 saturated aqueous solution, which was assigned a chemical shift of -19.49 ppm with respect to boron trifluoride etherate (C2H5)2O·BF3 at 0 ppm.

3.3. Results 3.4.1. Network connectivity (NC)
Table 3.1 lists the network connectivity calculations for the fired glass formulations. For both glass series, the addition of TiO2 contributing to BO did not alter significantly the network connectivity regardless of ZnO contribution of BO or NBO. In considering the contribution of TiO2 of NBO in the form of TiO62-, network connectivity decreased as TiO2 is increased, with lower connectivity achieved as ZnO contributed to NBO as network modifier Zn2+.

3.4.2. X-Ray diffraction (XRD)
Crystallinity of the fired glasses was evaluated using XRD. The results are shown in Fig. 3.1 for the silica-based series and in Fig. 3.2 for the borate-based series. Results for SRT3 indicate no formation of crystal phases during the firing process; however, SRT0, SRT1, SRT2 and SRT4 exhibit sharp peaks, confirming the presence of some crystallinity in these glasses. XRD traces were compared to the ICDD and the phase identified as Sodium Calcium Phosphate Silicate Na2Ca4(PO4)SiO4 (Ref. 00-033-1229) in all cases. In the case of the borate-based series, glasses with up to 5 mol% TiO2 exhibited no crystal formation; however, at 10 mol% TiO2 peaks are observed, becoming more pronounced at 15 and 20 mol% TiO2; partial crystal phase of Titanium Oxide, TiO2 (Ref. 01-071-0650) was found in BRT2, BRT3 and BRT4.

3.4.3. Particle size analysis (PSA)
Upon grinding and sieving each glass the average particle size was assessed using PSA. As observed for the silica-based glass in Table 3.2, the mean particle size ranges between 3 µm-6 µm. The borate glasses have a mean particle size of around 9µm. Table 3.2. Particle size distribution for silica-based and borate-based glass series.

3.4.4. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
To determine the glass transition (Tg) and crystallization (Tx) temperatures for each glass, DSC was employed and results are shown on Table 3.3. A decrease in Tg for the silica-based glass series occurred with an increase in TiO2 at the expense of SiO2 up to 5 mol%. However, further increase in the amount of TiO2 up to 20 mol% resulted in an increase in Tg. In terms of Tx, increasing TiO2 from 0 mol% up to 10 mol% translated into a decrease in Tx, with subsequent increase as TiO2 increased to 20 mol%. For the borate-based glass series, Tg ranged between 520 °C and 530 °C, with no significant changes with the addition of TiO2. BRT0 (0 mol% TiO2) exhibited a Tg of 521 °C, reaching a maximum at 5 mol% TiO2 at 530 °C and a minimum at 10 mol% TiO2 at 520 °C. Tx was significantly impacted by the addition of TiO2. The lowest Tx was achieved for control BRT0 at 603 °C, increasing with addition of TiO2 up to 10 mol% at 670 °C, then decreasing with addition of TiO2, reaching 625 °C at 20 mol% TiO2. Table 3.3.

3.4.5. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
Table 3.4 and Table 3.5 summarize the element compositions for the silicate- and the borate-based glass series, respectively; EDS traces are shown in Fig. 3.3 for the silica-based series, and in Fig. 3.4 for the borate-based series. For both series, incorporation of titanium into the materials' structure is confirmed, and a reduction in silica (for the silicate-based series), and

27

of boron oxide (for the borate-based series) is observed. Silica was also found in the borate-based glasses, which resulted from using silica crucibles for firing these glasses; however, mole percentage is less than 5.0% (less than 1.5% weight percentage), so its effect may be negligible.

3.4.6. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
Absorbance spectra for the silica-based and borate-based glass series are shown in Fig. 3.5 and Fig. 3.6, respectively. From the absorbance spectra for the silica-based series, three peaks were observed, ~772 cm-1, ~928 cm-1 and ~991 cm-1. The 772 cm-1 band, belonging to Si­O­Si bending bond [82], remained visible up until the addition of 15 mol% TiO2 (SRT3), fading for 20 mol% TiO2 glass (SRT4), with the 991 cm-1 band, belonging to Si­O­Si stretched bond [82], present. This band was also identified for SRT0 and SRT1, and at a lower wavenumber (963 cm1

) for SRT3. Bond Si­O­NBO, centered around 928 cm-1 [82], showed no significant shift with

the addition of TiO2. A summary of the infrared (IR) assignments is listed in Table 3.6. For the borate-based series, bands were encountered near 696 cm-1, 770 cm-1, 916 cm-1, 1010 cm-1, 1248 cm-1 and 1345 cm-1 (refer to Table 3.6 for the IR assignment). Peaks at 696 cm-1 and 770 cm-1 indicate the presence of B­O­B bending bond [83], with absorbance intensity decreasing consistently decreasing with the additional of TiO2. The peak at 916 cm-1, belonging to stretching bond B­O in diborate groups [83], maintained absorbance levels with the increase in the content of TiO2, with slight shifts for BRT1 and BRT2, and significant shifts for BRT3 (to 859 cm-1) and BRT4 (to 900 cm-1), compositions which exhibited the crystallization of TiO2.

exhibited three peaks, ~13.61 ppm, ~8.93 ppm and ~0.43 ppm, corresponding to Q3 structures in the form of symmetric BO3, asymmetric BO3, and Q4 structures in the form of BO4 species, respectively [85], with chemical shifts increasing with the addition of TiO2 up to 10 mol%, with BRT2 peaking at ~14.05 ppm, ~9.51 ppm and ~0.87 ppm, respectively; however, further addition of TiO2 and the presence of crystal phase TiO2 resulted in a decrease in chemical shift to ~13.76 ppm, ~9.07 ppm and ~0.58 ppm, respectively, at 15 mol%. At 20 mol%, and with greater crystallinity intensities, the chemical shift shifted to ~14.05 ppm, ~9.51 ppm and ~0.73 ppm. For the borate-based glass series, the 31P NMR spectra exhibits a single peak, ~4.82 ppm (Q0) [84], for all compositions, with the chemical at the peak decreasing with the addition of TiO2 from 0 to 10 mol%, then increasing at 15 and 20 mol%.

3.5. Discussion
With respect to the silica-based series, amorphicity remained for glass SRT3, which contains 15 mol% of TiO2, evidenced by the amorphous hump and lack of sharp peaks found in the XRD traces; whereas partial crystallinity (i.e., the amorphous hump remained visible in the background of the XRD traces, as exhibited by SRT3) was found for glasses SRT0, SRT1, SRT2 and SRT4, containing 0, 5, 10 and 20 mol% TiO2, respectively. XRD traces were compared to the ICDD database, and identified as Sodium Calcium Phosphate Silicate Na2Ca4(PO4)SiO4 (Ref. 00-033-1229) in all cases.
31

P NMR for the partially crystallized glasses exhibited two peaks

(~4.26 ppm and ~2.60 ppm), with the exception of SRT2, which may be attributed to low intensity crystal peaks compared to SRT0, SRT1 and SRT4; amorphous glass SRT3 presented 35

only one peak (~4.71 ppm). The presence of the Sodium Calcium Phosphate Silicate phase may explain the occurrence on the second peak (~2.60 ppm) for the crystalline materials, accounting for Q1 tetrahedron (pyrophosphate) in Na2Ca4(PO4)SiO4, whereas the peak ~4.26 ppm and ~4.71 ppm indicates the presence of orthophosphate (Q0 tetrahedron) [84], supporting the statement that P2O5 would enter the glass network as a network modifier, rather than as a network former [80]. 29Si NMR peak was located at -93.67 ppm for SRT0 (Q4), increasing as TiO2 is added up to 15 mol% to -90.44 ppm, then decreasing to -96.90 ppm for SRT4 at 20 mol%. Considering the crystal peak intensities, the decreased chemical shift in 29Si is observed with increased intensity, suggesting that phase Na2Ca4(PO4)SiO4 promoted the formation of Q4 structures in the glasses. As for the borate-based series, no crystallization occurred in glasses with up to 10 mol% TiO2, i.e., BRT0 and BRT1. Partial crystal phase of Titanium Oxide TiO2 (Ref. 01-071-0650) was found in BRT2, BRT3 and BRT4, indicating a possible saturation point for the addition of TiO2 to the control glass BRT0. Studies have been performed to determine the effect of crystallinity on glass solubility and ion release [86], which points toward fully amorphous glasses providing better solubility and ion release profiles compared to crystalline materials. As coating materials, degradation behavior of these glasses is important to bacterial inhibition and osseointegration; therefore, further studies on the degradation of these partially crystallized materials would confirm how effective these materials are in releasing ions into the body and would help quantify the effect of partial crystallinity on the properties of these particular glasses. Compared to the SRT results,
31

P for the BRT series presented only one peak for all glasses,

centered at 4.82 ppm for BRT0, corresponding to orthophosphate PO4-3 (Q0 tetrahedron) [84], decreasing with the addition of TiO2 up to 10 mol%, with BRT2 exhibiting a peak at 2.71 ppm; however, the presence of crystallinity translated into an increase to 2.74 ppm for BRT3, and

36

further to 3.12 ppm for BRT4, correlating the increase in chemical shift with the increase in crystallinity intensity. 11B NMR exhibited three peaks, ~13.61 ppm, ~8.93 ppm and ~0.43 ppm, corresponding to Q3 structures in the form of symmetric BO3, asymmetric BO3, and Q4 structures in the form of BO4 species, respectively [85]; furthermore, it was observed from FTIR the presence of different boron-to-oxygen bonds, as shown in Table 3.6. It may be argued that the presence of TiO2 crystals perturbed stretching bond B­O in diborate groups, but favoring these bonds for tri-, tetra- and pentaborate groups, as the peak at 1010 cm-1 is only observed for the control BRT0, then also in BRT3 and BRT4, with minor shifts to 990 cm-1 and 1000 cm-1, respectively. The maxima around 1248 cm-1 and 1345 cm-1, belonging to asymmetric stretching of B­O bonds, remained unchanged up until 15 mol% TiO2, but experienced a shift to 1232 cm-1 and 1306 cm-1 for BRT4, respectively, which may be attributed to the presence of crystal phase TiO2 at higher concentration compared to BRT3. Provided the absence of IR peaks pertaining to bonds of titanium, it suggests TiO2 behavior as a network modifier, rather than a network former, for both silica-based and borate-based glasses. It was found that as TiO62- enters the glass network for the proposed materials, a decrease of NC below 2 is expected, which by definition favors bioactivity, with Zn+2 contributing as well to the decrease in NC. NBO disrupt the glass network by depolymerizing Si-O-Si and B-O-B [74, 87], which facilities ion release from the glass network, increasing bioactivity [88], suggesting that TiO2 entered the glass network as modifier TiO62-, rather than as a former, allows for better bioactivity. In evaluating the suitability of the bioactive glasses for coating, the processing window (T) is defined by the range between Tx and Tg; a larger processing window is more desirable as it allows for a wider range of temperatures in which to process the glass [46]. The smallest

37

processing window for the SRT series, 54°C, occurred for SRT2, whereas the maximum processing window, 116°C, occurred for SRT0. Greater processing windows were found for the BRT series, with the smallest one (BRT0) at 82°C and the largest one (BRT2) at 150°C. Crystallization temperatures for both glass series are, however, below the  transus temperature for commercially pure (cp) Ti (882 ± 2°C) and Ti6Al4V (995°C to 1010°C) [69], two preferred metals for implant applications; therefore, in coating titanium with these glasses, no  to  transformation will occur, preserving the oxidation resistance in alpha phases compared to beta phases. With the increase in TiO2 in the silica-based series, a decrease was observed in the processing window T up to 10 mol%, with an increase with further increase in TiO2. Increasing TiO2 beyond 10 mol% directly translated into an increase in Tg and Tx, with the absence of crystal peaks in SRT3 resulting in a greater T, attributed to higher energy required to promote the formation of new crystal structures within the glassy material, thus increasing Tg. For the borate-based series, at 10 mol% maximum Tx was achieved, where low crystal peak intensities are first encountered for this series; the addition of TiO2 beyond this point increased peak intensities, which translated into decreased Tx (and subsequently decreased T). It may be suggested that the presence of crystal phase TiO2 favored crystallization, hence reducing Tx as TiO2 was increased beyond 10 mol% in the borate-based series.

3.6. Chapter Summary
Incorporation of TiO2 to silica-based and borate-based glasses was achieved through standard melt-quenching glass synthesis processes. MAS-NMR proved that P2O5 acted as a network modifier for both glass series by evidencing only Q0 structures (and Q1 structures for the silica-based glasses with crystal structures), whereas FTIR proved that TiO2 acted as a network

38

modifier by lack of peaks assignable to titanium bonding. Upon characterization, the two glass series are expected to have potential as coatings on metals owing to the favorable network connectivity calculations, inferring that the glasses will degrade in-situ and release ions at the site of implantation. Additionally, thermal behavior of these glasses provided for processing windows which make them suitable for enameling metallic implants, with the borate-based series exhibiting greater processing windows over the silica-based series. Further studies will provide additional insight on the advantages and disadvantages of employing borate-based glasses for coating applications in contrast to silica-based glasses, expanding the range of applications of bioactive materials. The biocompatibility and bioactivity of the glasses will be studied in the next chapter. Though both glass series exhibited thermal, structural and compositional characteristics making them suitable materials for coating applications, it was observed that zinc oxide may not have been properly incorporated into SRT4, as this formulation required higher firing temperatures and may not have fully melted. Since zinc oxide is the antibacterial component in these glass series, and that characteristic is fundamental to achieve the objectives of this dissertation, glass SRT4 (and subsequently, BRT4) was removed from further evaluation.

The work contained in this chapter [89] has been submitted for publication as follows: Rodriguez, O., Stone, W., Papini, M., Schemitsch, E.H., Zalzal, P., Waldman, S. and Towler, M.R., 2016. Biocompatibility Behavior of Titanium-containing Bioactive Glasses for Metallic Implant Coating: Solubility, Cytotoxicity and Antibacterial Analysis, Journal of NonCrystalline Solids (under review).

4.1. Introduction
The results of Chapter 3 demonstrated the successful incorporation of titanium dioxide into the glass structure of silica-based and borate-based glasses, and that these compositions exhibited characteristics that make them suitable for coating applications while preventing bacterial proliferation. For example, the glasses exhibited large enameling processing windows, glass transition and crystallization temperatures below beta transus temperature for titanium and its alloys, and the incorporation of antibacterial reagent zinc oxide in these glasses was confirmed. However, glass SRT4 did not successfully incorporate zinc oxide. Therefore, the work in this chapter does not consider glass SRT4 and, consequently, BRT4. This chapter evaluates the characteristics of the two glass series, a silica-based and a borate-based, in terms of their degradative behavior (including solubility and ion release profiles), cytotoxicity, and in vitro antibacterial capabilities. For the latter studies, inhibition zones will be measured in media containing Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli.

41

4.2. Methods 4.2.1. Sample preparation
Glass preparation for this work was done as per Section 2.2, and discs were prepared as per Section 2.3. For this work, glass compositions were evaluated from both series up to 15 mol% incorporated TiO2.

4.2.2. Solubility analysis
Three glass discs (n = 3) for each glass composition were placed in separate containers filled with 25 mL of deionized water, and incubated at 37°C for 1, 7 and 30 days. The discs were weighted prior to incubation, and re-weighed after each incubation period; the percentage difference from the initial mass of the disc was then computed as a function of time, as follows:

%!(!) =

! ! ! ! (!) !!

100%

(4.1)

where %ml(t) is the percentage of mass loss, m0 is the mass at time zero (before incubation) and m(t) is the mass at time t (where t = 1, 7 and 30 days).

4.2.3. Ion release through Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
Samples for ion release profiles were prepared as described in Section 4.2.2 and measured using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), model PinAAcle 500 Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). AAS calibration standards for titanium and zinc ions at concentrations of 0.00 (blank sample), 0.50, 1.00, 5.00 and 10.00 ppm were prepared from stock solutions on a gravimetric basis. At 1, 7 and 30 days, samples were 42

tested, with the AAS measuring absorbance levels, which were automatically translated into concentration levels by the Syngistix Touch software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) based on the ion calibration curves.

4.2.4. pH change
Samples (n = 3) for pH change were prepared as described in Section 4.2.2. At 1, 7 and 30 days, samples were tested using an Omega PHH222 pH meter (Omega, Laval, QC, Canada) and compared to reference samples at t = 0 days to determine how pH varied in the presence of the glass discs.

4.2.5. In vitro antibacterial analysis
The antimicrobial properties of the SRT and BRT glass discs were evaluated on agar plates against prokaryotic species Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) against bacterial lawns, spread on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) (3 g/L Tryptic Soy Broth, 15 g/L agar). All chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON, Canada). Bacterial cultures were grown to an exponential phase (12 ­ 16 hr), diluted in Physiological Saline Solution (9 g/L NaCl) to 106 cells/mL and spread onto TSA. Antimicrobial properties were quantified on the bacteria by measuring and comparing the zones of growth inhibition. One disc (prepared as described in Section 4.2.2) of each glass was added to each bacterial plate (4 discs per plate, evenly spaced on the lawn). Each plate had a single microbial species, and each species was repeated in triplicate for statistical comparisons. The diameters of the bacterial inhibition zones were measured at 1, 7 and 30 days, and the means and standard deviations of triplicate samples were compared with the post-hoc Tukey analysis of variance. 43

4.2.6. Cytotoxicity study
Bone metabolic activity assays were conducted to determine in vitro bioactivity of the glasses. Pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (ATCC CRL-2593, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) from passage 3-5 were used for this study and were maintained in MEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% (2 mM) L-glutamine (Cambrex, MD, USA) within a cell culture incubator at 37°C/5% CO2/95% air atmosphere. Cells were seeded into 24 well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 and incubated for 24 hr prior to testing. Culture media (1 ml) was then further supplemented with 100 µl of liquid extract (from the solubility samples at 30 days for all glasses; n = 3 per sample well) and then incubated for 24 hr at 37°C/5% CO2. The MTT was added in an amount equal to 10% of the culture medium volume/well. The cultures were then re-incubated for a further 2 hr (37°C/5% CO2) after which they were removed from the incubator and the resultant formazan crystals dissolved by adding an amount of MTT Solubilization Solution (10% Triton x-100 in Acidic Isopropanol (0.1 n HCI)) equal to the original culture medium volume. Once the crystals were fully dissolved, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm. Cells seeded (at the same density) on tissue culture plastic (n = 3) were used as controls.

4.2.7. Statistical methods
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to analyze the data to determine significance in mean difference across the gathered data when p < 0.05. Post-hoc Tukey and Dunnett tests were used on MiniTab 17 (MiniTab Inc., State College, PA, USA). The Tukey test assumes equal variance in the data sets being analyzed to determine the significance in mean difference across all factors (i.e., all glasses in both series); the Dunnett test also assumes equal variance in the data, and it is employed when a control group is used to compare against the data 44

sets. Results from the solubility analysis, pH change studies, AAS measurements and in vitro antibacterial studies were analyzed using post-hoc Tukey; cytotoxicity results were analyzed using post-hoc Dunnett.

4.3. Results 4.3.1. Solubility analysis
Evaluation of the mass loss at different incubation periods was undertaken, with results shown in Fig. 4.1 for the SRT glass series, and Fig. 4.2 for the BRT glass series. As a function of incubation period, it is observed that mass loss steadily increased from day 1 to day 30, with SRT1 and BRT0 experiencing the greatest amount of degradation within their respective series. Borate-based glasses exhibited much higher degradation behavior as opposed to the silica-based counterparts, which was expected as borate-based glasses are known to degrade faster than silica-based glasses due to their lower chemical durability [90]; additionally, crystallinity in the silica-based glasses may only account for the reduced solubility of these glasses. As a function of incubation period, for the SRT series, only SRT0 and SRT3 exhibited a significant increase in solubility between 1 and 30 days (vs. all other SRT glasses), and SRT0 and SRT3 between 1 and 7 days and between 7 and 30 days did not exhibit a significant difference in solubility; for the BRT series, all weight changes for all glasses were statistically different, except for BRT0 and BRT2 between 1 and 7 days. As a function of the amount of TiO2, a reduction in solubility is observed as the amount of TiO2 is increased to 15 mol% for the silica-based glasses. Similarly, for the borate-based glasses, a decrease in solubility is observed, but only up to 10 mol% TiO2, with a significant increase for BRT3 (15 mol% incorporated TiO2).

4.3.2. Ion release through Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
Zn2+ release for the SRT series is shown in Fig. 4.3, while results for the BRT glass series are shown in Fig. 4.4; Ti4+ release is shown in Fig. 4.5 and Fig. 4.6 for the SRT and BRT glass series, respectively. For both glass series, the inclusion of TiO2 up to 10 mol% resulted in a significant drop in the concentration of Zn2+ released; however, at 15 mol% an increase in Zn2+ release was observed. In terms of incubation time, a significant increase in Zn2+ is observed for both glass series at all incubation times, except for SRT2 between 1 and 7 days. With respect to Ti4+ release, for the SRT series an increase in release is observed, which may be associated with a decrease in crystallinity for this series as TiO2 is increased (SRT3 is amorphous, while SRT1 and SRT2 exhibit crystallinity) [77]; Ti4+ release in the BRT glasses increased with TiO2 content incorporated into the glass, with a decrease observed for BRT3, glass which exhibited a secondary phase of TiO2 in XRD [77] explaining the decrease in Ti4+ release. As a function of incubation time, all glasses exhibited statistically different Ti4+ concentrations at each time.

4.3.3. pH Change
Changes in the pH of deionized water were evaluated for the SRT and BRT glasses, with results shown in Fig. 4.7 and Fig. 4.8, respectively. After 30-days incubation, no significant difference is observed as a function of the amount of TiO2 incorporated for the SRT series, with the SRT glasses averaging a pH of 7.90; due to the small standard deviations in the measurements for the BRT series, only the pH at 30 days for BRT0 and BRT3 are not significantly different. pH changes due to exposure to BRT glasses ranged between 8.67 and 8.85.

4.3.4. In vitro antibacterial analysis
Inhibition zones were measured for cultures of S. epidermidis and E. coli after 1, 7 and 30 days of incubation with SRT and BRT glass discs. Results are shown in Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10 for S. epidermidis inhibition by the SRT and BRT glasses, respectively, and in Fig. 4.11 for E. coli inhibition by the BRT glasses. No inhibition zones were observed in the E. coli cultures, with the exception of BRT0, which showed a small zone after 1 day, but with the presence of bacteria in-growth in the zone, indicating resistance of the E. coli bacteria to the antibacterial effect of BRT0. Regarding S. epidermidis, the SRT glasses exhibited inhibition zones that remained constant as a function of incubation time (with the exception of SRT1, which started exhibiting antibacterial activity after 7 days, and SRT0 significantly increased from day 1 to day 7). Greater inhibition zones were observed for the BRT glasses, namely BRT0 and BRT3, with BRT0 proving to be the best antibiotic glass from both glass series. BRT1 and BRT2 exhibited no inhibition zone. Statistically, for S. epidermidis, all SRT glasses are significantly equivalent, whereas for the BRT glasses only BRT1 and BRT2 (both glasses which exhibited no antibacterial behavior) are significantly equivalent.

4.3.5. Cytotoxicity studies
Cell viability was assessed through an MTT assay for cytotoxicity, with results reported in Fig. 4.12. Overall, a decrease in absorbance was observed for all glasses when compared with the control, indicating a decrease in proliferation in the presence of the glasses; nonetheless, glasses SRT1, SRT3 and BRT2 were found to be statistically equivalent to the controls. Contrasting the SRT and BRT series, the performance of both series could be described as similar, with SRT3 (10 mol% incorporated TiO2) exhibiting higher proliferation opposed to the other glasses; however, all glasses were statistically equal in terms of cell viability among themselves.

4.4. Discussion
From Fig. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2, it can be observed that the inclusion of TiO2 in both the silicabased and the borate-based glass structures resulted in a decrease in solubility. For the silicabased glasses, at 30 days, decreasing solubility with increasing TiO2 content to up to 15 mol% can be observed, whereas for the borate-based glasses this trend is observed only up to 10 mol% TiO2. BRT3 exhibited degradation behavior comparable to that of the control BRT0, which may be attributed to TiO2 in BRT3 partially existing as a separate phase from the glass phase [77], which may explain the increased solubility of these particular glass samples. In terms of overall solubility, the borate-based glasses exhibited higher solubility compared to the silica-based glasses, which was expected since borate-based glasses have been shown to degrade faster than their silica-based counterparts due to their lower chemical durability [91, 92], making them 54

suitable for applications where faster dissolution of the coating is required. Degradation is also confirmed through AAS, which recorded larger quantities of Zn2+ and Ti4+ released from the control glasses (SRT0 and BRT0) as opposed to their titanium-containing counterparts. Boratebased structures allow for the release of the modifier ions more readily than silicate-based structures. Moreover, for BRT3, an increase in degradation is observed when compared to BRT2, the amount of Ti4+ released did not follow this trend, which, again, is to be attributed to the occurrence of TiO2 as a separate phase in the glass, a phase which, due to its crystallinity, does not allow for titanium to be released. As expected, exposure of the glass samples to deionized water resulted in an increase in pH of the environment due to the release of ions altering the acidity of the media. With the greater dissolution of the BRT series, pH was observed to increase more than in the SRT series; however, at 30 days, it can be seen that the pH of the media for all BRT glasses reached a maximum of 8.85. For the SRT series, which exhibited much lower solubility, the pH reached a maximum of 8.05 for SRT2 after 30 days incubating. A higher pH raise in borate-based glasses compared to silica-based glasses has been previously reported [61]; furthermore, the substitution of SiO2 with TiO2 did not significantly affect the pH levels, and substitution of B2O3 with TiO2 did not result in a substantial change in pH levels after 30 days. As an antibacterial agent, the amounts of Zn2+ released, as measured by AAS at day 1, are linked to the larger bacterial inhibition zones in BRT0 and BRT3 in the BRT series and SRT0 in the SRT series for Gram-positive bacteria S. epidermidis, with the BRT series significantly outranking the SRT series. Additionally, the SRT glasses that exhibited antibacterial behavior also showed signs of bacterial recolonization, evidencing the weak antibacterial nature of these glasses. The proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli was not

55

significantly affected by the presence of any of the glasses. Gram-positive bacterial growth is more likely to be inhibited when compared to Gram-negative bacterial growth given that Gramnegative bacteria have a layer of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules, not present in Grampositive bacteria, acting as an impermeable layer to the antibacterial effects of Zn2+ [93, 94]. It has been shown that, for the same concentration of zinc ions from zinc nanoparticles, inhibition zones for Gram-negative bacteria are 16-33% smaller than those of Gram-positive bacteria [95]. In fact, glass BRT0, which showed greater inhibition zones in the presence of gram-positive bacteria S. epidermidis, was the only glass composition in this study that exhibited an inhibition zone for Gram-negative E. coli. In the light of these results, it would be expected that BRT0 would exhibit antibacterial behavior when tested in vivo, tackling the issue of bacterial infection at the site of prosthetic implantation [14, 15, 16]. Further time-dependent tests in liquid or biofilm systems are necessary to corroborate these antibacterial results in scenarios closer to in vivo environments. When tested to determine the cell viability capacity of the glasses, it was determined that all glasses slowed down the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, though per ISO10993-5:2009 this reduction is considered as nontoxic [96]. This reduced proliferation was unexpected, as the levels of Zn2+ were not found to be toxic [97], indicating potential toxicity of the borate ion (BO3)3- for the BRT glasses, which has been found to occur in vitro in boratebased glasses [98], while this toxicity has not been reported under dynamic testing conditions [99]. Furthermore, inhibition of cell proliferation for both glasses may be explained by a faster release of sodium (alkali ion) over calcium (alkaline ion) [76, 100, 101], linked to the glass compositions possessing a higher Na2O than CaO (14 mol% vs. 12 mol%). Once an implant is inserted in the human body, two processes start to occur: bacteria attempt to colonize it, while tissue integration from the surroundings occurs; this phenomenon is

56

known as "the race for the surface" [102, 103]. The desirable outcome is that bacterial infection is inhibited, while tissue integration is promoted; the antibacterial results herein presented present BRT0 and BRT3 as potential candidates to eliminate bacteria at the implantation site, with their superior antibacterial conditions potentially allowing for bone cells to attach and proliferate around the implant in vivo.

4.5. Chapter Summary
Silica-based and borate-based glass series have been evaluated to assess their antibacterial, solubility and cytotoxicity characteristics for their potential as coating materials for surgical implants. Overall, the borate-based glasses exhibited significantly superior antibacterial and solubility behavior, with BRT0 and BRT3 (at 0 and 15 mol% of TiO2 incorporated, respectively) outperforming the remainder of the glasses. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy demonstrated the release of Zn2+, which is linked to the antibacterial inhibition observed by these glasses. In vitro cytotoxicity studies were conducted using MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts to evaluate how cell proliferation was affected by the proposed glasses, with results indicating a decrease in proliferation, which may be attributed to the presence of (BO3)3- in the borate-based glasses, and a faster release of sodium ion over calcium ion in both glass series, factors which are known to slow cell proliferation in vitro. Nonetheless, in vivo studies will be required to evaluate the effect of a dynamic environment on the cytotoxicity and antibacterial inhibitory characteristics of these glasses. The evaluation of the mechanical properties of these glass series and their behavior used as coatings on metals will be discussed in the next chapter, focusing on the strain energy release rates, hardness and coefficients of thermal expansion. Through the biocompatibility and

57

bioactivity evaluation, borate-based glasses proved superior to the silica-based glasses, with BRT0 and BRT3 outperforming the other glasses in the series. BRT1 and BRT2 exhibited similar behaviors; however, BRT2 exhibited the lowest solubility after 30 days in the boratebased glass series and no antibacterial activity. For this reason, BRT2 (and subsequently SRT2) will not be in the scope of evaluation of the following chapter.

The work contained in this chapter [104] has been submitted for publication as follows: Rodriguez, O., Matinmanesh, A., Papini, M., Schemitsch, E.H., Zalzal, P., Clarkin, O. and Towler, M.R., 2016. Silica-based and Borate-based, Titania-containing Bioactive Coatings Characterization: strain energy release rate, residual stresses, hardness and thermal expansion, Journal of Functional Biomaterials, 7(4), pp.32.

5.1. Introduction
The results of Chapter 4 demonstrated the superior degradation and antibacterial behavior for the borate-based glasses, specifically for BRT0 and BRT3. Glasses BRT2 and SRT2 did not show any significant in vitro cytotoxicity or antibacterial behavior compared to the remaining glasses, with both glasses exhibiting the lowest degradation behavior within their respective series and no antibacterial properties. Since biocompatibility and bioactivity are required for the proposed coatings to battle the drawbacks from DSA, then the work in this chapter does not consider glasses BRT2 and SRT2, alongside SRT4 and BRT4, which were already removed from further evaluation. In this chapter, both glass series will be evaluated to determine their coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and its effect on the residual stresses and strains post-coating, their critical strain energy release rate in mode I (opening) of the coating/substrate system through double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimens and of the bulk glass through Vickers indentation, and their bulk hardness.

5.2. Methods 5.2.1. Samples preparation
Glass preparation for this work was done as per Section 2.2; discs were prepared as per Section 2.3; and sample coating were prepared as per Section 2.4, all procedures outlined in Chapter 2. For this work, glass compositions were evaluated from both series at 0, 5 and 15 mol% incorporated TiO2.

5.2.2. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) measurement by Linear Dilatometry
The CTE of each glass was tested based on current ASTM E228 "Standard Test Method for Linear Thermal Expansion of Solid Materials with a Push-Rod Dilatometer" [105]. Samples (n = 3) were prepared following the procedure outlined in Section 2.3, with samples measuring 6 mm in diameter and 12 mm in height (by stacking 4 discs), and tested with a Netzsch DIL 402 PC dilatometer (Netzsch Instruments, Burlington, MA, USA). A heating rate of 4°C/min was employed, with testing temperature range from 25 to 300°C for the both glass series. Based on the measured lengths and temperature changes, CTE was determined as

where m is the mean CTE of the glass, T is the change in temperature with respect to the initial temperature, L0 is the initial length of the test specimen, and L is the change in length of the sample with respect to the initial length L0.

5.2.3. Residual Stress and Strain Analysis
Due to the mismatch between CTE of the substrate and of the coating, residual stresses at the interface are induced. Based on the measured CTE as per Section 5.2.2, and based on the cooling profile and temperatures as per Section 2.4, residual strains were computed as

This approach has already been proposed and verified by Oel and Frechette [106]. To determine the residual stresses, Yu et al. [107] proposed the use of EulerBernoulli beam theory on bi-layer materials with different CTEs subjected to thermal loading. The residual stress at the interface experienced by the glass coating is

5.2.4. Vickers Hardness
Samples (n = 3) for hardness testing were prepared as described in Section 2.3. An HM114 Mitutoyo Testing Machine (Mitutoyo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was utilized, equipped with a Vickers indenter, and loading the samples with a force of 1 kgf (9.81 N) for 10 s. The indent diagonals were measured through the integrated optical microscope at 20x.

5.2.5. Coating Bulk Mode I Strain Energy Release Rate Using Vickers Indentation
The mode I strain energy release rate of the bulk glasses was measured by indenting glass discs (n = 3 per glass composition), prepared as per Section 2.3 and indented similarly to the process described in 5.2.4. A schematic depiction of the indent is shown in Fig. 5.1. According to Anstis et al. [54], the indentation load needs to be large enough to create an indent pattern that is well-defined and cracks that are longer than the indent diameter (2a), yet shorter than one tenth of the thickness of the sample (300 µm in this case) to avoid interactions with the lower free

63

surface of the specimen. The indentation load is considered too large if it breaks the sample or causes a chipping on the sample's surface [54].

By trial and error, the appropriate indentation load to meet the aforementioned force criteria was found to be 3 kgf (29.43 N). This indentation load was applied using a Macro indenter HM-114 Mitutoyo Testing Machine (Mitutoyo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) normal to the surface of the glass for the duration of 10 s. The length of the crack was measured through scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a JEOL JSM-6380LV SEM (JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA). The mode I critical strain energy release rate of the bulk glass was found using the equation below [109, 110]:

where P is the applied load, H is hardness of the glass (as measured per Section 5.2.4), c is the length of the surface trace of the half penny crack measured from the center of the indent, and  is the calibration constant  = 0.016 ± 0.004 [54]. Equation 5.5 is derived for plane stress. 64

Even though the current application does not completely satisfy the plane stress condition, Eq. 5.5 can still be used as an approximation of GIC given that the thickness of the discs is less than half of their diameter.

5.2.6. Coating/Substrate System Mode I Strain Energy Release Rate
The mode I critical strain energy release rate (GIC) of the coating on the substrate was evaluated following the procedure outlined by Matinmanesh et al. [70]. Typical sample dimensions for the bilayer double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimen are shown in Fig. 5.2. Three samples per glass composition were tested, with at least two measurements obtained per sample. Coated samples prepared as described in Section 2.4 were used to make the test specimens, then an epoxy layer (J-B Weld 8265-S Cold Weld Compound, Sulphur Springs, TX, USA) was deposited to cover the glass and attach the second titanium alloy substrate. Specimens were loaded using a STM United Tensile Tester (United Testing Systems, Inc., Huntington Beach, CA, USA) using a 500-N load cell at a rate of 0.5 mm/min; then based on the recorded loads, the mode I critical strain energy release rate GIC was calculated as

5.2.7. Statistical methods
The results of all the measurements were expressed as means with experimental scatter expressed as a standard deviation. Additionally, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to analyze the data to determine significance in mean difference across the gathered data when p < 0.05. Post-hoc Tukey test was used on MiniTab 17 (MiniTab Inc., State College, PA, USA). The Tukey test assumes equal variance in the data sets being analyzed to determine the significance in mean difference across all factors (i.e. all glasses in both series).

5.3. Results 5.3.1. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) measurement by Linear Dilatometry
Results from the measurement of the CTE are plotted in Fig. 5.3. The CTE of the silicabased glasses were found to be consistently greater than the CTE of Ti6Al4V, with the percentage difference ranging between 11.1% and 24.0%, whereas the CTE for the borate-based glasses were found to be below the CTE of Ti6Al4V with smaller percentage difference, ranging between 4.1 and 5.8%. In statistical terms, the CTE for all borate-based glasses were found to be equivalent; the CTE for SRT0 and SRT1 were also found to be equivalent. 66

5.3.2. Residual Stress and Strain Analysis
Residual strains results (Eq. 5.2) are shown in Fig. 5.4, where it can be seen that, in terms of the magnitude, greater strains were experienced when the silica-based coatings were employed, compared to the borate-based ones. This is due to higher CTE mismatch between the silica-based glasses and the titanium substrate, especially for the case of SRT3 (15 mol% incorporated TiO2). Residual stress magnitudes in the glass coating (Fig. 5.5) at the interfacial site (Eq. 5.3) follow a similar trend as the residual strains, with borate-based glasses exhibiting compressive residual stresses and silica-based glasses exhibiting tensile residual stresses.

5.3.3. Vickers Hardness
A substitution of SiO2 for B2O3 resulted in an increase in the Vickers hardness of the glass, as shown in Fig. 5.6, statistically significant at 5 and 15 mol% of incorporated TiO2. The incorporation of TiO2, however, did not significantly affect the hardness for the BRT glass series; for the SRT glass series, the addition of TiO2 to 5 mol% decreased the hardness, but further addition did not significantly decrease it.

5.3.4. Bulk Mode I Critical Strain Energy Release Rate Using Vickers Indentation
The Vickers indentation test was performed to measure the bulk mode I critical strain energy release rate (Eq. 5.5), and the results are shown in Fig. 5.7. A sample of the SEM image for SRT0 showing the indent and the cracks emanating from it is presented in Fig. 5.8. Figure 5.7 69

also presents as reference points the data obtained from the literature for the mode I critical strain energy release rate of fused silica based glass (99.995% SiO2) and Pyrex (heat resistant borosilicate glass). Based on previous studies, the fracture toughness KIC and modulus of elasticity Ec of fused silica glass and Pyrex are 0.80 MPa.m1/2 [111], 0.63 MPa.m1/2 [112] and 72 GPa [111], 67 GPa [113], respectively. The following equation [109], valid for plane stress condition, was used to convert these KIC and Ec values to the GIC in Fig. 5.7, yielding 8.9 J/m2 for fused silica and 5.9 J/m2 for Pyrex.

5.3.5. Coating/ Substrate System Mode I Critical Strain Energy Release Rate
The mode I critical strain energy release rates for the coating/substrate system for both glass series are shown in Fig. 5.9. Systems made with borate-based glasses exhibited higher critical strain energy release rates in mode I opposed to the silica-based coatings, with the exception of SRT1 and BRT1 (5 mol% incorporated TiO2), which were statistically equivalent (p < 0.05). As a function of percentage of TiO2 incorporated, for the silica-based series, there is no significant difference in the critical strain energy release rate between 0 and 5 mol% incorporated TiO2 and between 5 and 15 mol% incorporated TiO2; however, statistical difference is observed between 0 and 15 mol% incorporated TiO2. Similarly, for systems made with the borate-based series, there is no significant increase (p < 0.05) in critical strain energy release rate between 0 and 5 mol% incorporated TiO2, whereas a significant increase is found between 0 and 15 mol% incorporated TiO2, and between 5 and 15 mol% incorporated TiO2.

5.4. Discussion
The CTE results confirmed that the borate-based glasses possessed CTEs comparable to that of Ti6Al4V, evidenced by the reduced percentage difference of the CTEs between the borate-based glasses and Ti6Al4V, compared to the silica-based glasses. However, the CTE for the proposed silica-based glasses was significantly lower than what has been reported for other similar glasses (e.g. CTE of Bioglass® 45S5 has been reported to be 15.1x10-6/°C over the range from 200-400°C [52]), indicating that the proposed silicate formulations would provide better adhesion to the metallic substrate compared to other silica-based glasses since these novel silicate glasses would induce tensile residual stresses of lower magnitude when used as coatings compared to Bioglass® 45S5. Hence they would offer better resistance to crack growth. Since the addition of TiO2 increased CTE, then the control silicate formulation should be analyzed to

72

understand the causes behind the reduced CTE. Compared to 45S5, SRT0 contains a higher molar percentage of SiO2 and contains ZnO at 16 mol%, whereas 45S5 does not include ZnO. Higher SiO2 content is known to decrease CTE of silica-based glasses [45], which explains how substituting SiO2 for TiO2 in the SRT glasses translated into an increase in the CTE. Furthermore, ZnO increase (or inclusion, in this case) has been proven to decrease the CTE of silica-based glasses [114], explaining the reduced CTE of SRT0 compared to 45S5. Since the CTEs of the borate-based glasses are lower than that of the substrate, the difference in shrinkage caused the glass coating to experience compressive residual stresses. Compressive residual stresses are beneficial, acting to prevent cracks from propagating, thus requiring higher stresses to cause coating failure [115, 116, 117]. On the other hand, the CTE of the silica-based glasses induced tensile residual stresses, promoting the growth of cracks under loading [115, 118]. As shown in Fig. 5.7, the measured bulk GIC of the control glass of the silica-based series, SRT0, was found to be comparable to that of fused silica glass. However, as the percentage of TiO2 in the silica-based glass series was increased, the mean GIC value increased, with significant differences (p < 0.05) observed between the SRT0 and SRT3 (15 mol% incorporated TiO2). There is limited literature available on the mode I critical strain energy release rate (or fracture toughness) of bioactive glasses, specifically on the effect of the inclusion of TiO2 at the expense of the backbone component. The authors hypothesize that the observed increase in the bulk GIC as the amount of TiO2 increased can be attributed to the presence of Ti4+ ions. Incorporation of such ions have been shown to strengthen glass systems and to improve their mechanical properties [119], due to their small ionic radius and high electrical charge [120] that tends to strengthen the bonds in the glass. The bulk GIC of the control glass in the borate series, BRT0,

73

was found not to be significantly different (p < 0.05) from that of SRT0; however, the bulk GIC of the remaining borate-based glasses were lower than their counterpart in the silica-based series. This is not surprising, as previous studies on boro-silicate glasses have shown that the incorporation of B2O3 at the expense of SiO2 can decrease the fracture toughness (directly related to GIC through Eq. 5.7) [121, 122]. Furthermore, similar to silica-based series, the incorporation of TiO2 in the borate series glasses increased the fracture toughness. In terms of the GIC of the coating/substrate system, the presently used DCB testing method was first published by Matinmanesh et al. [70], establishing the GIC for SRT0-based systems at 6.20 ± 0.60 J/m2. The current work expanded on these findings, determining that an increase in TiO2 content resulted in an increase in critical strain energy release rate, peaking at 12.08 ± 1.72 J/m2 for the silica-based coatings, and 18.50 ± 1.60 J/m2 for the borate-based coatings. This work supports the previous findings that titanium in the glass coating enhances chemical bonding to the titanium substrate [68], resulting in a larger measured GIC for the SRT3 and BRT3 systems, both with 15 mol% of TiO2 incorporated. Additionally, the trends of the GIC for the bulk glass and the coating/substrate system are similar, i.e., an increase in incorporated TiO2 translated into an increase in GIC. This is similar to the work of Li et al. [123], who studied the effect of the incorporation of strontium oxide into borate-based glass coatings applied to Ti6Al4V substrates, and found that GIC increased as the amount of strontium oxide increased. The residual stress in the SRT0 coating using the measured values of the CTE was estimated to be 9.6 ± 2.4 MPa (Section 3.2). This is consistent (no significant difference, p < 0.05) with the 8.6 ± 1.0 MPa value found by Matinmanesh et al. [70] for the same SRT0 coating/substrate system using measurements of the radius of curvature of the coated assembly.

74

Comparing the presented GIC values in Fig. 5.7 with those in Fig. 5.9 revealed that the glasses in the silica-based series have higher critical strain energy release rates in bulk form compared to when applied to the coating/substrate. On the contrary, in the borate based series, the GIC was higher for the coating/substrate system. This effect may be attributed to the nature of the residual stresses that are created during the coating process, i.e., tensile in silica-based systems and compressive in borate-based systems (Section 5.3.2), with compressive residual stresses providing additional resistance to crack growth. The bulk hardness of the silica-based glass series decreased as the amount of TiO2 incorporated into the glasses increased, while, in statistical terms, the hardness of the boratebased glasses did not significantly change (p < 0.05) with the addition of TiO2. The hardness of the borate-based glasses however, was significantly higher than the silica-based equivalent glasses at 5 and 15 mol% incorporated TiO2. The decrease in hardness with increasing incorporation of TiO2 is consistent with the observed increase in fracture toughness, which is inversely proportional to the hardness of the glass (Eq. 5.5).

5.5. Chapter Summary
The mechanical properties of the silicate-based and borate-based glasses were determined relevant to their use as coatings on metals. It was observed that borate-based glasses exhibited CTEs that were closer to the substrate's (Ti6Al4V) CTE, a common alloy used in medical implants; this translated into higher mode I critical strain energy release rates for the boratebased glasses and compressive residual stresses and strains at the coating/substrate interface, outperforming the silicate-based glasses counterpart. An increase in the content of TiO2 in the glasses resulted in an increase in the mode I critical strain energy release rate for both the bulk

75

glass and for the coating/substrate system. Borate-based glass BRT3, with 15 mol% TiO2 incorporated, exhibited superior properties overall compared to the other proposed glasses in this work, as well as Bioglass® 45S5 and Pyrex.

6. Conclusions and Future Work

6.1. Conclusions
A silica-based and a borate-based glass series, with increasing amounts of titanium dioxide incorporated, were proposed, processed and evaluated as coatings for metallic implants. The borate-based glasses exhibited improved performance over the silica-based glasses during the biocompatibility and mechanical testing phases of this dissertation. Overall, it was observed that: - Tg of the borate-based glasses was not influenced by the incorporation of titanium dioxide, whereas the crystallization temperature of these glasses was impacted, resulting in greater enameling processing windows compared to the silica-based glasses. - Higher dissolution rates of the borate-based glasses were linked to the greater inhibition zones resulting against S. epidermidis and E. coli bacteria, measured in vitro, with the antibacterial behavior being achieved due to the presence of zinc oxide in these glasses. - Both glass series were found to be nontoxic in vitro to pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, with the silica and borate-based glass series performing similarly, regardless of the content of titanium dioxide. - The coefficients of thermal expansion of the borate-based glasses were lower than that of the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, resulting in compressive residual stresses being induced in the glass when employed as a coating, improving its resistance to crack growth under loading. - Higher contents of titanium dioxide in the glasses was correlated to higher critical strain energy release rates in mode I for the coating/substrate systems for both glass series due

78

to stronger coating-to-substrate bonding facilitated by the Ti4+ ions present in the glasses. Based on these findings, BRT3 (borate-based glass with 15 mol% incorporated titanium dioxide) exhibited overall superior performance in terms of its bioactivity, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties compared to the rest of the proposed glasses, making it suitable as a coating for Ti6Al4V implants. Coating Ti6Al4V with BRT3 is expected to provide for a barrier against bacterial growth, to provide improved mechanical attachment to the substrate, and to promote the proliferation of cells around the implantation site.

6.2. Novel Contributions
Novel silica-based and borate-based glasses incorporating titanium dioxide were formulated to tackle the drawbacks of the prosthetic direct skeletal attachment method, namely, bacterial infection, implant failure and risk of bone fracture. Evidence that these drawbacks were addressed is offered by the superior antibacterial behavior, high degradation rates, and improved adhesion to metallic substrates reported in this dissertation. The dissertation also expanded on the limited literature available around the strength of bioactive glasses. A new method was co-developed by the author to measure the mode I critical strain energy release rate (GIC) of a bioactive glass coating. The measured GIC values for the proposed silica-based glasses were higher than those previously reported in the literature for similar glasses; moreover, substituting SiO2 for B2O3, and incorporating titanium dioxide, further improved GIC. DSA patients who would receive an implant coated with BRT3 glass could experience improved healing and accelerated osseointegration over patients receiving uncoated implants.

79

They will not only be at less risk of bacterial infection at the site of implantation that might require further surgery or implant removal, but the improved strain energy release rate would also allow them to be more confident in their everyday activities.

6.3. Future Work
Though substantial work has been done in vitro to evaluate the glasses and their applicability as coatings, additional tests are required before the proposed bioactive glass can be implemented and tested in human beings. These tests include, but are not limited, to: - Degradation studies using simulated bodily fluids (SBF): As an alternative to degradation in deionized water, SBF can be employed since it more closely matches the composition and pH level of human blood plasma. The effect of SBF could be assessed by determining if a layer of hydroxyapatite (HA) forms around the glass samples, layer which forms part of the inorganic phase of bone and indicates the possibility of glass bonding to bone. - Degradation studies using coated samples: To replicate a scenario that is closer to the real-life application, titanium alloy substrates should be coated with the bioactive glass, then the constructs should undergo degradation using a similar procedure as that used in Chapter 4. After each incubation period, liquid extracts would be removed and tested using AAS to determine the amount of zinc and titanium ions released in these scenarios. Additionally, the coated substrates would be removed and air-dried, then prepared and tested to determine the GIC using the methods of Chapter 5. - In vitro cell proliferation on coated samples: To expand on the results obtained in vitro using preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1, these cells should be seeded on top of a coated

80

sample, and its proliferation should be evaluated then. This would provide information on the effect of the coated surface (roughness, porosity) on the proliferation of MC3T3E1 cells. - Additional mechanical characterization: To complement the GIC, testing in mode II (inplane shear) should be performed since the implantation procedure is likely to induce shear forces on the coating. - In vivo animal studies: At this point, all the experiments have been performed under controlled laboratory conditions. To more closely simulate the conditions within the human body, coated samples should be implanted in small animals to determine the performance of the glass coating in a dynamic setting. In vivo studies offer the advantage of a dynamic testing environment that allows investigation of how the glass simultaneously inhibits bacterial growth, and promotes bone formation in a living organism. A Sprague Dawley comminuted fracture rat module could be used to evaluate the in vivo effects of the coatings on the bone and bone re-growth. Under general anesthesia, a 0.8-mm K-wire would be inserted into the medullary canal of the tibia. Four weeks post-fracture, harvested tibiae would then be subjected to microcomputed tomography for 3D architectural analysis along Van Kossa (quantify mineralization) and Masson's Trichrome (distinguish cells from surrounding tissue) pathology.
