Profit maximization models for a two-level dual-channel supply chain
PhD, 2017 Raaid Batarfi Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Ryerson University

ABSTRACT
Internet-based technologies have changed the way firms do business and manage their supply chains. They have influenced customers' purchase patterns, thereby motivating manufacturers to introduce online channels alongside traditional ones. Such structures are known as dual-channels. Nowadays, an increasing number of manufacturers offer a return policy to attract more customers and to stay competitive. Furthermore, learning-based continuous improvements help firms cope with market changes and be competitive, flexible and efficient. This thesis presents three main models: The first model investigates the effect of adopting a dual-channel (comprised of a retail channel and an online channel) on the performance of a two-level (vendor-retailer) supply chain. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the system by finding the optimal markup margin and inventory decisions before and after adopting the dual-channel. The results show that adding an online channel would increase the profit of the system. However, it creates a conflict due to competition between the retail and online channels. iii Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The second model studies a supply chain system, which is comprised of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. A return policy in which customers can return the purchased item for a refund is also considered. The purpose is to examine the effect of different return policies on the behavior of the system before and after adopting the dual-channel strategy. In both strategies, the model analyzes the change in the profit, the pricing and inventory decisions. The findings demonstrate that the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demand, the selling prices and the overall profit. The third model investigates the effects of learning and forgetting in the vendor's production processes. It also considers single- and dual-channel strategies. Each channel structure can adopt any of six inventory policies. Learning and forgetting effects are considered in all policies except one. The objective is to maximize the profit of the system by finding the joint optimal pricing and inventory decisions. The results suggests that learning, despite being impeded by forgetting, reduces inventory-related costs thereby allowing the chain to reduce the prices of its product(s), which increases demand and subsequently sales.

This chapter provides the basis of the topics that are researched in this thesis. First, it gives a brief overview of the main concepts of supply chain management (SCM), inventory management, and supply chain coordination. Then it gives a more detailed overview of the main subjects that are covered in this thesis, namely: dual-channel supply chain, reverse logistics, and learning and forgetting effects.

1.1 Supply Chain Management (SCM)
The concept of supply chain management (SCM) has risen to prominence over the past two decades due to the substantial interest among researchers and practitioners (Cooper et al., 1997). The concept has been defined in various ways, but most researchers agree that it is the management (oversight) of the flow of materials, (i.e. information, goods, services and financial flow) between different supply chain players. These players can be suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. Effective management of these flows is a challenging task (Lambert, 2008). It requires the collaboration and the coordination of these flows both within and among the supply chain members to achieve a common global decision, that is enhancing and/or optimizing the supply chain system by maximizing (minimizing) the total profit (cost) of the system. In the literature, this type of decision is defined as "centralized decisionÂ­making" In some cases, however, this decision is not aligned with the supply chain players, in which each player attempts to optimize its own objective without considering the objective of the other players in the system. This type of decision is referred to as "decentralized decisionÂ­making". However, this type of decision often leads to insufficient sub-optimal results or conflicts of interest between the different players in the system (Thomas and Griffin, 1996).

1 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

Centralized decisionÂ­making has been extensively studied throughout the literature. The bulk of these studies discussed quantitative models to optimize the total profit (cost) of the supply chain system. Most of these models considered some of the following costs elements: inventory holding costs, ordering costs, purchasing costs, setup costs, production costs, lost sales costs and/or shortages costs. Models build based on a centralized decisionÂ­making may increase (decrease) the profit (cost) of one supply chain player over the other in the system. Therefore, coordination schemes, such as profit sharing or quantity discount can be used to compensate the losing player. The mathematical models in this thesis are built on the concept of centralized decisionÂ­making.

1.2 Inventory Management
Inventory management is considered one of the main aspects that affect the total profit (cost) of the supply chain system. It accounts for almost 50% of that total logistics costs (Jaber and Zolfaghari, 2008). Therefore, modeling inventory management in supply chains is a prime concern for managers, practitioners and researchers. One method to attain inventory management is to coordinate the ordered quantities and the number of shipments in a supply chain, which have been shown to reduce costs, increase profitability and achieve customer satisfaction. There are many models and strategies that can be applied in designing and managing the inventory of the supply chain. The most commonly-used models in this areas are the economic order quantity model (EOQ), and the economic production quantity model (EPQ). The EOQ model was developed by Harris (1915) to optimize the total cost by finding the optimal ordered quantity and holding costs of a supply chain player. This model was then extended by Taft (1918) who introduced the EPQ model (a modification of the EOQ model) in which a finite production rate was assumed. These two models are considered the foundation of more sophisticated inventory models in the literature, such as the joint economic lot size (JELS) models (Glock, 2012). The JELS models are used to 2 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

determine the optimal inventory decisions between different players in the supply chain system. These coordination models are discussed in the next section, and based on their advantages and disadvantages, this thesis selects one model to be used as its focus.

1.3 Supply chain coordination
Coordination is an important element for a successful SCM. In the literature there are different forms of coordination mechanisms that help in coordinating the activities between the different players in the system. Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR), quick response, (QR), vendor-managed inventory (VMI) and consignment stock (CS) policy are some of the initiatives that are used to coordinate product and information flows between the supply chain players. The CPFR policy is a technique "designed to link consumer demand with supply chain planning and execution by promoting a single, jointly owned demand plan and forecast throughout the entire supply chain" (Min and Zhou, 2002, p. 10). The model allows information to be shared between the supply chain players in order to coordinate operations and increase trades while reducing costs and improving client services (Bowersox et al., 2000). The QR policy, a concept derived from the military, was applied to textile, clothing, and footwear industries and is used as a supply chain strategy to improve the speed-to-market of products. It allows the production and delivery of products to move quickly from the supplier, to manufacturers, to retailers, and finally to end users through the use of information technology (IT) and computerized equipment (i.e., electronic data interchange (EDI)). The benefits of using this coordination mechanism is to allow for shorter delivery cycles, lower inventory level and higher customer service level (Perry et al., 1999). 3 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The VMI is an initiative and effective supply chain policy used as a coordination mechanism to allow the vendor (supplier) to manage or monitor the buyer's inventory levels, and make periodic replenishment decisions (such as ordered quantities, number of shipments and replenishment timing) (Fugate et al., 2006). The model has been used by a wide range of companies to increase the efficiency of the supply chain by increasing (decreasing) the profit (cost) and improving the level of customer service. The CS policy has been implemented in different kinds of industries such as automobile and auto parts, consumer electronics, pharmaceutical and papermaking (Liu et al., 2007; Zahran et al., 2015). The CS has also been implemented with other coordination mechanisms such as the VMI. For example, companies such as Wal-Mart, Procter and Gamble, Dell, Barilla, Costco, and Campbell's Soup have revolutionized their relationships with suppliers by using VMI and/or CS policy (Cigolini et al., 2004). Most importantly, the CS is most effective for new and unproven items where fluctuation in demand exist, when the vendor needs to free its inventory to account for other possible items or when sales is questionable such as selling expensive items (Mandal and Giri, 2015). In the CS coordination mechanism, the vendor owns the inventory of the final item and stocks it at the retailer's warehouse, who sells the item to the end users from the consigned inventory and pays the vendor the wholesale price for only the withdrawn quantities that have been sold.

1.4 Dual-channel
The last few decades witnessed remarkable changes in the business world. One of these changes is attributed to the rapid development of the internet and e-commerce technologies, which have been significantly influencing customers' purchase behavior. Such changes led to an increase in the number of manufacturers redesigning their supply chain system and restructuring their 4 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

distribution channels. Many manufacturers today sell their products using a multi-channel strategy such as a traditional retail (indirect) channel, an online (direct) channel or through a dual-channel, which is a mix of both channels. It was forecast that direct online sales in the United States and Canada will reach US$500 billion by 2018 ("Retail Sales Worldwide Will Top $22 Trillion This Year - eMarketer," 2014). This growing size of the e-marketplace is promising; therefore, many manufacturers have been motivated to redesign their supply chain channel distribution through the adoption of an online channel in addition to their existing traditional retail channel (Yao et al., 2005). A dual-channel strategy has helped many manufacturers in increasing their shares of markets by reaching out to different customer segments (Hua et al., 2010). Apple, Dell, Estee Lauder, Hewlett-Packard (hp), IBM, Nike, and Pioneer Electronics are just a few examples of companies that illustrate the adoption of a dual-channel strategy (Tedeschi, 2000; Chiang et al., 2003; Tsay and Agrawal, 2000; Hua et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012, 2013). There are several success factors of an online channel mentioned in the literature. Some of them are measuring its performance, design and implement websites that are user-friendly and accessible, and monitoring the online channels of competitors (Dubelaar et al., 2005). E-commerce technologies have also allowed many manufacturers to be more interactive with customers, understand their individual needs and preferences, and deliver products that are individually customized to their specific requirements (i.e. mass-customized items) (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2004; Liu et al., 2012). Mass customization (MC) is an industrial system practice, triggered by advances in information technologies (IT), flexible manufacturing system (FMS) and computer-aided

design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) to produce a wide range of customized items at a cost that is close (but higher) to mass produced ones (Liu et al., 2012; Batarfi et al., 2016). In practice, successful MC companies build products from combining preassembled components, which the 5 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

literature refers to as build-to-order (BTO). Most manufacturers that offer BTO customized items do not consider offering them as an isolated business strategy, but alongside an existing standardized production strategy. The motivation behind this is to enrich the capability portfolio of the manufacturer, which will increase their market share and improve their profit. For example, manufacturers such as Apple, Dell, and Nike coupled a MC strategy with a dual-channel strategy to increase their competitiveness and market share, thereby generating more profit (Salvador et al., 2009; Shao, 2013). Manufacturers adopting a dual-channel strategy and offering identical items to those of the retail channels through online channels risk losing their retail partners who feel threatened by competition (Takahashi et al., 2011). When a dual-channel supply chain is adopted, the problem of managing the inventory of the supply chain becomes more complex, in which the online channel may cause difficulties that could cannibalize the retailer's market share and impact the inventory decisions (Takahashi et al., 2011). Manufacturers, therefore, are required to redesign their supply chain structure and, accordingly, determine their pricing strategy and their inventory decisions. Although it would seem that the adoption of an online channel would create conflict between the retailer and the manufacturer, or that it will affect the retailer's market share, studies have shown that the introduction of an online channel will most likely result in a reduction in the wholesale price of the product sold through the retail channel, and increase the supply chain's total profit, thus benefiting both firms in the end (Hua et al., 2010; Shao, 2013). A reduction in the wholesale price may also indicate that the seller has reduced its total cost, or its markup margin, a percentage above the unit cost of a product; therefore, establishing an accurate markup is an imperative part of the pricing strategy.

1.5 Reverse logistics supply chain
The importance of managing the inventory of the supply chain has received tremendous attention from researchers and businesses. However, this attention, in most cases, is concentrated on managing the inventory of the forward logistics (FL) of an item from the point-of-origin (i.e., vendor) to the point-of-consumption (i.e., consumers) (Agrawal et al., 2015). Recently, however, the scope of the supply chain has been extended to include managing the inventory of items from consumers to the point-of-origin, known as reverse logistics (RL) (Agrawal et al., 2015). RL involves products that fall into two categories. The first deals with products that are returned by customers to the point-of-origin either because the products failed to function as designed or because the customers, for whatever other reasons, are not satisfied with them. In most cases, these returned items are sold to a secondary market as repaired or refurbished items (Cheng and Lee, 2010). The second category deals with products that are collected from customers for the purpose of recovery (remanufacturing, recycling, disposal, etc.) once they have reached the end of their useful lives (Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006; Agrawal et al., 2015). Offering a return policy, in which customers can return the purchased items for a refund, has been used as an important marketing tool and a competitive strategy to substantially increase customer satisfaction and improve product sales (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2004). A return policy can take many forms such as full or partial refund of the selling price, exchanging the item, store credit or no refund whatsoever (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2004). In practice, the type of return policy may vary from business to business or from one industry to another. It also depends on the type of item. For example, in the computer industry, Dell Computers offers a full return policy that allows its customers to return purchased items, even customized ones. Apple Computers, on the other hand, for most of its products, offers a full return policy on non-customized items, and no 7 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

return for special custom orders (e.g. engraving on iPad) (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2005). Companies that establish a return policy as a competitive tool need to recognize its impact on the selling prices and the supply chain inventory decisions. Recently, RL has received a growing importance by many researchers and firms for its economic benefits, competitive advantage and corporate social image (Agrawal et al., 2015). However, managing the RL of a supply chain is significantly more complex than managing a traditional FL supply chain (Krumwiede and Sheu, 2002). This complexity is due to the lack of resources and/or the capabilities to manage returned items from customers. It can substantially increase the cost of the supply chain. Due to this complexity, many firms (such as K-mart, Best Buy and Philips) have outsourced the RL part of their supply chains to third-party logistics (3PL) providers (such as GENCO, Ryder, UPS and OZARK) to reduce cost and ensure an effective RL process (Cheng and Lee, 2010; Krumwiede and Sheu, 2002; Olorunniwo and Li, 2011). Firms have relied on 3PL providers for logistic operations (e.g., transportation) for many years. However, the reliance on 3PL providers for RL is fairly new (Bloomberg et al., 2001; Prahinski and Kocabasoglu, 2006). For example, in the computer and electronic industry, Thomson Consumer Electronics outsourced its RL part of the supply chain to a 3PL provider, GENCO, to facilitate returns and for the refurbishment of repairable items in Mexico; unrepairable items are disposed of in the US before they are shipped to Mexico (Dhanda and Hill, 2005). As well, Cerplex Group built a RL and repair system business to provide services for the computer and electronics industry that range from the handling of returned items to the refurbishments and repairs of these items (Dhanda and Hill, 2005). Similarly, Philips outsourced the collection, repairing, repackaging, refurbishing and disposition of returned items to a 3PL provider, Ryder Supply Chain Solutions (Sharma et al., 2012). It was proven that firms that outsourced their RL to 3PL providers 8 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

reduced their annual logistics cost up to 10% (Krumwiede and Sheu, 2002), and were able to reduce inventories and improve field engineering productivity by up to 40% (Cheng and Lee, 2010). Martin, Guide, & Craighead (2010) reported that remanufacturing was traditionally performed by independent small and privately owned 3PL remanufacturers; however, some original equipment manufacturer (OEM) prefer to remanufacture in-house for several reasons. For example, they noted that Caterpillar established a remanufacturing decision for its products to gain a competitive edge in a growing lower-price market segment. They also mentioned that when the products contain high levels of proprietary technology, firms remanufacture in-house to avoid the exposure of these components; Xerox is one such company. For the purposes of this thesis, it is assumed that the 3PL remanufacturing facility is a division of the parents company, such that legal concerns about intellectual property are not a concern.

1.6 Learning and forgetting effects on supply chain
To maintain a sustainable and effective supply chain, many companies implement continuous improvement programs such as fostering organizational learning within the operations of the supply chain. Learning-based continuous improvement programs improve competitiveness by eliminating inefficiencies and thus reducing costs (Jaber et al., 2010). Learning-by-doing is fundamental to these programs and to improving the overall (including production) efficiency (Jaber, 2011), especially in labor intensive and ramp-up processes (Glock et al., 2012), in which continuous improvements are needed. Learning also improves the overall efficiency of the supply chain in areas where new products are introduced or where a new production system is implemented (Glock et al., 2012). The learning phenomenon in earlier studies focused mainly on the behavior of individual subjects (Jaber and Bonney, 1999). The phenomenon is captured by a

9 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

learning curve (LC) and suggests that the time required to perform a repetitive task declines with experience (Jaber, 2011). The application of LC in various industrial settings resulted in different LC forms (Jaber, 2011; Grosse et al., 2015). For example, some of these LC forms have been known as "progress function" (Glover, 1965), "start-up curve" (Baloff, 1970), "improvement curve" (Steedman, 1970), and "power form or aircraft learning curve" (Wright, 1936). The power-form LC, or Wright learning curve (WLC) (Wright, 1936) remains the most favored among researchers and practitioners. The WLC quantitatively formulates the relationship between learning variables. In general, the LC has been applied to a diverse set of industries and management decision areas to better make use of resources, coordinate and dispatch inventory, and manage production and distribution with the end goal being to improve the overall system productivity and reduce the costs involved therein (Jaber and El Saadany, 2011). Although the learning phenomenon improves production efficiency and minimizes cost, its opposite phenomenon, "forgetting", impedes it (Jaber, 2006a). Changes in products and processes, production interruptions, job rotations, knowledge interference, and labor turnover are among the reasons for loss of knowledge or forgetting, which impedes performance and increases costs (Jaber, 2011; SikstrÃ¶m and Jaber, 2012).

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter presents an overview of the literature related to the intended thesis. The overview is classified mainly on three streams of research. The first stream of research, overviews studies that have considered investigating the effects of adopting a dual-channel strategy on the supply chain system, in different cases. The second stream of research overviews studies that have considered investigating inventory management issues in the reverse logistics (RL) supply chain system. The third stream of research overviews studies that have considered investigating the learning and forgetting effects on the supply chain system, specifically in the joint economic lot size (JELS) problem.

2.1 Dual-channel supply chain
In the last few years, research on dual-channel supply chains has gained considerable attention in the supply chain management (SCM) literature. Most of the studies have focused on pricing decisions and channel coordination. This thesis is related to this stream of research. Earlier studies that are related to this type of pricing and channel structure/coordination problem appear in the work of Chiang et al. (2003) and Tsay and Agrawal (2004) who considered pricing and channel structure as decision variables. In the first study, Chiang et al. (2003) argued that the introduction of an online channel can induce the retailer to decrease its price, which in return increases the demand for the retail channel and consequently increases the profit of the manufacturer (even if no sale occurs in the online channel). Their main finding indicated that the strategic use of the online channel increases channel efficiency. In the second study, Tsay and Agrawal (2004) extended the work of Chiang et al. (2003) by incorporating the unit cost of supplying a product while studying channel conflict and service interaction between the upstream and the downstream players in a dual-channel supply chain setting. They showed that the direct channel would benefit 11 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

both the vendor and the retailer if the wholesale price were to be adjusted; however, this benefit depends on the channels' sales effort. Fruchter and Tapiero (2005) on the other hand, studied the pricing policy for a dual-channel supply chain using dynamic hierarchal game theory. Their optimal finding indicated that the vendor can charge the same price across both channels, and found that customers' heterogeneity affects the direct channel price, the retailer's markup and supply chain profitability. Cattani et al. (2006) investigated pricing strategies for a vendor who competes with a traditional retail channel by adding a direct online channel. The authors proposed a generalized equal-pricing strategy in which the selling price of an item in the online channel matches the retailer's price. Their findings indicated that the proposed equal-pricing strategy maximizes the vendor's profit and is preferred by the retailer and customers. Kurata et al. (2007) explored cross-brand and cross-pricing policies in multiple distribution channels. They considered channel competition between a national brand (NB) and store brand (SB). They assumed that the NB could be distributed through a direct online channel as well as an indirect retail channel, whereas the SB can be distributed only through the indirect retail channel. Their findings showed that building brand loyalty is profitable for both the NB and the SB, and that marketing decisions are more restrictive for the NB than they are for the SB. The benefits of demand sharing and channel coordination have been investigating in the supply chain literature. For example, Yao and Liu (2003) and Yue and Liu (2006) studied the benefits of demand diffusion and demand sharing between an online channel and a retail channel. The first study proved how the demand between the two channels could be stable under some conditions. The second study investigated pricing and production quantity of a dual-channel supply chain and found that the online channel has a negative impact on the performance of the retailer. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008), on the other hand, presented a game-theoretic model to investigate 12 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

optimal contract design for a two-level dual-channel supply chain (vendor-retailer) under two cases: complete information and asymmetric information sharing. They studied the optimal pricing decisions and the retailer's added value to its product offering to differentiate itself from the vendor. Their findings showed when information asymmetry is considered, the selling price in the direct channel does not change while the selling price in the retail channel increases. Cai (2010) investigated channel selection and coordination contract in a two-level dual-channel supply chain. The author considered four channel structures: (1) a traditional retail channel, (2) a direct online channel, (3) a dual-channel with a direct and a retail channels and (4) a dual-channel with two retailers. One of his key findings suggested that channel structures with and without coordination depend on factors such as the base demand, the operational costs and channel substitutability. Similarly, Chen et al. (2012) implemented coordination contracts in a dual-channel supply chain using a Stackelberg scenario (where one firm is the leader, and the other is a follower). They examined pricing decisions and found that the dual-channel supply chain increases the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer while improving the overall supply chain efficiency under some circumstances. Lei et al. (2014) studied vertical and horizontal demand information sharing and channel structure in a dual-channel supply chain. They found that the retailers have the incentive to share information under horizontal integration but not under vertical integration. Chen et al. (in press) explored the impact of pricing and product quality on three channel structures: (1) a traditional retail channel, (2) a direct online channel and (3) a dual-channel. They modeled each channel structure under centralized and decentralized decision-making system. Their results showed that in the centralized scenario, the direct online channel provides the highest quality level and selling price among the three-channel structure. However, in the decentralized scenario, the price and quality level depend on factors that are related to channel relative power, quality

13 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

coefficient and channel substitutability. Recently, Li et al. (2016a) investigated pricing strategies and channel coordination for a two-level supply chain (supplier-retailer) in which the supplier is risk-neutral and the retailer is risk-averse. Using a Stackelberg game model they obtained the equilibrium solutions in two scenarios (decentralized and centralized). Their findings indicated the selling price will decrease and that the supplier initial stock will increase when the retailer becomes more risk-averse. Pricing policies in a dual-channel supply chain were also investigated under environmental factors. For example, Li et al. (2016b) examined pricing policies in a dual-channel supply chain when the vendor produces green items for the environmentally-conscious. They analyzed pricing decisions under centralized and decentralized settings. Their main findings indicated that the vendor should open the online channel when the greening costs and customers' loyalty to the retail channel satisfy certain conditions. Ji et al. (2017) investigated pricing and the carbon emission reduction decisions in a single-channel and a dual-channel supply chain system. The study considered cap-and-trade regulations and consumers' low-carbon preference. Their results suggested that the introduction of the vendor's online channel is profitable when the degree of consumers' low-carbon sensitivity satisfies certain conditions. They also showed that when consumers have low-carbon preference, the cap-and-trade mechanism is acceptable for the supply chain players. Pricing decisions in a dual-channel supply chain have also been investigated under demand and/or product disruption, (Huang et al., 2012, 2013; Cao, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Matsui, 2016). For example, Huang et al. (2012, 2013) investigated pricing and production decisions in a dual-channel supply chain under centralized and decentralized settings and considered demand disruption and production cost disruption, respectively. In the first study, they found that the optimal production plan has some robustness when demand is disrupted. Production and pricing plans are adjusted 14 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

only when the change in the market scale exceeds a threshold. In the second study, they found that pricing and production quantity are disrupted when production cost disruption exceeds a threshold value. Cao (2014) examined optimal decisions (pricing and production) and coordination for a dual-channel supply chain with and without demand disruption and proposed an improved revenue-sharing contract. His results recommended adjusting the prices and the production quantities. Along the same stream of research, Zhang et al. (2015) examined the coordination of dual-channel supply chains when demand and production cost are disrupted using a contract. They found that by adjusting the parameters of the contract, coordination is still possible with disruptions. Matsui (2016), on the other hand, investigated the optimal product distribution for two symmetric manufacturers facing price competition and using dual-channel supply chains. Their main findings indicated that an asymmetric distribution policy for a manufacturer encountering price competition is not necessarily optimal. Researchers also investigated channels' competitions and the mitigation of the effect of adopting an online channel on the retail channel. In this area Chen et al. (2008), Dumrongsiri et al. (2008) Yan and Pei (2009) and Dan et al. (2012) studied the strategic role of the retail services and channel competition in a dual-channel supply chain system. Chen et al. (2008) found that the optimal channel strategy of the manufacturer depends on the channel environment and that the retail channel generates less profit than the direct channel. Dumrongsiri et al. (2008) showed that adding an online channel in a centralized case can increase the overall profit. They also showed that increasing the quality of the retailer's service can increase the vendor's profit. Similarly, Yan and Pei (2009) suggested that the retail service directly affects the overall profit of the system and the pricing strategies of the vendor and the retailer. Likewise, Dan et al. (2012) presented a model for retail service and pricing policy in centralized and decentralized dual-channel supply chains to test 15 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

the effects of the retail service and the degree of customers' loyalty on the retail channel. Their findings showed that retail service has a direct effect on the overall profit of the supply chain system and on the pricing strategies of both the vendor and the retailer. Chen (2015) evaluated the effect of pricing and cooperative advertising policies on a two-level dual-channel supply chain system. Their results showed that the total profits of both channels are highly sensitive to the level of local advertising. On examining the effect of delivery lead-time in a dual-channel supply chain, Hua et al. (2010) investigated the optimal prices of a dual-channel supply chain under centralized and decentralized settings while taking into consideration the delivery lead-time. They found that the delivery lead-time affects pricing strategies and the supply chain profit. They also found that customer acceptance of the online channel has a great effect on the supply chain. The research of this thesis is also largely related to the literature on channel coordination when standardized and customized products are sold. In this area, Xia and Rajagopalan (2009) investigated the standardization and customization of two competing firms by incorporating consumer heterogeneity, product variety, delivery lead-time and price. Their results showed that increasing product variety or decreasing delivery lead-time can increase market share and margin. Shao (2013) explored the effectiveness of a mass customization (MC) strategy and the conditions under which the manufacturing firm should offer customization. The study was analyzed under centralized and decentralized decision-making situations. His findings showed that the introduction of a MC strategy in a centralized setting increased the expected profit of the system by reducing the average costs of the standard items. Xiao et al. (2014) used a Stackelberg pricing model to investigate product variety and channel structure in which the retail channel sells standard products and the online channel offers customized products. They found that when the reservation price in the retail channel was sufficiently low, the unit wholesale and the retail prices of a standard 16 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

item sold through a retail channel were increased due to the introduction of an online channel for customized items. In a study of a two-level supply chain (vendor-retailer), Li et al. (2015) investigated firms' decisions on offering customization through an online channel based on customers' acceptance level of that channel and customers' sensitivity to product differences. A key finding was that it is not necessary that the price of the standard product offered by the retailer decrease due to offering a customized product online. They also found, under some conditions, that when the manufacturer offered customized products online, the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer improved due to alleviated vertical competition and an increase in the market share. This thesis also largely relates to the literature on inventory control and management of multichannel supply chains. Here is a brief review of the literature. Chiang and Monahan (2005) proposed a two-echelon dual-channel supply chain model for a vendor and a retailer. They applied a lot-for-lot (LFL) replenishment policy where the stock is kept at the vendor's warehouse and sent to the buyer on an "as needed" basis. In their model, the total cost consisted of the sum of the inventory holding cost and lost sales, with no consideration for setup cost and ordering cost. They found that a dual-channel strategy outperformed a single-channel strategy. Takahashi et al. (2011) also proposed a new inventory control policy for a two-echelon dual-channel supply chain by considering production setup and delivery costs as part of the total cost of the supply chain. They calculated the total cost of the system using Markov analysis and showed that the proposed model could reduce the number of setups with no additional increase in the inventory levels of the vendor and the retailer. Ryan et al. (2013) analyzed the optimal price and order quantity for a two-level dual-channel supply chain using a newsvendor problem. They proposed two revenue-sharing contracts to enable coordination. RodrÃ­guez and Aydin (2015) analyzed pricing and assortment decisions in a dual-channel SC. They accounted for inventory related costs, but did not specify an 17 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

inventory policy. Their results showed that adopting a dual-channel increased the manufacturer's market share and profit. However, they discussed that the two channels compete with one another with conflicting objectives between the manufacturer and the retailer: the first pushing the retailer for storing items with high demand variability, with the latter pushing for low variability. Yang et al. (2016) investigated inventory completion of a perishable item in a two-level (vendor-retailer) dual-channel supply chain using a newsvendor model, and considered the delivery lead-time, the retailer's ordered quantity and the vendor's inventory level as decision variables. They compared the optimal decisions in two scenarios: centralized and decentralized. They found that at least one of the supply chain members will overstock in the decentralized scenario as compared with the centralized scenario. They also found that customers in the decentralized scenario enjoy a better service in the online channel by having a shorter delivery lead-time.

2.2 Reverse logistics (RL) supply chain
In the literature, reverse logistics (RL), which falls under the umbrella of closed loop supply chain, is considered a separate line of research. This line of research, which grew in the late twentieth century, includes all aspects of managing a business, including the inventory parts of the supply chain. The research in this thesis relates to the literature that considered a RL supply chain in either single or dual-channel structures and examined the pricing of products, return policy, and/or inventory decisions. Readers can refer to Prahinski and Kocabasoglu (2006) and Agrawal et al. (2015) for a complete literature review on the RL supply chain. It was reported that more than 56% of the RL research considered the problems of production planning and inventory management (Rubio et al., 2008). In the literature, there are numerous mathematical models that considered RL supply chains with inventory models, based on the economic order/production quantity (EOQ/EPQ) (Bazan et al., 2016). The research in this thesis is largely related to this stream of 18 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

research in which it considers investigating inventory models for the forward and the reverse flow of the material. To the best of the author's knowledge, the research in this thesis did not come across a study that models inventory management in a RL for items returned by unsatisfied customers and/or using a dual-channel strategy. However, there are multiple studies that considered RL with inventory management models for end-of-life (EOL) items that are collected from customers for the purpose of recovery or recycling. Although these studies do not directly relate to the research on this thesis, the ideas brought by these studies could be useful. In this research area, it is believed that Schrady (1967) made the initial attempt to investigate a reverse logistic supply chain for a repair inventory system. The author developed a deterministic EOQ model for repaired items and assumed a fixed return rate. A flurry of articles extended the work of Schrady (1967) and accounted for other aspects of inventory problems. For example, Nahmias and Rivera (1979) extended the work of Schrady (1967) by accounting for a finite return rate and a limited storage capacity in the production and repair shops. In the late of 1990s Richter (1996a, 1996b) developed two EOQ repair and waste disposal models. In the first study, the author assumed that the demand could be satisfied from newly-produced and repaired used items. The second study included the case of variable setup numbers. Following these two studies, Richter (1997) extended his earlier work by assuming extreme waste disposal rates. His results showed that a pure (bang-bang) policy of either total repair (no waste disposal) or full waste disposal (no repair) is more beneficial than a mixed strategy. Along the same line of research, Teunter (2001, 2002, 2004), extended the work of Schrady (1967) by investigating a deterministic EOQ inventory system for items that can be recovered (repaired/refurbished/remanufactured). In the first study, the author assumed more than one manufacturing batch and different holding costs rates for manufactured and recovered items. In the second study, the author investigated a discounted cost

19 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

inventory system and used a stochastic model in which the demand and returns rates follow a distribution that represents randomness. In the third study, the author developed a lot-sizing inventory system with product recovery, in which recovered items are assumed to be as-good-asnew. The developed model was valid for finite and infinite production rates. Similarly, Dobos and Richter (2003, 2004, 2006) extended the work of Richter (1997) and developed a productionrecycling model with stationary demand and return rates. They assumed that the demand can be satisfied from newly produced and recycled items and that non-recycled items are disposed of. Their first study considered that in each time interval there is a single production and a single repair cycle. In the second study, they developed a more generalized model to consider multiple cycles per time interval. In their third study, quality consideration was taking into account. Later, Mitra (2009) considered a return policy for EOL items in a two-level RL supply chain to find the optimal value of the inventory variables under deterministic and stochastic settings. Through a simulation study, he showed that the model performs very well with respect to the optimal solutions. El Saadany and Jaber (2010, 2011) proposed two RL inventory models in which the demand is satisfied from newly produced items and remanufactured EOL items (where remanufactured items are assumed to be as-good-as-new). The first study considered that the return rate depends on the price and the quality of the product and showed that a mixed strategy of production and remanufacturing is optimal compared to a pure strategy. The second study considered that collected used items are disassembled into components, which are then used in the production and remanufacturing processes. In this study, they showed that a pure production or remanufacturing policy is more optimal than a mixed strategy. In the same stream of research, Jaber and El Saadany (2009) and Hasanov et al. (2012) developed a RL supply chain model, where production, remanufacturing and waste disposal processes are considered. They assumed that

20 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

newly produced and remanufactured "repaired" items are of incompatible quality and hence, the demand for both items is different. In the first study, lost sales scenario for stock-out periods of manufactured and remanufactured items are considered. This results in a shortage of remanufactured (manufactured) items over the manufacturing (remanufacturing) segment of the production cycle. The second study assumed that stock-out situations are met through a full or partial backorder. The results of Jaber and El Saadany (2009) suggested that the collection of used items from the secondary market is only optimal for certain values of the input parameters (e.g., setup costs, holding costs, etc). One main finding of Hasanov et al. (2012) is that when there are several production and manufacturing batches in an interval, an optimal policy can occur. Jaber et al. (2014) extended the model of production, remanufacturing and waste disposal system by considering a two-level (vendor-retailer) RL supply chain with a consignment stock (CS) policy as a coordination mechanism. Their finding showed that both the collection and repair rates of used items have a significant impact on both the total cost and the batch size. For more literature review on the mathematical inventory models in RL, readers can refer to the work of Bazan et al. (2016). Other researchers investigated the use of an online channel to sell returned items. In this research area, Choi et al. (2004) investigated the optimal return policy of a two-level supply chain where returned items from the retailer to the vendor could be sold on an e-marketplace. Through a simulation study, they showed this practice to be very profitable. They also showed that optimal solutions of the problem exist under some conditions. For example, the selling price of the returned items on the e-marketplace should be set when the actual amount of returned items is known. Using an online direct channel strategy, Li et al. (2013) examined the relationship between return policy, product quality and pricing strategies and its impact on customer's purchase and return decisions. 21 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

Their main findings indicated that when product quality improves, the direct online channel should provide a lenient return policy and can increase the selling prices. Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro (2004) developed a profit maximization model for a RL supply chain in an e-business context. They studied optimal pricing decisions and return policy regarding certain market reaction parameters. From their result, a number of managerial insights were derived based on the optimum price and return policy that can maximize the total profit of the supply chain. One year later, Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro (2005) developed another RL supply chain model. However, they considered a BTO (build-to-order) product produced from pre-assembled modules and sold to customers through an online channel. They analyzed the effect of two decision variables, namely return policy and modularity level, on the demand, the refund amount returned to customers and the overall profit of the supply chain. Their results showed that offering a higher return policy and/or a higher modularity level, can increase the revenue and the total cost of the returned items. Liu et al. (2012) extended the work of Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro (2005) and developed an analytical model to investigate optimal pricing, modularity and return policy under MC environment. Through a sensitivity analysis, they showed that when the primary demand increases, the decision variables in their model decrease. Yao et al. (2005) estimated the optimal ordered quantities and return policy for a two-level supply chain (vendor-retailer) with the addition of a direct channel under two cases: information sharing and non-information sharing. They found that when the vendor shares information with the retailer, the return policy remains unchanged regardless of customer shift between the two channels. They also found that the total profit of the supply chain in the information sharing case is higher than in the non-information sharing case. Ofek et al. (2011) examined the impact of product return, pricing strategies and physical store assistance levels of two retailers under the adoption of a dual-channel strategy. They indicated that

22 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

when product differentiation between the two retailers is not too high, opening an online channel could increase the investment in store assistance level and decrease profits. Using different return policies Chen and Bell (2012) showed how customer returns could enhance the profit of the firm and impact the optimal pricing and ordering decisions of the firm. Ketzenberg and Zuidwijk (2009) studied optimal pricing, ordering and return policies for consumer goods in two demand cases: deterministic and stochastic. They showed that the results of the stochastic demand case do not give further insight. They also showed that errors in the parameters related to demand and purchase cost have a great impact on the expected profit. Using a buyback policy contract, Liu et al. (2014) examined the impact of returned unsold items from the retailer and returned items from customers, on the coordination of a two-level supply chain and under demand uncertainty. They showed that the optimal refund amount, the ordered quantity and the total profit in a centralized decision are always much higher than in a decentralized decision. Environmental concerns were also examined in a RL dual-channel supply chain. In this area, He et al. (2016) investigated the impact of consumer free riding behavior on carbon emissions in a closed loop dual-channel supply chain system. Consumer free riding occur when customers enjoy the retail service but they make purchases from the online channel due to cost saving. The authors analyzed the effect of governmental e-commerce tax on carbon emissions. Their results showed that even though the vendor may gain economic advantages from consumer free riding, the supply chain's total carbon emissions increased. They suggested that imposing a governmental tax on e-commerce can reduce consumer free riding and total carbon emissions. Some other studies in RL supply chain considered the benefits of outsourcing the RL part of the supply chain to another firm. For example, Krumwiede and Sheu (2002) proposed a model for a RL supply chain and showed how companies that would like to pursue RL could use a third party 23 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

logistics (3PL) provider for all or portions of their RL. Savaskan et al. (2004) considered the problem of choosing the right channel structure (manufacturer, retailer, or 3PL) for the collection of used EOL items from customers. They analyzed the optimal decisions of the supply chain members under three channels and compared the retail price, the wholesale price, the return rate and the profit gained by selling the returned used items to evaluate the merits of the three channels. They showed that the retailer is the most effective undertaker for the collection of EOL items. Cheng and Lee (2010) presented a systematic approach to examine the importance of RL requirements and to select the appropriate 3PL provider. Through a case study, they showed that IT management is an imperative requirement that should be considered when outsourcing RL to a 3PL. In another study by Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2006), they examined the optimal pricing decisions (including buyback price of retuned items) and the return policy decisions when the RL part of the supply chain is outsourced to a fourth-party logistics (4PL) provider, who is responsible for refurbishing all returned items. Managerial insights were provided using marketing and operational strategy variables to show how a manager can influence some market parameters (provided in their model) to obtain the optimal prices, return policy and outsourced fees paid to the 4PL. The literature does not provide a clear distinction between 3PL and 4PL. The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) defines 3PL as the companies integrating and offering subcontracted logistics and transportation services. 4PL differs from 3PL as representing an interface between a client and multiple logistics service providers.

2.3 The learning and forgetting effects
For almost seven decades, the learning curve (LC) phenomena have been extensively discussed and used by many researchers and practitioners (Jaber et al., 2010). The phenomena provide a managerial technique and the means to model, quantify and predict the continuous improvement 24 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

of products and services (Jaber and Bonney, 2003). The theory in its most popular form states that production time per unit of an item declines by a constant percentage when the total quantity of the produced item doubles (Jaber and Guiffrida, 2004). The literature discussed three main LC model types: power models, hyperbolic models and exponential models. However, a unanimous agreement among researchers stated that the power form proposed by Wright (Wright, 1936) is the first, most widely used and accepted model to formulate learning effects in a quantitative way due to its simplicity and efficiency (Yelle, 1979). Most studies confirmed that as the learning rate (LR) increases, the systems productivity improves and, therefore, reduces the systems cost. These studies also confirmed that it is beneficial for the supply chain system to produce in smaller lots more frequently (Jaber and Bonney, 1999; Jaber, 2011). However, although learning reduces costs and improves systems productivity, this improvement is impeded when forgetting is considered. In the last decade, researchers in industrial engineering extended the LC theory by given considerable attentions to its opposite phenomenon, the forgetting curve (FC) (Jaber and Guiffrida, 2004). These extensions introduced new parameters that adjusted the prediction of Wright's LC model, which, as suggested by Globerson et al. (1989) and Jaber and Bonney (1996), may be considered as a mirror image of the LC model. Both theories (i.e. LC and FC) have been investigated in different industrial settings such as lotsizing problem (Jaber and Bonney, 1999), dual resource constrained system (Jaber et al., 2003), production quality (Jaber and Guiffrida, 2004), supplier quality (Jaber et al., 2008), supply chain coordination (Jaber et al., 2010) and order picking (logistics) (Grosse et al., 2013). The use of LC and FC to study its effects on the lot-sizing problems can be found as early as the 1960s. For example, Keachie and Fontana (1966) were the first to study the effects of learning and forgetting in an EPQ model where production is intermittent. They studied three different cases (full transfer, 25 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

partial transfer, and no transfer) of LC. This work was followed by articles in the 70s and 80s to regain interest in the 1990s. For example, Adler and Nanda (1974a, 1974b) investigated the effect of production breaks on the optimal lot-sizing determination for a single and multi-product scenarios and proposed two refined mathematical models (equal lot sizes and equal production interval). Globerson et al. (1989), on the other hand, investigated the relation between production breaks and forgetting and found that the degree of forgetting is a function of the level of experience prior to the break and the length of the production break. Although these articles discussed different situations, they have a common finding that learning suggests producing in smaller, more frequent lots and that learning decreases costs. Forgetting as a result of production breaks does the opposite. Jaber and Bonney (1999) provided a review of inventory models with learning and forgetting effects, with Adler and Nanda (1974b) being the only study that investigated multiple products. Furthermore, Jaber and Bonney (1996) developed a mathematical model referred to as the learnforget curve model (LFCM). The LFCM was tested by many researchers to investigate its effects in different cases on the lot-sizing problems (Jaber and Bonney, 2007; Jaber and Guiffrida, 2007; Khan et al., 2010). It has also satisfactorily proven that learning and forgetting are mirror images of each other (Jaber, 2011). Moreover, the LFCM was shown to produce better results than other models considered in the literature (Jaber and Bonney, 1997; Jaber, 2016). A few of the inventory models reviewed in Jaber and Bonney (1999) were extended to consider two or more players. For example, Nanda and Nam (1992, 1993) examined the JELS model for a vendor and a retailer (or multi-retailers). They considered a LFL policy with quantity discount. For simplicity, they assumed forgetting to be a constant percentage of cumulative experience. Readers may refer to Glock (2012) for a comprehensive review on JELS models. Jaber et al. (2010) studied the effects of learning-based continuous improvements in a coordinated three-level supply 26 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

chain (supplier-vendor-retailer) where learning and forgetting occur in setup, production, and product quality. They showed that as improvement becomes faster, the manufacturer offers the retailer a discount to order in smaller quantities. Jaber and Bonney (2011, chap. 14) provided an updated version of (Jaber and Bonney, 1999) that covers the literature up until 2011. Of the works that did not appear in (Jaber and Bonney, 2011) and of importance to this thesis is the work of Zanoni et al. (2012) who investigated VMI-CS (a vendor-managed inventory (VMI) with CS policy) for a two-level (vendor-retailer) supply chain with learning and forgetting in the production process of the vendor. Three different production and shipment cases were suggested. They showed that learning in production gives flexibility to the supply chain members by assigning the size and the time of the shipment. Other recent studies that considered learning and/or forgetting are those of Khan et al. (2012, 2014), who investigated the effect of different human factors (e.g. learning in quality and production) on the performance of a two-level supply chain. Their main results indicated that accounting for the learning factor brings in a substantial drop in the total cost of the supply chain. For the convenience of the reader, Table 2.1 summarises the literature relevant to this thesis. It classifies the literature by the following sub-headings: dual-channel, the type of product (standard and/or customized), pricing decision, inventory decision, inventory policy, the use of reverse logistics, the implementation of learning and forgetting effects, and the investigation of other decision variables.

CHAPTER 3. RESEARCH GAPS
As seen from the above-reviewed literature (Chapter 2), it is apparent that dual-channel supply chains have frequently been studied in different situations. However, most studies reported in the literature in this area are general economic models in which important cost factors such as inventory holding costs and other related operational costs (i.e. setup and ordering costs) are ignored. It was proven that when these costs are ignored, the results of these general economic models do not hold anymore (Reyniers, 2001). To fulfill the gaps lacking in this area, the research in this thesis investigates the effect of a dual-channel strategy on the profit of a two-level (vendorretailer) supply chain system in the presence of inventory costs in both channels. The dual-channel strategy here is composed of a vendor and a retailer and deals with two channels in which the retail channel offers a standard items, and the online channel offers customized items. Three main models were developed. These models are presented in the next three chapters as follows: Chapter 4 investigates the optimal pricing decision (by finding the optimal markup margin), and the optimal inventory decisions (optimal ordered/production quantity and the number of shipments) before and after adopting the dual-channel supply chain system. The content of this chapter is published in a peer-reviewed journal (Applied Mathematical Modelling, 40(21), 9454-9473; doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2016.06.008). Chapter 5 builds on the work of the previous chapter (Batarfi et al. (2016)), by modeling a more complex supply chain structure to account for the returns of newly produced and refurbished standard and customized items (four return flows). Specifically, Chapter 5 investigates the effect of different return policies on the pricing strategy, optimal inventory decisions and the profits of a reverse logistics dual-channel supply chain and

32 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

in the presence of inventory, refurbishing, outsourcing, and disposal costs. The content of this chapter is published in a peer-reviewed journal (Computers & Industrial Engineering, 106, 58Â­82; doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2017.01.024). Chapter 6 investigates the effects of learning and forgetting on the performance of a dual-channel supply chain. Two main strategies are investigated (i.e., single- and dual-channel strategies). For each strategy, six different policies are investigated. The first policy discusses the behavior of both inventories without considering learning and forgetting effects. The other policies discuss five different shipment arrangements between the vendor and the retailer when learning and forgetting effects are considered. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the supply chain system by finding the optimal pricing and inventory decisions. The content of this chapter was submitted for review in a peer-reviewed journal. Finally, Chapter 7 outlines the final reflections of the proposed thesis and provides directions for future research work.

CHAPTER 4. DUAL-CHANNEL SUPPLY CHAIN: A
STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT
(Elements of this chapter are taken from (Batarfi et al., 2016)) The aim of this chapter is to investigate the effect of adopting a dual-channel strategy on the performance of a two-level supply chain. This is investigated under centralized decision-making situations. The dual-channel strategy here is composed of a vendor and a retailer, and deals with two channels in which the retail channel offers a standard item and the online channel offers customized items. There could be other scenarios where a vendor offers standard items through a retailer and directly online or where a vendor offers a standard items through both channels as well as offering customization online. However, the existing literature on the dual-channel supply chain is mainly focused on optimizing the profit of a supply chain when both the vendor and the retailer offer a single item (standard) through the dual-channel (Yue and Liu, 2006; Chen et al., 2008; Hua et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012). Few studies have investigated the effect of selling standard and customized items in a dual-channel supply chain. We limit our investigation to a supply chain structure where a standard item is distributed through a retailer and customized items are sold through the online channel. The previous studies in this area, however, assumed no price discrimination of the customized items and did not consider the effect of the dual-channel on inventory decisions (Shao, 2013; Xiao et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015). We address this gap by investigating the optimal pricing decisions by finding the optimal markup margin, order and production quantities, and the number of shipments that will maximize the total profit of the system.

34 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 4.1 describes the developed models. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 present the assumptions and notations. Sections 4.4 introduces the mathematical models. Section 4.5 discusses numerical examples and the obtained results. Section 4.6 illustrates the effect of different input parameters through sensitivity analysis. Finally, the conclusion and the discussion are provided in Section 4.7.

4.1 Model Description
Consider a supply chain that consists of a vendor and a retailer. The vendor has a flexible production system in place that allows it to produce make-to-stock (MTS) and build-to-order (BTO) items. However, the vendor currently produces only one type of item based on the MTS process, which is then sold to customers through a traditional retail channel. This item is comprised of a core item (unfinished item) with some basic features added (henceforth a standard item). To meet customers' demand and their preferences, the vendor adopts a dual-channel strategy in which it opens an online channel in addition to the existing retail channel. Adopting a dual-channel strategy would allow the vendor to sell its standard items indirectly through the retail channel (as shown by the solid line in Figure 4.1 ) and to offer customized items, which follow a BTO process, directly to customers through an online channel (as demonstrated by the dotted line in Figure 4.1). A customer, for example, may therefore purchase a pre-configured (standard) item only from the retail channel or a customized item only from the vendor's online channel. The objective of this chapter is to investigate the effect of a dual-channel strategy on the performance of the supply chain system when inventory costs are considered. The total profit of the supply chain is the performance measure, which is maximized for the optimal markup margin, production/ordered quantity and the number of shipments.

Figure 4.1 Dual-channel supply chain The investigation starts first with a benchmark scenario, where the supply chain system is composed of a single channel (retail channel) and only one type of item is offered (the standard item). The single-channel strategy is similar to the one of Braglia and Zavanella (2003) who adopted a cost minimization approach. However, the developed model in this chapter deals with a profit maximization (Zanoni et al., 2014b; Zanoni and Jaber, 2015). Therefore, the revenue part will be implemented into their total cost equation. Moreover, Braglia and Zavanella (2003) assumed deterministic demand, whereas the demand function in this chapter is dependent on several parameters, including price. The second scenario in the chapter investigates the effect of adding an online channel to the existing traditional retail channel to form a dual-channel scenario.

36 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The optimal values of the decision variables of the dual-channel will be analyzed, and then compared with the benchmark scenario (the single channel strategy).

4.2 Assumptions
This chapter assumes the following: (1) The vendor has a production system in place to make standardized and customized items and does not need to invest in adopting a mass customization system. (2) Production rates for the standard and customized items are greater than the base demand, i.e. no shortages allowed. (3) The lead-time between the vendor and the retailer is zero (i.g., overnight deliveries (Maddah and Noueihed, 2017)). (4) The lead-time between the supplier (who supplies the additional custom features) and the vendor is zero. (5) A quoted delivery lead-time between the vendor and the customer is considered. It accounts for the waiting time from the point of ordering a customized item through the online channel to the point of delivering it to the consumer.

4.4 Mathematical models
4.4.1 Single-channel strategy
In this strategy, the vendor produces a MTS standard item only at a cost  , which is then sold to the retailer at the wholesale price  (after adding a markup percentage ), where  =  (1 + ). The retailer then adds the same markup percentage  to the wholesale price and sells the item to the consumers at the retail price  , where  >  >  and  =  (1 + )2. The central decisionÂ­maker seeks to maximize the total profit of the system by finding the optimal markup percentage , order quantity  , and the number of shipments  of the two firms. It is assumed that all orders of the standard item are filled by inventory and are replenished in a stock-driven environment. Motivated by the observation of the consignment stock (CS) policy (Battini et al., 2010; Valentini and Zavanella, 2003), the coordination mechanism between the vendor and the retailer is assumed to be under the CS policy. In the CS coordination mechanism, the vendor owns the inventory of the final item and stocks it at the retailer's warehouse, who sells the item to the end users from the consigned inventory and pays the vendor the wholesale price for only the withdrawn quantities that have been sold. Hence, the model in this chapter accounts for the production and inventory related costs of the standard item. As shown in Figure 4.2, the vendor produces a lot size   units of the standard item every  units of time, where  =   / . The lot is shipped to the retailer in equal batches of  units each every  / units of time. The vendor will continue the production and shipments of its inventory of the standard item until the retailer's inventory reaches the maximum limit (  - ( - 1)   /  ), which is determined by the number of shipments  and the ordered batch size

40 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

 . The retailer's inventory is depleted over the period  =   / . Before the retailer's inventory is completely exhausted, the vendor starts the production for the next cycle.

Figure 4.2: Behavior of the supply chain between the vendor and the retailer under the CS policy Similar to Tsay and Agrawal (2000) Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro (2005), Sajadieh and Jokar (2009), and Kim et al. (2011), a linear demand function is assumed, in which the demand of the retailer  decreases linearly with the retail price  and is written as follows:

 =  -  

(4.1)

Without loss of generality,  could be written as  () =  (1 + )2. Eq. (4.1) could then be rewritten as follows:

 =  -   (1 + )2

(4.2)

The next subsections, introduce the profit functions of the vendor and the retailer. The total profit of the supply chain is determined by the sum of both profits. All revenues and costs are based on per unit of time and are given as follows: 41 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

4.4.1.1 Vendor's profit The profit of the vendor in per unit of time is given as follows:

1, =  (1 + )  - (

  1   + +   )   2 

(4.3)

where the first term represents the vendor's revenue per unit of time. The second term represents the vendor's total cost per unit of time, which has been given by Braglia and Zavanella (2003). This cost includes the setup cost, the holding cost and the production cost. 4.4.1.2 Retailer's profit The profit of the retailer in per unit of time is given as follows:

2, =  (1 + )2  - (

  2   +  (1 + ) + (  - ( - 1) ))  2  

(4.4)

where the first term represents the retailer's revenue per unit of time. The second term represents the retailer's total cost per unit of time, which is given by Braglia and Zavanella (2003). This cost includes the ordering cost, the purchasing cost and the retailer's inventory holding cost. The supply chain's total profit is the sum of Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) and could be written as follows:

 = 1, + 2,

(4.5)

4.4.1.3 Optimal decisions of the single-channel strategy In the single-channel strategy when the vendor sells only the standard item through the retail channel, the total profit of the system  is a concave function in ,  and  . The proof of

42 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

concavity is shown in Appendix A.1. The optimal (indicated by an asterisk) solutions are given as follows:

( +   )  (1 + 2 -  2 ) 1   = -1 +  + + + 2 2   2    4   

(4.6)

(4.7)

  =

(4.8)

  One can notice that the optimal solutions  ,  , and  are not independent of each other.

Therefore, finding these optimal values require the use of a numerical procedure with nested iterations that can be easily implemented using a well-known mathematical software such as MATLAB, Maple, or Mathematica. In this chapter, an algorithm is developed in Microsoft Excel using the Solver Tool add-in, and enhanced with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Macros. The algorithm is developed to find the optimal solutions for these decision variables, in which the total profit of the system is maximized. The initial procedure for solving this problem is obtained by setting  = 1, and  = 1 and then finding the optimal values of  that maximize the total profit of the system  . Following that the solutions are determined for  =  + 1 where the total system's profit  is compared against previous iterations and then repeated until the maximum system profit is found for the first iteration. This iteration is repeated for  > 1 and until the maximum system profit for all iteration sets is found. A similar algorithm has been

43 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

proposed in Jaber and Goyal (2008, p. 4), Zanoni and Jaber (2015, p. 6) and Bazan et al. (2015, p. 9).

4.4.2 Dual-channel strategy
This section modifies the single-channel strategy by introducing an online channel as part of a dualchannel selling strategy. The objective of the central decision-maker (i.e. the vendor) is to maximize the total profit of the supply chain when the dual-channel strategy is adopted. The vendor in this scenario produces two items: a standard item, sold through the retail channel and a customized item, sold through the online-channel. The standard item is produced using the MTS process and follows the same inventory policy as in Section 4.4.1. To supply customized items, it is assumed that the vendor offers online a set of custom features that can be added to the core item. Hence, the customized items are BTO, in which each order of a customized item is prepared once a customer's order arrives to the vendor through the online channel. In practice there is no backlogging (zero inventory) for BTO or finished customized items (Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2009). Dell, for example, has developed a close relationship with its suppliers, which has allowed the company to operate with almost "no-work-in process inventory". The company pulls component from the supplier just as needed for producing the customized items (Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2009). Hence it is assumed that there is no inventory for the finished customized items. However, this model assumes that the vendor carries inventory of the core item that will be used in the customization process. The additional custom features that can be added to the core item are outsourced and are then supplied to the vendor once needed with zero lead-time. For example, when a customer orders a customized item through the online channel, the vendor takes one core item from the inventory and customizes it by adding as many features as requested by the customer. Once the customization is complete, the vendor delivers the item to the customer. The 44 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

vendor's inventory of the core item behaves like the Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) model as shown Figure 4.3. In the EPQ model, the vendor produces  units of the core item for customization at a rate  in  units of time, where  =  / and  is the demand of the online channel.

Figure 4.3: Behavior of the vendor's online-channel inventory under the EPQ model The different combinations of features added to the core customizable item are denoted as a set of variants  , where each variant  (   and  = 1,2, ... , ) is made up of one core item and at least one additional custom feature  , where  = 1, 2, ... ,  . For example, assuming that there are no dependencies between the additional features, if the vendor is offering feature X and Y, then the customer may request one feature (X or Y) or both (X and Y) to be added to the core item. Each additional  feature is priced independently; hence, the price of each variant  is different. Therefore, the production cost and the selling price of the customized items are not fixed (it depends on the number of features added to the core item). Let  be the production cost of a unit of variant , which includes the cost of the core item, the cost of the additional added feature(s) and a fixed processing cost for each customized item ordered through the online channel. The 45 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

vendor sells each customized item at a price  , where    and  = 1, 2, ... , . To avoid triviality problems, it is assumed that the selling price of each customized item  is always higher than the wholesale price of the standard item  (i. e.  >  ). This is not an arbitrary condition, because if the wholesale price is higher than the selling price of the customized item (i. e.  <  ), the retailer or any other arbitrator can obtain the item from the vendor's direct channel at a lower price (Hua et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012, 2013). Customers are heterogeneous in their preference of the standard or the customized items. Therefore, the number of customers choosing between the standard and customized items is affected by many factors. Following Hua et al. (2010), Huang et al. (2012, 2013), Yue and Liu (Yue and Liu, 2006), Zhang et al. (2015) and Raju and Roy (Raju and Roy, 2000), it is assumed that the demand functions for the standard and the customized items are linear. Specifically, the demand functions of the retail channel and the online channel are as follows:



 = (1 - ) -   +    +   - r 
=1

(4.9)



 =  -    +   -   + d

(4.10)

where  =  =1(   ) In Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10),  is the retailer's demand of the standard item and  is the vendor's direct channel demand of the customized item. The parameter  (  > 0) is the primary demand (potential demand when the two items are free of charge). The parameter  (0 <  < 1) and the 46 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

term (1 - ) represent the percentage of the demand going to the direct channel and the retail channel, respectively, when  and  are zero. In the literature,  has been referred to as customer's acceptance (preference) of the online channel when the items are free of charge (Hua et al., 2010).  and  are the price elasticity coefficients of  and  , respectively, representing the amount of decrease/increase in market demand when both channels increase/decrease the price by one dollar. It is assumed that , which represents the cross-price sensitivities, is symmetric. The cross-price sensitivities reflect the degree to which the items sold through the two channels are substitutable. It is assumed that  >  and  > , meaning that the self-price effects are greater than the cross-price effects, a common expression used in economic and operation management literature (Huang et al., 2012) The quoted delivery lead-time is incorporated into the model, since it significantly affects the customer's decision when buying the customized items online (Shao, 2013). Denote  as the quoted delivery lead-time, which is defined as the waiting time from the time an order is placed to the time it is delivered to the customer (Webster, 2002).  and  represent the elasticity of customer demand function,  , to changes in  of the retail and online channel, respectively, where  decreases as  becomes longer. For example, if  for a customized items increases by one unit,  units of demand will be lost, of which  units of that will be transferred to the retail channel and  -  ( <  ) units will be lost to both channels (Hua et al., 2010). Another important factor that affects customer decisions of buying a customized item from the online channel (versus a standard one from the retail channel) is the customized product differentiation, a marketing strategy that is used to distinguish one item from the other (Feitzinger and Lee, 1997).  is denoted as the customized product differentiation. It is assumed that  is a

47 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

function of  (denoted as the availability of the added custom features) and  (denoted as and the weight of importance of the added feature). The weight of importance is a measure of the preference of a customer for one feature compared to another. In practice, the weight of importance can be measured using a Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) method, such as the Analytic Hierarch Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (1980) or its extended model, fuzzy AHP developed by Van Laarhoven and Pedrycz (1983). The parameters r and d represent the product differentiation's elasticity of the demand in the retail channel and online channel, respectively, which means that if the product differentiation increases by one unit, d units of the demand will increase in the online channel of which r of the demand would be lost in the retail channel (r < d ). A company would usually generate the same return per dollar invested irrespective of the item sold; therefore, the selling price of the standard item  and the selling price of the customized item  , could be written as  () =  (1 + )2 and  () =  (1 + ), respectively. Considering a fixed markup margin for both standard and custom items, Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10) could be rewritten as follows:



 = (1 - ) -   (1 + ) +    (1 + ) +   - r 
=1

4.4.2.1 Vendor's profit The profit of the vendor per unit of time from selling the standard item to the retailer, 1, , is given by Eq. (4.3). The profit of the vendor in per unit of time from selling the finished customized items through the online channel is given by:

1,

  1   =   (1 + )   - ( +( ) (1 - ) +     )  2

(4.13)

where the first and second terms are, respectively, the vendor's revenue and total cost in per unit of time. The second term includes the vendor's setup cost of the core item  , the vendor's holding cost 1 and the vendor's production cost  . The parameter  , represents the percentage of the core item's stock that is used to customize item . 4.4.2.2 Retailer's profit The profit of the retailer per unit of time from selling the standard item to customers, 2, , is given by Eq. (4.4). The dual-channel supply chain's total profit is, , , is given by:

, = 1, + 1, + 2,

(4.14)

49 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

4.4.2.3 Optimal decisions of the dual-channel strategy The total profit of the dual-channel supply chain system, , , is a concave function in ,  ,  and  . The proof of concavity and finding the optimal solutions are given in Appendix A.2. The optimal (indicated by an asterisk) solutions are given as follows:

  =

    = 1  2 (1 -  )

   One can notice that the optimal solution occurs for  ,  , and  , which are not independent of

one another. Moreover, a closed-form expression for , is complex to find. Therefore, finding these optimal values requires the use of a numerical procedure with nested iterations that can be easily implemented using mathematical software. Therefore, an algorithm procedure in Microsoft Excel using the Solver Tool add-in enhanced with VBA codes was developed. The developed algorithm was used to find the values of the decision variables that produce optimal solutions, where the total profit is the performance measure to be maximized. A similar algorithm has been proposed in Jaber and Goyal (2008, p. 4), Zanoni and Jaber (2015, p. 6) and Bazan et al. (2015, p. 9).

50 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

4.5 Numerical examples
This section presents numerical examples to illustrate the behavior of the developed models. The purpose is to analyze the vendor's decisions about the dual-channel strategy and whether adopting an online channel to sell customized items is worthwhile. The numerical analysis is applied first on the single-channel strategy, and then on the dual-channel strategy. For simplicity, in the dualchannel strategy it was assumed that the vendor offers two customizable features to customers. Three different combinations of these features can be added to the core item. Table 4.1 lists the system input parameters that were used in the numerical example. The values of the input parameters in Table 4.1, were logically chosen based on the assumptions presented in Section 4.2 and from different published studies to make the model more meaningful (Waters, 2003; Hua et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2013; Shao, 2013). For example, the vendor's holding cost was set 20% of the unit production cost and retailer's holding cost was set at 30% of the unit production cost. Moreover, some other conditions were applied such as that the base demand is less than the production rates, to insure a no shortage condition. The numerical example is solved for both the single-channel and dual-channel strategies using similar steps to the referenced algorithms in Section 4.4.1.3. Table 4.2 describes how the search for the optimal solution using the algorithms was performed.

52 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The results of both the single-channel and the dual-channel strategies are summarized in Table 4.3. The results of the single-channel strategy showed that the profits of the vendor and the retailer are $647,734.52 and $1,123,724.92, respectively (column 2 and 3 of Table 4.3), corresponding to a total profit of $1,771,459.44. For the dual-channel strategy, the results show that the profits of the vendor and the retailer are $762,571.08 and $1,115,635.63, respectively (columns 4 and 5 of Table 4.3), corresponding to a total profit of $1,878,206.71. The results show that the profit of the retailer dropped in the dual-channel as compared to the single-channel strategy. This could be due to the effect of competition between the retail and the online channels. This finding corroborates to those of Shao (2013) and Li et al. (2015). The results also show that the ordered quantity of the standard item decreased from 335 for the single-channel to 325 units for the dual-channel with the number of shipments for both channels being the same. This decrease is a result of a decrease in demand. The findings also show that having a dual-channel strategy increases the markup margin from 0.73% (when only the standard item is sold) to 0.76 % (when the standard and the customized items are sold). For example, the retailer's selling price of the standard item,  , was found to increase from $451.12 to $465.44, when a dual-channel strategy is adopted. To improve the profit of the system without a loss in the retailer's profit, the retailer must be motivated to improve its retail service (e.g. provide partnered marketing, exclusive pricing/incentives, and rebranding). The framework developed by Yan and Pei (2009) provides some evidence of how improving the retail service can effectively improve the supply chain performance and the overall profit. Moreover, offering permissible delay in payments between the vendor and the retailer could help in maximizing the profits of the two players. For instance, Aljazzar et al. (2015) showed that incorporating permissible delay in payment in different production policies has reduced the total cost (and increased the profit) of a two-level supply chain. 53 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

4.6 Sensitivity analysis
This section expands on the presented numerical example by examining the effect of different input parameters on the behavior of the developed supply chain models to attain some qualitative insights. Table 4.4 summarizes the effect of the selected input parameters on the developed model. Each sensitivity analysis is tested on the optimal decisions and is discussed in the following subsections. Managerial insights are also provided after each sensitivity analysis.

4.6.1 Effect of varying production rates of the standard and the core customizable items
The production rate is an important factor that affects the behavior of a supply chain system. This subsection examines the effect of varying the value of the production rate on the supply chain for the single-channel and dual-channel strategies. 4.6.1.1 Single-channel The results showed that when the production rate of the standard item,   , increases from 6,500 to 22,500 units/year, the total profit of the single-channel strategy,  , decreases and the markup margin, , slightly increases (from 0.728 to 0.734, as seen in Figure 4.4). It was also observed that the ordered quantity,  , increases and the number of shipments,  , decreases with the increasing  (Figure 4.5). The significant increase in  is due to a sudden decrease in  , which indicates a change in the inventory policy (which is the number of shipments and the shipment size). To get a clearer picture, one can plot the lot size (   ) against the production rate, which will show a decreasing function. Meaning that as the production rate increases, the lot size

55 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

decreases. This variation in  and  has to do with the adjustments of the cost function to the minimum cost.

56 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

4.6.1.2 Dual-channel The results showed that as the production rate of the standard item,   , increases, the profit of the dual-channel strategy, , , decreases and the markup margin, , increases (Figure 4.6). Moreover, the ordered quantity,  , increases and the number of shipments,  , decreases as   increases (Figure 4.7). Similarly, the significant increase in  is due to the sudden decrease in  , which indicates a change in the inventory policy (which is the number of shipments and the shipment size). Which indicate that the as production rate increases, the lot size decreases. This variation in  and  has to do with the adjustments of the cost function to the minimum cost. Figure 4.7 also shows that the production quantity of the core item,  , is insensitive to the changes in  . We also examined the effect of varying the production rate of the core customizable item,  , on the developed model. The results showed that as  increases, the profit of the dual-channel strategy, , , decreases and the markup margin, , increases (Figure 4.8). On the other side, the production quantity of the core item,  , decreases with increasing,  , (Figure 4.9). It was also noted that varying  has no effect on the ordered quantity,  , and the number of shipments,  (Figure 4.9).

4.6.1.3 Managerial insights The results suggest that it is not beneficial for the vendor to produce at a fast production rate for both strategies as items will remain in stock for longer periods, thus increasing holding costs and decreasing profits. It is recommended that the vendor produces at a rate that is close to the demand rate. Moreover, it was found that the dual-channel strategy is more profitable, even when production rate is fast. For example, the loss of profit between producing at 6500 (units/year) and producing at 22,500 (units/year) of standard items in the dual-channel strategy is  $ 4,725 (0.25%) as compared to the single-channel strategy  $ 6526 (0.37 %).

4.6.2 Effect of varying the holding cost of the vendor and the retailer
The inventory holding cost plays a major part in affecting the supply chain behavior. For instance, a low/high inventory cost may influence the vendor to produce large/small quantities of its items. In this analysis, the effect of the holding cost ratio (vendor to the retailer holding cost) on the supply chain system is examined. 4.6.2.1 Single-channel As demonstrated in Figure 4.10 for the single-channel strategy, as the inventory unit holding of the retailer, 2 , decreases (while that of the vendor 1 unchanged), the total profit of the singlechannel strategy,  , increases and the markup margin, , decreases. On the other hand, the ordered quantity,  , and the number of shipments,  , increase with increasing the ratio of 1 /2 (Figure 4.11). A significant drop in  occurs due to the increase in  , which indicates a change in the inventory policy. For example, plotting the lot size (   ) against (1 /2 ) shows an increasing function. This means that as the ratio (1 /2 ) increases, the lot size increases.

4.6.2.2 Dual-channel The same sensitivity analysis (1 /2 ) is investigated when adopting the dual-channel strategy. The results are demonstrated in Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13. In Figure 4.12, an increase in 1 /2 results in an increase in the profit of the dual-channel strategy, , , with no change in the value of the markup margin, . However, the ordered quantity,  , and the number of shipments,  , increases with the increase of 1 /2 . Similarly, the significant drop in  occurs due to the increase in  , which indicates a change in the inventory policy which means that as the ratio (1 /2 ) increases, the lot size increases. The production quantity,  , is not affected by the change in the ratio of the holding cost (Figure 4.13).

62 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

Figure 4.13 Effect of 1 /2 on  ,  and  (Dual-channel) 4.6.2.3 Managerial insights The results suggest that it is beneficial for the supply chain system to have a low inventory unit holding cost at the side of the retailer, which is in line with the literature (Zanoni et al., 2014a; Mandal and Giri, 2015; Zahran et al., 2015), as it helps the vendor in saving on its holding costs by making more frequent and larger shipments to the retailer. It helps to free space at the vendor for other items. The results also suggested that it is more profitable for the vendor to adopt a dualchannel strategy, as it increases sales while maintaining the same markup margin and lower holding costs.

4.6.3 Effect of varying the vendor's setup cost and the retailer's ordering cost
Similar to examining the effect of the inventory holding cost on the developed model, the ratio of the vendor's setup cost over the retailer's ordering cost ( / ) is investigated. To do this, the retailer's ordering cost has been varied while the vendor's setup cost has been fixed. The results 63 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

are demonstrated in Figure 4.14 and Figure 4.15 for the single-channel and Figure 4.16 and Figure 4.17 for the dual-channel. 4.6.3.1 Single-channel As shown in Figure 4.14, the total profit of single-channel strategy,  , decreases and the markup margin, , slightly increases when the ratio  / increases. Figure 4.15 shows that increasing  / increases the ordered quantity,  , and decreases the number of shipments,  . The significant increase in  is due to the sudden decrease in  , which indicates a change in the inventory policy (which is the number of shipments and the shipment size). To get a clearer picture, one can plot the lot size (   ) against the production rate, which will show a decreasing function. Meaning that as the ratio  / increases, the lot size decreases. This variation in  and  has to do with the adjustments of the cost function to the minimum cost.

Figure 4.15 Effect of  / on  and  (Single-channel) 4.6.3.2 Dual-channel The ratio of the vendor's setup cost over the retailer's ordering cost ( / ) has a similar effect on the total profit of the dual-channel strategy, , , and the markup margin, , when the dualchannel strategy is implemented; the total system's profit, , , decreases with a slight increase in the markup margin, , when increasing the ratio from 0.1 to 1, (Figure 4.16). The results show that increasing  / , increases  and decreases  , with no effect on the production quantity,  (Figure 4.17). Similarly, the significant drop in  occurs due to the decrease in  , meaning that as the ratio ( / ) increases, the lot size decreases.

4.6.3.3 Managerial insights The results suggest that a lower ordering cost reduces the total cost of the supply chain as frequent and larger batches of the standard item are made by the retailer whose holding cost is also lower than that of the vendor. As both strategies behave in a similar manner for the variance in the ordering cost, it can be noted that as the ordering cost is lower, the movement of items (from the vendor to the retailer) in the supply chain increases, and reduces significantly when the ordering cost increases. It is suggested that the supply chain and in particular the retailer apply new methods or implement new technologies that help reduce its order cost.

4.6.4 Effect of varying customers' acceptance of the online channel
Customers' acceptance of buying online is increasing (Li et al., 2015). The effect of varying customers' acceptance, , on the behavior of the centralized dual-channel supply chain is shown in Figure 4.18. The results show that the total profit of the dual-channel strategy, , , increases with an increasing  (from 0.3 to 0.65), but slightly decreases the markup margin, , (from 0.76 to 0.73). This suggests that increasing customer loyalty does not necessarily mean that a firm has to sacrifice its profit margin. The results in Figure 4.19 show that as  increases (from 0.3 to 0.65),  and  decrease. The sudden decrease in  occurs due to a sudden decrease in  , meaning that as the  increases, the lot size ( .  ) decreases. Additionally, it was found that  increases with an increasing value of . 4.6.4.1 Managerial insights The results suggest that as customers' acceptance of buying online increases the total profit of the dual-channel supply chain increases. Given current market trends toward higher acceptance of the online channel, vendors need to strongly consider adopting dual-channel strategies. Therefore, the vendor should also consider what type of items to be sold through the online channel and whether 67 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

or not its customers will be willing to purchase it, this is in line with the recommendations of some studies (Hua et al., 2010). For example, items that require inspection before committing to purchasing them, or require after-sale service, are less amenable to be sold through the direct channel, than items that require less inspection and services.

4.6.5 Effect of varying the quoted delivery lead-time
The quoted delivery lead-time,  , of the customized items to customers is an important factor that affects the demand of the online channel. The results in Figure 4.20 show that the dual-channel strategy would be more profitable than the single-channel strategy if  of customized items is relatively short. Moreover, even with a longer  , the dual-channel strategy is much preferred to the single-channel strategy. This insight is consistent with the conclusion of Shao (2013). The effect of  on  ,  and  is shown in Figure 4.21. It was found that, as  becomes longer,  slightly increases with  remains unchanged. The production quantity,  , on the other hand, decreases significantly for longer  . 4.6.5.1 Managerial insights When a vendor is faced with long quoted delivery lead-times, it is recommended that it considers hiring a reliable third party logistics (3PL) firm to handle the delivery of customized items to 69 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

customers quickly. If it is expensive to hire a 3PL, the vendor should consider shortening the quoted delivery-time through learning-based continuous improvement efforts (Jaber, 2016). However, such efforts incur costs such as training workers, shortening the time to processing and customize orders, and using economical and effective modes of delivery (i.e. consolidated shipments, zone skipping).

4.6.6 Effect of varying sensitivity to product differentiation
Product differentiation,  affects the profitability of a dual-channel supply chain, , ,as shown in Figure 4.22 and Figure 4.23. Figure 4.22 shows that an increase in  will lead to an increase in , and the markup margin . In contrast, Figure 4.23 shows that as  increases, the lot size,    , of the standard item follows a decreasing trend, despite its sudden jump. This decrease is due to a decrease in the demand of the standard item. Comparatively, the production quantity  steadily increases with increasing  (Figure 4.23). 4.6.6.1 Managerial insights One key insight from the above analysis is that increasing the elasticity of product differentiation could increase the system's profit. This may indicate that offering more customized items satisfy a wider range of customer requirements, thus increasing demand and subsequently sales and profits. However, an indiscriminate increase in product customization through offering a large list 71 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

of custom features could incur extra costs. One suggestion to be made here is that the vendor should involve customers at an early stage in the design process of new customized items. This could determine the desired level of product customization and therefore, have a better projection of the increase in sales (Blecker and Friedrich, 2006)

4.7 Summary and Conclusions
This chapter aimed at investigating the dual-channel strategy's effect on the behavior of a twolevel supply chain (vendor-retailer) model, where a standard item is sold through a retail channel and customized products are sold online by the vendor. Specifically, this chapter explored how the total profit, the markup margin, and the inventory decisions of this supply chain are affected by the adoption of an online customizable-item channel. Two strategies were considered. The first strategy (a benchmark scenario) analyzed the behavior of the system when the supply chain is composed of a single channel (retail channel) in which the standard item is offered based on the MTS process. Since this chapter introduces a new channel to a two-level supply chain, where the vendor needs to account for inventory space for the new channel and where demand of the retail channel will be affected by the introduction of the online channel, the consignment stock policy was used as a coordination mechanism between the vendor and the retailer. In this scenario, the

73 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

profit was maximized by finding the optimal markup margin, ordered quantity and number of shipments of the standard item. The second strategy analyzed the effect of the dual-channel (where the vendor offers standard items through the retail channel and customized items through the online channel) on the behavior of supply chain. The consignment stock policy was again used between the vendor and the retailer for the standard items. However, the production-inventory behavior of the core item followed the economic production quantity model. No inventory was assumed for finished customized items. In this scenario, the objective was to find the optimal profit of the dual-channel system by finding the optimal markup margin of the two items, the order quantity and number of shipments of the standard item, and the production quantity of the core item. A numerical example was performed on both strategies and the results were compared. The results showed that the dual-channel strategy outperforms the single-channel strategy, and that the vendor is the one who benefits from the strategy by having a higher markup margin and profit. On the other hand, the retailer's profit was shown to decrease in the dual-channel strategy due to a decrease in the ordered quantity of the standard item per shipment. In general, the increase in the total profit of the system is typically due to two reasons. Firstly, adopting the dual-channel strategy reduces the double marginalization problem in the retail channel. Secondly, adopting the dualchannel strategy increases the market coverage. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to examine the effect of varying some of the input parameters, first when the single-channel strategy is used, and then when the dual-channel is adopted. The results showed that changing some of the input parameters have a major impact on the optimal decisions of the supply chain system. For example, when varying the ratio of the holding cost (vendor to retailer), the total profit of the system in both strategies increased; 74 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

indicating that a lower holding cost at the retailer's side benefits the supply chain system. The results also showed that customer acceptance of the online-channel, the quoted delivery lead-time, and elasticity of product differentiation (,  and  , respectively), have a great impact on the total profit of the dual-channel strategy. Since the adoption of the online channel can benefit the vendor by increasing its total profit, while cannibalizing the retailer's profit, improving the retail service as suggested by Yan, Z. Pei (Yan and Pei, 2009) can play a major part in improving the performance of the supply chain and the total profit of the system. The success of the retail channel has a direct impact on the customer perception and decision to adopt the online channel.

CHAPTER 5. A PROFIT MAXIMIZATION FOR A REVERSE LOGISTICS DUAL-CHANNEL SUPPLY CHAIN
WITH A RETURN POLICY
(Elements of this chapter are taken from (Batarfi et al., 2017)) This chapter studies a supply chain system that comprises of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) manages the forward logistics (FL) part of the supply chain; whereas, the reverse logistics (RL) part of the supply chain is outsourced to a third-party logistics (3PL) provider for the refurbishment of returned repairable items. The objective is to examine the effect of adopting different return policies when a dualchannel strategy is adopted on the behavior of the supply chain system while considering inventory, refurbishing, outsourcing, and disposal costs. The chapter analyzes first the behavior of the system when the supply chain system is composed of a single-channel strategy in which the retail channel offers both standard and refurbished standard items. Then, the chapter analyzes the behavior of the system when a dual-channel strategy is adopted, where the retail channel offers standard items whereas the online channel offers customized and refurbished items (refurbished standard and refurbished customized). In both strategies, the primary objective is to investigate the optimal prices and the optimal inventory decisions under different return policies (i.e., full, partial, or no refund) that maximize the total profit of the system. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.1 describes the developed models. Section 5.2 and 5.3 introduces the assumption and notations used in developing the proposed models. Sections 5.4 presents the mathematical models. Section 5.5 discusses numerical examples

76 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

and the obtained results. Section 5.6 discusses sensitivity analysis of different input parameters. Section 5.7 presents the conclusion remarks and outlines future extensions.

5.1 Model Description
Consider a closed-loop supply chain system that consists of an OEM (henceforth vendor 1), a 3PL (henceforth vendor 2) and a retailer. It is assumed that the vendor 1 is capable of producing MTS (make-to-stock) and BTO (build-to-order) items. Presently, vendor 1 offers a standard item (a core item with basic features) based on the MTS process, sold to customers through the retail channel. To increase the market share and meet other customers' demand, vendor 1 adopts a dual-channel strategy in which it opens an online channel in addition to its existing retail channel. Doing this allows vendor 1 to offer MTS standard items indirectly through the retail channel and BTO customized items directly through the online channel. Moreover, to achieve a market competitive advantage, vendor 1 offers a return policy agreement in which unsatisfied customers with their purchased item may return the item for a refund. If the returned item is repairable, it will be then refurbished and offered to customers at a lower price than the original price of a newly produced item. Returned non-repairable items are disposed of. To reduce logistics and inventory costs, the returned repairable items are refurbished through a contracted 3PL provider (vendor 2) (Cheng and Lee, 2010). The role of the 3PL in this chapter is restricted to refurbishing returned repairable items and does not include transportation. However, as it has been noted in the introduction (Section 1.5), a 3PL can perform both activities; these activities could be addressed in a future work. According to the contract agreement, vendor 1 pays vendor 2 a fee for each refurbished unit. Since vendor 2 is only responsible for the refurbishing processes, the ownership of the refurbished items belongs to vendor 1. Additionally, it is assumed

77 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

that a customer unsatisfied with the purchase of a refurbished item can return the item for a refund. Returned refurbished items are repaired and then offered to customers as refurbished items.

5.2 Assumptions
This chapter assumes the following (1) Refurbished items are not considered as-good-as-new. (2) Lead-time between vendor 1 and the retailer in the single-channel strategy is zero. (3) Lead-time between vendor 2 and the retailer in the single-channel strategy is zero. (4) Vendor 2 has a production system to refurbish the returned repairable items. (5) Collection rates for returned items are known and constant. (6) All input parameters are positive. (7) Infinite planning horizon. (8) All cost input parameters do not vary over time. (9) Shortages are not allowed.

5.4 Mathematical models
5.4.1 Single-channel strategy
In the single-channel strategy, the supply chain system is comprised of a production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. Figure 5.1 depicts the flow of the standard and refurbished items from the system to the market (forward) and the flow of the returned items from the market to the system (reverse). In Figure 5.1, there are three subsystems: vendor 1's system, vendor 2's system and the retailer's system. Vendor 1's system is responsible for the production of the standard items that are sold to the retailer at 1  . Vendor 2's system, on the other hand, is responsible for refurbishing the returned repairable items, which are then sold back to the retailer at 1  . The retailer's system offers both items, standard and refurbished, at  and  , respectively. With a return policy agreement provided by vendor 1, unsatisfied customers can return the standard or refurbished items to the retailer, and receive a refund of  or  , respectively. The refunded amounts  and  can be a full, a proportional or a zero (denied) refund of the selling price  and  , respectively, where  =   ,  =   and 0   ,   1. 81 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

Returned standard and refurbished standard items (  and   , respectively) received by the retailer are screened immediately, and only the repairable-returned ones (   and    ) are kept in the retailer's inventory and then are shipped in one batch to vendor 2's facility for refurbishing. Non-repairable items (   and    ) are disposed at  per unit that is charged to vendor 1.

The behavior of the inventory for vendor 1 and the retailer for the standard items is based on the consignment stock (CS) policy agreement and is illustrated in Figure 5.2.

A lot of size   units of the standard items is shipped to the retailer in equal batches of  units each every  /  and until the retailer's inventory reaches a maximum limit of (  - ( - 1)   / ), which is determined by the number of shipments  and the ordered batch size  (Zahran et al., 2015). During the retailer's inventory depletion period, vendor 1 does not produce. Just before the retailer's inventory is completely exhausted, vendor 1 starts the production for the next cycle.

The processed refurbished items are shipped to the retailer's warehouse in equal batches of size  each at time intervals  , ( =  / ). Figure 5.3 shows the behavior of the inventory of the refurbished items between vendor 2 and the retailer.

83 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

To refurbish   , vendor 2 receives from the retailer     of returned repairable standard items and     of returned repairable refurbished standard items (e. g.   =     +     ) as shown in Figure 5.4. From this, we have   =     +     . Hence,  =

.

There could be other scenarios where the time interval of receiving the returned repairable refurbished standard items is shorter (longer) than that for receiving the returned repairable standard items. However, this does not affect the behavior of the model. Therefore, we choose a classical scenario as considering all scenarios will proportionally expand the chapter.

Figure 5.4: Inventory behavior of the returned repairable items at the retailer's side 5.4.1.1 Demand functions In the single-channel strategy, there are two demand functions that are satisfied through the retail channel, which are the demand for the standard item,  , and the demand for the refurbished item,  . It is assumed that customers are sensitive to the price of the standard item,  , and the price of refurbished standard items,  , in which a higher price has a negative effect on the demand  and  . This sensitivity is moderated by the coefficients  and  that represent the elasticity of the two demand functions to  and  , respectively. Additionally, it is assumed that customers are sensitive to the return policy offered by vendor 1, in which a generous (tightened) return policy for the standard and refurbished items,  =   and  =   with 0   ,   1, increases (decreases) the demand,  and  . This sensitivity is moderated by the coefficients  and  that represent the elasticity of the two demand functions with respect to the return policy  and  . Since the two items (standard and refurbished) are in direct competition, there will be a migration factor of demand from one to the other depending on the relative price of the two items. Hence, the parameter  is a migration parameter, which represents the amount of demand lost by the 85 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

standard item to the refurbished item. Note that  -  is the price difference between the two items; this price difference is moderated by a loss of a value  for the refurbished item (Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra, 2006). Like many in the literature, this chapter assumes a linear demand function (Tsay and Agrawal, 2000; Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra, 2006; Li et al., 2013). Specifically, the demand functions for the standard and the refurbished items are similar in form to the demand functions proposed by Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2006) and are of the following forms:

 =  -   +    - ( -  - )

(5.1)

 =  -   +    + ( -  - )

(5.2)

where  and  represent the primary demand for the newly produced standard and the refurbished standard items, respectively. The primary demand depends on general economic factors (i.e., brand image, product quality) that are outside the scope of this thesis. 5.4.1.2 Vendor 1's profit function The total profit of vendor 1 in per unit of time is given as:

 1 1 1 1  1 =  1 - (1 +  + 2  +  +  + 1 +  + )

The optimal solutions of Eqs. (5.23)-(5.27) are not independent of each other. Therefore, the problem is solved using a solution procedure that is modeled in Microsoft Excel using the Solver Tool add-in and enhanced with Visual Basic Macro. This solution procedure is similar to the one found in Jaber and Goyal (2008). The initial procedure for solving this problem is obtained by setting  = 1,  = 1 and  = 1 and then finding the optimal values of  and  that maximize  . Following that the solutions are determined for  =  + 1 and  =  + 1 where  is compared against previous iterations and then repeated until the maximum  is found for the first iteration. This iteration is repeated for  > 1 and until the maximum system's profit is found.

5.4.2 Dual-channel strategy
In this section, the single-channel strategy is modified by adding an online channel to form a dualchannel selling strategy. The objective is to reinvestigate managerial insight related to selling prices and inventory decisions when the dual-channel strategy is adopted. The modified forward and reverse flow of the material in the dual-channel strategy is demonstrated in Figure 5.5.

Figure 5.5 Forward and reverse material flow system for the dual-channel strategy In the dual-channel strategy, vendor 1 produces two items: MTS standard items sold to costumers through the retail channel, and BTO customized items sold to customers directly through the online channel. The standard items follow the same inventory policy (CS policy) described in Section 5.4.1 (see Figure 5.2). The retailer receives the returned standard items and then ships them in a single batch to the facility of vendor 2. The latter then refurbishes these items and offers them to customers directly through the online channel of vendor 1. In practice, the handling of both refurbishing and the distribution of returned items by a 3PL provider has shown to reduce transportation and other costs related to

Therefore, it is assumed that vendor 2 in this strategy offers the refurbished standard items through vendor 1's online channel rather than through the retail channel. It is assumed that the refurbished standard items, offered through the online channel, has a similar return policy as the one applied to a newly produced standard item. A customer unsatisfied with the online purchase of a refurbished standard item, can send the item directly to vendor 2's facility through special instructions provided by vendor 1 (e.g. printing a return label addressed to vendor 2's facility and paid by vendor 1) (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2005; Aulkemeier et al., 2015). The inventory for the refurbished standard items at vendor 2's facility behaves similarly to the economic production quantity (EPQ) model (see Figure 5.6), in which vendor 2 refurbishes  unit at a production rate  at time  , where  =  / and the finished refurbished standard items consumed at a certain rate.

Figure 5.6 Inventory behavior at vendor's 2 side for the refurbished standard items For the customized items, it is assumed that each customized item is built or prepared once the customer's order is received through the online channel. To do this, it is assumed that vendor 1 offers a set of custom features online that can be added to the core item. Due to the close relationship with suppliers, firms (e.g. Dell) that offer BTO customized items, usually carries zero inventory (no backlogging) of finished customized item (Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2009). However, 98 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

in this chapter, it is assumed that vendor 1 carries the inventory of the core item that will be used in the eventual customization process. The additional custom features that can be added to the core item are outsourced and are supplied to vendor 1 once needed with zero lead-time; hence, we consider no inventory for the additional custom features. For the inventory of the core item at vendor 1's facility it is assumed that it behaves according to an EPQ model where the vendor produces  units of core items at time  , where  =  / . The core items are consumed during the processing run for the customization orders. The behavior of the inventory of the core items is shown in Figure 5.7

Figure 5.7 Inventory behavior at vendor's 1 side for the core customizable item  is defined as the set of variant features, for each variant  (   and  = 1,2, ... , ). A core item is customized by adding  (where  = 1, 2, ... , ) features of the set  , each at a price. The production cost for a customized item is  and its selling price is  , and both vary from item to item (it depends on the number of features added to the core product + the core item + a processing fee) (Batarfi et al., 2016). To avoid triviality problems, it is assumed that the selling price of each customized item is always higher than the selling price of the standard item to the retailer. This is not an arbitrary condition, because if the selling price of the standard item to the

99 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

retailer is higher than the selling price of the customized product to customers, then the retailer or any other arbitrator can obtain the customized item from vendor 1's direct channel at a lower price. It is assumed that customized items purchased through the online channel can also be returned for a refund of  . The customized items can be returned directly to vendor 2's facility in a similar manner to returning a refurbished standard item ordered online. Vendor 2 then refurbishes the customized items and reoffers them through vendor 1's online channel as a refurbished customized items at  which is agreed upon with vendor 1. The behavior of the inventory for the refurbished customized items at vendor 2's facility also behaves like an EPQ model (see Figure 5.8).

5.5 Numerical example
In this section, a simulation study using nested loop search coupled with the Microsoft Excel Solver tool written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) codes similar to the one provided in Jaber and Goyal (2008) is conducted to solve more than one thousand numerical examples for both strategies. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the system by setting  ,  and  as decision variables in the single channel strategy and setting  ,  , and  as decision variables in the dual-channel strategy. In these numerical examples, the values of the input parameters were

115 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

generated randomly from a uniform distribution each over its range of minimum and maximum values. The minimum and maximum values of some of the input parameters were determined from published studies such as Jaber et al. (2014) and Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2006). Other input parameters were logically estimated to meet the considered assumption and conditions in this chapter, such as the production rates are greater than the demand rates. Moreover, the percentage values of the financial and physical holding costs were based on the suggestions of Waters (2003). For example, the physical storage holding cost was set at 9% of the unit cost; on the other hand, the financial holding cost was set at 10% of the unit cost. Table 5.1 shows the ranges of the values of the input parameters and the values of a one randomly selected numerical example that was used for illustration purposes.

117 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The selected random example was solved for both the single-channel and the dual-channel strategies and the results are shown in Table 5.2 and Table 5.3, respectively. In Table 5.2, the first two columns show an analysis of the proportion of the selling price that is refunded to customers. In the interest of creating a return policy that is beneficial for vendor 1, it is assumed that when vendor 1 offers a full or a partial refund on the standard items, the refund on the refurbished items should be equal to or lesser than the refund on the standard items. For instance, in the single channel strategy, when vendor 1 offers a full refund (100%) for both standard and refurbished items ( =  = 1), the optimal selling prices for the standard and refurbished items were  =$763.71 and  =$566.07, respectively, and the optimal inventory decisions were  =148,  =2 and  =1 with an optimal profit of $2,015,989. In another scenario, when vendor 1 offers a 75% refund on the standard item, the refund on the refurbished item should be less than or equal 75%. Assuming ( =  = 0.75), the optimal selling prices were found to be  =$637.68 and  =$431.29 with optimal inventory decisions of  =164,  =2 and  =1, and a total profit of $1,587,885.03. Correspondingly, in Table 5.3 when offering a full refund in the dual-channel strategy the optimal decisions were as follows: the selling prices are  = $763.46,  = $564.93,  = $1,032.00, and  = $596.08, optimal inventory decisions are  = 105,  = 3 and  = 230 with a maximum profit of $4,859,322.90. From Table 5.2 and Table 5.3, it was observed that the selling prices increase as the refund proportion increases, indicating that, the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demands, the selling prices and the total profits. This is logical since, if vendor 1 offers a higher refund, it will face a risk of losing the value of the product where it will be considered as a returned item rather than a new one. Davis et al. (1995, p. 9) provided a rational explanation for higher

118 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

price-higher refund policy. They mentioned that a full refund policy (money-back guarantee) "may allow the retailer to charge higher prices because the reduction in the risk from the product's being a poor match with customers' tastes may increase consumers' willingness to pay." Additionally, the strategy of offering a lower refund and decreasing the prices could be used as a discount selling strategy. For example, if vendor 1 would like to offer a 50% discount on the standard product, then the vendor could use the no-refund policy. Many companies nowadays use "final sale" "no-return" policy on sale or clearance items; Sears, for example, offers a full refund policy to its customers on regular priced items, whereas, marked-down priced items are offered with no return policy (Chen and Bell, 2012). Comparing the results of the single-channel strategy in Table 5.2 with the dual-channel strategy in Table 5.3 it was found the dual-channel strategy outperformed the single channel strategy. Moreover, the results also revealed that the adoption of the dual-channel strategy has no significant effect on the prices of the standard and refurbished standard items. For example, under the full refund policy, the price of the standard and refurbished standard items item in the single-channel strategy were  = 763.71 and  = 566.07, respectively. Under the dual-channel strategy the two prices were  = 763.46 and  = 564.93, respectively.

5.6 Sensitivity analysis
This section expands on the selected numerical example presented above, by performing a number of sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of changing the value of different input parameters on the behavior of the developed supply chain models. When changing the value of one parameter, (in the selected numerical example) the values of the remaining parameters are kept fixed at their initial values. Each sensitivity analysis is tested on the optimal profit, and pricing decisions for both the single-channel and the dual-channel strategies and are discussed in detail in the following subsections, with graphical representations.

5.6.1 Effect of varying the coefficient of the price elasticity
The effect of varying the value of the coefficient of the price elasticity of the standard and the refurbished standard items ( and  , respectively) on the supply chain's behavior is examined in this subsection. The results as demonstrated in Figure 5.11 showed that as  increases (from 3 to 15), the total profit of the single-channel strategy ( ) decreases by about 85%, whereas the total profit of the dual-channel strategy ( ) decreases by about 46%. The price of the standard and the refurbished standard items ( and  , respectively) reduced significantly. Similarly, as  increases (from 10 to 20), the total profit  decreases by about 51%, the total profit  decreased by about 22%, and both prices  and  decrease (see Figure 5.12). 5.6.1.1 Managerial insight One can notice that as customers are more sensitive to the price of the standard item (i.e.,  increases), the decision maker (i.e., the vendor) needs to decrease  in order to stem the decline in demand and the overall profit of both the single channel,  , and the dual-channel,  . Moreover, the manufacturer needs to lower the price of the refurbished ( ) items to accommodate 122 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

the decrease in  . Therefore, the decision maker needs to ensure a lower  to achieve a beneficial and profitable supply chain and to increase the differences between the two prices  and  . One possible way of making customers less price-sensitive is by differentiating the standard item from the competition (i.e., improving the quality of the item) and thereby reducing customer's sensitivity to higher prices (Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra, 2006). A similar managerial guideline is also gained when  is varied (the decision maker needs to ensure a lower  ). This can be possibly done by providing the same warranty given on new items, on the refurbished ones. Another interesting managerial guideline that is gained from this analysis is that the dual-channel strategy is more profitable than the single channel strategy even with higher sensitivity to prices. Therefore, adopting a dual-channel strategy is the profitable decision to make.

5.6.2 Effect of varying the sensitivity of the demand with respect to the return policy
In this sensitivity analysis, when the sensitivity of the demand with respect to the return policy of the standard and the refurbished standard item ( ) increases (from 1 to 5) as shown in Figure 5.13, the total profit of the single-channel strategy ( ), increases by about 59%. However, the total profit of the dual-channel strategy ( ) increases by about 32%. Moreover, it was observed that the two prices of the standard and refurbished standard items ( and  , respectively) have significant increase as  increases. We also found that the difference between the two prices ( -  ) increase as  increases. Likewise, when  (the sensitivity of the demand with respect to the return of the refurbished item) increases, the total profit  increases by about 63%, the total profit  increases by about

124 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

47%, and the two prices  and  significantly increase (see Figure 5.14). Interestingly, it was found that the difference between the two prices ( -  ) decrease as  increases. 5.6.2.1 Managerial insight The results suggest that the higher the customer's sensitivity to the return policy is, the higher the demand, the prices and the overall profit. These positive results can be achieved by offering a generous return policy that is beneficial to the supply chain. Increasing customer's sensitivity to the return policy can be achieved by increasing the customers' awareness and benefits of the offered return policy (e.g. effective advertisement) at the retail channel and/or at the online channel, for both new and refurbished products (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2005; Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra, 2006). Moreover, the decision maker needs to be aware that when the elasticity of customers to the refurbished item increases in which the difference in prices becomes smaller, customers may prefer the newly standard item to the refurbished standard item.

5.6.3 Effect of varying migration parameter
The results of varying the migration parameter ( ), as demonstrated in Figure 5.15, showed that as  increases, the total profit single-channel ( ) decreases by about 36% and the price of the standard item ( ) decreases, whereas the price of the refurbished item ( ) increases. A similar analysis was performed for the dual-channel strategy and the results are shown in Figure 5.16. As  increases, the profit of the dual-channel ( ) decreases by about 47%. The price of the new standard and new customized items ( and  , respectively) decrease. However, the price of the refurbished standard and refurbished customized items ( and  , respectively), increase. 5.6.3.1 Managerial insight From the above sensitivity analysis, when applied to both strategies, it is clear that a lower  is beneficial for the supply chain. The decision maker can achieve a lower  through effective advertisements (for example, by showing the benefits of owning a brand-new item compared to a refurbished one). This result is consistent with the findings of Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra (2006). Furthermore, the marketing strategy could focus solely on advertising their new items rather than placing any focus at all on the refurbished items. For example, many companies such as Apple focus their advertisement on newly produced items rather than on refurbished items. With the rapid growth of secondary markets for refurbished products, companies may have to direct some of their commercial ads to those customers on budgets. Having a secondary market is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, it would indeed be an interesting idea to consider in another work.

5.6.4 Effect of varying the proportion of returned items
The changes in the optimal profit and pricing decisions of the two strategies with respect to varying the proportion of the returned items are examined here. In the single channel strategy, as the proportion of returned standard item ( ) increases (from 5% to 50%), the total profit of the singlechannel strategy  is reduced by about 36%, the price of the standard item ( ) increases, and the price of the refurbished standard item ( ) decreases, as shown in Figure 5.17. We also investigated the effect of varying the proportion of returned refurbished standard items ( ) on  ,  , and  and similar results were obtained. The effect of varying  when the dual-channel strategy is adopted was also investigated and the results are shown in Figure 5.18. The results showed that as  increases (from 5% to 50%), the total profit of the dual-channel strategy ( ) is reduced by 15%, the price  increases, and the price  decreases. Moreover, no effect was observed on the price of the customized and refurbished customized items ( and  , respectively). Similar results were found when  is varied when the dual-channel strategy is adopted. 5.6.4.1 Managerial insight From the above sensitivity analysis, it is clear that adopting the dual-channel strategy is more profitable, even when the proportion of the returned items is higher. One key insight that is gained from this sensitivity analysis is that as a lower  or  is always beneficial for the supply chain in both the single-channel and the dual-channel strategies. The decision maker of the supply chain can achieve a lower return rate by offering restrictions or a limited-time return policy to return the purchased item. This insight is consistent with what is being practiced by many firms nowadays. For example, Best Buy offers between 14-30 days return policy on some of its offered products 129 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

and depending on the type of the item, it should be returned in its original packaging and/or unopened ("Returns and exchanges policy - Best Buy Canada," 2016). Other companies also restrict returns by using the "no receipt, no return" policy. Reducing return rate can also be achieved by encouraging customer review. Customer review plays an important factor in providing visual information that gives customers confidence in purchasing the desired item (Pfister, 2014).

5.6.5 Effect of varying the proportion of returned repairable items
In this sensitivity, the proportion of the returned repairable items is varied to investigate its effect on the supply chain of both strategies. The results as shown in Figure 5.19, showed that as the proportion of the returned repairable standard items ( ) increases (from 10% to 90%), the singlechannel profit ( ) increases by about 0.7% only, and both the price of the standard and refurbished standard items ( and  , respectively), decrease minimally. Similar results were also obtained when the proportion of the returned repairable refurbished standard item ( ) is varied. Comparatively, when the dual-channel strategy is adopted, the results as demonstrated in Figure 5.20 showed that as  increases (from 10% to 90%), the dual-channel's profit ( ), increases by about 0.25% and both  and  decreases minimally. No change in the price of the

131 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

customized and refurbished customized items ( and  , respectively), was observed when  or  was varied. 5.6.5.1 Managerial insight From the above sensitivity analysis, it is clear that the manufacturer will be making some extra profit if the proportion of the return items is more repairable than unrepairable. This is because the returned items that are suited for repair provide the manufacturer with additional means of profit on a previously sold item even though the production cost is now higher. In contrast, if the returned items are unsuitable for repair, this presents a total loss to the manufacturer as the product is now sent for disposal. Therefore, the decision maker can seek to achieve a higher proportion of repairable items through the investment in quality improvement actions or through the implementation of an inspection and testing procedure into the production processes with the aim of reducing and/or recovering defective items (Hsieh and Liu, 2010).

5.7 Summary and Conclusions
This chapter considers a forward and a reverse supply chain system consisting of an original equipment manufacturer and a retailer. A return policy agreement is also considered in which unsatisfied customers with the purchase of a new item may return the item for a refund. The returned items are collected and only the repairable ones are refurbished through a contracted 3PL provider and then offered to customers at a lower price than the new items. A return policy agreement applied on the refurbished items is also considered. A linear dependent demand function, in which customers are sensitive to the prices and the return policy of the sold items (new and refurbished), is used. The chapter investigated the effect of adopting a dual-channel strategy (retail and online channels) on the behavior of the supply chain system while taking inventory decisions, return policy and refurbishing costs into consideration. Two strategies were analyze. The first strategy analyzed the behavior of the system when the supply chain is composed of a single-channel and in which standard and refurbished standard items are offered through the retailer. The second strategy analyzed the behavior of the system when the dual-channel strategy is adopted where standard items are offered through the retail channel whereas customized and refurbished items (including refurbished standard and refurbished customized) are offered directly through the online channel. In both strategies, the objective was to maximize the total profit of the system by finding the optimal pricing strategy and inventory decisions under different return policies. One thousand numerical example were solved from which one numerical example was randomly selected. The results showed that the dual-channel strategy is more profitable than the singlechannel strategy and that the optimal prices in the single channel strategy are not affected by the adoption of the dual-channel strategy. The results also indicated that the more generous the return 134 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

policy is, the higher the selling prices and the profits. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted (by varying the values of different input parameters) to determine how the optimal pricing decisions and the optimal profits are affected. From these sensitivity analysis, specific managerial insights using marketing and operational management strategies were provided.

CHAPTER 6. DUAL-CHANNEL SUPPLY CHAIN WITH
LEARNING AND FORGETTING EFFECTS
This chapter considers a dual-channel supply chain where learning and forgetting occur in the production of the standard and core items. The objective is to investigate the effects of learning and forgetting on pricing and inventory decisions in a dual-cannel supply chain. The performance measure is total profit. This chapter has seven sections. Section 6.1 briefly presents the learning and forgetting process. Section 6.2 describes the problem. Section 6.3 and 6.4 presents the assumptions and notations. Section 6.5 presents the developed models. Sections 6.6 and 6.7 present numerical examples and the sensitivity analysis, respectively, and discuss the results. Finally, Section 6.8 summarizes and concludes the chapter.

6.1 The learning and forgetting process
The literature discussed several learning and forgetting models in the past (Jaber, 2006a, 2011). The learn-forget curve model (LFCM) is one of these models that has solid theoretical and empirical evidence (Jaber and Bonney, 2003). The learning process of the LFCM follows the Wright learning curve (WLC) model, while the forgetting process is a mirror image of it (Globerson et al., 1989). The WLC is expressed as:  = 1  - (6.1)

where  is the time (cost) to produce the th unit, 1 is the time (cost) to produce the first unit,  is the cumulative quantity produced (production count), and  is the learning curve (LC) exponent; where 0 <  < 1 and  = - log()/ log(2), and  is the learning rate expressed as a

136 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

percentage. The forgetting curve (FC) is expressed as (Globerson et al., 1989; Jaber and Bonney, 1996, 2003):  =  1    (6.2)

 is the time (cost) for the th unit of lost experience of the FC,  1 is the intercept, and  where  is the forgetting exponent. In the LFCM, unlike in Eq. (6.2), the forgetting exponent, f, varies from one production cycle to another, i.e., 0    1where i = 1, 2, ..., and is expressed as: (1 - ) log( +  ) log(1 + /( +  ))

 =

(6.3)

where  is the time for total forgetting to occur,  is the production quantity in cycle  up to the point of interruption, and  is the equivalent number of units remembered at the beginning of the  th cycle (cumulative experience). The term ( +  ) is the equivalent units of cumulative production by the end of the  th cycle, and is computed from Eq. (6.1) as follows:
 +

( +  ) =  1 ()-  
=1

 +

1  -  =

0

1 ( +  )1- 1 -  

(6.4)

The number of units remembered at the beginning of the cycle ( + 1) is given from Jaber and Bonney (1996) as follows: +1 = ( +  )(+ )/) 
-( /)

(6.5)

137 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

where 1 = 0,   -1 =1  and  is the number of units that would have been accumulated if production had not ceased for  units of time and can be computed from Eq. (6.4) as follows:
1- 1 1/(1-)

 = {

[( +  )] +  }

(6.6)

When a full transfer of learning occours, we have  = -1 =1  and when partial or total forgetting occurs, we have   0.

6.2 Model Description
Consider a dual-channel supply chain consisting of a vendor and a retailer (see Fig. 6.1). In the first channel, the vendor produces a standard item from an unfinished core item with some added basic features. The item then enters a make-to-stock (MTS) process and is then sold to customers through a retail channel. In this channel, the vendor and the retailer use a vendor managed inventory with a consignment stock (VMI-CS) agreement. In the second channel, the vendor builds product to order (BTO) from the core items, customizes them based on the end customer's order and sells them directly to end customers online (thereby bypassing the retailer). The production of standard and core items is intermittent, improves with learning and deteriorates with production breaks (Jaber and Bonney, 1999; Jaber, 2011). The learning and forgetting process follows the LFCM (introduced in Section 6.1). Transfer of learning between cycles could be full (no forgetting) or partial (some forgetting). No transfer of learning means total forgetting of knowledge. Customized items may significantly differ from one another, suggesting that the knowledge a worker gains in producing one product is not transferable to another. Therefore, for simplicity and to keep the chapter concise, it is assumed that learning and forgetting do not occur in the BTO process. This will be dealt with in future work.

138 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

The objective of this chapter is to maximize the profit of the supply chain (both for the single- and the dual-channel strategy) by optimizing prices, production and order quantities, and the number of shipments. The chapter starts by analyzing the single-channel (retail channel), followed by the dual-channel supply chain. The results of the analyses are compared and discussed to draw insights on the relative performance of both channels.

6.3 Assumptions
The following additional assumptions are made: (1) All input parameters are known and constant in time. (2) Shortages are not allowed. (3) Lead-time between the vendor and the retailer is zero. 139 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

(4) A quoted delivery lead-time (customer's waiting time for a customized item) is considered. (5) The vendor's setup cost and the retailer's ordering cost are fixed and independent of the order/production quantities. (6) The online and the retailer channel compete for customers. The share of customers preferring the online (retailer) channel is given. (7) An infinite planning horizon is considered.

6.5 Mathematical models
6.5.1 Single-channel strategy
Although the single-channel model considered in this chapter is similar to the one developed by Zanoni et al. (2012), it differs from it in three distinct ways. First, Zanoni et al. (2012) assumed a constant demand, whereas this model assumes a price-dependent demand. Second, this model adopts a profit maximization whereas Zanoni et al. (2012) aimed for a cost minimization. This assumption affects pricing and inventory decisions because of the price dependency of demand. Third, this model corrects the estimation of the production time in Zanoni et al. (2012) when the process is subjected to learning and forgetting effects. The VMI-CS has been used by different industries (e.g. the automobile/auto part industry, the consumer electronics industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the papermaking industry) because of its economic benefits (Zanoni et al., 2012; Batarfi et al., 2016, 2017). Wal-Mart, Procter and Gamble, Dell, Barilla, Costco, and Campbell's Soup use VMI-CS (Cigolini et al., 2004). In the single-channel scenario, the vendor sells the standard item to the retailer at a wholesale price  . The vendor ships the standard item in equal batches of size  to the retailer's facility

142 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

every  units of time, where  =  /  . The retailer sells the standard item to customers at a retail price  , where  >  >  , and pays the vendor only when the items are withdrawn from inventory. The vendor continues producing and shipping the standard item until the retailer's inventory reaches a maximum. Figure 6.2 illustrates the behavior of the VMI-CS inventory policy at the vendor's and the retailer's side when learning and forgetting are not considered (henceforth policy 0).

Learning in production shortens the time to produce a batch and accumulates inventory at a faster rate. The vendor produces , batches of size , in , units of time and delivers them to the retailer in cycle  (where  = 1, 2, 3, ...). Zanoni et al. (2012) used the method of Salameh et al. (1993) to calculate , , which is given by integrating Eq. (6.1) over the proper limits as:

where 1, =  1 (, + 1)

. Eq. (6.7) underestimates the value of , (Jaber and Bonney,

1998) and, therefore, has to be modified. To improve the estimation ability of (6.7), the exponent  has to change with every  th cycle (i.e. assuming , instead of  ). Jaber and Bonney (1998) provided the exact approximation of , . To find an expression for , , set Eq. (6.7), after replacing  with , , equal to the exact term from Jaber and Bonney (1998) as: 1, 1 1-, 1- 1- (, , ) = (, , + , ) - ,  1 - , 1 -

The parameters, ,  and  are used in approximating Eq. (6.8) (refer to Appendix A for details). Zanoni et al. (2012) suggested three production and shipment policies for the vendor. These policies differ from one another with respect to the times of shipments and batch sizes. The sequence of production and interruption periods, in turn, affect learning and forgetting. The three policies are provided below and summarized in Table 6.1. 1. Policy I: This policy releases shipments of equal sizes in equal time intervals. 2. Policy II: This policy releases shipments of unequal sizes in equal time intervals. 3. Policy III: This policy releases shipments of equal sizes in unequal time intervals. Zanoni et al. (2012) divided policy I into three sub-policies that affect the behavior of inventory at the side of the vendor, but not the retailer except for one policy. The chapter also considers a base case policy, policy 0, with no learning and forgetting (Batarfi et al., 2016).

This chapter assumes, a price-dependent linear demand function at the single-channel strategy (retailer's side), which is expressed as (Hua et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012, 2013; Batarfi et al., 2016):  =  -   (6.10)

6.5.2 Dual-channel strategy
Now, an online channel is added to the retail channel to form a dual-channel. The objective is to see how adding an online channel affect the pricing and inventory decisions and subsequently supply chain profitability. The vendor sells a standard item (retail channel) and a customized item (online channel). The standard item follows the inventory policies of Section 6.5.1. The customized item follows BTO. Customers select, from an online list, features (grouped in sets) to add to the core item. Once an online order is received by the vendor, the core item is instantly customized and shipped to the customer. No back-ordering or work-in-progress inventory situations are assumed. This is common MC industries (e.g., Dell) with BTO (Mukhopadhyay and Setoputro, 2005). Core items follow the economic production quantity (EPQ) model.

157 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

Custom features are shipped to the vendor on as-needed basis indicating zero inventory (Batarfi et al., 2016).  represent a set of variants, where    and  = 1,2, ... , . Each variant  represents one core item and at least one additional custom feature, , where  = 1, 2, ... , . The production cost,  , and the selling price,  , of a unit of variant  depends on the number of  feature(s) added to the core item. It is assumed that  includes the cost of one core item, the cost of the custom feature(s) and a fixed processing cost for each customized item. To avoid trivial problems, assuming  >  , the wholesale price of the standard item is less than the selling price of a customized item. This is not an arbitrary condition, because if  <  , the retailer or any other arbitrator can obtain the item from the vendor's online channel at a lower price (Hua et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012, 2013). In a traditional EPQ model (no learning and forgetting effects) the vendor produces  units of the core item at a production rate  in  units of time, where  =  / and  is the demand of the online channel. Therefore, the level of inventory of the core item will increase at a rate of  -  . The vendor will continue production until the inventory level reaches a maximum of  (1 -  / ). The core item is consumed during the production run, and the vendor will start production in the next cycle after the inventory level has been depleted. When learning and forgetting are considered in the production run of the core items, the EPQ inventory behavior is affected (see Figure 6.8). At the beginning of each interval  , the inventory of the core item builds up at a rate  while depleting at a constant rate of , . , is defined as the time required to produce , units of core items until the inventory reaches a maximum level of  , and , as the time required to deplete  , where  = , + , .

Figure 6.8 The inventory behavior of the vendor for the core customizable item with learning and forgetting effects Due to customers' heterogeneity in their preferences between the standard and the customized items, it is assumed that there are two major factors affecting the demands for the retail channel and the online channel: the first is the selling prices of the two items (i.e. standard and customized), and the second is the quoted delivery lead-time of the customized items,  . Following Hua et al. (2010), Huang et al. (2013, 2012), and Batarfi et al. (2016), a linear demand function is assumed. Specifically, the demand function of the two channels take the following forms:

 and  represent the demands of the retail channel and the online channel, respectively. where  The term  (0 <  < 1), represents the share of the primary demand, , going to the online channel, which is referred to in the literature as customer's acceptance (preference) of the online channel, whereas the term (1 - ) is the share of the primary demand going to the retail channel. The two parameters  and  represent the price elasticity (sensitivity) of  and  , respectively. The price elasticity here is defined as the amount of decrease (increase) in the market demand when the price increases (decreases) by one dollar. The cross price sensitivity, , which reflects the degree to which the two items sold through the two channels are substitutable, is assumed to be symmetric. It has to be noted that  >  and  > , indicating that the self-price effects are greater than the cross-price effects, a very common assumption used in the economic and operations management literature (Huang et al., 2013). The quoted delivery lead-time of the online channel,  , is defined as the time that a customer needs to wait from the time an order is placed through the online channel to the time that the item is delivered to the customer (Webster, 2002). The parameters  and  are the elasticity of the quoted delivery lead-time to changes in  of the two demands (retail channel and the online channel), respectively. For example, when  increases by one unit,  units of  will be lost, of  and  -  ( <  ) units will be lost to both which  units of that will be transferred to  channels (Hua et al., 2010). 160 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

In the next subsections, we reinvestigate the total profits of both firms (the vendor and the retailer) when the dual-channel strategy is adopted. The investigation is carried out for all policies discussed in Section 6.5.1. It has to be noted that the vendor's profit in all reinvestigated policies is majorly affected due to the adoption of the dual-channel strategy, whereas the only difference between the retailer's profit in the single channel strategy and the dual-channel strategy is just in the demand  of the dual-channel strategy). function (i.e.  in the single-channel strategy is replace with  6.5.2.1 Policy 0

6.6 Numerical example
Numerical examples to illustrate the behavior of the developed models for the single- and dualchannel strategies and their inventory policies, with and without learning and forgetting effects, are provided in this section. The results of both strategies are compared and analyzed to determine when it is profitable for the vendor to introduce an online channel, and which inventory policy is most profitable for the supply chain. For simplicity and conciseness, it is assumed in this section that the vendor offers one customizable item. However, the mathematics of the dual-channel strategy consider multiple customizable products. The values of some input parameters were taken from Jaber and Bonny (1998), Zanoni et al. (2012) and Batarfi et al. (2016), while the values of the other parameters were assumed within reason and in accordance with the assumptions made and conditions presented in this chapter. The breakdown of the unit holding cost into financial and physical storage is as suggested by Waters (2003). VMI-CS policy works when it is cheaper for the vendor to store items at the retailer's workhouse; i.e. 1 > 2 +  . The learning rate ( and  ) is 87%, corresponding to  =  = -log()/ log (2) = 0.2009. The time to produce the first unit of the standard item is 1 = 1/  and the time to produce the first unit of the core item is 1 = 1/ . Table 6.2 lists the values of the input parameters used in the numerical examples.

The optimal solutions were found using a similar solution procedure to the one developed by Jaber and Goyal (2008). The decision variables for the single-channel strategy are  and  and for the dual-channel strategy   ,   and  . A subscript i ( = 1, 2, ... , 10) is added to each decision variable as their values change with every cycle because of learning and forgetting effects. Each cycle  for every policy (policies I.1, I.2, I.3, II and III) is optimized independently from the previous cycle and the values of the optimal solutions are averaged over the ten consecutive cycles. The optimal results for all policies of the single-channel and the dual-channel are summarized in Table 6.3.
0 In Table 6.3, the optimal price of the standard item is  = $389.80 and the optimal lot size is 0 0 0   = 2 Ã 438 = 876 units. The corresponding supply chain total profit is  =

$2,581,710.10. Comparing the results of the single-channel strategy shows that with learning and
I.1 I.2 I.3 II III forgetting the optimal price of the standard item drops to around  =  =  =  =  

169 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

$379 and the optimal lot size for all policies, expect policy III, increase. Table 6.3 shows that learning in production increases the supply chain total profit. For example, comparing policy 0 to
I.1 policy I.1, the price of the standard item in policy I.1 decreases by 3% ( = 378.98), the lot size I.1 I.1 I.1 increases by 4% (, , = 908 units) and the profit increases by 6% ( = $2,739,445.46).

Table 6.3 also shows that for policy 0 in the dual-channel strategy the optimal prices of the standard
0 0 item and the customized items are  = $409 and  = $1427.3, respectively, the optimal lot 0 0 size of the standard item is     = 2 Ã 369 = 738 units and the optimal production quantity of 0 the core customizable item is  = 354 units. The corresponding supply chain total profit is 0  = $4,808,104.99. With learning and forgetting effects, the optimal average prices of both I.1 I.1 I.2 I.3 II III the standard and the customized items reduce to  =  =  =  =   $399 and  = I.3 I.2 II III  =  =  =   $1413, respectively. The optimal lot sizes of standard increase for all

policies except for policy III. The supply chain total profit also increases for all policies. Comparing the results of the two strategies (single-channel and dual-channel), it was found that adopting the dual-channel strategy increases the total profit of the supply chain. The findings also show that in both strategies, both players (the vendor and the retailer) benefit from learning in production. Moreover, the results indicate that in both strategies, policy II generates the highest profit and policy III generated the least profit compared to all other policies with learning and forgetting effects. Furthermore, the results indicate that customers benefit from the coordination policies proposed in this chapter (as the prices of the products decrease, customers are able to consume more, which increases their benefit/utility).

6.7 Sensitivity analysis
This section investigates the effects of varying the values of the learning and forgetting parameters, B and LR, on the optimal decisions and the behavior of the single- and dual-channel models developed earlier. The results of the sensitivity analysis are then discussed to draw some managerial insights.

6.7.1 Effects of varying the time for total forgetting
In this subsection, the time for total forgetting is varied from 0.08 year (30 days) to 10 years while fixing LR at 87%. The results of the single channel strategy in Table 6.4 show that when the value of the time for total forgetting of the standard item,  , increases from 0.08 to 10 years, the average total profit of the supply chain,  , for each policy increases, while the average lot size of the standard item (  ) decreases. Noticeably, the average price of the standard item,  , is insensitive to changes in  , and so are demand and revenues. Policy III is the least profitable, while policy I.2 is the most profitable. These findings suggest that learning positively affects competitiveness and efficiency of the supply chain, whereas forgetting impedes these attributes. The results in Table 6.4 are different from those of Zanoni et al. (2012) who showed that policy I.1 is the most sensitive, while policy I.3 is the least sensitive to the changes in  . The difference in the results can be attributed to two main factors. First, the proposed models in this chapter adopt a profit maximization Â­ and not a cost minimization Â­ approach with a price-dependent (and not a constant) demand. Second, Zanoni et al. (2012) used the model of Salameh et al. (1993) that underestimates the effects of learning and forgetting on the production and holding costs.

A sensitivity analysis of the policies of the dual-channel strategy was performed for changes in  (standard) and  (core) from 0.08 to 10 years. The results for policy I.1, I.2, I.3, II and III are summarized in Tables 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9, respectively. The results show that the supply chain average total profit,  , increased for all policies. The average lot size of the standard item (    ) and the average production quantity of the core item,  , decreased. Prices of the standard and the customized items,  and  , were shown to be insensitive to  and  . The results also indicate that the supply chain system performed better when  <  . For example, when  = 0.08 and  = 0.5, the total profit of the system,  = $4,961,203.63 in policy I.1. Whereas, when  >  ( = 0.5 and  = 0.08), the supply chain total profit performed better,  = $4,971,724.48. Comparing the results of the single- and dual-channel, the results show that the dual-channel strategy outperforms the single-channel strategy. The results also show that policy III in both strategies generates the lowest average profit, whereas policy II in the dual-channel strategy generates the highest average profit. Comparing the results of the two strategies with those of policy 0 show that learning improves competitiveness by lower the process and increasing demand and reducing inventory-related costs. The effects of learning are more prevalent when forgetting effects are insignificant (large values of Br and Bd). The findings in Tables 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, and 6.9 show that the profit of the retailer for all policies reduces considerably, compared to policy 0, when the vendor undergoes learning-based improvements, whose profit increases significantly. The vendor clusters the additional profits and savings from learning. To sustain collaboration, the vendor has to compensate the retailer for its losses. Mitigating the effects of forgetting could be achieved through training and worker transfer

policies in a manufacturing environment where workers perform functionally different tasks, and possibly through increasing the factor of similarity between the tasks (Jaber et al., 2003). Moreover, studies has shown that when workers are exposed to shorter spaced learning (training) sessions the results of retaining the information is by far better than massing the learning (training) in one whole session (SikstrÃ¶m and Jaber, 2012).

6.7.2 Effects of varying the learning rate
This subsection investigates the effect of the learning rate,  , on the behavior of the developed models. Dar-El et al. (1995, p. 273) categorize  into three different groups:  = 70-75% (fast),  = 75-80% (moderate),  = 85-90% (slow); also refer to Jaber (2006b). Accordingly, three different values of LR are considered, 70% (br = 0.5146), 80% (br = 0.3219), and 90% (br = 0.1520). Table 6.10 shows that as the learning rate of producing the standard item,  , becomes faster, the performance of the supply chain improves, i.e.,  increases,  decreases, demand
I.1 increases and   , decreases. For example, policy I.1 in Table 6.10, when LR = 90%,  = I.1 I.1 I.1 $2,719,422.22,  = $380.35, and   = 889 units, in contrast, when, when LR = 70%, I.1 I.1 I.1 I.1  = $2,782,028.43,  = $376.17, and   = 864 units.

Table 6.11 shows how the performance of the dual-channel model varies for every inventory policy and different values of  and  . The results indicate that fast learnings rates increase 
I.1 and decrease  ,  ,     , and  . For example, in policy I.1 when  =  = 90% ,  = I.1 I.1 I.1 I.1 I.1 $4,951,104.17,  = $400.67,  = $1,415.27,     = 756 units and  = 585 units. I.1 I.1 I.1 However, when  =  = 70%,  = $5,029,706.82,  = $396.36,  = $1,407.99, I.1 I.1 I.1     = 730 units and  = 462 units. The results also indicate that supply chain performs

better when the learning rate of the standard item,  , is faster than the learning rate of the core customizable item,  (e.g.  >  ). The results suggest that faster learning shortens production time and reduces the lot size and subsequently production and inventory costs. Lowering costs mean better competitiveness and profitability. Managers can achieve a fast learning rate through training and better worker-task assignment. Having a flexible and cross-trained workforce increases responsiveness to changes in product or market requirements. Schilling et al. (2003), for example, noted that learning rates are faster for workers who perform variety of tasks than for those performing a repetitive task or a groups of unrelated tasks. This notion has its parallel in the psychology literature where shifting learning context (novelty) improves performance and mitigates forgetting effects (SikstrÃ¶m and Jaber, 2012).

6.8 Summary and Conclusions
This chapter investigated the effects of learning and forgetting in a two-level single-and dualchannel strategy supply chain. The vendor in the single-channel produces and sells a standard item through a retail channel. The vendor in the dual-channel, and in parallel to the standard item channel, produces a core item, customizes it and sells directly to customers through an online channel. The vendor and the retailer follow the vendor-managed inventory with consignment stock agreement. The inventory behavior of the core items follows the economic production quantity model. No inventory was considered for customized items. Each strategy was investigated for six different inventory policies. Policy 0, a base case, does not consider learning and forgetting effects. The remaining five policies (policy I.1, I.2, I.3, II, and III) do. The profits of the centralized singleand dual-channel supply chain models were maximized by optimizing the prices of the standard and/or the customized item, the lot sizes of the standard item and/or the core item and the number of shipments. The numerical results showed that the dual-channel strategy outperformed the single channel strategy with the profit being the performance measure. The results suggested that learning, despite being impeded by forgetting, reduces inventory-related costs thereby allowing the chain to reduce the prices of its product(s), which increases demand and subsequently sales. Although the five policies (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, and III) performed better than policy 0, policy II in both strategies performed the best and policy III the worst among the five policies. The sensitivity of the single- and dual-channel supply chains were investigated for different values of the time for total forgetting, B, and the learning rate, LR. The results showed that faster forgetting, small values of B, and slower learning, and higher values of LR, all reduce profits.

184 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

However, B was found to have very little effect on prices. On the other hand, lower forgetting intensity, a very large B, and faster learning improve competitiveness and profitability. The results showed that when the vendor considers the learning and forgetting effects savings and additional profits reaped from improvements shift to its side. The vendor has to compensate the retailer for its loss so as to foster collaboration. Compensation may take the form of profit sharing or price/quantity discounts.

CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
This chapter summaries the research presented in this thesis and discusses its main contributions. It also presents the limitation of this thesis and suggests future research directions.

7.1 Thesis summary
Significant changes have affected the modern business world and the management of supply chains. Some of these changes are attributed to the recent technological developments of the internet and e-commerce technologies. These have influenced customers' purchase patterns , thereby motivating manufacturers to adopt a dual-channel strategy (a mixture of a traditional retail channel and an online channel). The research presented in this thesis investigates the effect of adopting a dual-channel strategy on the performance of a two-level (vendor-retailer) supply chain. The performance measure is a profit maximization. The following chapters summarizes the models investigated in this thesis: Chapter 4 investigated two scenarios. The first scenario discussed a single-channel strategy in which a standard item is produced using make-to-stock processes and is sold to customers through a retail channel. The second scenario discussed the effect of adopting a dual-channel strategy on the supply chain, in which a standard item is sold through a retail channel and customized items are sold to customers through an online channel. The customized items, which are produced based on build-to-order processes, are made of a core item and custom added features. It was assumed that the inventory behavior between the vendor and the retailer follows the consignment stock agreement. No inventory was assumed for the finished customized items and the custom added features. However, it was assumed that the production-inventory behavior of the core item follows

186 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

the economic production quantity model. A numerical analysis was performed on both strategies, and the results were compared. The results showed that the dual-channel strategy outperforms the single-channel strategy and that the vendor is the one who benefits from the strategy by having a higher markup margin and profit. On the other hand, the retailer's profit was shown to decrease due to a decrease in demand for the standard items. The developed models were investigated for different varying conditions (production rate, holding cost, ordering cost, customer acceptance, quoted delivery lead-time, and product differentiation) to determine how inventory policies, price markups, and the supply chain total profit are affected. The results showed that changing some of the input parameters have a major impact on the optimal decisions of the supply chain system. Chapter 5 developed a closed-loop (forward and reverse logistics) dual-channel supply chain system. The system is comprised of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. A return policy in which unsatisfied customers can return the purchased item for a refund was also considered. The objective was to examine the effect of different return policies on the behavior of supply chain systems before and after adopting the dual-channel. In both strategies, the chapter analyzed the change in the profit, the pricing and inventory decisions. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis were provided and their results discussed. The results demonstrated that in both strategies, the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demand, the selling prices and the overall profit. The results also indicated that adopting a dual-channel strategy is more profitable to the supply chain. Chapter 6 investigated the effects of learning and forgetting modeling on the adoption of a twolevel dual-channel supply chain system. Two strategies were considered: a single-channel strategy and a dual-channel strategy. Each strategy, was investigated for six different policies. The first policy (policy 0) discussed the behavior of both inventories without considering learning and 187 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

forgetting effects. The rest of the other policies (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, and III) discussed five different shipment arrangements between the vendor and the retailer when learning and forgetting effects are considered. The objective was to maximize the total profit of the supply chain system by finding the optimal pricing and inventory decisions. A numerical example was used to test the developed models and to obtain results. Sensitivity analysis were also used to build further upon the numerical results and to draw specific managerial decisions. The results suggested that learning, despite being impeded by forgetting, reduces inventory-related costs thereby allowing the chain to reduce the prices of its product(s), this increases demand and subsequently sales. Although the five policies (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, and III) performed better than policy 0, policy II in both strategies performed the best and policy III the worst among the five policies. Moreover, the results showed that when the vendor undergoes learning and forgetting effects, savings and additional profits reaped from improvements shift to its side. The vendor has to compensate the retailer for its loss so as to foster collaboration. Compensation may take the form of profit sharing or price/quantity discounts. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that faster forgetting and slower learning all reduce profits.

7.2 Thesis contributions
The main research contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows: The first contribution of this thesis is presented in Chapter 4. The presented research in Chapter 4 is the first to address a dual-channel supply chain in which two type of items are sold and in which inventory policies are considered. It is believed that the chapter contributed to the growing research on the dual-channel supply chain and the inventory management of the supply chain literature. Specifically, the contribution of Chapter 4 is two-fold. First, the chapter investigated the effect of adopting a dual-channel system where standardized and customized items are sold, on the total 188 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

profit of a supply chain with price discrimination for customized items. This marketing strategy has been receiving increasing attention by business and researchers. Moreover, Chapter 4 contributed to the literature by studying the inventory management policy for standardized, customized and core items, where a unit of a core item is the basis for producing a standardized and/or customized items. The content of this chapter is published in a peer-reviewed journal (Applied Mathematical Modelling, 40(21), 9454-9473; doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2016.06.008). The second contribution of this thesis is presented in Chapter 5. To the best of the author's knowledge, the mathematical models in this chapter are the first to address reverse logistics for a two-level dual-channel supply chain system. To be specific, the mathematical models of Chapter 5 contributed to the growing literature of the reverse logistics supply chain by investigating the effects of different return policies on a single-channel and a dual-channel supply chain system. Moreover, Chapter 5 studied the optimal pricing decisions (of both newly produced and refurbished items), the optimal inventory decisions (including the production/ordered quantity) and the number of shipments in a reverse logistics supply chain and when a return policy is considered. The content of this chapter is published in a peer-reviewed journal (Computers & Industrial Engineering, 106, 58Â­82; doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2017.01.024). The third and final contribution of this thesis is presented in Chapter 6. It is believed that the research in this chapter made an original contribution to the supply chain literature by investigating the effect of adopting a dual-channel strategy on the performance of a two-level supply chain system (in which prices and inventory decisions are decision variables) and when learning and forgetting effects are considered. Considering learning and forgetting effects in such systems increases competitiveness by reducing costs and increasing sales. Although it is important, there is no paper in the literature that combines the two streams. Furthermore, studying learning and 189 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

forgetting in a dual-channel supply chain may lead to interesting insights due to the following reasons. First, moving from a situation where the company produces only a single standard item to a scenario where it offers a customized item in addition ultimately takes away scale effects from the standard item, which may imply lower learning and higher forgetting. This aspect may significantly influence the relative efficiency of the dual channel supply chain (as compared to a traditional setup), and therefore it has to be considered when deciding about which structure to adopt. Secondly, neglecting learning and forgetting in a decision support model may lead to wrong decision support and the selection of a wrong channel strategy or production policy, which may lead to unnecessarily high costs for the supply chain. As a result, it is important to study learning and forgetting in the described context, which is the subject of the chapter at hand. The content of this chapter was submitted for review in a peer-reviewed journal.

7.3 Future research directions
The assumptions made in this thesis were necessary to make the developed mathematical models possible to track and solve. The models developed may be viewed by some as representing an ideal situation or an over-abstraction of the problems, which may affect their solutions. However, despite the limiting assumptions made, it is worth noting that the problems addressed in this thesis represent what has been in practice by some businesses, to some extent. Therefore, these models have been developed such that they may be applied to real-world scenarios with some modifications, and with similar solutions. The limitations of the presented research in this thesis are as follows: This thesis assumed a deterministic dependent demand function, which can become random by adding noise to it. A stochastic component can either be of an additive or multiplicative form (Petruzzi and Dada, 1999). A time-dependent demand function could also be used to test the dynamicity of the models and its 190 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

parameters. This thesis uses sensitivity analysis to capture this. However, having the parameter as a function of time in the developed models would make the models more realistic and dynamic but complex. Finding closed-form solutions could be challenging and worthy of another doctoral thesis. Moreover, the research in this thesis assumed that the customized items are sold only by the vendor; however, it would be interesting to offer standard and customized items in both channels. This thesis also assumed that the custom features are independent of each other. In other cases, however, these features could be dependent on each other. If the custom features are dependent, then maybe introducing a dependent feature and/or its family would affect the entire mathematics of this thesis. In addition, selecting a specific custom feature may eliminate the selection of other features to be included with the customization. This will most probably require the introduction of binary variables "yes" or "no" choices. Furthermore, the models proposed in this thesis considered a centralized scenario. Developing a decentralized scenario of the proposed models using a game theoretic (i.e., the vendor is the leader and the retailer is the follower) and comparing them with the centralized scenario could represent a valuable contribution to the supply chain literature. The absence of real-world data is also a limitation in this thesis. However, if the data becomes available, then the models of this thesis could be tested. If errors are significant, then the models should be revisited and modified. Perhaps using a control theory approach with feedback loops could result in having the models move closer to reality. Additionally, this thesis did not account for economic and strategic aspects. This could be an interesting aspect to investigate and develop. The mathematical models presented in Chapter 4 assumed that the markup margin between the vendor and the retailer is the same as between the vendor and customers. This limitation could be addressed in future works. Another limitation in this thesis is that the custom features are assumed 191 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017

to be outsourced; it will be interesting to see the effect of moving some or all of the production of these features in-house at the manufacturer's facility. This problem would be interesting, and perhaps challenging, to model, solve and analyze. The mathematical models in Chapter 5 assumed that returned unrepairable items cannot be recovered and are disposed of. Future research may consider that unrepairable items can be disassembled to recover useful components and parts (Tahirov et al., 2016) and that an item can be refurbished for a limited number of times (El Saadany et al., 2013). The quality and acquisition price of returned items, learning-by-doing of remanufacturing activities, and frequency of remanufacturing need also to be thought about in a future work (El Saadany and Jaber, 2010; Martin et al., 2010; Jaber, 2011). Future research may also consider zone-based or clustering based return approach where the return policy depends on the item and the culture of customers. The mathematical models in Chapter 6 considered no learning and forgetting for the customized items. Addressing this limitation requires accounting for the inter-arrival time between orders of the same type of customized items and the patterns of arrivals. It also requires developing a stochastic learning and forgetting model to investigate their effects in such an environment. Workforce flexibility and cross-training could also be investigated to address this limitation. Another limitation in is the assumption of perfect production; i.e., no defective units are generated that require rework. This also could be addressed in a future work by considering improvements in quality and setups. Finally, the models of Chapter 6 considered the forward flow. It is common that there are unsatisfied customers who would return their products to the retailer/vendor. This would be a challenging problem, especially when considering refurbishing or remanufacturing returns and selling them in a secondary market. Adding a reverse channel affects the pricing and inventory decisions of the forward channel. 192 Raaid Batarfi - April 2017
