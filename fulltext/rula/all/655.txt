Municipal Progress in Conformity to Greenbelt Legislation: Challenges in Implementation and to Greenbelt Integrity. Dorothy Moszynski, 2007, Environmental Applied Science and Management, Ryerson University.

ABSTRACT

Objective: To examine the progress of municipal conformity to Ontario Greenbelt legislation. One planner from each region and municipality within Greenbelt boundaries were interviewed, GIS displays were created, and Official Plans analyzed to examine the extent of conformity to the Greenbelt Plan, strength of policies, and plans for expansion. Results: Municipalities are generally supportive of Greenbelt goals; and are willing to conform at least at an official level. Future threats will therefore come from decisions on individual development applications and proposed expansions. Official Plans varied widely in level of conformity: some had general enthusiam while others appear unwilling to preserve greenbelt boundaries. Issues identified include process, implementation and integrity issues such as agricultural viability; environmental protection; urban boundary expansions; infrastructure and highway expansions and extensions; protection of lands outside the Greenbelt; mineral aggregate policies; housing affordability; political backing and public perception; and regional coordination issues.
